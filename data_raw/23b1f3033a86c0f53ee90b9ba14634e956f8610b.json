Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1b, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity.",

Vector-borne infectious diseases such as Dengue, West Nile have been resurging largely due to the spread of insecticide resistance, to socio-demographic changes, and to genetic mutations in the pathogens. More recently, chikungungya fever (CHIKF) has now emerged as the next important infection in South-East Asia, the Pacific region and Europe [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , making it a major threat that requires immediate attention. Recent epidemic resurgence of CHIKF in several African and Asian countries demonstrated that infection can spread alarmingly rapidly [6] [7] [8] [9] from limited early transmission that then developed into an unprecedented and unexpected epidemic, infecting 38% of the population as occurred in Reunion island [6, 8] . The appearance of cases in Europe, the United States and other countries by travelers returning from known outbreak areas underscores the contributory factors of increased human mobility, tourism, global climate change, and increases in insecticide resistance [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In this era of globalization, the threat of such disease epidemics should not be underestimated as such public health events could cripple public health systems and economies.",

Despite the fact that the clinical features of recent acute CHIKV infections from several countries have been described [16] [17] [18] , little is known about the long-term sequelae or the pathogenesis of arthropathy, and the acquisition of protective immunity remains unexplored. It has been proposed that CHIKVinduced arthritis or arthralgia is of immunopathologic origin [19, 20] . At present, there is no specific or effective treatment for CHIKF, and patient management is largely symptomatic relief and primarily anti-inflammatory drugs [8] . Given the expanding geographic range of CHIKV and its potential to rapidly cause large scale epidemics, it has become important to understand the immune and pathogenic mechanisms active during CHIKV infections in order to guide the development of targeted and effective control and treatment strategies.",

IL-10 and IFN-c have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CHIKF [21] , a global analysis of their specific involvement with disease severity has not yet been defined. Growth factors are usually produced in response to injury. Viral infections such as CHIKV, induce cellular damage which may lead to secretion of these factors; however, limited studies have been conducted [21] . In this study, we took the opportunity to conduct a detailed study on the patients from the first outbreak of CHIKF in Singapore [22, 23] . We measured circulating levels of a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in 10 laboratory confirmed cases of CHIKF, and compared them with healthy individuals. We next determined which biomarker was associated with infection and/or severity. We showed for the first time that CHIKV infection induced a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. We subsequently found that 3 specific biomarkers, namely IL-1b, IL-6, and RANTES levels, were associated with severe CHIKF.",

The levels of 8 plasma cytokines (IL-2R, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-a) were observed to be most significantly elevated (Figure 2a ) in CHIKF patients compared to uninfected subjects (P,0.05). Among these was proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6 which was very significant. Interestingly, another proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8 was down-regulated in these patients. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was found to be significantly raised in most of the patients (P,0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-2R and IL-5 were found to be increased in all patients.

This could be attributed to the rapid removal of human reservoirs through isolation, enhanced vector control, or the circulation of a virus strain of lower epidemic potential. Clinical features of our patients were similar to those reported in recent outbreaks [6] [7] [8] [9] [11] [12] [13] [14] [16] [17] [18] 21, 30] , indicating that although people are genetically diverse response to diseases is homogeneous across people in non-homogeneous populations. The majority of our patients was #45 years and had no premorbid condition. Unlike patients reported in the Reunion Island outbreak [6] , where the patients' underlying medical conditions could have contributed to the observed morbidities, our patients were younger and healthier. Furthermore, none of our patients was co-infected with dengue, as confirmed by RT-PCR and dengue enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)-IgM and IgG [31] . Hence, our immunologic observations can be largely attributed to acute CHIKV infection itself.",

            "text": "In recent years, most of the studies on CHIKF have been addressed with the clinical description of the disease [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 17, 18, 21] , the molecular nature of the virus [9, 10, 19] and diagnostics methods [8] [9] [10] 24] , and the interactions of the virus with its mosquito vector, Aedes [1] [2] [3] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Here, we describe for the first time the comprehensive systemic production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute CHIKV infection which may light the path ahead in understanding the innate response to the infection. We first showed that a wide range of cytokines such as IFN-a, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15 were produced in response to CHIKV infection. IFN-a is a potent antiviral cytokine and has been shown to strongly inhibit CHIKV in vitro [32] . The high levels of IFN-a that we detected provide a logical explanation for how the body rapidly brings CHIKV viremia under control [8, 11] . It has been shown that the main producers of IFN-a are plasmocytoid dendritic cells [33] and monocytes [34] . The profile of circulating cytokines revealed a predominance of Type 2 cytokines. Mainly IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were increased and those of IFN-c or TNF-a were unchanged as compared to noninfected controls. This suggests that acute CHIKV infection tilts the cytokine profile to anti-inflammatory response, which would argue against the common understanding of CHIKV infection which does not really support the common description of the CHIKV infection as an inflammatory disease [8] . Alternatively, it is possible that an inflammatory response might occur earlier when the virus is actively replicating, and then gets down-regulated by a counter-anti-inflammatory response when the virus is being eliminated from circulation. High levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and the presence of high levels of chemokines IP-10 and MIG (ligands of CXCR3 associated with Th1-type reactions) [35] , detected here would support this hypothesis. Further studies would be needed to clarify this issue. The Type 2 cytokines detected are also important mediators of B cell growth and maturation, and thus may allow the production of high levels of persisting anti-CHIKV IgG [5] .",

Here, 9 of the 10 patients manifested this pathology. IL-7 is known to have an important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis [39] , while IL-15 has been associated with the development of joint inflammation [40] . It has been proposed that expansion of a particular IL15-induced NK cell subsets was responsible for this phenomenon [41] . The role of IL-15 and NK cells in the development of CHIKV arthralgia would definitively be worth investigating. We did not detect TNF-a in the plasma of the patients with acute CHIKV infection. This is surprising since this cytokine has been detected repeatedly in the blood of patients suffering from other arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of these entities [42] . Thus, it is possible that CHIKV-induced arthralgia does not depend on TNF-a. Alternatively, TNF-a might be produced only locally. Analysis of synovial fluid or joint tissue immunohistochemistry would be necessary to provide important information on the role of TNF-a and other mediators.",

Using this definition, we observed that higher disease severity was associated with increased plasma levels of IL-1b and IL-6 and a decreased level in RANTES (Figure 3b ). IL-1b and IL-6, whose levels are already high in the CHIKV infected patients, are potent endogenous pyrogens [45] [46] [47] [48] . Therefore, elevations of IL-1b and IL-6 might account for the high fever in the severe cases. The increase production of IL-1b might also mediate the development of abrupt and persistent arthralgia since this cytokine is involved in the immunopathogenesis of many arthritic pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis [49] . On the contrary, T cell chemokine RANTES levels were significantly suppressed in severe CHIKF patients. Platelets are a major reservoir of RANTES in the peripheral circulation [50] , and severe CHIKF was characterized by thrombocytopenia. Thus, as mentioned above for EGF, thrombocytopenia can also reduce levels of circulating RANTES. Low levels of RANTES correlate with disease severity and mortality in individuals with severe malaria, who were also correspondingly thrombocytopenic [51] . Interestingly, it was observed in other studies that RANTES levels were up-regulated in dengue [48] , except for one single report from Cuba [52] . Since the symptoms of CHIKF mimic those of dengue fever, results obtained from this study strongly suggest that RANTES could be a potential biomarker that differentiates between these 2 clinically very similar diseases.",

Nonetheless, our definition of severe illness would have included patients with sepsis, a serious form of infection commonly associated with a temperature of .38uC and heart rate of .90/ minute [24] . Furthermore, we included thrombocytopenia of ,100610 9 /L as a criteria for severe CHIKF. Marked thrombocytopenia is a common feature of sepsis [25] and has been identified as a predictor of mortality [26, 27] . The degree of thrombocytopenia is a determinant of survival and once the platelet count decreases below 100610 9 /L, mortality continues to increase, even though the risk of bleeding does not [28] . A wide spectrum of disease has been reported in CHIKF ranging from asymptomatic infections, to self-limiting febrile illness [8] , to neurologic complications, and death [17] . The ''severe illness'' cohort in our study possibly represents a more severe form of selflimiting febrile illness, an intermediate group with higher levels of viremia (data not shown) and distinctly more severe clinical features (i.e. high temperature, tachycardia, and severe thrombocytopenia). Using this clinical phenotype, we have shown in this study that immune mediators are able to distinguish very mild disease from more severe forms of CHIKF disease at the acute stage. Follow-up studies will be required to determine if long-term sequelae are indeed different between non-severe and severe clinical presentations. Elucidating the association of disease severity with two cytokines and one chemokine can be useful in order to provide early identification and monitoring of patients with severe disease. Although this study is limited by the size of the outbreak, nevertheless, based on these observations, measurement of immune mediators could be helpful for the management of future outbreaks. This study strongly suggests these biomarkers be used for measuring disease severity and be tested in outbreaks in different populations and different strains. Once confirmed, they will be useful for follow-up studies, association studies, and prognosis for public health management. More importantly, these biomarkers can potentially lead to the development of modulators to reduce disease severity and to halt disease progression. ",

A multiplex biometric immunoassay, containing fluorescent dyed microspheres conjugated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a target protein, was used for cytokine measurement according to manufacturer's instructions (Biosource Human Cytokine 30-plex Assay, Invitrogen). The following groups of cytokines were: inflammatory (GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha); Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10); Cytokine II (IFN-alpha, IL-7, IL-12p40/p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17); Chemokines (Eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES); and Growth Factors (EGF, HGF, FGF-basic, G-CSF, VEGF). Briefly, 25 ul of plasma samples were diluted in 1:2 and incubated with antibody coupled beads for 2 h at RT uC. Complexes were washed twice with the use of a vacuum manifold before incubation with biotinylated detector antibody for 1 h at RT uC. Complexes were then washed twice followed by incubation with Streptavidin-phycoeryrhrin (RPE) for 30 min at RT uC. Complexes were washed thrice and incubated with wash buffer for another 3 min before detection in the Luminex 200 TM instrument. Results were acquired by the IS 2.3 software and the standard curves were plotted through a fiveparameter logistic curve setting.",

Hierarchical clustering is applied on the columns which represent the myriad of cytokine levels measurements (e.g.) based on McQuitty's or WPGMA method [56] where the distance between a pair of groups A and B is measured using the weighted arithmetic mean of all the pairwise distances between the data points in A and B. The rows which represent the suspected CHIKF patients and healthy individuals are left untouched. Seriation [57] is performed following the clustering approach to re-order the clustered data points using the minimum path length algorithm to minimize the sum of all the distances between adjacent columns.",
