Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is upregulated in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with unknown roles. In the present approach, cytosolic CYPA was found to be bound with EBNA1 into the nucleus. The amino acid 376-459 of the EBNA1 domain was important for the binding. CYPA depletion attenuated and ectopic CYPA expression improved EBNA1 expression in EBV-positive cells. The loss of viral copy number was also accelerated by CYPA consumption in daughter cells during culture passages. Mechanistically, CYPA mediated the connection of EBNA1 with oriP (origin of EBV DNA replication) and subsequent oriP transcription, which is a key step for the initiation of EBV genome replication. Moreover, CYPA overexpression markedly antagonized the connection of EBNA1 to Ubiquitinspecific protease 7 (USP7), which is a strong host barrier with a role of inhibiting EBV genome replication. The PPIase activity of CYPA was required for the promotion of oriP transcription and antagonism with USP7. The results revealed a strategy that EBV recruited a host factor to counteract the host defense, thus facilitating its own latent genome replication. This study provides a new insight into EBV pathogenesis and potential virus-targeted therapeutics in EBV-associated NPC, in which CYPA is upregulated at all stages.",

It contains a large genome approximately 172 kb in size and has two phases in its life cycle (the latent and lytic stages) (Yu et al., 2011; Hammerschmidt and Sugden, 2013) . EBV mainly spreads through the saliva of human host, infects B cells through the oral mucosal epithelium, and then transforms B lymphocytes into resting memory B cells through a series of viral latent transcription programs, thus establishing a lifelong latent infection pattern (Thorley-Lawson et al., 2013) . The majority of EBV infections in vivo are latent (Thorley-Lawson, 2015) . During EBV latency, the EBV genome exists in the form of episome DNA, few viral genes are expressed, and no virion is produced. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein that is expressed in all types of EBVassociated tumors (Lu et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2015) . Determining how EBV is able to maintain its stable latent status in host cells is a topic of interest, because it may provide understanding about the pathogenesis of EBV and new targets to inhibit the persistence of EBV genome in the therapy of EBV-associated cancers. EBV replication is under the control of some host and viral factors that are not fully understood. EBNA1 plays a key role in the replication and mitotic segregation of EBV DNA episomes to daughter cells (Yates and Guan, 1991; Frappier, 2012b) . EBNA1-mediated S-phase episome replication depends on binding of EBNA1 to the EBV origin of genome replication (oriP) (Reisman et al., 1985) . Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and their replication cycles depend on some host cell factors. For example, some studies suggested that cellular origin recognition complex (ORC) and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex are related to the DS element of oriP, implicating them in the initiation of EBV DNA replication (Frappier, 2012a; Capone et al., 2015) . These host factors may also be potential targets for antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is a protein with multiple functions as a typical member of the cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family (Braaten et al., 1996; Bahmed et al., 2012) . CYPA was discovered initially as an intracellular receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) (Braaten et al., 1996; Bahmed et al., 2012) . Studies have shown that CYPA can use IL-6 to induce cell signal conversion, activate tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear transport of transcription factor 3, and can bind and activate NF-\u03baB . CYPA is involved in the life cycles of multiple viruses and plays a critical role in their successful infectivity and replication, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus (VV), coronaviruses (CoVs), and feline coronavirus (Bose et al., 2003; Naoumov, 2014; Jyothi et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2015) . The interaction between CYPA and HIV protein promotes the replication and infection of HIV particles; CD147 is the main signal receptor of CYPA, and the two interact to regulate the early steps of HIV replication (Ciesek et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2015) . Conversely, CYPA suppresses the replication of some viruses, such as rotavirus, infectious bursal disease virus and influenza virus (Xu et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012) . However, the role and mechanism of CYPA in the function of EBV remain unknown. Our laboratory previously performed a proteomics study using NPC tissues and found that CYPA was upregulated from the early stages of NPC (atypical hyperplasia and stage I) to the malignancy stages (Yang et al., 2014) . Since EBV infection also occurs during the early stage of NPC (Morrison et al., 2004) , we speculated that a potential relationship might exist between CYPA and EBV, which initiated the present approach. Recently, we have reported that the exosomal CYPA level in NPC is positively related that of exosomal latent membrane protein 1, which is another latent protein of EBV. The result suggests a relationship between CYPA and EBV (Liu et al., 2019) .",

The USP7-EBNA1 interaction was selectively disrupted by deletion of EBNA1 residues 395-450 just upstream of the DNA binding domain, and the resulting EBNA1 mutant exhibited significantly increased DNA replication activity (Holowaty et al., 2003b) .

As it is known, KSHV also persists in infected cells mainly in a latent state, and LANA, is expressed in all latently KSHV-infected cells (Rainbow et al., 1997) .

To study the potential interaction between EBNA1 and CYPA, BiMC assay was performed. The BiMC assay is a useful tool for detection of protein-protein interactions in living cells, and the results can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Hudry et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014) . A diagram of the basic principle of the BiMC assay is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 . The EBNA1 protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the C-terminal fragment of the YFP (pCAGGS-Myc-EBNA1-CY), and CYPA was fused with the N-terminal fragment of YFP (pCAGGS-Flag-CYPA-NY). These two plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, with the single pCAGGS-Flag-CYPA-NY plasmid transfection as a negative control. The results showed that EBNA1 and CYPA interacted with each other in the nucleus (Figure 1A , Top). When the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence of EBNA1 was deleted, the proteins interacted in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1A) . This translocation showed the specificity of the interaction mediated by EBNA1 with an NLS. Cyclophilin B (CYPB) is another member of the cyclophilin family, but we did not detect any binding signal for CYPB-EBNA1 in the BiMC assay ( Figure 1A) . There was no fluorescence signal in the cells transfected with only single plasmid which was a negative control (Figure 1A , Lower). EBNA1 and CYPA/B expression in the BiMC assay was detected by WB ( Figure 1B) . We further evaluated EBNA1 and CYPA intracellular localization in EBVpositive cells by IF assays (Figure 1C) . The result showed that CYPA expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus in EBV-positive C2089 cells, while mainly in the cytoplasm of the EBV-negative HEK293 cells (Figure 1C) . The co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was used to verify the interaction of EBNA1 with CYPA. These results showed that both endogenous and exogenous CYPA interacted with EBNA1 (Figures 1D-F) . The plasmids pCAGGS-Myc-EBNA1 and pCAGGS-Flag-CYPA or pCAGGS-Flag-CYPB were transfected in HEK293 cells, Myc-EBNA1 was immuneprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Figure 1G , the result of co-IP assay further validated that EBNA1 interacted with CYPA but not CYPB.",

The plasmid structures are illustrated in Figure 2A . The BiMC assay revealed that YFP was reconstructed in HEK293T cells using wild-type EBNA1 and four of the mutants (EBNA1 1-90-CY, EBNA1 90-376-CY, EBNA1 459-607-CY and EBNA1 607-641-CY) but not the EBNA1 376-459-CY mutant (Supplementary Figure S3A) . Each negative control with single plasmid transfection is shown in Supplementary  Figure S3C . Subsequently, we co-transfected pCAGGS-Myc-EBNA1 or a pCAGGS-Myc-EBNA1 mutant plasmid with pCAGGS -Flag-CYPA into HEK293 cells. A co-IP assay using a Flag-tag antibody for the pulldown showed the same result (i.e., CYPA did not interact with EBNA1 376-459) ( Figure 2B ). This domain, which is also the region containing the USP7binding domain in EBNA1 (Figure 2A) , was thus critical for the binding of EBNA1 to CYPA. Co-expression of EBNA1 376-459-CY (only this one domain of EBNA1) and CYPA-NY recovered their binding function based on the BiMC assay results (Supplementary Figure S3B) . The NLS (amino acids 379-386) is also included in the domain containing amino acids 376-459, and thus YFP was detected in the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S3B) . These results indicated that amino acids 376-459 of EBNA1, which contain the USP7-binding domain, were essential for the interaction between EBNA1 and CYPA.",

In these cells, an oriP luciferase reporter, oriP-SV40-Luc was transiently transfected. After 24 h transfection, luciferase activities were detected. The EBNA1 activated oriP Luciferase was decreased by 3.5-fold in the luciferase assay compared to that in the control cells (C2089-shNC) due to CYPA depletion. In contrast, there was no effect on the transfection of an SV40-Luc reporter plasmid with CYPA depletion (P < 0.001, Figure 4C ), EBNA1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR. When EBNA1 was lacked, CYPA knockdown did not affect luciferase activity of oriP-SV40-Luc ( Figure 4C) . The results indicated that CYPA enhanced the EBNA1 activation of oriP transcription. The ChIP assay was used to further validate that CYPA played a role in EBNA1-oriP binding. pCAGGS-Myc-EBNA1 and oriP-SV40-Luc were co-transfected into HEK293-shNC and HEK293-shCYPA cells. As shown in Figure 4D , CYPA interference (shCYPA) reduced the EBNA1 binding to oriP DNA by approximately 50% compared to that of the control (shNC) in HEK293 cells (P < 0.05).",

            "text": "On the other hand, when CYPA was upregulated, the USP7 suppression in EBNA1-mediated replication could be reversed. This interaction is a type of quantity-driven winning for CYPA, because its rival USP7 is too powerful. It was reported that the affinity of USP7-EBNA1 was 10-fold higher than USP7-p53, implying the strong binding of USP7-EBNA1 (Saridakis et al., 2005) . The CsA treatment demonstrated that the PPIase activity of CYPA was required for this function. The schematic working model is shown as in Figure 7 . Cyclophilin A has been implicated in the life cycles of several viruses and plays a critical role in the successful infectivity and replication of these viruses, including some tumor viruses, such as HBV and HCV (Bose et al., 2003; Naoumov, 2014; Jyothi et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2015) . It has not been reported for the relationship between CYPA and KSHV, another tumor virus in the same family of gamma herpesvirus as EBV. Though CYPA is involved in the regulation of several viruses, its function mode is different from that in other viruses depending on the different mode of viral infection and replication. For example, the interaction between CYPA and HIV Gag was proposed to facilitate disassembly of the viral RNA containing core following virus entry and thus supports the efficient reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome (Luban et al., 1993; Ott, 2002) CYPA also enhances virus attachment to the host cell membrane through interactions with heparans (Saphire et al., 2000) and after membrane fusion through interaction with CD147, thereby promoting viral infection. In the present study, for the first time, we showed that CYPA was also utilized by EBV in the modulation of viral replication function in epithelial cells. Thus, CYPA is involved in the maintenance of the virus during its latency in host cells. EBNA1 mediates DNA episome replication from oriP (Frappier, 2012a) . Our results revealed that CYPA was recruited to influence EBNA1-oriP-mediated transcription. CYPA depletion significantly facilitated loss of EBV copy numbers (Figure 3F) , suggesting that impairment of EBNA-oriP binding further weakened successful replication and maintenance of the EBV genome.",

A previous study demonstrated that USP7 suppressed EBV replication (Holowaty et al., 2003b) . Here, we showed that EBV hijacked the host factor of elevated CYPA to counteract USP7, thereby adding to the definition of HAUSP. Additionally, our data showed that deletion of the binding domain in EBNA1 for both USP7 and CYPA resulted in significantly increased EBNA1-oriP binding activity (Figure 6C) , mainly due to release of USP7 inhibition. The result was consistent with that of previous report (Holowaty et al., 2003a) , demonstrating that the suppressive role of USP7 was strong enough to greatly overshadow the improved role of CYPA.",
