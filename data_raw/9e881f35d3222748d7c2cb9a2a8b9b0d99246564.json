Various porcine pathogens target macrophages, which are classical innate immune cells.

Therefore, cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens. However, the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited. In this study, we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage (IPKM) cell line, which was generated by transferring the SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase (pTERT) genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors. The IPKM displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged (doubling time: about 4 days). These cells were immunostained for macrophage markers. In addition, they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1\u03b2 were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in LPS-primed IPKM. These findings suggest that IPKM exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages. By transferring the SV40LT and pTERT genes using lentiviral vectors, we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig. These results suggest that the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages.",

The PED virus, a coronavirus, is the causative agent of PED and infects macrophages and disrupts their functions (4).

The culture medium was replaced every 3-4 days. After around 14 days, a sheet-like mixed cell monolayer formed, and macrophage-like cells began to actively proliferate on the cell sheet. The proliferating cells were loosely attached to the cell sheet and so were harvested from the culture supernatant by centrifugation (1,500 rpm for 5 min). Since the macrophages readily attached to non-tissue culture grade plastic dishes, they were selectively isolated from the other types of cells on the basis of this feature (13) .",

Based on the findings of a previous study (9) , primary PKM were transfected with the pSV3-neo plasmid (ATCC Number: 37150) using the Lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or FuGENE HD (Promega) transfection reagent. However, we were unable to obtain an immortalized cell line that retained the characteristics of macrophages from these transfected cells. This was probably because the primary PKM were sensitive to the toxic effects of these transfection reagents. Thus, we decided to use lentiviral vectors to transfer immortalizing genes into the primary PKM. Initially, the cells were infected with lentiviral particles carrying the gene for SV40LT. However, no immortalized cells were generated from the SV40LT-transfected PKM. Next, the cells were transfected with lentiviral particles carrying the SV40LT gene in combination with lentiviral particles carrying the pTERT gene. After several weeks of culturing, proliferative cells appeared in the plastic dishes and were routinely passaged. The expression of both SV40LT and pTERT mRNA was detected in these cells by Q-PCR analyses (data not shown), suggesting that the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT was effective at immortalizing the primary PKM. Thus, we successfully produced an IPKM cell line.",

Cells exhibiting pHrodo-derived fluorescence appeared after around 30 min incubation, and the number of these cells gradually increased in a time-dependent manner (Video S1 in Supplementary Material). pHrodo-labeled E. coli BioParticles that had been incorporated into IPKM displayed very bright fluorescence after 4 h incubation (Figures 3B,C) , indicating that the phagosomes containing the BioParticles matured into phagolysosomes by fusing with lysosomes, which caused them to become more acidic.

As was found for the primary PKM, the IPKM secreted substantial amounts of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, after being stimulated with LPS for 24 h (Figure 4 , upper and middle panels). In contrast, although the primary PKM secreted a substantial amount of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 upon LPS stimulation, the IPKM failed to secrete measurable amounts of IL-10 (Figure 4, lower panel) . These findings suggest that the IPKM primarily displayed the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in response to bacterial endotoxins (20) . Further studies using various stimuli are required to determine whether IPKM can exhibit the antiinflammatory M2 phenotype. ",

            "text": "Inflammasomes are large intracellular multiprotein complexes that function during inflammatory immune responses (21) . The activation of inflammasomes triggers caspase-1 activation followed by the maturation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages. To verify the functional expression of the inflammasome system in IPKM, we assessed the effects of nigericin on the production and secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 in these cells. Nigericin is a potassium ionophore and is recognized as an activator of NLRP3 inflammasomes in humans and rodents (22) . Nigericin triggered the production and secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 in the IPKM in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5A ). This suggests that IPKM are useful for studying the porcine NLRP3 inflammasome system. Extracellular ATP is also known to be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and the P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated cation channel, plays a critical role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by ATP (23) . In contrast to rodent macrophages, it has previously been demonstrated that the ATP/ P2X7R pathway is impaired in primary PKM (12) . Therefore, the effects of extracellular ATP on inflammasome activation were assessed in IPKM. As expected, extracellular ATP (in the millimolar range) failed to induce the production or secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 in IPKM, as was observed in the primary PKM ( Figure 5B) . This supports the notion that the IPKM originated from porcine macrophages and did not arise due to the contamination of the mouse macrophage cell line that was previously established in our laboratory (12, 17) .",

When LDLR-KO pig blood-derived macrophages were infected with lentiviral particles carrying the SV40LT gene in combination with lentiviral particles carrying the pTERT gene, immortalized cells were generated and routinely passaged. The morphology of the immortalized cells closely resembled those of the IPKM and primary macrophages; i.e., they have ruffled membranes and cell processes ( Figure 6A) . The presence of the targeted genomic locus in the immortalized cells was clearly shown by PCR ( Figure 6B) . As was found for the IPKM, immunostaining demonstrated that the immortalized cells were strongly positive for macrophage markers, but negative for other cell markers (Figure 6C) . These findings suggest that inducing the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages.",
