S is a quantity defined as S = a 2 + c 2 + g 2 + t 2 , where a, c, g and t denote corresponding base frequencies. The Z-curve is a three dimensional curve that represents a DNA sequence in the manner that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. Elhaik et al. made 4 major claims. 1) In the previous mapping system with the regular tetrahedron, calculation of the radius of the inscribed sphere is \"a mathematical error\". 2) S follows an exponential distribution and is narrowly distributed with a range of (0.25 -0.33). 3) Based on the Chargaff's second parity rule (PR2), \"S is equivalent to H [Shannon entropy]\" and they are derivable from each other. 4) Z-curve \"suffers from over dimensionality\", because based on the analysis of 235 bacterial genomes, x and y components contributed only less than 1% of the variance and therefore \"would be of little use\".",

Conclusion: Elhaik et al. confuse S (a single number) with Z-curve (a series of 3D coordinates), which are distinct. To use S as a case study of Z-curve, by itself, is invalid. S and H are neither equivalent nor derivable from each other. The criticisms of Elhaik, Graur and Josic are wrong.",

In 2004, we calculated S values for genome sequences, and found that S < 1/3 is valid for most genomes [2] . In 2008, Elhaik et al. criticized this work with 2 claims [3] . 1. S <S 1/3 is in fact a mathematical property that is always true regardless of specific data. 2. S and H (Shannon entropy) are strictly equivalent. To rebut with minimum space, I raised one counterexample to each claim [4] . 1 . When a = c = 0.5, g = t = 0, S = 0.5, which is larger than 1/3; thus S < 1/3 is not a mathematical property that is always true, and it depends on specific data to be valid. 2. H, but not S, has the property of additivity of information entropy; they thus differ. Therefore, both claims are incorrect [4] .",

Based on the correct radius, in contrast to their conclusion that 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere, none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere and none has an S value larger than 1/3.

It is instructive to know that according to PR2 in single-stranded DNA, a and t (or c and g) are equal approximately, but it can never be assumed that these base compositions are exactly the same. In fact, deviations of PR2, which result from both mutation and selection pressures, reflecting biases in, for instance, DNA replication, transcription and repair, have been an important subject of study in the past decades [9] . Therefore, the \"=\" signs in their equations A1 and A2 are still invalid. For instance, for the genome of Elhaik et al. wrote \"We note that the relation between S and H [...] may not hold for DNA sequences that violate the second parity rule, such as organellar DNA and single stranded DNA sequences. However, even these genomes obey a less stringent rule: that the number of a + g's approximately equals the number of t + c's\". Here, two issues need clarification. First, not only in organellar DNA and single stranded DNA sequences, in other genomes, also, the compositions a + g and t + c are only equal approximately. Second, for those genomes that obey a more \"stringent\" PR2 rule, these compositions are still only equal approximately, but can never be assumed as exactly the same. Deviations from PR2, although small, contain critical and rich information, and these deviations differ among genomes, and they thus should not be simply disregarded and treated as 0 altogether, i.e., for genomes, S and H still should not be treated as functions of the composition of one single nucleotide A only (eq. A3 and A5 in [5] ). Therefore, for genomes their demonstration is still invalid.",

As mentioned above, based on x and y components, a large number of replication origins have been located in both bacterial [12, 13] and archaeal genomes [14] .

Clearly, since f_a + f_c + f_g + f_t = 1, we necessarily have that S lies in the range [0. 25, 1] . Both this author and Elhaik et al. seem to agree that, for a large collection of bacterial genomes, we find S < 1/3 but there is disagreement about how 'surprising' this is and what kind of constraint that this is indicative of. First of all, it is clear that for uniformly random sequences the frequencies f_x will be close to 0.25 and thus S will be close to 0.25 as wll. Only for extremely biased base compositions would one get values of S close to 1 and so, in my opinion, it is not 'surprising' at all that there that one does not find genomes with large S values.

The dispute here seems to mostly be of a semantic nature, i.e. regarding the meaning of the word 'equivalent'. I can only see two relevant points: 1) For large DNA sequences (like whole genomes) it is observed that there is an approximate symmetry between the two DNA strands, i.e. the base composition in one strand is not significantly different from the base composition in the other strand. Since, by Watson-Crick base-pairing rules, we only have C-G/G-C and A-T/T-A pairs, this implies that APPROXIMATELY f_a = f_t and f_c = f_g (*) Now, if we assume that the equalities (*) hold exactly, then we have three constraints f_a+f_c+f_g+f_t = 1 f_a = f_t f_c = f_g and so we effectively have only 1 degree of freedom left (which is essentially GC-content). Since both S and H are invertible functions of the remaining degree of freedom, it immediately follows that S can be calculated from H and H from S. Whether you want to call this equivalent or not is a matter of semantics. The point is that when all three constrains are acting, there is only one degree of freedom left. Instead of calculating S or H, I think it would be much more straight-forward to just talk about GC-content directly. Indeed, it is remarkable that CG-content ranges from as low as 0.22 to as high as 0.77 and the relevant biological question, in my opinion, is not whether to use S or H or whatever other derived statistic, but rather trying to explain why GCcontent varies so much in bacterial genomes. Indeed there has been quite some interesting developments in this area recently. See for example the discussion in: Rocha EP, Feil EJ. Mutational patterns cannot explain genome composition: are there any neutral sites in the genomes of bacteria? PLoS Genet. 2010 Sep 9;6(9).",

Thus, I agree with Elhaik et al. that the variation of S and H across different genomes is dominated by the variation in GC-content.",

The author asserts in several places that, indeed, these deviations are highly meaningful but frustratingly fails to give citations to back this claim up. My own recollection is that in bacteria the G/ C-skew has been proposed to be a result of different mutational spectra acting on the leading and lagging strands (and would thus not necessarily have functional implications).",

For example, as we and others have found the presence of ribosomal binding sites plus the avoidance of RNA secondary structure around the translation start site leads to clear base-compositional biases around the starts of genes (Eyre-Walker and Bulmer Nucl. Acids Res 1993, Molina & van Nimwegen Genome Res 2008). However, this seems to now confound the question of local compositional biases and their functional implications versus global patterns of base composition, because as far as I can tell Elhaik et al. were talking about global compositional patterns.",

Regarding the questions such as whether the calculation of the inscribed sphere radius is 'a mathematical error', and whether Z-curve suffers from 'over dimensionality', there is only one answer: yes or no. Science literatures and readers deserve the truth. Second, in contrast, whether a topic is surprising or useful is largely a personal opinion.
