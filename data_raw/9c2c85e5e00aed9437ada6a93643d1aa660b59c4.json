A total of 2,738 malaria cases were identified in Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2014, of which 2,018 were male and 720 were female. Notably, only 7% of malaria cases were indigenous and the other cases were all imported. The number of malaria cases increased from 2005 to 2007, peaked in 2007, and then decreased from 2007 to 2011. There were no indigenous cases from 2012 to 2014. Of all cases, 68% of cases contracted Plasmodium vivax, 27% of cases contracted P. falciparum, and two cases contracted P. malariae. About 88% of malaria cases during 2005-2011 occurred yearly between May and October, but the number of malaria cases in different months during 2012-2014 was similar. The median age was 33 years, and 1,892 cases occurred in persons aged 20-50 years. The proportion of businessmen increased and the proportion of migrant laborers decreased in recent years. The median time from illness onset to confirmation of malaria cases was 5 days and it decreased from 2005 to 2014. Some epidemiological characteristics of malaria have changed, and businessmen are the emphases to surveillance in every month.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate in 2014, there were 3.2 billion people at risk of being infected with malaria and developing disease; 198 million cases of malaria and 584,000 deaths occurred globally in 2013. 1 Over the span of the last century, almost half of the world's countries have successfully eliminated malaria. 2 Although great success has been achieved since the launch of national malaria control program in 1955, malaria remains a serious public health problem in China. [3] [4] [5] The Chinese Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NDRS), which was initiated in the 1950s, is the fundamental communicable disease surveillance system in China. After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Chinese government strengthened the construction of public health information system. On January 1, 2004, the Real-Time Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System was put into use nationwide, realizing the timely online monitoring of individual cases, which marks a leap in the surveillance of communicable diseases in China.",

According to the plan, many departments collaborated with each other to eliminate malaria in Zhejiang Province and comprehensive measures were conducted. First, the control and management of infection source were enhanced. Screening of malaria among patients with high fever was conducted in province, city, county, and town levels medical institutions. Cases were reported, treated, and managed soon after the confirmation. Second, control and prevention of mosquito were enhanced. The patriotic public health campaign was carried and breeding places of mosquito were removed. Moreover, residual spray was used to reduce density of mosquito and bed nets were used to prevent mosquito bites. Third, health education was enhanced through newspapers, TV, radio, and Internet.

Finally, prevention and control of malaria among immigrants was enhanced. Entry-exit departments was in charge of screening of malaria cases among fever patients and the information on patients were reported to medical departments. Public security departments helped to trace malaria patients among immigrants. Nevertheless, mosquito density was high in malaria areas and businessmen were inevitably bit by mosquito. As a result, decades of malaria cases were imported in Zhejiang Province. This informed that elimination of malaria in endemic areas would contribute to the reduction of imported cases in nonendemic areas.",

The reasons might be that the majority of cases were imported and most of the imported cases came from Africa. If the majority of the cases were domestic, there might be more vivax cases. Furthermore, misdiagnosis might exist because of poor diagnostic capacity of county-level centers for diseases control and prevention. We noted that the majority of cases were P. vivax infection, which was similar to studies from Qatar, Kuwait, Kingdom of Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. [11] [12] [13] [14] Although P. vivax malaria is commonly considered nonsevere and has been historically termed as \"benign tertian malaria,\" new published studies showed that cases of P. vivax infection often resulted in increased hospitalizations, severe disease, and death than previously expected. 14-17 These informed us that P. vivax malaria was the greatest cause of malaria morbidity in Zhejiang Province.",

Therefore, people had more chances to be bitten by mosquito, increasing the number of malaria cases.

The growth of rice in these cites provided breeding places for Anopheles sinensis, which increased the transmission probability of malaria in these areas. Some areas of these five cities were infection focus of malaria in the past. Furthermore, the number of imported cases was relative to the frequency of travel and trade to malaria-endemic areas.

Some epidemiological characteristics of malaria changed in recent years, the risk of imported malaria was similar among different months, and the businessmen accounted for the highest proportion. These results informed that imported cases were the emphases for the control and prevention of malaria, and measures should be taken in all months in Zhejiang Province. Measures to better intercept imported cases should include health education and preventive medication among travelers to malaria-endemic areas, the screening of malaria among travelers with high fever, and collaborating with the neighboring countries. In addition, other comprehensive measures, such as early case detection and prompt treatment, residual spraying, usage of bed nets, environmental and antilarval management, and monitoring of drug resistance, should also be conducted to achieve the elimination of malaria in Zhejiang Province. 2  The origins of imported cases from 2010 to 2014   2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  Total   Africa  Nigeria  10  19  13  33  49  124  Ghana  3  4  14  41  13  75  Equatorial Guinea  2  1 2  2 3  2 2  1 9  7 8  Angola  14  15  9  18  20  76  Congo  2  10  5  12  15  44  Cameron  2  6  1  11  23  43  Guinea  1  5  2  3  4  1 5  Uganda  4  2  2  3  2  1 3  Gabon  1  0  4 This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",
