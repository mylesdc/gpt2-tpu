            "text": "Mitochondria-as well as p53-based signaling pathways are central for the execution of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Their contribution to rubella virus (RV)-induced apoptosis was addressed through time-specific evaluation of characteristic parameters such as permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of the pro-apoptotic proteins apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Additionally, expression and localization pattern of p53 and selected members of the multifunctional and stress-inducible cyclophilin family were examined. The application of pifithrin \u00b5 as an inhibitor of p53 shuttling to mitochondria reduced RV-induced cell death to an extent similar to that of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-V-A-D-(OMe)-fmk). However, RV progeny generation was not altered. This indicates that, despite an increased survival rate of its cellular host, induction of apoptosis neither supports nor restricts RV replication. Moreover, some of the examined apoptotic markers were affected in a strain-specific manner and differed between the cell culture-adapted strains: Therien and the HPV77 vaccine on the one hand, and a clinical isolate on the other. In summary, the results presented indicate that the transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 program contributes to RV-induced apoptosis.",

Additionally, prolonged survival of RV-infected cells is ensured by the induction of the phosphatidylinositol 3 I -kinase (PI3K)/AKT survival pathway [6] and by anti-apoptotic activities of the viral C protein [7, 8] . These viral infection-promoting activities of the C protein involve its localization to mitochondria and its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and the mitochondrial matrix protein p32 (gC1qR), [7, 9] . The p32 protein is required for viral replication [10] and for transport of mitochondria to viral replication complexes [11] . In addition to its interaction with mitochondrial proteins, RV infection has an impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic function [11, 12] .",

            "text": "Due to the interdependency of apoptotic and metabolic pathways [13], the mitochondria-based signaling platform might contribute to RV-associated programmed cell death. The intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway can be induced by cytotoxic stress during ongoing viral replication and is usually accompanied by permeabilization of the inner (IMM) and/or outer (OMM) mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial permeabilization is characterized by formation of \"death decision pores\", such as ceramide lipid pores; the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC) formed in response to OMM permeabilization (MOMP); and the relatively large mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which originates at the IMM [14] . MOMP and subsequently MAC formation can result from oligomerization of Bcl-2 family members such as Bax and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak). Through the formation of these death decision pores, mitochondrial function is lost and the apoptotic cascade is further fueled, as metabolites, small ions and apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c (Cytc), Smac/Diablo, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and/or endonuclease G (Endo G) are released. The coordination of these processes involves the tumor-suppressor protein p53, which executes its function through both a transcription-dependent (nuclear) and transcription-independent (mitochondrial) pathway. The former influences the mRNA level of pro-and anti-apoptotic factors and the latter involves direct regulation of protein functions at mitochondria, e.g., activation of the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins [15] . Additionally, p53 might also interact directly with mitochondria and induce MOMP by itself [16] .",

The multifunctional cyclophilins as proteins of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family are highly conserved molecular chaperons that support protein folding and isomerization and thus participate in the cellular stress response [17] . To study the contribution of apoptosis-promoting parameters to RV-associated cellular aberrations, selected pharmacological compounds were applied to RV-infected cells. Presented data point to a contribution of mitochondrial translocation of p53, partial opening of the mPTP and nuclear shuttling of AIF and cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40) to RV-induced apoptosis, which occurs at least partly in a strain-specific manner.",

Application of z-VAD-fmk was excluded from the analysis as it is a well-characterized inhibitor of apoptosis. Figure 1C shows a clear laddering of oligonucleosomal fragments and indicates that floaters possess DNA fragmentation irrespective to the application of pharmacological compounds. Figure 1D indicates that with 72 h post-infection only at late time points of infection the activity of caspase 3 and 7 as executioner caspases was detectable at a significant level in RV-infected cells. Hence, this time point was used for studying the effect of NIM811, z-VAD-fmk and PFT\u00b5 on RV-induced apoptotic signaling pathways. Figure 1E shows conventional annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/propidium iodide (PI) staining and indicates that in comparison to the SC, the number of PI-and annexin V-EGFP-positive cells was reduced after application of z-VAD-fmk and to a lesser extent after treatment with PFT\u00b5, but not after addition of NIM811. To extend this observation, activity of caspase 3 and 7 was determined after application of PFT\u00b5 and z-VAD-fmk. Figure 1F depicts the reduction in active caspase 3 and 7 which as expected was profound after application of z-VAD-fmk. In comparison to the SC, PFT\u00b5 also reduces the amount of active caspase 3 and 7, but not as effective as z-VAD-fmk ( Figure 1F ). Taken together, PFT\u00b5 appears to target one of the key players during RV-induced cell death.",

In the case of RV-infected Vero cells (3 dpi), a minor but distinct portion of cells appear to have lost CytC from their mitochondria ( Figure 4A ). To further validate this observation, selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin was performed. First, the lowest possible concentration of digitonin was determined, which gives a detectable fluorescence signal for a cytoplasmic protein, in this case alpha-tubulin. As a positive control, Figure 4B ,C illustrate the signal for the cytoplasmic protein alpha-tubulin and the mitochondrial protein CytC after 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation and permeabilization with methanol. Figure 4B highlights that permeabilization with digitonin at 25 \u00b5g/mL after 2% (w/v) PFA fixation gives a sufficient signal for alpha-tubulin after application of its respective antibody. However, a remarkable signal loss occurs after application of digitonin at 1 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 4B ). Hence, digitonin was applied at 25 \u00b5g/mL to verify CytC localization outside of mitochondria. As shown in Figure 4C , no CytC signal can be detected in mock-treated cells. However, overnight incubation with 0.003% H 2 O 2 produces a distinct CytC signal in the cytoplasm, which was also detectable for RV-infected cells (3 dpi). In summary, single cells within the RV-infected population were positive for CytC-signals in the cytoplasm, outside of mitochondria.",

Western blot analysis of nuclear fractions confirmed the increased nuclear localization of p53 after application of PFT\u00b5 ( Figure 5C ). Additionally, and in contrast to the mock-infected population, Western blot analysis of mitochondria-enriched fractions from the RV-infected, SC-treated Vero cell population showed an increased band intensity for p53 which was reduced after application of PFT\u00b5 ( Figure 5D ). Application of NIM811 had no detectable effect on the level of p53 within the mitochondria-enriched fraction. Subsequently immunofluorescence analysis of the intracellular distribution of p53 and the mitochondria-associated viral C protein revealed punctate staining of p53 outside of the nucleus, close to C protein-positive areas ( Figure 5E ). These areas overlap with an area of clustered mitochondria typical for RV-infected Vero cells, which have a highly intense MitoTracker DeepRed CMX Ros staining ( Figure 5E , shown in white).

Immunofluorescence analysis was performed after permeabilization with two different detergents. Triton X-100 partially dissolves the nuclear membrane, while Tween 20 enables staining of mainly cytoplasmic proteins. Figure 7A highlights that after permeabilization with Tween 20, hardly any differences between mock-and RV-infected Vero cells and Vero cells after overnight incubation with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide are noticeable. This is in contrast to permeabilization with Triton X-100, which shows a clear shift of CypA from a cytoplasmic to a nuclear localization ( Figure 7B(12) ). However, as compared to the mock-infected control, only a slight shift of CypA to the nucleus can be speculated after infection with RV ( Figure 7B (4) and 7B (8)). In conclusion, during RV infection, nuclear translocation of Cyp40, but not of CypA, is detectable. Figure 7 . Impact of RV infection on intracellular distribution of cyclophilin A. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed with anti-CypA antibody (shown in red) and anti-E1 antibody (shown in green) for RV-and mock-infected Vero cells (3 dpi). Nuclear DNA is shown in blue.

Nevertheless, there are also cases in which cyclophilins restrict viral replication [24] . No cellular functions that are vital for RV replication were affected by the application of NIM811 as reflected by the maintained virus production rate. It is important to note that RV specifically affects the expression pattern of the ubiquitous protein Cyp40 that acts as co-chaperone of the Hsp90/Hsp70 complex and guides its interaction with other proteins, including those involved in antiviral host response [30] . Cyp40 is occasionally referred to as CypD, which contributes to some unresolved issues in its physiological functions. Its participation in protein maturation pathways [17] , especially its nuclear localization after stress induction by UVA treatment [31] , heat stress [32] , or RV infection as shown here, certainly warrants further exploration and points to a multitude of physiological functions. Especially heat stress parallels some of the effects exerted by RV on its host cell, including Cyp40 nuclear redistribution and an increase in the Cyp40 mRNA level [32] .

In comparison to the Therien and HPV77 strains, the clinical isolate Wb-12 induced a stronger signal of nuclear p53. This suggests that during cell-culture adaptation RV strains have evolved mechanisms to counteract or to avoid nuclear localization of p53. The application of PFT\u00b5 appears to support the previously published anti-apoptotic activity of Therien, which is also reflected by the association of its C protein with Bax [7] . The present paper ties in with this reported involvement of a mitochondrial signaling pathway in RV-infected A549 cells and subsequently viral strategies to counteract cellular death mechanisms. Additionally, application of PFT\u00b5 to RV-infected Vero cells increases p53 nuclear expression during RV infection, highlighting that blocking one branch of p53 activity favors the other. However, Therien appears not to be affected by the PFT\u00b5-associated increase in nuclear p53 localization, as PFT\u00b5 reduces CPE.",

Nevertheless, there are also cases in which cyclophilins restrict viral replication [24] . No cellular functions that are vital for RV replication were affected by the application of NIM811 as reflected by the maintained virus production rate. It is important to note that RV specifically affects the expression pattern of the ubiquitous protein Cyp40 that acts as co-chaperone of the Hsp90/Hsp70 complex and guides its interaction with other proteins, including those involved in antiviral host response [30] . Cyp40 is occasionally referred to as CypD, which contributes to some unresolved issues in its physiological functions. Its participation in protein maturation pathways [17] , especially its nuclear localization after stress induction by UVA treatment [31] , heat stress [32] , or RV infection as shown here, certainly warrants further exploration and points to a multitude of physiological functions. Especially heat stress parallels some of the effects exerted by RV on its host cell, including Cyp40 nuclear redistribution and an increase in the Cyp40 mRNA level [32] . Noteworthy in this context is that Hsp90-binding cyclophilins such as Cyp40 are involved in protein trafficking to the nucleus, including p53 [33] .",

Already minor changes can evoke alterations of cellular antiviral activities, as shown in this paper by the increase in p53 nuclear expression after inhibiting mitochondrial shuttling of p53 with PFT\u00b5. CPE induction after RV infection is only observed after infection of susceptible cell lines such as Vero and RK13 [2] . It is especially noteworthy that RV-induced apoptosis is detectable in human primary differentiated, nonproliferative cells, but not in proliferative fetal cells [43] . This strengthens the cellular context dependency of RV-associated apoptotic processes, which might be due to differences in cellular signaling pathways or to differences in the anti-viral response provoked by RV in these cell lines. The identification of cellular factors specific for RV-induced cell death as outlined in this study will help to address and delineate this cell line-dependency as identified factors can be specifically examined in their cellular context. Clinical isolates can be regarded as a tool for identification of viral and cellular components that contribute to RV cell-culture adaptation. Future experiments will be aimed at elucidating the interplay of RV strains with nuclear and extranuclear p53 pools and how a virus coordinates cellular functions to its own advantage.",

After centrifugation at 16,000\u00a2 g at 4 \u00a5 C the supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet was washed with ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol and dissolved in 40 \u00b5L ddH2O. The DNA was analyzed by 1.5% standard agarose gel electrophoresis at 60 V for 30-60 min.",

Viable cells are not permeable for PI (5 \u00b5M), while induction of apoptosis leads to binding of annexin V due to exposure of phosphatidylserine. Activity of caspase 3 and 7 was determined using the CellEvent caspase-3/7 ReadyProbes reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Braunschweig, Gemany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Caspase-3/7 activity was determined by microscopic analysis of the fluorescent events after cleavage of the non-fluorescent DEVD peptide. As a DNA counterstain, cells were stained with Hoechst bisbenzimide 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Braunschweig, Gemany), (2 \u00b5M). Samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a FITC/TRITC filter. 4.6. Calcein Release Assay for Assessment of Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (mPTP) Opening mPTP opening was assessed with the MitoProbe transition pore opening kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Technologies). Mitochondrial calcein is lost after the opening of the mPTP. Hence, the mPTP opening was assessed through evaluation of the mitochondrial fluorescence signal of calcein after the quenching of its cytosolic portion with CoCl 2 . Briefly, medium was replaced with warm Hank's balanced salt solution containing calcium (HBSS/Ca) and loaded with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM at 1.0 \u00b5M) and CoCl 2 (1.0 mM). After an incubation of 3 h at 37 \u00a5 C, cells were washed with HBSS and directly processed to fluorescence microscopic analysis. Opening of mPTP was induced through overnight incubation with H 2 O 2 (0.003%).",

The transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 function can be blocked by PFT\u00b5. p53 can interact with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to induce its oligomerization and formation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC). The release of pro-apoptotic CytC promotes the formation of the so-called apoptosome consisting of apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf-1), pro-caspase 9 and CytC. Effector caspases can be inhibited by the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Application of NIM811 can inhibit cyclophilins such as CypD and Cyp40 as examined in this study.
