Although human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) are the natural host for HRV infections, much of our understanding of how HRV replicates and induces host antiviral responses is based on studies using non-airway cell lines (e.g. HeLa cells). The current study examines the replication cycle of HRV, and host cell responses, in highly differentiated cultures of HBE. Methods: Highly differentiated cultures of HBE were exposed to initial infectious doses ranging from 10 4 to 10 1 50% tissue culture-infective dose (TCID 50 ) of purified HRV-16, and responses were monitored up to 144 h after infection. Viral genomic RNA and negative strand RNA template levels were monitored, along with levels of type I and II interferons and selected antivirals.",

            "text": "Results: Regardless of initial infectious dose, relatively constant levels of both genomic and negative strand RNA are generated during replication, with negative strand copy numbers being10,000-fold lower than those of genomic strands. Infections were limited to a small percentage of ciliated cells and did not result in any overt signs of epithelial death. Importantly, regardless of infectious dose, HRV-16 infections were cleared by HBE in the absence of immune cells. Levels of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) varied with initial infectious dose, implying that factors other than levels of double-stranded RNA regulate IFN induction, but the time-course of HRV-16 clearance HBE was the same regardless of levels of IFNs produced. Patterns of antiviral viperin and ISG15 expression suggest they may be generated in an IFN-independent manner during HRV-16 infections. Conclusions: These data challenge a number of aspects of dogma generated from studies in HeLa cells and emphasize the importance of appropriate cell context when studying HRV infections.",

HRV replication requires virus entry into cells and genome release [11] . The viral polyprotein is then translated from the positive sense RNA genome and the viral RNA polymerase subsequently generates negative strand copies of the HRV genome. These negative strands serve as templates for replication of positive strand genomes for packaging in the virus capsid [12] . Thus, during RV replication, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated which, according to dogma, not only regulates levels of viral replication but also is recognized by pattern recognition receptors that mediate the induction of proinflammatory and antiviral responses [13] . Viral release from infected cells then occurs via cell lysis [12] . Although it is generally held that innate immunity plays a key role in regulating the outcome to HRV infections, it is thought that immune cells also play an important role in viral clearance [14] .",

We show that, contrary to existing dogma, HBE clear HRV infections without the need for immune cells. In addition, we observed that levels of dRNA, assessed by quantification of negative strand template RNA, correlate temporally and quantitatively with maximal intracellular viral genome loads. In marked contrast, maximal levels of type I and type III interferon (IFN)s, as well as of some other host defense molecules, are not related to peak negative strand template levels but, rather, vary depending on the initial infectious dose of HRV used.",

Instead, levels of IFN mRNA declined with the initial infectious dose of HRV-16 used. Levels of secreted IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03b2 proteins, which were released dominantly at the apical surface, showed a similar pattern, although, depending on infectious dose of HRV, peak protein secretion occurred later than maximal mRNA levels (Fig. 6 ). Because levels of negative strand were already maximal at 24 h following infection with 10 4 TCID 50 of HRV-16, we performed separate experiments over periods up to 24 h after infection with this dose of HRV-16. Negative strand template was detectable by 8 h after infection and increased to peak levels at 24 h (Fig. 7) , Interestingly, increased expression of IFN-\u03bb1 mRNA was not observed until 24 h, when it was already comparable to the maximal level observed in Fig. 6 .",

At the highest initial infectious dose (10 4 TCID 50 of HRV-16), peak expression of both viperin and ISG15 was slightly delayed relative to those of IFNs and CXCL10. Moreover, the dependence on infectious dose was less clear, as comparable viperin expression was observed at all initial infectious doses (except 10 4 TCID 50 of HRV-16), and the reduction of ISG15 expression at lower doses was less marked.

The physiological relevance of such studies of HRV replication must be questioned, however, since HRV selectively infects the airways. HRV infection studies in vivo demonstrate that epithelial cells are the natural site of HRV infection and replication [5, 6, 21] , and the use of human airway epithelial cell lines [22] , and subsequently primary HBE grown in submersion culture [23, 24] , or at ALI [25, 26] , have provided important insights into the inflammatory and innate immune responses to HRV infection.

For each initial infectious dose of HRV-16, copy number of negative stand template is shown relative to levels of IFN-\u03bb1 (blue) or IFN-\u03b2 (red). Left panels show IFN mRNA and right panels show apically secreted protein levels. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM from 4 different HBE donors submersion culture are not suited, however, for studying the complete HRV replication cycle, as confluent cultures cannot be maintained for extended periods. Initially, ALI cultures of HBE used cells grown in \"bronchial epithelial differentiation medium\" for 3 weeks yielded cultures that were multi-layered and expressed some cilia but did not reproduce the in vivo pseudostratified columnar morphology [25, 26] . By contrast, 5week ALI cultures grown in PneumaCult medium recapitulate in vivo morphology. Moreover, these cultures can be maintained for months at ALI, permitting the current studies examining the HRV replication cycle in response to varying initial infectious doses of HRV. Although well differentiated cultures of human airway epithelial cells have been used to study kinetic responses to infection with respiratory syncytial virus [27, 28] , to our knowledge this is the first use of such cells for extended kinetic studies of responses to HRV infection.",

Given that the initial infectious material removed from the cells contains levels of HRV that are not distinguishable from the dose applied (not shown), it would appear that few virions are taken up by cells. Thus, it is unclear why a delay in replication is observed with lower doses. One could speculate that fewer cells are initially infected with lower doses and that it takes longer for all cells that can support replication to be infected. Regardless, a major observation from the current studies is that highly differentiated HBE can clear HRV-16 infection by 144 h after infection, regardless of the initial infectious dose used. This is reflected both by intracellular and shed virus levels. It should be noted that the general time course of shed virus in these cultures resembles that observed in nasal secretions following experimental HRV-16 infection of normal volunteers [17] . Overall, these data indicate that epithelial antiviral responses on their own are adequate to clear HRV-16 infections and that, while recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells to the airway mucosa in vivo may contribute to symptoms, these cells are not essential for virus clearance.",

            "text": "To our knowledge there has been no prior quantitative assessment of the level of dsRNA achieved in airway epithelial cells infected with HRV. We examined absolute copy numbers of negative strand as a means to quantify dsRNA. Prior studies of single strand genome viruses have shown that conventional RT-PCR targeting the negative strand does not provide strand-specificity. The phenomenon of \"false priming\" yields signals even in the absence of primer during reverse transcription [34, 35] , and studies using single strands generated by in vitro transcription from plasmids have shown that RT-PCR for negative strand is not specific in the presence of excess positive strand [36] . We therefore modified a previously published strategy [36] , in which the primer for reverse transcription contains a non-viral sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the specific sequence targeting the negative strand of HRV-16. This non-viral sequence is then used as a primer to selectively amplify the negative strand specific cDNA at the PCR stage. This technique showed that similar levels of negative strand (and, thus, presumably, dsRNA) were achieved regardless of the initial infectious dose, albeit with varying time-courses. This implies that a defined level of negative strand is required for optimal replication of genomic RNA. If the concept put forward for poliovirus that genomes that have not been translated cannot function as templates for negative strand synthesis [37, 38] also holds true for HRV, this would suggest that a defined level of virus Fig. 8 Relationship between copy number of negative strand template (taken from Fig. 5 ) and mRNA or protein for CXCL10. For each initial infectious dose of HRV-16, copy number of negative stand template is shown relative to levels of CXCL10 mRNA (left panels) mRNA or basolateral protein release (right panels). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM from 4 different HBE donors polyprotein strands are translated after infection in order to support optimal viral replication. Given that copy numbers of negative strand were about 10,000-fold lower than those of positive strand, transcription of positive strand from template must be highly efficient. Our data differ from a previous report of a ratio of only about 70 positive strands per negative strand in cells infected with poliovirus, assessed using an RNase protection assay [39] . This difference may be due to specificity of the natural cell host (the cell type used in the prior poliovirus study was never defined), differences between viruses, or the sensitivity and specificity of the methods used.",

Studies have reported varying roles of the dsRNA receptors, toll-like receptor-3, retinoic acid inducible gene-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 in inducing epithelial responses to HRV infection [19, 40, 41] . Type I and type III IFNs are both produced by epithelial cells in response to viral infections but recent studies have indicated that type III IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03bb1, are the dominant IFNs produced by human airway epithelial cells in response to HRV infection [10, 42] . We confirmed this observation in highly differentiated epithelial cells, showing that induction of mRNA and protein for IFN-\u03bb1 are considerably higher than levels observed for IFN-\u03b2. Interestingly, however, despite the relatively constant level of negative strand template generated with each initial infectious dose of HRV-16, levels of mRNA and protein for type I and type III IFNs decreased markedly as the initial infectious dose of HRV decreased. Interestingly, levels of IFNs produced had no bearing on the time to HRV clearance, implying that neither of these types of IFNs control viral clearance. No IFNs were generated in cells exposed to HRV rendered replication deficient by exposure to UV light (not shown). Since HRV treated in this way can still engage its receptor, this implies that induction of IFNs requires viral replication and not just engagement of ICAM-1, the receptor for HRV-16. For each infectious dose of HRV-16, the kinetics, but not the quantity, of IFN induction mirrored that of negative strand template. Thus, the degree of induction of IFNs is not simply regulated by levels of dsRNA, as reflected by levels of negative strand. This implies that other factors Fig. 9 Relationship between copy number of negative strand template (taken from Fig. 5 ) and mRNA for viperin. For each initial infectious dose of HRV-16, copy number of negative stand template is shown relative to levels of viperin mRNA Data are mean \u00b1 SEM from 4 different HBE donors generated during the replication cycle must play a role. The identity of these factors is unknown but singlestranded RNA, other replications intermediates, or other components of the viral genome, may contribute. Induction of CXCL10 mRNA and protein closely mirrored the induction of IFNs, both in terms of kinetics and quantity. Since we have previously reported that induction of CXCL10 by HRV-16 is not mediated via IFN signaling [17] , it may be that induction of both CXCL10 and IFNs occur via shared pathways. It is of interest that there was a different vectoriality of release for IFNs (mainly apical) and CXCL10 (mainly basolateral). We have also observed this for other epithelial mediators (not shown). At this point the reasons for these differences are unknown.",

Although both viperin and ISG15 are usually referred to as members of the group of \"IFN-stimulated genes\" (ISGs), there is precedent that ISGs can be induced independently of IFNs. Such IFN-independent induction occurs via direct viral induction of key transcription factors, particularly members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Thus, cells deficient in both type I and type III IFN receptors still showed induction of multiple ISGs in response to influenza infection [43] . Similarly, it has previously been show that viperin can be induced independently of IFN signaling via an IRF-1 mediated mechanism [44] . Consistent with this, we have previously shown robust induction of IRF-1 and IRF-7 in HRV-infected human airway epithelial cells [45, 46] , and have demonstrated that induction of ISG15 by HRV is dependent upon transcriptional control by IRF-1 [19] .",

We used HRV-16 because it is representative of a large number of HRV-A strains that also use ICAM-1, and has been commonly used for in vivo experimental infections. Nonetheless, we must avoid generalizing our data to all strains of HRV. Additional studies will be required to determine if HRV-A strains that use the low density lipoprotein as a receptor, or HRV-C strains that require cadherin related family member 3 to gain cell entry [51] , show the same patterns of virus clearance, epithelial integrity, negative strand template expression and antiviral gene expression observed for HRV-16. It will also be of interest to determine if responses to a second consecutive infection, either with the same HRV strain or a different one, will show altered responses.",

These HRV-16 infections are cleared without the need for immune cells, and the time to clearance does not depend on levels of IFNs. Regardless of initial infectious dose used, relatively constant levels of genomic and negative strand RNA are generated, albeit with varying kinetics. Copy numbers of negative-strand RNA are some 10,000-fold lower than numbers of positive (genomic) strands. Although relatively constant levels of negative strands are generated regardless of initial infectious dose, levels of type I and type III IFNs vary depending upon initial infectious dose, implying that factors other than levels of dsRNA regulate IFN induction. Patterns of viperin and ISG15 expression suggest they may be generated in an IFN-independent manner during HRV-16 infections. These data challenge a number of widely held paradigms generated from earlier studies in HeLa cells and emphasize the importance of appropriate cell context when performing experiments using HRV infections.
