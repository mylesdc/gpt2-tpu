Hence we can predict not only whether a putative enzyme in a newly sequenced organism has the potential to perform a certain reaction, but how the reaction is performed, using which cofactors and with susceptibility to which drugs or inhibitors, details with important consequences for drug and enzyme design. Work that predicts enzyme catalytic activity based on 3D protein structure features limits the prediction of mechanism to proteins already having either a solved structure or a close relative suitable for homology modelling.",

A much less researched problem is to predict by which mechanism an enzyme carries out a reaction. Differentiating enzymatic mechanism has important applications not only for biology and medicine, but also for pharmaceutical and industrial processes which include enzymatic catalysis. For example, biological and pharmaceutical research could leverage different mechanisms in host and pathogen for drug design, or to evaluate if antibiotic resistance is likely to appear in certain micro-organisms. And enzymes that perform the same reaction but require less costly cofactors can be more interesting candidates for industrial processes. Predicting the existence of a mechanism of interest in a newly sequenced extremophile, for example, could lead to applications in medicine or industry and to significant cost savings over non-biological industrial synthesis.",

Version 3.0 of the MACiE database contains detailed information about 335 different enzymatic mechanisms. Thanks to this information manually derived from literature, it is possible in MACiE to compare exemplars of enzymes that accept the same substrate and produce the same product, but do so using a different chemical mechanism, intermediate activation step or cofactor.

Multilabel learning also provides flexibility by allowing seamless integration of additional labelling schemes. For example, Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology terms could be predicted together with mechanism. We evaluate the method by training a classifier on enzymes with known mechanisms. The classifier learns from the available attributes (for example sequence signatures) and then attempts to predict the mechanisms of a previously unseen test sequence.

However, past research has proved that the Enzyme Commission class of enzymes can be successfully predicted even for distantly related sequences using exclusively InterPro signatures [7] [8] [9] . Traube et al. [10] used QSAR and enzyme mechanism to predict and design covalent inhibitors for serine and cysteine proteases. Their method, like ours, does not require a solved protein structure, but its mechanism predictions are aimed at drug design and not easily portable to enzymes other than proteases. Choi et al. [11] use sequence to predict the existence and position of probable catalytic sites (grouped and aligned by Enzyme Commission number) with about 25% accuracy (approximately 8% better than random) but their prediction does not specify which mechanism the enzyme might be using in that active site. Other work tried to predict whether an amino acid is catalytic, and could in principle lead towards mechanism identification, but in practice has not been used to infer mechanism, only enzyme reaction. Using 3D structural information, Chea et al. [12] used graph theory to predict whether an amino acid is catalytic, followed by filtering using solvent accessibility and compatibility of residue identity since some amino acids are less likely to be involved in active catalysis. But their output is a binary label (catalytic or not) and not a prediction of mechanism. Using only sequence, Mistry et al. [13] have developed a strict set of rules to transfer experimentally determined active site residues to other Pfam family proteins, achieving a 3% FP rate, 82% specificity and 62% sensitivity. However, again, they do not link the active site residues to the mechanism performed.",

The resulting 126,499 couples are presented in Figure 1 , which provides an overview of the sequence identity and Euclidean distance (in the Inter-Pro attribute space) for each protein couple. As expected, most protein couples have low sequence identity (between 0% and 30%) and Euclidean distance between two and four, that is, have between four and sixteen differences in their InterPro signatures. This area seems to represent a very frequent sequence distance for protein couples with The table presents the number of instances (proteins), attributes (signatures or sequence identity values) and class values (mechanisms) for the datasets used in this work; for the swissprot-non-EC set we present the instances that need prediction (the ones sharing a signature with the mechanism set), while the total number of instances is shown between parentheses. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/150 Figure 1 The sequence identity and Euclidean distance of enzymes with the same and different mechanism.

The colour scale is logarithmic increasing from blue (for one instance) to light blue (2-3 instances), green (4-9), yellow (70-100), orange (250) and red (up to 433 instances) and represents the number of protein couples having that sequence identity and Euclidean distance.

The figure shows how enzymes having different mechanisms (triangle markers) concentrate in the upper left area of the plot, mostly having both low sequence identity (<30%) and high Euclidean distance between their signature sets (1.4 to 6, between 2 and 36 different signatures). In contrast, enzymes having the same mechanism form a long band across the figure, showing an extensive range of sequence identity, from about 18% to 100% but a lower and less varied Euclidean distance (0 to 2.2, that is, from having the same signatures to having 5 different signatures).",

To evaluate this simple form of learning (binary predictions in the form \"same mechanism\" or \"different mechanism\") we used a line passing through the origin and we varied the angle of the line between zero and ninety degrees, recording the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each line. As it is often the case, there is no absolute best line, some maximise precision, others recall. However, to give an example, the line passing Another way to read the equation Euclidean distance = 7 \u00d7 sequence identity is that for two proteins differing in two signatures, at least about 20% sequence identity is necessary for the proteins to have the same mechanism (about 25% sequence identity for three differences, 29% for four differences and so on). In addition, while the equation suggests that proteins having exactly the same signatures can have any level of sequence identity, in practice the sequence identity for couples having the same mechanism never falls below 18% in the data, possibly because two random sequences (of approximately the same length as our sequences) will have a minimum number of identical amino acids by chance alone. The couples having the same mechanism are almost homogeneously scattered above this 18% threshold, but with several couples having about 40% sequence identity and few having very high sequence identity (80% to 100%).

Figure 2 presents an overview of the performance of different set of attributes in predicting the mechanism dataset. As an indicative baseline for prediction we used the labels predicted when mechanism is assigned simply by the presence of a certain set of InterPro domains (Inter-Pro direct transfer). For example, protein ODPB_GEOSE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, P21874) is part of the dataset and has MACiE mechanism M0106 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and InterPro IPR005475, IPR005476, IPR009014 and IPR015941. Hence, if we use direct transfer of mechanism labels, another protein such as ODBB_HUMAN (2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit beta mitochondrial, P21953) which has exactly the same InterPro signatures will receive a M0106 label, thereby introducing an error, since ODBB_HUMAN's mechanism is in fact M0280 (or 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase). If several proteins in the training set have exactly the same InterPro attributes, the given test protein will be assigned all of their mechanism labels. The direct transfer method achieves 99.9% accuracy and 95.7% precision on the mechanism set, but only 76.6% recall. That is, when it assigns a label, it tends to be correct, but about a quarter of the proteins do not find another protein with exactly the same InterPro signatures in the training set, and so do not receive a prediction. The low recall is thus mainly caused by false negatives.",

We use here the negative set, which contains 290 enzymes with known MACiE labels, but impossible to use for cross validation as they have only one protein per label. We thus train on the mechanism set plus the non-enzymes in Swiss-Prot (swissprot-non-EC), to provide training examples for both proteins having and not having the mechanisms of interest and we test on the separate negative set. If the method behaved in an ideal way, all the enzymes in the negative set would be predicted to be without labels, because none of the labels available in the training set is appropriate for the negative enzymes. We also randomly partition the mechanism dataset into two folds (mech-fold1 and mech-fold2). Because many mechanisms in the mechanism set only have two proteins, we could not generate more than two folds without causing a further loss of mechanism labels and proteins. When training on fold 1 (mech-fold1 + half of swissprotnon-EC) and testing on fold 2 (mech-fold2 + the other half of swissprot-non-EC) there are only twelve false positive and twenty-three false negative predictions. Reversing the folds causes only six false positive and twenty-one false negative predictions. Thus even in such a vast test set, the mechanism training set only generates eighteen false positive predictions over more than 220,000 proteins. In addition, many of these false predictions are indeed very close to the mark. For example, Canis familiaris' Inactive Pancreatic Lipase-related Protein 1 (LIPR1_CANFA, P06857) is predicted as having MACiE mechanism M0218_pancreatic_lipase. In fact, as recorded in Swiss-Prot's annotation, this protein was originally thought to be a pancreatic lipase [55, 56] , but has been shown to lack lipase activity [57] . The same is true for the inactive pancreatic lipase-related proteins of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus which are also all predicted as M0218_pancreatic_lipase (UniProt accessions LIPR1_HUMAN/P54315, LIPR1_MOUSE/Q5BKQ4 and LIPR1_RAT, P54316 respectively). The method also predicts Legionella pneumophila's Protein DlpA (DLPA_LEGPH, Q48806) as citrate synthase (MACiE M0078), and the protein is in fact highly related to the citrate synthase family, but lacks the conserved active His at position 264 which is replaced by an Asn residue.",

The training set used for prediction includes all mechanism labelled proteins (the mechanism and negative sets) and all Swiss-Prot non-enzymes (the swissprot-non-EC set) with their InterPro attributes and MACiE mechanism class labels.
