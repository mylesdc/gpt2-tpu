            "text": "Canine influenza virus (CIV) subtype H3N2 is a newly identified, highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes cough, pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms in dogs. Data indicate that the virus is responsible for recent clinical cases of dog disease in China. However, therapeutic options for this disease are very limited. In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CIV JS/10 (an H3N2 subtype virus) were produced and characterized. Among them, mAb D7, which is specific for the HA2 glycopeptide (gp), induced the highest neutralization titers. The protection provided by mAb D7 was evaluated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of H3N2 influenza virus, including two strains of CIV and one strain of swine influenza virus (SIV). The data show that mAb D7 protected the mice from infection with the three viral strains, especially the homologous strain, which was indicated by the recovery of body weight, reduction of viral load, and reduction of tissue damage. Moreover, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs, as detected by ELISA, were reduced in the infected mice treated with the mAb D7 compared with those without mAb D7 treatment. Thus, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a mAb could reduce the release of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 associated with tissue damage by CIV infection and that the mAb might be of great therapeutic value for CIV infection.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus, a highly contagious pathogen, can infect both birds and mammals. It has undergone significant genetic variation to adapt to different hosts [1] . Its interspecific transmission is achieved by the recombination or direct transfer of genetic material [2] . The first case of dog infection with H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) was reported in the USA in 2004 [3, 4] , followed by a report of CIV in South Korea, which subsequently demonstrated that CIV was able to transmit directly from dog to dog [5, 6] . Recently, the first case of H3N2 CIV infection was reported in Guangdong Province in 2010 [7] . Over recent years, infection with H3N2 CIV in dogs has developed from scattered cases to wide distribution across the country [8] [9] [10] . Dogs have no natural immunity to this virus, thus a number of preventive and therapeutic measures against CIV have been attempted to control the prevalence of this virus. Among them, vaccination is an important method to prevent and control influenza virus infection [11] [12] [13] . Current vaccine research against CIV has made some progress. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved a list of vaccines against H3N8 CIV, which could effectively reduce viral shedding [14] . In 2012, the patent for an H3N2 CIV vaccine in South Korea was also approved [15] . Preventive vaccination is historically the primary measure to control influenza virus infection, but it has some limitations [16] . For example, influenza vaccines may not be effective enough to prevent against divergent viral strains, or may be less immunogenic and effective in certain groups, such as the very young, the old, and the immunocompromised [17] . Therefore, it is crucial to develop other measures to protect animals from infection/disease [18] . For example, passive immunity by transferring a specific antibody to a recipient could protect animals from infection [19] . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can neutralize viruses, thus preventing virus attachment to, or fusion with, the host cell [20] . Many studies have demonstrated that mAbs are an effective and preventive treatment against human-origin [21] [22] [23] or avian-origin influenza virus infection [11, 24, 25] . However, to date, there are no neutralizing mAbs available to prevent and control H3N2 CIV infection.",

After challenge with JS/10, viral loads in lungs of mice treated with mAb D7 were significantly lower than those in the other two groups at 4, 6 and 10 dpi (P < 0.01) ( Figure 2D ). For strain GD/12, viral titers of the lungs in the mAb D7 group were significantly lower compared with the other two experimental groups at 4 (P < 0.05) and 6 dpi (P < 0.01). In addition, at 10 and 14 dpi, viral RNA could not be detected in some lung samples (1/3 and 2/3, respectively) in the mAb D7 group ( Figure 2E ). For virus SD/05, the viral titer of mice in the mAb D7 group was significantly lower than in the other two groups at 6 (P < 0.05), 10 (P < 0.01) and 14 dpi (P < 0.05) ( Figure 2F ). For mice in the virus-infected group, peak viral titers of three virus strains JS/10, GD/12 and SD/05 were 10 8.4 , 10 7.3 , 10 8.5 copies/g, respectively, while for mice in the mAb D7 group, peak values were 10 6.5 , 10 6.4 and 10 7.8 copies/g, respectively.",

In brief, histological lesions were characterized by multifocal to coalescing reddish consolidation in mice infected with the virus JS/10, GD/12 or SD/05 in both the virus-infected and irrelevant mAb IgG groups. However, the degree of histological lesions observed for SD/05 was the most severe, and GD/12 showed the least severe lesions among these three viruses. Mice treated with mAb D7 showed only mild necrotizing bronchiolitis and ciliated tracheal epithelium with mild hyperplasia ( Figure 4F ). In addition, very small gaps were observed between the alveoli and there were no excessive amounts of alveolar macrophages in the lung (Figures 4B  and D) . For virus strain GD/12, mAb D7 demonstrated the best protective efficacy compared with the other two viruses. Mice in the PBS group showed bronchia with a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and the alveolar cavity as a vacuolated thin-walled structure ( Figure 4G ). Viral antigen staining was present in almost all bronchiolar epithelial cells and some alveolar cells at 6 dpi after virus challenge ( Figures 5A, C and E) , while mice in mAb D7 showed only a little virus antigen staining surrounding vessels near the alveoli (Figures 5B, D and F) . The PBS control group had no viral staining ( Figure 5G ). Lung grades for degree of injury at 6 dpi are shown in Figure 6 .

In this study, we developed seven mAbs against JS/10, whose pathogenicity has been characterized both in mice [8] and dogs [40] . Among them, four mAbs reacted with HA. The HA glycoprotein is the primary target of antibodies that confer protective immunity to influenza viruses [41] . Therefore, the generation of neutralizing antibodies against antigenic sites on the HA glycoprotein is regarded as a criterion for evaluating immunity to influenza viruses and is believed to constitute the main correlate of protection [42, 43] . Anti-HA globular head mAbs have potent neutralizing activity against homologous strains, but have very limited breadth of reactivity because of the high variability of amino-acid changes in the HA1 globular head [44] . HA2, which is the HA stalk, however, is a conserved region of HA among all influenza A virus subtypes [33, 45] and is responsible for the fusion of the virus and the endosomal membrane during the entry of the virus into the cell [20] . Here, western blotting showed that MAb D7 recognized the HA2 domain of H3, and had highest neutralization activities. Although MAb D7 lacked HI activity, some previous studies reported that a lack of in vitro HI activity of anti-HA2 MAbs does not rule out protective activity in vivo [33, 45] . Therefore, we selected the anti-HA2 MAb D7 for further evaluation in regards to protection against different influenza virus strains.",

Considering that almost all H3N2 CIV isolates reported were not lethal to mice or dogs in challenge experiment [5, 8, 10, 15, 40] , we evaluated the protection efficacy by body weights, viral loads and histological lesions. Body weight loss is the parameter most commonly used to evaluate influenza viral pathogenicity in mice [46] . Our study shows that all three virus strains could remarkably reduce the growth rate of the mice after infection, while pretreatment with mAb D7 helped to control the declination to some extent. From the pathological point of view, the lung, heart and brain in mAb D7 treated groups showed markedly fewer lesions compared with the virus-infected group and mAb IgG group, with all virus strains. The pathological scores of the lungs in mAb D7 group were lower than those in the virus-infected group and mAb IgG group, suggesting that mAb D7 could mitigate the damage caused by influenza virus. These results suggest that mAb D7 could offer a protective effect against the three virus strains.",

The mAb D7 decreased the viral loads in the lungs to significantly lower levels, relative to those in the virusinfected group and mAb IgG group. Similar results were also found in other tissues. For JS/10, the virus in the brain and other organs of all three mice treated with mAb D7 had been cleared by 10 dpi, except for the lungs. For virus GD/12, the application of mAb D7 caused virus clearance from the intestine and feces 4 days earlier than that in the other two groups; moreover, there was no detectable virus RNA at 14 dpi. For virus SD/05, a slower rate of clearance of viral load was observed. This virus could persist and be detected in most tissues in the mAb D7 group until 14 dpi, but virus in the intestine and feces had been cleared by 14 dpi. These results indicate that protection against the virus strains provided by mAb D7 might be caused by earlier clearance of the virus from the tissues or shortening the time of virus shedding. A previous study has reported that mAbs could reduce the period of virus clearance [23] .",

This finding was in accordance with a previous report [47] that HA2 mAbs are highly cross-reactive among strains of the same subtype, and even within different subtypes. In spite of this, we found that this mAb was relatively less effective against the swine-lineage than caninelineage H3 virus strains. Sequence analysis of amino acids showed that JS/10 had higher sequence identity to canine-lineage GD/12 (98.6%) than to swine-lineage SD/05 (84.8%), with 3 and 16 different amino acids, respectively, in HA2 (data not shown). The difference in amino acid sequence may affect antigen-antibody recognition. This may explain why the mAb induced by canine-lineage influenza virus strain JS/10 is not strong enough to react against more distantly related strains within the same subtype.",

A previous study showed similar results: IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs of pigs infected with human H1N1 influenza virus peaked at 3 dpi, and 6 dpi respectively [49] . IFN-\u03b3 has important immune-regulatory functions and antiviral activity, and is primarily produced by natural killer (NK) and T cells. NK cells are a major player in innate immune responses. We speculated that early production of IFN-\u03b3 during infection probably arises from NK cells, whereas TNF-\u03b1 functions relatively late in the inflammatory cycle induced by infection, at a time when virus is already being contained and the response is centered on resolution of the inflammation [50, 51] . TNF-\u03b1 in mice challenged by JS/10 and SD/05 maintained higher levels until 14 dpi. A previous study demonstrated that the depletion of TNF-\u03b1 in influenza or respiratory syncytial virus-infected animals significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation and cytokine production, without compromising viral clearance [52] . We speculated that the elevated level of TNF-\u03b1 at 14 dpi might be correlated with the uncleared virus loads in the lungs.",

During H5N1 influenza virus infection, the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine response has been proposed as the main cause of the increased severity of the disease [54] . The study of Lee et al. [55] reported that the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs of dogs infected with H3N2 influenza virus increased quickly, while the infected dogs developed severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia accompanied with massive infiltration of immune cells. This result suggests that the dysregulation of chemokines during H3N2 CIV infection might contribute to viral pneumonia characterized by extensive immune cell infiltration. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that elevated levels of cytokines accompanied the clinical manifestations in the CIV infected dogs.",

These observations indicate that mAb D7 treatment may reduce the virus-induced cytokine production and pathological lesions caused by virus infection.
