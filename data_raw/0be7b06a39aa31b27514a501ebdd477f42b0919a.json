This idea requires the ability of such systems to 'tinker', i.e., to creatively respond to changes in their environment. A fairly obvious example of this is natural selection-driven evolution. In this ubiquitous process, an original entity, challenged by an ever-changing environment, creates variants that evolve into novel entities. Analyzing functions that are essential during stationary-state life yield examples of entities that may be antifragile. One such example is proteins with flexible regions that can undergo functional alteration of their side residues or backbone and thus implement the tinkering that leads to antifragility. This in-built property of the cell chassis must be taken into account when considering construction of cell factories driven by engineering principles.",

There he asserted that, contrary to the favored emphasis on intelligent engineering, \"tinkering outperforms design\". This property enables finding unexpected solutions, especially when challenged by \"normal accidents\" [2] , rare deleterious events (in terms of individual probability of occurrence) for which he himself coined the phrase \"Black Swan\" events [3] .",

The expected fate of the entity is sealed: either it hardens for some time, stays the same or it breaks down. Should we extend this view to define a possibly new concept, antifragility? To define antifragility, Taleb opposes the fragility of the Damocles' Sword not to the robustness of the Phoenix (who rises from the ashes), but to the inventiveness of the Hydra (who gets two heads each time one is cut off). Is it possible to think of entities that would not just resist the ravages of time but, through the creation and recombination of novel components, actually become able to cope with an unpredictable future? More generally, can we identify processes that make an entity stronger (sturdier) through the effect of ageing, shock or stress?",

            "text": "In many of its features, life indeed appears to share this property with the Hydra: challenged, it responds by creating new forms of life. This property is at the root of our models of evolution. We use dichotomies to construct the Tree of Life. Of course, many (most) branches are cut off forever-and the Greek Hydra is not an immortal animal-but in the succession of generations, antifragile life tends to expand its exploration of the world by generating a systematic creation of novelty. This is illustrated by the huge number of new life forms that flourish following mass extinctions. On shorter time scales, we know well that it takes only a few months before anticancer drugs are defeated by cells trying to become immortal. In the same way, resistance to an antibiotic follows shortly after its introduction. Moreover, resistance does not simply result from horizontal gene transfers, using some hidden form of pre-existing resistance, but, quite often, from the emergence of a completely novel activity. For example, while the precursor of Nylon \u00ae never existed before the creation of this man-made polymer, it did not take long to find bacteria that used it as a nitrogen and carbon source [9] . The enzymes involved have been created de novo from apparently random pieces of DNA [10] . In the same way, emerging diseases are often the progeny of pre-existing diseases. The SARS coronavirus evolved a novel surface antigen [11] , and the Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain assembled traits that were distributed in the environment with a completely different pattern [12] . Evolution, then, should be reconsidered in this new light. Living systems are antifragile in that they can do much more than simply respond to the \"pressure\" of the environment by random mutations followed by selection; they have an in-built property that allows them to find solutions in the face of adversity. Antifragility is one such property. It unfolds not only in individual organisms, which age much slower than what could be expected from a fragile entity, but also in the way they generate a progeny. All these processes have in common the ability to create some novel information: antifragility cannot be separated from management of information [13] .",

Rather than study multicellular organisms, where a variety of cells with complicated hierarchies display the functions of life, possibly hiding important underlying principles, we restrict our views to unicellular organisms, bacteria. We first recount the core functions, emphasizing their relative position in the process of ageing. We focus on \"steady state\" or \"stationary\" life, which we see as differing from senescence, the continuous degradation of the cell's components as time elapses (in human beings the analogous ageing-before-senescence stage would be roughly between ages 25 and 50). Subsequently we explore the process of antifragility [14] (without bothering to carry over likely challenges about the novelty of the concept) using a specific molecular example. Choosing among a variety of antifragile processes, we discuss the existence of (literally) flexible proteins and the processes in which they participate. We show how this could help delay the senescence process, providing an example of how tinkering and antifragility work together during ageing. The final discussion recapitulates the possible roles of these processes in biology at the cellular level, focusing on the stationary regime.",

In the absence of reproduction there would be no life unless it could be created spontaneously at a high rate. Were all organisms suddenly sterilized, life would continue until the last of them dies, and would then disappear. Reproduction must therefore be introduced as a core feature of what life is, beyond functions associated to stationary life. This creates a conflict between reproduction and stationary life, implying some trade-off between reproduction and survival of the individual [15] . Yet, because, by far the longest time spent by most organisms during their lifetime does not involve reproduction, we limit our exploration to life under stationary state. Indeed, if reproduction were allowed to proceed unchecked, the Earth would have been covered by one species that would have subsequently been halted in its tracks by exhaustion of nutrient supplies.",

This question is essential for scaling up Synthetic Biology processes. It requires us to try and make a thorough inventory of functions, taking care not to forget unobtrusive but essential ones. To this aim, we separate cells into two independent components [16] , the cell (the chassis) and its program. As reproduction is not essential during the stationary phase, we restrict our analysis to the functions of the chassis and the associated turnover of its components [17] , reserving some thoughts about the constraints at the onset of reproduction to the end of this article. Note that we do not limit ourselves to structures (the term \"chassis\" is misleading in this respect), but explore processes as well. We further note that during the stationary phase the ever-ageing cell must either entirely freeze its metabolism and lay dormant (as a spore, for example; some Viable But Non-Culturable Cells (VBNC) might also represent this state [18] ), or maintain a minimum core metabolism and energy supply, to be ready to start again multiplying when the conditions get better.

Nutrients are imported and waste products are exported. In parallel, the cell monitors its sensors. Two types of sensing are used: sensing the physical state of the environment (temperature, light, pressure, etc) and sensing chemicals. The physical constraints cannot be neglected. Except in homeothermic organisms, changes of environmental temperature are immediately passed on to the organism. Because the effects of temperature on macromolecules are often similar to those of ageing (misfolding is the consequence of both changes), there may be considerable overlap between sensing ageing and sensing temperature variations. Indeed, molecular chaperones have both the role of sensors and of maintenance systems and they belong to the heat shock response [20] . Hence, because these molecules must act on a large number of substrates, we may assume that functions fulfilled by molecular chaperones are to be executed in priority in stationary life.",

Fortunately, turnover of metabolites and salvage processes minimize the need to resort to the environment for their supply. Salvage is not a heavy-duty process. Although necessary, it should not belong to the first-line protection because few functional molecules of the corresponding enzymes are needed in the salvage process (this is akin to the marginal cost of a process in the financial world). Similarly, the time-dependent decay of most functions involved in transport of chemicals into the cell can be compensated for through considerable redundancy. The cell only needs to transport a few categories of products: amino acids, simple carbohydrates or dicarboxylates, polyamines, vitamins and ions. This is readily observed in the organisms that can live with a very low number of genes such as Mycoplasma genitalium [21] . Redundancy in the function of transporters, either pre-existing or resulting from the process of ageing, will limit the number needed to be conserved in the long term. Overall, in contrast with the front-line requirement for molecular chaperones, there is no heavy-duty requirement for these functions that may slowly deteriorate over time without dramatic consequences.",

This requires the continued use of the global biosynthetic capacity of the cell. Unfortunately, the identification of essential ubiquitous functions is somewhat difficult, as they cannot be solely identified using comparative genomics. While functions may be ubiquitous, enzyme structures are not [22] . In the present work we used sets of persistent genes [23] to identify the essential functions for stationary life. Consider a bacterium after it has entered stationary phase. RNAs are expected to turn over first, as they are seldom repaired (see however [24] ). This process is managed by the degradosome and related activities [25] . The degradosome structure (exosome in Archaea and Eukarya) is highly diverse, being different in gamma-Proteobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, for example [26] . It always contains polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) at its core: This enzyme uses phosphorolysis rather than hydrolysis, generating nucleoside diphosphates instead of nucleoside monophosphates as basic building blocks for nucleic acids, followed by the recovery of one quantum of energy [27] . Associated to PNPase we find a variety of ribonucleases of different descent, such as RNase E in gamma-Proteobacteria or RNase J and RNase Y in Firmicutes [28] , energy-dependent helicases, as well as core enzymes of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway [25] . We also find co-evolving proteins meant to degrade leftovers, such as nanoRNases of various families, depending on the phylogenetic clade [29] .",

            "text": "A puzzling observation stems out from the composition of the degradosome: Many of its functions are carried out by proteins that are significantly longer than average bacterial proteins (300 residues). This is counter-intuitive because the synthesis of long proteins is expected to be fragile. The probability of transcription/translation errors, especially the premature termination of translation, is proportional to the length of the messenger RNA. Moreover, it is well known that truncated proteins in complexes display a negative-dominant phenotype [30] . However, the significance of this bias is supported by further observations. RNA turnover implies that the first anabolic function that must be preserved is transcription, because any requirement for re-synthesized macromolecules will first go through this step. RNA polymerase is its core component. Surprisingly, it involves two very large subunits (more than 1,300 residues), RpoB and RpoC. This might have just been a statistical coincidence, but an experiment shows that length is significant. Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, which thrive in difficult environments, fuse RpoB and RpoC into a single gigantic protein. Splitting it back into two components makes the cell sensitive to the denaturing agent urea, showing that premature termination followed by re-initiation is not an option for recovery [31] . Other important components of the machinery are also large, e.g., NusA [32] or the transcription-repair factor Mfd [33] . Is there a special property, associated with increased length that could compensate for the fragility of synthesis of long molecules?",

Many energy-dependent proteases have been characterized, including Clp, Lon, and FtsH (HflB) in E. coli. Clp proteases are degradation machines composed of a sensor required for both substrate recognition and ATP-dependent selection for unfolding, and of a peptidase made of multiple subunits, required for substrate hydrolysis (see e.g., [38] ). Clp proteases (ClpP) use the ATPase subunits to choose between folded and unfolded substrates. The importance of choosing (i.e., collecting information on) the substrate to be degraded is illustrated by the unexpected role of a novel class of antibiotics, acyldepsipeptides, that are active against ClpP. The acyldepsipeptide-activated ClpP core initiates proteolytic degradation without the control exerted by Clp-ATPases. This unchecked activity, which demonstrates that the energy of ATP is not used in the very process of protein hydrolysis, leads to the inhibition of bacterial cell division and eventually cell death [39] .

Enzymes are perceived as rigid structures that select their substrates and synthesize products with minimal movement. The discovery of allostery changed that picture to some extent, but it still rested on the idea that activity was linked to stable and fairly rigid conformations. Yet, even crystalline proteins have \"disordered\" regions that do not show up in the final 3D structure, as they are invisible to X-ray diffraction due to their random distribution.

It reflects the selective stabilization of a conformation belonging to the spontaneous thermal fluctuations of the region of interest, leading to a final form after recruitment of proper short-range interactions (hydrogen bonds, dipolar and van der Waals interactions). Dunker and co-workers shifted the paradigm, showing that as much as one fourth of all proteins displayed a disordered structure [49] . Rather than use this negative qualifier, we here prefer \"flexible\", which suggests a specific dynamic order typically relevant to processes of epistasis [50] . Despite some controversy about the role of disordered proteins, it has now been established that flexibility is part of the function of the protein, which must not interact rigidly with its targets and should be degraded once its role has been completed [51] . An example is the recent discovery of the structure and role of RNase Y in B. subtilis [28] . In short, function may require the selection of structures that can only appear after the fact, via proper multimolecular interactions.",

However, in addition to being more flexible, long proteins display remarkable structural features. Longer proteins can fulfill more easily than short ones the requirements for unfolding and misfolding stability, because they have a higher number of native interactions per residue. They are also relatively enriched in small amino acid residues. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the tendency to misfold and protein hydrophobicity, with long proteins being less hydrophobic than short ones [53] . Interestingly, when hydrophobicity is low, long proteins are more resistant to unfolding and misfolding than short proteins [54] . The collapse of unfolded polypeptides, generally believed to be driven by hydrophobic forces, is an early event in the folding of a protein. Whether hydrogen bonds and side chains play a significant role in the process has been an open question. This has recently been addressed by demonstrating that the backbone displays a considerable organizing role [55] . It seems important therefore that flexibility be a core feature of proteins involved in stationary conditions. Before discussing in more depth the way antifragility may exploit flexibility, we explore some features of flexible regions, which might be a trait selected in proteins that must solve new functional questions while ageing.",

Post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications show that some metabolism-dependent changes are genetically programmed. At the same time, basal metabolism is required to allow the cell to maintain its activity. Many metabolites are not innocuous. Some have intrinsic reactivity: dicarbonyls (including reducing carbohydrates) react with accessible amino groups resulting in glycation [56] and respiration produces free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that modify nucleic acids and proteins. The role of ROS is often perceived as negative. However, in addition to being a potential threat to cellular integrity, ROS are also used in a programmed way by the cell, for example in insects, where ROS-triggered protein alteration is required for the formation of the exoskeleton [57] . In the same way, laccase is involved in formation of the spore coat defense in Bacillus subtilis [58] . Superoxide is essential for longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans [59] and there is evidence in mice that several oncogenes actively promote a ROS detoxification program that is required for tumour initiation [60] . This raises questions such as: Is the ROS-dependent modification of a common amino acid, such as methionine oxidation, programmed or accidental [61, 62] ? Is an oxidized protein a prelude to senescence or a form of the protein that has evolved specifically with the function of regulation, for example?",

            "text": "To illustrate concretely these points, here is a detailed example of a specific time-dependent posttranslational molecular mechanism. Flexibility favors cyclisation of aspartate and asparagine residues into L-succinimide ( Figure 3) . This process is both fast and frequent, in particular at asparagine-glycine (AsnGly) motifs because of the intrinsic flexibility of glycine [73] , with an associated deamidation of asparagine. L-succinimide will either hydrolyse into L-isoaspartate spontaneously or after methylation (in 2/3 of the cases), or L-aspartate (in 1/3 of the cases). Subsequently, L-succinimide will isomerise into D-succinimide at a slow rate, and then lead to formation of D-isoaspartate and D-aspartate residues. As a consequence, proteins with flexible regions containing aspartate or asparagine residues will considerably change over time, leading to multiple states, depending on the past history of the protein. Remarkably, the beta subunit of RNA polymerase contains conserved AsnGly motifs. Because of the cost of resynthesising the protein, if destined to become rapidly non-functional after cyclisation-deamidation, these motifs should have been genetically rejected rather than preferred, unless deamidation is of positive biological value. In the same way, aspartates modified by phosphorylation or methylation are also prone to cyclisation. This may lead to loss of activity, creation of novel functional properties, such as regulatory properties or novel catalytic features (reviewed in [73] ).",

In some cases, once a protein has been modified (e.g., alkylation of a cysteine residue in the Ada enzyme dealkylating DNA [78] ), it must be degraded and resynthesized. However, this is extremely costly and should be limited to some rare situations when it is better to lose energy than control. This cannot be the rule, and inevitable time-dependent changes in macromolecules provide good reasons to suspect that some have been recruited for being functional in the long run, and even to alter their function in a context-related positive direction, allowing them to display antifragile features. This could account for the bias towards long proteins among those that are needed during stationary ageing, the maturation process preceding deleterious senescence.",

Antifragility could use pre-set properties selected during evolution, such as the retention of asparagine or aspartate residues at specific positions in proteins, and a context-dependent ability to cyclize. This way, the cell could learn and memorize a particular moment in its history, and fixate it so that it could be recalled later on when similar conditions appear. Antifragility would thus be a way to implement a form of epigenetic memory and contribute to the overall mechanisms of network epistasis [50] . In the present context it has properties similar to those used in the market of financial derivatives: the cell develops a diverse population of molecules of processes such that, under challenging conditions, one or more will emerge and improve the cell's fate in a much better way than a uniform population would have [14] . At this point, an aged cell, when facing suddenly a medium where it could reproduce, would initiate a round of replication. We did not discuss here the corresponding required processes and functions, which may underlie the widely spread observation of VBNC [18] , but the present view should be seen as a pre-requisite to explore this stage of life that represents up to 99% of the bacteria present in the environment.",

How could order be identified? Remarkably, there exists a built-in property of large systems of relationships that may answer the question. The cell is constantly in the midst of a huge network of interacting partners. This constitutes an evolving graph. Can we identify some order in the graph? An important feature of large interaction graphs is that they comply with Ramsey's theory, which states that a sufficiently large system, no matter how random, must contain highly organized subsystems [79] . Antifragility is contextdependent. But there is no means for an antifragile structure to know whether the constraints that made it evolve came from the outside or from the inside. Antifragile structures and processes that would change state when some order is reached could memorize a diagram of that particular order. In this way, once time has taken its toll on the organism, a network of interactions would have been created via antifragile modifications of multiple elements, allowing it to trigger re-synthesis of some components that would fit in place in the graph, because the interaction graph itself would play the role of the original situation that enabled its creation.",

An antifragile entity will sense and record \"on the fly\" memories from the bottom up (for example asparagine cyclisation and deamidation will depend on temperature changes, frequency of the involvement of catalytic activity).
