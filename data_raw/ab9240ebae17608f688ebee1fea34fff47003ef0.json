Methods: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of \"Pneumonia\" from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters.",

By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low-and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (< 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on \"Pneumonia, Bacterial\" (19.99%), followed by \"Pneumonia, Pneumococcal\" (7.02%) and \"Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated\" (6.79%).",

The World Health Organization (WHO) predicted that deaths from lower respiratory tract infections would remain among the top four causes of deaths up to at least 2030 [7] . Antibiotic-resistant strains have also been on the rise, although resistance does not appear to be related to mortality. However, pneumonia is associated with high rates of hospitalization and length of hospital stay. Moreover, it has considerable long-term effects on quality of life, and long-term prognosis is worse in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia [1] .",

To specifically analyze collaboration between countries, collaboration networks were generated for each of the three quinquenniums using Pajek software.

In order to facilitate the analysis, we eliminated some excessively generic descriptors (like \"humans\" or \"animals\"), along with geographical descriptors and those related to age groups. These descriptors showed very high-density relationships, complicating the analysis and the interpretation of the results, so we analyzed their frequency more specifically. -Visual representation of the network. To establish the main topics that exist for each type of pneumonia and to represent them visually, we used a clustering algorithm in the VOSViewer program, which helps to detect the communities (clusters) within a network, made up of groups of homogeneous items that are strongly related to each other. The different groupings, in the form of \"islands\" in red tones, represent the main clusters of the thematic networks, while the chromatic gradation illustrates the areas with a lower density of relations between the MeSH in yellow and green tones.

Table 3 ranks the production of the top 15 countries, adjusted for demographic and economic indicators (see Additional file 1: Table S5 for results on the top 30 countries). When normalized by population, the most productive countries were Switzerland, the Netherlands, Iceland, and Denmark. Adjusted for the GDP index, the most productive LMICs were the Gambia, Malawi, Uganda, and Guinea Bissau. If we calculate the ratio of pneumonia publications to GNI per capita index, the USA, China, India, Malawi y Brazil were the most productive.

In relation to the researchers in R&D index, the USA also leads the ranking, followed by India, Uganda, and China.

Figure 1 shows the collaboration networks between different countries by quinquennium. The most prominent countries in all time periods, occupying central positions in the networks with multiple cooperative links, are the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The presence of South American and African countries is scarce in all periods. Only South Africa has a notable presence in the third quinquennium (Fig. 1a) . A few other countries also \"emerge\" with a high degree of collaborative links in the second period, like Spain, Greece, Italy, Australia, China, and Japan, although the latter two countries are not fully integrated in global networks, showing collaborative ties only with the USA (Fig. 1b) . Finally, other European countries, while present throughout all three periods, stand out to a greater degree in the third period. This is the case of Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, and Austria. At the same time, China and Japan seem more implicated in the network in this third period, while India and South Korea also gain relevance (Fig. 1c) .",

Table 10 shows the number of documents assigned to each term describing the different types of pneumonia (Additional file 1: Table S10 for the 30 top general MeSH). Table 11 ranks the top 15 countries in crude numbers of retrieved articles, stratified by types of pneumonia (Additional file 1: Table S11 for information on the 30 most productive countries). For \"Pneumonia, Aspiration\", the main countries were the USA, Japan, and Germany; for \"Pneumonia, Bacterial\", the USA, France, and Spain; for \"Pneumonia, Pneumocystis\", the USA, France, and the UK; for \"Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated\", the USA, France, and Spain; and for \"Pneumonia, Viral\", the USA, China, and Japan. Table 12 shows the relationship between MeSH terms referring to age groups with those corresponding to different types of pneumonia. The closest associations for \"Aged, 80 and over\" and \"Aged\" were with \"Pneumonia, Aspiration\" (22.58 and 40.56%, respectively), while \"Pneumonia, Viral\" was the most frequent topic for studies in pre-adults (\"Infant\", \"Child\", \"Child, preschool\" and \"Adolescent\"). The one exception to this was \"Infant, newborn\", where the highest proportion of articles was about \"Pneumonia, Pneumocystis.\" In \"Adult\" and \"Middle aged\" people, studies most frequently focused on \"Pneumonia, Bacterial\" and \"Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated.\" Figure 2 shows the subject area maps with the main MeSH terms in the documents on (a) \"Pneumonia, Aspiration\"; (b) \"Pneumonia, Bacterial\"; (c) \"Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated\"; (d) \"Pneumonia, Viral\"; and (e) \"Pneumonia, Pneumocystis.\" The principal MeSH term related to \"Pneumonia, Aspiration\" is \"Deglutition Disorder\", but research is linked to a broad array of topics, including epidemiological aspects (\"Incidence\", \"Risk Factor\", \"Retrospective Studies\"), treatment approaches in intensive care, and surgical techniques procedures facilitating breathing, swallowing, and feeding (Fig. 2a) .",

Different factors may have contributed to this. The first of these is the growing research relevance of pneumonia as a clinical entity, as this disease is one of the community-acquired infections with the highest incidence and is an important cause of hospital admissions. It is also associated with a high global burden of morbidity and mortality in both children and adults [1] [2] [3] 24] . The second potential factor relates to advances in basic immunological and microbiological research along with deepening knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease with regard to aspects like microbiological resistance and preventive interventions (e.g. vaccines) [25] . Thirdly, increased funding has been directed toward research and particularly \"proactive investments for emerging infectious threats\" [8, 9] , and finally, the increase in scientific production could be related to scientific development and international dissemination of scientific research in the WoS databases. This is particularly the case of China and other emerging economies like Brazil, where the rates of growth were highest relative to their respective regions [26] [27] [28] .",
