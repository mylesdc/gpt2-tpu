Berry fruits are characterized by a high content and wide diversity of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, organic acids, tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids [15] . Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between antioxidant systems and the production of oxidants, which is associated with many diseases like cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammation related disorders [16] . A large number of naturally occurring antioxidant compounds have been identified from different plant sources, as free radical or active oxygen scavengers [17, 18] .

The naturally occurring phenolic antioxidants encompass a diverse range of chemical classes that protect against the damage caused by ROS to DNA and membrane and cellular components [33] . The strong antioxidant activities of R. fairholmianus may be due to the phenolic compounds. Previously, Vadivelan et al. [34] reported the antioxidant properties of R. ellipticus root. The root methanol extracts showed strongest radical scavenging activity (IC 50 : 12.2 g/mL) against DPPH \u2022 and (IC 50 : 2.5 g/mL) against ABTS radical. Comparing these results, the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of the isolated column fractions and compounds of R. fairholmianus are highly significant and are almost equivalent and more than that of the standards. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of an allied species R. sanctus has also been reported, which was found to scavenge the DPPH radical by 83.27% compared to vitamin C and BHT (97.15 and 96.47%) [35] .

There are many reports available on the phytochemical characterization and activity guided studies of the related species of Rubus. Most of the compounds isolated from the Rubus species belong to cyanidin type compounds, anthocyanins, and tannins. Ruiz et al. [36] reported the presence of total anthocyanins (0.34-0.92 mol/g), monomeric anthocyanins (0.31-1.16 mol/g), and cyanidin-3-sambubioside in the fruits of R. geoides. Kubota et al. [37] isolated and purified the anthocyanins: cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside from R. croceacanthus fruits and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-Orutinoside from R. sieboldii fruits. Porter and coworkers [38] reported the minor flavonoid components in R. idaeus. Estupi\u00f1an [50] , and Tian et al. [51] reported the presence of cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin glycoside, lambertianin C and sanguiin H-6, and 2 ellagitannins in various Rubus species. Bowen-Forbes et al. [52] reported the presence of Table 3 found to be more than that of the standards letrazole and paclitaxel ( score: \u22123.0 and \u22122.9). The standard drug doxorubicin showed a score of \u221211.1 followed by tamoxifen ( score: \u22125.9). Among the 6 isolated compounds, only three compounds were found to have good docking with target protein. The molecular interaction and docking score of the compounds are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 . The molecular docking results showed that the isolated compound 1-(2hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one is highly significant in binding ( score: . Some of the binding residues were common in both standard drugs and the isolated compounds. The score of isolated compounds ranged between \u22124.5 and \u22123.1, whereas the standard drugs were in between \u221211.1 and \u22123.2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, and other cancers. These proteins are required for the maintenance of genetic stability and have function in DNA damage [53] . Previously, Raja et al. [54] studied the docking analysis of mangrove-derived compounds and revealed that, among six compounds triterpenoid, stigma sterol, and pyrethrin were efficient in destroying BRCA1. Saravanakumar and coworkers [55] proposed the docking of fungal metabolites against BRCA1. The docking score of phthalic acid was lowest (\u221213.71 kcal/mol) followed by 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl acetate and 3-methylcyclopentan-1-ol having the value of \u221211.11 and \u22129.08, respectively. However, there is no report on the docking of isolated compounds from R. fairholmianus against BRCA proteins. So the information gained from this study will be useful for further development of novel breast cancer inhibitors. The binding pocket of BRCA1 contains two chains with two fragments (BCRT1 and BCRT2). BRCA1 is interacting with protein c-terminal helicase 1. The highly conserved C-terminal BRCT repeats that function as a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding module. Clapperton et al. [56] reported the X-ray crystal structure at a resolution of 1.85\u00c5 of the BRCA1 tandem BRCT domains in complex with a phosphorylated peptide representing the minimal interacting region of the DEAH-box helicase BACH1. The structure revealed the determinants of this novel class of BRCA1 binding events. Transcription/antitumor protein BRCA2 contains two chains with a fragment c-terminal WD40 domain having residues 835-1186. The synonym is PALB2, Fanconi anemia group n protein. 19-meric peptides have been identified from BRCA2 protein. The second fragment interacts with PALB2 having residues 21-39. The early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA damage. BRCA2 recruits recombinase RAD51 to sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments, and thereby promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), mutations which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype n of Fanconi anaemia. Oliver et al. [57] have determined the structure of the PALB2 carboxy-terminal beta-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide.",

The score of the three isolated compounds (\u22123.23 to \u22125.28) was higher than standard drugs such as diclofenac, paracetamol, and morphine (\u22123.77, Recent studies have shown that stellatin has COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities which was isolated from Dysophylla stellata. Docking study revealed the binding orientations of stellatin and its derivatives into COX-1 and COX-2 and thereby helps to design potent inhibitors [58] . Olgen et al. [59] reported the COX inhibitory activities of indomethacin derivatives (N-substituted indole-2-carboxylic acid esters). All the derivatives were shown to be docked at the site where intact flurbiprofen was embedded for COX-1 and s-58 (1-phenylsulphonamide-3-trifluoromethyl-5-para-bromophenylpyrazole) for COX-2. Three series of spiro derivatives have been synthesized and docked to COX-2 by Amin et al. [60] . The results showed nearest value of indomethacin. Abdel-Aziz et al. [61] designed a group of cyclic imides (1-13) and evaluated its selective COX-2 inhibition. The molecular docking study showed that the CH 3 O substituents of 5b were inserted firmly to COX-2, where the O-atoms of such group underwent a H-bonding interaction with HIS 90 (2.43, 2.83\u00c5), ARG 513 (2.89\u00c5), and TYR 355 (3.34\u00c5). This revealed a similar binding mode to SC-558, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Basile and coworkers [62] have synthesised 14 sulfonilamidothiopyrimidone derivatives. Compounds 2-5 were able to fit into the active site of COX-2 with highest scores and interaction energies. Furthermore, compound 2, which showed an inhibition of around 50% on PGE2 production, was best scored. El-Sayed et al. [63] designed and synthesized new arylhydrazone derivatives and a series of 1,5-diphenyl pyrazoles from 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4,4-trifuorobutane-1,3-dione 1. The designed compounds docked into the COX-2. Docking study of the synthesized compounds 2f, 6a, and 6d into COX-2 revealed a similar binding mode to SC-558, a selective COX-2 inhibitor.",

            "text": "Synonym of prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 is COX-1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs block prostanoid biosynthesis by inhibiting prostaglandin H (2) synthase. Selinsky et al. [64] reported the crystal structure of COX-1 complex with the inhibitors ibuprofen, methyl flurbiprofen, flurbiprofen, and alclofenac at resolutions ranging from 2.6 to 2.75 A. These structures allow direct comparison of enzyme complexes with reversible competitive inhibitors (ibuprofen and methyl flurbiprofen) and slow tight-binding inhibitors (alclofenac and flurbiprofen). All the inhibitors bind to the same site and adopt similar conformations. In all four complexes, the enzyme structure is essentially unchanged, exhibiting only minimal differences in the inhibitor binding site. The different apparent modes of NSAID binding may result from differences in the speed and efficiency with which inhibitors can disturb the hydrogen bonding network around Arg-120 and Tyr-355. Chou [65] studied the various methods adopted to understand the molecular mechanism of proteins and conduct structure based drug design by timely using the updated information of newly found sequences. He has also reported three main strategies developed in structural bioinformatics, that is, pure energetic approach, heuristic approach, and homology modeling approach, as well as their underlying principles, in a review. These approaches help to understand the action mechanisms of proteins and stimulating the course of drug discovery. In the literature, the binding pocket of a protein receptor to a ligand is usually defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (i.e., an atom other than hydrogen) with a distance < 5\u00c5 from a heavy atom of the ligand. Such a criterion was originally used to define the binding pocket of ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a * complex [66] and has later proved quite useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments. The similar approach has also been used to define the binding pockets of many other receptor-ligand interactions important for drug design. Computational molecular docking is a useful tool for investigating the interaction of a target protein receptor with its ligand and revealing their binding mechanism as demonstrated by various studies [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In this study well known docking program Glide module is used to dock the isolated compounds of R. fairholmianus root acetone and the standard drugs to the active pockets of BRCA and COX target proteins to study the mode of interaction and inhibitory properties. Many marvelous biological functions in proteins and DNA and their profound dynamic mechanisms, such as switch between active and inactive states [67] , cooperative effects [68] , and allosteric transition [69] , can be revealed by studying their internal motions [70] . Likewise, to really understand the action mechanism between a drug compound and its target protein, we should consider not only the static binding structure but also the dynamical information obtained by simulating their internal motions or dynamic process. We will consider this in our future studies.",

            "text": "The present study describes the bioactivity guided isolation, structure elucidation and antioxidant activities, and molecular docking of 6 compounds: 1-(2-hydroxy phenyl)-4-methyl pentan-1-one (1), cis-2-(isopentyloxycarbonyl) benzoic acid (2), 2-(5-methylhexyl) benzoic acid (3), 4-methylpentyl benzoate (4), 3-(iminomethyl)-2,4-dimethylphenol (5), and isopentyl benzoate or 3-methyl benzoate (6) from the root acetone extract of R. fairholmianus. No previous reports are available on the compound isolation and other bioactivity studies of this plant. The investigation describes the isolated compounds from acetone extract of R. fairholmianus root docked to the active pockets of BRCA and COX proteins to predict analogous binding mode of the BRCA and COX inhibitors. The results revealed that the compounds were docked more firmly and inhibited the breast cancer related BRCA1 and BRCA2 oncoproteins and COX-2 and COX-1 inflammatory proteins. Among the 6 compounds, 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one and 2-[(3-methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid were found to be more active in inhibiting BRCA and COX proteins, which also revealed the better results for antioxidant assays. Therefore, these compounds may be considered as the lead compounds for further development of therapeutic drugs.",
