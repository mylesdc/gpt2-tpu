            "text": "Background: Low-income countries with relatively weak-health systems are highly vulnerable to public health threats. Effective public health system with a workforce to investigate outbreaks can reduce disease impact on livelihoods and economic development. Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, nondegree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015-2018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving realtime disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.",

            "text": "The burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uganda is high. Most major health outcome indicators fall well short of desired targets: 343 women die for every 100,000 live births, and 131 of every 1,000 children die before age 5 years. Nearly one in three children under 5 years is stunted [1] . More than half of the disability-adjusted life-years lost in Uganda are due to communicable diseases, in part due to the high HIV prevalence (6.2%) and TB prevalence (3/ 1000) [2] . The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has spread countrywide, and the growing noncommunicable disease burden is of increasing concern [3, 4] As an ecological hotspot, Uganda has infectious disease transmission belts for meningitis, yellow fever, and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The country is prone to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, most of which have occurred in epidemic proportions in recent times with significant cost implications. For example, the cost of responding and controlling the 2017 Marburg Virus Disease outbreak in Kween District, Eastern Uganda was approximately $1 million USD [5] . Addressing all of these health challenges requires a resilient health system, if meaningful prevention and control is to be achieved.",

While there is no doubt that new strategies are needed to respond to evolving systems challenges, even the current available human resources are not being used to sufficiently strengthen the performance of health systems. Evidence-informed policy-making presupposes the availability of high quality, relevant information, and decision-makers may need support to assess what is already known or to articulate demands for specific new evidence.",

The shortage of field epidemiologists in Uganda to address critical aspects of health in the public sector prompted the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH), with support of key partners including Makerere University School of Public Health (MakSPH) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to establish the Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP) in 2015. PHFP is an in-service, post-master's-degree field epidemiology training program (FETP) that attempts to address human resources for health needs. As part of the MoH's long-term sustainability vision, PHFP will exist as a directorate and capacity-building arm of the Uganda National Institute of Public Health (UNIPH); UNIPH is an initiative of the MoH to create an integrated disease control centre, analogous to the US CDC. This paper describes the PHFP, its development and organization, and its contribution to building a resilient and sustainable health system by training a critical mass of competent field epidemiologists in Uganda.",

The PHFP trains midcareer professionals who have a master's degree (or higher) in a health-related discipline and who aspire to become public health leaders. During the two-year fellowship period, fellows are required to attain certain core competencies in domains that include public health emergency response, surveillance data analysis, surveillance system evaluation, applied epidemiologic study, cost analysis of outbreaks, quality improvement science, burden of disease estimation, and leadership skills. Their attainment of these competencies is demonstrated by completing a portfolio of projects in each of these domains.",

These publications have contributed to use of their public health recommendations on a wider scale nationally. Contribution to building a resilient system: Prior to PHFP, there was no investigative arm for outbreak response at MoH; the PHFP created and now leads this arm, as part of the National Rapid Response Team. Outbreak reports prepared by fellows are routinely submitted to the PHEOC and presented at the National Task Force for Epidemic Preparedness and Response, which helps to guide outbreak prevention and control in the country.

PHFP also provided epidemiologic support for nationwide outbreaks of cholera, malaria, measles and anthrax [13] . PHFP fellows have also conducted emergency assessments and evaluations at several refugee settlement areas. Implementation of recommendations from these investigations by MoH and UN agencies has potentially prevented outbreaks and improved the health of the refugees.",

Because PHFP is non-degree awarding and Fellows are required to already have at least a Master's degree on entry, fellows spend more time working on program-oriented projects that address national health needs, and less time in didactic courses. This is different from most FETPs, in which residents earn degrees while in their programs [21] . This model allows the fellows to obtain wide range of experience at all levels of public health in Uganda. Fellows have also demonstrated this capability by producing more manuscripts and presenting a number of papers at national and international level within a short span of time. Compared to the evaluation report of the FETP at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India whose fieldwork led to the production of 158 scientific communications presented at international meetings and to 29 manuscripts accepted in indexed, peer-reviewed journals in seven years.

Had a fraction of that sum of money been used to build an effective health workforce in West Africa for early identification, investigation, and control of outbreaks, both the human and the massive economic toll of the Ebola epidemic could perhaps have been averted. The importance of putting people at the centre of delivery of health services was apparent during the initial response, the early recovery phase, and long-term planning for resilience in the Ebola response [24] . Other recent outbreaks, including the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and the 2015 Zika virus outbreaks, have similarly underscored the need for strong, resilient public health systems to both address the outbreaks and implement containment measures.",

Because the program Secretariat and most host sites are in the MoH, having graduates working in the different programs within the MoH provides opportunity for mentorship of new fellows (Table 2 ). Increased retention of graduates within the Ugandan government will facilitate sustainability of the program. Presently, recruitment in Ministry of Health is the prerogative of the Health Service Commission which derives its mandate from Public Service Regulations. These regulations in its current form does not ring fence any positions for FETP graduates, however, discussion are on the table by all relevant stakeholders to incorporate a clause that will make it easier to recruit and retain FETP graduates in public service. It's important to note that Government of Uganda (GoU) intends to have 3300 field epidemiologists trained to match the current population based on the WHO target of 1 epidemiologist per 200,000 population. Based on the recruitment of 10 fellows per year and the current reliance on donor funding, it will definitely take a relatively long time to bridge this gap. However, GoU's plan to have a fully functional UNIPH which is largely funded by government in the very near future will definitely help in addressing this challenge. In addition, Makerere School of Public Health has produced 340 FETP graduates since inception in 1994.",

The use of evidence generated for disease prevention and control is still limited, partially due to the multiple layers of implementation existing in the Ugandan system. Even when evidence is available, poor dissemination, rigid mindset, poor coordination of partners, and inadequate resources may hamper its utilization. Improved stakeholder engagement with the MOH should be able to address this challenge in the long run. Funding also has some challenges: although PHFP is currently funded by the USA Government, for full integration and institutionalization within the Uganda MoH system there must be domestic resource allocation to support this program. Recognizing this need, MoH has made PHFP a key component of the proposed Uganda National Institute of Public Health (UNIPH) by designating it as a unique directorate [25] . Once the UNIPH is formally established by the Ugandan Parliament, it will become an integrated disease control centre in the country and have diversified funding sources from the government, philanthropists, and the private sector, as well as grants and cooperative agreements from international organisations and foreign governments. PHFP is intended to be its capacitybuilding component, which will provide a competent workforce of field epidemiologists and other health professionals to meet the public health needs of the country [26] . Moreover, PHFP alumni have formed an association called 'Field Epidemiologists without Borders', which will work closely with UNIPH to champion some of the institute's objectives to ensure knowledge transfer and the building of a critical mass of field epidemiologists [27] .",
