While efforts continue in studying the large scale dissemination of contagious diseases, individual-based activity and behaviour study benefits not only disease transmission modelling but also the control, containment, and prevention decision making at the local scale. The potential for using tracking technologies to capture detailed space-time trajectories and model individual behaviour is increasing rapidly, as technological advances enable the manufacture of small, lightweight, highly sensitive, and affordable receivers and the routine use of location-aware devices has become widespread (e.g., smart cellular phones). The use of low-cost tracking devices in medical research has also been proved effective by more and more studies. This study describes the use of tracking devices to collect data of space-time trajectories and the spatiotemporal processing of such data to facilitate micro-scale flu transmission study. We also reports preliminary findings on activity patterns related to chances of influenza infection in a pilot study.",

Spatiotemporal processing was conducted for data cleaning and segmentation. Processed data was validated with traditional activity diaries. The A-GPS data set was then used for visual explorations including density surface visualization and connection analysis to examine space-time activity patterns in relation to chances of influenza infection. Results: When compared to diary data, the segmented tracking data demonstrated to be an effective alternative and showed greater accuracies in time as well as the details of routes taken by participants. A comparison of space-time activity patterns between participants who caught seasonal influenza and those who did not revealed interesting patterns.",

Recent outbreaks of highly communicable diseases [7, [12] [13] [14] [15] have triggered a marked rise in the number of studies on infectious disease transmissions [16] , with equal amount of attention on the mechanisms of global disease spread [3, 8, 17] , and at the regional scale of within countries or cities [4] [5] [6] [7] 13, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Only limited research, however, was reported at the micro scale, such as in the environment exemplified by a relatively closed campus, small community, school, residential, or hospital buildings with a few exceptions [22, 23] .",

Therefore, daily mobility-activity information can be used as an indicator to measure exposures to risk factors of infection. A major difficulty and thus the reason for paucity of studies of infectious disease transmission at the micro scale in the past was the lack of detailed individual mobility and exposure data. Since the records of small-scale movements and contacts between people were generally not available with only a few exceptions [22, 23, 28, 29] , studies of infectious disease were often aggregates in space and time [5] .",

This method is highly demanding for the participants and collaboration from the participants greatly affects the quality of data [34, 37] .",

Global positioning systems (GPS), mobile communications, and wireless network make possible the tracking of human and object movements, generating large amounts of data with unprecedented quality and timeliness at relatively low cost. Applications of these technologies started to flourish in transportation research [38] , retail studies [35] , human ecology [36] , and more recently, health related studies [27, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Examples of health related studies include investigating human mobility affected by diseases or surgeries or in young or aged populations [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , studying physical activity and the environment [48] [49] [50] [51] , and defining specific geographic contexts [52, 53] or an operational \"neighbourhood\" in place-based health studies [54] . Kwan [52, 53] has suggested that examining space-time activity spaces of individuals can lead to more accurate exposure measures. A couple of studies have attempted to track exposures to health risk factors related to human movement [27, 47] , with one targeting infectious disease but the focus was on vector-borne disease only.",

Compared to some controversial study that uses cellphone data when the data collection and analysis was not disclosed to the users [36] , GPS is also associated with less privacy issues as the participants are always informed about the study and only location information is collected. A number of studies have either evaluated the accuracy of portable, low-cost GPS devices [37, 48, 56, 57] or have demonstrated with specific studies the feasibility and effectiveness of their uses in healthrelated research [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . GPS, however, is limited to outdoor tracking. Indoor tracking technologies such as Radio frequency identification (RFID) and Wi-Fi-based positioning systems have only been used in modelling shopping behaviour in a specific grocery store [35] or tracking healthcare personnel or patients in a specific hospital [57] (and see [58] for a review) because all available indoor tracking systems are self-contained and require additional setup in the tracking environment, which can only be implemented within a fixed range.",

A-GPS uses not only satellite signals, but also cellular network resources to locate and use the satellites in poor signal conditions. Satellite signals can be weak due to dense buildings in an urban environment, tree canopy in a wooded area, or poor atmospheric conditions. In such case, A-GPS uses data from a cellular network to obtain faster fix times than standalone GPS. Fix time can be reduced from minutes to seconds and thus leads to more-accurate trip detection [49] . This is particular useful for tracking long durations when objects move both indoors and outdoors, as outdoor locations can be immediately picked up upon exiting from an indoor location.",

One of the objectives of this study is to explore the potential of such technology to be used in the study of infectious disease transmission. To date, there are only a limited number of studies of human mobility in relation to disease transmission at the micro scale [27] [28] [29] . One of the studies used GPS to track human mobility [27] while the other two relied on traditional activity questionnaires [28, 29] . The focus of these studies has been limited to vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne disease depends largely on spatial patterns of vector abundances and can thus be readily evaluated. In case of directly transmitted infectious disease, the risk is not known because the disease carriers engage in dynamic space-time activities themselves. Therefore, risk patterns could only be modelled by examining overlapping of space-time activity spaces of individuals and may possibly inferred by comparing the space-time behaviours of those infected with those of a control group during an outbreak. Therefore, daily mobility-activity information obtained from GPS tracking can be used as an indicator to measure exposures to risk factors of infection.",

Visualization has been suggested to be particularly suitable for dealing with such data when conventional inferential statistics and pattern recognition algorithms fail due to the complex attributes involved [33, 59, 61] .

Among these methods, the interactive 3D STC is the most endorsed because it is more intuitive than other 2D visualizations in handling the multi-dimensions of a space-time trajectory [71] . STC representation is based on Hagerstrand's space-time model [72] and represents individuals' movements in a cube where the base represents geography (space) and height represents time. It features geospatial lifelines related to the movement of individuals. While Miller [63, 64] , Neutens, Zeigler, and Schwanen [65, 66] have focused on the accessibility problem induced by human mobility and focused on the conceptualization of and computation with space-time prisms, others [73] have focused on interaction among individuals during movement and suggested that STC as an effective tool in epidemiological research. Figure 1 below illustrates a simplified STC representation of three college students' activities in the morning of a typical school day, showing some of the concepts in time geography that are the most relevant to micro-scale disease transmission. It shows that student A and C sat in the same classroom for a class period (co-existence in terms of a static bundle). A and B walked by each other without more interaction (point co-existence) but met again later and walked along (co-existence in terms of a dynamic bundle). B and C never had direct interaction but the fact that C (and A) used the same classroom after B left from an earlier class makes it a situation called co-location. In the context of disease transmission, both dynamic bundles and static bundles are highly relevant, whereas point bundles and co-location beyond the lifespan of an airborne virus can be less important.",

Therefore, although STC has been suggested as an effective tool in epidemiological research examples have been limited to large-scale dispersions of identified cases. In this pilot study, we collected detailed outdoor trajectories and inferred indoor stays through spatiotemporal processing of the data collected with an A-GPS. Approximated indoor stays cannot be as precise to specific locations inside a building. Thus we are not able to examine the actual human to human transmission patterns, but only rough estimates of risk patterns indicated by the overlapping of approximated space-time activity spaces of individuals. Risk patterns related to individual's space-time behaviour, however, may be possibly inferred by comparing the behaviours of those infected with those of a control group during an outbreak.",

It uses the SiRF Star III GPS Chipset with high sensitivity to enhance performance in low signal areas. It is A-GPS based with a fast fix time (in seconds) and accuracy within 3 meters in typical outdoor environments [75] . It does not store data in the device but transmits constantly the time and location information to a central storage server. Therefore participants do not need to perform any complicated operation except for charging it every night. One participant was also trained to carry a Garmin eTrex Venture HC GPS receiver and an Apple iPhone 3 with a tracking app (Path Tracker) installed at the same time to collect data with all three devices for one day for comparisons. During the early spring of 2011 (the flu season), a total of 100 participants were recruited to carry the A-GPS device during their daily activities for a week. 96 of them generated over 400 valid day-trajectories. Ten students were also asked to actively record their stops and movements on an activity diary at the same time when they were carrying the devices. The diary contains columns about time, location, and activities such as taking class, dining, etc. for the student to fill up whenever he/she gets a chance to do so during the day. A three-day experiment in our study generated 30 trajectories paired with diary records.",

Preprocessing is thus necessary as the first step of using the collected data. Previous research has addressed the problem with various filtering algorithms, such as though Gaussian Kernel smoothing or using a modified Kalman filter [49] . These filtering algorithms are general smoothing approaches used to reduce random errors in the data. Visual examination of the A-GPS trajectory data collected in our study reveals distinct patterns of errors resulting mostly from indoor stays. Such errors may be easily identified by overlaying the trajectory data with a detailed building layer and manually removed by selecting the erroneous track points. Large volume of data, however, prohibits manual processing. Therefore we developed both an interactive visual interface for manual pre-processing and a heuristic spatiotemporal algorithm based on the same mechanism for automatic batch processing [76] .",

This option is designed for tracking devices that collect tracking points in irregular time intervals due to varying sensitivity of the devices under various physical conditions or segmented trajectories, such as the child tracker we employed in our study. While density visualizations may help reveal overall patterns in the data, we could benefit from highlighting certain time periods to detect more detailed clusters and patterns. Temporal focusing [77] is a necessary addition to the control of a density surface visualization interface to allow for highlighting specific time periods and focusing on the selected sub-set of data for density surface calculation and visualization. (2) Connection analysis. Connection analysis was conducted in our study in an attempt to identify strong connections among places of interests based on the trajectory data collected. For example, our study collected pedestrian trajectories on a university campus. Students walk to different buildings for taking classes, dining, and other purposes. A connection is a link represented by one or multiple segments in the collected trajectory data indicating a student has travelled from one building to another. Such connections can be derived from segmented trajectory data and the strength of each connection can be also determined by the volume of traffic that populates it. A connection analysis may help identify popular connections among campus buildings and infer typical activity sequences on campus. Hotspots such as those buildings with the most outbound or inbound traffic and hubs that connect the most trafficked places by a certain group of students (such as those who were infected by flu) may also be identified.",

It is noted that some portion of the trajectory close to a campus building appears to be noisy (indicated by the spiky portion of the track). This is caused by weak GPS signals around and inside buildings. The spike can sometimes reach very far due to the low-accuracy of positioning when the device is indoors. We employed the automatic pre-processing algorithm on the raw data and conducted spatiotemporal segmentation. Figure 3b shows the preprocessed trajectory and Figure 3c displays the segmented trajectory with color-coded indoor and outdoor segments in the space-time cube with reference to photo imagery and campus buildings.

The handheld GPS has the minimal time interval setting and longest battery life. But continuous data collection over several days would require participants to possess basic skills of using the GPS (i.e., saving tracks). iPhone 3 G has the shortest battery life when set to actively record and save locations. The A-GPS device we used, the Worldtracker GPRS, has a 15 hour battery life that enables the recording of an entire daytime trajectory with a simple plug-in charging at night. It also is not limited in data storage as the data transmits to the data server immediately via a cellular network. All three devices were reported to have similar spatial accuracies. The A-GPS, however, has the coarsest temporal resolution (15 seconds) among the three devices tested. These have resulted slightly more generalized trajectories in timespace as indicated by the red trajectory in Figure 4b .",

Among the 30 trajectory-diary pairs, ten were excluded from our analysis as they either contain incomplete diary records (missing time periods in between records), very short or even no on-campus stays (less than 2 hours), or missing A-GPS signal (one A-GPS was out of battery in the middle of a recording due to forgotten charging). From the diary data, a total number of 55 indoor stays on campus with a total length of 63.15 hours were recorded. The pre-processed and segmented A-GPS trajectories captured 57 indoor stays with a total length of 65.40 hours. Two indoor stays described in the diary were missing from the trajectory data, while the later captured 4 more segments that were not recorded in the diary. The mismatch between the two sets of data could be due to errors in either the segmented trajectory data or the diary data or both. By examining the mismatches and interviewing students who participated in the study we found that one of the two \"miss\"es by the trajectory data lasted only 2 minutes and the other happened after a long-stay in a dorm building when the device probably has suffered from a slow fix time. It has also occurred to us that the diary takers may not have often recorded activities as soon as they happened but wrote their diaries out of memory when time allowed. As a result they often recorded down a rough estimate of time and some activities could be completely missing as such skipped their memories. One problem we noticed from the comparison was that the segmentation algorithm we used sometimes mislabelled an indoor segment in a wrong building, especially when two buildings are connected to each other, which is the case with some buildings in our study, such as a group of dormitory halls on campus. Improvement on this aspect of the algorithm is needed. At the same time, an attempt to remediate the problem exercised in this study was to examine student behaviour by deriving attributes associated with a particular type of activity instead of the specific location-activity. The time that students spent in their dorm buildings is such an attribute. The dorm time recorded in the diary data totalled to be 10.70 and that derived from the trajectory data was 10.32 hours.",

Handheld GPS supports the most temporal details but needs intervention for long durations of data collection. iPhone and the Worldtracker GPRS are both A-GPS based devices. However, the added indoor tracking ability does not lead to improvement as the cellular network positioning accuracy could be 50 meters or greater depending on the density of available cellular network. The battery life of the iPhone device is of the most concern in this experiment but new generations of the smart phone and better apps could improve significantly on this aspect. The Worldtracker GPRS employed in this study generates the coarsest trajectories but is the most user-friendly that doesn't require any user intervention except for night charging. It also supports long duration of tracking as there is no limit of data storage. Comparison to diary data indicated that the trajectory data captured with the GPRS was able to approximate major patterns in students' on-campus activities, and the 15 second time-interval still provides much finer temporal resolution than the traditional diary data could record.",

By controlling the time variable in the trajectory data through temporal focusing, we were able to examine spatial patterns at different time periods. Figure 6 shows the density surfaces at different times of a day in 2D, with red colour indicating high density and yellow being low. It is observed that activity patterns differ and hotspots may change throughout the day. For example, the UC (A) appears to be a hotspot from morning ( Figure 6a ) to late afternoon (Figure 6d ) but slightly cools down toward the evening (Figure 6e ). The dorm buildings (B) do not show high density until the late afternoon. The departmental building cluster indicated by label C seems to be crowded throughout the day but especially so in late afternoon and evening.

The departmental building cluster is home to three departments in the college of natural sciences that lie very close to each other and are connected by indoor pathways, although in separate buildings. Some preliminary speculations on the cause of this pattern include that on one side, the science students who take classes in these buildings tend to stay indoors for a long period of time. On another side, deriving from the temporal hotspot patterns in Figure 6 , these buildings tend to be crowded especially in late afternoon or evening. The university class schedule indicates that classes scheduled in this time are often double periods-taking as long as 2 hour 45 minutes, leading to, again, prolonged indoor stay time. Further investigation, however, needs to be conducted to determine the exact causes of such clustering. This experiment indicates that the method has the potential to reveal hidden space-time activity patterns that may give insights to flu transmission at the microscale.",

Figure 8a shows all straight line connections among buildings captured by the participating students and the highlighted buildings are those with the highest outbound traffic volumes. Figure 8b illustrates the most trafficked connections (bold lines). It shows strong connections among the same group of departmental buildings identified as hotspots in density surface visualization. Strong connections also exist between this group of departmental buildings (with Science building being the centre) and the UC, and between the UC and the Center of Academic Success (CAS), a building that has undergraduate advisement offices and classrooms. Figure 9 shows the connection analysis results for only students who had been sick. Comparing Figure 9 to Figure 8 , we see that one strong connection (between the UC and the CAS building) is no longer present from the set of strong connections identified for sick students only. The two strong connections that remain are one between the UC and the departmental buildings and another among the departmental buildings. The UC is the most heavily trafficked stop on campus being the main recreation centre where the cafeteria, book store, and recreation rooms are located. It was hypothesized as a potential high risk hub during flu season when students interact with each for a long period of time in a crowded space. The departmental buildings involved in the second connection are all attached to each other with indoor pathways. As indicated earlier, our segmentation algorithm has limitations when it comes to labelling segments with buildings especially when the buildings are close together or connected. Mislabelling may have contributed to part of the strong connection shown here. It is also speculated that these buildings have classrooms where students may spend many hours indoors taking classes without having to go outside of a building. These buildings are also relatively old constructions with aged ventilation systems that could increase risks of respiratory disease transmission. The CAS building that appears in the connection in Figure 8 but not in Figure 9 , on the other hand, is a brand new building and stands by itself in a large open space. New ventilation and the fact that student activity has to often involve outdoor time periods whenever taking other classes out of the building both could lead to lower risks. These, are of course speculations but proves that such analysis, like other methods presented in this paper can be a useful exploratory analysis tool to reveal hidden patterns, given the availability of the detailed trajectory data.

Compared to the traditional activity dairy and questionnaire techniques, employment of GPS based devices, such as the A-GPS we experimented in this study, supports convenient collection of large amount of trajectory data. Once processed with an effective data cleaning algorithm the trajectory information can be used in various spatiotemporal analyses and exploratory visualizations such as the exercises discussed in this paper. Such analyses may help generate hypothesis on where and when people engage in behaviour which puts them at risk of contracting the flu through human-to-human contact or air inhalation in a relatively closed environment. In addition to the usual health advice like \"wash your hands or avoid crowding\", more specific space-time activity recommendations could be made.",

Improvement on this aspect of the algorithm is needed. This study also only took some first steps into the examination of spatial patterns using the trajectory data collected. Following these steps, other methods like statistical analyses of variables characterizing one's activity space and activity sequence analyses such as sequence alignment [41, 78] can be performed in order to answer additional questions like how one's activity space and sequences affect risks to infectious diseases. Spatiotemporal interactions such as bundles [64] may also be modelled to examine disease transmission patterns.",

Wi-Fi-based positioning can be a promising technology to lead to highly detailed space-time behaviour data collection and studies with much improved indoor accuracies. However, such high accuracy leads to more serious privacy concerns that may be another barrier for their uses.",

This concern has been one of the limiting factors in efforts to model infectious disease transmission at the micro scale. As need for real-time surveillance and intervention at the micro scale becomes more obvious with increasing threats of pandemics in a globalized world, and as the potential for precise surveillance and intervention explodes with the fast advancement of technology, it is critical to confront the privacy issue involved in using such technology. It is the social responsibility of researchers to protect privacy when using data such as the tracking trajectories collected in this study. Legal regulations regarding the use of such technology and data are also expected to be put in place for both research and practice. Although our current legal framework has not yet adapted to the potential privacy abuses of tracking technology [55] , initiatives such as the US. Federal Communications Commission's E-911 mandate has generated visions in This study explores the potential of using tracking technology for research in infectious disease transmission and expects more applications when new, more accurate data is coming in no time with the current pace of technological advancement and privacy solutions or regulations set in place. With accurate indoor tracking technology, it is possible to set up real-time control and alert systems [79] . The idea is to monitor individual movements with portable devices during an outbreak.",
