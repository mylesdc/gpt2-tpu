            "text": "Respiratory infectious disease epidemics and pandemics are recurring events that levy a high cost on individuals and society. The health-protective behavioral response of the public plays an important role in limiting respiratory infectious disease spread. Health-protective behaviors take several forms. Behaviors can be categorized as pharmaceutical (e.g., vaccination uptake, antiviral use) or non-pharmaceutical (e.g., hand washing, face mask use, avoidance of public transport). Due to the limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during respiratory epidemics and pandemics, public health campaigns aimed at limiting disease spread often emphasize both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical behavioral interventions. Understanding the determinants of the public's behavioral response is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread. While other reviews have qualitatively analyzed the body of work on demographic determinants of health-protective behavior, this meta-analysis quantitatively combines the results from 85 publications to determine the global relationship between gender and health-protective behavioral response. The results show that women in the general population are about 50% more likely than men to adopt/ practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors. Conversely, men in the general population are marginally (about 12%) more likely than women to adopt/practice pharmaceutical behaviors. It is possible that factors other than pharmaceutical/non-pharmaceutical status not included in this analysis act as moderators of this relationship. These results suggest an inherent difference in how men and women respond to epidemic and pandemic respiratory infectious diseases. This information can be used to target specific groups when developing non-pharmaceutical public health campaigns and to parameterize epidemic models incorporating demographic information.",

While influenza transmission can be halted with the use of antiviral medications, mutations in the virus necessitate that a new vaccine be produced for each new flu strain. Vaccination production can take up to six months to complete, with the burdens of delays, likely shortages, and virus mismatch reducing the potential impact of the vaccine. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions often require consultation with a physician or, in more severe cases, hospitalization. These requirements reduce the potential impact of pharmaceutical interventions due to the fact that many people do not have access to health care or refuse to be seen by a health care provider. Additionally, it is often impossible to satisfy this requirement during a pandemic influenza outbreak because the demand for staff, facilities, and equipment often exceeds the supply [5] . The limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during pandemic influenza outbreaks highlight the importance of also incorporating non-pharmaceutical interventions in public health campaigns aimed at limiting respiratory infectious disease spread.",

            "text": "The success of campaigns designed to limit disease transmission relies on the public's protective behavioral responses to an epidemic/pandemic. Some of these responses are individual responsibilities, while others deal with compliance to governmental mandates or laws. Protective behaviors can be broadly grouped into three categories: preventive, avoidant, and management [6] . Preventive behaviors may be non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., hand washing, sanitation, and mask wearing) or pharmaceutical measures (e.g., vaccination uptake). Avoidant behaviors include staying home from work or school, avoiding public or crowded settings, and complying with quarantine constraints, all examples of non-pharmaceutical measures. Management behaviors include taking pharmaceutical antiviral medications and seeking medical help. More examples of health-protective behaviors are shown in Table 1 . An understanding of the demographic determinants of protective human behavior can inform the communication strategies of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions during an epidemic/ pandemic disease outbreak. In addition, determining the drivers that are responsible for these protective behaviors can inform mathematical models that are intended to provide decision support. Mathematical modeling is typically used to understand disease dynamics and assess the impact of different interventions [7, 8] . Recently, several models [9-12] have attempted to include human behavior but their impact has been limited by the lack of quantitative consensus regarding how behavior is influenced by different demographic characteristics. As such, understanding these behavioral factors is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread.",

When two or more publications assessed the same study population, a joint study moniker was created and the relevant data from each publication were recorded under the moniker. Both qualitative and quantitative data were extracted from all included studies. One reviewer (KM) recorded all relevant qualitative and quantitative data from each publication. The second reviewer (SD) cross-referenced the data with the text of each publication to check for accuracy and completeness. Reviewers resolved discrepancies between entries by discussion and consultation of the publication's full text.",

Less commonly, publications reported mean behavior scores and their associated standard deviations by gender. Counts, percentages, odds ratios, and mean behavior scores were all converted to the same effect size, namely log odds ratios and their associated log standard errors [25] . For cases in which relevant findings were reported but an effect size could not be calculated (e.g., publications that included gender in multiple regression equations or hierarchical linear models for behavior), the direction of the relationship was noted for comparison to analysis results. While new techniques have been developed for synthesizing variables from complex models, such techniques are still not widely used or agreed upon [26] . Although the results from complex models are not explicitly included in our meta-analysis, the trends captured by publications using these models are noted in the results section. These trends were recorded in order to compare the distribution of the direction of effects for these complex models to the distribution of the direction of effect sizes used in analysis.",

The following moderators were explored: study design, continent, culture, country development, mean age of sample population, behavior, behavior type (intended, reported, actual), behavior category (preventive, avoidant, management), and overall percentage of respondents adopting/increasing the assessed protective behavior. Sensitivity analyses were performed on each set of studies in three ways: by removing effect size outliers, by using the trim-and-fill method, and by including studies whose results weren't reported on the basis of non-significance. The first sensitivity analysis was performed by removing studies whose effect size was over three standard deviations from the mean effect size for that dataset. The second sensitivity analysis was performed using the trim and fill method in order to assess the potential effect that missing studies may have had on the observed result [24] . The trim-and-fill method augments each set of studies under the assumption that values possibly missing due to publication bias can be imputed based on the distribution of standard errors associated with the given effect sizes. This method relies on scrutiny of a funnel plot for assumed bias-induced asymmetry, which, if present, is corrected through the addition of results that lead to a visually symmetric funnel plot. The final sensitivity analysis included results that were mentioned in a study but for which an effect size value was unreported because of non-significance. Effect sizes were assigned a log odds ratio of 0 and log standard errors were imputed from similar studies following suggestions included in [31].",

However, nearly all of the variability in the effect size estimates was due to heterogeneity among the true effects, none of which could be accounted for by including moderators. Furthermore, the addition of studies based on the trim-and-fill method rendered the observed relationship non-significant. Although the study design of this meta-analysis limits the danger of publication bias influencing the results, the random-effects model using the filled-in study set implies that if publication bias is indeed present, then it has falsely skewed the results in favor of significance. In spite of this finding, the results of the other sensitivity analyses still favor a mildly positive relationship between male gender and uptake of pharmaceutical behaviors. Of the studies addressing pharmaceutical behaviors for which a direction (but not an effect size) was reported males tended to exhibit more behavioral response than females, but this observed relationship has little value given the small sample size (5 studies).",

While the perception of the severity of a disease likely impacts health-protective behavior and may act as a moderator of the relationship we address, we do not have adequate data to create a metric for perceived severity for the publications that did not explicitly report it. Data on the severity of a given epidemic/pandemic respiratory disease outbreak are available in terms of case counts and mortality rates, but data on perceived severity are not so easily obtained. Perceived severity may depend on the proximity of the study population to high-risk areas, news media focus and tone, phase of epidemic/pandemic in which surveys/questionnaires were administered, and a host of other intangibles that extend beyond the scope of this analysis. Similarly, while studylevel demographic differences (i.e., one study administering questionnaires to mostly young people, another to mostly old people) could have an effect, there are not enough studies coming from heavily age-skewed demographic groups to make claims about the impact of age (or other demographic differences in study populations) on the relationship between gender and health-protective behavior.",

Similarly, mathematical disease models including behavior can use these results to parameterize demographic-based model values. In summary, the present study quantitatively suggests that gender influences health-protective behavioral response in the general public, with females being more likely to adopt/increase non-pharmaceutical behaviors and males being more likely to adopt/increase pharmaceutical behaviors. Additional research into moderators of this relationship might help to understand the contexts in which it is attenuated or strengthened.
