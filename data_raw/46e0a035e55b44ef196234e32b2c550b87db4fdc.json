Sequence data are grouped in terms of biological relationships. The number of sequences related to any group is susceptible to be increased every day. All the present alignment-free methods approve the utility of their approaches by producing a similarity/dissimilarity matrix. Although this matrix is clear, it measures the degree of similarity among sequences individually. In our work, a representative of each of three groups of protein sequences is introduced. A similarity/dissimilarity vector is evaluated instead of the ordinary similarity/dissimilarity matrix based on the group representative. The approach is applied on three selected groups of protein sequences: beta globin, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5), and spike protein sequences. A cross-grouping comparison is produced to ensure the singularity of each group. A qualitative comparison between our approach, previous articles, and the phylogenetic tree of these protein sequences proved the utility of our approach.",

The importance of similarity/dissimilarity of biological sequences returns to its relationship with the structures and functions. Proteins with similar sequences usually have similar structures. The rate of addition of new sequences to the databases is increasing exponentially [1] . Comparing these new sequences to those with known functions is a key way of understanding the biology of an organism. Thus, sequence analysis can be used to assign function to genes and proteins by the study of the similarities between the compared sequences. There are many tools and techniques that provide the sequence comparisons.",

Graphical representations are usually accompanied by numerical characterization and then a descriptor to describe each protein sequence.

The smallest Euclidean distance or correlation angle is the more similar. Many graphical representations of DNA and protein primary sequences have been proposed. Some other approaches characterize numerically protein sequences without previous graphical representation and nongraphical representation methods [10, 11] .",

The selected sample is assumed to be unbiased and the population distribution of each group is normal. Therefore, the selected sample represents the group. Statistics can be used to estimate the population's parameters. The adjacency vector is introduced as a novel descriptor for protein sequences. It is computed for each sequence in the selected sample of three groups. A reference vector is then computed for each group. This vector acts as a representative of the group. Each sequence's degree of similarity in each group is measured according to its group's representative vector. So, a similarity/dissimilarity vector is constructed instead of ordinary similarity/dissimilarity matrix. Our approach is independent of the protein sequence length. It does not require any previous graphical representation. It is a mathematically simple approach.",

Therefore, the adjacency vector (A xy ) consists of 400 elements. Every 20 elements are related to each amino acid. The first 20 elements are related to \"A\" amino acid. The second 20 elements are related to \"R\" amino acid. The third 20 elements are related to \"N\" amino acid and so on by the same order which is illustrated previously according to 1 st letter code. We borrow our idea from the 20 \u00d720 adjacency matrix [27] . The adjacency vector counts the possibilities of each pair. In other words, it counts the number of times that each pair is repeated along the sequence length. If the pair does not exist, its value in the adjacency vector is zero. For example, to evaluate the adjacency vector of the two short segments of \"yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" protein [16, 19, [22] [23] [24] 28] Protein I: \"WTFESRNDPAKDPVILWLNGGPGCSSLTGL\" Protein II: \"WFFESRNDPANDPIILWLNGGPGCSSFTGL\" The two protein sequences are composed of 30 amino acids.

For example, \"ND\" pair has a count one in protein I and two in protein II. \"DP\" pair has a count two in both protein I and protein II. \"SL\" and \"LT\" pairs have a count one in protein I and zero in protein II.",

A similarity/dissimilarity vector is produced instead of the regular similarity/dissimilarity matrix. The similarity/dissimilarity analysis is done by two methods. Our approach is applied on three sample sets of three groups of protein sequences. Each sample has a different range of lengths than the others. Our approach does not depend on protein sequence length. It successfully measured similarity/dissimilarity among different lengths. It is very mathematically simple. A cross-grouping comparison is introduced to prove the singularity of each group.
