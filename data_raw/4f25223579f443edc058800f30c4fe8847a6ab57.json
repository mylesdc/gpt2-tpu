The second step involved categorizing the shortlist according to five regions in Indonesia to maximize geographic representativeness. A checklist was developed based on the WHO recommended attributes for sentinel site selection including stability, feasibility, representativeness and the availability of data to enable disease burden estimation. Eight hospitals, a maximum of two per geographic region, were visited for checklist administration. Checklist findings from the eight hospitals were analyzed and sentinel sites selected in the third step. Results: Six hospitals could be selected based on resources available to ensure system stability over a three-year period. For feasibility, all eight hospitals visited had mechanisms for specimen shipment and the capacity to report surveillance data, but two had limited motivation for system participation. For representativeness, the eight hospitals were geographically dispersed around Indonesia, and all could capture cases in all age and socio-economic groups. All eight hospitals had prerequisite population data to enable disease burden estimation. The two hospitals with low motivation were excluded and the remaining six were selected as sentinel sites. Conclusions: The multi-step process enabled sentinel site selection based on the WHO recommended attributes that emphasize right-sizing the surveillance system to ensure its stability and maximizing its geographic representativeness. This experience may guide other countries interested in adopting WHO's influenza surveillance standards for sentinel site selection.",

This guideline built on the lessons learnt from the 2009 influenza pandemic and outlined both the epidemiological and virological surveillance objectives, as well as revised case definitions and minimum data set requirements. The primary objective of sentinel influenza surveillance systems as stated in the guideline is to monitor influenza activity rather than to detect outbreaks. Sentinel influenza surveillance systems can provide valuable information about epidemiological trends including seasonality, age groups affected and groups at risk of severe disease. Sentinel systems can also provide information about virological trends, and to identify the emergence of viruses with unique characteristics or with antigenic drifts or shifts [7] .",

Three of these systems had hospital-based surveillance sites. Evaluations of two hospital-based sentinel surveillance systems, the sentinel pneumonia surveillance system operated by the ARI Subdirectorate since 2007 and the laboratory-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system operated by the National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD) since 2006, found that both had limited utility. Both systems had sites with very low surveillance activity and the sentinel pneumonia surveillance system lacked laboratory data while the SARI surveillance system lacked epidemiological focus. This led the ARI Subdirectorate and NIHRD teams to terminate these systems in December 2012 and combine efforts to establish a SARI surveillance system in 2013 that addressed their collective needs. The new SARI system called 'Surveilans ISPA Berat Indonesia' (SIBI) enabled the ARI Subdirectorate to focus on the epidemiology and influenza disease control program aspects whilst NIHRD focused on the laboratory diagnostics. The objectives of SIBI were to monitor epidemiological and virological trends of influenza in different parts of Indonesia. Even though the system may detect cases of novel or emerging influenza viruses, this was not deemed the primary objective of the system as other systems such as the nationally comprehensive Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) provide such function.",

The guideline also suggests considering the suitability of sites to assess the disease burden of influenza whereby information about the population served by the hospital can be determined to enable disease incidence rate calculation. When multiple sentinel sites are being considered, WHO recommends selecting sites that represent different population centers or climate zones since this will provide information about transmission patterns among sub-populations with unique demographic or socio-economic characteristics. Critically, the guideline states that there is no ideal number of sentinel sites in a country but that countries should start with one or a few sentinel sites and only expand if these function well.",

This results in a push for public health initiatives to have representation according to administrative divisions such as a surveillance site in each province or to apply statistical approaches for calculation of the number of sentinel sites. These approaches may not be suited or feasible for sentinel surveillance systems where the objective is to obtain high-quality patient level data to monitor regional clinical, epidemiological and microbiological disease trends. For example, having sentinel sites in contiguous provinces with similar population demographics would yield more cases enrolled into the system but would not yield additional novel information about regional variation in disease activity. Similarly, having representativeness according to population density would yield large numbers of sentinel sites due to the size of the country but would also not necessarily capture unique regional characteristics. Lastly, since influenza surveillance involves costly laboratory diagnostic testing, the larger the number of sentinel sites the more expensive the shipment and testing of specimens.",

Before applying the WHO guideline for sentinel site selection, we shortlisted from 2,165 hospitals to a manageable number to enable detailed assessment and final selection. To achieve this, we limited selection to public hospitals that had previously participated in the sentinel pneumonia or SARI surveillance systems. We ranked these 50 hospitals in terms of two performance indicators, timeliness and completeness of data reporting to national level. Ranking of hospitals according to their surveillance performance history enabled prioritization of good sites in subsequent steps of the selection process. Timeliness indicated the proportion of on-time reports received by MOH from the sentinel site, where 100% indicated full compliance with data reporting requirements (by the 10th of each month). Completeness indicated the number of reports made to MOH per year, where 100% indicated full compliance (12 reports received from the sentinel site per year). Timeliness and completeness data for the 50 hospitals were extracted from the MOH surveillance system databases. Hospitals with less than 50% timeliness and completeness were excluded based on poor surveillance performance history. This resulted in 20 hospitals in the shortlist from Step One ( Figure 1 ).",

We operationalized this by calculating the yearly costs of one sentinel site and determining the number of sites that could be established using funds available from MOH and donors for the next three years. Cost calculations were based on previous surveillance system experience and included one training for five hospital staff (2 doctors, 1 nurse, 1 laboratory worker and 1 medical records staff ), four monitoring visits to the site, six-monthly national meetings and costs for stationery and staff incentives. Based on previous SARI surveillance experience, each sentinel site was expected to generate 150 specimens per year.

We added three questions to the checklist to explore these issues. For patient volumes, we requested data on total patient admissions not respiratory patient admissions since hospitals may vary in their disease coding and recording systems. Four teams comprising ARI Subdirectorate, NIHRD and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) staff were trained in the sentinel site selection checklist objective and administration. Each team visited two hospitals where the teams met with the hospital director (or management representative), the medical and nursing staff and the laboratory team. These hospital personnel were targeted as they could answer the various administrative and procedural questions in the checklist. After introducing the concept of SIBI and answering any general questions, one team member administered the questionnaire and the others documented the answers. The teams then toured the hospital facilities including the medical records unit, emergency/patient admission, the laboratory and some patient wards. This enabled visual confirmation of the hospital capacity and likely flow of SARI patient enrolment into SIBI. The teams also reviewed medical records data on the number of monthly hospital admissions. Each sentinel site selection visit took 4-6 hours and all hospitals were visited in a three-week period. Funding for the sentinel site selection visits was made available by WHO.",

These included reliance on self-report for checklist items such as the hospital's motivation to participate in the surveillance system and availability of hospital staff to conduct surveillance activities. Respondents may have sought to appease the assessment team by positively biasing their answers. To address this limitation, hospitals ultimately selected as sentinel sites were asked to write a formal letter to confirm their commitment to become a surveillance site, and to list surveillance staff and their specific role in the surveillance system. For other checklist items, such as the proportion of respiratory disease patients receiving chest x-ray or the socioeconomic level of the population served by the hospital, it was not feasible to verify the answers provided by the hospital team during the assessment visit. However, these issues will be revisited in more detail once the surveillance system stabilizes and disease burden can be enumerated. Another limitation is that the sentinel site selection process does not guarantee good surveillance performance. We endeavor to maximize performance through the routine monitoring visits and twice-yearly review meetings.",

A few sentinel sites may appropriately represent the situation in-country and to inform public health officials on groups that need to be targeted for preventive and treatment measures. To date, there have been no studies to investigate whether influenza patterns vary across regions in Indonesia, but since difference regions have different climatic patterns and this is known to impact influenza circulation [12, 13] , it is possible that influenza patterns are different. Future studies will be required to determine whether the six SIBI sites adequately represent influenza activity in Indonesia and the extent to which the clinical, epidemiological and virological findings from the six sentinel sites are generalizable. This approach may address decision-maker concerns about surveillance representativeness in a cost-efficient manner.",
