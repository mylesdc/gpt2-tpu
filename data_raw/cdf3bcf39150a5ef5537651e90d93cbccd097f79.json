The positive rate of FLU-A was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in Conclusions: Exposure to pH1N1 had no impact on typical influenza seasonal peaks, although FLU-A remained the predominant virus for 2010 in Beijing. Symptomatically, cough was associated with FLU-A infection. The positive rate of influenza virus was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to that of 2009.",

Similar to most other countries, the peak influenza season in China is associated with higher health care utilization [2] . In China, weekly cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) in acutecare settings throughout the country are reported to the Chinese National Influenza Center(CNIC) and are mainly attributed to influenza virus, predominantly influenza A virus (FLU-A) and influenza B virus (FLU-B) [3, 4] . In addition to the influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses can also cause ILI symptoms in adults, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), including parainfluenza virus type 4 [5] , rhinovirus, adenovirus, human coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus [6] . Thus, multiple respiratory viruses may circulate among adults and cause influenza symptoms [5] . There is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections, and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection. Some studies have attempted to identify signs or symptoms specifically associated with influenza virus or other viruses [7, 8] , but no definitive conclusions have been drawn.",

PCR was carried out in a PCR Amplifier and the conditions were as follows: 94uC for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94uC for 0.5 minutes, 60uC for 1.5 minutes and 72uC for 1.5 minutes, with extension at 72uC for 10 minutes, followed by storage at 4uC until collected. The samples were divided into two groups for testing, Group A samples were tested for the presence of adenovirus (Adv), metapneumovirus (MPV), human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3. Group B samples were tested for the presence of influenza B virus, human coronavirus OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus (HRV A/B), RSV B/A, and FLU A.",

            "text": "Rates of ILI are an indicator of trends for influenza pandemics [25] . Beijing is located in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, where influenza typically peaks seasonally once a year, and Beijing experience one peak of influenza activity and the peak occurred during December-January next year before 2009 [3, 26, 27] , but ahead to November in 2009 [17, 26] . That the peaks in ILI and the increase in acute respiratory infections (ARI) are due to influenza is supported by the seasonal pattern of highprobability ILI, the low level of respiratory syncytial virus infections, and laboratory results in the influenza season [23, 28, 29] . During the 2010-11 influenza season, a seasonal pattern in ILI activity was observed and influenza activity peaked in late January 2011 in Beijing. Compared with the previous pandemic year (2009), lower outpatient numbers were observed during 2010-11( Figure 2) . Overall, the rates of influenza-like illnesses in outpatients were lower during the 2010-2011 season, than during the 2009-10 pandemic influenza season ( Figure 3) .",

However, it is widely known that a clinical diagnosis of influenza is not straightforward, and it is difficult to find symptoms or combination of symptoms specific for influenza [20, 30] . We found that cough was significantly associated with influenza A (x2, p,0.001). This is consistent with the results of Boivin, of Ohmit and of Monto, who reported that cough and a fever.38uC were associated with a positive PCR test in the influenza population, when influenza was prevalent within the community [7, 31, 32] . Our specimens were collected during the influenza season in Beijing and the cough appears to be specific for influenza in this cohort. This is also consistent with the view of Call et al, who believe that both fever and cough are more specific for influenza among elderly individuals when influenza virus is circulating in an area [30] . We did not find any statistically significant difference in the occurrence of fever (temperature .39uC) between the FLU-A-positive group and the FLU-Anegative group (x 2 , p.0.05). A study that involved all age groups demonstrated that muscle and joint pain and headache were associated with influenza [20] . However, we did not find any statistically significant differences in the occurrence of muscle and joint pain, and headache between the FLU-A-positive group and the FLU-A-negative group (x 2 , p.0.05).",

The number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza by influenza typing is shown in Figure 1. Of the 190 ILI case-patients tested, the positive rates for 2009 influenza A and influenza A(H3) were 5.8% (11/190) and 4.7% (9/190), respectively. Influenza A(H3) was only observed between July and December 2010, and was then replaced by pH1N1. Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) only tested positive in December 2010, and January and February 2011. According to the Chinese National Influenza Center(C-NIC), influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the predominant viral etiological factors from June to early January in North China, and from late January, the 2009 influenza A(pH1N1) was the most prevalent, followed by H3N2 [4].

Our research suggests that FLU-A was the predominant viral pathogen among ILI patients in Beijing from August 2010 to May 2011, which was similar to that of 2009, 2008 and 2006, but different to 2007 [3,4,17,18]. Almost all positive samples demonstrated FLU-A strains, while few FLU-B strains were detected. This result differs from that reported from the United States, which demonstrated that 26% of the positive specimens were influenza B viruses [19]. This discrepancy may in part reflect the epidemic of influenza A virus in North China in 2010-2011. It is possible that FLU-B may not have caused ILI symptoms severe enough for the sufferer to seek medical attention. It is also possible that FLU-B was not circulating in this geographical area during this time. According to the CNIC, Influenza B virus-positive rate was about 1.6% in North China from June 2010 to May 2011 [4]. The percentage of tests that were positive for influenza which included FLU-A and FLU-B was 23.7% which was lower than the same period in 2009 [4,17]. FLU strains, based on our data, accounted for approximately 80% of the RT-PCR positive cases, and in August, September and October 2010, and Mar 2011, all infections were caused by FLU-",

The rate of positive cases of the virus gradually increased from August to October, slowly decreased in November, and then increased again in January 2011. The peak of the positive rate occurred in January 2011 and influenza was the predominant virus between August 2010 and March 2011. Particularly in August, September and October 2010, and March 2011, all infections were caused by FLU only( Figure 1B). The number of positive cases of influenza virus increased rapidly in September and peaked in January 2011, following which it then decreased to normal levels in March 2011. Influenza A(H3) was the predominant viral etiological factor and was only observed from July to December 2010, and again, in January 2011, Influenza A(H3) were replaced by 2009 H1N1. 2009 H1N1 peaked in January 2011. Most influenza viruses were in fact influenza A, with influenza B virus only observed in April 2011. In June, multiple infections predominated. Each identified ILI was caused by a single virus except in June, July and November 2010 and January and February 2011: two FLU-A in August, eight FLU-A in September and in October each, eight FLU-A and one HRCV229E/NL63 in December, four FLU-A in March 2011, one FLU-A, two FLU-B and one ADV in April 2011, No virus was detected in May 2011.
