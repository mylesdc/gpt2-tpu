            "text": "The recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks exemplify the continued threat of (re-)emerging viruses to human health, and our inability to rapidly develop effective therapeutic countermeasures. Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs complicates the development of selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors. We have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the vDUB activity through a rational protein design approach. Here, we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in the case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. Co-crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs, accounting for the observed binding specificity and high affinity. Finally, expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents. Our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies or through transgenic techniques.",

While vaccine-based approaches are desirable in terms of infection prevention in the longer term, alternative antiviral strategies are needed, especially when providing treatment options for infected patients during acute outbreaks. Here we applied protein engineering technology to target virus-encoded deubiquitinating enzymes of two viruses with significant impact on human health: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). This resulted in the rapid identification of ubiquitin variant (UbV) inhibitors that bound with high affinity and specificity to the viral deubiquitinating enzymes. These proteins inhibited the catalytic activities of the deubiquitinating enzymes and almost completely blocked MERS-CoV infection. This work provides proof-of-principle that structurally diverse, virus-specific deubiquitinating enzymes can be selectively targeted through rational protein design technology, and therefore opens new avenues for quickly developed molecularly tailored therapy across a broad spectrum of viral pathogens that infect humans, livestock and plants.",

This process is regulated in part through activity of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove Ub from cellular proteins [1, 2] . Given the essential role of the Ub system in regulating a large number of critical cellular processes, it is not surprising that viruses have acquired the means to modulate this system in order to promote infection and replication in host cells [3] . In particular, virus-encoded DUBs reverse the ubiquitination process to alter host signaling pathways critical to the induction of cellular antiviral and pro-inflammatory innate immune responses [3] . In addition to removing Ub molecules from host proteins, many viral DUBs (vDUBs) also remove the Ub-like protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) to further suppress antiviral responses [4, 5] . Importantly, a number of vDUBs also play an essential role in viral replication [4] [5] [6] . Together, the replicative and/or deubiquitinating activities of viral proteases contribute directly to pathogenesis during viral infection in vivo [7] , making them ideal antiviral drug targets.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) viruses have caused significant concern globally due to their rapid emergence, high lethality rates in humans [8] , and high potential for genetic recombination. Coronaviruses initially express their non-structural proteins (nsps) as large viral polyproteins, which are processed into functional domains by proteases encoded within the polyproteins to establish a viral replication-transcriptase complex. SARS-and MERS-CoV release nsp1-3 through the activity of a papain-like protease (PL pro ) domain situated within nsp3, in a process that is indispensable for replication [4] . The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), corresponding to nsp5, is responsible for cleaving the remaining part of the polyproteins, releasing mature nsps [8] . Strikingly, coronaviral PL pro s also act as vDUBs to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses by targeting cellular Ub-conjugated substrates [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The CoV proteases are well-recognized drug targets, and since the emergence of these zoonotic CoVs research has focused on the identification and development of small molecule inhibitors targeting these enzymes [15, 16] . Another highly pathogenic virus that encodes a vDUB is the nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). The CCHFV vDUB domain is located within the large (L) segment of the genome, and has also been explicitly implicated in the evasion of host Ub-and ISG15-dependent innate immune responses [17] .",

Despite intensive efforts, only a handful of inhibitors targeting vDUB proteases have been reported, and none have been approved for clinical use [24] . To meet this challenge, we have developed a strategy to target the vDUB activity as an antiviral approach by the rapid identification of virus-specific, protein-based vDUB inhibitors from a phage-displayed library of billions of Ub variants (UbVs). The exquisite specificity of identified UbVs has also enabled us to isolate UbVs that potently inhibit human Ub-binding proteins with equally high specificity [25, 26] . Here we describe UbVs that selectively block the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of MERS-CoV and CCHFV OTU vDUB domains. Importantly, UbVs specific for MERS-CoV abolished replicative polyprotein processing activities. Expression of MERS-CoV-specific UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents.",

Within three weeks, UbVs were identified that bound with high affinity to either MERS-CoV PL pro (ME.1 to ME.4) or CCHFV OTU (CC.1 to CC.5) (Fig 1A) . To confirm the specificity of the UbVs towards their cognate vDUBs, the phage-displayed UbVs were challenged against a diverse panel of 11 DUBs from several species representing distinct DUB families (USP, OTU, and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH)). All UbVs bound to their cognate viral proteins but not to any of the 11 additional DUBs (Fig  1B) . To determine the binding affinity of each UbV, phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (S1 Fig) and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) measurements were performed (S2 Table) . Each UbV was found to bind its cognate vDUB with affinities in the low to sub-nanomolar range, whereas wild-type Ub (Ub.wt) showed binding to MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs only in the high micromolar range (S1B Fig and S1 Table) . Consistent with the high affinities observed for the UbVs toward their respective vDUBs, each UbV also potently inhibited the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of MERS-CoV PL pro or CCHFV OTU as measured using the fluorogenic substrates Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC, respectively (Fig 1C and S2  Fig) . The most potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV PL pro and CCHFV OTU were ME.4 (deubiquitination IC 50 = 0.8 nM and deISGlyation IC 50 = 1.2 nM) and CC.4 (deubiquitination IC 50 = 3.3 nM and deISGlyation IC 50 = 11 nM), respectively (S1 Table) . Furthermore, the UbVs were confirmed to inhibit processing of K48-and K63-linked tetra-Ub substrates by their respective vDUBs (Fig 1D) .",

            "text": "To reveal the molecular basis for the inhibition of MERS-CoV PL pro by UbVs, crystal structures of the enzyme were determined bound to ME.2 or ME.4 (Fig 2A and 2B and Table 1 ). Both UbVs bound in nearly identical orientations as Ub.wt (Fig 2C and S3A Fig) with interface surface areas of~1000 \u00c5 2 [9, 27] . Substitutions common to both ME.4 and ME.2 at positions 46, 64 and 70 (Fig 1A) were found to promote more favorable hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme relative to Ub.wt. In comparison to Ub.wt residue Val 70 , UbV residue Ile 70 extends further into a hydrophobic pocket of PL pro formed by residues Thr 1730 \u00c3 and Val 1691 \u00c3 (asterisks denote amino acid numbering of MERS-CoV polyprotein) (Fig 2D) . UbV residue Phe 46 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by PL pro residues Trp 1668 \u00c3 , Glu 1670 \u00c3 , Val 1680 \u00c3 , Leu 1682 \u00c3 , Tyr 1690 \u00c3 and Tyr 1705 \u00c3 , and forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with Arg 1715 \u00c3 (Fig 2E) . These extensive interactions are not formed at the PL pro -Ub.wt interface with the Ub.wt residue Ala 46 . In addition, UbV residue Tyr 64 makes more extensive hydrophobic interactions with Val 1706 \u00c3 and Gly 1710 \u00c3 , compared to Ub.wt residue Glu 64 (Fig 2F) . The UbVs also differ in their C-terminal residues at positions 74, 75 and 77 (Fig 1A) . In ME.4, Asn 74 extends into the active site and forms a hydrogen bonding network with Asp 1645 \u00c3 and Gly 1758 \u00c3 (Fig 2G) , which mimics hydrogen bonds formed by the same region of MERS-CoV PL pro with Ub.wt residues Arg 74 , Gly 75 and Gly 76 (Fig 2H) . In ME.2, Pro 74 cannot form an analogous hydrogen bonding network, which likely contributes to the decreased inhibitory potency of ME.2 compared to ME.4 (Fig 1D and S2A and S2B Fig) . Instead, Pro 74 and the C-terminal tail are excluded from the active site and the main-chains interact through a hydrogen bond formed between the main-chain amide nitrogen of Arg 75 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu 1754 \u00c3 (Fig 2I) . A structural comparison of the C-terminal regions of ME.2 and ME.4 near the PL pro active site is shown in S4 Fig. Additional substitutions in the N-terminal region of ME.4 and ME.2 ( Fig  1A, region 1) do not make favourable contacts with MERS-CoV PL pro , and in fact, residues 8-10 and 7-10 of ME.4 and ME.2, respectively, failed to resolve in electron density maps (S5 Fig). Taken together, our structural analyses revealed that a small subset of substitutions is sufficient to enhance hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bond networks to endow ME.4 and ME.2 with highly potent and specific inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV PL pro .",

CC.2 and CC.4 were bound in the same orientation as Ub.wt with similar buried surface areas of~1000 \u00c5 2 (Fig 3C and S3B Fig) [20, 21] . Interestingly, substitutions in these UbVs were concentrated in the C-terminal region (Fig 1A) and only substitutions at position 68 and downstream were found to interact with the enzyme. In both UbVs, Tyr 68 improves hydrophobic packing with Thr 10 \u00c3 , Val 12 \u00c3 and Val 18 \u00c3 (asterisks The binding specificities of phage-displayed UbVs (y-axis) are shown across a group of 12 DUBs (x-axis), as assessed by phage ELISA. Subsaturating concentrations of phage were added to immobilized proteins as indicated. Bound phages were detected by the addition of anti-M13-HRP and colorimetric development of TMB peroxidase substrate. The mean value of absorbance at 450 nm is shaded in a black-red-yellow gradient. (C) Inhibition of MERS-CoV PL pro (solid lines) or CCHFV OTU (dashed lines) by the cognate UbVs shown as dose-response curves using Ub-AMC (left) or ISG15-AMC (right) as a substrate. The IC 50 value was determined as the concentration of UbV that reduced proteolytic activity by 50% (S1 Table) . The Ub.wt data obtained in the deISGylation assay cannot be fitted by GraphPad Prism so no lines are shown. (D) Effects of UbV inhibitors on vDUB activity against K48/K63 tetra-Ub substrates. Purified MERS-CoV PL pro (top panels) or CCHFV OTU (bottom panels) was incubated with the indicated UbV or Ub.wt (negative control) and biotinylated tetra-Ub at 37\u02daC for a time course of 30 minutes. Western blots were probed with ExtrAvidin-HRP (EA-HRP) to detect biotin-Ub. Inhibition of proteolysis was shown by a delay of appearance of the digestion products tri-Ub (Ub3), di-Ub (Ub2) and mono-Ub (Ub1). denote amino acid numbering of the large segment-encoded protein of CCHFV), relative to His 68 in Ub.wt (Fig 3D) . In CC.2, residue Leu 70 projects further into a hydrophobic cavity in CCHFV OTU formed by residues Val 12 \u00c3 , Ile 14 \u00c3 , Val 18 \u00c3 and Ile 131 \u00c3 , than does the equivalent Ub. wt residue Val 70 (Fig 3E) . The conformational freedom of a Gly substitution at position 74 enables the C-terminal tail of each UbV to form numerous favorable interactions with the enzyme. Residues Gly 75 and Val 75 of CC.2 and CC.4, respectively, occupy space on the CCHFV OTU surface, which in the case of Ub.wt is occupied by the side-chain of Arg 74 (Fig  3E-3G) . This alternative conformation permitted by Gly 74 in CC.2 and CC.4 allows the sidechain of Trp 76 or Trp 77 of CC.2 or CC.4, respectively, to pack within different adjacent grooves near the CCHFV OTU active site, with Trp 76 of CC.2 forming a cation-\u03c0 interaction with Arg 92 \u00c3 (Fig 3E) , and the amide nitrogen group of CC.4 residue Trp 77 forming a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln 149 \u00c3 (Fig 3F) . Conversely, Trp 71 in both CC.2 and CC.4 does not interact with CCHFV OTU, but instead packs into a hydrophobic cavity within each UbV (Fig 3E and 3F) . Differences between the orientations of the C-terminal tails of CC.2 and CC.4 arise from the variation at positions 75 and 76. In CC.4, residue Val 75 packs against CCHFV OTU residue Trp 99 \u00c3 , and Pro 76 appears to restrict conformational freedom and enable hydrophobic interactions with Trp 99 \u00c3 and Thr 150 \u00c3 (Fig 3F) . Together with the packing orientation of Trp 77 , these additional contacts likely account for the high binding affinity of CC.4 for CCHFV OTU (S2 Table) .",

            "text": "To explore the effects of UbVs on MERS-CoV PL pro activity in cells, deubiquitination assays were performed by transfecting cells with combinations of plasmids encoding the following proteins: HA-tagged Ub (which becomes conjugated to cellular proteins), MERS-CoV PL pro , and UbVs (which are unconjugatable due to substitutions in the C-terminal di-Gly motif). A clear decrease of cellular HA-Ub conjugates was observed during co-expression of MERS-CoV PL pro , while there was no effect upon expression of a catalytically inactive mutant (Fig 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The co-expression of increasing doses of different UbVs attenuated MERS-CoV PL pro DUB activity to varying degrees (Fig 4A and S6A Fig) . In a dose-dependent manner, ME.4 co-expression resulted in severe inhibition of HA-Ub deconjugation mediated by MERS-CoV PL pro , whereas co-expression of an unconjugatable form of Ub.wt as a negative control (Ub.AA, which contains Gly75Ala and Gly76Ala substitutions) had no effect on the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PL pro at any dose (Fig 4A, compare lanes 5-7 to 8-10). Like ME.4, ME.2 had a strong effect resulting in near complete inhibition of MERS-CoV PL pro DUB activity at the lowest UbV dose, whereas the inhibitory effect of ME.1 and ME.3 was apparent only at higher UbV doses (S6A Fig). Notably, none of the UbVs inhibited the DUB activity of the closely related SARS-CoV PL pro , highlighting their specificity for MERS-CoV PL pro (S7A Fig). A superposition of ME.4 onto the Ub domain of a previously determined SARS-CoV-Ub complex suggests that Phe 46 and Ile 70 of ME.4 clash with Val 188 \u00c3 and Met 209 \u00c3 of SARS-CoV PL pro , respectively, and offers a plausible explanation for the specificity of ME.2 and ME.4 toward MERS-COV PL pro (S8 Fig) .",

Significance relative to wild-type without expression of a UbV was calculated using an unpaired two-tailed Student's binding to MERS-CoV PL pro resulting in an alleviated suppression of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig 4B and S6B Fig) . Consistent with described binding and inhibition data, ME.2 and ME.4 were more potent than ME.1 and ME.3 at blocking the ability of MERS-CoV PL pro to suppress IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, whereas none of the UbVs were able to block suppression of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity by SARS-CoV PL pro (S7B Fig). The UbVs thus prevented MERS-CoV PL pro -mediated suppression of cellular anti-viral innate immune responses, and in a remarkably selective, virus-specific manner.",

In order to assess the ability of UbVs to inhibit MERS-CoV PL pro -mediated polyprotein processing activity, an in trans cleavage assay was performed [9] . FLAG-tagged UbVs and V5-tagged MERS-CoV PL pro were co-expressed with N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally V5-tagged nsp3C-4 (HA-nsp3C-4-V5), a fragment of the viral polyprotein encompassing the C-terminal part of nsp3 (excluding the PL pro domain) and nsp4. In trans cleavage of the nsp3#4 junction is indicative of proteolytic activity of PL pro during infection [9] . MERS-CoV PL pro efficiently cleaved HA-nsp3C-4-V5 into HA-nsp3C and nsp4-V5 products, whereas the active site mutant did not (Fig 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4) . The cleavage of the nsp3#4 site was not affected upon expression of the negative control Ub.AA, whereas only a fraction of HA-nsp3C-4-V5 was cleaved upon expression of ME.4 or ME.2 at the lowest dose, and cleavage was completely blocked at higher UbV doses (Fig 4C compare lanes 5-7 to 8-10, S6C Fig) .",

MRC5 and HuH-7 cell lines were transduced with lentiviruses encoding FLAGtagged UbVs, Ub.AA, or GFP. Efficient expression of FLAG-ME.1 and GFP in these cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and by western blotting (S9 Fig). Either 32 or 48 hours post-transduction, cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, and MERS-CoV titers were determined from supernatants harvested 32 hours post infection (Fig 4D) . In MRC5 cells, ME.1 and ME.4 expression resulted in significantly lower virus titers as these dropped from 5 x 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml recovered from control cells to 1,000 or 10 PFU/ml, respectively, when the MERS-CoV infection was started 32 hours posttransduction (Fig 4D) . The effect of the UbVs was even more pronounced in MRC5 cells that were infected with MERS-CoV 48 hours post-transduction, as virus titers dropped below 10 PFU/ml upon expression of ME.4, which represented a reduction in infectious progeny titers of more than four orders of magnitude (Fig 4D) and correlated with higher expression of the t test and significant values were indicated: ** p < 0.01. Bars represent mean and error bars represent S.D. (C) Proteolytic cleavage capability of MERS-CoV PL pro was assessed in the presence of the UbVs. N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally V5-tagged nsp3C-4 (excluding the PL pro domain) was coexpressed with V5-tagged MERS-CoV PL pro -V5 (wild type or the active site mutant C), FLAG-ME-UbV (with increasing doses) and GFP (as a transfection control). Cells were lysed 18 hours post transfection and proteolytic cleavage activity was assessed by western blotting to detect generation of N-terminal HA-tagged nsp3C and C-terminal V5-tagged nsp4 cleavage products. (D) MERS-CoV titers of collected supernatants from lentivirus transduced and, subsequently, MERS-CoV infected MRC5 cells. MRC-5 cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding FLAG-UbVs, FLAG-Ub.AA or GFP (latter two as controls) and, either 32 hours or 48 hours post-transduction, the cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After another 32 hours, culture supernatants were harvested and MERS-CoV titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. Significant difference relative to MERS-CoV titers from lentivirus transduced MRC5 cells expressing Ub.AA is indicated: * p<0.05. Bars represent mean and error bars represent S.D. UbVs at this time point (S9 Fig and S10 Fig). In HuH-7 cells the expression of GFP or Ub.AA did not affect MERS-CoV titers compared to the non-transduced cells, whereas ME.1 expression led to a two orders of magnitude reduction in virus titer, and an even greater reduction of more than three orders of magnitude was observed upon ME.4 expression (S11 Fig). The effect of UbVs on MERS-CoV progeny titers was more severe in MRC5 cells compared to HuH-7 cells, which might be due to generally higher expression of UbVs in MRC5 cells than in HuH-7 cells (Fig 4D, S9B Fig and S11 Fig). Taken together, these studies show that UbVs readily inhibit the proteolytic activities of MERS-CoV PL pro in cells and provide extremely effective protection from MERS-CoV infection.",

However, progress continues to be made on methods for intracellular delivery of mRNA or proteins [30] [31] [32] , and strategies to reduce immunogenicity, including the use of mirror-image proteins [33] , have been developed. Thus, in the future, we are hopeful that UbVs may become bona fide drug candidates, but at present, they are best viewed as tool compounds that can enable drug discovery. For example, while the interface between the UbVs and vDUBs is large, we have recently used combinatorial mutagenesis to reveal a smaller site on human USPs within the UbV interaction interface, which may be amenable as a target for small-molecule inhibitor design [34] . Indeed, while the design of small molecules that target protein-protein interfaces remains challenging, there are successful examples where polypeptide-based tools have facilitated design and screening of small molecule inhibitors [35] .",

            "text": "The utilization of the Ub scaffold as a template for vDUB inhibitor development exploits the large Ub-binding interface to provide a high degree of specificity in comparison to small molecule-based approaches, since the latter usually rely on targeting the active site of the viral protease, thereby invoking the risk of cross-reactivity with cellular proteases. The amino acid substitutions in UbVs that confer potent inhibition of vDUBs are distributed across relatively large binding interfaces, and we speculate that resistance to UbVs is less likely to develop in comparison to small-molecule inhibitors. The larger binding surface and the much tighter binding affinities of UbVs (low to sub-nanomolar, Fig 1C) compared to reported micromolar affinities for small-molecule inhibitors of MERS-CoV PL pro [52] imply that rather extensive mutations in the viral protease will be necessary to efficiently repel the UbV. Since development of resistance mutations requires virus replication, the extreme reduction in MERS-CoV progeny titers upon expression of UbVs during infection is therefore expected to severely delay occurrence of resistance. Additionally, if a resistant virus happens to be already present in the quasi species it is likely that mutations to repel the UbV from the vDUB will concomitantly lead to less optimal binding of the viral protease to Ub/ISG15 itself and maybe even the virus replicase polyproteins. Therefore, the resistant virus is expected to be attenuated and to have at least reduced deubiquitinating/deISGylating activity that is important for the virus' capacity to suppress host innate immune responses [9, 53] . This idea is supported by described escape mutants for MHV to a broad-spectrum CoV 3C-like protease inhibitor where the inhibitor-resistant virus was attenuated in mice, highlighting that the mutant was generated at the cost of replicative fitness [54] In future experiments we will experimentally assess the development of UbV resistance during infection in cell culture and mouse models, which will show whether our speculations are correct.",

Afterwards, five rounds of selections using the phage-displayed UbV library were performed against immobilized proteins including the following steps: (a) Each phage particle in the library pool displays a unique UbV and encapsulates the encoding DNA; (b) Binding phages are captured with an immobilized protein; (c) Non-binding phages are washed away; and (d) Bound phages are amplified by infection of bacteria. The enriched phage pool is cycled through additional rounds of selection to further enrich for protein-binding UbVs. After the fifth round of binding selections, individual phages with improved binding properties were identified by phage ELISA using established techniques and subjected to DNA sequencing of the phagemids to obtain UbV sequences [26, 55] .",

The wt Ub data obtained in the deISGylation assay can not be fitted by GraphPad Prism so no lines were shown. Residues are shown as spheres, with SARS-CoV PL pro residues indicated with asterisks and in italics. SARS-CoV PL pro residue M209 clashed with ME.4 residue I70, compared with Ub residue V70 (C). (D) SARS-CoV PL pro residues E204 and V188 clash with ME.4 residues Q48 and V188, respectively, compared to Ub.wt residues K48 and A46 (E). . Relative expression of GFP and FLAG-ME.1 was quantified and normalized to actin and expression levels in MRC5 cells 48 h pt were set at 100%. (C) GFP transduced MRC5 and HuH-7 cells were fixed 32 h or 48 h pt and nuclear DNA was stained using Hoechst. Images were taken using fixed exposure times for both the GFP and Hoechst signal. (D) Immunofluorescence assay of FLAG-ME.1-transduced MRC5 and HuH-7 cells that were fixed 32 h or 48 h pt. Cells were labelled with a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing FLAG followed by labelling with a secondary Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Exposure times were kept the same for each image. ",
