Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system a for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system a can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter.

Procedures-Reports from the software system a containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. Results-Comparisons between the software system a reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software system's age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system a was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-data currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. Relevant data points, i.e., health status at intake and outcome, vaccination date and status, as well as age, should be made mandatory to facilitate more useful data collection and reporting.",

            "text": "Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial disease syndrome endemic in many animal shelters. Upper respiratory infections disseminate readily in the shelter environment. Acute URI often develops shortly after arrival to a shelter and is responsible for a significant loss of well-being for shelter cats. Chronic URI disease can develop in cats secondary to acute disease and may cause long-term health and welfare problems for the adopted cat [1] . Caring for cats with URI can create a significant financial drain on shelter resources and in some circumstances URI can even be considered a potentially \"fatal disease\": many cats suffering from the condition are euthanized due to the risk of disease transmission to other shelter cats, the resources required to care for affected cats, and the reduced potential for affected cats to be adopted [2] . Developing effective management strategies to control feline URI is largely dependent on the availability and quality of data collection and must take into consideration both environmental and host factors. Several studies in animal shelters and catteries have shown that the risk factors for developing URI include age, number of days in the shelter, level of hygiene and larger number of cats [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

In order to permit recommendations tailored to an individual shelter population, data collection must be consistent and ongoing. Research methods employed to date for tracking URI in shelter cats have been prohibitively time intensive to permit routine use on an ongoing basis [4, 5] . Resources for record-keeping in animal shelters are often limited and shelter managers may be uncertain as to what data are most pertinent. Shelter data collection systems have historically focused on intake and outcome information or individual animal tracking, resulting in a lack of useful data to tailor disease control programs, measure impacts of protocols or prevent misallocation of resources [6] . However, if data currently entered into existing software systems could be used to track risk factors and disease outcomes on a consistent basis, appropriate herd data collection and analysis in animal shelters should be possible without imposing a significant extra time burden on shelter staff.",

URI was diagnosed by the observer based on the presence of any of the following clinical signs: sneezing, clear or colored nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, or ulcers/sores on the nose, lips, tongue or gums.

Due to the structure and data available in the inventory reports of this particular software program it is more cumbersome to use these reports to track time until onset of URI, or for planning of staffing and housing need according to expected daily admission, rather than the easily available intake reports.

The appearance of adult canine teeth is expected to occur at approximately five months of age and provides a practical and readily observed indicator for shelter staff to determine a cutoff point between age groups; hence this was used as the definition of kitten versus adults in this study. If shelter staff have insufficient training or time to accurately make age assessments, this may result in misclassification no matter how consistently data is entered and tracked. Tracking age as a risk factor for URI at the study shelter was complicated by the fact that the age field in the software system a had been made an optional data point while size was made mandatory. This was done as a result of external criticism that the shelter staff was not sufficiently trained to estimate age of kittens and thus entered incorrect age estimates. The shelter staff reported that they would enter adult cats as medium or large on the size field, while kittens were reported as small, however, there was evidently confusion about this practice.

However, most confusion regarding age is likely to arise in cats close to the five month cut off. Most cats fall well on either side of this cut off and are readily classified as adults or kittens by even casual observation. Therefore the bulk of disparity most likely arose from issues related to using the \"size\" field as a substitute for age. If kittens were medium or large for their age, then they may have been classified as such in the size field, while the same may have been true for the adult cats classified by shelter staff as \"small\". The data would have been more useful if staff estimated age rather than using animal size as the software system a will automatically update the age field with the passage of time, and a kitten would automatically be reclassified as adult when reaching the age of 5 months.

Only slightly more than half of the software system a generated reports on vaccination status were complete and accurate, rendering this data point useless for evaluating this important factor. An important contributor to the poor data performance may have been that there was no option in the software system a to record a cat as not vaccinated. Assuming that a blank vaccine status field in the software system a meant that no vaccine was given resulted in a substantial increase in complete records from the 52% to 92%.

In regards to cats without signs of URI and not receiving any medical treatment that had a URI diagnosis in the software system a it is possible these were entered by staff other than the veterinary staff so that they could be evaluated for mild signs of URI that subsequently disappeared. If the URI diagnosis was not removed when the veterinary staff evaluated the animal as healthy and not in need of any treatment this would be counted as false positives. We also acknowledge that using the observer's diagnosis as the gold standard for the URI diagnosis is problematic. The observer spent on average 1 min observing every cat on each day and it is probable that some of the cats suffering from mild or moderate URI, and reported as such in the software system a , did not display any of the clinical signs during the limited time it was being observed, resulting in false negatives.
