Result. ere were 7 cases of illness, and the attack rate was 46.67%. e onset date was concentrated on May 9 and 10. All cases were found in the tour group, and no cases occurred in the nontour group. e results of this retrospective cohort study showed that the consumption of boiled eggs for breakfast on May 9 was a common factor (R 2 \ufffd 6.67, P \ufffd 0.023). Salmonella enteritidis was identified from the patients' stool and vomit. Conclusion. e food poisoning epidemic was caused by Salmonella enteritidis. In the summer and autumn, attention should be paid to preservation, processing, and cooking of food to avoid bacterial contamination. To prevent sickness, travelers should know the disease prevalence at their destinations in advance.",

When a food poisoning outbreak occurs, it should be stopped in time to prevent further spread. is survey provides a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea during travelling. Dubai belongs to the Eastern Mediterranean. According to reports in the literature, over 125,000 deaths (3.6% of total deaths) in the Eastern Mediterranean region in 2013 were due to diarrheal diseases, with a greater burden of diarrheal diseases in low-and middleincome countries. Diarrhea-associated deaths per 100,000 children under 5 years of age ranged from one (95% uncertainty interval (UI) \ufffd 0-1) in Bahrain and Oman to 471 (95% UI \ufffd 245-763) in Somalia [14] . erefore, diarrhea in the area should be given attention.",

With the acceleration of globalization, the exchanges between people in various countries have gradually increased, and food poisoning is spreading quickly across borders.
