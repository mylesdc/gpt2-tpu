However, the activity of this medicine against enteroviral infections has not been investigated. The water-extract of dried buds of D. genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. (DGFW) was examined against various strains of enterovirus 71 (EV71) by neutralization assay, and its initial mode of action was characterized by time-of-addition assay followed by attachment and penetration assays. Pretreatment of DGFW with virus abolished viral replication, indicating that DGFW inhibits EV71 by targeting the virus. GFW exerts its anti-EV71 effects by inhibiting viral entry without producing cytotoxic side effects and thus provides a potential agent for antiviral chemotherapeutics.",

It is a member of the Picornaviridae family and has a (+)RNA genome 7.5 kb in length that encodes 2193 amino acids [1, 2] . The polyprotein is cleaved proteolytically into distinct proteins by the viral-encoded proteases 2A pro and 3C pro . The structural proteins comprising VP1 to VP4 and the nonstructural proteins 2A to 2C and 3A to 3D are required for viral replication [2] . EV71 is a common enterovirus that usually causes hand, foot and mouth disease in children but is often associated with brainstem encephalitis, neurogenic shock and polio-like acute flaccid paralysis. EV71 caused an outbreak with 78 mortalities in 1998, with manifestations of neurological involvement and cardiopulmonary failure. In a long-term study, survivors of EV71-induced CNS infection were found to have neurological sequelae and retarded mental development [3] . Several epidemics occurred and caused a total of 51 fatalities in 2000-2001 [4] . Unfortunately, there is no therapy with proven efficacy to control EV71. Given these recurring outbreaks and annual epidemics, there is a clear need to develop inhibitors for EV71.",

            "text": "We have been identifying traditional Chinese medicines with antiviral or prophylactic activity against EV71 infections [8, 9] . The flower buds of Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. (Thymelaeaceae), known as Won-Hwa or Yuanhua in Chinese, are collected in the spring before blossoming. As a traditional medicine, they have been used as an abortifacient [10] , with purgative, diuretic and anti-inflammatory actions [11] . Previous phytochemical studies on D. genkwa have led to the isolation of pharmacologically active flavonoids, diterpene orthoesters and coumarins, showing inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase and adenosine 3\uf0a2,5\uf0a2-cyclic monophosphate phosphodiesterase, as well as exhibiting antileukemic activity [12] . In the present study, we used Chinese traditional medicine extracts for anti-EV71 activity. We found that Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. extracts (DGFW) could neutralize the EV71-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in human embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. The half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of DGFW on EV71 was approximately 0.163 \u00b1 0.013 mg/mL. DGFW inhibited EV71 viral protein and viral RNA synthesis. Additionally, DGFW suppressed viral activity at the adsorption stage of uptake as shown by a time-of-addition assay. Cells pretreated with DGFW could not block viral infection. Therefore, it is possible that DGFW binds to the virus to affect its activity. We conclude that DGFW possesses antiviral activity and has the potential for development as an anti-EV71 agent.",

            "text": "In an endeavor to identify anti-EV71 Chinese medicines, we initially screened a panel of 48 extracts of Chinese herbs with antioxidant properties. An assay to measure the inhibition of virus-induced cell death in RD cells was first employed using 1 mg/mL of herbal extracts followed by EC 50 determination if the candidates possessed antiviral activity from the primary screening. We identified that the water fraction of D. genkwa was a potent agent against EV71 isolate 2231 with an EC 50 of 0.163 \u00b1 0.013 mg/mL and a concentration producing 50% cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) of 1.444 \u00b1 0.193 mg/mL using RD cells (Table 1) . However, its solvent (CHCl 3 ) layer did not demonstrate anti-EV71 activity ( Figure 1) . DGFW was also able to inhibit successfully other isolates of EV71 except for isolate 1101 (genotype B5; Table 1 ). Interestingly, this extract was effective against influenza virus, although the selectivity index was not satisfactory. However, DGFW did not show activity against CVs or two DNA viruses, adenovirus and HSV-1, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL (Table 1) . The preparation of DGFW is shown in Figure 1 and the final dried extract was weighed and dissolved in DMSO for antiviral analysis. We explored the effects of DGFW in protecting against virus-induced CPE on RD cells by microscopic assay (Figure 2 ). The RD cells were infected with EV71 isolate 2231 in the presence or absence of 0.5 mg/mL, which was not toxic to the cells by MTT assay ( Figure S1 ). RD cells infected with virus displayed a typical CPE in which the cells became rounded and eventually detached from the culture dish (panel D, Figure 2 ). This effect was not caused by DGFW alone (panel B, Figure 2 ) or 0.25% vehicle DMSO (panel C, Figure 2 ). DGFW but not DMSO protected the cells from virus-induced CPE (panel E versus F, Figure 2 ), indicating that DGFW inhibited viral replication. We therefore performed qPCR and western blotting to confirm the antiviral effect of DGFW ( Figure 3 ). The cells were first infected with virus in the presence or absence of DGFW and the cells were harvested at indicated points ( Figure 3A ). The amount of viral RNA was quantified against a standard curve of known concentrations. The synthesis of viral protein was measured as viral proteins 3A and 3C. DGFW substantially reduced the synthesis of viral RNA and viral proteins ( Figure 3B ,C). ",

DGFW was either added before viral preadsorption, during adsorption (-1 to 0 h p.i.), or after viral adsorption. The viruses from cells and culture medium were then collected for plaque assay at 10 h p.i. ( Figure 4B ). DGFW was able to reduce viral titer considerably during the viral preadsorption step between \u22121 and 0 h p.i. (lane 4, Figure 4 ). DGFW did not target the cells when it was added before viral preadsorption (lanes 1-3, Figure 4B ). The late stages, such as viral package and release, were not inhibited by DGFW because no reduction of viral titer was seen when the extract was added immediately after viral adsorption (lanes 6-8, Figure 4B ). Altogether, these results demonstrate that DGFW might target cellular uptake of the virus. DGFW (0.5 mg/mL) was added at the designated times. (b) Viral adsorption was from \u22121 to 0 h p.i. on ice. DGFW (0.5 mg/mL in E2) was added to the cells at the indicated times. After each treatment, DGFW was washed and replaced with fresh E2.

Viral uptake into cells occurs first by binding to receptors followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis into early endosomes [13] . The attachment assay was used to examine the binding of the virus to receptors, and the penetration assay was used to test the entry step following receptor binding. We used HFF3 cells for these assays because RD cells were easily detached from the dishes when incubated on ice, and HFF3 cells are susceptible to EV71 infection [14] . For the attachment assay, the HFF3 cells were incubated with 100 TCID 50 of EV71 for 3 h in the presence of DGFW on ice. The cytoprotection of DGFW was then determined. DGFW was able to inhibit attachment of EV71 into HFF3 cells with an EC 50 of 0.185 \u00b1 0.056 mg/mL ( Figure 5A ). For the penetration assay, DGFW was added during viral entry into cells at 37 \u00b0C following viral preadsorption. DGFW was also able to inhibit penetration with an IC 50 of 0.245 \u00b1 0.063 mg/mL ( Figure 5B ). DGFW might bind to and thus inhibit the virus, because DGFW displayed a similar IC 50 against EV71 based on attachment and penetration assays. ",

Similarly, EV71 was pretreated with DGFW or DMSO for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and the infectivity of the treated virus was then determined by plaque assay (Figure 6 ). Pretreatment of cells with DGFW did not show any reduction of viral titer, suggesting that DGFW did not affect viral binding to the cells directly. In contrast, pretreatment of the virus with DGFW caused a substantial reduction of viral titer, but this was not seen after treatment with DMSO alone, implying that DGFW might target the virus directly and specifically ( Figure 6 ; lane 3 versus lane 4). This result was consistent with the time-of-addition assay (Figure 4 ). This direct targeting effect was further demonstrated by a lower concentration of DGFW. This was done by pretreating the virus with DGFW for 30 min followed by diluting the mixture 10 5 -fold, whereby the DGFW did not have inhibitory activity. The infectivity of the treated virus was then determined by plaque assay (Figure 6B ).

Many antienteroviral agents against poliovirus or rhinovirus have been thus tested for their efficacy against EV71. Pleconaril, a WIN compound and in clinical development, has been reported to inhibit several types of enterovirus-induced meningitis and aseptic meningitis [15] . The WIN series of compounds inhibit viral replication primarily by binding the hydrophobic canyon region of capsid protein VP1 to stabilize the viral capsid structure, so that after the virus enters the host cell it cannot undergo the uncoating process [16] . However, Pleconaril did not effectively inhibit the CPE induced in cell cultures by the EV71 strain isolated from patients who had contracted hand, foot and mouth disease in 1998 [17] . We demonstrated here that DGFW might target the viral particle for inhibition. However, DGFW did not show strong binding activity to the virus in a filter assay, suggesting that DGFW acts through transient binding but leads on to potent inhibitory activity ( Figure S2 ).",

However, the EC 50 of DGFW against EV71/TW/1101/08 (subgenotype B5) was greater than 1 mg/mL, but this dose was equivalent to the effective cytotoxic concentration and therefore cannot be considered as having an inhibitory effect. We demonstrated that DGFW targets the virus to inhibit the attachment and entry steps. However, DGFW did not inhibit the B5 subgenotype, and this can be explained by the demonstrated differences in VP1 sequences [19] . The phylogenetic analysis showed distinct differences between CV-B and EV71, and consequently DGFW did not inhibit CV-B1 to B5 as expected (Table 1) . Additionally, as DGFW appears to inhibit different genotypes of EV71 to different degrees, this might explain why DGFW does not target cellular factor(s).",

Apigenin showed a strong inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase [21] , as well as against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus [23] [24] [25] . Luteolin and its glycosides have been widely used for their antimicrobial properties, and HBV, SARS-CoV and the influenza virus can be inhibited as shown by in vitro studies [24] [25] [26] . However, no anti-EV71 activity of flavonoids isolated from D. genkwa has been demonstrated. Interestingly, similar to our findings, apigenin was able to inhibit the influenza virus but did not show antiviral activity against HSV (Table 1) [23, 24, 27] . The examination of anti-EV71 activities of apigenin and other purified compounds from D. genkwa is ongoing. On a cautionary note, Daphne bud extracts, whether from the ether layer or the water layer, can also induce early antigen expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [28] . Up to 90% of the world's human population has a latent EBV infection, and it has a high association with nasopharyngeal carcinomas in southeast Asia and certain other countries [29] . In addition, D. genkwa possesses the harmful side effect of abortifacient activity. Thus, there is a need to isolate the effective anti-EV71 ingredients that do not lead to the induction of EBV early antigen production or act as abortifacients. (Table 1 ) [30] . Influenza virus A/WSN/33 was obtained from the American Type Cell Culture and was amplified accordingly [30] . Overnight cultures of monolayers of RD cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) before being inoculated with EV71 or CV-B at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.01. The cells and culture supernatants containing viral progeny were collected when cells developed a CPE of ~80%. The progeny viruses inside the cells were released by three cycles of freezing-thawing, and the resulting viral suspension was pooled with the culture medium, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.",
