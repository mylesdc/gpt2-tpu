            "text": "Mutations of SLC26A4 are among the most prevalent causes of hereditary deafness. Deafness in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4 2/2 , results from an abnormally enlarged cochlear lumen. The goal of this study was to determine whether the cochlear enlargement originates with defective cochlear fluid transport or with a malfunction of fluid transport in the connected compartments, which are the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac. Embryonic inner ears from Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice were examined by confocal microscopy ex vivo or after 2 days of organ culture. Culture allowed observations of intact, ligated or partially resected inner ears. Cochlear lumen formation was found to begin at the base of the cochlea between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and 14.5. Enlargement was immediately evident in Slc26a4 2/2 compared to Slc26a4 +/2 mice. In Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice, separation of the cochlea from the vestibular labyrinth by ligation at E14.5 resulted in a reduced cochlear lumen. Resection of the endolymphatic sacs at E14.5 led to an enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4 +/2 mice but caused no further enlargement of the already enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4 2/2 mice. Ligation or resection performed later, at E17.5, did not alter the cochlea lumen. In conclusion, the data suggest that cochlear lumen formation is initiated by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth and temporarily controlled by fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac. Failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac due to lack of Slc26a4 expression appears to initiate cochlear enlargement in mice, and possibly humans, lacking functional Slc26a4 expression.

Particularly in Chinese populations, mutations of SLC26A4 are found in as many as 13.7% of deaf subjects [5] . Phenotypes associated with mutations of SLC26A4 include deafness at birth as well as fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness during childhood [6, 7, 8] . The compatibility of SLC26A4 mutations with hearing, although limited to early childhood, provides the imperative to investigate the etiology of SLC26A4 related deafness with the ultimate goal to develop strategies to preserve hearing in afflicted individuals. Toward this goal, the first mouse model, Slc26a4 2/2 (formerly named Pds 2/2 ), had been developed [9] . Studies using this mouse model have mainly focused on the postnatal development since normal mice acquire hearing during the second postnatal week and since most human patients lose hearing during early childhood. Three synergistic pathophysiological pathways have so far been delineated.",

Conceptually, the enlargement could be the result of a net increase in fluid secretion or decrease in absorption. Pendrin itself does not mediate net solute transport, since it transports anions with a stoichiometry of 1:1 [16] . Whether and how pendrin contributes to fluid secretion or absorption is unknown.

The colony was maintained free of known and suspected murine Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice ranging from E11.5 to P7 were used for the present study. Time-pregnant dams were deeply anesthetized with 4% tri-bromo-ethanol and sacrificed by decapitation after harvesting embryos by sterile laparotomy. Gestational age was counted from the day, when a vaginal plug was detected. This day was set to embryonic (E) day 0.5 (E0.5). Gestational age, however, was verified, and in rare cases corrected, by evaluating gross morphological features including limbs, digits, and appearance of the pinna and auditory meatus [19, 20] . Neonatal mice (P0-P3) were anesthetized by a combination of i.p. injection of 0.013 ml/g body weight of 4% tri-bromo-ethanol and rapid cooling on an ice slush. Older mice (P5-P7) were anesthetized solely by i.p. injection of 0.013 ml/g body weight of 4% tri-bromo-ethanol. Embryos and postnatal mice were sacrificed by decapitation. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kansas State University (IACUC#: 2613).",

The enlargement of the cochlear lumen at E14.5 is therefore unlikely due to local cochlear fluid transport. The relationship been the onset of expression and the onset of cochlear enlargement suggests an involvement of the endolymphatic sac. A reduction in fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac presents a conceivable reason for the enlargement of the cochlear lumen.

Investigations of the endolymphatic sac are hampered by the difficulty of access and the heterogeneity of the epithelium, which consists principally of ribosome-rich cells with interspersed mitochondrial-rich cells [28] . Nevertheless, a number of ion transporters have been identified. These include apical Na + channels [29, 30] , apical H + ATPase subunits [23, 31, 32] , basolateral Na + /K + ATPases [33] , basolateral Na + /H + exchangers [34, 35] and apical as well as basolateral Cl 2 / HCO 3 2 exchangers including pendrin [11, 23, 31] .

It is intriguing to speculate that the heterogenic epithelium of the endolymphatic sac resembles a frog skin in that it engages in H + ATPase-driven Na + reabsorption. Frog skin is comprised of principal cells equipped with apical Na + channels and mitochondria-rich cells equipped with an apical H + ATPase and a Cl 2 /HCO 3 2 exchanger. Highly effective Na + absorption is powered by the H + ATPase, which generates a current that drives Na + absorption through the Na + channels [37] . The role of the Cl 2 /HCO 3 2 exchangers is this model is to export HCO 3 2 that is generated by carbonic anhydrase in the process of generating H + as substrate for the H + ATPase (Fig. 10) . Lack of the Cl 2 /HCO 3 exchanger pendrin would inhibit H + production by carbonic anhydrase through product-inhibition and a reduce the current that drives Na + reabsorption.",

The loss of control of cochlea fluid homeostasis by the endolymphatic sac may be the result of the maturation of local cochlear fluid homeostasis. Further, the capacity for Na + reabsorption in the endolymphatic sac may be higher at E14.5 than at E17. Support for this hypothesis comes from the finding that numbers of mRNA copies coding for the three subunits of the Na + channel ENaC decline from P2 to P6 of early postnatal development, which is ,4 days after E17 [29] . It is conceivable that this decline can be extrapolated to the embryonic phase of development.",

A base-to-apex gradient in developmental maturation is consistent with the cochlea developing from an elongating protrusion of the otocyst, which implies that cells near the base are developmentally more mature than cells at the apex. Cochlear lumen formation could thus be due to a base-to-apex progressing onset of local fluid transport. Alternatively, lumen formation could be aided by the vestibular labyrinth, which matures earlier than the cochlea. For example, the onset of mechanotransduction in vestibular hair cells is at E17, which is ,4 days earlier than in the cochlea [38, 39] . The observation that ligation of the vestibular labyrinth caused a reduction of the cochlear lumen at E14.5 but not at E17.5 suggests that cochlear lumen formation is transiently aided by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth. Fluid secretion in the embryonic cochlea or vestibular labyrinth is poorly understood. Mechanism of ion transport, that are well established in the postnatal cochlea, cannot be extrapolated to the embryonic stage since the adult ion composition of the luminal fluid, which is characterized by a high K + concentration and low Na + and Ca 2+ concentrations, is established only during postnatal development [12, 17, 18] . Nevertheless, the observation that ligation of the vestibular labyrinth led to a reduction in the cochlear lumen in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice suggests that pendrin does not play a major role in fluid secretion in the embryonic vestibular labyrinth.",

Gap junction mediated signaling between epithelial cells, for example, may be compromised by increased diffusional distances that are inherent to stretched epithelial cells enclosing an enlarged lumen (Fig. 1B) . The importance of gap junction mediated cell signaling is underlined by the fact that loss-offunction mutations of the gap junction protein connexin 26 cause deafness at birth. Coincidentally, mutations of connexin 26 are the most frequent cause for non-syndromic hearing loss in children [40, 41] . Further, the enlargement may disrupt signaling between mesenchymal and epithelial cells as shown in the early postnatal cochlea where mesenchymal cells generate thyroid hormone by conversion of the prohormone to the hormone and epithelial cells bear the thyroid hormone receptors that control proper maturation of the cochlea [42, 43, 44, 45] . The enlargement of the cochlea lumen in Slc26a4 2/2 mice displaces mesenchymal cells and thereby disrupts cell signaling, which leads to local cochlear hypothyroidism during the early postnatal phase of development [10] . Taken together, cell-to-cell signaling is critically important during development of the cochlea. The enlargement appears to disrupt critical cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms at multiple stages, thereby disrupt proper development and account for deafness at birth in mice and possibly human patients.",

The majority of patients bearing mutations of SLC26A4 lose hearing during early childhood -often after a period of fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness [8, 46] . Based on studies in the Slc26a4 2/2 mouse model, fluctuating hearing loss may be due to oscillations of a negative feedback system that oscillates and generates fluctuations in the endocochlear potential and thereby in the driving force on which hearing depends. This feedback loop is comprised of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by marginal cells of stria vascularis as a byproduct of elevated rates of K + secretion and the ROS-sensitive K + channel KCNJ10 that generates the endocochlear potential and supplies K + to the marginal cells [12, 13] . The ROS-induced loss of KCNJ10 abolishes the endocochlear potential and hearing and the associated reduction in K + flux to marginal cells would limit K + secretion, reduce ROS production, allow restoration of KCNJ10 expression, restoration of the endocochlear potential and restoration of hearing. This feedback loop may oscillate and thereby generate fluctuating hearing loss. Irreversible deafness would ensue, when endolymphatic Ca 2+ concentrations rise and hair cells succumb to Ca 2+ overload [9, 12] . Figure 9 .

            "text": "In summary, the present study demonstrates that a lack of functional Slc26a4 expression leads to a failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac that initiate cochlear enlargement in mice, and possibly humans. It is conceivable that deafness in mice, and possible humans, is a direct consequence of the cochlear enlargement and inherent disruption of cell signaling and cochlear ion homeostasis. Figure S1 Cochlear lumen formation in Slc26a4+/2 and Slc26a42/2 mice. These images correspond to Fig. 4 in the main manuscript. The endolymphatic sac epithelium consists mainly of ribosomal-rich cells that are interspersed by mitochondrial-rich cells. Mitochondrialrich cells express H + ATPase and the Cl 2 /HCO 3 2 exchanger pendrin in their apical membrane. Ribosomal-rich cells express Na + channels including ENaC. A current generated by the H + ATPase drives Na + reabsorption via Na + channels. The role of the Cl 2 /HCO 3 2 exchanger pendrin is to export HCO 3 2 that is generated by carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the reaction that leads to the generation of H + . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0014041.g010",
