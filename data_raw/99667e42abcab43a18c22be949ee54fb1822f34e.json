Multiple POIs for six records (due to multiple facilities). Queries were resolved. a) A new field labeled \"LINK\" was created in the dataset to allow for identification of \"linked\" (combined) facilities. b) For each of the records above, duplicate records were added as appropriate (i.e. one duplicate record for all except for the Victoria General et al records, for which two duplicate records were added to capture all three institutions). c) All non-duplicated records were assigned a unique LINK value; duplicated records were assigned the same LINK value d) New number of records, n=373 1. The data was opened and cleaned in Microsoft Excel: columns were re-named; extra spaces were removed and missing POI_IDs were added to the original data 2. The ICU data was imported into ArcGIS 10, as was the Enhanced Points of Interest (EPOI) Dataset, version 2010.3 3. The EPOI dataset was joined to the ICU dataset (target dataset) on the POI_ID field.",
