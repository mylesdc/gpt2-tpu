Having established a project to link primary care clinics based on two-way sharing of education rather than one-way aid, our United Kingdom colleagues often ask us: \"But what can we learn from Malawi?\" A recent fact-finding visit to Malawi helped us clarify some aspects of health care that may be of relevance to health care professionals in the developed world, including the United Kingdom. This commentary article is focused on encouraging debate and discussion as to how we might wish to re-think our relationship with colleagues in other health care environments and consider how we can work together on a theme of two-way shared learning rather than oneway aid.",

A voluntary guardian system might well be acceptable to United Kingdom patients and have the potential to favourably alter clinical outcome.

Again the experience of mentoring suggests that developing and formalizing support for patients may improve outcome. There is research evidence to suggest that clinical outcomes in cancer care can be enhanced if patients are \"mentored\": supported by volunteers or fellow sufferers [15] .

In Malawi, HIV testing is available in Health Ministry clinics and is voluntary, linked with counselling, hence VCT. \"VCT\" has entered the everyday vocabulary of Malawians because clinics display signs and an ongoing poster campaign helps to dispel stigma. Crucially, testing is available on demand with the result available quickly, sometimes on the same day. It is remarkable that a developed, resource-rich health care system such as the United Kingdom's NHS still persists with the archaic practice of keeping patients waiting at least a week to receive a result.

Acceptance of adversity, perhaps borne out of experience of hunger or lack of resources, allowed a health care system to cope with large numbers of patients every day. It was culturally unacceptable to make a fuss and so health care staff members were able to concentrate on seeing ill people in order of clinical need rather than according to who protested the loudest or booked in first. In a clinical system of high throughput, rapid diagnosis and lack of treatment options, complaining was seen as futile. We found the lack of privacy during consultations unsettling, particularly when two or more consultations took place in the same room or the same space outdoors. Our \"prudishness\" became a source of some amusement in an environment where attending to one's toileting needs was often a public matter.",

Malawian clinics fly the national flag and are proud to be associated with the Ministry of Health. It is doubtful whether United Kingdom clinics feel a similar need to be associated with the NHS.

The United Kingdom has recently learnt the painful lesson that increased monetary input does not directly correlate with improved health outcome. The major challenges facing the health of people in the United Kingdom are linked to lifestyle. Imaginative ways for families and communities working together to reduce smoking, increase exercise levels, improve nutrition and extend family support are more likely to yield dividends than increased GDP spent on hospitals.",
