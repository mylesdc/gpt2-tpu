            "text": "Background: Vision-based surveillance and monitoring is a potential alternative for early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks in urban areas complementing molecular diagnostics and hospital and doctor visit-based alert systems. Visible actions representing typical flu-like symptoms include sneeze and cough that are associated with changing patterns of hand to head distances, among others. The technical difficulties lie in the high complexity and large variation of those actions as well as numerous similar background actions such as scratching head, cell phone use, eating, drinking and so on. Results: In this paper, we make a first attempt at the challenging problem of recognizing flu-like symptoms from videos. Since there was no related dataset available, we created a new public health dataset for action recognition that includes two major flu-like symptom related actions (sneeze and cough) and a number of background actions. We also developed a suitable novel algorithm by introducing two types of Action Matching Kernels, where both types aim to integrate two aspects of local features, namely the space-time layout and the Bag-of-Words representations. In particular, we show that the Pyramid Match Kernel and Spatial Pyramid Matching are both special cases of our proposed kernels. Besides experimenting on standard testbed, the proposed algorithm is evaluated also on the new sneeze and cough set. Empirically, we observe that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts, while recognition on the new public health dataset is shown to be a non-trivial task even with simple single person unobstructed view. Conclusions: Our sneeze and cough video dataset and newly developed action recognition algorithm is the first of its kind and aims to kick-start the field of action recognition of flu-like symptoms from videos. It will be challenging but necessary in future developments to consider more complex real-life scenario of detecting these actions simultaneously from multiple persons in possibly crowded environments.",

Similarly, history has also shown us that previously unknown pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus could emerge and cause serious outbreaks [5] . Just in 2012 and 2013, there were 2 new outbreaks of different viruses with pandemic potential, MERS-CoV [6] and H7N9 [7] , triggering increased surveillance alerts.

Very recently a web-based surveillance tool has been developed by Google [17] , which is made possible through search engines by taking advantage of the social health-seeking behavior of patients. There are nonetheless concerns that there sometimes exists non-negligible bias in the detection results driven by disease publicity rather than the disease itself. The work presented in this paper, to our best knowledge, is the first to examine this problem with the help of vision-based surveillance and analysis.",

The elegant Hough transform [27] is originally devised to detect lines and circles. An important generalization is developed by Ballard [28] to detect objects of arbitrary shapes. Leibe et al. in their seminal work [13] consider a probabilistic variant of the Hough transform, where the BoW model is integrated into the voting space by means of conditional and posteriori probabilities. This is further followed by [14] where a dedicated max-margin learning method is developed. Throughout these methods, a crucial step is the construction of a voting space, where all local features are made to vote for the existence and if so, the location of the global object they belong to. An interesting observation is that this voting space is employed by [14] in an implicit manner. As clearly revealed from Equations (12) and (13) of [14] , the model or the parameter vector W is implicitly related to the voting space: W is interpreted as weights for the activations of codewords, where influence from the voting space is implicitly carried out via the activations. A latent variant has also been used for object detection [29] .",

The first type is by means of unary and binary extensions, while the second type is a modification of the successful Pyramid Match Kernel. As shown in Figure 1 , an action can be naturally depicted by a set of local features within a space-time action volume (the green cube illustrated in Figure 1 (a) bottom left), which we also refer to as action volume or simply volume when there is no confusion. In both cases, an input action corresponds to both a BoW model consisting of K codewords, as well as the features' locations in the space-time volume. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/300 Here local features ('+'s) of an action is contained in a space-time volume displayed as a green cube. Besides residing in this local coordinate, each feature also has a descriptor that is further mapped to the histogram of codewords representation using the bag-of-words model. This figure displays two examples of the proposed Type I Kernels. (a) presents a unary extension where the local volume is further partitioned into concentric layers. (b) demonstrates a binary extension scheme that considers the distance and codeword entries of feature pairs. Note other extension schemes are also possible.",

Naively this leads to a vector of length K \u00d7K \u00d7S, by accumulating the quantized distance of each feature pair with S possible outcomes. In practice it is further summarized into a more compact vector representation: For a fixed distance, (a) a K-dim vector is extracted from the diagonal elements. (b) a K-dim vector is obtained by summing over all the off-diagonal elements row-wise. For both cases the output vectors are normalized to sum to 1. As each case ends up giving a K \u00d7 S vector, a concatenation of both finally leads to a vector representation of length 2K \u00d7 S.",

One possible scheme is to consider a local coordinate with its origin fixed to the center of these features, and to explicitly examine all possible scales in a manner similarly to that of the Hough voting space. A simple scheme is instead considered in this paper, where the action volume is determined by aligning the bounding boxes detected using a human detector [34] .

Note written consent on publication and use of the video data was obtained from each volunteer and the study was cleared by the Bioinformatics Institute ethics committee represented by the executive director. This dataset contains 960 color video clips of imitated surveillance video settings, collected from 20 human subjects (8 females and 12 males) of 20 to 50 years old using a Canon VIXIA HF20 camcorder. A gallery of sample frames are displayed in Figure 3 . The data acquisition process is carried out in an indoor environment with semi-controlled lighting condition (sun lights through windows are present in some of the videos), and the camera is mounted on a tripod mimicking the relative height of a typical surveillance camera. Each clip contains one specific action performed by one subject in a particular view and pose. Video shots are normalized at 480 \u00d7 290 resolution, with stream rate of 5 frame per second, each lasts for around 15 seconds. In addition to the two flu-like behaviors, namely sneeze and cough, six common background action types are also included: drinking, phone calling, scratching head, stretching arms, wiping glasses and waving hands. Note we deliberately cover a spectrum of possible background action types that are relatively close to our actions of interest. In addition, each human subject performs each action six times under 2 different poses (standing and walking) and 3 different views (roughly frontal/left/right). We also perform horizontal flip on each video to produce an additional video set of reflective views, which results in a final set of 1920 videos.",

This leads to the utilization of precision and recall, which are computed by TP TP+FP and TP TP+FN , respectively.

We would like to emphasize that this dataset is significantly different and is more challenging comparing to the KTH dataset. First, the actions in this dataset, except for hand-waving, are usually of short time-span, in contrast to actions such as walk or boxing that usually consist of a good number of repetitive action cycles. Second, there exist large variations within the sneeze and cough actions over e.g. different genders, ages, and views. This is further complicated by the fact that the background actions commonly seen in public areas (such as phone calling, scratching head) are often very similar in appearance to flu-like symptoms. Meanwhile these 6 background actions by themselves are highly complex and exhibit large variations as well, as indicated in the sample frames of Figure 3 . By experimenting with 8-class recognition tasks, confusion matrices are obtained to facilitate our investigation into the inter-and cross-actions pattern of this new dataset. Figure 4 presents the confusion matrices obtained using baseline method (BoW+ \u03c7 2 ) and the proposed AMK type II kernel. When comparing the confusion matrices to the counterparts from KTH dataset, Figure 4 (a) vs. Figure 5 (a) and Figure 4 (b) vs. Figure 5(b) , it can be seen that the two baseline methods perform much worse on the Sneeze-Cough dataset than on the KTH dataset.

On average, we can see that this dataset is rather challenging. The best method merely reach an accuracy of around 44.4%, which can be partially explained by the large variations within cough/sneeze over various genders/ages/views, as well as their similar spacetime appearances to those of the background actions. For both cuboid and HOGHOF local features, we see significant improvement in accuracy by using specific AMKs compared to baseline methods. Take cuboid feature for example, we observe that using the AMK type I kernel with U b and S = 27 leads to an increase of accuracy by 12.5 points.
