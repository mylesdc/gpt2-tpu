            "text": "Viral diseases can spread through a variety of routes including aerosols. Yet, limited data are available on the efficacy of aerosolized chemicals to reduce viral loads in the air. Bacteriophages (phages) are often used as surrogates for hazardous viruses in aerosol studies because they are inexpensive, easy to handle, and safe for laboratory workers. Moreover, several of these bacterial viruses display physical characteristics similar to pathogenic human and animal viruses, like morphological size, type of nucleic acids, capsid morphology, and the presence of an envelope. In this study, the efficacy of four chemicals was evaluated on four airborne phages at two different relative humidity levels. Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2 (single-stranded RNA), \u03d56 (double-stranded RNA, enveloped), PR772 (double-stranded DNA), and \u03d5X174 (single-stranded DNA) were first aerosolized in a 55L rotative environmental chamber at 19\u02daC with 25% and 50% relative humidity. Then, hydrogen peroxide, Eugenol (phenylpropene used in commercial perfumes and flavorings), Mist \u00ae (automobile disinfectant containing Triethylene glycol), and Pledge \u00ae (multisurface disinfectant containing Isopropanol, n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides, and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) were nebulized with the phages using a separate nebulizer. Aerosols were maintained in suspension during 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours. Viral aerosols were sampled using an SKC BioSampler and samples were analyzed using qPCR and plaque assays. The resistance levels of the four phages varied depending on the relative humidity (RH) and germicidal products tested. Phage MS2 was the most stable airborne virus under the environmental conditions tested while phage PR772 was the least stable. Pledge \u00ae and Eugenol reduced the infectivity of all airborne phages tested. At 25% RH, Pledge \u00ae and Eugenol were more effective at reducing infectivity of RNA phages \u03d56 and MS2. At 50% RH, Pledge \u00ae was the most effective agent against phage MS2. These findings illustrate that various airborne viruses should be tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of germicidal treatments. This research also provides a set of parameters for testing germicidal products in large-scale settings to reduce the risk of virus transmission. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

            "text": "Introduction Viral diseases can spread through a variety of routes such as direct contact with an infected person or indirect contact with fomites, exposure to large droplets, and inhalation of aerosolized droplets nuclei. The latter is of interest as they can stay in the air for an extended period of time and travel long distances. Airborne transmission of viruses has been demonstrated for some diseases, including measles [1] and smallpox [2] . However, the airborne transmission of other well-known viruses like Influenza virus and Norovirus is still under investigation [3, 4] . Indoor environments are particularly advantageous for viral transmission, including hospital settings where transmission of nosocomial diseases is a major concern [4] [5] [6] . Other public or occupational spaces such as day care centers and wastewater treatment plants are also suspected to represent occupational hazards with respect to viral diseases [7, 8] .",

Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity (RH) have a crucial impact on the infectivity of airborne viruses and can naturally help reduce viral concentrations in the air [9] . For example, infectivity of airborne Influenza viruses is minimal between 40% and 50% RH when compared to 20% and 70% RH [10] . Conversely, the infectivity of coronavirus is higher at 50% RH as compared to 20% and 80% RH [11] . Rhinovirus infectivity diminishes rapidly at 30% and 50% RH in comparison to 80% RH [12] .

Some investigators have looked at the potential of chemical solutions such as gaseous chlorine dioxide to kill aerosolized bacteria and fungi in indoor settings [21, 22] . However, chlorine dioxide is highly reactive (it's difficult to transport, is an explosion hazard in gas form, can dissociate in to chlorine and oxygen during storage, etc.) and requires extreme safety precautions, which preclude its use for routine disinfection [23] . To our knowledge, there is very little (or no) information about the effectiveness of disinfectants against airborne viruses.",

            "text": "Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) are now widely used as models in aerosol studies [24] . They are relatively inexpensive to produce in large quantities and they do not require biosafety containment measures. Phages are highly diversified, and some of them possess structural similarities with human and animal viruses. Tailed phages with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), like phages T4 and T7, were used in several previous aerosol studies [24] . However, since eukaryotic viruses lack tails, non-tailed phage models have been utilized more often in recent years. RNA phage MS2 (Leviviridae family) is now one of the most used models in viral aerosol studies [24] . Phage MS2 is highly resistant to aerosolization and sampling, and represents a good surrogate of Newcastle disease virus [25] . Phages \u03d5X174 (Microviridae family), \u03d56 (Cystoviridae family), and PR772 (Tectiviridae family) have also been requently used [13, 15, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Previous studies have demonstrated that phages \u03d56 and PR772 displayed resistance to aerosolization and air sampling similar to Influenza virus [25] . Phage \u03d56 has been thought to be a good model for Influenza virus because it is an enveloped virus with a segmented RNA genome. The pattern of resistance to relative humidity exhibited by phage \u03d56 (resistant at low RH, very sensitive at middle RH, sensitive at high RH) is similar to what has been described for the Influenza virus [10, 15] .",

Therefore, the chamber had to be filled for every time point tested, and thus, each set of test conditions was considered a separate experiment. All tested conditions and time points were repeated twice. Phages were also aerosolized without germicidal agents as control experiments. Nebulizer content was analyzed using a plaque assay before and after aerosolization to measure phage infectivity over the duration of the experiments.",

Primers and probes used for qPCR reactions are listed in Table 3 and were provided by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Probes were labeled with FAM dye in 5' and with a combination of Zen and Iowa black FQ quencher in 3'. Quantitative PCR assays for phages \u03d56 and MS2 [27] and phages PR772 [25] and \u03d5X174 [26] have been developed in previous studies. Complete protocols for qPCR detection for these four phages can be found in the following reference [15] . Briefly, each 20 \u03bcl reaction contained the following: 10 \u03bcl of 2X iQ supermix for probe (Bio-Rad Laboratories), 2 \u03bcl of cDNA (MS2 and \u03d56) or 5 \u03bcl of sample (PR772 and \u03d5X174), and 1 \u03bcM of forward and reverse primers. The reaction mix also contained the following probe concentrations: 150 nM, 300 nM, 200 nM and 200 nM for MS2, \u03d56, \u03d5X174, and PR772, respectively. Reactions were performed using a BioRad CFX 96 or BioRad CFX384.

In previous experiments, it has been demonstrated that viruses genomes are stable under air sampling conditions used in this study [15, 25, 33] , therefor, qPCR was used to measure total phage genomes in all samples. The ratio of infectious phages in air samples was calculated by dividing the number of infectious phages as determined by plaque assays by the number of phage genomes estimated by qPCR. Because infectious ratio is affected by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR efficiency [27] as well as by aggregates in plaque assays, the value may be below or above 1. These assays bias are phage-specific and therefore, infectious ratios should not be used to compare phages. However, infectious ratios can be used to compare the effect of environmental conditions (relative humidity and exposure time) on each phage since the limitations are likely the same for all samples of the same phage. The effect of germicidal agents was expressed as a relative ratio of the infectious phages ratio aerosolized with chemicals divided by infectious phages ratio aerosolized without chemicals as displayed in Eq 3.",

The univariate normality assumption was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk tests on the error distribution from the statistical model after a Cholesky factorization. The Brown and Forsythe's variation of Levene's test was used to verify the homogeneity of variances. When appropriate, some variables were log-transformed to fulfill the model assumptions. Reported p-values were based on these transformations. When these assumptions were not fulfilled, an alternative procedure called rank transformation was used. In a rank transformation the observations are replaced by their rank and an ordinary F-test from ANOVA is applied. This analysis does not depend on the assumptions required by the Brown and Forsythe's variation of Levene's test. This technique resulted into good statistical properties when compared to standard test. When results from raw or log-transformed data were compared with ranks and yielded similar results, data from the standard analyses were retained. When results differed, the rank transformation data was preferred. Posteriori comparisons were performed using Tukey's comparison test. Results were considered significant when p-values 0.05.

As indicated in the Materials and Methods section, the data are presented as relative infectivity ratios, which allows for the analysis of the germicidal product effect alone without interference of the RH. The reference values obtained without germicidal product (relative infectivity ratio = 1) are represented by the dotted lines in Figs 2-4. All germicidal products had a significant effect on phage MS2 relative infectivity ratios at 25% RH (p<0.003) and 50% RH (p<0.005) (Fig 2) .

Although a reduction of MS2 infectious particles was noticed between 1 and 2 hours of exposure with all germicidal products at 25% RH, the effect of exposure time was not significant under these conditions (p = 0.06).

Although 80% RH exposure was not tested in here, we did not observe significant differences between infectivity at 25% and 50% RH.",

However, the effect was only statistically significant for the two RNA phages, MS2 and \u03d56 (Figs 2 and 3) . Surprisingly, the relative infectious ratios of phage \u03d56 were above one when aerosolized with MiST 1 (containing Triethylene glycol), which may suggest a protective effect on phage infectivity (Fig 3) . Experiments using phage \u03d5X174, showed that the relative infectious ratios were below one with Pledge 1 , Eugenol, and H 2 O 2 at 25% RH and with Pledge 1 and Eugenol at 50% RH (Fig 4) . These data indicate that the chemicals reduced the infectivity of airborne phage \u03d5X174 compared to the reference values without germicidal product. The time spent airborne also has a strong effect on phage \u03d5X174 infectivity (Fig 1) . For 1 hour and 2 hours of exposure at 50% RH, the impact of germicidal agents on the reduction of phage \u03d5X174 relative infectious ratios was less pronounced due to the effect of increased exposure time (Fig 4) . The effects of germicidal agents on the four phages are summarized in Table 4 . Others have also observed a virus-dependent response to sanitizing conditions. Coronavirus was shown to be 7-10 times more vulnerable to UV than Adenovirus and phage MS2 [18] . Phages T7 and MS2 were more resistant to ozone than \u03d56 and \u03d5X174 [13] , while T7 was more resistant to UV than MS2, \u03d56, and \u03d5X174 [19] .",

For example, ethanol-and isopropanol-based solutions (>30%) are slowly aerosolized compared to water-based solutions (more than 7 times longer to aerosolize the same volume). The Aeroneb Lab is widely used in drug delivery assays because it is nondestructive, can be used between 5 to 30 liters of air per minutes without influencing the liquid volume nebulized, and can aerosolise >0.2 ml of water-based solution per minute [38] . Since the composition of each of the germicidal agents used was different, the volume aerosolized and the concentration reached in the chamber for each agent was also different ( Table 2 ). In our experimental setup it was necessary to fit the germicidal nebulization time within the phage's nebulization times. The nebulization time was set to 10 min in order to reach the same phage concentration in the chamber for all the assays. Because the infectivity of phages PR772 and \u03d5X174 is strongly affected by their time spent airborne, it was essential to standardize Previous studies have demonstrated that 10-20 seconds of exposure to UV light or ozone reduces 90% of the remaining infectious viruses in an aerosol chamber [13, 15] . Since the doses tested are harmful to humans, these methods could be used in ventilation ducts or ceilings but not in occupied spaces. In the current study, two hours of exposure to Pledge 1 or Eugenol were necessary for a 1-log reduction of infectious phage MS2. For phages \u03d56 and \u03d5X174, this 1-log reduction was achieved after only 10 minutes (time 0) of exposure to Pledge 1 and Eugenol.",
