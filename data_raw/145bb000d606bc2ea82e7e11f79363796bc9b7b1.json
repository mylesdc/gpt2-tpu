However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture-including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domainlike regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif-are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3-80% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal-fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.",

The prototypic member, CEA (or CEACAM5), was initially discovered as a membrane-anchored tumor antigen [1] . CEACAM subfamily proteins have since been shown to play important roles in the regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, the differentiation of mammary glands, insulin signaling turnover, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . By contrast, PSGs have been characterized as highly glycosylated major proteins from human syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy. High levels of human PSGs have been detected in maternal serum as early as 3 days postfertilization, coinciding with the attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall, and were believed to be critical for protecting the semiallotypic fetus from the maternal immune system during pregnancy in, at least, primates [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] .",

            "text": "Whereas the CEACAM/PSG genes were previously considered eutherian-specific, recent studies have shown that homologs with 30-50% protein sequence similarity to human CEACAMs are present in the marsupial opossum and monotreme platypus [20, 21] . Interestingly, the inventory of CEACAM/PSG genes in mammals appeared to vary greatly even among closely related species. For example, whereas mice contain 27 CEACAM/PSG homologs, rats have only 16 counterparts [20, 21] . In addition, earlier studies of nucleotide substitution and the dN/dS ratio in primates and rodents showed that select CEACAM/PSG genes underwent positive or purifying selection [22, 23] . These earlier observations suggested that the duplication/retention of CEA-CAM/PSG genes could be susceptible to environmental selection, and the process could be similar to the birth, fixation, and loss of adaptive genes such as olfactory receptors and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in select vertebrates [24, 25, 26] . Because the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid selection across closely related species provides only a rough estimate of genetic variation within a narrow time frame, how unique the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes in vertebrates remains to be investigated. In addition, the difficulty in analyzing CEACAM/PSG gene evolution was further aggravated by the large variation in gene repertoire among species, which violates various assumptions of statistical methods commonly used in the analysis of gene selection. Accordingly, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis that encompasses a wide time spectrum is needed to better understand the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes. Here, based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes and the analysis of genetic variations in humans, we show that CEACAM/PSG genes represent an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and were frequently subject to selection by geneenvironmental interactions. Importantly, we also found that human CEACAM/PSG locus is enriched with genetic variations, and the PSG gene inventory could range from 12 to 30 copies among individuals, indicating an ongoing selection of these genes in major, geographically separated human populations. Because PSGs and CEACAMs are important for normal pregnancy and immune responses, our study thus provides a framework for further exploration of adaptive genotype-phenotype relationships involving these fast-evolving genes in reproduction, pregnancy complications, and other patho-physiologies in humans.",

Initially, human and mouse CEACAM sequences were compared against the genomes and proteomes of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), bushbaby (Otolemur garnettii), mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), dog (Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagri gallopavo), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis), stickleback (Gasteroteus aculeatus), little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), and tunicates (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi). Unique protein sequences with E,0.0001 were analyzed with additional blast searches against the human nonredundant protein database to detect the best reciprocal hits. In this step, we excluded homologs for other proteins with IgV-like and IgC-like motifs that did not share a common root with mammalian CEACAMs. Due to sequence divergence, the relationship between newly identified homologs and human CEACAMs cannot be determined unambiguously. Based on this observation and earlier studies, we reasoned that CEACAM family genes likely underwent extensive neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization after gene duplication, and that heterotachy incurred by functional divergence led to the difficulty in phylogeny analysis [29] . Therefore, we sought to determine the phylogenetic relationship of novel CEACAM family genes with syntenic mapping.",

We inferred that a pair of duplicates in teleosts would be whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived co-orthologs if they were located on human-T. nigroviridis or human-D. rerio syntenic chromosomal regions. By contrast, CEACAM found on neighboring loci on the same chromosome were determined to have been derived from tandem duplications. Therefore, the presence of an ancestor for a select group of CEACAMs in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a select lineage was deduced from analyses combining BLAST results and syntenic mapping. However, we cannot exclude the possibility, albeit a low probability, that some teleost homologs found on duplicated syntenic chromosomal regions were not WGD-derived coorthologs.",

Due to the high divergence of CEACAM protein sequences, it is impossible to obtain a reliable alignment that includes all CEACAM homologs. We resorted to select representative genes from each lineage so that outlier sequences were not included in the multiple sequence alignment. We constructed representative sets of genes from three targeted clades: primate only, mammal only, and fish only. The amino-acid sequences were aligned using MUSLE v3.8 with default settings [33] . The pairwise genetic distances between amino-acid sequences was estimated using the JTT matrix-based method [34] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. The phylogenetic trees were first constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [35] implemented in MEGA v5.05 [36] .

Syntenic mapping indicated that zebrafish and T. nigroviridis CEACAM genes are located on whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived chromosome fragments, and that zebrafish CEACAMs on chromosome 16 are located on three separate loci (I, II, and III). The WGD-derived syntenic chromosomal regions in teleosts are indicated by a yellow background. The chromosomal number and the genomic contig number are indicated at the top of the schematic representation of each genomic fragment. CEACAM family genes are indicated by red diamond-shaped symbols. Marker genes are identified by colored diamond-shaped symbols. The relative position of genes on chromosomes and contigs is shown next to the gene symbols. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061701.g001 relationship between these homologs and those of humans. Interestingly, although phylogenetic trees built with the Neighbor-Joining method showed little confidence on the relationship of most opossum and platypus homologs with those of eutherian homologs (Fig. 2b) , phylogenetic trees built with the Maximum Likelihood method suggested that mammalian CEACAMs can be separated into two major branches: CEACAM16/18/20 and those clustered with the better characterized human CEACAM1like members ( Fig. 3b; Fig. S1 in File S1). In addition, the majority of metatherian homologs clustered in a sub-branch appeared to separate from those of human CEACAM1-like members.",

Likewise, the homolog on scaffold 35 (TruCEACAMIV) was 20 Kbp from an XRCC1 ortholog (Fig. 1c) . On the other hand, the closely related pufferfish T. nigroviridis contained only three homologs (TniCEACAM Ia, Ib, and II). TniCEACAM Ia and II were found near marker genes ZNF574 and ATP1A3, and PAFAH1B3, LIPE, TMEM145, and TOMM40a, respectively. By contrast, TniCEACAM Ib was located with a second TOMM40 ortholog (TOMM40b) and an ETHE1 ortholog. Based on the understanding that a WGD occurred before the divergence of teleosts and osteoglossomorphs more than 230-350 million years ago [30, 42, 43] , TniCEACAM Ia and Ib as well as the pair of TOMM40 (a and b) genes likely represent WGD-derived co-orthologs.",

This observation led us to further hypothesize that the selection shaping CEACAM/PSG gene repertoire in apes could be ongoing, and human CEACAM/ PSG genes, as a group, could continue to diverge at a pace greater than that of other genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the extent of genetic variations (i.e., CNVs and SNPs) in human CEACAM/PSG genes, and whether the occurrence of CNVs and SNPs differs among human populations. In these analyses, richness and diversity of structural and nucleotide variations were used as proxies to determine the tendency for selection.",

First, we compared the density of synonymous and nonsynonymous generegion SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes to those of other genes on chromosome 19. Although the density of synonymous SNPs within CEACAM/PSG genes was similar to the average of other genes, the density of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes was significantly higher than that of the rest of genes on chromosome 19 (Table 1 , p,0.01). Consistently, whereas 40% of CEACAM/ PSG genes contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP, only 8.3% of the 1,363 other genes on chromosome 19 contained nonsynonymous SNPs (Table 2 ).

In support of our hypothesis, we found that only 3.2% (N = 43) and 2.6% (N = 34) of a total of 1327 non-CEACAM/PSG genes contained at least one coding SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket of all SNPs, respectively. On the other hand, seven and three out of 25 CEACAM/PSG genes (28% and 12%) had at least one coding SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively. In addition, we found that eight out of these 25 genes contained gene region SNPs with F ST scores in the top 5% bracket (Table S6 in File S1). In addition to CEACAM/PSG genes, chromosome 19 encodes several gene families that exhibit functional and evolutional characteristics similar to CEACAM/PSGs. These progressive gene families includes sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin, leukocyte immunoglobulinlike receptor, and olfactory receptor gene families [29, 31, 42, 43, 54, 55] . They encode secreted ligands or cell surface receptors, and the family size expanded multiple times during the evolution of primates. Interestingly, 25% and 19.4% of genes in these three families contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively (Table 3) . Therefore, the ratio of genes containing coding SNP(s) with a high F ST score in CEACAM/PSG and these three progressive gene families is categorically higher than other genes (conserved genes) on chromosome 19 (Fig. 6, Table 3 ).

The radical divergence of gene inventory occurred even among species under the same family, perhaps reflecting the extensive birth-and-death of CEACAM/PSG genes in response to environmental selection. Interestingly, CEACAM/PSG genes appeared to evolve in a similar manner in humans. The CECAM/PSG locus contained a higher density of nonsynonymous SNPs compared to other genes on the same chromosome. In addition, these genetic variations exhibited high population differentiation in geographically separated human populations. Similar to studies of SNPs, we found that structural variations are common at the PSG locus, and these copy number polymorphisms exhibit population differentiation. Together with earlier studies on the dN/dS ratio in primate and rodent species [22, 23] , these results indicated that CEACAM/PSG genes had a more dynamic evolutionary history than previously thought.",

However, due to the extensive divergence in CEACAM/PSG sequences, it has been difficult to extrapolate animal studies to humans and vice versa, thereby limiting our understanding of the molecular and biochemical nature of CEACAM/PSG signaling. Here, syntenic mapping has clarified the relationship of various CEACAM-like genes identified in noneutherian mammals and basal taxonomy. In addition, our analysis implied that the characteristic CEACAM-signaling pathway that involves the recruitment of downstream molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP1 phosphatase, and RAC-GTPase by ITAM or ITIM motifs could have evolved in the MRCA of teleosts and tetrapods, but not in urocordates, cephalochordates or sea lamprey [7, 61] . Furthermore, our analysis indicated that CEACAM/PSG gene family represents an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Earlier analyses of adaptive immunity have shown that jawed and jawless vertebrates developed antigen receptors independently, and the hallmark of adaptive immunity of vertebrates, including major histocompatibility complex molecules and T/B-cell receptors originated in jawed vertebrates [42, 54] . Thus, the immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-containing CEACAM family genes have evolved in parallel with BCRs, TCRs, and FcRc receptors in jawed vertebrates.",

            "text": "Changes in selection pressures over time could leave diverse footprints of selection in genes. In general, the methods for detecting the action of selection vary with timescales. On the longest timescales, selection is evidenced by differences in gene inventory and gene functions. At shorter timescales, selection is indicated by an excess of nonsynonymous changes as compared to synonymous substitutions. At time scales ,80 thousand years, positively selected SNPs in humans could be detected by an excess of derived alleles in LD because there is no sufficient time for the genetic diversity to be restored by mutation and drift [56, 62] . However, none of these studies alone could provide a comprehensive view of how divergent the evolution of a gene family was. This is particularly true for gene families that contain redundant members. In addition, varied arrangements of functional domains among paralogs, such as those found in CEACAM/PSG genes, could add to the challenge of analysis of gene evolution [56, 62] . In the present study, we broadened the study of CEACAM/PSG gene evolution in two directions: the identification of CEACAM homologs in basal taxonomy (long timescale) and the investigation of genetic diversity in humans during a short timescale (i.e., after the Out-of-Africa human migration). On the first front, we found that CEACAM genes evolved in a radical manner in various lineages. In an extreme instance, these genes were completely lost (i.e., avian species). On the second front, we took two complementary approaches-local variations in density of coding SNPs/ CNVs and population-based assessment of genetic variations-to assess the extent of divergence. In these analyses, genes on chromosome 19, rather than the genome-wide samples, were selected to account for local substitution rate variation. In these analyses, we found CEACAM/PSG genes contain high density of nonsynonymous SNPs and CNVs, and many of these genetic variations exhibit high population differentiation, indicating extensive gene-environmental interactions at the CEACAM/ PSG locus. In addition, these data suggested that the selection force shaping the expanded CEACAM/PSG gene inventory in Old World primates is ongoing in humans. Whereas the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated, the evolutionary course of these genes could be a result of combinations of factors. First, the high frequency of genetic variations at the CEACAM/ PSG locus could be a result of relaxed constraint. Recent studies have revealed that an estimated 5-10% of the vertebrate gene repertoire consist of _progressive (vs. conserved) gene families which mainly function in immunity, reproduction, and chemosensory [25, 63, 64, 65] , and that ligands and cell surface receptors could be preferentially retained after gene duplications, perhaps due to low constraints imposed by fewer interacting protein partners compared to intracellular polypeptides that form complexes with many partners in two-way communication [66, 67] . Because CEACAMs and PSGs mainly function as cell surface receptor or secreted ligand, their evolution could be similar to that of a variety of progressive genes, including olfactory receptors, male gamete-associated reproductive genes, KIRs, and other immune-associated gene families, which experienced frequent birth-and-death of duplicated genes in response to environmental pressures.",

            "text": "It is well accepted that frequent gene gain and gene loss in progressive genes could be the result of unequal crossover of genes with repeated domains, which can promote rearrangements through their own repeatability [68, 69] . Similarly, recent studies have shown that CNV mutation rates in duplication-rich regions could be significantly higher than SNPs due to their propensity to undergo nonallelic homologous recombination, thereby making CNV to be recurrent at specific loci [70] . Physiologically, the redundancy of CEACAM/PSG genes could be selected for the provision of a robustness against null phenotypes in individuals [71, 72] . In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that transgenic mice deficient for Ceacam1, 9, or 10 exhibit minimal or no aberrant phenotypes [3, 73, 74] . In addition, the enhanced redundancy could, theoretically, further reduce the constraint and add new opportunities for genetic drift or selection to operate on new alleles, thereby allowing the accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs in duplicated PSG genes. However, it is important to note that the presence of repeated sequences alone could not account for the selection of high genetic variations at the CEACAM/PSG locus. Recent studies of CNV hotspots in humans have identified several duplication-rich regions on chromosome 19, which contain clusters of zinc finger proteins (ZNFs, with a total of 204 members on chromosome 19) [75] . However, these ZNF cluster loci did not exhibit appreciable increases of genetic variations as compared to other genes on chromosome 19. For example, the ratio of ZNF family genes that have a high F ST nonsynonymous SNP (5.4%) is similar to that of other genes on the same chromosome (3.2%).",

Likewise, CNVs have been associated with a number of human phenotypes and diseases [80, 81] .

Given that CEACAM/PSGs could act through homophilic and heterophilic interactions [7, 9] , the pressure to select new variants could be self-enforced if the carrier of a new immuno-modulation CEACAM/PSG variant favors fetus with the new variant as a result of immunocompatibility. By the same token, this mechanism could also contribute to the high population differentiation of select CEACAM/PSG variants. Therefore, our finding could represent an important vehicle for exploring novel genotype-phenotype relationships in PSG-mediated fetal-maternal interactions. In addition, our study raised the possibility that genetic variations at the PSG locus could be involved in the manifestation of reduced fertility and various pregnancy complications in select individuals. In support of our speculation, a recent report indicated that there could be a nominal relationship between PSG11 gene copy variation and the occurrence of preeclampsia [88] .",
