CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-\u03baB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.",

Lung injury is predominant and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. In airways, CFTR dysfunction leads to alterations in mucociliary clearance and impairment of innate immune host defenses. This results in chronic bacterial infection and inflammation, leading to degradation of the lung epithelium and progressive lung damage in CF patients (4) . Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the leading cause of chronic pulmonary infection in the airways of adults with CF (5) . Pa colonization induces a strong inflammatory response in CF patients, particularly neutrophil accumulation and hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8 (6, 7) .",

Lung epithelial cells are sufficient to generate an innate protective immune response in mice infected with Pa (9). In CF, establishment of chronic pulmonary infection with Pa is linked to alterations in epithelial cell responses, which do not allow establishment of an adequate defense system (4) . Previously, we showed that this response was indeed different by comparative analysis of the transcriptomic signatures of primary CF and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells during Pa infection (10) . We identified several up-and downregulated mRNAs in CF cells compared with those in non-CF cells, suggesting that these genes may be involved in the exacerbated inflammatory response to Pa found in CF patients. Among these dysregulated mRNAs, ChaC glutathione-specific \u03b3-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) showed dramatically differential expression between non-CF and CF cells both at baseline and after Pa infection.",

            "text": "CHAC1 was identified in mammalian cells for the first time in 2009 as a new component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (11) . This UPR pathway is induced in response to ER stress due to the presence of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The UPR consists of three pathways initiated by inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-\u03b1 kinase 3 (PERK), and activation transcription factor (ATF) 6 (12). These three pathways alleviate ER stress by decreasing protein synthesis, facilitating protein folding, and increasing protein degradation. CHAC1 is induced by the PERK pathway downstream of ATF4 and the pro-apoptotic factor DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3 also called CHOP) and has been described as necessary and sufficient to induce markers of apoptosis, particularly the cleavage of the apoptotic factor poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) (11) . Moreover, CHAC1 can degrade glutathione in the cytosol of mammalian cells through its \u03b3-glutamylcyclotransferase activity (13) . Various studies have shown a link between ER stress and inflammation (12, 14, 15) . In the context of CF, atypical activation of the UPR pathway has been observed; the resulting ER stress can potentiate the inflammatory response (12) . Moreover, the UPR is implicated in the regulation of cytokine production for bacterial infections (16) . The role of CHAC1 in this interplay between ER stress and inflammation in the context of Pa infection has never been investigated.",

We studied the effects of two very well-known virulence factors, LPS and flagellin from Pa, on hAECBs from CF and non-CF patients and on NCI-H292 cells, which expressed CHAC1 mRNA at sufficient levels for further knockdown experiments in comparison to BEAS-2B cells (Supplementary Figure 2A) . Notably, 6 h of stimulation with LPS and flagellin induced CHAC1 expression in hAECBs from non-CF patients, similar to whole bacteria at a MOI of 0.25 for 6 h. This induction by LPS and flagellin and by living bacteria was not found in hAECBs from CF patients (Figure 1C) . We observed similar effects of LPS and flagellin on CHAC1 expression in NCI-H292 cells (Figure 2A) . To validate the role of flagellin in CHAC1 expression, we used a mutant of the Pa PAK strain, FliC, in which flagellin was deleted. We observed a significantly lower increase in CHAC1 mRNA expression when NCI-H292 cells were stimulated with the FliC strain than with the WT PAK strain (Figure 2B) . We also tested a double mutant of the Pa PAK strain with both type II and III secretion systems deleted ( pscF xcpQ). This mutant induced CHAC1 mRNA expression, similar to the WT PAK strain (Figure 2B) . The difference in CHAC1 expression observed with the FliC strain was not due to different MOI since equal numbers of Pa colonies were found on LB agar (Supplementary Figure 3A) . Subsequently, in order to determine whether the observed CHAC1 upregulation was restricted to the laboratory PAK strain, we used Pa strains freshly isolated from different patients with CF. We observed that clinical isolates of Pa were also able to induce CHAC1 mRNA expression in NCI-H292 cells (Figure 2C ) with an effect similar to PAK. This induction is highly variable between the clinical strains used and may reflect difference of virulence of each strain, since the number of the bacteria used for stimulation is similar (Supplementary Figure 3B) . CHAC1 induction by PAK strain is also highly variable (Figure 2C) , and is likely due to the variability in the inoculum used (Supplementary Figure 3B) . We also observed that the induction of CHAC1 mRNA expression by PAK was higher in NCI-H292 cells than in hAECBs (Figures 2B,C vs. Figure 1C ). Finally, we tested two other bacterial species known to colonize the airways of patients with CF, i.e., S. aureus and S. maltophilia. Using a similar MOI, we observed reduced CHAC1 mRNA induction in NCI-H292 cells infected with S. aureus and S. maltophilia compared with that in the cells infected with Pa. Concomitantly, induction of IL-8 mRNA expression was reduced ( Figure 2D ). The differences in CHAC1 and IL-8 mRNA expression observed with S. aureus and S. maltophilia were not caused by different MOI because equal numbers of colonies were found on LB agar (Supplementary Figure 3C) .",

In contrast, LPS from E. coli has previously been shown to activate both PERK and ATF4 in A549 cells (33) . Notably, ATF4 has been shown to be directly recruited by TLR4 independent of ER stress in human monocytes (34) . Consistent with our results, another ER stress-associated molecule, GADD34, was recently shown to be upregulated by several virulence factors from Pa, including pyocyanin and AprA, independent of PERK but dependent on ATF4 (35) . Taken together, these results were consistent with emerging evidence showing that induction of the UPR pathway by microorganisms did not reflect ER stress but was an integral part of the immune response and TLR pathways (36) .",

However, its contribution to the regulation of cytokine production in bacterial infection is not well understood (16) . Here, we observed that inhibition of CHAC1 mRNA expression by siRNA promoted IL-8 and CCL2 expression and PGE2 secretion, suggesting that CHAC1 prevents excessive inflammatory responses dependent on the NF-\u03baB p65 pathway. These results were consistent with a recent study reporting that bronchial epithelial cells undergoing ER stress showed reduced IL-8 and CXCL1 production in the presence of inflammatory stimuli (38) . Indeed, pretreatment of bronchial epithelial cells with TM [shown here and by others (11) to be able to increase CHAC1 expression] can prevent IL-8 and CXCL1 production. In contrast, inhibition of CHAC1 mRNA expression by siRNA inhibits IL-6 production, suggesting that CHAC1 may promote IL-6 expression. Our results were consistent with a previous study showing that TM promotes IL-6 secretion in bronchial IB3-1 (CF deficient) and C38 cells stimulated with flagellin (12) . Previous works have demonstrated that IL-6 production in A375 skin cells is dependent on CHOP (39) . However, CHOP is expected to be upstream in the CHAC1 pathway and does not explain our results; future studies are needed to determine how the IL-6 pathway is affected specifically in lung epithelial cells.",

However, these cells are not completely resistant to apoptosis since staurosporine was able to induce caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Thus, although CHAC1 was induced by Pa, it was not sufficient to induce cell apoptosis. It is conceivable that the level of induction of CHAC1 may be too low to promote apoptosis. In contrast, high induction of CHAC1 using an overexpression plasmid led to induction of PARP cleavage, indicative of cell apoptosis. Apoptosis dysfunction is still highly controversial in CF (44) , and our results are partly consistent with some previous studies. Indeed, even if Pa has been previously shown to induce apoptosis in lung epithelial cells, variable susceptibility between lung epithelial cells has been observed. Moreover, the PAO1 strain of Pa has been shown to induce apoptosis in human tracheal 9HTEo cells but not in primary nasal epithelial cells from polyps or in 16HBE14o bronchial cells, which are both resistant (45) . In contrast, other bronchial cell lines are permissive to apoptosis induced by Pa, such as IB3-1 (F508del/W1282X), C38, S9 (both IB3-1 corrected cells), CFT1-LCFSN, and CFT1-LC3 (F508del) cells. More recently, using Calu-3 polarized lung epithelial cells, researchers showed that PAO1 was able to induce apoptosis markers, such as active caspase-3, within 6-8 h. Additionally, the effects of the CFTR genotype on apoptosis of lung epithelial cells at baseline (44) or after Pa infection are still debated and may be dependent on which specific marker of apoptosis is being evaluated (45, 46) .",

Moreover, CHAC1 was induced preferentially in normal hAECBs in comparison to CF hAECBs in response to Pa and its virulence factors, LPS and flagellin. Thus, these results suggest that low CHAC1 expression may contribute to the excessive inflammation observed in CF bronchial epithelial cells after Pa infection and thus may be associated with the exacerbation of inflammation characterizing the lungs from patients with CF. Inflammation is complex and thought to have a critical impact during the course of CF lung disease (47) . A better understanding of the link between infection and inflammation is thus required for the development of new therapeutics.",

We observed that ATF4, PCK2, and HERPUD1 were significantly downregulated in hAECBs from CF patients vs. in hAECBs from non-CF patients(Supplementary Figures 1A-Cand Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, ATF3 and TNFRSF6B were upregulated (Supplementary Figures 1D,E and Supplementary Table 1) in hAECBs from CF patients during the course of infection by Pa.
