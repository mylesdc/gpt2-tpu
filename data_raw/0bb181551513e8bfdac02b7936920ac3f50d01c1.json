Here, we demonstrate that influenza evolution within infected humans recapitulates many evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale. We deep-sequence longitudinal samples from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections. We find parallel evolution across three scales: within individual patients, in different patients in our study, and in the global influenza population. In hemagglutinin, a small set of mutations arises independently in multiple patients. These same mutations emerge repeatedly within single patients and compete with one another, providing a vivid clinical example of clonal interference. Many of these recurrent within-host mutations also reach a high global frequency in the decade following the patient infections. Our results demonstrate surprising concordance in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales.",

Within hosts, a mutation's impact on viral replication and immunogenicity affect whether it increases in frequency. At larger scales of space and time, transmission bottlenecks (Varble et al., 2014; Poon et al., 2016) and host heterogeneity also shape viral genetic diversity. The selective pressures at these various scales reflect complex molecular, immunological, and epidemiological constraints (Grenfell et al., 2004; Pybus and Rambaut, 2009; Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014; Neher et al., 2016) , which have formed the basis of recent efforts to forecast influenza evolution (Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014; Neher et al., 2016 , Neher et al., 2014 L\u00e4ssig et al., 2017) .",

We identified nine sites in the influenza genome where parallel mutations arose in two or more patients in our study: five in HA, three in NA, and one in the nonstructural (NS) segment ( Figure 2C , Figure 2-figure supplement 7; HA: p<0.001; NA: p<0.01; permutation test).

We suspected that the complex dynamics of these within-host mutations might arise from competition among mutant lineages. The influenza genome consists of eight linear segments that freely reassort with one another but do not recombine (Boni et al., 2008) , meaning that each segment evolves clonally. In the absence of homologous recombination, lineages carrying beneficial mutations rise and fall in frequency as they compete with one another, making it harder for any one variant to fix. This phenomenon, known as clonal interference, has been characterized extensively in experimental evolution (Hegreness et al., 2006; Kao and Sherlock, 2008; Lang et al., 2013; Neher, 2013) and affects influenza's global evolution (Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012) .",

Dashed lines indicate that multiple mutations could have produced a particular haplotype. Gray lines indicate that a mutation did not arise at a detectable frequency on a particular haplotype background. (C) Frequencies of haplotypes at HA sites 138, 193, 223, and 225 in patient W. [Weis et al., 1990] ). (B) Overlap of within-host (orange) and global (green) variable sites in HA, NA, and all other influenza genes. Sites at which mutations arise in more than one patient are indicated in solid orange. We defined global variable sites as those at which a variant reached a frequency of at least 10% in a given year after 2000 in the GISAID database of global influenza sequences (Bogner et al., 2006) . Numbers of within-host and global mutations are given in observed number of within-host and global variants were drawn at random from each gene (Figure 4-figure supplements 1-2) . Not all sites are expected to tolerate mutation, so we also performed simulations where we only considered sites for which there was variation in human H3N2 influenza globally between 2000 and 2015: for instance, in HA about 25% of codon sites show no variation within the GISAID database. We found significant parallelism in HA (p<0.01), but not in NA or in the rest of the genome (p>0.05) when we consider all sites of global variation. This parallelism in HA evolution remains statistically significant at a 0.05 threshold until we assume that less than 50% of HA codon sites tolerate variation. The parallelism is especially striking at the sites of HA mutations found in multiple patients in our study. In particular, four of the five sites of recurrent within-host mutation in HA are also sites of global influenza variation (Figure 4 , Figure 4 -source data 1). The V223I and N225D mutations arise in multiple patients, and then fix globally in the decade after the patient infections ( Figure 4D ). Mutations also reach high global frequencies at sites 138 and 193, although the F193 and S193 variants that spread globally differ from the Y193 variant that arises within our patients. However, the concordance is incomplete. Mutation L427F reaches a frequency of >75% in three patients but is rare or nonexistent in influenza globally ( Figure 4D) , suggesting that this mutation may have withinhost benefits that are not reflected in global evolution. But overall across hemagglutinin, within-host variants tend to arise at sites that vary on the global scale.",

Finally, given sufficiently large population sizes, high mutation rates, and time, these beneficial mutations will emerge and be selected to detectable frequencies.

For instance, one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants, and mostly at low frequencies (Dinis et al., 2016) . But our study suggests that influenza may experience many of the same selective pressures within acute infections as it does globally, even if the short durations of these infections make it difficult for selected mutations to reach frequencies that are detectable with current methods. We suggest that within-host viral diversity may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution, shaped by some of the same immunological and evolutionary constraints. As high-throughput sequencing continues to improve, detailed characterization of within-host variation will be increasingly valuable for understanding how molecular, immunological, and epidemiological forces interact to shape viral evolution.",

We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation among all four patients in this simulated data set, and we compared this distribution to the number of unique sites observed in our sequencing data: fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism (Figure 2-figure supplement 7A ). This null model is overly simplistic, since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint. To estimate this constraint, we limited the number of sites considered mutable to the sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015 (see Analysis of Global Variation) ( Figure 2-figure supplement 7B ). The p-values given in the main text are calculated under this more conservative null model. We also performed permutation tests for a range of possible proportions of mutable sites and calculated the fraction of simulations that matched or exceeded the amount of parallelism observed in our data ( Figure 2-figure supplement 7C) .",
