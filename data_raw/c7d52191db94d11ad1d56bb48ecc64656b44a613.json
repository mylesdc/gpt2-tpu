The publication by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of estimates for the burden of very many diseases in very many countries drew sharp responses, in two waves. The first wave focused largely on technical issues. Academics and health officials from several countries were confronted with estimates they found hard to reconcile with the facts as they saw them; this led to many questions about data sources [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Experts working globally on specific disease areas questioned methods, complaining that they could not see the workings inside the 'black box' of IHME models [3, 11] . Rumbling under both of these areas of concern was a larger discomfort, which built into a second wave of responses, questioning power relationships in global health.",

Several contributors to this debate recognised that data and concepts in global health are institutionally and politically constructed: a health issue rises up the international agenda because people deemed to be experts have used accepted methods to demonstrate its importance, and have communicated that in forums which entrench that importance (and which influence funding decisions). But there has been less discussion of how these constructions come about. Who designates the experts? Which methods are considered robust? Which forums confer legitimacy to communicated data? Whose funding decisions are influenced?",

We believe that health data and estimates at any level are only useful if they are demonstrably used to improve the health of individuals other than those (including ourselves) who make a comfortable living out of the health estimates industry.

We argue that health estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political and ideational contexts that differ at different levels of the global health architecture [22] .

Data and knowledge producers are driven by a variety of personal, professional and institutional incentives: the reward system for academics has little in common with that of national health authorities. These differences can affect the timing as well as the nature of knowledge production. The 'robustness' of a knowledge claim is similar to that of other constructions, such as a bridge. The more well-constructed pillars there are supporting a bridge, the more likely it is to be robust. Our confidence in the construction is increased after the bridge has been tested by a variety of vehicles in different weather conditions. Scientific knowledge is also constructed: the solidity of scientific achievements is a matter of alignment between data, arguments, interests, dominant values and circumstances [41] . The quality and validity of knowledge are made, and the 'robustness' of such constructions is tested, through ongoing debate, new research and the challenges that arise when the knowledge is acted upon. Scientists tend to consider a knowledge claim more robust when it is based upon more and increasingly specific data, and constructed using ever-improving technical methods. Scientific standards and norms are not always universally agreed even within the scientific community, however, hence the importance of transparency about methods and data, which allows others to test a knowledge claim. Once the 'knowledge' produced by scientists migrates outside of the research community, it faces a broader challenge: it must link up to what matters for those people who make decisions about health policy and practice in concrete local circumstances. In other words, it will be tested against social as well as scientific standards. If those standards have been taken into account when designing the pillars that underpin the new construction, that knowledge will function better in the real world. Knowledge is always linked to concrete practices and institutions, and has to be understood, accepted and trusted by real people in the broader context of their daily lives and beliefs. As Figure 2 illustrates, knowledge becomes more socially robust when more people, from more diverse communities and institutions with a wider variety of worldviews and practices, understand, accept and trust it, and find it useful for their own aims in their own situation.",

IHME is staffed by hundreds of well-trained data scientists and analysts who have access to teraflops of computer processing power; it is thus supremely well placed to develop new data processing and statistical modelling methods. Though feathers have been ruffled, especially among the international organisations that had enjoyed a near monopoly on technical expertise at the international level since global estimates became fashionable in the 1990s, IHME has done a great deal to push forward the technical frontiers of health estimates production. To this extent, their estimates compete with those of the WHO and other international organisations to be considered the most technically robust.

Consider the example of a journalist who is aware that an estimate in an academic report is the product of guesstimated data adjusted using an assumed parameter. They may not find that estimate particularly credible, but it may be useful to them because it provides comparability and comes with seductive visualisations. Another example: consider the case of local health officials who know that estimates made by academics are far more accurate than their own official reports, but who are unable to act on the 'credible' data because of local political constraints (a situation which arose, for example, during the outbreak of HIV among plasma donors in central China [39] ).",

These processes are in turn shaped on the demand side by the political and institutional cultures of potential users and their perceived need for the data. On the supply side, they are shaped by the constellation that is calling the shots intellectually, financially and institutionally. In short, the moment we become interested in the actual use of data and their contribution to action, we are forced to look beyond the technical and take into account the social robustness of data. Technical robustness is necessary, but it is not sufficient and does not exist in a vacuum; without people who are aware of, understand and accept data, they have no meaning. When we take into account the socio-political dimensions of knowledge, we are obliged to confront the fact that narrowly technical processes produce data that are only valued by very specific groups in very specific situations.",

Private organisations have every right to spend money supporting the analysis they believe they need to guide investment decisions.

Duplication occurs in part because international organisations and academic groups driven by a seemingly implacable need for comparable data are unwilling to accept from countries contributions which do not meet global definitions or standards. Using imputation and other statistical techniques, they substitute estimates made in Geneva or Seattle for those made in Ankara or Pretoria. One must assume that the groups publishing these substitute estimates consider them to be of better quality than the originals, perhaps because they have been technically validated. But substitute estimates are often made with minimal consultation with the people who provided the data which were fed into the maw of the multi-country modelpeople who could point out specificities, biases or alternative data sources that should be considered in interpreting the validity of the modelled outputs. Academic researchers from one African country gave an example: an international group estimated mortality at a figure lower than the number of deaths actually registered by the country's incomplete vital registration system. Local researchers suggested adjustments to data inputs based on their own granular knowledge of what is and is not captured in national health statistics. 'But we hit the roadblock of one size fits all. We were told: \"we can't change things just for [your country], it has to fit into this big global model\"' (academic researcher, Africa).",

'Of the 40 or so countries that account for 90% of child mortality, only a handful have functioning vital statistics systems,' noted a senior official from one international organisation. 'It's borderline criminal for donors to be bragging about anything having to do with data when their billions have left that kind of legacy.' In weaker countries, running complex computer programmes to generate 'data' intended to fill information gaps can form part of a vicious circle which leads to ever weaker health information. If underresourced ministries of health, planning or finance see apparently credible groups using computing power to make up estimates in the absence of measured data, they are unlikely to invest in health information systems. And without local engagement in data collection and interpretation, there's little chance that data will be understood and integrated into local systems of belief and action. It's worth noting that engaging data collectors in an active feedback loop probably increases the technical validity of the data also: nurses and other frontline workers who collect and report the raw information on which estimates should be based are more likely to fulfil that apparently peripheral task diligently if they see the data being used to improve service provision.",

Much locally produced data can be aggregated upwards to meet national and international needs. This is not always the case, however. (Brazil, for example, reports the percentage of women who have had seven antenatal visits rather than the globally standardised indicator based on four visits.)

We believe that's an argument for more consultation, not less. The widest possible engagement, including with academic institutions and civil society organisations at the national level, protects against lopsided political pressure. It also makes use of local knowledge; that's generally an improvement on the knowledge generated by a globally standardised computer programme.
