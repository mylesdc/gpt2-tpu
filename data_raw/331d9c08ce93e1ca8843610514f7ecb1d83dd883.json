It is very likely that the transmembrane domains (TMDs) or amino acid residues adjacent to the TMDs of viral fusion proteins, play a role in this process [2] . For instance, Influenza HA molecules that are anchored to a membrane through a GPI anchor in stead of their wild type TMD, are unable to complete the fusion process. Rather, membrane fusion is halted at the hemifusion stage [3] [4] [5] . In addition, it has been shown that glycine residues of the TMD of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), play a critical role in membrane fusion [6] . Furthermore, it has been shown that the membrane-proximal domain of GP41, the fusion protein of human immunodeficiency virus, is important for fusion activity [7, 8] . In particular, aromatic residues have been shown to be involved in the process of fusion pore dilation [7] . Likewise, palmitoylated cysteines, situated in or close to the viral membrane, have been implicated in the fusion process of coronavirus [9] [10] [11] [12] and influenza virus [13] . We have shown that the TMDs of coronavirus spike proteins are also crucial for membrane fusion activity. By swapping the TMD of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike for that of VSV-G, we have shown that both entry of SARS pseudoparticles (SARSpp) and SARS CoV spike protein mediated cell-cell fusion depends on the presence of the TMD of the spike [14] .",

These domains are highly conserved in all coronaviruses (see Figure 1A ). In this paper we describe an extensive mutagenesis study of the aromatic domain of SARS CoV S and the effect of these mutations on entry and fusion. In addition, we have tried to map the amino acids that are actually in the membrane by introducing a charged lysine residue at different positions in the predicted TMD region. We measured the capacity of the mutated spike proteins to mediate cell entry of virus like particles using our previously described SARSpp assay [14] . In addition, we determined the oligomeric state of the non-active mutants. The mutants concerning the aromatic domain were further analyzed using fluorescent dye transfer assays. The data presented here show that specific amino acids in or close to the TMD are crucial for membrane fusion activity of SARS CoV.",

By creating mutant S\u0394ARO, we wanted to investigate the importance of the aromatic domain in SARS S-mediated entry. Figure 2 shows that SARSpp, containing S \u0394ARO , are no longer capable of transducing Vero E6 cells, indicating that the aromatic domain is essential for the entry of the SARSpp. Moreover, when all the tryptophan residues in the aromatic domain were replaced for alanines, SARSpp were not infectious either, indicating that the alanines cannot take over the role of the tryptophans during SARS S mediated entry.

            "text": "Wimley and White have described an index on which the membrane interfaciality of amino acids has been ranked [16] . This index is indicative for the tendency of amino acids to participate in the interface of membranes and water. Tryptophan scores highest on this WW-index. Second in this ranking is phenylalanine. To investigate whether the high interfaciality of the tryptophans in the aromatic domain was important for the entry-mediating activity of the SARS S protein, we decided to replace one or more tryptophans for phenylalanine residues, creating mutants S W1\u2192F , S W12\u2192F , S W123\u2192F , S W2\u2192F , S W23\u2192F , S W3\u2192F , and S W13\u2192F . Figure 2A shows that replacing all three tryptophan residues for phenylalanine (mutant S W123\u2192F ) resulted in a total lack of SARSpp entry. Also the mutant S proteins containing two out of three phenylalanine in stead of tryptophan (mutants S W12\u2192F , S W23\u2192F , and S W13\u2192F ) were not capable of mediating entry of SARSpp. Only the mutants containing one phenylalanine replacing a tryptophan (S W1\u2192F , S W2\u2192F , and S W3\u2192F ) had some residual entry-mediating activity (up to 30% for S W2\u2192F ). This clearly shows that the tryptophan residues in the aromatic domain of SARS S play a very specific role during entry of SARSpp that cannot be taken over by the phenylalanine residues. Therefore, the high propensity to participate in the interface between water and membrane is probably not the only feature of the tryptophan residues that is involved in mediation of SARSpp entry, although it cannot be ruled out at this time. To exclude the possibility of a defect in protein maturation or incorporation into SARSpp, all aromatic domain mutants were analyzed for trimerization and incorporation efficiency. All mutants were incorporated efficiently into SARSpp and were able to trimerize ( Figures 2B and 2C) . ",

In particular, tryptophan residues have been implicated in the process of fusion pore dilation, i.e. the enlargement of a fusion pore [7, 8] . How this exactly works is poorly understood. We decided to test several mutants of the aromatic domain for their capacity to mediate cellcell fusion and induce fusion pore formation. For these particular experiments, we decided to use mutants of the aromatic domain in the context of a deleted C-terminus (S \u0394C27 ). This would yield a higher amount of S molecules on the surface of the cell, thereby potentially increasing the window of the cell-cell fusion assay [17] . Therefore, mutants S \u0394ARO /\u0394C27 and S W123\u2192A/\u0394C27 were created and used in a cell-cell fusion experiment, together with SWT and S \u0394C27 as controls. In Figure 3 , pictures are shown of syncytia, representative for the cultures, induced by S or mutant S molecules. SWT clearly induced rounded syncytia consisting of approximately 50 cells, as determined by the number of nuclei. S \u0394C27 was able to induce much larger, rounded syncytia, with at least twice as many nuclei as SWT, indicative for the high concentration of S \u0394C27 at the surface of the cell. In contrast, syncytia induced by S \u0394ARO /\u0394C27 and S W123\u2192A/\u0394C27 contained only a few cells and had an irregular shape, compared to SWT or S \u0394C27 induced syncytia. Cells seemed to form small groups, but with a different morphology than the positive controls, indicating that the cell-fusion mediating activity was altered. Rather, the cells seemed to stick together, yet not",

The number of amino acids between these two lysines is 33, whereas a typical TMD consists of approximately 16-20 amino acids. In an attempt to map the actual borders of the TMD of SARS S we constructed a range of S mutants in which extra lysine residues were introduced between the two previously mentioned lysines.

To check whether this phenotype was the result of the charge of the lysine, an alanine was inserted at the same position (Sins1202A).

Introduction of lysines at the positions A1204, and S1221 resulted in a severe reduction in fusion mediating capacity (\u2264 30%), whereas mutants SV1210K and S S1224K were hardly altered in their fusion mediating capacity. Both A1204 and S1221 are probably located in highly hydrophobic regions that do not tolerate a charged residue. Results with the S V1210K and S S1224K mutants suggest that the amino acids at these positions are in a less hydrophobic environment in which the charge is tolerated. This means that position 1210 is at the exact middle of the membrane, a place where charged residues can be tolerated [19] . Likewise, S1224, located downstream of the fourth cys residue of cys box 1, probably is not in the membrane, since the lysine was tolerated at that position.

The more tryptophans are lacking in the aromatic domain, the less active the spikes are in their entry-mediating capacity. In contrast, previously, mutant W1 \u2192 F was shown to be completely inactive (mutant W1194F, [20] ), whereas we found approximately 17% activity. This difference cannot be explained, but it is conceivable that a single mutant would exhibit residual activity, as compared to double or triple mutants. In Figures 3, 4 and 5, we show that mutants that do not have tryptophans in the aromatic domain, are unable to support entry of SARSpp, yet are capable of initializing membrane fusion, i.e. capable of forming a fusion pore. The aromatic domain of HIV GP41 has been suggested to be involved in dilation of the fusion pore [7, 8] . Saez-Cirion et al. have proposed two possible mechanisms by which the tryptophan residues might promote pore dilation. The first model is that the tryptophans enhance the transition between two lipidic stages of the fusion process. The second model is that the tryptophanes are involved in sequestering of multiple GP41 molecules to establish a proteinaceous ring thereby promoting the formation of a fusion pore [21] . Several studies are in support of the lipid model. Sainz Jr. et al have suggested that during the conformational changes in the spike the aromatic domain might align the fusion peptide and the TMD, thereby functioning as a hydrophobic sheet to allow lipid flow between the two fusing membranes [22] . Other reports have shown that peptides, representing the aromatic domain (of SARS CoV or HIV) are membrane active and are capable of altering the biophysical properties of membranes [21, [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, tryptophan residues have been shown to interact with cholesterol in the membrane, thereby modulating membrane curvature, possibly supporting lipidic intermediates during membrane fusion [26] . Both the HIV GP41 and SARS CoV S also contain a so-called CRAC motif (cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus) L/V-(X) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) -Y-(X) (1-5) -R/K, located upstream of the transmembrane domain, which might also be of importance during membrane fusion activity [27] [28] [29] [30] . The sequestering of the aromatic domain is supported by the study that showed oligomerization of HIV GP41 in solution [21] . Indeed, when expressed in bacteria, the SARS S aromatic domain forms hexamers in solution (J. Corver and W. Spaan, unpublished observation). It has also been shown that SARS CoV entry is dependent on the presence of lipid rafts [31] , which are known to be enriched in cholesterol, arguing for the importance of cholesterol during SARS CoV entry.",

Replacement of the tryptophans by phenylalanine residues resulted in a complete block of fusion (Figure 3, 4, 5) , suggesting that not only the interfaciality of the tryptophans is important, but also other features. In addition, we found that the distance between the aromatic domain and the TMD is critical, since insertion of one amino acid resulted in a block of entry (Sins1202K and Sins1202A). This suggests that the positioning of the aromatic domain relative to the hydrophobic domain is crucial for membrane fusion activity, a feature that was not yet included in the model that tries to explain the role of the aromatic domain in membrane fusion activity of coronaviruses. We therefore like to propose a model into which this new characteristic has been added.",

            "text": "Based on the results described above and on results published by others, we propose a mechanism in which the lateral flexibility of the aromatic domain, the TMD domain and the cys box 1 domain are pivotal for entry (membrane fusion activity) of SARSpp and most likely also SARS CoV. The model comprises the following steps (see Figure 7) : i) In the native mature spike protein, the aromatic domain is folded into the ectodomain of the spike. Previously, it has been shown that the aromatic domain in native, prefusion GP41 is already associated to the interface of the viral membrane [32] , forming the feet of the glycoprotein trimer tripod. However, the spikes on SARS CoV do not show these typical feet or a tripod like structure [33] . Therefore, it is possible that the position of the aromatic domain of SARS CoV S is different in the native conformation than in HIV GP41. The hydrophobic central TMD is in the membrane and the cys box 1 is outside the membrane, but closely associated to the membrane through the palmitic acids. ii) Once activated, the spike refolds and initiates fusion. It folds back to form the HR1-HR2 six helix bundle. As a result, the aromatic domain becomes associated to the membrane interface through its tryptophan residues, thereby pulling out the hydrophobic core of the TMD and thus iii) pulling in the cys box 1, which then partially becomes a transmembrane-like domain. Once released, the aromatic domain oligomerizes and consequently the S proteins cluster. The aromatic domain oligomerization also results in a clustering of cholesterol in the membrane, thereby inducing bending of the membrane with a negative curvature. Grouping of the S proteins, as induced by oligomerization of the aromatic domain, would also be necessary to establish pore dilation, i.e. the transition from a pore to a real fusion event, enabling large molecules to pass. Finally, as shown previously, the glycines present in the hydrophobic central domain of SARS CoV S also play an important role during entry [34] , possibly by mediating bends in the TMD needed for membrane fusion pore formation [6] .

In our model, we propose that the presence of the aromatic domain and the cysteine rich domain ensures a lateral flexibility of the S protein within the membrane, that is necessary for induction of membrane fusion. During this process, the positioning of the aromatic domain and the downstream amino acids relative to each other is another crucial prerequisite in the entry process of SARS CoV. ",
