As read-outs we used in vivo hepatotropic adenovirus challenge, histology and automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy (MELC). We show that targeted in vivo antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs is highly effective in inducing antiviral CTLs capable of eliminating virus-infected hepatocytes, while control vaccine formulation not involving DC targeting failed to induce immunity against hepatotropic virus. Moreover, we observed distinct patterns of CD8 + T cell interaction with virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes in the two DC-targeting groups suggesting that the different vaccine formulations may stimulate distinct types of effector functions. Our findings represent an important step toward the future development of vaccines against hepatotropic viruses and the treatment of patients with hepatic virus infection after liver transplantation to avoid reinfection.",

The predominantly tolerogenic microenvironment of the liver usually prevents the induction of immunity to these innocuous antigens while at the same time it favours the establishment of persistent liver infection 1,2 . Next to other hepatotropic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), a clinically highly relevant example for pathogens capable of establishing life-threatening chronic infections in the liver is the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3 . Despite extensive research since the discovery of HCV in 1989 4 , an effective vaccine is still not available 5 .",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) represent optimal targets for designing effective vaccines 6 . CD8\u03b1 + DCs are unique with respect to their capacity to effectively cross-present exogenous antigens on MHC-I molecules to induce cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in addition to Th1 responses 7,8 . Accordingly, CD8\u03b1 + DCs play a key role in establishing antiviral immunity 9,10 . Increasing knowledge regarding the characteristics of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) expression by different DC subsets has set the basis for a directed targeting of antigen in vivo by means of ligands or antibodies specific for the respective PRRs expressed on DCs. In this context, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) gained importance 11 . For instance, the TLR2/6 heterodimer agonist S-[2,3-bispalmitoyloxy-(2R)-propyl]-R-cysteinyl-amido-mono-methoxyl polyethylene glycol (BPPcysMPEG), a synthetic derivative of the macrophage-activating lipopeptide (MALP-2), effectively targets cross-presenting CD8\u03b1 + DCs. Importantly, co-administration of BPPcysMPEG together with soluble ovalbumin (OVA) (OVA + BPPcysMPEG) resulted in the induction of OVA-specific CTLs 12 . Interestingly, BPPcysOVAMPEG, a compound consisting of the immunodominant OVA peptides chemically linked to BPPcysMPEG and therefore specifically delivered to TLR2/6 positive DCs, was even more effective at inducing OVA-specific CTLs 12 .",

Importantly, receptor-mediated antigen uptake by CD8\u03b1 + DCs via DEC-205 results in extraordinarily effective antigen cross-presentation to CD8 + T cells [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Steinman and colleagues demonstrated that in vivo targeting of antigen to cross-presenting DCs by means of DEC-205-directed antibody-antigen conjugates together with the appropriate adjuvants resulted in a potent induction of specific T cell responses 19, 20 . Follow up studies with viral 14,16,17,21 , bacterial 22,23 and tumour antigens 24,25 proved DEC-205-mediated antigen delivery to CD8\u03b1 + DCs to elicit protective CD4 + and CD8 + T effector cells. However, no study so far addressed whether antigen delivery to cross-presenting CD8\u03b1 + DCs is able to induce effector T cell responses and antiviral immunity in the liver. To improve vaccination efficacy against hepatotropic viruses, we compared different vaccine formulations regarding their potency to induce antiviral effector T cell responses in the liver. This included targeted antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs by \u03b1 DEC-205 conjugated to the OVA protein (\u03b1 DEC-205/OVA adjuvanted with Poly(I:C)/CpG) and the less well studied BPPcysOVAMPEG containing the two immunodominant MHC-I and -II OVA peptides. To assess whether antigen targeting to DCs would be required for inducing antiviral effector T cells in the liver, another group that received OVA co-administered with BPPcysMPEG (OVA + BPPcysMPEG) and thus not involving targeted antigen delivery to DCs was included. We show that only immunization with the DC targeting formulation \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG but not OVA + BPPcysMPEG vaccination induced CD8 + effector T cells capable of eliminating virus infected hepatocytes. Thus, we conclude that targeted in vivo antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs represents a promising approach for the induction of antiviral immunity in the liver with potential implications for the development of vaccines against hepatotropic viruses.",

While hardly any IFN\u03b3 production was detectable in the hepatic CD44 -CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3C) , the AdOVA-GFP-luc challenge resulted in a nearly two-fold increase of the proportion of IFN\u03b3 -producing CD44 high CD8 + T cells in the OVA + BPPcysMPEG (11.3%) and Presence of IFN\u03b3 + CD44 high CD8 + effector T cells in the liver correlates with hepatitis development following AdOVA-GFP-luc challenge. We next asked whether the IFN\u03b3 -producing effector memory CD8 + T cells in the liver would respond to virus-expressed antigen on hepatocytes. While Ad-GFP-luc control infection induced only marginal hepatocellular cell death or cellular infiltrations (Fig. 4A) , infection of all OVA-immunized groups with AdOVA-GFP-luc led to drastic histological lesions in the liver, hepatocellular cell death and marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the tissue (Fig. 4A -C). Since histological scoring revealed a trend towards an enhanced immunopathology in the liver of \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA immunized and AdOVA-GFP-luc infected mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG group, we further elucidated whether \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination would result in distinct immune cell recruitment following viral infection. However, automated multidimensional fluorescent microscopy (MELC) on liver sections revealed no significant differences in the hepatic composition of leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, B cells and T cell subsets among the groups (Fig. 5A ,B and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Altogether, the observed type of immunopathology in \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice was indicative for acute hepatitis as a consequence of the immune-mediated clearance of virus infected hepatocytes suggesting that antigen-specific CTLs present in the liver following vaccination accounted for the hepatocyte damage.",

While we did neither observe significant differences in the number of virus infected hepatocytes, nor in the number of hepatocytes staining positive for active caspase-3 (Fig. 5C,D) or in the frequency of CD8 + T cells being in loose contact with infected hepatocytes (> 22 \u03bc m distance, Fig. 5E ), we indeed observed significantly fewer CD8 + T cells being in direct contact (< 9 \u03bc m) to AdOVA-GFP-luc infected hepatocytes in \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA immunized mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized group (Fig. 5E ). Strikingly, despite lower abundance of CD8 + T cells being in intimate contact with virus infected cells, substantially more of them were found to be closely associated with active caspase-3 and thus apoptotic cells in the liver of \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA immunized mice (Fig. 5E ). Together with the observation that compared to BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA immunization resulted in the accumulation of significantly higher frequency of IFN\u03b3 + CD44 high CD8 + effector T cells in virus infected livers (Fig. 3C ) these data may indicate that the two different DC-targeting formulations may indeed stimulate distinct types of effector functions being active during virus elimination from the liver.",

BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination, which was included as a novel antigen targeting system, exhibited outstanding properties in inducing high antibody titres (Fig. 1 ), Th1 and Th2 cells, as well as CTLs (Fig. 2 ) that effectively cleared virus infected hepatocytes (Fig. 6 ). Although not reaching statistical significance compared to \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA vaccination, this approach tended to promote a more robust viral clearance, as well as slightly less pronounced hepatocellular cell death and pro-inflammatory effect. The value of TLR agonist-antigen conjugates for inducing Th1 and CD8 + T cell responses are clearly underscored by our new data and previous studies 31, 32 . However, for clinical application such conjugates will need to be tailored to match different HLA alleles and rapidly mutating viruses (e.g. HCV) 33 . It could be possible to exploit chemical groups of BPPcysMPEG to generate conjugates with more complex antigens or to engineer universal docking systems enabling non-covalent binding, such as those used in the past for antibodies 34 .",

While we detected small numbers of CD44 + CD8 + memory T cells in the liver of OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection (Fig. 3) , these cells did not exert effector functions (Figs 2 and 6 ). These discrepancies may be due to differences in the antigen concentration used (3 mg vs. 7 \u03bc g) 12 . However, we have no explanation yet why the memory T cells present in the liver of OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice did not exhibit cytotoxic function. Strikingly, despite the lack of viral eradication in the OVA + BPPcysMPEG vaccinated group, these mice displayed marked immunopathology and elevated ALT levels following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection. We may speculate that, although being functionally impaired in terms of cytotoxicity, antigen-specific recognition of the virus by IFN\u03b3 + CD44 + CD8 + T cells results in cytokine release followed by innate immune activation and immune cell recruitment that finally result in hepatic cell death and inflammation independent of CTL mediated killing.",

            "text": "While in our hands both DC targeting approaches next to CTL responses induced a rather balanced Th1/Th2 profile, immunization with OVA + BPPcysMPEG that does not involve DC targeting failed to induce CTLs and resulted in a Th2 dominated cytokine profile (Figs 1C and 2) . Interestingly, BPPcysMPEG has been shown to induce Th1-type immune responses in the context of allergens and parasite antigens [36] [37] [38] . However, intramuscular immunization with hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particles co-administered with BPPcysMPEG resulted in a Th2 dominated response 39 . Therefore, the adjuvant dose, the route of administration and the intrinsic features of the antigen may account for the observed differences in the T helper cell phenotype. While Schulze and colleagues proved BPPcysMPEG to be a potent mucosal adjuvant for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the authors focused on the cellular and humoral immune responses, but did not test for antiviral activity 40 . Thus, BPPcysMPEG has not been investigated before regarding its potency to induce antiviral immunity. In the absence of DC targeting, i.e. by using the OVA + BPPcysMPEG formulation, we clearly show the induction of a Th2-biased CD4 + T cell phenotype, the lack of CTLs and in consequence no antigen-specific clearance of virus infected hepatocytes. While previous studies have demonstrated the exceptional potential of DEC-205-mediated antigen targeting to elicit adaptive immunity [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 24 to our knowledge this is the first study showing the induction of liver-specific immune reactions. We demonstrate that targeting DEC-205 + DCs resulted in a high frequency of local IFN\u03b3 + CD44 + CD8 + memory T cells (Fig. 3C) , which correlate with protection against adenovirus challenge in the liver (Fig. 6) . One critical point in fighting viral infections is to keep the balance between protective immunity and immunopathology, which are both mainly driven by CTLs and often decisive for the fate of the infected host 41, 42 . For hepatotropic viruses such as HCV, which is not believed to be directly cytopathic, liver damage is attributed to T cell-mediated immunity 29 and immunopathology is inevitable for sterilizing immunity. On the other hand, a less vigorous CTL response allows for viral persistence, ultimately leading to progressive tissue injury 43 . Only in the \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG group could immunopathology be correlated with antigen-specific viral clearance in the liver (Fig. 6) . Regarding the severity of hepatitis that occurs as a side effect of pathogen elimination, it is highly conceivable that \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice would have recovered from liver damage. In a published model of fulminant hepatic failure, ALT levels peaked at day 4-5 post infection, which was the end-point of the experiments in our study, and had almost normalized by day 6 post infection 44 . However, further studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of immune-mediated hepatitis.",

While a number of clinical trials indicated that CpG is sufficiently well tolerated, Poly(I:C) was shown to exhibit severe side effects in humans 45 . Of note, its synthetic derivative, PolyICLC, which has already been successfully used in DEC-205 targeting trials 46-48 exhibits a better resistance to hydrolysis as well as a greater potency to induce IFN\u03b3 -secreting T cells 49 than Poly(I:C) and, most importantly, was proven a safe adjuvant in healthy human volunteers 50 and in cancer patients 51, 52 . Additional studies are needed to clarify whether \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA vaccination using PolyICLC/CpG as an adjuvant will be as efficient as (or even more efficient than) \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA + Poly(I:C)/ CpG vaccination in inducing antiviral immunity in the liver. Regarding the TLR2/6 agonist BPPcysMPEG which is known to activate cross-priming CD8\u03b1 + DCs in mice, so far no published data are available for clinical applications. It has recently been shown that human CD141 + DCs which are thought to represent the functional equivalent of mouse CD8\u03b1 + DCs do express TLR2 and 6 53 . Thus, an interaction of BPPcysOVAMPEG with DCs via the TLR2/6 receptors is likely to take place also in humans. Nevertheless, future in vitro studies are needed to clarify this issue in more detail.",

            "text": "We observed distinct patterns of CD8 + T cell interaction with virus infected and apoptotic hepatocytes, dependent on the vaccine formulation we used (Fig. 5C-E) . While significantly fewer CD8 + T cells were in intimate contact with virus infected hepatocytes in the \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA-immunized group, these CD8 + T cells appear to be more effective in inducing apoptosis which is in line with the higher expression of IFN\u03b3 as a marker for their cytotoxic potential. It is well established that CTLs eliminate infected hepatocytes after direct antigen recognition on target cells via perforin/granzyme or Fas-mediated killing. However, cytotoxicity in virus infected hepatocytes can also be exerted via the non-canonical CTL effector function where CTLs are stimulated by cross-presenting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and secrete TNF after stimulation 54 . TNF induces cell death specifically in infected hepatocytes involving caspase-3 activation following TNFR stimulation. Of note, well in line with the observed elevated frequencies of IFN\u03b3 + CD44 + CD8 + CTL in AdOVA-GFP-luc infected livers of \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA compared to BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice, the overall IFN\u03b3 and as well TNF expression levels were by far higher in the \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA treated group (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). IFN\u03b3 secreted by highly abundant IFN\u03b3 + CD44 + CD8 + CTL may account for elevated TNF expression in hepatic macrophages in AdOVA-GFP-luc infected \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA immunized mice. Alternatively, as shown before by Wohlleber et al. 54 , virus-specific CTLs induced during \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA may be the source of TNF. While further investigation is needed to decipher the specific mechanisms underlying the elimination of virus infected hepatocytes in \u03b1 DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccinated mice, we may speculate that immune surveillance in \u03b1 DEC-205/ OVA immunized mice in addition to cell-contact dependent CTL-mediated killing to a higher degree involves cytokine-mediated effector functions. At first line TNF may be the most important cytokine involved in elimination of virus infected hepatocytes as it can induce apoptosis in adenovirus infected hepatocytes. Although IFN\u03b3 has been shown to exert non-cytolytic antiviral effector function in HBV infected hepatocytes 55 , previous reports have shown that IFN\u03b3 ko mice behave exactly the same as wildtype mice with regards to antiviral immune response against adenovirus infected hepatocytes and following liver damage 28, 54 . This does not exclude that high levels of IFN\u03b3 may enhance secondary antiviral effects for example by the upregulation of antigen-presentation by hepatocytes enhancing recognition of infected cells by CTLs.",

A hallmark of e.g. HCV persistence is the appearance of functionally impaired and exhausted T cells that are unable to secrete antiviral effector molecules, show impaired proliferation 29, 56, 57 and dysregulate expression of activating/inhibitory receptors [58] [59] [60] . Next to this, in patients chronically infected with HCV the higher frequency of suppressive CD4 + CD25 + T regulatory cells 61 most likely contribute to T cell dysfunction. Since blocking of PD-1, CTLA-4 and Tim-3 hold some therapeutic promise for the functional recovery of exhausted T cells 59,60,62 , a combined strategy encompassing both antibody-mediated blocking of immunosuppressive pathways together with boosting antiviral immunity by means of DEC-205-or TLR-mediated antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs could represent a promising scenario for future developments. This may also imply the use of DC targeting as a therapeutic vaccine, which has been shown to be clearly effective in several other studies 14, 21, 25 , and might also contribute to the treatment of patients with hepatic virus infection after liver transplantation to avoid reinfection.",

Excess of TCEP and sulfo-SMCC in the respective samples was removed using Zeba Desalt Spin Columns, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The reduced OVA was immediately mixed with the activated antibody and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C.
