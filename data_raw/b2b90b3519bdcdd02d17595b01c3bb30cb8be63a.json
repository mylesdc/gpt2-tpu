            "text": "Result: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens. The antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Antigens were targeted for expression in either the cytoplasm or the outer membrane. Combinations of strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of combined delivery/expression approaches. After investigating in vitro and in vivo antigen expression, growth and infection abilities; the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains was evaluated in mice. Using the soluble model antigen EGFP, our results indicated that vaccine strains with high and stable antigen expression exhibited high B cell responses, whilst eukaryotic expression or colonization with good construct stability was critical for T cell responses. For the insoluble model antigen HA, an outer membrane expression strategy induced better B cell and T cell responses than a cytoplasmic strategy. Most notably, the combination of two different expression strategies did not increase the immune response elicited. Conclusion: Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages and deleterious or synergistic effects. Different construction strategies were optimally-required for soluble versus insoluble forms of the protein antigens. If an antigen, such as EGFP, is soluble and expressed at high levels, a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended; since it provokes the highest B cell responses and also induces good T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic expression plasmid or a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective. For insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is recommended.",

            "text": "Keywords: Salmonella Typhimurium, Live oral vaccine, Soluble and insoluble antigens, Construction strategies, Immunological comparison Background Over recent years, there has been considerable interest in the use of attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strains as live oral vaccines against heterologous antigens or infectious agents [1, 2] . Notable advantages to their use include their ability to induce antigen-specific mucosal, humoral and cellular responses after infecting the host via mucosal routes [3] [4] [5] . Salmonella strains can be orally administrated, via food or drinking water, which avoids the use of injections for vaccine delivery. Furthermore, vaccine strains may be conveniently and reliably generated in large quantities by standard cell culture-based approaches, which considerably lowers the manufacturing costs [6] . Consequently, many different strategies have been utilized for the development of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines against various heterologous antigens. Some of these approaches utilize episomal expression systems, where high or low copy plasmids are used to express heterologous antigen or epitope genes under the control of various different promoter systems [7] [8] [9] [10] . The antigenic proteins may be retained within the cell cytoplasm after expression, or may be targeted to cell surface (outer membrane) of the attenuated Salmonella strains. For example, the Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and codon-optimized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein have both been expressed in the cytoplasm of attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium cells via high copy plasmids, for use as live oral vaccine candidates against Streptococcus pneumonia or the H5N1 virus [7, 8] , respectively. A high copy ice-nucleation protein (Inp) derived surface-expressed system was employed to produce a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against hepatitis B virus, while a low copy OmpA-derived surface display system was used to develop a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against HIV [9, 10] . All of these vaccines were demonstrated to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses. In other studies, heterologous genes have been expressed in the cytoplasm of attenuated Salmonella via chromosome-based expression cassettes. For instance, a live recombinant Salmonella strain containing a chromosomally-encoded SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene expressed sufficient cytoplasmic protein to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV [11] . Salmonella has also been employed as a live delivery vector for eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring antigen genes. This strategy may avoid problems such as codon bias or low levels of antigen expression. Using this approach, live recombinant Salmonella was used to deliver an HA DNA vaccine against the H9N2 virus, and a VP28 DNA vaccine against the white spot syndrome virus in crayfish [12, 13] .",

Animal tests suggested that the vaccine strain containing the chromosome-based expression system induced a stronger humoral immune response than the one containing the plasmid-based expression system [14] . Similarly, in efforts to construct a live oral Salmonella-HIV vaccine, the HIV rgp120 antigen was expressed cytoplasmically using either a chromosome-based cassette, a high copy plasmid, or in the outer membrane via an OmpA expression system.

Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines. To directly address this issue, we construct analogous sets of live recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains expressing two model antigens: enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the hemagglutinin epitope (residues 91-261, HAOP) from H5N1 virus (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004), via different commonly used strategies. Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of these strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages, as well as deleterious or synergistic effects. The construction strategies of recombinant Salmonella vaccine strains for various needs and different forms of antigens (soluble or insoluble antigens) were also proposed. strategy in a single chromosomal or episomal context, respectively (Table 1) . Strains HP, LP and CP were each designed to express EGFP in the cytoplasm of Salmonella from a high copy plasmid, low copy plasmid or chromosome-based prosseA expression cassette, respectively. Strains HO and CO were designed to express EGFP on the outer membrane of SL7207 from a high copy plasmid, or a chromosome-based prosseA-lpp-ompA outer membrane expression cassette, respectively. Strain E carried a high-copy eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP driven by a eukaryotic cmv promoter. Consequently, EGFP would not be expected to be expressed in significant amounts until pEGFP was released into cells of the eukaryotic host. HP and HO sub-groups were constructed by using the high copy number plasmid with pUC origin as backbone. These plasmids exist in about 500-700 copies in one bacterial cell [17] . Low copy number plasmid sub-group LP was constructed using p15A origin in the backbone. The plasmid exists in 10-12 copies per bacterial cell [17] . Chromosomebased sub-groups CP and CO were constructed by lambda red recombineering [18] which resulted in only one copy of EGFP expressing cassette in one bacterial cell. The high-copy eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP also uses pUC origin as backbone.",

Since no fluorescence was observable for the CO strain, EGFP expression was confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 1C ). This revealed that the EGFP gene was being translated within the CO strain. Because EGFP would not be expressed in significant amounts until pEGFP in strain E was released into eukaryotic cells, we detected its expression at different time points in vitro and in vivo, respectively, using Western blotting. In vitro, the EGFP expression was detected by infecting the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line with E strain. Figure 1D showed that EGFP could be successfully delivered into eukaryotic cells by E strain in vitro, and its expression was found within the eukaryotic cells at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection. Furthermore, the EGFP expression delivered by E strain was also investigated in mice intestine on day 1, 3 and 7 after inoculation of 1 \u00d7 10 11 bacterial cells.

The doubling times of the HP, LP, CP, HO, CO and E strains were 33.2 \u00b1 4.0, 39.2 \u00b1 1.5, 44.2 \u00b1 2.6, 38.9 \u00b1 3.0, 52.5 \u00b1 2.6 and 33.0 \u00b1 3.0 minutes, respectively.

Comparing the six recombinant strains, the growth rate of the chromosome-based outer-membrane strain CO was considerably slower than that of the other five strains (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the growth rates of strains containing high or low copy-EGFP plasmids were also compared with those of strains containing the corresponding empty vectors. Strains HP and E exhibited similar growth rates to the strains containing the corresponding empty vectors BSK (35.0 \u00b1 1.4 min) and VAX-1 (31.2 \u00b1 1.9 min). This indicated that the metabolic burden associated with maintaining the pBSK and pVAX-1 high copy plasmids was primarily responsible for the increase in doubling times for the HP and E strains. The growth rates of the LP and HO strains were considerably different to those of the corresponding empty-vector strains ACYC177 (42.8 \u00b1 1.7 min, p < 0.01) and OmpA (35.8 \u00b1 1.2 min, p < 0.05).

Therefore, we chose the HA epitope (91aa-261aa) from the avian influenza H5N1 virus as a second model antigen. Considering the codon bias between Salmonella and influenza virus, the gene sequence encoding the HA fragment (HAOP) was first codon optimized for expression within Salmonella, and prepared synthetically by a commercial supplier (GenScript).

For outer membrane expression, HAOP was subcloned into the pHO plasmid to generate pO-HAOP. These two constructs were separately transformed into SL7207, to create a cytoplasmic HA expression strain of Salmonella (C-HAOP) as well as an outer-membrane HA expression strain of Salmonella (O-HAOP). The expression of HAOP in these two recombinant strains was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As may be seen in Figure 5A , HAOP was highly expressed within the C-HAOP strain, being present almost exclusively in the pellet fraction after cell lysis. This indicates that it may be predominantly localized within insoluble inclusion bodies in the cell cytoplasm. For the strain O-HAOP, Western blot analysis of cell-membrane extracts demonstrated that the expressed HAOP was associated with the outer membrane ( Figure 5B ).",

Here, we used EGFP as a model antigen to study the relationship between immunogenicity and the use of different antigen expression systems in Salmonella. Six recombinant strains, including three cytoplasmic expression strains (HP, LP and CP); two outer-membrane expression strains (HO, CO) and one eukaryotic expression plasmid (strain E), were constructed. Several different pairs of EGFP-expression systems were combined, to produce five additional 'double-recombinant' strains. The antigen expression levels; in vitro and in vivo growth and infection abilities; and the immunogenic properties of these single and double-recombinant strains in mice; were systematically investigated, in order to evaluate their respective advantages, and to identify deleterious or synergistic effects.",

Although the EGFP expression levels in the LP strain (containing the lowcopy pLP plasmid) were lower than those in the HP strain, LP elicited a better B cell response, which is probably due to high EGFP expression and improved plasmid stability in vitro and in vivo. The CP strain, which contains a (single-copy) chromosome-based expression cassette, produced lower levels of EGFP expression than the HP and LP strains, and induced a weaker B cell response rate than these two strains. Out of the two single-recombinant strains designed for outer membrane expression, the HO strain, which harbors the high copy number pHO plasmid, expressed higher levels of EGFP than the chromosome-based CO strain in vitro, and also elicited better B cell response rate. The EGFP expression levels in the HO strain were lower than those in HP or LP, the high copy plasmid pHO showed poor in vivo stability (as did pHP), and it also induced a weaker B cell response than the LP strain. The B cell response rate against the E strain, which harbors a eukaryotic expression plasmid, were weaker than those raised by the HP, LP and HO strains; most likely because the EGFP cannot be expressed until pEGFP has entered a host cell. In addition, the eukaryotic plasmid expression levels may not be as high as those generated by Salmonella strains containing high or low copy prokaryotic plasmids. Taken together, these findings suggest the strength of the humoral immunity responses in mice infected with recombinant Salmonella vaccines were positively correlated to antigen expression levels and plasmid stability. Therefore, maintaining high and stable antigen expression levels in recombinant Salmonella strains is of key importance for eliciting a strong B cell response. Furthermore, our results indicate that strains containing low copy prokaryotic plasmids are capable of generating highest B cell responses with relative high antigen expression level and improved stability over high-copy plasmids.",

Plasmids with various copy numbers have been used [26, 27] . In several cases, such as the construction of live attenuated Salmonella oral vaccines against Streptococcus pneumonia, the H5N1 virus or hepatitis B virus; the antigens of interest expressed from high copy prokaryotic plasmids were able to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses [7] [8] [9] . However, many of these vaccine strains had either negligible or fairly low immunogenicity, due to the instability of the high copy plasmid, or toxic effects induced by the unregulated high-level expression of these heterologous antigens [28] [29] [30] . Plasmids may be stably maintained in Salmonella cells during in vitro growth via the use of the appropriate antibiotic. However, the loss of high copy plasmids may easily occur once Salmonella infects and grows inside the host, due to the absence of antibiotic selection pressure; thereby resulting in reduced antigen expression levels and decreased immunogenicity in vivo. Also, the unregulated high level expression of antigen may create a significant metabolic burden, or even toxicity for the Salmonella cell, thus creating a selective pressure for high copy plasmid segregation during cell division [27] . Here, the LP strain, which contained a low copy plasmid, exhibited relatively high EGFP expression levels with improved in vitro and in vivo stability, compared with strains containing high copy plasmids. This strain induced the highest levels of B cell immunogenicity (Table 4 and Figures 2B, 3 and 4) . This result is similar to those reported in previous studies, which have found that lowering the plasmid copy number results in enhanced plasmid stability and a reduction in the expression levels of heterologous antigens to non-toxic levels [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

In this and other studies, homologous recombination has been used to insert a heterologous antigen expression cassette into the Salmonella chromosome, resulting in the creation of recombinant strains with good in vitro and in vivo stabilities (Table 4 and Figure 3 ) [35, 36] . However, as the heterologous gene is present as a single copy per bacterium, the expression levels may be too low to effectively induce a B cell response. In this study, the poor B cell responses against the chromosome-based expression strains CP and CO were probably due to the low levels of EGFP expression ( Figures 2B and 4A ). Similar findings have been previously reported. For example, during efforts to develop a live Salmonella oral vaccine against fragment C of the tetanus toxin (TetC), the recombination of TetC into the aroC gene of S. typhimurium created a strain with good stability; however low TetC expression levels resulted in poor immunogenicity. One possible way to increase expression levels would be to insert multiple copies of the heterologous antigen genes into chromosome.",

            "text": "Salmonella has been used as a delivery vector for eukaryotic plasmids for more than ten years [37] [38] [39] [40] . In these DNA vaccines, the plasmid encoding the target antigen gene is placed under the control of a eukaryotic promoter. Theoretically, Salmonella delivered-mucosal DNA vaccines can invade the Peyer's patches via M cells in the intestinal mucosa, which contain many antigenpresenting cells (APCs); such as macrophages and dendritic cells [41] . Once phagocytized by the APCs, the recombinant Salmonella cells would be lysed within the phagosomes, releasing the eukaryotic plasmids into the APCs. The APCs would then express the plasmidencoded antigen and present them to CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in the Peyer's patches or mesenteric lymph nodes via MHC I and MHC II molecules. In addition, the APCs may directly secrete the recombinant antigens from the cells, so that B cells can recognize them via B cell receptors (BCRs). This process induces further mucosal, humoral or cellular immune responses against the heterologous antigen [38, [42] [43] [44] [45] . Many studies have found that Salmonella delivered DNA vaccines were particularly good at generating T cell responses against foreign antigens. In this project, we constructed a Salmonella-DNA vaccine strain (strain E) which contains a high copy eukaryotic plasmid (pEGFP). Using Western blotting, we confirmed that pEGFP plasmid delivered by the E strain could be used to successfully express EGFP in mice intestinal mucosal sites on day 1 after inoculation ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, we found that this Salmonella-eukaryotic plasmid-based system could induce better T cell responses than the Salmonella-highcopy-prokaryotic plasmid-based systems ( Figure 4C) ; However, its antibody responses were quite low ( Figure 4A ). Analogous findings have previously been reported. In one comparative study, it was shown that an oral Salmonella DNA vaccine strain encoding \u03b2galactosidase induced better T helper cell and CTL responses than oral immunization with a Salmonella strain containing a prokaryotic plasmid-encoded \u03b2-galactosidase gene [38] . Similarly, oral immunization with the surface protein from the hepatitis B virus delivered by a Salmonella DNA vaccine elicited good T cell responses, but its B cell responses were quite low [46] . Based on our and others' comparative analyses, we consider it likely that the endogenously produced antigen delivered by the Salmonella-DNA vaccine may generate immune responses mainly through the MHC I pathway, thus resulting in higher T cell responses but lower B cell responses.",

            "text": "ELISpot results suggested that a chromosome-based expression system (CP strain) could also generate better T cell responses than strains containing high copy prokaryotic plasmids. Furthermore, results from the in vivo survival, infection ability and construct stability assays (Figure 3) , indicated that the CP strain had better survival abilities and construct stability than strains containing high copy plasmids. These findings indicated that colonization with recombinant vaccine strains with good construct stability is also an important factor for eliciting strong T cell responses. This is most likely due to the following reasons: T cell responses against Salmonella infection can be effectively induced only after the recombinant cells have invaded and proliferated within the APCs [47] . However, after oral administration, the bacterial cells would be in a low-nutrient environment that lacked antibiotic selective pressure. They would also be subjected to acidic conditions within the GI tract (even if this was partially negated by sodium bicarbonate lavage) as well as attack by the host immune defenses. Consequently, non-integrating (episomal) plasmids would be lost fairly rapidly as observed in survival, infection ability and construct stability analyses (Figure 3) , thereby greatly reducing the abilities of the bacterium to synthesize antigen protein in vivo. Chromosome-based strains such as CP avoid this problem, albeit at the price of reduced antigen expression levels. Even though the chromosome-based CO strain showed in vivo stabilities equivalent to the CP strain, its T cell responses were lower. It is possible that the membrane-expressed EGFP significantly slowed the growth rate of the CO strain (Table 2) , resulting in poorer in vivo survival and proliferation abilities (colonization ability), compared to the CP strain ( Figure 3A) .",

In this regard, the properties of the LP strain are worth commenting on. Even though its induced T cell responses were not as high as those elicited by the E and CP strains, it could simultaneously induce both B cell and T cell responses. It also exhibited better in vivo stability than the strains containing high copy plasmids ( Figure 3) . Consequently, if the aim was to develop a vaccine strain capable of inducing both B cell and T cell responses, then the use of a low copy cytoplasmic expression system may be desirable.",

Consequently, we created five double-recombinant strains (CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E, E + LP). We used CP and E as the starting strains for the construction of these five dual-expression systems, using compatible plasmid replication origins and orthogonal antibiotic resistance genes. The CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and E + LP strains were designed to elicit both stronger B cell and T cell responses. The CP + E strain was constructed to investigate whether it could generate a T cell response that was higher than those of the two individual strains. Contrary to our initial expectations, both the humoral and T cell immune responses against these five double-recombinant strains were not markedly improved, some of them were obviously worse than their individual parent strains (Figure 4) . There are several possible reasons for this lack of synergy: first, the combination increased the frequency of plasmid loss. According to our in vitro plasmid stability studies (Table 5) , we found that the detection rates for pHP in the CP + HP strain, pHO in the CP + HO strain and pEGFP in the E + LP strain were 0.8%, 60.0% and 50.0%, respectively. This suggested that the high copy plasmids were more easily displaced in the double-recombinant strains, resulting in a decrease in EGFP expression levels ( Figure 2B) and B cell responses ( Figure 4A and B) . Second, antibiotic selection pressure was increased. To maintain the plasmids, we used relatively high concentrations of two antibiotics during the subculturing procedures. However, the high-copy plasmids, containing pUC replication origins, were still frequently lost from the cells. Upon losing the plasmid, the relevant antibiotic will become toxic to the cell, resulting in significantly decreased growth rates for the five double-recombinant strains (Tables 2 and 3 ). It would also cause an increase in 'stress' for the cell, resulting in defects in replication and other growth-related effects; which were manifested in the frequent formation of filamentous cells (Figure 2A ) [48] [49] [50] . Furthermore, even though the high-copy plasmids were not lost from some of the recombinant Salmonella strains in vitro; as was noted for the HO, E and CP + E strains (Tables 4 and 5) , cell elongation was still observed (Figure 2A ). This may be due to the 'metabolic burden' [51] [52] [53] caused by the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell, leading to decreases in its overall immunogenic properties.",

            "text": "As the expression abilities of Salmonella are relatively similar to those of Escherichia coli, this prokaryotic system may not be suitable for the expression of protein antigens from viruses or higher eukaryotes [38] . Consequently, when constructing a vaccine strain against a virus such as avian influenza H5N1, several factors must be taken into consideration. The first is codon bias; however this may be easily resolved by gene synthesis, using the codons preferred by Salmonella. The second problem is the inability to express soluble antigen within the cytoplasm, or to target it to the cell surface in a correctly folded form. Many antigens from eukaryotic viruses, such as the HA protein from H5N1, cannot be readily expressed in a soluble form within the cytoplasm of Salmonella [8] . This type of situation can dramatically decrease the B cell and T cell immune response within the infected host. According to our in vivo immune response assays, no detectable B cell or T cell responses could be detected when mice were immunized with the C-HAOP strain, which was designed to cytoplasmically express the HA antigen.",

            "text": "It has previously been reported that expressing the antigen protein on the outer membrane of the engineered bacterial cells may increase the immune response [54] , since this may increase the likelihood of recognition by the host immune system. To investigate this issue, we targeted the EGFP protein for outer membrane expression using the lpp-ompA outer membrane expression system. Analogous outer membrane expression cassettes were located on a high-copy plasmid (HO strain) and on the chromosome (CO strain). The B cell responses ( Figure 4A ) against these two strains were weaker than those obtained for the LP strain; and the T cell responses ( Figure 4C ) against the HO strain were lower than those obtained for the E and CP strains. This may be because the total amounts of EGFP synthesized and exported to the outer membrane were too low to induce an effective B cell response ( Figure 2B ), or because the in vivo stabilities of the high copy plasmids were not sufficient to induce an effective T cell response ( Figure 3 ). However, this strategy proved somewhat more successful for the HA antigen, which appears to be largely present in insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of Salmonella. We found that the use of the lpp-ompA system, which is present in the O-HAOP strain, resulted in the successful export of HA antigen to the outer membrane fraction ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, results from ELISA, HIA and ELISpot assays indicated this strain of Salmonella was capable of inducing better HA-specific B cell and T cell responses than the corresponding C-HAOP strain, which expresses the HA antigen in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5C , D and E). It is possible that the use of the Lpp-OmpA system either helps the HA protein fold into a soluble conformation, or results in the export of increased amounts of HA protein, causing notable enhancements in immunogenicity.",

Our results indicate that if the antigen (such as EGFP) is soluble and easily expressed in Salmonella, a low-copy plasmid-based strategy should be employed, as it can provoke better B cell responses and can also induce T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic plasmid, or chromosome-based expression strategy may achieve better results. For heterologous antigens that are likely to be expressed in an insoluble form within Salmonella (such as HA), an outer membrane-targeting approach is recommended. In addition, we found that the combination of two expression strategies did not enhance the immune response, and hence we caution against the use of such an approach.",
