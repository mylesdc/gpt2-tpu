            "text": "Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus presenting a public health threat in North America. POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWVspecific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P \u03ed 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection.",

As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown. KEYWORDS Powassan virus, deer tick virus, enzyme immunoassay, flavivirus, immunofluorescence, serology, tick-borne disease, tick-borne encephalitis P owassan virus (POWV) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis complex (TBE-C) of viruses, which are transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Other members of the TBE-C include the following flaviviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus in Siberia, Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India, Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia, and Louping ill virus in the United Kingdom. TBE-C viruses can cause a wide range of disease in humans, from mild febrile illness with biphasic fever to encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever (1) . POWV is composed of two genetically and ecologically distinct lineages (2) . Prototype POWV (lineage I) is transmitted primarily by Ixodes cookei, a tick with a narrow vertebrate host range that rarely feeds on humans. Powassan virus lineage II, also known as deer tick virus (DTV), is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, a tick with a broad host range that also transmits the infectious agents that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis (3) . Since the late 1990s, POWV infections have been reported in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States as well as in Canada, and incidence is increasing (4) . Because the territory of I. scapularis is expanding and the prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, POWV poses an increasing threat (5, 6) . In a recent survey, I. scapularis ticks collected from the northwest quadrant of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2012 demonstrated a POWV infection frequency of 4.67% (7) . This is similar in frequency to a survey conducted in that same area in 1998 (8) . Although POWV is rarely diagnosed as a cause of encephalitis, infections can be severe, and neurologic sequelae are common (9) . Additionally, the potential for concurrent transmission with other tick-borne pathogens, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has not been previously studied in North America.",

            "text": "Studies confirm that serologic cross-reactions among the flaviviruses are significant and more frequently observed with IgG antibody detection assays. Both commercial EIAs and IgG IFAs demonstrate poor specificity overall, with IFA being slightly better than EIA. The overall specificity of flavivirus IgG EIAs is reported between 16 and 38% and improves slightly to 29 to 84% for IgG IFAs (12) . The addition of the POWV IgG IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 35% of the cross-reactivity seen with the EIA alone. The immunological maturation of the IgG antibody response tends to foster the formation of antibodies directed to epitopes with greater likelihood for cross-reactivity (13) . While the specificity of flavivirus PRNTs detecting neutralizing IgG antibodies is high, this often comes at the cost of assay sensitivity. A PRNT 50 tends to be more sensitive in detecting early antibody responses, given the less stringent endpoint of \u03fe50% reduction in plaques, versus the highly specific \u03fe90% plaque reduction described here (14) . Also, low correlation between PRNT and IFA titer is not surprising since the IFA detects antibodies to a variety of structural and nonstructural viral proteins, whereas the PRNT primarily detects neutralizing antibodies directed to the envelope (E) protein of the virus (13) . When tested against non-tick-borne flavivirus samples, the POWV IgG IFA described here demonstrated an analytical specificity of 65%, comparable to that of other commercial flavivirus IgG IFAs (15). The overall cross-reactivity associated with detection of flavivirus IgM antibodies is significantly lower than that seen with IgG antibodies, and IgM IFA specificity was 20 to 30% higher than IgM EIA when patients with suspected flavivirus infections were screened for several different viruses (12) . The addition of the POWV IgM IFA to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 55% of the cross-reactivity seen with the IgM EIA alone. Many commercially available flavivirus IgM-specific serologic tests report sensitivity lower than that seen with IgG assays, due primarily to the fact that PRNT is considered the gold standard for the differential serodiagnosis. Published reports confirm that, in patients with primary flavivirus infection, the IgM response likely consists of antibodies with minimal to no virus-neutralizing capacity (16, 17) . In a study assessing the performance of a commercially available WNV IgM EIA, 14 of 44 CDC IgM protocolnegative samples were found positive. The apparent lack of IgM specificity observed with that assay may be attributed to the use of PRNT to confirm IgM positives as part of the CDC protocol (18) . In studies where convalescent-phase samples can be collected from patients 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the use of PRNT may be helpful to confirm the accuracy of acute-phase detection of IgM. In the studies presented here, we were limited by design to samples collected only at the time of clinical presentation, and therefore, follow-up convalescent-phase samples were not available. The lack of a reliable and accurate predicate assay for use as a gold standard when developing flavivirus IgM assays requires further study. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a single IgM-positive result for arboviral diagnosis is considered a presumptive positive and should be confirmed by RT-PCR, virus isolation, and/or PRNT to discriminate potentially cross-reactive antibodies (19) . In the current study, one POWV IgM IFA-positive sample was confirmed positive by POWV RT-PCR with the remaining IgM IFA-positive samples lacking detectable viral genome. Studies performed with WNV-positive patients show that viremia can be detected for an average of 7 days and that IgM antibody becomes detectable a median of 4 days after the midpoint of the interval for RNA detection, for an overlap of only 1 to 2 days (20) . Therefore, RT-PCR cannot function as a sensitive confirmatory assay for IgM-positive samples across all time points. The current state of diagnostics for POWV infection includes initial serological testing performed using IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IgG ELISA with confirmatory testing utilizing PRNT, a 4-fold or greater increase in antibody titer between acute-and convalescent-phase sera, virus isolation, or detection of virus-specific RNA. Only a few state health labs and the CDC offer this testing, and the labor-intensive nature of the confirmatory tests often delays the reporting of final results beyond the period of clinical utility. In addition, testing is usually limited to patients presenting with neurologic complications; therefore, little is known regarding the overall prevalence of and clinical symptoms associated with POWV infection. Limited data regarding cocirculation of Lyme disease and POWV seroprevalence in the Midwest have been published (21) . The test panel described here allows for the simple and efficient detection of acute POWV infection. However, due to the cross-reactivity seen for all flavivirus IgG assays, it is imperative that exposure to other flaviviruses and travel and vaccination history be considered when interpreting IgG test results. This panel is a diagnostic tool that can play an important role in further defining the full spectrum of POWV disease.",

Analytical sensitivity was determined using the arbovirus encephalitis panel. Analytical specificity was calculated as (true negatives)/(true negatives \u03e9 false positives) \u03eb 100. The limit of detection was calculated as the lowest PRNT 90 titer detected in the POWV IgG assay. Analytical specificity was determined using the HF sample set. Seroprevalence was calculated for each of the TBD, non-TBD, and control sample sets. Due to the inability of PRNT 90 to be used for confirmation of POWV IgM and the lack of cross-reactivity seen with the HF samples, samples that were POWV IgM IFA positive or POWV IgG positive and confirmed by PRNT 90 were presumed to be true positives. For samples that were negative for POWV IgM by IFA, POWV IgG was considered a false positive if WNV IgG EIA was positive or PRNT 90 was negative.",
