Although pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, the role of SGs in regulating PSC self-renewal and differentiation has not been fully elucidated. Here we found that sodium arsenite (SA) and HS, but not hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), induce SG formation in human induced (hi) PSCs. Particularly, we found that these granules contain the well-known SG proteins (G3BP, TIAR, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3B, eIF4G, and PABP), were found in juxtaposition to processing bodies (PBs), and were disassembled after the removal of the stress. Moreover, we showed that SA and HS, but not H 2 O 2 , promote eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in hiPSCs forming SGs. Analysis of pluripotent protein expression showed that HS significantly reduced all tested markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, L1TD1, and LIN28A), while SA selectively reduced the expression levels of NANOG and L1TD1. Finally, in addition to LIN28A and L1TD1, we identified DPPA5 (pluripotent protein marker) as a novel component of SGs. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular cues of hiPSCs responses to environmental insults.",

            "text": "SGs are sites of non-translating messenger ribounucleoproteins (mRNPs) aggregation under stress conditions. Those aggregates selectively store transcripts encoding housekeeping genes, but not those encoding stress-induced genes, as well as a wide variety of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are involved in many different metabolic and signaling pathways in the cell [11] [12] [13] . Indeed, SGs are involved in various stress-induced signaling cascades such as inflammatory signaling and stress-induced apoptotic signaling [14, 15] . Once the stress factor passes, SGs disassemble and the sorted mRNAs are released for active translation. It has been well established that SGs are present in a direct physical interaction with another type of RNA granules known as the processing (P) body (PBs) [16, 17] , where both granules have been found to play a role in stress-induced translational arrest. SGs are formed as a consequence of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by one of the selective stress-activated kinases (HRI, PKR, PERK, or GCN2) [18] [19] [20] , which in-turn inhibits translation initiation by reducing the availability of eIF2-GTP-tRNA i Met ternary complex. However, this is not the only mechanism by which SGs are assembled. Other studies showed phospho-eIF2\u03b1 independent mechanisms that induce translation inhibition and SG formation. For instance, an anti-inflammatory lipid mediator (15d-PGJ2) as well as xenobiotic agents pateamine A and hippuristanol have been identified as potent inhibitors of eukaryotic translation that powerfully induce SG formation via the interaction with eIF4A [21] [22] [23] . Moreover, other studies have reported that selective types of tiRNA, small fragments of tRNA, inhibit translation and induce SG formation by stressinduced disassembly of eIF4F [24] [25] [26] . The dynamic nature of these granules and their ability to selectively store and release specific mRNPs indicate their potential role in regulating gene expression, cell survival, and cell reprogramming. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have the unique capacity to self renew and differentiate into various types of cells [27] [28] [29] [30] . The ability of PSCs to direct their fate to either self-renewal or differentiation is balanced by different extra-and intra-cellular factors. One of the factors that have been found to primarily control this phenomenon is the alteration in micro-environmental conditions [31] . For instance, at early stages of embryonic development, ESCs reside in a hypoxic environment, where the cells produce very low amounts of ATP, whereas during cell differentiation ATP production increases through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which in-turn generated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) such as O 2 and H 2 O 2 [32] . High levels of ROS subject the cells to oxidative stress, which forces the cell to posseses certain abilities to combat stress conditions. Furthermore, stress-signaling pathways were found to play a role in ESC differentiation process [33] . In addition, the forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor, which plays an critical role in regulating stress response [34] , was also found to be an impor- ",

To ensure that these conditions did not affect the stem cell colony morphology, which is the visual characteristic of stem cell pluripotency, we tested the shape and size of non-treated and treated hiPSCs colonies using phase contrast microscopy. Typical pluripotent stem cell colony morphology was observed in non-treated as well as treated cells (S2 Fig) .

            "text": "One of the well-known upstream events that is associated with SG formation induced by SA, HS [42] , and H 2 O 2 [5] is the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (peIF2\u03b1). In the case of SA and HS treatments, the assembly of SGs is dependent on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, whereas the induction of these granules is peIF2\u03b1-independent in cells treated with H 2 O 2 . Therefore, it was of interest to test if this phenomenon also occurs in stressed hiPSCs. Using immuno-blot analysis, we analyzed the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in cells treated with SA (125\u03bcM), HS (42\u02daC), or H 2 O 2 (250\u03bcM). No eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was detected in non-treated cells or cells incubated Table 1 . Primers used in this study. at 37 o C (Fig 2A and 2B) . Notably, in cells treated with H 2 O 2 , which did not induce SG formation (Fig 1A) , the levels of peIF2\u03b1 were comparable to those of non-treated cells (Fig 2B) , demonstrating that H 2 O 2 is incapable of inducing either phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 or SGs in hiPSCs. In contrast, and consistent with our SG data (Fig 1) , both SA and HS that induce SG formation in hiPSCs, significantly induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig 2A and 2B) . These data indicate that stressors such as SA and HS that induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation result in the formation of SGs in hiPSCs. It has been previously reported that SG formation differs depending on the cell and nature of stress [43] . To determine whether SGs formed in hiPSCs have the same molecular signature as canonical SGs, the components of SGs were analyzed using a subset of known SG markers, TIAR, eIF4E, eIF4A ( Fig 2C) ; eIF3B, eIF4G, and PABP ( Fig 2D) . As expected in non-treated cells or cells incubated at 37\u02daC, all SG protein markers were normally distributed within the cytoplasm or the nucleus (Fig 2C and 2D ). In contrast, in hiPSCs treated with SA or subjected to HS, these markers were recruited to SGs (Fig 2C and 2D ; white arrows). All these proteins showed similar levels of recruitment with both stressors as indicated by fluorescence signal intensity (Fig 2, SA and 42\u02daC; enlarged boxes) . These results indicate that the formation of SGs in hiPSCs subjected to SA and HS exhibit similar characteristics to those of canonical SGs. ",

To determine whether different stresses regulate pluripotent proteins expression in hiPSCs, total RNA was extracted from non-treated cells or cells subjected to SA, H 2 O 2 or HS, and a qualitative RNA analysis of six endogenous pluripotent protein markers, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, L1TD1, and LIN28A, was performed using RT-PCR. As shown in Fig 4A, cells subjected to any of the three stressors expressed pluripotent genes in levels comparable to non-treated cells. To confirm these results the pluripotent proteins extracted from treated or non-treated cell lysates were assessed by immuno-blot analyses. The expression levels of each protein were quantified using a densitometer and normalized to the levels of non-treated cells. Interestingly, in contrast to pluripotent protein gene expression levels, SA and HS selectively down-regulate the expression of pluripotent protein markers (Fig 4B and 4C ). In SA treated cells, NANOG and L1TD1 are the only pluripotent protein markers that were significantly decreased compared to nontreated cells, whereas in cells subjected to 42\u02daC, the expression of all other pluripotent protein markers was significantly decreased (Fig 4B and 4C) . Conversely, H 2 O 2 , which did not induce SGs and has no effect on pluripotent gene expression, also failed to alter the expression levels of the pluripotent protein markers tested except for SOX2, which was found to be down-regulated (Fig 4B and 4C) . These data classify SA and HS as SG inducers that selectively down-regulate pluripotent protein expression under stress conditions.",

It is known that RBPs are the main proteins that are recruited to SGs [47] , therefore the first step was to analyze pluripotent protein markers for the presence of RNA binding domains (RBD). Based on published data, we selected 36 proteins that are known to be the most common and well known human pluripotent markers [48] and screened them to identify possible RBD (Table 2) using the RNA-Binding Protein DataBase (RBPD) http://rbpdb.ccbr.utoronto.ca/ [49] . Of these, we identified only three proteins, LIN28A, L1TD1, and DPPA5, which harbor RBD. LIN28A and L1TD1, which have previously been shown to co-localize in SGs [38], contain the CCCH zinc finger (ZF) RBD and RNA Recognition motif (RRM) domain, respectively, whereas the K homology (KH) domain is recognized as the RBD of DPPA5 (Table 2) .",

Since we did not identify SOX2, NANOG, or KLF4 as RBPs, we stained them as negative RBP controls. As expected pluripotent protein markers that have no RBD were not recruited to SGs (S3 Fig). However, the three pluripotent RBPs (LIN28A, L1TD1, and DPPA5) co-localized with the SG marker, G3BP, in hiPSCs treated with SA or subjected to HS (Fig 5A-5C ). Interestingly, in non-treated cells, L1TD1 appears as aggregates, which differ in shape and size to \"standard\" SGs ( Fig 5A; No treat and 37\u02daC; yellow arrows). Some of these aggregates, co-localize with G3BP SGs (white arrows), whereas others do not (Fig 5A; SA and 42\u02daC ). In contrast, LIN28A is highly recruited to SGs (Fig 5B, white arrows) , as shown by its strong colocalization with G3BP (Fig 5B, yellow color) . Staining stressed hiPSCs for DPPA5 demonstrates that the protein is weakly co-localized with G3BP in SGs (Fig 5C) . These data confirm that pluripotent protein markers LIN28A and L1TD1 are part of hiPSC SGs formed as a result of SA or HS treatment and introduce DPPA5 as a novel component of SGs.",

SG formation is a very well recognized stress response phenomenon that is observed in cells subjected to different forms of environmental insult [12, 43, 47] . This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of mammalian cells [12, 43] , as well as yeast [50] [51] [52] and Drosphila cells [53] [54] [55] indicating that the assembly of these granules is evolutionary conserved amongst different species and hence plays a significant role in cell stress response. Despite being a common cell response, the formation and the composition of these granules differs among species, between cell types, and according to the stress types and impact. In Drosophila, granules formed in response to both HS and SA treatments resemble those formed in mammalian cells [53] . However, the composition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae granules formed after glucose deprivation lacks two major SGs components, eIF3 and 40S ribosomal subunits, but contain eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4E, eIF4G and Pab1p and thus called EGP bodies [56] . Interestingly, this was not the case when the same cells were treated with 1,6-hexanediol, [52] or subjected to HS [57] , which remarkably induce canonical SGs.",

            "text": "It has been postulated that ESCs have higher tolerance to stress than differentiated cells, indicating that ESCs are equipped with various mechanisms to protect them from adverse environmental conditions [58] . The formation of SGs in stressed PSCs may be one of these protective mechanisms during development. This assumption is supported by the fact that SGs Stress granule formation in hiPSCs are able to selectively sequester and protect mRNA from degradation, which will eventually be required for ESC development [59] . The availability of maternally contributed mRNAs is a crucial step during embryonic development, because it initiates embryogenesis [60] . Moreover, the SG forming protein, TIAR, has been found to be essential in protecting C. elegans germ cells and embryos from HS insult [61] . Our data supported the proposition that SGs are a protection center for PSCs, where the pluripotent protein markers, LIN28A, L1TD1, and DPPA5 are sequestered to those granules during stress conditions, however, after recovery, SGs were completely disassembled. This data is consistent with others that show the recruitment of LIN28A and L1TD1 to SGs in stressed ESCs [38] and iPSCs [39] . The absence of other PPMs from SGs does not exclude the possibility that the RNA encoding those proteins may be the ones recruited to SGs. Our data illustrates that pluripotent gene expression is not altered after stress treatment, whereas the expression of some PPMs, such as NANOG, is significantly down-regulated, indicating that the mRNA encoding these proteins is either degraded or sequestered to SGs. In support of this hypothesis, Tan et al. [62] reported that NANOG mRNA harbors a full consensus AU-rich (ARE) element (AUUUAAUUUA) in its 3' UTR and binds to Poly-(rC) Binding Protein 1, which was documented to be recruited to SGs and PBs [63] . Interestingly, ARE elements containing mRNAs were found to be highly recruited to SGs [47] . Importantly, TIAR, one of the main limiting factors of SG formation, specifically binds to this canonical AUUUA motif located at 3'UTR ARE elements of mRNAs [64] . Therefore, it is logical to assume that TIAR binds to NANOG mRNA and/or other ARE PPMs and sequesters it to SGs. Further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

This could be due to the high expression of glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs), antioxidant enzymes that detoxify H 2 O 2 and protect PSCs from oxidative damage [65] . Indeed, undifferentiated iPSCs showed elevated levels of glutathione and significant up-regulation of several H 2 O 2 scavengers including Gpx2 and GSTA2 as compared to differentiated cells [66] . In support to this notion, during the differentiation of mouse and hESCs, Gpx2 expression was down-regulated, indicating the important role of Gpx2 in maintaining the pluripotent status of stem cells [58] . Moreover, several studies demonstrated that undifferentiated hESCs show higher resistance to H 2 O 2 as compared to differentiated cells [67] [68] [69] . Consistently, our results showed that H 2 O 2 induces SGs in HUVEC (S1 Fig) and U2OS cells [5] but not hiPSCs. Therefore, it is conceivable that PSCs possess sufficient resistance against H 2 O 2 insult to maintain the cells in its pluripotent status for a certain period of time without the need to induce SG formation.",

Indeed, FoxO1 and another member of the forkhead family, FoxD1, have been identified as mediators in reprogramming somatic cells to iPSCs [36]. Importantly the RBPs LIN28A [37-39] and LINE-1 type transposase domain containing 1 (L1TD1) [38], pluripotent protein markers for undifferentiated PSCs, were sequestered to SGs and PBs in hESCs. Moreover, other components of the ESC regulatory network, RELB [39] and Makarin1 (MKRN1) [40], are found to be component of SGs. Although, all the previously mentioned studies highlight the important role of stress in regulating pluripotency, there are still several questions that need to be addressed to elevate our knowledge of how PSCs regulate stress response programs to respond to different types of stressors.In this study, we investigated the effect of two different types of stressors: oxidative stress (sodium arsenite (SA) and H 2 O 2 ), and thermal stress (HS) on SG formation in human (h) iPSCs. Our results demonstrated that only SA and HS induce SG formation and selectively down-regulate pluripotent protein marker expression in hiPSCs. Screening for pluripotent proteins recruited to SGs confirms that LIN28A and L1TD1 are SG markers and identified DPPA5 as a new, but weakly recruited SG component. Altogether, our data demonstrate that not all stressors are capable of inducing SGs in hiPSCs, and the granules formed in stressed hiPSCs are typical SGs.",
