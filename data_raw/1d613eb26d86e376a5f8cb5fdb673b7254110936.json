The input dataset consists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a single index case. We split the input dataset into two successive subsets, to evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend significantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously studied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning the effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995-2002. Our analyses showed that the 1995-2002 dataset should be divided into two separate subsets for the periods 1995-1998 and 1999-2002. In contrast, Jansen et al. take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al. In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world data. The methodology may be used for updating R in real time, as surveillance outbreak data become available.",

In the case of infectious diseases, it is customary to measure how far an epidemic is from eradication by calculating yet another epidemiological parameter, the basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 (e.g., [3] , pp. [4] [5] . By definition, R 0 represents the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. If R 0 is larger than 1, then an outbreak becomes an epidemic; otherwise, it goes extinct. If the population is not fully susceptible, then one calculates the effective reproduction number, denoted by R [4, 5] . However, neither R 0 nor R is regularly monitored by public-health authorities (e.g., [6] , pp. 39-65).",

In addition, R 0 may depend on factors pertaining to host sociology, such as population density and social awareness about epidemics. All these factors may change with time. Changes in R 0 may signal that the pathogen has become more transmissible, virulent or persistent in the population. They may also signal societal re-organization in response to the epidemic dynamic. Particularly important are changes in R, which, in addition to changes in R 0 , may also reflect changes in the susceptibility of the population. Monitoring changes in R may thus be instrumental in determining the success of public-health interventions such as mass vaccination [4, 7, 8] .",

Surveillance and contact tracing provides a means of monitoring outbreaks by permanent registration of new cases. For example, monkeypox [12] and non-zoonotic measles [4] are potential candidates for eradication through vaccination. Monkeypox remains worrisome for the possibility that repeated introductions in the human population may yield novel strains of human poxes [13] . Following vaccine licensing in 1963, measles incidence in the United States decreased by more than 95% [14] . Nevertheless, recent R analysis [8] shows the potential for measles to re-emerge and emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance. In this work, we discuss monitoring R using outbreak-size surveillance data; only minor modifications are needed to apply our methodology to monitoring R 0 of emerging infectious diseases.",

These data may result from close surveillance of emerging or re-emerging infections. However, outbreaks may be clustered in time and space and difficult to tell apart.

It is no coincidence that (global) maximization problems are divided between one-and multi-dimensional, the first class of problems being significantly easier.
