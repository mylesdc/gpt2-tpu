All viruses replicate by invading living cells, where they compete with host genes for the machinery and building blocks of life. In the process of copying itself, the virus often destroys the host cell, which can lead to disease. Viruses replicate exclusively within host cells, and onward transmission requires viral release. This is primarily achieved through two alternative mechanisms: lysis, where an infected cell dies and burst opens, so that all virions exit at once; or budding, where virions emerge gradually from a still living cell by appropriating part of the cell membrane, known as a viral envelope. Enveloped viruses cause diseases such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, AIDS, H1N1 influenza, SARS and Lassa fever.",

            "text": "In eukaryotes, intracellular vesicle transport is mediated by vesicle transport proteins that are needed to move cargo between organelles and across the plasma membrane [4, 5] . Four mechanisms have been proposed to explain how highly curved membranes and vesicles are formed. In the first, the membrane wraps around intrinsically curved proteins that have a high affinity for the membrane such as BAR (BIN/ Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains [6] and dynamin [7] . In the second mechanism, locally high concentrations of lipid-binding protein can drive curvature by a crowding mechanism [8] , although it is not clear how readily the necessary protein concentrations can be achieved in living cells. In the third mechanism, steric effects between proteins that occupy more space on one side of the membrane than the other could change the shape of the membrane [9] . In the fourth mechanism, bending is triggered by a conformational change, causing part of a protein to be inserted like a wedge in the membrane, stretching one side of the membrane more than the other and causing the membrane to curve in response. Examples of proteins that are believed to work in this manner include Sar1p [10] , Epsins [11] , ADP-ribosylation factors [11] , which drive vesicle budding towards the cytoplasm, and the influenza virus M2 protein [12] , which helps to cut new virus particles free of the cell.",

Table 1 summarizes what is currently known about the minimal requirements for formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) of enveloped viruses. VLP formation requires both budding and scission.

Although structurally distinct from other virus matrix proteins [51] [52] [53] , arenavirus Z and other matrix proteins have been reported to bind the membrane deeply enough to displace an estimated 5-10% of lipid molecules from the inner membrane face of fully assembled virus particles [45] .

For the sake of simplicity, proteins are assumed to cover an axisymmetric region on a spherical cell. This assumption is supported by electron micrographs that show that Z forms a layer along the underside of the viral membrane in round virions (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ). While Z can be difficult to see on individual images (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 upper panels), it becomes clearly visible when hundreds of virion images of a similar size are averaged (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 lower panels). The use of a mathematical model allows us to also investigate the potential for interactions between the proteins to stabilize the growing bulge by making the membrane rigid, effectively locking the curvature in place. Although rigidity has not been specifically demonstrated for arenaviruses, it is known in icosahedrally ordered enveloped viruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses [54] [55] [56] , and can be inferred for some non-icosahedral viruses from the architecture of empty filamentous influenza virus capsids and immature coronaviruses [57] . Previous observations of enveloped viruses [12] show that virions form from growing bulges that eventually form spheres attached to the membrane by a narrow tube. Cellular endosomal sorting proteins have been implicated in the abscission stage of arenavirus budding [41] , and are assumed here to finish the budding process by severing the connection between the virion and the cell.",

Hypothetical anchor, switch and activator model of virus budding explored in this study. Arenavirus Z is shown embedded in a lipid bilayer by means of a covalently attached myristate anchor (wavy line) at the N terminus, followed by an amphipathic switch (shaded cylinder) and a C-terminal activator (white oval with tail) that has a potential activator-activator interaction site (black oval). Immediately after translation (1), the hydrophobic side of the switch is inserted in the membrane awaiting the arrival of the virus cargo. In the context of a viral protein assembly (2) -(4), a simultaneous force applied to all the activators in the assembly exposes multiple switches, allowing the hydrophobic faces of the switches to come together in the cytosol.

Our numerical solutions reveal the quasi-steady evolution of the membrane shape as the budding area A p (that part of the membrane to which viral protein is attached) grows with time. For small values of A p , a mound forms on the cell surface. This becomes a distinct bud shape as this region increases, and eventually forms a spherical virion attached to the cell by a thin 'neck'. For dynamic evolution, see the electronic supplementary material, video S4. These forms are comparable with real-life observations (figure 1), although the continuum model does not extend to the limit where the bud pinches off (see \u00a74 for details). We further confirm that such behaviour is possible within realistic biological parameter ranges. As well as the change in curvature in the budding region, our model has three key parameters: the non-dimensional size a of the budding area; the relative change in stiffness b in the budding area; and the farfield tension T 0 in the cell membrane (which is related to the transmembrane pressure difference p). Solving the model across a range of parameter values, including those presented in table 3, indicates that bud development occurs in the biologically relevant regime: figure 4 shows the numerical solution of the system as the area of viral-protein-attached membrane (the budding region) increases.

It follows from equations (4.45) and (4.46) that, if T 0 is negligibly small, b needs to be unjustifiable large to have a noticeable impact on the system. Increased stiffness of the budding region (b . 1) can produce a tighter bud with a smaller radius, thus increasing the potential to pinch off for smaller budding regions. Electronic supplementary material, figure S5 shows numerical solutions for the case where the transmembrane pressure p is of the order of 1 N m 22 , and the area of the budding region is 4pr 2 (the surface area of a sphere of radius r), as the bending stiffness of the membrane in the budding region increases. When sufficient protein is present, a bud can be closed under any farfield tension T 0 , provided b is sufficiently large (as b ! 1 the budding region membrane is forced into a sphere with radius r), although this is unlikely to be biologically realistic.

Although simulations here focus on spherical buds, the membrane model is compatible with the emergence of other (e.g. filamental) shaped virus particles budding from the membrane.

In an isotonic state, the osmotic pressure on the cell balances, rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J R Soc Interface 10: 20130403 and the pressure difference is zero by definition. At other times, cells may experience negative pressure in a hypertonic solution (and even undergo pasmosis), or become turgid as a result of a hypotonic solution or cell movement. The latter may result from the formation of a pseudopodium, which can require a significant pressure differential [72] (see also [73] ). Although pressure differences of the order of 10 N m 22 [73] to 10 2 N m 22 [72] have been recorded, in healthy mammals regulation (by, for example, antidiuretic hormone from the kidneys) ensures that any osmotic imbalance is corrected over a much shorter timescale than that taken for vesicles to form (of the order of minutes). Although it is therefore expected that the pressure differential will be low for much of the time, with cells seeking to be flaccid, this is not assumed to be true in what follows: the only prerequisite on p in the model is that it be not too large, in the sense p ( B 0 =r 3 , which is satisfied by pressures with magnitudes below O(10) N m 22 (table 3) .",

The organization of pre-budding patches closely resembles that of budded virions in cross section, as shown in figure 1 . The patches then appear to bend the effectively planar membrane into a virus-sized sphere, which then pinches off from the plasma membrane to form a new virion. Because Z can drive the budding process independently, this suggests that Z has membrane bending and possibly also membrane rigidifying properties. In our proposed model, it is assumed that membrane curvature is induced by an asymmetric change in the amount of space the GP and Z proteins occupy in the two membrane leaflets. Several cellular [5, 10] and viral [12] proteins have been proposed to induce membrane curvature by inserting amphipathic protein domains into one face of the membrane.",

There is no area enclosed between this point and the axis (A \u00bc 0). By symmetry, we must have Q \u00bc 0, and we take z \u00bc 0 to set the origin of the vertical coordinate.

The membrane is horizontal, but is upside down relative to it orientation at the top (f \u00bc p).The area between this point and s \u00bc 0 is the full area of the cell membrane, which is fixed and set equal to that of a spherical cell of radius r c \u00f0A \u00bc 4pr 2 c \u00de.

(The vertical location of the bottom of the cell is obtained as part of the solution.)Although there are nine boundary conditions, it is not the case that the seventh-order system is over-determined. The system has a conserved quantity whose value is consistent with both sets of boundary conditions and one free parameter s max . The conserved quantity arises from a vertical force balance, and is given by\u00f04:27\u00deThe equations imply dF/ds \u00bc 0, and the boundary conditions at s \u00bc 0 determine F \u00bc 0.
