A randomised trial (RCT) conducted in the 1970s at a British boarding school found higher influenza incidence among students who had received multiple previous vaccines than among those who received only the current season's vaccine [5] . Results from a larger RCT among adults in the 1980s did not lead to the same conclusion [6] . Based on the antigenic distance hypothesis put forth by Smith et al., negative or positive interference can result from prior season vaccination depending on differences in the antigenic distances between prior and current vaccine strains and the current epidemic strain [7] . Most studies to date incorporated only a single previous season when examining the impact of repeated vaccination [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

Third, since Ontario residents may receive influenza vaccines in settings besides physician offices and pharmacies (leading to incorrectly classifying individuals vaccinated outside of these settings as unvaccinated), for each of the above analyses we conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis using a publicly available macro [21] to correct for misclassification of influenza vaccination status using previously reported parameters for sensitivity (69%) and specificity (90%) of influenza vaccination codes for older adults in Ontario health administrative databases [22] . This macro performs multiple iterations of exposure re-classification for each execution. For each iteration, sensitivity and specificity values within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the previously reported parameters are selected. Using these values and the observed counts of exposed cases and controls, expected counts are determined to calculate a positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for cases and controls separately.

For example, we compared patients who had received 9-10 previous vaccinations and who were vaccinated in the current season to those who had received 9-10 previous vaccinations but who were not vaccinated in the current season. The rationale for this approach is that it quantifies the incremental benefit of vaccination in the current season, and acknowledges that since a patient cannot change his/her past vaccination status, comparing to those not vaccinated in the current nor any past season may not be appropriate. Ultimately, this provides more patient-centred results as it aligns with the decision that needs to be made by patients each season regarding the benefit of receiving the current season's vaccine.",

Notably, for similar levels of vaccination in previous seasons, receipt of current season vaccination was associated with higher VE estimates than being unvaccinated in the current season. VE decreased for current vaccine recipients as the number of previous vaccinations received increased (i.e. 36% vs 31% vs 26%) (trend test p = 0.007). In contrast, for those not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection increased as the number of previous vaccinations received increased (i.e. 13% vs 17%) (p < 0.001).

When we examined the impact of repeated vaccination during previous influenza seasons on VE for the current season, we observed a declining trend in VE as the number of previous vaccinations increased. Nevertheless, influenza vaccination during the current season was associated with some protection against influenza infection irrespective of the number of vaccinations over the previous 10 seasons, except for individuals vaccinated 9-10 times before we corrected for misclassification of vaccination status. After correcting for misclassification of vaccination status in the current season, influenza vaccination was associated with some protection even for those vaccinated 9-10 times during the previous 10 seasons. Reassuringly, the overall observed trends in VE were consistent when correcting for this misclassification, both for the current season only and when manually reclassifying vaccination status during past seasons based on current season misclassification. Similar patterns as any influenza were observed against A(H3N2) but not A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B, but interpretation of these results is challenging due to lower case counts for the latter analyses leading to less precision. The observed patterns for any influenza were likely driven by A(H3N2) since that subtype comprised 67% of specimens during the influenza seasons included in this study, if one assumes the subtype distribution for unsubtyped specimens is the same as for subtyped specimens. We noted that for patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection appeared to increase with increasing numbers of vaccines received during previous seasons. We also demonstrated that being vaccinated in the current season resulted in consistently greater protection, compared with not being vaccinated in the current season, regardless of the number of previous vaccinations.",

            "text": "While reduced VE from repeated vaccination has been reported previously [13, 25] , this has not been consistently found [11, 12] . The antigenic distance hypothesis is one potential explanation for reduced VE; if the vaccine strains for the current season and prior season are similar but the current season's vaccine strain is distinct from the current epidemic strain, negative interference leading to reduced VE for the current season may result [7] . However, this hypothesis does not consider the effects of multiple previous vaccine or virus exposures [25] . Thompson [17] while the other did not [18] . However, similar to our results, both studies showed that vaccination in the current season provided some protection against influenza regardless of the number of previous vaccinations. No study has ever examined the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons. The residual protection from being vaccinated in previous seasons observed in our study has also been seen elsewhere; this phenomenon may result from cross-reactivity of immune responses elicited by previous vaccinations with current-season virus antigens [17] . It is possible that due to this potential residual protection, the incremental benefit of current season vaccination may be difficult to observe for those who have received many previous vaccinations.",

Individuals may be more inclined to be vaccinated for the first time if they were infected by influenza in the prior season. Vaccine responses may be enhanced with recent prior infection [27] , such that those who were vaccinated repeatedly may appear to have lower VE. However, measuring immunity arising from previous infection is challenging [11] . In addition, while pooling of multiple seasons can increase statistical power, it can mask important variation at the individual season level [14] . Thus, a large knowledge gap persists regarding the immunologic mechanisms for potential vaccine interference. Future studies that longitudinally ascertain both influenza vaccination and influenza infection status over multiple seasons would be helpful to better understand the impact of repeated vaccination on current season VE as well as residual protection from previous vaccination.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the specimens were not collected through systematic screening and enrollment but rather as part of routine clinical care. However, we have validated the use of these specimens for estimating VE [19] . Second, while test-negative studies typically use symptom onset date as the index date, we were limited to using specimen collection date. This may have led to underestimation of VE. Third, the VE estimate against unsubtyped influenza A was outside of the range between those against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), raising the possibility of potential bias. Although only 49% of individuals positive for influenza A had their specimens subtyped, they are fairly representative of all individuals positive for influenza A (Supplementary Table S1 ). We speculate that the lower VE observed for unsubtyped specimens may be due to a greater proportion being collected during the 2014/15 season (a season with known poor match) and during later months of influenza season (with potentially lower VE due to intra-season waning of immunity). Fourth, receipt of influenza vaccines outside of physician offices and pharmacies leads to misclassification of vaccination status when relying on health administrative data to ascertain vaccination status. However, healthcare-seeking behaviour has been found to be similar between test-positive and test-negative individuals [28] , so any misclassification would likely be non-differential and underestimate VE, as demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses. The low sensitivity value for the influenza vaccination billing claims used in these sensitivity analyses may have resulted from bias given the self-reported nature of the reference standard available for validation of the claims data, or because pharmacist billing claims data were not yet available for inclusion in the validation study [22] . Fifth, the macro programme used for our sensitivity analysis could not include interaction terms with the main exposure to determine whether subgroup similarities/differences in VE were maintained after misclassification was corrected, and could only correct for misclassification of current season vaccination status and not misclassification in past seasons. However, our sensitivity analyses involving reclassification of past vaccination based on misclassification of current season vaccination status found very similar trends as when accounting only for current season misclassification. Sixth, we used the same values of sensitivity and specificity of the vaccination billing claims for all strata of past vaccination history because we did not have stratum-specific parameters. The observed trend might not remain if the magnitude of the bias correction varies by past vaccination history. Seventh, our use of meta-regression to assess for trends in VE estimates between vaccination history strata does not capture season-to-season heterogeneity in terms of circulating viruses, vaccine match, and host-virus immunological interactions. Eighth, we did not have information on participants' influenza infections in the previous seasons, as most infections do not result in laboratory testing. Ninth, we did not have information on vaccination history for > 10 previous influenza seasons; the impact of repeated vaccination over longer periods of time remain unknown. Finally, as an observational study, the possibility of residual confounding remains.",
