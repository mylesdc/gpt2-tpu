            "text": "Synonymous codon usage bias (CUB) is a defined as the non-random usage of codons encoding the same amino acid across different genomes. This phenomenon is common to all organisms and the real weight of the many factors involved in its shaping still remains to be fully determined. So far, relatively little attention has been put in the analysis of CUB in bivalve mollusks due to the limited genomic data available. Taking advantage of the massive sequence data generated from next generation sequencing projects, we explored codon preferences in 64 different species pertaining to the six major evolutionary lineages in Bivalvia. We detected remarkable differences across species, which are only partially dependent on phylogeny. While the intensity of CUB is mild in most organisms, a heterogeneous group of species (including Arcida and Mytilida, among the others) display higher bias and a strong preference for AT-ending codons. We show that the relative strength and direction of mutational bias, selection for translational efficiency and for translational accuracy contribute to the establishment of synonymous codon usage in bivalves. Although many aspects underlying bivalve CUB still remain obscure, we provide for the first time an overview of this phenomenon in this large, commercially and environmentally important, class of marine invertebrates. Fields et al., 2014). Details about the data used for the different species are provided in Table S1 .",

This was achieved by performing reciprocal tBLASTx searches (the e-value threshold was set a 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 and only hits displaying sequence identity >50% were considered). This procedure resulted in a selection of 2,846 conserved protein-coding genes, whose orthologous sequences were retrieved in the remaining 60 species. Due to the heterogeneous tissue and developmental stage origin, the different sequencing platforms and depth applied, several of these evolutionarily conserved sequences could not be identified or were fragmented in some transcriptomes. In order to ensure a minimum quality criteria, all the selected species had to display at least 25% of the sequences included in the dataset of evolutionarily conserved genes, with an average length >500 nucleotides.",

Different species clearly show a different tendency to the preferential usage of specific codons, as exemplified by the average Effective Number of Codons (ENC) (Wright, 1990) values in Table 1 . Overall, the observed ENC values range between 40.65 (in the Chinese surf clam M. chinensis) and 56.80 (G. turtoni) across the analyzed species, while the theoretical value is comprised between 21 (if only a single codon is used for each amino acid) and 61 (if all codons are used with equal frequency). Most bivalve species display a weak CUB, using on average over 50 out of the 61 available codons, and only a limited number of bivalve species display an ENC value comparable to that of other invertebrates (the ENC range is 45-48 in Drosophila and nematodes) Mitreva et al., 2006; Vicario, Moriyama & Powell, 2007) .",

This measure is a variation of ENC (Wright, 1990) which is scaled in a range from 0 to 1 for each amino acid independently from the level of redundancy, and which can be used to estimate the relative intensity of CUB across the 18 degenerate amino acids . As reported in Table S5 and Fig. 4 , the sENC-x values of all amino acids negatively correlate with ENC with significant p-values, including those with relatively low average s-ENCx values. The only exception is represented by Gln, which is likely related to the fact that it is the only two-fold degenerate amino acid to display a strong preference for a G/C-ending (CAG) over an A/T-ending codon (CAA) (see Fig. 3A ). Overall, Arg is certainly the amino acid which accounts for the greatest CUB in bivalves, as highlighted by the high average s-ENCx value (0.32), followed by Pro, Thr, Cys, Ala, Gly, Ser and Leu, all characterized by values >0.1.",

A critical parameter tightly linked to mutational bias is genomic GC content, which in turn strongly influences the coding GC content (Knight, Freeland & Landweber, 2001) and GC 3 (Mitreva et al., 2006) . Actually, all amino acids, with the exception of the non-degenerate methionine and tryptophan, tolerate A/T to C/G changes in the third codon position and thus, in organisms where mutational bias is dominant over other factors, the occurrence of G/C-ending codons should follow the total genomic GC content. However, even in such cases some deviations are observed, in particular for the 6-fold degenerated Arg and Leu, which also tolerate synonymous mutations at the first codon position (Palidwor, Perkins & Xia, 2010) .",

Overall, while GC 3 can assume values as low as \u223c23 in M. chinensis, GC 3 and AT 3 contents become even in species displaying weak CUB (and high ENC). Based on these observations and the well-documented correlation between genomic GC content and coding GC 3 , one could hypothesize that the bivalves pertaining to the clustering group II possess a similar genomic GC content, lower than all the bivalve species included in the heterogeneous clustering group I, thus explaining their common placement in a well-distinct cluster regardless of the reported phylogenetic distance (Fig. 2) . On the contrary, the bivalve transcriptomes of the clustering group Ia show a GC 3 not far from 50%, accompanied by ENC values higher than 54 (Fig. 5) , which would suggest that the absence of a strong CUB is linked to a lack of mutational bias.",

We observed a significant positive correlation between CUB (negative ENC) and gene expression in the three tissues analyzed, as well as between CUB and ORF (protein) length (Table 2) , which would suggest that both selection for translational speed and accuracy are actively shaping codon usage in oyster. However, we also observed a highly significant, negative correlation between GC 3 and gene expression and between GC 3 and protein length, which seem to contradict the mutational bias given by the A/T-rich nature of the oyster genome. This observation matches the results obtained in a previous work conducted with limited expression data based on Sanger EST sequencing, which suggested that translational selection acts as a contrasting force to mutational bias in oyster, effectively counteracting its action in highly expressed genes (Sauvage et al., 2007) . Our data further indicate that, besides the selection for translational speed, also the selection for translational accuracy provides a contribution to the selection of G/C-ending codons in oyster. The contrasting action of mutational bias and selection becomes particularly evident while taking into consideration the correlation between CAI, a directional measure of CUB which is based on a reference set of highly expressed genes (Sharp & Li, 1987) , and ENC, which on the other hand is a non-directional measure which does not permit to appreciate the contribution of opposite forces (in this case mutational bias towards A/T-ending codons and selection towards G/C-ending codons). Indeed, in oyster and in all the other species clusterized in group I (see Fig. 2 ), the scatter in the correlation plot between CAI and ENC appears to be quite relevant ( Fig. 6 ; Paerson correlation coefficients are \u22120.44 for C. gigas and \u22120.38 for P. magellanicus). This indicates that the mutational bias towards A/T is counterbalanced by natural selection in favor of G/C-ending codons in a relevant number of genes. However, the significant correlation between ENC and GC 3 at the whole protein-coding transcriptome level (Paerson correlation = 0.16, p-value = 5.42 \u00d7 10 \u2212148 ) indicates that the weight of A/T mutational bias is still dominating over that of G/C selection in most oyster genes.",

To better interpret this result, we extended the analysis performed in oyster to a representative species of this group, M. galloprovincialis, limiting our calculations to full-length protein-coding transcripts (Table 2) . Overall, like in oyster, the significant positive correlation between gene expression and GC 3 over three different tissues indicates that selection for translational speed acts towards G/C-ending codons. However, unlike oyster, this appears to have no effect on CUB on the whole transcriptome scale, as the correlation between gene expression and ENC was not significant. In addition, we observed that, in contrast with oyster, the selection for translational accuracy is biased towards A/T-ending codons (i.e., GC 3 and protein length are negatively correlated). Overall, the M. galloprovincialis average GC 3 is 30.80%, a value which is very close to the GC genomic content, further indicating that mutational bias and selection for translational accuracy, which both act in favor of A/T-ending codons, are largely dominating over the opposite selection for translational speed in mussel.",

We show that bivalves can be divided into two distinct groups, based on the intensity of the bias towards the use of optimal codons.

However, based on the data collected so far, the different intensity of the opposing forces represented by mutational bias towards A/T-ending codons and by selection for translational speed towards G/C-ending codons appear to be two major players in this process. Further study will be certainly needed to ascertain whether this model can be extended to all bivalve species once additional genomic resources will become available. Such analyses could also benefit from the integration of additional data such as the abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs and data concerning effective population size of each species. This large scale analysis supports the progressive understanding of molecular genome evolution in bivalves and it is potentially useful for many different applications. For example, as we have previously explained, codon usage is known to widely vary across genes based on their expression level. The calculation of CAI could be used to predict the expression level and the transcriptional efficiency of unknown genes and to assess the adaptation of viral genes to their bivalve hosts (Sharp & Li, 1987) . Codon bias also has profound implications on codon-based phylogenetic reconstructions, which could be optimized to avoid the over-estimation of divergence between distantly related species and the under-estimation of divergence between closely related ones (Christianson, 2005) .",

As the raw genomic sequences of new organisms become available, new tools are required to efficiently identify genes and to predict their structure and boundaries, in particular in non-model invertebrate species, which show a very high proportion of genes without similarity to sequences deposited in public databases. The oyster genome has already evidenced that homology-based annotation methods perform rather poorly for certain gene families, highlighting the need for integrating additional parameters in gene prediction algorithms to optimize annotation (Gerdol, Venier & Pallavicini, 2014) . A number of algorithms which take into account species-specific CUB information have been developed, trying to identify protein coding sequences based on their congruence with a reference codon usage table (Gribskov, Devereux & Burgess, 1984) . This task is particularly important and complicated in Bivalvia, since genomic analyses in this taxa are quickly expanding and only two species present a completely sequenced and annotated genome (Su\u00e1rez-Ulloa et al., 2013) .
