Formation and regulation mechanism of migration behavior has resulted in a large number of fundamental researches involving quantitative studies of gene expression in this species. Using appropriate reference gene is critical in RT-qPCR data normalization. A comprehensive study on the reference genes in M. separata is lacking. In this paper, expression stabilities of ten candidate reference genes were evaluated in M. separata under various biotic and abiotic conditions by employing four different software geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative \u0394CT method. The comprehensive stabilities ranking of these genes were suggested by RefFinder. PKG as a target gene was employed to justify the number of reference genes in four larval tissues and two photoperiod treatments. Results demonstrate that the first three most stable genes were as follows: EF, CypA, and -TUB for developmental stages; EF, CypA, and RPL12 for larval tissues; EF, TBP, and -TUB for adult tissues. RPL12, -TUB, and EF for densities; EF, RPL12, and GAPDH for photoperiod treatments;",

            "text": "The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an important agricultural pest in Asia and Australia [1] . In China, it is widely distributed except in the far northwest (Xinjiang). The larvae of the armyworm can inflict devastating damage to more than 104 species of plants in 16 families including food crops (wheat, rice, foxtail millet, and maize) [2] . Each year, the nocturnal moths engage in a seasonal long-distance migration between southern and northern China [3] . M. separata has been extensively studied as a model migratory species in China [3] [4] [5] . The research contents mainly involved environmental, physiological, hormonal, genetic, and molecular factors [3] . The fifth and sixth instars of the larvae (the gluttony period) are the very important stages in which larvae consume vast food to accumulate sufficient nutrition and energy to meet remaining development and migration requirements. Environmental factors such as temperature [6, 7] , photoperiod [8] , and larval density [9] [10] [11] can trigger or inhibit the onset of migration. Moths response to larval environmental conditions [12] and are most likely to take off on a migratory flight the first or second night after adult eclosion [13] . Therefore, molecular studies towards environmental factors and specific developmental stages are the focus of migration research in M. separata. Exploring target gene expression profiles in tissues from various environmental conditions or developmental periods will promote a greater understanding of the migration regulation mechanism. Reports on molecular regulation mechanisms of migration for M. separata were relatively scarce.",

To date, the reference genes of several insects have been identified and validated for RT-qPCR normalization among different biotic or abiotic conditions, e.g., Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) [22] , Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) [23] , Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae) [24] , Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae) [25] , Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [26] , Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [27] , Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [28] , Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [29] , Anastrepha obliqua (Diptera: Tephritidae) [30] , and Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) [31] .

The least stable genes determined by four programs were 18S, 28S, and -ACT. According to RefFinder, the stability ranking of the reference genes from the most stable to the least stable across different developmental stages is as follows: (Figure 2(a) ). The geNorm analysis showed that all pairwise variation values were above the proposed 0.15 cut-off value (Figure 3(a) ). The lowest pairwise variation was shown at V 6/7 (the variation between the normalization factors of six genes in relation to seven genes); thus, six genes are recommended as reference genes for normalization. It is relatively impractical to use excessive numbers of endogenous control genes for normalization. The use of the three most stable control genes was considered to be adequate for normalization of RT-qPCR [34, 38] . To verify this recommendation, the correlation of NF values between the three most stable genes and the optimal number of genes was calculated. As shown in Figure 3 (b)-(A), there is a good correlation between two NF measures (proposed number, three; the theoretical optimal number, six) for developmental stages (r = 0.972). This result supports that the three most stable internal control genes are sufficient for an accurate normalization of developmental stages data. Thus, the normalization with the combination EF, CypA, and RPL12 should be suggested by geNorm for a suitable normalization in the different developmental stages. And geNorm is basically in line with RefFinder identifying three out of ten most stable genes (Figure 2(a) ).",

Among four various larval tissues, the results of normalizing PKG expression were similar when, respectively, using EF or RPL12 (the most stable reference gene) and the combination EF and RPL12 (the most stable two) (Figure 4(a) ). However, the difference of PKG expression among four tissues was significantly different using -ACT normalizing PKG expression and the expression levels of PKG normalized using -ACT (least stable) were 7.7fold to 41.1-fold higher than those of PKG normalized using the other two reference genes or gene combinations in fat bodies and 3-fold to 9.2-fold in epidermises. PKG expression normalized by GAPDH or -ACT (the most stable reference gene), the combination of GAPDH and -ACT (the most stable most), and 18S (the least stable) (Figure 4(b) ) was higher in 8L:16D than that in 16L:8D, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05).",

However, to date, there are no universal reference genes that are stably expressed in all types of samples under various treatment conditions. Therefore, the evaluation of reference genes must be conducted prior to gene expression profiling experiments. In this study, we firstly examined the validation of ten reference genes commonly applied in all kinds of organisms in M. separata with four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the \u0394CT method) under various biotic and abiotic conditions. The ranking orders of investigated reference genes across the four programs were varied based on various conditions (Tables 2(a), 2(b), 3, and 4). RefFinder, a web-based algorithm, integrates all data obtained from the four programs mentioned above and determines the stability of selected reference genes by calculation of Geometric Mean values, and those with the lower GM values are identified as more stable genes. RefFinder proposed that EF, -TUB, CypA, and RPL12 are the most stable reference genes for M. separata under all samples (Figure 2 (i)). Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF), a GTP-binding protein that catalyzes the binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the ribosome [40] , was the most stable reference gene for all biotic factors (developmental stages, tissues, and densities) proposed by RefFinder. The stability of EF in two biotic factors (developmental stages and tissues) is in accordance with reference gene analyses in Drosophila melanogaster [41] , Orthoptera [42] , Hymenoptera [43] , and Plutella xylostella [44] and is counter to that in S. exigua [28] . Under temperature treatments, the ranking of EF in M. separata is inconsistent with that in P. xylostella [44] and H. armigera [29] , in which EF was one of the least stable genes. EF was relatively stable across different treatments in M. separata; however, its expression level was low, with a mean CT of 24.49 ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, the expression level of target gene will decide whether EF may be used as a control gene.",

This result was similar to the stabilities of CypA in Hippodamia convergens [46] . However, it was the least under the developmental stages and tissues in Danaus plexippus (L.) [47] . More remarkably, the expression of CypA was unstable among four densities (Figure 2(d) ). Previous study has examined that M. separata larvae reared at high density show higher resistant to nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) than those reared at low density [48] . CypA was also reported to regulate several severe viruses in human [49] . So, further studies are needed to determine whether CypA is involved in the regulation of resistance to NPV in M. separata while controlling for larval density.",
