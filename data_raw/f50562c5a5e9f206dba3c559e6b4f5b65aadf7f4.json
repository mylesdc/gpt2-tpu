An important agent among the latter is the EBV which causes infectious mononucleosis (IM), which generally affects adolescents and young adults, and leads to severe pathologic syndromes such as lymphoproliferative syndrome, B cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Although NPC is relatively rare in Europe (1 case in 100,000 population) [11, 13, 14] , the disease remains a diagnostic challenge because it is diagnosed late in the course of the disease, when the primary tumor has already manifested itself in secondary sites (laterocervical or retroangulomandibular metastasis) and/or loco-regional pathologies (recurrent tubotympanitis, chronic catarrhal otitis media, etc.) [15, 17] .",

That the finding was aspecific is obvious given the characteristics of the respiratory mucosa epithelium, which is composed of a pseudostratified pavimentous epithelium, with nuclear cells arranged at various heights; hence, epithelial cytomorphology does not permit the detection of multinucleation in histologic specimens.
