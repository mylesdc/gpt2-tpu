            "text": "Background: The importance of aerosols in the spread of viruses like influenza is still a subject of debate. Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets. Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two na\u00efve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-\u00b5m and an 8-\u00b5m aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.",

            "text": "Several infectious diseases are known to be transmissible through the airborne route, such as tuberculosis and measles. The only known disease transmitted only through the airborne route is tuberculosis, as reported by Roy and Milton [1] . Aerosol transmission of other diseases could be preferential or opportunistic [1] . Therefore, it is difficult to assess the importance (or not) of the airborne route in disease transmission. The mode of transmission of some diseases is ambiguous. The evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) airborne transmission was first assessed by indirect evidences such as modeling and epidemiological studies [2] . Moreover, the possible airborne transmission of non-respiratory diseases, like Norovirus, is a subject of investigation [3] [4] [5] . All three stainless steel (grade 316 L) cages are identical. The interior dimensions are 864 mm wide by 610 mm deep and 610 mm high for a total volume of 321 L per cage. The cages have perforated grates on the left and right sides as well as a 102-mm-high excreta pan with a perforated lid, which serves as a floor for the animals ( Figure 2 ). The available space for the animals inside the cages is thus 784 mm wide by 610 mm deep by 508 mm in height, which exceeds Canadian and European guidelines for ferret housing (https://www.ccac.ca, https://www.coe.int/). Sampling ports are located between the side grates and the extremities of the cages on the top, back and bottom walls of the cages, thus making the ports inaccessible to the animals. The cages are assembled together with a 7.5-mm rubber seal between cages ( Figure 2 ). The distance between the grates of cages number one and two is 102 mm. produced infectious aerosols containing either both droplets and aerosols or aerosols only. A total of three ferrets could be housed in three individual cages for 10-12 consecutive days ( Figure 1 ). All three stainless steel (grade 316 L) cages are identical.

The cages are assembled together with a 7.5-mm rubber seal between cages ( Figure 2 ). The distance between the grates of cages number one and two is 102 mm. The front panel of each cage is composed of a perforated stainless steel door, which is in direct contact with a transparent polycarbonate door ( Figure 3A ). The polycarbonate door is sealed shut with a 20-mm-thick rubber seal ( Figure 3B ). The purpose of the stainless steel door is to minimize the electrostatic setting of particles on the polycarbonate door.

The polycarbonate door is sealed shut with a 20-mm-thick rubber seal ( Figure 3B ). The purpose of the stainless steel door is to minimize the electrostatic setting of particles on the polycarbonate door. A particle separator module was designed to intercept large particles by impaction while letting smaller particles flow through. The separator is composed of a stainless steel plate with 160 orifices distributed in four rows of 40 orifices ( Figure 5A ). Each orifice is 6.4 mm deep and 5 mm in diameter. An impaction plate is located 5 mm from the outlet of each orifice. The velocity of the airborne particles increases as the air from cage number two is forced into cage number three through the orifices of the particle separation module by a suction pump placed upstream of cage number three. Larger particles are impacted on the impaction plates and smaller particles follow the air stream into cage number three (Figure 5b ).

Nasal washes of ferrets housed in cage three were positive 1-4 days after washes from ferrets housed in cage two were found to be positive for influenza. The delay between the influenza detection schedule in ferrets in cages two and three can be explained by a lower virus concentration in the air and the infection route. Indeed, the airborne influenza virus genome concentration was lower in cage three compared to cage two in 19 out of 20 sampling days. Large particles eliminated by the separator likely contained high virus concentrations. The airborne influenza virus genome concentration in cage three reached 5 \u00d7 10 2 genomes/m 3 only when influenza virus was detected in the nasal wash of the ferret housed in cage two. Therefore, it is possible that the airborne virus concentration in cage three reached the required concentration to transmit the infection only when the ferret housed in cage two showed flu symptoms. More experiments would be required to elucidate this phenomenon.",

The system is airtight and particle size distribution through the system is satisfactory (no significant difference was found for particles <420 nm). The particle separator D 50 can be modulated between 5.07 and 7.8 \u00b5m by changing the airflow. To further reduce the D 50 , plates with smaller holes could replace the actual hole plates of the particle separator. This would lead to more accelerated particles and, therefore, more particles being captured by the impaction plates. Ferrets can be used as models for the study of many mammalian viruses, including filovirus [18] , respiratory syncytial virus [19] and Morbillivirus [20] . Therefore, the studies that can be conducted in this chamber system are not limited to influenza viruses. Moreover, this cage system can be adapted to accommodate other animals like rats or rabbits. Indeed, smaller, regular cages can be placed inside the ventilated airtight cages.",
