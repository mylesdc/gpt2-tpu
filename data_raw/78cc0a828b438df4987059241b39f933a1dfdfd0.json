We link the sequence data to metadata on host type and demography and geographic location, distinguishing hospital patients, members of a cohort identified as a high risk of zoonotic infections (e.g. abattoir workers, rat traders) and animals. these data are suitable for further studies of virus diversity and virus discovery in humans and animals from Vietnam and to identify viruses found in multiple hosts that are potentially zoonotic.",

Detailed demographic, socio-economic and behavioural data relating to food preparation and consumption were collected from each participant; these data are not reported here. A total of 551 samples were sent for metagenomic sequencing. These comprised: Non-human animal study. The high-risk cohort study also included the sampling of associated mammals and birds.

This subset comprised all available rodent and bat samples, and a representative selection from other mammals (Table 3 ). Bat and monkey species were not recorded during sampling, therefore this was predicted by querying the raw reads from bat and monkey samples against mitochondrial DNA databases containing Chiroptera (NCBI:txid9397, February 2017) and Simiiformes (excluding Homo sapiens) (NCBI:txid314293, June 2018) sequences respectively.

Library preparation followed standard Illumina protocols, with up to 96 samples being prepared at a time for multiplex sequencing. Nucleic acids were sheared to 400-500 nucleotides (nt) in length. Distinct 8 nt indexing barcodes were added to each sample's nucleic acid before pooling. Each pool was sequenced divided over two lanes. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq. 2500 machines, yielding up to several million 250 nt paired-end reads per sample. Adapters were trimmed off with Biobambam2 18 . For ethical reasons, human-derived sequences were identified by aligning reads to the GRCh38 reference genome (without Epstein-Barr virus) with BWA-backtrack 19 , and then removed.
