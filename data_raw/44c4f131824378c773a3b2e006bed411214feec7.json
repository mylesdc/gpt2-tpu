We have examined the short-term safety of buprenorphine implants in Fischer F344/NTac rats treated with excess doses of a cholesterol-triglyceride suspension of buprenorphine. A single injection of 0.65 mg/kg afforded clinically significant blood levels of analgesia for 3 days. Chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis values with 2-to 10-fold excess doses of the drug-lipid suspension were within normal limits. Histopathology findings were unremarkable. The skin and underlying tissue surrounding the drug injection were unremarkable. Here we report the results of a long-term follow-up study of female rats injected with 0.65 and 1.3 mg/kg. The 14-month evaluation showed no abnormal findings that could be attributed to the drug or lipid suspension. These results confirm the safety of cholesterol-triglyceride carrier systems for subcutaneous drug delivery in laboratory animals and suggest that this model may be used to study long-term effects of opiate therapy.",

Lipid-based carrier strategies have been refined for the delivery of several opiates [15] . Pontani and Misra described a cholesterol-triglyceride matrix for the long-term delivery of drugs to treat chronic pain and opiate addiction [16] . Cholesterol-triglyceride vehicles appeared to provide a promising carrier to examine the delivery of antibiotics, antiinflammatory drugs, and analgesics for pain management in animals. Yet, solid cholesterol-based implants can be sequestered by interstitial tissues and create drug-containing depots with uncertain release kinetics [17] . Subsequent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol suspensions provide consistent release kinetics with little evidence of tissue sequestration effects [18] .",

The label dose of 0.65 mg/kg of buprenorphine, which provides 2-3 days of clinically significant blood levels of drug, was established in bioequivalence trials and efficacy studies using male and female rats [21] . The 12 female rats in this study were divided into groups of 4 rats provided 0.0, 0.65, and 1.3 mg/kg buprenorphine. Cage side evaluations were conducted twice daily in the morning and afternoons for two weeks by a veterinarian who was blind to the dose group. Rats were evaluated at weekly intervals by staff veterinary services thereafter. Rats were scheduled for harvesting and clinical pathology studies at 1 year and actual 14 months. Anomalies or abnormalities discovered during necroscopy were further examined by histopathology. The hypothesis was that rats treated with the highest dose would have tissue changes near the injection site not found in the control group. To limit stress associated with constraining conscious animals for SC injections, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) solution of ketamine, 80 mg/kg, and xylazine, 8 mg/kg, in a saline solution containing 14.25% ethyl alcohol. Each rat was injected with the designated dose of test article or buprenorphine-free control suspension before they recovered from anesthesia. The dose was administered SC on the mid-dorsal area about 1 cm rostral to the surgical incision using a 21 gauge needle (BD, Franklin NJ) attached to a 1 mL BD Tuberculin syringe. Following dose administration, animals were transferred to a clean cage on a heating pad until recovered. Once the animal regained consciousness and demonstrated normal movement, and with the absence of signs of distress, it was returned to its home cage. Posttreatment distress was not observed.",

Other findings included one rat in the control group: cystic uterine (endometrial) polyp less than 4mm diameter, and one rat in the 0.65 mg/kg dose group: ovarian cyst \u223c1cm diameter. Mild cardiac changes (inflammation, degeneration, and fibrosis), mild nephropathy with pigment in tubule epithelium, mild lung inflammatory changes, and micromineralization of lung vasculature were observed in all groups. Pigmented macrophages in lymph nodes and spleen were observed in all rats. One rat in the 0.65 mg/kg group had an ovarian cyst and one in the vehicle control group had a uterine polyp.

Female rats were chosen for a long-term trial because female rats may have increased susceptibility to opiates [22] , although sex differences have not been fully determined. The results confirmed that lipid-based delivery system caused no significant adverse effects in a F344 rat model. One rat illustrated signs of nausea at days 1-2, signs that have been observed previously [23] . The incidence of nausea in this model appears similar to the observed incidence of nausea in human patients treated with opioid analgesia [24] .",
