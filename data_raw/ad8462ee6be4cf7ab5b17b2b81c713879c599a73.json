            "text": "Human pathogenic positive single strand RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses, including Chikungunya virus, pose severe health problems as for many neither efficient vaccines nor therapeutic strategies exist. To interfere with propagation, viral enzymatic activities are considered potential targets. Here we addressed the function of the viral macrodomains, conserved folds of non-structural proteins of many (+)ssRNA viruses. Macrodomains are closely associated with ADP-ribose function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification controlling various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and stress response. We found that the viral macrodomains possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD10 (aka PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10, respectively), reverting this posttranslational modification both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, the viral macrodomains possess only weak activity towards poly-ADP-ribose chains synthesized by ARTD1 (aka PARP1). Unlike poly-ADPribosylglycohydrolase, which hydrolyzes poly-ADP-ribose chains to individual ADP-ribose units but cannot cleave the amino acid side chain -ADP-ribose bond, the different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP-ribose chains with distinct efficiency. Mutational and structural analyses identified key amino acids for hydrolase activity of the Chikungunya viral macrodomain. Moreover, ARTD8 and ARTD10 are induced by innate immune mechanisms, suggesting that the control of mono-ADP-ribosylation is part of a host-pathogen conflict.",

            "text": "ADP-ribosylation describes a posttranslational modification (PTM) in which an ADP-ribose (ADPr) moiety is transferred from NAD + onto substrate proteins with release of nicotinamide. Intracellular ADP-ribosylation is mainly catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as PARP family) 1 . Based on their biochemical features ARTDs can be subdivided into three groups: members of the first group (including ARTD1/2/5/6) are able to iteratively transfer multiple ADPr units onto their substrates resulting in the formation of long branched ADPr polymers (PAR). Group II enzymes (ARTD7/8/10-12/14-17) are restricted to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), in part due to the lack of a catalytically active glutamate. The latter have been suggested to use substrate-assisted catalysis to modify their targets 2,3 . Whether ARTD3 and 4 belong to group I or II, despite both having a catalytic glutamate, is somewhat controversial and requires further analyses 3 . Acceptor amino acids for ADP-ribosylation are still a matter of debate with some discrepancy between biochemical and mass spectrometry studies. Nevertheless, acidic amino acids are considered important acceptor sites for both group I and II enzymes 4 . Our own findings with ARTD10 strongly suggest that glutamates are the main sites of modification 2 . Proteins of the third group (ARTD9/13) lost the ability to bind NAD + due to amino acid substitutions in the NAD + binding pocket and therefore are catalytically inactive 1,5 . Recent evidence defines reader domains that are capable of interacting specifically with MARylated or poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) substrates and thus participate in disseminating the information associated with this PTM 6,7 . Moreover, erasers have been identified that hydrolyze bonds between single ADPr units and between ADPr and the modified amino acid, defining ADP-ribosylation as a fully reversible PTM 7,8 .",

Several macrodomains, including the one of the core histone macroH2A1.1, interact with ADPr polymers 7,9 . Others bind selectively to MARylated substrates, as shown for macrodomain 2 (macro2) or macrodomain 3 (macro3) of murine Artd8 10 . The macrodomains of ARTD7 are poorly characterized, while those of ARTD9 have been suggested to affect transcription and the DNA damage response 7,8 . Importantly, some macrodomains possess enzymatic activity. For example, the macrodomain of poly-ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (PARG) degrades PAR chains, whereas the macrodomains of TARG1, MacroD1 and MacroD2 remove the terminal, protein bound ADPr unit 11-14 . Thus the latter enzymes hydrolyze the ester bond between the ADPr and a most likely acidic acceptor amino acid 11,12 . Together these findings document the important role of macrodomain folds in regulating ADP-ribosylation function and metabolism.",

A growing body of information suggests functions for MARylation at the interface between host and pathogens 3 . On the one hand MARylation of host proteins is catalyzed by a range of bacterial toxins, thereby promoting pathogenesis 16 . Thus MARylation is a conserved mechanism for host protein modulation to promote virulence. On the other hand accumulating evidence links intracellular MARylation to the innate immune response 17 . Infection of human monocytes by Borrelia burghdorferi results in elevated expression of ARTD8, 10 and 12 18 . In line with these findings, the expression of these three genes is also induced by interferon (IFN) responsive factor 1 as part of an antiviral program 19 . Moreover, monitoring the IFN response by a reporter gene construct defined ARTD10 as a type I IFN-stimulated gene 20 . ARTD7, 10 and 12 are induced upon IFN\u03b2 stimulation and inhibit alphavirus replication 21 . Furthermore, these proteins participate in repression of protein translation when combined with viral infection 21, 22 . In addition to these molecular and cell biological studies, evolutionary analyses indicate a broad role of ADP-ribosylation in virus-host interactions 23 . Several ARTD family members are under strong recurrent positive selection, including ARTD7, 8 and 9, the three ARTD family members possessing macrodomains as well as the catalytically inactive ARTD13 23 . The latter has been well established in antiviral immune defense. ARTD13 interferes with viral RNA translation and replication by interaction with viral RNA through its four CCCH-type zinc fingers thereby promoting its degradation 3 . Taken together these findings strongly imply important functions for ARTD family members in innate immunity and thus suggest that ADP-ribosylation and its functional consequences contribute to the resolution of host-pathogen conflicts.",

These ((+ ) ssRNA) viruses include members of the alphavirus genus such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV); members of the orthohepevirus genus among them Hepatitis E virus (HEV), as well as members of the alphacoronavirus genus, to which Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus (FIPV), a mutant of Feline coronavirus, belongs. Some of these viruses are human pathogens. For example CHIKV, transmitted by mosquitoes, has resulted in large epidemics in recent years. One of its effects is severe joint pain that can last for months or even years, thus having considerable long-term effects on human health 26, 27 .

Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus harbors two additional macrodomain folds in the SARS-unique domain, which lack ADPr binding, but instead interact with G-quadruplexes 31-34 . Very recently ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity has been reported for the viral macrodomains of HEV, SARS (the macrodomain fold of the X domain), and VEEV 35 . Several findings provide evidence for a biological relevance of vMDs. Mutation of the ADPr binding region of the SINV macrodomain of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) impairs viral replication in neurons 36 . Mutations in the vMD with ADRP activity of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E resulted in increased sensitivity to the antiviral effect of IFN\u03b1 compared with their wildtype counterparts 37 . Moreover, the mouse hepatitis virus macrodomain promotes virulence in mice 38 . vMDs thus seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response.",

In order to identify stimuli driving ARTD10 expression, a fragment of the ARTD10 promoter (\u2212 532 to + 491 relative to the start of transcription) was cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter gene construct. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with this reporter gene construct and stimulated with the antiviral defense-inducing cytokine IFN\u03b1 . This stimulated the ARTD10 promoter reporter gene construct in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1a) , in accordance with previous findings 20 . IFN\u03b1 also promoted endogenous ARTD10 protein synthesis in these cells (Fig. 1b) . Next we analyzed endogenous ARTD10 Figure 1 . Expression of ARTD8 and ARTD10 is stimulated by interferon \u03b1. (a) A fragment of the human ARTD10 promoter (\u2212 532 to + 491 relative to the start of transcription) was cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene. This construct was transfected together with a \u03b2 -galactosidase expressing plasmid into U2OS cells, which were then stimulated with the indicated amounts of interferon (IFN) \u03b1 . 24 h later the relative luciferase activity was determined. Mean values \u00b1 SD of three experiments. (b) Untransfected U2OS cells were treated with IFN\u03b1 in parallel to the cells in panel A and whole cell lysates analyzed for ARTD10 expression by immunoblotting using mAb 5H11. (c-f) HeLa and U2OS cells were stimulated with IFN\u03b1 for the indicated times. The expression of ARTD10 and ARTD8 mRNA was measured using RT-qPCR (mean values \u00b1 SD of three experiments). ARTD10 and ARTD8 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting using mAb 5H11 (panels c and d) and peptide-specific pAb (panels e and f), respectively. gene expression. IFN\u03b1 stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in HeLa and U2OS cells ( Fig. 1c and d) , consistent with our reporter gene assays. Similarly to the findings for ARTD10, ARTD8 expression was also induced by IFN\u03b1 resulting in elevated mRNA and protein levels in HeLa and U2OS cells ( Fig. 1e and f) . To detect ARTD8 protein levels we made use of an antibody generated against a peptide derived from the sequence located between macrodomain 2 and 3 of ARTD8 ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). Analogous to IFN\u03b1 , lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern, stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in differentiated THP-1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ), but not in undifferentiated cells (data not shown). Of note is that both IFN\u03b1 and LPS stimulated ARTD10 and ARTD8 expression with some delay, indicating that the induction of these genes is probably indirect rather than through direct activation of IFN receptor downstream signaling events. Taken together our results support the notion that mono-ARTDs like ARTD8 and ARTD10 play a role in the first line immune response that is induced in consequence of stimuli such as IFN\u03b1 and LPS. Our observations and published findings let us hypothesize a function for MARylation in the immune defense against pathogens.",

We purified His 6 -tagged fusion proteins of several vMDs, TARG1, Artd8-macro2 and -macro3 and performed hydrolase assays on automodified, MARylated GST-fusion proteins of the catalytic domains of ARTD10, ARTD8, and ARTD7, and on MARylated NEMO, an ARTD10 substrate 40 (Figs 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. S2 ).

The inhibitory effect of ADPr was concentration dependent. Titration of the CHIKV macrodomain further demonstrated robust hydrolase activity. Even at low protein concentrations the CHIKV macrodomain reversed MARylation efficiently (Fig. 3d ). The products released by the CHIKV macrodomain were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and found to migrate identically to the products obtained from PARGcat-treated, automodified ARTD1 (Fig. 3e) .

Treatment of the cells with the ARTD1 inhibitor Olaparib as well as incubation with PARGcat served as control 42, 43 . Moreover, Olaparib was added to the lysis buffer to prevent automodification during cell lysis. In agreement with the results from the in vitro modified ARTD1 above, PARylation was affected to some extend dependent on the identity of the vMD (Fig. 4c and d) . But in contrast to the in vitro assays, the reductions in response to the CHIKV, ONNV and SINV macrodomains were significant, although not comparable to the effects in response to incubation with PARGcat (Fig. 4d) .

These results were corroborated by analyzing the released 32 P-labeled PAR chains on sequencing gels and the remaining protein-bound PAR by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S5b and c). Based on these findings we suggest that MARylated proteins are the preferred substrates of the different vMDs analyzed, but apparently at least some of the vMDs can gain access to the amino acid side chain -ribose bond of a PAR modified substrate and thus remove complete PAR chains.

            "text": "Mutational analysis of the CHIKV macrodomain defines catalytically important amino acids. The catalytic mechanism of macrodomain ADP-ribosylhydrolases is not fully understood [11] [12] [13] . To obtain information about amino acids relevant for catalytic activity, we focused on the published crystal structure of the CHIKV macrodomain in complex with ADPr 25 . This was chosen as no structural information of a macrodomain in complex with a MARylated substrate, i.e. peptide or protein, has been reported thus far. We performed in silico analyses to identify amino acids facing the ADPr binding pocket that contribute to ADPr binding ( Fig. 5a and b) . The procedure allowed identifying important amino acids for ligand recognition. All amino acids within a distance of 5 \u00c5 from the ADPr were subjected to in silico alanine (A) scanning. The obtained mutants were ranked according to the difference in interaction score with respect to the wildtype (WT) protein (\u2206 \u2206 G values) (Fig. 5c ). For each of the three best hits (arginine (N) 24, valine (V) 33, and tyrosine (Y) 114) site-directed mutagenesis of the WT CHIKV macrodomain was performed and the amino acids were changed to alanine (N24A, V33A, and Y114A). His 6 -tagged fusion proteins of the CHIKV macrodomain mutants were purified and subjected to hydrolase assays of MARylated GST-ARTD10cat for the indicated times (Fig. 5d ). The vMD mutants showed less hydrolase activity compared to the WT protein, indicating that the three identified amino acids are important for substrate binding and/or catalysis, but still exhibited a visible de-MARylation. To obtain macrodomain mutants with a more substantial loss of enzymatic activity, we evaluated the energetics of ligand/protein interaction for every possible amino acid substitution of each of the three positions (Supplementary Table S1 ). Based on these scores we generated additional mutants (Fig. 6) . We replaced N24 with arginine (R) and tyrosine (Y) (Fig. 6a) , V33 with glutamate (E) and phenylalanine (F) (Fig. 6c) , and Y114 with valine (V) and tryptophan (W) (Fig. 6e) . In subsequent hydrolase assays with MARylated ARTD10cat as substrate all mutants showed reduced catalytic activity, with N24R, N24Y, V33E, and Y114V being inactive compared to the control incubations in the absence of vMD protein (Fig. 6b, d and f ). In addition to ARTD10, we evaluated the hydrolase activity of the V33E and Y144V mutant towards PARylation catalyzed by ARTD1. Therefore, hydrolase assays were performed as described before and the released products were analyzed by TLC ( Supplementary Fig. S6a ). The mutants were inactive, analogous to the results obtained with the MARylated ARTD10cat domain as substrate. N24 faces the ADPr binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate-linked ribose ring (Fig. 5b) . In this position it might also influence the recognition of the substrate, i.e. a MARylated protein. When mutated to A, R or Y this hydrogen bond is lost. In addition, the N24Y mutant, due to the prediction that the tyrosine can rotate (Fig. 6a , arrow), might have reduced substrate binding. Moreover, the N24R is suggested to affect the positioning of the ligand and as a consequence may also reduce substrate binding. V33 is deeply buried in the binding cavity and forms a hydrogen bond between its backbone nitrogen and the diphosphate of ADPr (Figs 5b and 6c ). This hydrogen bond can be maintained in the V33A mutant. However, when bulky amino acids like E or F replace V33, they might reduce the accessible volume of the binding site, and therefore hamper the correct binding of the substrate. Moreover, specifically for the V33E mutant, the negative charge of E might also introduce an electrostatic repulsion effect with the phosphate groups of the ADPr. Although not obvious from the crystal structure but based on molecular dynamics 39 , hydrogen bonds are formed between Y114 and the diphosphate as well as the terminal ribose ring of ADPr. Similar to N24 it might also play a role in substrate recognition. When substituted with A, V or W the hydrogen bond with the terminal ribose ring is lost. Taking together N24, V33, and Y114 are important for ligand binding and possibly substrate recognition (N24 and Y114) and thus are necessary for enzymatic activity of the CHIKV macrodomain.",

            "text": "To obtain more information about the consequences of these mutations with regard to structural integrity of the macrodomain fold, the purified CHIKV macrodomain proteins were analyzed using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. All mutants showed a spectrum very similar to the WT protein, indicating that the overall structure was not or only minimally affected by the different point mutations (Supplementary Fig. S6b and c) . Thus, our findings suggest that the catalytically inactive mutants are structurally intact but have impaired ADPr and possibly altered substrate binding, providing a molecular explanation for the biochemical observations. CHIKV-nsP3 full-length possesses hydrolase activity similar to the isolated vMD. The macrodomain of CHIKV is located at the N-terminus of nsP3, a multi-functional protein that is only partially characterized. To address whether the vMD is also active in full-length nsP3 of CHIKV, His 6 -tagged nsP3 was bacterially expressed and purified and tested for its hydrolase activity (Fig. 7) . Comparable to the isolated macrodomain, CHIKV full-length nsP3 was capable of reverting MARylation of GST-ARTD10cat (Fig. 7a) . Free ADPr impeded the removal of MARylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7b) , similar to the finding with the isolated vMD (Fig. 3c ). Next we determined whether the amino acids, which were identified as important for activity of the isolated vMD (Fig. 5) , were also relevant for hydrolase activity of full-length nsP3 (Fig. 7c) . Indeed, substitution of V33 with E or Y114 with V resulted in a loss of enzymatic activity. Finally, we tested full-length nsP3 on in vitro PARylated ARTD1 and, comparable to the isolated vMD, measured only weak hydrolase activity (Fig. 7d and e) . Again, the comparison to the quantified activity of full-length nsP3 on MARylated ARTD10cat revealed a substantial difference to its effect on PARylated ARTD1 (Fig. 7e and f) . Together these results demonstrate that the CHIKV macrodomain, either on its own or as part of nsP3, possesses robust hydrolase activity towards several MARylated substrates. In contrast, ARTD1-bound PAR chains are only rather inefficiently hydrolyzed.",

            "text": "To address whether the CHIKV macrodomain functions in cells, we co-expressed the vMD or the full-length nsP3 with ARTD10 in cells. As a tool to detect intracellularly MARylated proteins we used GFP-fusion proteins of macrodomains 2 and 3 of Artd8 (GFP-Artd8-macro2-3), previously identified to function as binding modules specific for MARylated proteins 10 , that were stably expressed in HEK293 cells. In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using GFP-specific antibodies, we measured bound ARTD10-WT and ARTD10-G888W, a catalytically inactive mutant, as a means to assess MARylation (Fig. 8a) . As expected, GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 interacted with MARylated ARTD10-WT but poorly with ARTD10-G888W. Co-expression of the CHIKV macrodomain or nsP3 hampered binding of ARTD10 to GFP-Artd8-macro2-3, whereas co-expression of mutants with reduced hydrolase activity (nsP3-V33E, nsP3-Y114V) showed little effect. Because binding between GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 and ARTD10 is dependent on MARylation of ARTD10, these experiments strongly indicated that the CHIKV macrodomain was capable of reverting MARylation of ARTD10 in cells. Nonetheless, the expression of the vMD might have unanticipated consequences. Therefore, we wanted to apply an additional experimental set-up. For this we made use of an antibody initially made against PAR, which we found to also interact with the automodified, MARylated catalytic domain of ARTD10 (Fig. 8b) . Thus in addition to the co-IP experiments with GFP-Artd8-macro2-3, we analyzed MARylation of immunoprecipitated ARTD10 using the \u03b1 -ADPr antibody. We observed a signal of overexpressed and immunoprecipitated ARTD10-WT but not of ARTD10-G888W from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 8c) . When the CHIKV macrodomain was co-expressed, MARylation of ARTD10-WT was reduced (Fig. 8c ). In line with these experiments co-localization of GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 with ARTD10-WT in cells was reduced upon co-expression of the CHIKV macrodomain (Fig. 8d) . While GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 was almost exclusively associated with ARTD10-WT dots 10, 44 , it relocated throughout the cell when the vMD was co-expressed. This was comparable to the distribution of GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 in the presence of the catalytically inactive ARTD10-G888W. Of note, the ARTD10-WT dots showed some co-localization with GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 in the presence of the CHIKV macrodomain, probably because the vMD was unable to remove all MARylation. Together these findings provide strong support for intracellular hydrolase activity of the CHIKV macrodomain towards MARylated ARTD10.",

Both mono-ARTDs show N-terminally localized putative RNA recognition motifs that might be relevant to recognize foreign RNA of invading pathogens, which could function as a signal to further develop an appropriate immune response 1 . In that respect it is worth noting that ARTD10 interferes with NF-\u03ba B signaling, a pathway that is critical for shaping immune cell functions 40 . Additional findings support a role of ARTDs in antiviral defense. These include the antiviral role of ARTD13 and the proposed evolution of several ARTDs in response to pathogens 17, 23 . Moreover, several mono-ARTDs are associated with stress granules, structures that have been implicated in the control of replication of some viruses 47 . Furthermore, and in more general terms, PTMs, including phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation, which fulfill essential roles in controlling protein activities in cells, are manipulated by pathogens to promote infection and propagation 48 . Thus the information we have so far about mono-ARTDs suggests that MARylation is a likely target of viruses. This is now supported by our findings that vMDs function as mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases.",

IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; WCL, whole cell lysate. CHIKV-nsP3 full-length support this novel enzymatic activity for vMDs (Figs 5, 6 and 7) . All tested vMDs appear to elicit broad catalytic activity as they de-MARylate automodified ARTD7, ARTD8, ARTD10 and MARylated NEMO, an ARTD10 substrate 40 . Moreover, ARTD10, and possibly the other substrates as well, is modified at multiple sites 2 . This enhances substrate complexity supporting our interpretation of broad catalytic activity. This is also consistent with the findings discussed above that multiple mono-ARTDs are potentially associated with antiviral activity and thus vMDs are expected to be capable of de-MARylating multiple substrates. We demonstrated that ARTD10 is also de-MARylated in cells suggesting that vMDs can function intracellularly (Fig. 8) . What the relevant substrates are that need to be de-MARylated in virally infected cells remains to be determined. Our understanding about MARylated substrates is very limited at present and only few proteins have been demonstrated to be modified in cells 10, 11, 40 . Thus it will be interesting to define relevant targets of the catalytic activities of vMDs and to understand the biological consequences of MARylation and de-MARylation and their potential importance for virus propagation. Some vMDs have been described to interact with PAR chains 25, 49, 50 . Taking the overall highly positive electrostatic surface potential of vMDs into account 25 , binding to negatively charged molecules like PAR is not unexpected and specificity is a concern. Despite this interaction, we could not detect substantial hydrolase activity of the vMDs towards PAR chains synthesized on ARTD1 (Figs 4 and 7, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5) . Of note is that the linkage between the protein and its proximal ADPr, an ester bond with an acidic amino acid, is different from the ribose-ribosyl O-glycosidic bond found within PAR chains. Thus it is likely that different catalytic mechanisms are needed to either trim PAR chains or to cleave the bond between the amino acid side chain and ADPr, being it a PAR chain or a single ADPr unit. Distinguishing between the latter will depend on whether the vMDs are able to accommodate the amino acid -ribose ester bond in the active center despite one or more additional ADPr units bound to the amino acid linked ADPr, as in PAR chains. Looking at the crystal structure of the CHIKV macrodomain in complex with ADPr it might be possible that this vMD can interact with a PAR chain 25 . However, our findings suggest that none of the tested vMDs, including the one of CHIKV, has strong activity against PARylated ARTD1. This argues that the amino acid -ribose ester bond of PAR chains is less well accessible and/or positioned in the active center compared to the respective bond in a MARylated substrate. As a consequence, complete PAR chains are less efficiently released than mono-ADPr from substrates.",

We note that the results suggesting activity against PAR chains are not easy to interpret due to significant background in some experiments 35 . Moreover, ARTD1 was 32 P-ADP-ribosylated under low NAD + conditions, which have been shown by others to also result in substantial MARylation in addition to PARylation 12 . Thus, the release of radioactivity from labeled ARTD1 might be at least in part due to the hydrolysis of MARylation. This is consistent with our findings that all vMDs tested are significantly more active towards MARylation compared to PARylation (Figs 4 and 7, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 ). An additional aspect that is worth considering relates to the findings that ARTD1 has been reported to not only modify acidic amino acids but also lysines 51, 52 . Thus it might be that the vMDs remove PAR chains from glutamate or aspartate but not from lysine, as the biochemical reaction would be expected to be rather distinct. Together, the findings strongly suggest that these vMDs have evolved specifically as de-MARylating enzymes.",

            "text": "Based on in silico analysis of the CHIKV macrodomain, amino acids N24, V33 and Y114 were suggested to be important for ligand binding and thus most likely for catalytic activity (Figs 5 and 6 ). Up to date a precise and validated catalytic mechanism that explains the removal of the protein-proximal ADPr is lacking 11, 12, 14 . Our experimental results obtained with CHIKV macrodomain mutants, which were based on in silico alanine scanning and calculating Amber scores, are also in agreement with molecular dynamic simulations proposing N24, V33 and Y114 of the CHIKV macrodomain to be important for enzyme-substrate interaction and N24 and Y114 for catalysis 39 . Having shown that the inactivating mutations, including V33E and Y114V, do not affect the overall structure of the CHIKV macrodomain ( Supplementary Fig. S6b ), it will now be important to address their biological relevance for viral replication. In that respect the reported findings on HEV macrodomain mutations are worth discussing 35 . A strong effect on replication is observed with a triple mutation (G48S/G49S/G50A), which shows reduced binding to PAR chains. It will be interesting to determine whether this is due to reduced catalytic activity or altered structure of the macrodomain. The latter could have effects on the overall function of ORF1 or nsP3. Indeed, the macrodomain of HEV interacts with other non-structural proteins, which has been suggested to be of functional relevance for viral replication 53 , that might be abolished by structural changes. Of note is also that the G48/G49/G50 motif in HEV is conserved in other vMDs (e.g. SINV (GEG), VEEV (GGG), CHIKV (GDG), ONNV (GDG), and FIPV (VGG)). Within this motif the respective Aspartate 31 of the CHIKV macrodomain was considered in our in silico analysis but substitution by alanine resulted in a highly negative \u2206 \u2206 G value, suggesting that this change would rather stabilize the interaction with ADP-ribose. Therefore, we did not further evaluate D31 (Fig. 5c) .",

This suggests, together with the IFN\u03b1 responsiveness of several mono-ARTDs as well as published findings, that MARylation is a PTM that is relevant for the innate immune response. Our previous studies on ARTD10 and ARTD8 substrates suggest that multiple signaling pathways are regulated by MARylation 11, 40, 54 . However, for most of the potential substrates the functional consequences of MARylation are not known and more strinkingly most of the substrates of MARylation are probably not even identified until now. Also, how mono-ARTDs are controlled, beyond effects on gene transcription, is poorly understood. Taken together, this highlights MARylation as a PTM of emerging relevance with the potential for an important role in viral defense or more generally in host-pathogen conflicts.",
