CoV N proteins form oligomers but the mechanism and relevance underlying their multimerization remain to be fully understood. Using in vitro pulldown experiments and density glycerol gradients, we found that at least 3 regions distributed over its entire length mediate the self-interaction of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein. The fact that these regions can bind reciprocally between themselves provides a possible molecular basis for N protein oligomerization. Interestingly, cytoplasmic N molecules of MHV-infected cells constitutively assemble into oligomers through a process that does not require binding to genomic RNA. Based on our data, we propose a model where constitutive N protein oligomerization allows the optimal loading of the genomic viral RNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex via the presentation of multiple viral RNA binding motifs.",

Subsequently, native gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance revealed that recombinant SARS-CoV N protein forms oligomers in vitro, although it appears to predominantly exist as a dimer in solution in absence of gRNA 30 . Size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays were also used to unveil that the N2b/CTD domain of the SARS-CoV N protein, in particular the stretch of amino acids between positions 343-402, forms autonomously oligomers in solution 31, 32 . The N2b/CTD domain of the MHV N protein has also been shown to bind full length protein 11 . However, few other studies indicated that other parts of the N protein could also be involved in the self-interaction. In particular, the N1b/NTD and N3 domains could bind full length MHV N protein 11, 19 while the serine-rich (SR) region located within the N2a could be essential for SAR-CoV N protein self-interaction and oligomerization 33 . Nonetheless, the current most commonly accepted working model is that CoV N protein constitutively dimerizes, primarily via the N2b/CTD domain, and subsequently oligomerizes during virion assembly through a mechanism that remains unclear 22, 23, 27, 29, 32, [34] [35] [36] . It is also unclear whether gRNA binding influences CoV N protein oligomerization. In this study, we confirm that recombinant MHV and SARS-CoV N protein self-interact to form large oligomers. However, we could also show that, besides N2b/CTD, several domains of the N protein are involved in this process. Analysis of different MHV and SARS-CoV N protein truncations revealed that at least three regions of these proteins cross-interact between each other in an interchangeable manner. Moreover, we show that two of these regions, i.e. N1 and N2b-N3, can oligomerize autonomously. Further, in infected cells, the MHV N protein forms oligomers already in the cytoplasm and its oligomerization does not require binding to gRNA. Altogether these findings indicate that CoV N proteins self-interact and oligomerize via discontinuous regions present in domains distributed over the entire protein to generate large supra-complexes. We hypothesize that these oligomers, which are formed constitutively, provide a larger binding surface for the gRNA, which will be thus optimally engaged at the RTCs and subsequently incorporated into forming viral particles.",

To gain insights into the self-assembly mechanism of the N protein, we decided to use an in vitro approach to exclude the eventual involvement of other factors in this event. Since order-disorder and secondary structure predictions coupled with sequence alignment has highlighted that all CoV N proteins have the modular organization as MHV N protein, we used this as a model first. Hence, MHV N protein was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion construct and purified using glutathione Sepharose (GSH-beads). The immobilized GST fusion protein or GST was incubated with bacterial cell extract of E. coli expressing recombinant 6xHis-tagged full length MHV N protein. As illustrated in Fig. 1b , recombinant 6xHis-tagged N protein specifically bound GST-N protein but not GST alone, which is in agreement with previous reports 19, 23, 24, [27] [28] [29] and further shows that N proteins self-interact directly.",

We generated cell extracts (Ext) from MHV-infected LR7 cells and centrifuged them at 15,000 \u00d7 g to discard the pellet P13, which includes compartments with low sedimentation rates such as whole cells or debris, nuclei and mitochondria. The resulting supernatant S13 was subsequently centrifuged at 110,000 \u00d7 g to sediment organelles such as the Golgi apparatus but also virions that could have remained associated to the cell surface at the moment of the lysis 43, 44 . Successful fractionation of each step was followed by visualization of the membrane bound protein VAPA for P13 45 as well as the cytoplasmic proteins GAPDH and tubulin for S45, which also contained soluble N protein (Fig. 2a) .

This could be due to either a slight inhibition of recombinant N protein self-interaction caused by the 6xHis tag, or a better oligomerization in vivo because of cellular factors such as molecular chaperones.

Similarly to MHV, however, SARS-CoV-N2a was unable to self-interact and form oligomers (Supplementary Fig. S3 ).

We and others, however, have already pointed out that the N-terminal N1b/NTD and N3 regions could also interact with full length of MHV N protein 11, 19 . Our data extends and completes the information acquired by these investigations as we found that at least three areas of MHV N protein, i.e. N1a-N1b, N2a and N2b-N3, mediate its self-interaction. Importantly, those domains can bind reciprocally between themselves (Fig. 3 ) and our findings provide a possible model for MHV N protein oligomerization, i.e. a single N molecule appears to have several binding sites that allow the association of multiple N protein units to a single oligomer. However, we cannot exclude that binding promiscuousity and affinity of the various N protein domains, which we have investigated using truncated proteins, are more limited and different, respectively, in the context of the full-length protein.",

This is in agreement with a report indicating that the N2a domain, in particular the SR region within it, could play a role for SARS-CoV N protein self-interaction and oligomerization 33 . Further, the N2a domain is known to interact with the nonstructural protein nsp3 via a serine and arginine rich stretch within that domain [9] [10] [11] .

The results obtained with the N2a truncation indirectly support this notion as a short domain will possess less key binding amino acids and consequently it will interact less pronouncedly compared to longer parts such as the N1 and N2b-N3 domains. Previous efforts to localize the residues essential to mediate SARS-CoV N2b-N3 (including the CTD) multimerization identified three different regions within this domain 22, 31, 34 , further underscoring the notion that discontinues binding regions, distributed over the entire N molecule, are responsible for the self-association. During the preparation of this manuscript, a cryo-EM analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes isolated MHV virions was published and the model emerging from this work is consistent with our findings 48 . This study suggested that the N protein form octamers mainly via its CTD domain, which then further assembles into larger oligomeric structures that can acquire either a loose or a more compact intertwined filament shape 48 . In the proposed model, multiple surfaces of the N protein participate in the multimerization of the N protein octamer and this is coherent with our conclusion that several domains in the N protein mediate self-interaction.",

Similarly to the recombinant protein, we could not detect monomers, dimers or small multimers on glycerol gradients (Fig. 2b) suggesting that after synthesis, MHV N protein rapidly assembles into oligomers. It is easy to imagine that, based on our in vitro data, this is very likely also the case for the SARS-CoV N protein. Since all CoV N proteins have an identical modular organization 21 and have the N1b, N2a and N2b domains, oligomerization could be a characteristic that all of them possess. It has been suggested that gRNA promotes MHV N protein self-interaction because the association process was partially or largely susceptible to RNase A treatment 11, 35 . Another study, however, reached the opposite conclusion 19 , which is also supported by structural biology studies where N protein multimers have been detected and analyzed in preparations that do not contain RNA 12, 22-24, 27, 29, 32, 36, 49 . Our data showing that both in vivo and in vitro N protein oligomerization does not depend on its binding to gRNA are in agreement with this latter conclusion. It cannot be excluded, however, that association to gRNA could promote further N protein oligomerization. This could explain the partial discrepancy with the study showing that RNase A treatment interferes with the binding between the N protein and full-length N protein or N1b/NTD domain, but not with the N2b/CTD region 11 .",

Transformed Escherichia coli BL-21 were grown in 125 ml of LB medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone, 1% NaCl) to late exponential phase and after inducing protein expression by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C or 20 \u00b0C for 4 h or 16 h, respectively. Bacteria were harvested, resuspended in 4 ml lysis buffer (PBS, 5 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and lysed by two sonication rounds of 10 sec using a Branson sonicator (Danbury, Connecticut, United States). The bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and passed through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. For purification of GST fusion proteins, lysates were incubated with 125 \u00b5l of glutathione (GSH) Sepharose (4B, GE Healthcare), which had been pre-washed in PBS. Where indicated, lysates were incubated with 40 mg/ml RNase A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min on ice prior to addition to the GSH Sepharose. Cell extracts from bacteria expressing the 6xHis-tagged proteins were used either directly for pull-down experiments or for the purification of the fusion proteins with nickel Sepharose (6 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) after incubation in presence or absence of 40 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min on ice. Complete hydrolysis of RNA was verified by sample analysis on an agarose gel followed by nucleic acid staining with Midori Green (GC Biotech, Netherlands) or determination of the A260/A280 ratio through measurement of A260 and A280 using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Implen, Germany) 54-56 . Cell extracts. For the preparation of cell extracts, LR7 cells grown on 10 cm dishes were mocked-treated or inoculated with MHV at a MOI of 1 and after 8 h, they were lysed by 5 min sonication in 1.2 ml of PBS buffer supplemented as described above. Supernatants were then cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and passed through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. RNase A treatments were carried out by incubating 200 \u00b5l of cell extract with 40 mg/ml of enzyme for 30 min on ice, immediately prior to pull-downs.",
