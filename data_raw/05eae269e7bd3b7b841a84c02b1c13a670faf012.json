Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an enveloped herpesvirus, enters endothelial cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Whether ubiquitination and proteasome activity regulates KSHV entry and endocytosis remains unknown. We showed that inhibition of proteasome activity reduced KSHV entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to nuclei, thus preventing KSHV infection of the cells. Three-dimensional (3-D) analyses revealed accumulation of KSHV particles in a cytoplasmic compartment identified as EEA1+ endosomal vesicles upon proteasome inhibition. KSHV particles are colocalized with ubiquitin-binding proteins epsin and eps15. Furthermore, ubiquitination mediates internalization of both KSHV and one of its receptors integrin b1. KSHV particles are colocalized with activated forms of the E3 ligase c-Cbl. Knock-down of c-Cbl or inhibition of its phosphorylation reduced viral entry and intracellular trafficking, resulting in decreased KSHV infectivity. These results demonstrate that ubiquitination mediates internalization of both KSHV and one of its cognate receptors integrin b1, and identify c-Cbl as a potential E3 ligase that facilitates this process.",

The possible role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the internalization of KSHV and its cognate receptor(s) has yet to be examined. In this study, we investigated the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the entry and intracellular trafficking of KSHV and one of its cognate receptors, integrin b1. We detailed the requirements for proteasome function and de novo ubiquitination for efficient viral entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to the perinuclear regions. Inhibition of proteasome function by several chemicals reduced viral entry and intracellular trafficking, and caused an accumulation of viral particles in an early endosomal compartment. As a result, KSHV infectivity was reduced.",

MG132 is a peptide aldehyde that potently inhibits the transition state of the proteasome [19] . EPOX selectively and irreversibly binds to the catalytic b subunits of the proteasome and effectively inhibits multiple proteolytic activities [20] . At 4 hr post-infection (hpi), the total numbers of viral particles docked at each nucleus or in a whole cell revealed by staining for small capsid protein Orf65 were quantified. Inhibition of proteasome activity with either MG132 or EPOX had no effect on the total numbers of cell-associated viral particles including those that were associated with plasma membrane ( Figure S1 ), indicating that the proteasome inhibitors do not affect the attachment of viral particles to the cells. However, inhibition of proteasome activity with either MG132 (Figure 1A -B) or EPOX ( Figure 1C -D) resulted in significantly fewer Orf65+ viral particles docked at the nuclear membranes at a dose-dependent fashion compared to cells treated with DMSO alone. Under these experimental conditions, we did not observe any noticeable cytotoxicity of the inhibitors to the cells based on propidium iodide (PI) staining (data not shown). To determine whether proteasome inhibitors actually blocked the infectious pathway of KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking, we stained the cells for the expression of LANA protein (Orf73) for evidence of successful infection. Inhibition of proteasome function significantly reduced the numbers of LANA-positive cells at 48 hpi (Figure 2A and B) . At the highest used doses of MG132 (96 mg/ml) and EPOX (500 nM), LANA-positive cells were reduced from 96.86% of the untreated cells to 0% and 3.49%, respectively ( Figure 2B ). These results indicate that proteasome activity is necessary for successful KSHV intracellular trafficking to the nuclei.",

In addition to Orf65+ viral particles, cells were stained for either EEA1 (Figure 4 , and Videos S5-S8) or LAMP1 ( Figure 5 , and Videos S9-S12) to identify the early endosomal compartment or the late endosome/lysosomal compartment, respectively.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, an endothelial malignancy commonly found in AIDS patients, and several other malignancies. KSHV enters endothelial cells primarily through clathrinmediated endocytosis. In this study, we show that the proteasome activity is required for KSHV entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to nuclei. Inhibition of proteasome activity reduced KSHV infectivity and led to the accumulation of KSHV particles in EEA1+ early endosomal vesicles. Furthermore, we show that ubiquitination mediates the internalization of both KSHV and one of its receptors integrin b1. KSHV particles are colocalized with ubiquitin-binding proteins epsin and eps15, as well as activated forms of the E3 ligase c-Cbl. Knock-down of c-Cbl or inhibition of its phosphorylation blocked KSHV entry and trafficking, thus preventing KSHV infection of endothelial cells. Together, these results illustrate the essential role of ubiquitination during the internalization of KSHV and its cognate receptor integrin b1. The identification of an E3 ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of KSHV and its cognate receptor integrin b1 leading to viral entry provide a potential therapeutic target for this oncogenic virus.",

To further understand how proteasome inhibition prevents viral entry and intracellular trafficking, we investigated the role of two adaptor molecules that link clathrin-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitination. Epsin and Eps15 are endocytic adaptor proteins that recognize ubiquitinated cargo through their ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) [21, 22] . Binding of Epsin to ubiquitinated EGFR is required for its translocation into clathrin-coated pits [22] . Binding of Eps15 to ubiquitinated Cx43 mediates its internalization through endocytosis [21] . Since KSHV enters HUVEC primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we hypothesized that endocytic adaptor proteins such as Epsin or Eps15 may play an important role during KSHV entry. As shown in Figure 6A , most KSHV particles were colocalized with both Epsin and Eps15 during infection of HUVEC. However, we also observed small numbers of KSHV particles that were not colocalized with the adaptor proteins, possibly reflecting the transient nature of the interaction. The detection of these non-colocalized particles indicates that the observed colocalization is specific but not due to random distribution of the viral particles. These results suggest that KSHV utilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells, and either KSHV or its receptor(s) is subjected to ubiquitination during the viral internalization process.",

To test this, we treated endothelial cells with either MG132 or EPOX for 1 hr, before the inoculation with KSHV. Cells were analyzed for ubiquitin by immunoblots at different times post-treatment. Both polyubiquitinated proteins and free ubiquitin were detected in the DMSO-treated samples regardless of KSHV infection ( Figure 6B -C). The typical smear of higher molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins was visible in all lysates tested, though there was an obvious increase in the amount of ubiquitination in the samples treated with proteasome inhibitors.

Indeed, inhibition of E1 activating enzyme and ubiquitination reduced the number of viral particles that successfully entered the cells and trafficked to the nuclei ( Figure 7E -F). However, UBEI-41 had no detectable effect on the total numbers of viral particles per cell including those that were associated with plasma membrane ( Figure S1 ).

E3 ligases contain the substrate recognition motifs that provide the target specificity for ubiquitination. Approximately 1,000 E3 ligases have been identified in humans. Among them, Rabex5 is an E3 ligase involved in endocytosis and endosomal maturation by specifically targeting Rab5-positive early endosomes [31, 32] while the E3 ligase c-Cbl ubiquitinates integrin complexes [33] . c-Cbl is activated through phosphorylation by the Src family kinases principally at tyrosine residues 700, 731, and 774 [34] [35] [36] . Thus, Rabex-5 and c-Cbl are candidate E3 ligases that may potentially mediate KSHV internalization. We therefore sought to investigate the roles Rabex-5 and c-Cbl in KSHV entry into endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 8A -B and Figure S3 , only a minimal amount of KSHV particles (6%) were colocalized with Rabex5 during KSHV infection. In contrast, a significant fraction of KSHV particles (70%) were colocalized with c-Cbl. Furthermore, KSHV particles were also colocalized with two activated phosphorylated forms of c-Cbl, at 40% with phosphotyrosine 700, and at 25% with phospho-tyrosine 774.",

Knock-down of c-Cbl significantly reduced the number of KSHV particles that successfully entered the cells and trafficked to the nuclei ( Figure 9A -C). In contract to c-Cbl, knock-down of Rabex-5 had no effect on KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking ( Figure 9A -C). Consistent with these results, knock-down of c-Cbl but not Rabex-5 almost completely abolished KSHV infectivity as shown by the numbers of LANA-positive cells at 48 hpi ( Figure 9D and Figure S4 ). c-Cbl is activated through phosphorylation by the Src family kinases, and Src activity can be blocked by chemical analogs of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) [37] , which inhibits the E3 ligase activity of c-Cbl [38] . As expected, treatment of HUVEC with increasing doses of PP1 analog inhibited viral entry and intracellular trafficking, resulting in significantly fewer KSHV particles reaching the nuclei ( Figure 10A-B) . Under these experimental conditions, we did not observe any cytotoxicity to the cells based on PI staining (data not shown). To verify that PP1 treatment prevents c-Cbl phosphorylation, immunoblot analysis on HUVEC lysates collected following treatment with PP1 was performed ( Figure 10C ). Exposure of cells to either 100 ng/ml EGF or KSHV increased c-Cbl phosphorylation at tyrosines 700 and 774; however these phosphorylation modifications were abrogated in the presence of PP1 analog.

            "text": "Our results clearly demonstrate the essential roles for both ubiquitination and proteasome functions during KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking in endothelial cells. Although it is the first time shown for KSHV infection, the ubiquitin/proteasome system is known to regulate either entry or gene expression of several other viruses, including equine infectious anemia virus [39] , influenza virus [40, 41] herpes simplex 1 [42] , murine coronavirus [43] , and vaccinia virus [44] . We have found that the total numbers of KSHV particles reaching nuclei were significantly reduced upon suppression of proteasome function, suggesting that virus entry and intracellular trafficking was arrested at a step prior to docking at nuclei. Consistent with these results, we found that proteasome inhibitors reduced KSHV infectivity indicating that they indeed affected the KSHV infectious pathway. Threedimensional analysis of infected cells revealed that inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in a modest increase in viral particles retained at the plasma membrane, and a significant accumulation of viral particles in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, cells treated with proteasome inhibitors had increased numbers of viral particles retained in the EEA1+ early endosomal compartments. Cells treated with proteasome inhibitors had higher numbers of EEA1+ particles at the membrane, and higher numbers of EEA1+ particles in the cytoplasm as compared to cells treated with DMSO. In contrast, proteasome inhibition reduced the total number of KSHV particles in the LAMP1+ late endosome/ lysosome compartments. Lower numbers of LAMP1+ particles were observed both in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions. These results are in agreement with the study conducted with influenza virus, which showed that proteasome activity is required for progress from the early to late endosomes during its entry of cells [40] . While the proteasome system is required for the entry and intracellular trafficking of several viruses [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , the mechanism that mediates this process remains unclear. One of the primary functions of proteasome is degradation of proteins, an intracellular event. For viruses that enter cells via endocytosis, the entry process is initiated by the attachment of infectious virions to the cellular receptors at the surface of the cell followed by internalization of viral particles and receptors. How proteasome function affects the internalization and intracellular trafficking of virions from outside the cell to the nuclei is not immediately obvious. However, it is known that internalization of EGFR and other membrane receptors requires the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail. Following ubiquitination, endocytic adaptor proteins Epsin and Eps15 will recognize the ubiquitinated region of EGFR and facilitate its movement into the clathrin-coated pits. Since KSHV enters cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [12, 13] , we hypothesized that Epsin and or Eps15 are involved in the entry process. Indeed, 3-D colocalization analysis revealed that both Epsin and Eps15 are associated with KSHV particles, suggesting that either the viral particles or their receptors are ubiquitinated. In addition, when proteasome function is inhibited, the level of free ubiquitin is greatly diminished, which may explain how virus internalization and intracellular trafficking are suppressed in this context. Viral particles require cellular structures and processes to enter cells, and specific membrane-bound receptors to facilitate their attachment, internalization, and trafficking through the intracellular space to the final destination. KSHV has evolved to use members of the integrin family, mainly integrin a3b1 and integrin avb3 as its receptors [15, 16] . Integrins are heterodimers composed of a and b subunits. We observed a high percentage of colocalization of KSHV particles with integrin b1. Integrin b1 is targeted for ubiquitination following inoculation with KSHV, which is prevented by treatment with an inhibitor of the E1 activating enzyme. In addition, live-labeling of cells with antibody against integrin b1 revealed that when ubiquitination is prevented, integrin b1 is retained at the plasma membrane. Finally, entry and intracellular trafficking of KSHV was greatly reduced in endothelial cells treated with the inhibitor of E1 activating enzyme, UBEI-41, in a dose-dependent manner, proving that ubiquitination itself directly mediates viral entry and trafficking. Together these results indicate that inhibition of proteasome function causes an arrest at an early stage of KSHV entry into cells, which is supported by the observations of increased numbers of viral particles at the membrane and cytoplasm, and increased colocalization of viral particles with EEA1. These results suggest that ubiquitination may be required for the initial steps of internalization from the plasma membrane and maturation of the early endosome. In fact, ubiquitination may be required at multiple steps of the entry process, from the formation of the clathrin-coated pits and internalization, to endosomal maturation, and finally docking at the nuclear membrane. Further studies should delineate the possible roles for ubiquitination during postearly endosome stages.",

            "text": "We have examined E3 ligases that may mediate KSHV internalization and maturation of KSHV-containing endosomes. EEA1 is a docking/tethering protein that binds to membranes containing Rab5 GTPase, thus effecting endosomal fusion and maturation [45] [46] [47] . Rab5 activation effected by GDP to GTP conversion is regulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabex-5. Rabex-5 is autoubiquitinated [48] , and is also an E3 ligase with a N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain that mediates cargo targeting to the early endosomal membrane [31, 49] . The fact that we have observed an accumulation of viral particles in an EEA1+ early endosomal compartment in conditions when ubiquitin is unavailable, as well as colocalization of viral particles with Rabex-5 is intriguing. Although the level of or EPOX (C) were incubated with KSHV for 4 hr, stained for viral particles (red), cell membrane (white) and nuclei (blue). Z-stack images were acquired with confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Three-dimensional software was used to generate z-projection images (left column). Threedimensional contoured images (middle and right columns) were generated using Imaris image analysis software to determine the localizations of KSHV particles in relation to the cell membrane, the cell interior, and the cell nucleus (upper panels). The 3-D images in the upper panels were rotated on the x-axis to visualize viral particles attached at the cell membrane (small green arrows), internalized into the cytoplasmic space (orange triangles), or docked at the nucleus (green triangles) (lower panels). Videos S1, S2, and S3 correspond to Figures 3A, B, HUVEC treated with DMSO, MG132 or EPOX were incubated with KSHV for 4 hr, stained for KSHV particles (red), LAMP1 (green), membrane (white), and nuclei (blue). Z-stacks were deconvolved and, Imaris image analysis software was used to generate 3-D contoured images. Videos S9, S10 and S11 correspond to cells treated with DMSO, MG132 or EPOX, respectively, labeled for KSHV particles and LAMP1 rotated around the x-axis. Video S12 depicts KSHV particles enclosed in an LAMP1+ vesicle. (B-D) Imaris 3-D colocalization analyses determine the total numbers of KSHV particles in a cell that are colocalized with LAMP1 (B), the numbers of viral particles localized at cell membranes that are LAMP1+ (C), and the numbers of viral particles localized within the cytoplasmic spaces that are LAMP1+ (D). Box and whisker plots depict the statistical analyses of the cellular localization of KSHV particles as described in Figure 3 . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002703.g005 colocalization was minimal (6% of KSHV particles), the infection was unsynchronized, and the assay was performed at a single time point, at 4 hpi. However, we did observe substantial colocalization with the E3 ligase c-Cbl, and more specifically, we observed colocalization with the activated phosphorylated forms of c-Cbl, phospho-Y700 and phospho-Y774. Consistent with these results, knock-down of c-Cbl significantly inhibited viral entry and intracellular trafficking, and prevented KSHV infection of the endothelial cells. Furthermore, when c-Cbl activation was prevented by inhibition of Src, KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking was dramatically reduced. Immunoblot analysis con-firmed that Src inhibition did in fact prevent phosphorylation of c-Cbl at tyrosine residues 700 and 774 during KSHV infection. These results are in agreement with a recent study that demonstrated the important role of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation for KSHV entry into human dermal microvascular endothelial cells via the macropinocytic pathway [50] . The same group also investigated the ubiquitination of myosin IIA during KSHV infection, and found that c-Cbl may be mediating the formation of membrane blebs through its E3 ligase activity. However, our results have demonstrated the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system during clathrin-mediated KSHV endocytic entry into following KSHV infection, which is blocked by UBEI-41. HUVEC pretreated with DMSO or UBEI-41 for 1 hr were infected with KSHV. At 1 hpi, integrin b1 was immunoprecipitated and the ubiquitinated protein detected by Western-blotting. (C and D) Ubiquitination mediates internalization of integrin b1. HUVEC pretreated with DMSO (C) or UBEI-41 (D) for 1 hr were labeled with a monoclonal antibody to integrin b1 for 1 hr, fixed and labeled with an AlexaFluor488 goat anti-mouse antibody. Z-stack images were acquired to visualize the cellular location of the labeled integrin b1. (E) Inhibition of E1 activating enzyme reduces KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking in endothelial cells. HUVEC were pretreated for 1 hr with UBEI-41 before infection with KSHV for 4 hr, and stained for viral particles (red) and nuclei (blue). (F) Quantification of the numbers of KSHV particles docked at nuclei following inhibition with UBEI-41 as described in E. endothelial cells. We have independently identified c-Cbl as a mediator of KSHV entry into endothelial cells, confirming its essential roles as both an adaptor molecule and as an E3 ligase in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Nevertheless, it remains possible that ubiquitination and other E3 ligases are involved at later stages of endosomal maturation. Mammalian cells express hundreds of E3 ligases. The functions of most of these other ligases have not been well-studied. The identification of an E3 ligase that specifically mediates ubiquitination leading to viral entry could certainly provide a potential therapeutic target. Figure 9 . Knock-down of c-Cbl but not Rabex-5 inhibits KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking, and prevents KSHV infection of endothelial cells. (A) HUVEC mock-treated or infected with c-Cbl, Rabex-5 or control shRNA lentivirus particles for 4 days were examined for the expression of c-Cbl, Rabex-5 and b-tubulin by Western-blotting. (B) HUVEC grown on coverslips were mock treated or infected with c-Cbl, Rabex-5 or control lentivirus particles for 4 days, and infected by KSHV for 4 hr. Cells were stained for Orf65+ viral particles (red) and nuclei (blue). Knock-down with c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of KSHV particles successfully docked at perinuclear regions. (C) Analyses of numbers of KSHV particles docked on each nucleus following shRNA lentivirus infection depicted as box and whisker plots as described in Figure 3 . (D) Quantification of LANA-positive cells following KSHV infection for 48 hr in cells with prior knock-down with c-Cbl, Rabex-5, or control shRNA ( Figure S4 ). HUVEC grown on coverslips were mock treated or infected with lentivirus particles for 4 days, and infected by KSHV. At 48 hpi, cells were stained for LANA (red) and nuclei (blue). LANA-positive cells were analyzed and depicted as box and whisker plots as described in Figure 2B . c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of LANA-positive cells. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002703.g009 ",

Lysates were sonicated at 25% efficiency for 3 times, each for 5 sec, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g at 4uC. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein G beads for 1 hr and incubated with mouse anti-integrin b1 for 2 hr at 4uC. The protein G beads were used to precipitate the immune complexes overnight 4uC with rotation, and the immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotting to detect ubiquitin.",

Data were analyzed using t-test, analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests where appropriate, with p,0.05 considered as significant using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Cells bearing a minimum of five viral particles per cell were included in the analysis. The distributions of viral particle localization are summarized in box and whisker plots to represent the median values (middle lines), the 75th and 25th percentiles (opened boxes), and the 90th and 10th percentiles (short lines). Outliers outside the 90th and 10th percentiles are represented as black dots. Figure S1 Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and EPOX, and E1 ligase inhibitor UBEI-41 do not affect the numbers of cell-associated KSHV particles per cell. HUVEC treated with DMSO, MG132, EPOX or UBEI-41 were inoculated with KSHV for 4 hr, and examined for total numbers of cell-associated viral particles. Box and whisker plots depict the statistical analyses of the cellular localization of KSHV particles as described in Figure 3 . p-values ,0.05 are statistically significant. (TIF) Figure S2 Minimal colocalization of integrin b1 with RRV, transferrin and cholera toxin B. To detect RRV colocalization with integrin b1, cells infected with RRV-RFP for 4 hr were stained for RRV particles (red), integrin b1 (green) and nuclei (blue). To detect colocalization or transferrin or cholera toxin B with integrin b1, cells incubated with AlexaFluor 647transferrin (red) or AlexaFluor 647-cholera toxin B (red) for 1 hr were stained for integrin b1 (green) and nuclei (blue). Images were subjected to colocalization analysis. (TIF) Figure S3 KSHV particles are colocalized with E3 ligase c-Cbl or its activated phosphorylated forms but, to a less extent, with Rabex5. HUVEC infected with KSHV for 4 hr were stained for KSHV particles (red), E3 ligase Rabex5 (green), c-Cbl or its phosphorylated forms (pY700 or pY774) (green), and cell nuclei (blue). Z-stack images were acquired and used for colocalization analysis. (TIF) Figure S4 Knock-down of c-Cbl but not Rabex-5 prevents KSHV infection of endothelial cells. HUVEC grown on coverslips were mock treated or infected with c-Cbl, Rabex-5 or control lentivirus particles for 4 days, and infected with KSHV. Cells were fixed and stained for LANA (red) and nuclei (blue) at 48 hpi. The results were analyzed and presented in Figure 9D . c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of LANA-positive cells.",
