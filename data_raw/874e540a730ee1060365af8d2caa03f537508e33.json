The requirement for the virus to be manipulated in a biosafety level three (BSL-3) facility has impeded development of urgently-needed antiviral agents. Here, we established anovel mouse model by inserting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) into the Rosa26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in global expression of the transgene in a genetically stable mouse line. The mice were highly susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV clinical strain hCoV-EMC, which induced severe diffuse pulmonary disease in the animals, and could also be infected by an optimized pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Administration of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, H111-1 and m336, as well as a fusion inhibitor peptide, HR2P-M2, protected mice from challenge with authentic and pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These results confirmed that the hDPP4-knockin mouse is a novel model for studies of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and anti-MERS-CoV antiviral agents in BSL-3 and BSL-2facilities, respectively.",

The classification of MERS-CoV as a biosafety level three (BSL-3) agent is an additional hurdle to progress in this area. Since the emergence of MERS-CoV, several animal species have been evaluated as potential models, including wild-type mice, mice deficient in innate immunity [3], Syrian hamsters [4], ferrets [5] and non-human primates (NHPs) [4, 6] . Two NHPs (rhesus macaques and marmosets) were found to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, but other species including mice are naturally non-permissive to infection. Although human DPP4 (hDPP4) has been identified as the receptor for MERS-CoV [7] that mediates infection, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) is not functional in this respect [8] . Mice adenovirally transduced with hDPP4 could be transiently infected by MERS-CoV but did not develop fatal MERS disease [9] .Moreover, hDPP4-transgenic (Tg) mice expressing hDPP4 under the control of either the cytokeratin 18 promoter [10] or a ubiquitous promoter [11] were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and developed fatal disease, but also developed unrelated lethal encephalitis. Two knock-in (KI) mice in which mDPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 using CRISPR/Cas9 [8, 12] could be infected by high-titer MERS-CoV isolates but were more susceptible to mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains. Since mDPP4 is central to normal glucose homeostasis [13] and plays an important role in immunity [14] , altering its sequence may disrupt these functions.",

The tdTomato gene was inserted downstream of hDPP4 with an internal ribosome entry site allowing co-expression of tdTomato and hDPP4. A poly(A) sequence and a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) were added to enhance mRNA stability and translation efficiency ( Figure 1A ). The targeting vector along with subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 mRNA were injected into zygotes of C57BL/6 mice. Successful insertion in nine of 41 offspring was positively confirmed by Southern blotting and the results for five mice are presented in Figure 1B . One male founder and one female founder died before weaning and two founders were too emaciated to mate. Five founders were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice, and two matings produced F1-positive offspring. Tail tips of F1-positive mice were subjected to PCR genotyping ( Figure 1C ) and Southern blotting to confirm correct insertion of hDPP4. Homozygous mice were termed B6-Gt (Rosa) 26 Sortm1 (SA-hDPP4-tdTomato), abbreviated to R26-hDPP4. Significant hDPP4 expression could be detected by RT-PCR in all R26-hDPP4 mouse tissues tested ( Figure 1D ), but no expression was detected in wild-type mice. Western blotting of lung and brain tissues confirmed hDPP4 expression ( Figure 1E ). Unlike Tg mice, which showed the highest-level expression of hDPP4 in heart and brain [11] , R26-hDPP4 mice had the highest hDPP4 expression in lung. Profiting from the insertion of tdTomato downstream of hDPP4, the global expression patterns of hDPP4 were examined visually ( Figure 1F ) via bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Since the liver, intestine and lung have bigger volumes, they have brighter images than other organs. For the R26 probe, genomic DNA was digested with SpeI, and the expected sizes of wild-type and gene-targeted bands were 8.9 kb and 14.2 kb, respectively. For the WPRE probe, genomic DNA was digested with BglII, and the expected size of the gene-targeted band was 5.1 kb. Four representative results are shown. (C) PCR genotyping of R26-hDPP4 mice. The primer pair was designed to anneal in the coding region of hDPP4, and the expected PCR amplicon was 628 bp in length. (D) Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) of hDPP4 mRNA in R26-hDPP4 mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Values are presented as means \u00b1 SEMs of three independent experiments and were normalized to GAPDH levels. No expression of R26-hDPP4 in wild-type mice was detected. (E) Detection of DPP4 protein by western blotting in brain and lung. Weaker blotting signal was detected in wild-type mice, indicating the anti-hDPP4 antibody could recognize mDPP4. (F) Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of newborn R26-hDPP4-knockin mice showing hDPP4 expression in their organs. The imaged organs were: (1) thymus, (2) liver, (3) stomach, (4) kidney, (5) intestine, (6) spleen, (7) heart, (8) lung, (9) and (10) the whole bodies of wild-type mice and R26-hDPP4 mice, respectively.",

Two mice (2/4) had lost more than 30% of their body weights by day 4 p.i. Viral titers in the lungs of R26-hDPP4 mice were measured as approximately 10 3 PFU sat 5 days p.i. while no virus was detected in the lungs of wild-type mice ( Figure 2B ; mean difference 2.958 log PFUs, 95% CI 1.266-4.699 log PFUs).

[2] reported a MERS-CoV pseudovirus that allowed for single-round infection of several cell lines expressing hDPP4. However, despite using several proven methods [22] , we at first failed to infect R26-hDPP4 mice, which were otherwise permissive to infection by authentic virus, using pseudotyped virus. At first, we attributed this failure to low pseudovirus titer and therefore we optimized the parameters of pseudovirus production (Supplementary Figure S2A-D) . Finally, pseudovirus with titers up to 1.27 \u00d7 10 7.5 TCID 50 /mL (Supplementary Figure S2E ) was obtained. The pseudovirus was then titrated in 4-week-old R26-hDPP4 mice, and the 50% animal infectious dose (AID 50 ) was determined to be 10 TCID 50 /mL viatheintrathoracic (I.T.) route.",

Mice were anaesthetized and observed with a BLI system at various days p.i. Bioluminescence of the transgene-encoded Fluc reporter was first observed at day 2 p.i. in the abdomen, close to the injection site ( Figure 4A ). The bioluminescence then spread to the thoracic cavity by day 6 p.i. Bioluminescence reached peak intensity and then gradually weakened up to day 20 p.i. (Figure 4B ). To identify the sites of infection, mice were dissected and their organs were observed on the day of peak infection. Figure 4C showed that thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and muscle, among other organs and tissues, were infected by pseudovirus. Higher pseudoviruscopy numbers were detected in these organs ( Figure 4D ), illustrating that R26-hDPP4 mice could be efficiently infected by pseudovirus. Since MERS-CoV infection mainly causes clinical ARDS [37, 38] , the primary site of infection should be the respiratory tract. Therefore, to maximize infection in the respiratory tract, we infected mice via the I.T. route. Live-animal imaging showed that infection was mainly localized to the chest, with maximal infection occurring on days 10 and 11 p.i. Using the I.T. route, the major infected organs were the thymus, heart and lung ( Figure 3C) . A uniform infection profile was observed in all mice, indicating that I.T. challenge had some advantages over I.P. challenge. I.N. and I.V. challenge were also attempted but did not result in productive infection. To test the influence of the animals' age on susceptibility to infection, 4-to 9-week-old mice were inoculated with pseudovirus. Both younger and older mice could be infected, but younger mice were more susceptible ( Figure 4E,F) . As reported previously [30] , fluorescence intensity and virus copy number in tissues were strongly correlated, suggesting that fluorescence intensity could be used as an indicator of pseudovirus infection. Pseudovirus infection caused no histopathological changes, indicating that this tool was safe in mice ( Figure 4G) . Notably, through BLI visualization and confirmation by IHC, we found that pseudovirus tended to infect bronchi ( Figure 4H ), a tropism shared with authentic virus ( Figure 2E ). caused no histopathological changes, indicating that this tool was safe in mice ( Figure 4G) .

Therefore, an animal model of MERS-CoV disease that recapitulates the pathological characteristics in both respiratory tract and CNS, supports high-level virus replication in vivo, and exhibits lung pathology associated with ARDS is required. Moreover, the animal model must be economical, genetically stable, and show reproducible results [8] . Mouse-adapted viral strains have been widely used to establish infection models. Wherever possible, clinical isolates should be used in challenge experiments (http://www.gryphonscientific.com/gain-of-function/) [12] . Targeting transgenes to specific sites of the mouse genome has many advantages over the random insertion typically used in transgenic methods. Two hDPP4-KI mice created by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing were recently reported [8, 12] . In these mice, mDPP4 gene was either replaced by hDPP4 or mutated and its function was disrupted.",

Notably, the R26-hDPP4 mouse displayed an unusual expression profile, in which transgenic hDPP4 was stably and highly expressed in lung and also expressed to a lesser extent in brain and other organs ( Figure 1D-F) . We reasoned that this expression pattern might support robust infection and lesions in lung and brain, both using pseudotyped and authentic MERS-CoV. We further reasoned that insertion ofhDPP4 into the safe harbor of the Rosa26 locus and conserving mDPP4 function would be an appropriate strategy for establishing a genetically stable animal model.

Infected R26-hDPP4 mice experienced significant loss of body weight, up to 33.6%, which was comparable to that observed in mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain [21] . Higher viral titers than in previous reports [8] were detected in lungs and were accompanied by diffuse pathogenesis including widened alveolar septa, vascular dilatation and hyperemia, perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells, necrosis of bronchial epithelial cells, edema and hyaline membrane formation (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1 ). The pathophysiological findings were closely associated with clinical manifestations [45] . All infected R26-hDPP4mice had uniform disease symptoms with a significant difference observed between KI and wild-type mice, as revealed by quantitative pathological scores (Figure 2 ). Very few reports have described the sites of MERS-CoV infection in patients, even though these data are crucial for understanding viral pathogenesis. For both cultural and religious reasons, no tissue samples have been made available [37] . However, studies using several animal models has been helpful in addressing this problem. In rhesus macaques, transient lower respiratory tract infection was accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration [4] . By contrast, severe interstitial pneumonia within filtration and alveolar edema were observed in infected marmosets [6] . Research using small animal models, such as a mouse transduced with an Ad5 vector expressing hDPP4 [9] , a Tg mouse model [11] , and KI mice created with CRISPR/Cas9 technology [8, 12] ,provide uncontested evidence that the respiratory system is the main site of MERS-CoV infection, in agreement with most clinical manifestations [37] . In this study, we also showed that the lungs, especially the bronchi, were the primary sites of infection both for pseudotyped and authentic virus (Figures 2-5; Table S1 ).",

[11] reported high viral loads in the brain, but no necrosis or inflammatory reactions were observed. In KI mice infected with a mouse-adapted viral strain, no viral replication was detected in brain, even at challenge doses of 5 \u00d7 10 6 PFUs. This animal model was heralded as having the advantage of mimicking the clinical manifestations of ARDS in the absence of CNS complications. However, even though respiratory infection and ARDS are common clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, patients with severe neurological syndrome, including confusion, coma and ataxia as well as focal motor deficit, have been reported [40] . Here, when R26-hDDP4 mice were infected with the clinical strain hCoV-EMC at a dose of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 PFUs, viral loads were detected using IHC assays (Figure 2 ) in the cerebellum, cerebral ganglia and cerebrum. In association with these viral loads, perivascular gliosis, an indicator of inflammatory reactions, was observed in these organs in all 12 R26-hDPP4mice irrespective of mAb administration or mAb ablation of inflammation ( Figure 3 ). These phenomena were not observed in any wild-type mice challenged in the same manner. Since virus was mainly detected on the membranes of motor neurons, we reasoned that the dyskinesia observed in patients would also be manifested in mice. Additional studies to assess the possible nerve infection are being conducted, and viral loads in nervous system are considered to be titrated.",

Pseudovirus cell models are popularly applied since they are relatively easy to develop; however, pseudovirus animal models are not as widely available, even though they have more extensive potential applications. Pseudovirus animal models may be difficult to achieve due to lack of susceptibility and the absence of suitably infectious pseudoviruses. Previously, an inhibition assay based on the pseudovirus cell model was established and used to detect neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV [2] . However, these pseudoviruses failed to infect the R26-hDPP4 mouse, which was shown to be particularly susceptible to authentic virus. We presumed that this effect might be caused by low pseudovirus titer. Therefore, the codons of the S protein, backbone plasmid [22] , and production conditions were optimized systematically, resulting in an increase in titer of about 1000-fold (Supplementary Figure S2) and finally resulting in the successful infection of R26-hDPP4 mice.",

We tried to infect R26-hDPP4-KI mice with pseudovirus by the I.N. route but this was unsuccessful. This failure might have resulted from the use of less than 50 \u00b5L of pseudovirus inoculum for nasal dripping; this dosage may not have been sufficient for a single round of infection. We found that different infection routes might result in different biodistribution. Pseudovirus was detected by BLI in the thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, muscle and intestine of mice infected via the I.P. route. However, for challenge via the I.T. route, pseudovirus was only observed in the thymus, heart and lung. Thus, the route of infection also had some effect on pseudovirus distribution. For example, viral loads might fail to be detected in the lungs of mice with minor I.P. infections. However, the I.T. route resulted in uniform infection patterns in the lungs, and especially in the bronchi (Figures 4 and 5) . The pseudovirus distribution pattern (Figure 4 ) was similar to that of Tg mice infected with authentic virus [11] . Mice as old as 9 weeks could be infected, but younger mice (i.e., those 4 to 5 weeks old) had better susceptibility. The pseudovirus infection caused no pathological lesions in multiple organs, indicating that this model was safe (Figure 4) .",

As expected, m336 and H111-1 both showed outstanding inhibitory activity in the pseudovirus cell model (IC 50 = 4.5 ng/mL) and pseudovirus mouse model. Moreover, mAb H111-1 was also effective in protecting R26-hDPP4 mice from authentic virus infection. The protective effects of a well-characterized peptide inhibitor, HR2P-M2 [26] , were assessed in the pseudovirus model with results similar to those described above. Overall, this pseudovirus mouse model showed outcomes that were consistent with those of the authentic virus mouse model, and the R26-hDPP4-KI mouse is, therefore, a unique animal model for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines in biological laboratories lacking BSL-3 facilities.",

To allay these doubts, a combination analysis was deemed necessary in this study. As shown in Figure 5 , the relevance of the pseudotyped and authentic virus models was demonstrated. We showed that the manifestations of infection in the lung, the main target of MERS-CoV infection, were very similar between the authentic and pseudovirus models and that in both cases infection was localized to the epithelial cells of the bronchi. A dose conversion between pseudotyped virus and authentic virus was calculated, indicating that this pseudovirus mouse model is reliable and can be used to evaluate the effects of antiviral agents. However, pseudovirus represents a single-cycle infection and without replication in vivo, it does not cause pathological changes. Authentic MERS-CoV infection model is a better choice when studying disease pathogenesis.",
