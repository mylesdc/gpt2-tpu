            "text": "Background: Heparin and heparin-related sulphated carbohydrates inhibit ligand binding of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Here, we have studied the ability of heparin to inhibit homophilic interactions of RAGE in living cells and studied how heparin related structures interfere with RAGE-ligand interactions. Methods: Homophilic interactions of RAGE were studied with bead aggregation and living cell protein-fragment complementation assays. Ligand binding was analyzed with microwell binding and chromatographic assays. Cell surface advanced glycation end product binding to RAGE was studied using PC3 cell adhesion assay. Results: Homophilic binding of RAGE was mediated by V 1 -and modulated by C 2 -domain in bead aggregation assay. Dimerisation of RAGE on the living cell surface was inhibited by heparin. Sulphated K5 carbohydrate fragments inhibited RAGE binding to amyloid \u03b2-peptide and HMGB1. The inhibition was dependent on the level of sulfation and the length of the carbohydrate backbone. \u03b1-D-Glucopyranosiduronic acid (glycyrrhizin) inhibited RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products in PC3 cell adhesion and protein binding assays. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box binding to heparin. Conclusions: Our results show that K5 polysaccharides and glycyrrhizin are promising candidates for RAGE targeting drug development.",

Ligand induced receptor dimerisation and oligomerisation is required for strong RAGE signaling [6, 7] .",

It is a well-tolerated drug in humans and it has well-documented hepatoprotective effects in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C infections [8] [9] [10] [11] . Intravenous glycyrrhizin downregulates serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels and reduces the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, glycyrrhizin has numerous other protective pharmacological functions, like anti-ulcer and anti-allergic effects (reviewed in the literature [12, 13] ). Glycyrrhizin has anti-viral effects in vitro and it dampens inflammatory reactions in various animal models [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin are at least partly due to its ability to downregulate proinflammatory cytokine expression and inhibit leukocyte diapedesis. Glycyrrhizin and heparin have D-glucuronic acid units in their structure and they both are potent inhibitors of transendothelial migration of leukocytes [20] . However, in heparin, D-glucuronic acid units are mostly C5-epimerised to L-iduronic acid and are highly sulphated. Glycyrrhizin can be chemically sulphated, which potentiates its anti-viral effects [21, 22] .",

RAGE independent migration of cells can occur via HMGB1-stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) heterocomplex mediated pathway [28] . SDF-1 signals through C-X-C chemokine type receptor 4 (CXCR4). In addition, SDF-1 binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) type cell surface receptors is a prerequisite to it promoting activity of tissue emigration of cells [30] . Further, the importance of HMGB1 in cell migration in vivo was shown in the study by Oyama and others, where decreased leukocyte diapedesis occurred in HMGB1 heterozygote mice [31] . It has been unclear whether interactions of HMGB1 with HSPGs, which mediate cell adhesion and migration, can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin.",

In addition, glycyrrhizin interferes HMGB1 binding to CXCR4, Toll-like receptor 2, and Toll-like receptor 4 [25, 28, 38] . Glycyrrhizin might be a potential molecule for RAGE targeting drug development because it can be easily modified [21, 22] .

In a microwell binding assay, 300 \u00b5M glycyrrhizin inhibited RAGE binding to AGE-BSA coated microwells (Figure 4) . The effect of glycyrrhizin on RAGE-AGE interactions was also tested in cell adhesion assay. PC3 cells express endogenously synthetized AGEs on their surface, which mediate cell binding to RAGE [40, 48, 49] . PC3 cells adhered to RAGE V 1 -domain, but not to C 1 -or C 2 -domains ( [40] ; data not shown). Glycyrrhizin at 1 mM concentration inhibited PC3 cell binding to RAGE V 1 -domain, but not to the control proteins fibronectin, laminin, or collagen. Furthermore, heparin inhibited cell binding to both RAGE V 1 -domain and fibronectin, but not to laminin and collagen. In contrast, EDTA inhibited cell binding to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen, but not to RAGE V 1 -domain ( Figure 5 ). The finding that the cell binding to RAGE occurs independently of divalent cations excludes the role of Mac-1 integrin in the binding [45] . Our results indicate that AGE binding to RAGE can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin and heparin ( Figure 3A ). ",

The inhibition is mainly due to binding of glycyrrhizin to HMGB1. However, glycyrrhizin shows minimal binding on RAGE. In addition, glycyrrhizin interferes HMGB1 binding to CXCR4, Toll-like receptor 2, and Toll-like receptor 4 [25, 28, 38] . Glycyrrhizin might be a potential molecule for RAGE targeting drug development because it can be easily modified [21, 22] . Here, we tested whether glycyrrhizin affects homophilic interactions of RAGE in cell culture conditions using the PCA assay. Surprisingly, glycyrrhizin inhibited full-length luciferase activity in cells, that is, it was incompatible with the assay, thereby preventing further studies with glycyrrhizin in the PCA assay (data not shown).",

Next, we studied the effect of glycyrrhizin on heparin binding of full-length HMGB1 and A-box using a heparin-Sepharose precipitation assay. Glycyrrhizin inhibited binding of both the full-length HMGB1 and the A-box ( Figure 6B,C) . These results indicate that the A-box and the full length HMGB1 bind to heparin in a similar manner, and that their binding to heparin is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of glycyrrhizin. It is tempting to speculate that glycyrrhizin might inhibit RAGE signaling via interfering HMGB1-heparan sulphate interactions ( Figure 3B ). glycyrrhizin on HMGB1 heparin binding. First, we tested whether A-box binds to heparin in a similar manner to the full-length HMGB1. The A-box bound to a heparin-Sepharose in column chromatography and was eluted with the same NaCl concentration (~0.7 M) as full-length HMGB1 (data not shown). This suggests that the A-box lacking heparin binding cationic amino acid residues in a linker sequence is still able to bind to heparin.",
