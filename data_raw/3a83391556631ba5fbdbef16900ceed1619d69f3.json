Samples used for the diagnosis and experimental analysis must be completely inactivated, although methods for the inactivation of F. tularensis are limited. In this study, effective methods for the inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 and five other strains were determined by comparisons of colony-forming units between treated and control samples. The results showed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 was denatured by heat treatment (94\u02daC for 3 min and 56\u02daC for 30 min), filtration with a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and the use of various solutions (i.e. >70% ethanol, methanol, acetone, and 4% paraformaldehyde). F. tularensis SCHU P9 remained viable after treatment with 50% ethanol for 1 min, filtration with a 0.45 \u03bcm filter, and treatments with detergents (i.e. 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer, 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4\u02daC for 24 h. Additionally, F. tularensis SCHU P9 suspended in fetal bovine serum in plastic tubes was highly resistant to ultraviolet radiation compared to suspensions in water and chemically defined medium. The methods for inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was applicable to the other five strains of F. tularensis. The data presented in this study could be useful for the establishment of guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOP) to inactivate the contaminated samples in not only F. tularensis but also other bacteria.",

F. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S4 dried on acrylic, glass, polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, silicone rubber, and stainless steel was easily inactivated by exposure to vaporous hydrogen peroxide [29] . While, F. tularensis SCHU S4 dried on wood would be inactivated hardly by bleach, citric acid, 70% ethanol, quaternary Ammonia, and Pine-Sol [30] . Bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with F. tularensis SCHU S4 was completely fixed with 4% PFA for 5 min and 2% PFA for 15 min, whereas treatment with 1% PFA for 24 h failed to inactive infected cells [31] . However, the methods for the inactivation of F. tularensis differed among reports.",

No live bacteria were detected in samples after the treatments with 94\u02daC for 3 min (Fig 7A black bars) , 56\u02daC for 30 min (Fig 7A gray bars) , 0.22 \u03bcm filtration (Fig 7B gray bars) , 50% ethanol for 10 min (Fig 7C black bars) , 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (Fig 7C gray bars) , and UV radiation in deionized water (Fig 7E) and CDM (Fig 7F) . On the other hand, live bacteria were remaining in the suspensions filtered through the 0.45 \u03bcm filter in strain Nevada 14 (0.25 CFU), LVS (0.75 CFU), Kato (40.50 CFU), Kf Water (1.25 CFU). Although differing sensitivities were observed among the strains, bacteria were found to survive after detergent treatment ( Fig 7D) and UV radiation in undiluted FBS (Fig 7G) . Conditions for the inactivation for F. tularensis Discussion F. tularensis is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, highly pathogenic and an intracellular bacterium. Samples infected with F. tularensis must be inactivated completely in a BSL-3 facility before transportation to a laboratory with a lower BSL for analyses of the bacteria and infected cells. The results of the present study showed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 was readily and easily inactivated by heat treatments (94\u02daC for 3 min and 56\u02daC for 30 min), filtration using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and treatments with 70% ethanol, methanol, acetone, 10% neutral buffered formalin and 4% PFA solution. On the other hand, filtration using a 0.45 \u03bcm filter and treatments of detergents could significantly decrease the amount of live F. tularensis SCHU P9 but were insufficient for the complete removal of bacteria. F. tularensis SCHU P9 suspended with undiluted FBS in plastic tubes was resistant to UV radiation but not to deionized water and CDM. The findings of the present study were similar to the common conditions for bacterial inactivation [34] . Here, the actual values of the inactivating condition of F. tularensis are provided in detail.",

As is widely known, many viruses and non-sporulating bacteria are usually inactivated at 50\u02daC-60\u02daC, with the exception of enterococci [40, 41] and thermophilic bacteria. In this study, no bacteria were detected in CDM and undiluted FBS following heat treatment at 56\u02daC from 10 to 30 min (S1 Fig. and Fig  2B) . Moreover, bacterial suspensions in deionized water were quickly inactivated at 56\u02daC within 1 min. Day et al. reported that the time required to reduce the population of F. tularensis LVS by 90% (D10-values) in liquid infant formula, apple juice, mango juice, and orange juice was between 8 and 16 s [42] . In this study, the D10-values for F. tularensis SCHU P9 in CDM, undiluted FBS, and PBS were 40, 40 and 35 s, respectively. Though the efficiency of the inactivation between our findings and previous data seemed to differ, Francisella viability after heat treatment was strongly affected by the solution composition. According to these data, heat treatment at 56\u02daC for 30 min was sufficient to inactivate F. tularensis.",

F. tularensis with a diameter ranging 0.2-0.7 \u03bcm [43] might pass through the membrane filter having average pore sizes of 0.45 and 0.22 \u03bcm and can survive in the filter devices during filtration. In addition, the filter membrane can easily clog if the sample fluid contains abundant aggregated bacteria larger than the pore size of the filter. It is possible that even little pressure can accidentally uncouple the connection between the syringe and the filter.

            "text": "Depending on the wavelength, UV radiation is classified as UVA (315-400 nm), UVB (280-315 nm) or UVC (200-280 nm). UVC radiation can effectively induce mutations and death of bacterial as well as mammal cells [46] . In particular, UV light at 254 nm, which is near the maximum absorbance in DNA [47] , can induce the accumulation of dimers between adjacent thymidine residues in the same DNA strand [33] . Rose et al. reported that F. tularensis LVS and NY98 suspended in distilled water were inactivated by UVC treatment at 4 mJ/cm 2 [48] . We confirmed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 spread onto Eugon chocolate agar was completely inactivated by UV radiation at 6.3 mJ/cm 2 . In addition, bacteria suspended in deionized water and CDM into 1.5 mL tubes and 0.2 mL PCR tube were easily inactivated by UV radiation (Fig 6A) . On the other hand, inactivation of bacterial suspensions in undiluted FBS was very difficult with UV radiation (Fig 6B) , which suggested that UV radiation failed to inhibit bacteria in the solution containing abundant nutrients, including proteins. In Bacillus thuringiensis and B. anthracis spores, effective inactivation by UV radiation was also inhibited under more nutritive germination conditions [49] . It is probable that UV radiation is unable to inactivate bacteria because the solution containing abundant nutrients absorbs the UV light into its compounds [50] [51] [52] .",

The parental strain of F. tularensis SCHU P9 is a virulent strain that was initially isolated by Foshay from an ulcer of American patient in 1941 [53, 54] . The Ohara Research Laboratory (Ohara General Hospital, Fukushima, Japan) obtained strain SCHU from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Hamilton, MT, USA) in 1958 [55] . Afterward, F. tularensis SCHU was attenuated by 373 passages in artificial media over 30 years in Japan [55] . Virulent F. tularensis SCHU P9 was isolated by in vivo passages from attenuated SCHU, as described in a previous report [32] . We believe the methods for inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 described in this study would be applicable to other strains of Francisella because the viabilities of the treated samples of F. tularensis SCHU P9 and the other five strains were similar (Fig 7) .",

We recommend that this study be used as a guide and that each laboratory should validate these procedures in their own laboratory.
