            "text": "Background: Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in inflammation and immune responses, as well as in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection could activate NF-\u03baB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was identified as an NF-\u03baB activator among the structural proteins encoded by PRRSV; however, it remains unclear whether the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) contribute to NF-\u03baB activation. In this study, we identified which Nsps can activate NF-\u03baB and investigated the potential mechanism(s) by which they act. Results: By screening the individual Nsps of PRRSV strain WUH3, Nsp2 exhibited great potential to activate NF-\u03baB in MARC-145 and HeLa cells. Overexpression of Nsp2 induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, Nsp2 also induced NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. Compared with the Nsp2 of the classical PRRSV strain, the Nsp2 of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains that possess a 30 amino acid (aa) deletion in Nsp2 displayed greater NF-\u03baB activation. However, the 30-aa deletion was demonstrated to not be associated with NF-\u03baB activation. Further functional domain analyses revealed that the hypervariable region (HV) of Nsp2 was essential for NF-\u03baB activation. Conclusions: Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multifunctional protein participating in the modulation of host inflammatory response, which suggests an important role of Nsp2 in pathogenesis and disease outcomes.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows, and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs, and continues to be the most economically significant disease in the swine industry [1, 2] . The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 15 kb [3] . The 5' two-thirds of the viral genome is occupied by overlapping open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and 1b, which encode nonstructural polyproteins (Nsp), pp1a and pp1ab, respectively [4, 5] . These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 14 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, and Nsp2 to 12) [6] [7] [8] . In 2006, an atypical PRRS outbreak in China was caused by an emerging highly-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain with a discontinuous deletion of 30-amino acid in the Nsp2 coding region in comparison with classical PRRSV strains [9, 10] . Since then, the HP-PRRSV strain, which caused a more severe pneumonia and higher mortality than the classical PRRSV, has become the dominant strain found in China [11, 12] . The immense genetic variability in the coding region of Nsp2 suggests that Nsp2 may play a limited role in viral replication but likely to play a very important part in modulating virus pathogenesis and the inflammation response in pigs during infection [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

The members of the NF-\u03baB family in mammalian cells include p50/p105 (NF\u03baB1), p65 (RelA), p52/p100 (NF\u03baB2), c-Rel, and RelB. All of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain that is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In most cells, Rel family members form hetero-and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations [21, 22] . Classical NF-\u03baB exists as heterodimers consisting of a 50-kDa subunit (p50) and a 65-kDa subunit (p65) [23] . Under normal physiological conditions, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by its interaction with a member of the inhibitory kappa B (I\u03baB) family. When stimulated with a wide range of proinflammatory stimuli, the I\u03baB proteins are phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degraded in proteasomes [24] . The subunit of NF-\u03baB p65 is then phosphorylated while exposing its nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS), leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA regulatory elements of the target genes involved in various biological functions [6, [21] [22] [23] 25] .",

To investigate the potential mechanism(s) of NF-\u03baB activation by Nsp2, we first examined the I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level in the cytoplasmic extracts using a western blot assay. As shown in Figure 2A , the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein degraded in a dose-dependent manner in Nsp2-transfected cells. To further characterize the mechanism, the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, as well as the total p65 in Nsp2 expression cells were determined. As shown in Figure 2A , the amount of phosphorylated p65 and nuclear p65 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner, while the amount of total p65 was unaltered. To further validate NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation after Nsp2 overexpression, HeLa cells co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-p65 and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-Nsp2 fusion expression constructs were used to monitor the translocation of p65 by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

To further investigate the possible biological impact of Nsp2 on pro-inflammatory molecules, a promoter luciferase reporter assay was used to determine if Nsp2 enhanced NF-\u03baB-regulated target gene expression, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. As shown in Figure 3A , overexpression of Nsp2 enhanced the promoter activities of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES to varying degrees. To further confirm these results, the mRNA expression of these cytokines was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As shown in Figure 3B , gene expression data were consistent with the promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. Interestingly, as a result of treatment with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BAY-117082, Nsp2 exhibited reduced ability to upregulate IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES expression in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These observations suggest that Nsp2 stimulated cytokine expression via the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway.",

It is well known that NF-\u03baB is an important transcription factor for mediating virus-induced inflammatory responses, such as severe lung inflammation and diseases [19, 36] . Thus, we assessed the ability of Nsp2 from different PRRSV strains to activate NF-\u03baB using a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure 4A induce a higher level of NF-\u03baB compared with that of the classical PRRSV strain CH-1a (P < 0.01). Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that the Nsp2 of WUH3 and 07HBEZ possessed the same 30 amino acid discontinuous deletion [37] . Thus, we investigated whether these deletions have any effect on NF-\u03baB activation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed several insertion mutants in Nsp2 expression plasmids based on the Nsp2 of PRRSV strain WUH3, which were denoted as Nsp2(+1), Nsp2(+29), and Nsp2(+1/+29). These mutants were then analysed for their capacities of stimulating NF-\u03baB in HeLa cells. These assays showed that NF-\u03baB activation by these Nsp2 insertion mutants was equivalent to that of the wildtype Nsp2 ( Figure 4B ) (P > 0.05). Additionally, insertions within this region did not result in the loss of the ability to activate NF-\u03baB, suggesting that the 30 amino acids discontinuous deletion in the Nsp2 coding region is not related to NF-\u03baB activation.",

These findings are consistent with our result that show the PL2 domain of PRRSV Nsp2 failed to activate NF-\u03baB when expressed independently; however, the HV region of Nsp2 could activate NF-\u03baB to similar levels as the full-length of Nsp2. This suggested that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multi-functional replicase subunit with different domains involved in different functions in viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the activation of NF-\u03baB has been previously described in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages [31, 32] . However, recent studies have reported that several PRRSV Nsps, including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp11, could function as negative regulators of NF-\u03baB to escape the host innate immune response [14, 40] . Furthermore, studies from our laboratory showed that the N protein of PRRSV could induce NF-\u03baB activation [41] . Taken together, these studies suggest that PRRSV might have developed sophisticated strategies for either activation or inhibition of NF-\u03baB pathway to survive in host cells.
