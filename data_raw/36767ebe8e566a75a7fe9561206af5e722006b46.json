This study compared the efficacy and safety of inosine pranobex versus placebo in subjects with clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness, including subjects with laboratory-confirmed acute respiratory viral infections. Subgroup analyses evaluated the efficacy of inosine pranobex compared to placebo in otherwise healthy (without related ongoing disease) subjects that were less than 50 years of age and healthy subjects that were at least 50 years of age. The effect of body mass index (BMI) was evaluated in subjects less than 50 years of age.",

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to resolution of all influenza-like symptoms present at baseline to none. Safety was evaluated through analysis of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examinations. Results: The difference in time to resolution of all influenza-like symptoms between treatment groups was not statistically significant but showed a faster improvement in subjects in the inosine pranobex group versus those in the placebo group -Hazard Ratio = 1.175; (95 % CI: 0.806-1.714). P-value = 0.324. In the subgroup analysis for subjects less than 50 years of age, statistically significant differences in time to resolution of influenza-like symptoms that favoured the inosine pranobex group over the placebo group were observed in those without related ongoing disease and those who were non-obese (BMI <30 kg/m 2 ). The differences between the inosine pranobex and placebo groups in subjects at least 50 years of age without related ongoing disease and in subjects less than 50 years of age who were obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) were not statistically significant.

Inosine pranobex stimulates a nonspecific immune response that is independent of the specific viral antigen responsible for the ILI. In clinical studies, inosine pranobex has been shown to induce a type 1 T helper cell-type response in mitogen-or antigenactivated cells, and this response initiates T-lymphocyte maturation and differentiation and potentiates induced lymphoproliferative responses (13) (14) (15) . Similarly, the drug modulates T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell cytotoxicity and CD8+ suppressor and CD4 + -helper cell functions and increases the number of immunoglobulin G and complement surface markers (14, 15) . Inosine pranobex also increases cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 production and IL-2 production and upregulates the expression of the IL-2 receptor in vitro [13, 14] . The safety profile of inosine pranobex has been established through clinical trials for several indications and populations [2, [14] [15] [16] . A rapid increase in the number of mononuclear cells after the first dose of inosine pranobex was observed in 75 % of the subjects, and this increase was consistent with clinical observations of rapid resolution of common cold symptoms [15, 17] .",

This phenomenon was observed with split-virus influenza vaccines; a low response to the vaccine was observed in older adults, whereas the vaccine was effective in younger subjects. This low response resulted in increased susceptibility to influenza and associated complications in older adults compared to younger adults who typically benefit from a higher response [20, 21] . Obesity has also been identified as an independent risk factor for increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection; this susceptibility results from diminished CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and lower influenza vaccine antibody levels [19, 22, 23] . Obesity may also increase the risk of pneumonia or other infections by restricting lung volume [24] .

Statistically significant differences were not observed between the inosine pranobex and placebo groups in subjects at least 50 years of age without related ongoing disease or in subjects less than 50 years of age who were obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ). Thus, the efficacy of inosine pranobex was improved in nonobese subjects compared with obese subjects, probably because the immune system in the former is more capable of defending against pathogens and is not negatively affected by obesity-related complications. Older patients have a decreased immune response to pathogens as a result of immunosenescence; therefore, they may take longer to recover from illnesses such as influenza and antiinfluenza drugs may not be as effective. In an additional analysis, in subjects less than 50 years of age, statistically significant differences in time to resolution of influenzalike symptoms to mild or none favoured the inosine pranobex group over the placebo group, thus indicating that the improvement of symptoms was better with inosine pranobex than placebo in this subset of subjects (HR: 1.298; 95 % CI: 1.035, 1.627).",

This difference could be a result of the time necessary for activation of the immune system, as inosine pranobex acts indirectly by stimulating the immune system and does not directly attenuate the symptoms. This result is also consistent with the results observed in a study in healthy volunteers in which inosine pranobex showed immunomodulating properties through an increase in serum levels of interferon-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 from 7 to 10 days [13] .",

Furthermore, the enrolment of subjects with symptoms that have been present for less than 36 h is necessary, as the first 36 h is the period of maximal viral replication and antiviral medication is expected to have the most benefit during this time. The current study was anticipated to be performed in 1 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere, between 01 October 2014 and 30 April 2015, and enrol the required number of subjects in each group during this timeframe. However, enrolment was challenging, as it could not be commenced because of a low attack rate and was only started after a late alert was issued by national public health authorities in the first week of December 2014 regarding the statistically higher incidence of acute respiratory viral infections. A low density of circulating viruses was present until the end of January 2015, which resulted in the enrolment of subjects until 30 April 2015 in order to maximize the number of completed subjects. Approximately 60 % of the randomised subjects were expected to have a positive laboratory confirmation of acute respiratory tract infection. However, only 137 subjects met the criteria for inclusion in the mITT analysis set, which was 121 subjects fewer than the 258 subjects expected. The effects of the absence of a significant influenza outbreak adversely affected the statistical power, thus reducing the power of the study, which could potentially explain the lack of statistical significance for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.",
