However, no effective anti-MERS-CoV drug is currently available. Recently, numerous evolutionary studies have suggested that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronavirus (BatCoV). We herein reported that three peptides derived from the HR2 region in spike protein of BatCoV HKU4, including HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, could bind the MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) with high stability. Moreover, these peptides, particularly HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection, suggesting that these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be candidates for futher development as antiviral agents against MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Viruses 2019, 11, 56 2 of 12 displays its spike protein (S), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, on its enveloped membrane surface in a trimer state. S protein contains two subunits: S1 subunit (S1) and S2 subunit (S2). S1 recognizes and binds the cellular receptor, while S2 mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion. The interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 and the receptor (DPP4) on the host cell surface induces S2 structural changes, including the insertion of N-terminal fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, the formation of a homotrimer by heptad repeat 1 (HR1) helices, exposing three hydrophobic grooves on the surface, and the binding of three heptad repeat 2 (HR2) molecules to the hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), which brings the viral and cell membranes close together for fusion. Finally, MERS-CoV releases its genetic materials into target cells ( Figure 1B) [11, 12] . Disrupting the process of MERS-6HB formation can inhibit virus-cell membrane fusion and abolish viral infection [13, 14] . Our previous studies found that a peptide, MERS-HR2P, derived from the MERS-CoV HR2 region, could prevent the formation of the fusion core by competitively binding to HR1 and blocking the native interaction between HR1 and HR2 ( Figure 1B) . MERS-HR2P has no effect on SARS-CoV infection, and SARS-CoV HR2-derived peptide, CP-1, failed to inhibit MERS-CoV infection [14, 15] , suggesting that MERS-HR2P is specific for inibiting MERS-CoV infection. Whether other novel and potent peptide fusion inhibitors can be developed against MERS-CoV from other coronavirus HR2 regions is still unclear.",

Phylogenetically, MERS-CoV is very closely related to Tylonycteris sp. Bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) ( Figure 1A ). Similar to MERS-CoV, HKU4 also harbors the ability to use human DPP4 as the receptor for infecting the target cell [19, 20] . We herein identified that HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3 peptides, derived from the HKU4 HR2 region, could bind MERS-HR1P, a MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide, and mimic the interaction of MERS-CoV HR1 and HR2 regions to form stable 6-HB. Moreover, these peptides exhibited significant inhibitory activity in both MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and pseudovirus infection assay, with even more potency than that of the reported peptide, MERS-HR2P. Taken together, these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be considered as candidates for the development of anti-MERS-CoV agents for clinical use.",

Consistent with our previous studies [14] , the complex of MERS-HR1P/MERS-HR2P showed high thermostability with the Tm value of 87.1 \u00b0C. Similarly, the complexes formed by MERS-HR1P and HKU4-HR2P peptides also possess strong thermostability with Tm values ranging from 83.5 to 90.5 \u00b0C ( Figure 3E ). These results show that all three HKU4-HR2 peptides can bind MERS-HR1P and form 6-HB formation with good stability. Among them, HKU4-HR2P2 exhibited the highest binding affinity to MERS-HR1P and formed the most \u03b1-helicity, suggesting that it alone might have the most potent anti-MERS-CoV effect.

Based on numerous epidemiological studies, researchers have found some mutant sites in the spike protein of MERS-CoV, in particular Q1020, which is under strong positive selection in the S2 subunit [32, 33] .

Therefore, to further assess whether these new peptides would possess broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV activity, we used the pseudotyped S-mediated MERS-CoVs with Q1020H and Q1020R mutant sites to infect target cells in the presence of each peptide.

However, these peptides exhibited no obvious inhibition on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein-mediated pseudovirus infection at the concentration up to 10 \u00b5M ( Figure S2A) . The results from a time-of-removal assay indicated that the inhibitory activity of the peptides on MERS-CoV pseudovirus is not associated with the binding of the peptides to the target cells ( Figure S2B ). Besides, these peptide at high concentration (100 \u00b5M) showed no cytotoxicity ( Figure S2C ). All these results suggest that the fusion inhibitory activity of these peptides is not because of their non-specific interaction with the viral or cellular membranes or proteins, nor their cytotoxicity to the target cells.

Subsequently, there have been numerous reports showing that peptides derived from the HR2 domain in the class I membrane fusion proteins of some enveloped viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [36] , paramyxoviruses simian virus 5 (SV5) [37] , Nipah virus [38] , and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [39] , exhibit inhibitory activity against the corresponding viruses. Similarly, in our previous work, we found that both MERS-HR2P, derived from MERS-CoV HR2 region, and CP-1, derived from SARS-CoV HR2 region, exhibited effective fusion-inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [14, 15] . However, MERS-HR2P had no inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, and SARS-HR2P (CP-1) had no inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV, suggesting that the HR2-derived peptides lacked cross-inhibitory activity, thus limiting the development of broad HCoV fusion inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, we herein report, for the first time, that BatCoV HR2-derived peptides, namely HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, could successfully cross-bind MERS-HR1P to form stable 6-HB. These peptides, especially HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and effectively blocked pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection, indicating the existence of a potent fusion inhibitor against MERS-CoV infection in the natural BatCoV HR2 region.",

All peptides exhibited antiviral activity against MERS-CoV infection. Apart from HR2 helices, previous studies also suggested that the N-and C-terminal tail regions of HR2 could be important to the inhibitory activity of peptides [40] . Indeed, the three HKU4 HR2-derived peptides possess different terminal tail regions and exhibited various antiviral activity against MERS-CoV infection. On the other hand, the location of HKU4-HR2P2 in the HKU4 HR2 region is the same as that of MERS-HR2P in the MERS-CoV HR2 region. However, the higher helicity (80.3%) and Tm value (90.5 \u2022 C) of the HKU4-HR2P2/MERS-HR2 complex than those of the MERS-HR2P2/MERS-HR2 complex may contribute to the higher anti-MERS-CoV activity of HKU4-HR2P2 than that of MERS-HR2P.",

The precise antiviral mechanism is worth elucidating in future studies, but it can be speculated here that the answer might lie in the C-terminal tail of HKU4-HR2P3, which belongs to the tryptophan (Trp)-rich membrane proximal external region (MPER). This is best exemplified by SARS-CoV MPER-derived peptide, which can interact with the internal fusion peptide (IFP23) to inhibit the formation of MPER-IFP heteromer, a putative quaternary structure that extends from the 6-HB and functions in membrane fusion [41, 42] . Moreover, the MPER-derived peptide could directly inhibit the SARS-CoV entry. HKU4-HR2P3 exhibited similar potent inhibitory activity likely from the blocking of MERS-CoV 6-HB formation and disturbance of the interaction between MPER and IFP in MERS-CoV infection. This clearly constitutes a novel strategy for the development of MERS-CoV peptide fusion inhibitors with bispecific targets: HR1 and IFP.",

Nonetheless, we have previously reported that conjugation of the T4 fibritin trimerization domain, Foldon (Fd), to the HR1 (or NHR) peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41, such as N36Fd and N28Fd, make the NHR peptides fold into stable and soluble trimeric coiled-coils with potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity [46] .

Consistent with our previous studies[14], the complex of MERS-HR1P/MERS-HR2P showed high thermostability with the Tm value of 87.1 \u2022 C. Similarly, the complexes formed by MERS-HR1P and HKU4-HR2P peptides also possess strong thermostability with Tm values ranging from 83.5 to 90.5 \u2022 C (Figure 3E). These results show that all three HKU4-HR2 peptides can bind MERS-HR1P and form 6-HB formation with good stability. Among them, HKU4-HR2P2 exhibited the highest binding affinity to MERS-HR1P and formed the most \u03b1-helicity, suggesting that it alone might have the most potent anti-MERS-CoV effect.",
