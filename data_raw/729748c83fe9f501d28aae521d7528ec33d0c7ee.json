(1) Its einstein (S\u00e3o Paulo). 2018;16(4): [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] physical and chemical characteristics consist of low molecular weight, low density (one third of the density of oxygen), high viscosity, high diffusion coefficient (greater than that of carbon monoxide), and it is a biologically inert gas. (1, 2) Its use in clinical practice was based on these characteristics. Commercially, we find the mixture at concentrations 80:20 (80% helium and 20% oxygen), 70:30, and 60:40 -respectively, helium:oxygen concentrations.",

            "text": "The clinical applicability of Heliox \u00ae is described primarily in obstructive diseases, such as asthma, bronchiolitis, and laryngitis. (3) (4) (5) (6) Due to the physicalchemical properties of the mixture (especially low density and high viscosity), it has a direct influence on the flow and resistance of the respiratory system. (3, 7) In 1934, Barach et al., confirmed that the use of the helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) decreases the transpulmonary pressure and improves tidal volume in an experimental study with tracheostomized dogs. (8) Physiologically, the proximal airways have a turbulent flow pattern which becomes laminar in the terminal airways. In patients with obstructive disease, the turbulent flow of the proximal airways worsens respiratory distress and decreases lung ventilation. The use of heliox changes the flow pattern in the proximal airways from turbulent to laminar, thus decreasing respiratory work. (9, 10) The report of Heliox \u00ae use in children with asthma has shown conflicting results. Conventional treatment is sufficient in most cases of disease exacerbation. Since it is a more expensive gas that oxygen, Heliox \u00ae should not be used as a first choice; whereas in more severe cases, it seems to be beneficial, and its early use can decrease respiratory work and dyspnea. (11) There is a great difference in establishing a consensus as to the use of Heliox \u00ae in children due to the difference in criteria related to inclusion, time of intervention, treatment given, and severity of the disease in known studies. The role of Heliox \u00ae in the exacerbation of asthma has not yet been determined. (12, 13) On the other hand, some studies have identified the effect of Heliox \u00ae in the production of particles by jet nebulizers. The delivery efficacy of aerosol with Heliox \u00ae is related to its low density. By becoming laminar, the turbulent flow improves ventilation in high resistance areas, affording optimization of aerosol deposition in lower airways. (14) (15) (16) The use of the helium-oxygen mixture is not restricted to patients with spontaneous breathing. Its benefits may be associated to use of non-invasive and even invasive ventilation -as long as the synergistic treatments are taken into consideration. (17) (18) (19) The effect of Heliox \u00ae in decreasing the inflammatory process of respiratory distress syndrome patients, despite being confirmed, is not yet understood. (20) Even so, the clinical applicability of the helium-oxygen mixture has gained prominence in intensive therapy environments, even though there still is no consensus as to its use.",

Use of the helium-oxygen mixture showed a significant reduction in the respiratory distress score and in respiratory rate of our patients in the first 30 minutes, with a continued reduction for up to 120 minutes. The most significant improvement of the distress score in the first 30 minutes can be attributed to the change in airflow pattern, which becomes more laminar with the use of Heliox \u00ae .

In two successful cases, there was an association with noninvasive ventilation. With a good response, this association is indicated, since Heliox \u00ae and noninvasive mechanical ventilation are considered synergistic and complementary therapies; we further point out, however, that the need for ventilators prepared to receive the mixture limits the process. Martin\u00f3n-Torres et al., conducted a randomized crossover study in 12 infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis, noting a significant improvement of SpO 2 and of respiratory work, when noninvasive mechanical ventilation was associated with Heliox \u00ae . (30) A review as to the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation with Heliox \u00ae reinforces the complementary role of both therapies, exposing that the association of the two can guarantee a promising future for the treatment of various illnesses. (19) Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of Heliox \u00ae with a high-flow nasal cannula had a significant influence on the improvement of oxygenation and respiratory rate, and can be a successful alternative in the future, since it demands more accessible equipment than the microprocessed ventilators used in noninvasive mechanical ventilation. (31, 32) In our study, we chose to observe the cases of bronchospasm and wheezing, disorders in which Heliox \u00ae improved gas exchange, decreased respiratory work, and prevented reintubation. (33) Our protocol included children who maintained the moderate to severe severity score after one hour of conventional treatment. This limited the number of children included in the study, since the majority of children with obstructive diseases improved with conventional intervention during the first hour. Another limitation of the study is that it was retrospective, which limits the results and its interpretations.",

(34) \u275a CONCLUSION Use of Heliox \u00ae in children with obstructive diseases showed positive outcomes, with a significant reduction in the distress score and respiratory rate in the first 30 minutes of use. Therefore, Heliox \u00ae can be considered a support in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure from obstructive causes.",
