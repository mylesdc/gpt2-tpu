During Marburg virus (MARV) infection, large quantities of the viral glycoprotein GP are produced in the ER; this may result in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The most conserved pathway to trigger UPR is initiated by IRE1. Activation of IRE1 results in auto-phosphorylation, splicing of the XBP1 mRNA and translation of the XBP1s protein. XBP1s binds cis-acting UPR elements (UPRE) which leads to the enhanced expression of genes which should restore ER homeostasis. XBP1u protein is translated, if IRE1 is not activated. Here we show that ectopic expression of MARV GP activated the IRE1-XBP1 axis of UPR as monitored by UPRE luciferase assays. However, while at 24 h of infection with MARV IRE1 was phosphorylated, expression of XBP1s was only slightly enhanced and UPRE activity was not detected. The IRE1-XBP1 axis was not active at 48 h p.i. Co-expression studies of MARV proteins demonstrated that the MARV protein VP30 suppressed UPRE activation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an RNA-dependent interaction of VP30 with XBP1u. Knock-out of IRE1 supported MARV infection at late time points. Taken together, these results suggest that efficient MARV propagation requires specific regulation of IRE1 activity.",

The excision of a 26-nucleotide fragment creates an mRNA variant encoding a spliced XBP1 protein, XBP1s, which transcriptionally activates genes controlled by specific promoter sequences, for example, the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) [8] . Activation of UPREs was originally thought to depend solely on XBP1s [9] ; however, it was recently found that both ATF6 and XBP1 contribute to the activation of UPRE [7] . Under non-UPR conditions, translation of XBP1u mRNA produces \"unspliced\" XBP1 (XBP1u). A translation-pausing motif in the XBP1u mRNA causes a transient pause in XBP1u translation, and the complex of the XBP1u's nascent protein chain, its own mRNA and the ribosome are recognized by the signal recognition particle and recruited to the ER membrane, where phosphorylated IRE1 mediates splicing of the XBP1u mRNA [10] .",

The single-stranded negative-sense viral RNA is complexed with the nucleoprotein NP (ribonucleoprotein complex, RNP). In MARV-infected cells, NP induces the formation of viral inclusion bodies, which are found in close association with the rough ER [16] and represent the sites of viral replication and transcription [17] . Associated with the RNP are the viral proteins L, VP35, VP24 and the viral transcription factor VP30 [18, 19] . The MARV matrix protein VP40 is the driving force for viral budding [20, 21] . GP is synthesized at the ER and further transported to the plasma membrane via the classical secretory pathway [22] . GP is highly glycosylated with mannose-rich and complex-type N-glycans and with mucin-type O-glycans. The majority of both the N-and O-glycans are attached to a mucin-like domain (MLD) [23] . GP plays an essential role during MARV infection of target cells by binding to the cellular receptor and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. MARV infection results in the production of large amounts of viral proteins in the cytosol. GP is translocated into the ER, where it accumulates; it is only slowly released to the Golgi and transported to the plasma membrane [22] .",

The expression of XBP1s is dependent on the posttranscriptional splicing of XBP1u mRNA by IRE1. It excises 26 nucleotides from the XBP1u mRNA, resulting in a frame shift. To monitor this event, we fused GFP to XBP1s. If IRE1 is silent, Flag-XBP1u is expressed. When IRE1 is activated, XBP1u mRNA splicing leads to the expression of Flag-XBP1s-GFP. Both variants can be detected by the N-terminal Flag tag; XBP1s can be visualized by GFP. To stimulate XBP1 splicing, cells were treated with Tg (5 nM) or with Tu (300 nM) for 16 h or transfected with plasmids encoding MARV proteins. The cells were analysed by Western blotting and by fluorescence microscopy (transfected cells).

We used a firefly luciferase-based reporter construct that contains a UPR cis-active promoter element regulated by the transcription factors XBP1s and ATF6 (p5xUPRE-GL3) [8] . Our system was calibrated using thapsigargin (Tg) or tunicamycin (Tu). Tg inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPases (SERCA) and thus halts the active transport of Ca 2+ into the ER, leading to depletion of Ca 2+ levels and UPR activation [35] . Tu blocks N-linked glycosylation, thereby interfering with protein folding, and causes UPR activation [36, 37] . HuH7 cells were transfected with p5xUPRE-GL3 and a plasmid that expresses the Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter (pGL4.73). The transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Tg or Tu. Treatment of the cells with either substance resulted in a concentration-dependent induction of UPRE ( Figure  S1 ). The lowest concentrations of Tg and Tu that reliably induced UPRE were 5 and 300 nM, respectively; these concentrations were used in further experiments except where otherwise indicated.",

Western blot analyses confirmed the expression of the viral proteins, and no obvious differences in the levels of expression of the wild-type and HA-tagged versions were observed (Figure 1(a) ). Importantly, in-gel detection of HA-tagged proteins using an antibody against HA showed that the signal strengths of GP and VP35 were similar, whereas NP appeared to be expressed in higher amounts (Figure 1(b) ).

Deletion of the MLD specifically removes most of the glycan acceptor sites [23, 38] . Western blot analyses showed that after transfection of cells with the two plasmids at identical concentrations, the expression level of GP dMLD was higher compared to that of GP although the activation of UPRE was reduced ( Figure S2) . Therefore, the amount of the GP dMLD plasmid used in transfection was reduced to 100 or 25 ng (Figure 1(d,e) ). Transfection of 25 ng resulted in the expression of similar amounts of GP dMLD and GP proteins at 48 h after transfection (Figure 1(e) ). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of single cells expressing GP or GP dMLD revealed that the two proteins showed comparable localization patterns and signal strengths ( Figure S3 ). Under these conditions, GP dMLD did not activate the UPRE reporter (Figure 1(d) ). It is presumed that due to the reduced number of glycosylation sites in GP dMLD , the ER transit of GP dMLD occurs more rapidly than that of GP; this is likely the reason why GP dMLD -expressing cells exhibit less ER stress. Taken together, the data show that intracellular expression of MARV GP leads to activation of the UPRE.",

Co-expression of VP30 significantly reduced the UPRE activation triggered by GP (Figure 4(a) ). Surprisingly, co-expression of GP with NP led to an increase in reporter activity. In addition, all MARV proteins were ectopically expressed, which is equivalent to the conditions used for the production of infectious virus-like particles (iVLPs) [25] . Under these conditions, UPRE activity was also significantly reduced, supporting the idea that VP30 also exerts a UPRE-balancing activity in MARV-infected cells (Figure 4(a) ). Moreover, although VP30 levels are much lower in the iVLP setting than during co-expression of VP30 alone, reduction in GP-induced UPRE is almost equivalent suggesting that other viral factors contribute to the UPRE balancing effect. Western blot analyses show the expression of the viral proteins (Figure 4(b) ).",

Additionally, the accumulation of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) leads to activation of the UPR [42] . In both cases, the UPR was activated both by infection and by ectopic expression of the respective glycoproteins. In contrast, the ectopic expression of MARV GP, but not MARV infection itself, resulted in UPRE activation, although similar amounts of GP were present in infected and transfected cells ( Figure  3(b) ). Explaining this unexpected result, we were able to demonstrate that the MARV transcription factor VP30 weakened the GP-dependent activation of UPRE.

Future analyses are needed to investigate the mechanistic details of the binding. Cytoplasmic splicing of the XBP1u mRNA by IRE1 at the ER membrane results in the translation of XBP1s, which is then transported into the nucleus, where it activates UPRE-controlled and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect endogenous IRE1 (total and phosphorylated) and XBP1s proteins as explained in the legend to Figure 3 . Total and phosphorylated IRE1 was quantified in each sample, compared to each other and set in relation to Tg-treated samples (set to 1). XBP1s levels were quantified and presented as relative values to DMSO-treated cells (set to 1). The experiments were performed three times.

            "text": "Although many viruses activate UPR, the way in which each virus addresses this cellular response is different. Some viruses seem to benefit from UPR, whereas the growth of others is impaired [13, 48] . Other viruses do not activate UPR because they have developed strategies to suppress UPR. For example, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) suppresses IRE1dependent UPR at early stages of infection through the action of the viral protein UL41, which degrades XBP1 mRNA via its RNase activity [49] . Su et al. showed that the kinase activity of IRE1 was beneficial to HSV-1 infection, whereas the RNase activity of IRE1 was detrimental [50] . Furthermore, the kinase activity of IRE1 results in the activation of c-Jun Nterminal kinase, which enhances the replication of HSV-1. Human and murine cytomegaloviruses (HCMV and MCMV) activate and manipulate the UPR to promote its pro-survival activity. UPR is inhibited by the M50 protein (MCMV) and the UL50 protein (HCMV), which target IRE1 for degradation [51] . Interestingly, deletion of XBP1u/s impedes MCMV gene expression, thereby causing a kinetic delay in infection [14] . These examples indicate that herpesviruses specifically regulate UPR at certain points in their replication cycles and suggest that tight regulation of the UPR is essential for efficient viral infection. We hypothesize that MARV also time-dependently regulates the IRE1 signalling for its own purpose. During the first 24 h p.i., which corresponds to the first MARV replication cycle, it may be that viral replication is more efficient when IRE1 is present and active (Figure 6(a), Figure 7 ). At this time point after infection, IRE1 is phosphorylated ( Figure  6(a) ), but XBP1s expression is only slightly increased. We believe that VP30 weakens the activation of the cascade by a so far unknown mechanism to achieve optimal conditions for viral propagation during its first replication cycle. Later in the course of infection the IRE1 KO seems to support viral infection. Further analyses are required to characterize the contribution of IRE1 and its different functions [52] to MARV replication in more detail.",
