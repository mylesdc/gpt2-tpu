            "text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are thought to be important in cell-cell communication and have elicited extraordinary interest as potential biomarkers of disease. However, quantitative methods to enable elucidation of mechanisms underlying release are few. Here, we describe a cell-based assay for monitoring EV release using the EV-enriched tetraspanin CD63 fused to the small, ATP-independent reporter enzyme, Nanoluciferase. Release of CD63-containing EVs from stably expressing cell lines was monitored by comparing luciferase activity in culture media to that remaining in cells. HEK293, U2OS, U87 and SKMel28 cells released 0.3%-0.6% of total cellular CD63 in the form of EVs over 5 hrs, varying by cell line. To identify cellular machinery important for secretion of CD63-containing EVs, we performed a screen of biologically active chemicals in HEK293 cells. While a majority of compounds did not significantly affect EV release, treating cells with the plecomacrolides bafilomycin or concanamycin, known to inhibit the V-ATPase, dramatically increased EV release. Interestingly, alkalization of the endosomal lumen using weak bases had no effect, suggesting a pH-independent enhancement of EV release by V-ATPase inhibitors. The ability to quantify EVs in small samples will enable future detailed studies of release kinetics as well as further chemical and genetic screening to define pathways involved in EV secretion.",

EVs are thought to mediate cell-cell communication [1] and may carry a variety of proteins, lipids and RNA with potential to impact target cell physiology. It has been proposed that EVs modulate tumor environments to allow for tumor seeding and growth and promote angiogenesis [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . EVs have also been implicated in the prion-like spread of neuropathogenic protein aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Certain viruses and bacteria such as hepatitis A virus [16] , herpesvirus 6 [17] , HTLV-1 [18] , HIV [19, 20] and uropathogenic E. coli a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 [21, 22] may use the cellular pathways of EV biogenesis for extracellular release. Recent studies in many laboratories have focused on exploring the utility of EVs isolated directly from biological fluids as disease biomarkers [23, 24] . Finally, EVs are also being developed as therapeutic agents capable of delivering drugs to specific tissues or organs in the body [3, 25, 26] .",

            "text": "EVs are produced in at least two distinct ways. Fusion of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane releases intraluminal vesicles in the form of exosomes whereas direct outward budding of the plasma membrane generates ectosomes, also referred to as microvesicles. Based on the origin of EVs a number of proteins are well established as markers. Among these are the tetraspanins characterized by four membrane spanning helices, including most notably CD63 [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . CD63 is predominantly localized to the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of late endosomes and MVBs and is thus enriched on exosomes [31] [32] [33] . Cytoplasmic proteins including members of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, syntenin, and certain chaperones are also enriched in EVs [32, 34] . In addition, a variety of RNAs are present and thought to carry signals involved in cell-cell communication [35] [36] [37] . Several packaged miRNAs have been shown to exert specific biological effects supporting the notion that EV cargo is actively selected. Mechanistic understanding of how cargo is selected and packaged into EVs and how EV release is regulated will be important for future progress in this area.",

Most studies of EVs depend on efficiently collecting them from cell culture media or biological fluids using high speed centrifugation or precipitation-based methods [39] . As cultured cells produce small quantities of EVs, analytical studies tend to require large volumes of conditioned media from cells cultured over one or more days which may be contaminated with material associated with cell injury and death. Moreover, typically used isolation procedures are inefficient, with extensive losses that preclude reproducible and quantitative yield [40] . Thus, better methods are needed to quantify EVs in small samples to facilitate chemical and genetic screens both to elucidate cell biological mechanisms involved in EV biogenesis and to identify strategies to modulate EV production.",

In this study, we maintained cells in media containing 0.2\u03bcg/ml Tet to maintain cells in a constitutively 'on' state. Typically, 50-100,000 cells per well were plated in a 24-well plate as needed for the conditions to be tested. After 18-24h for cell attachment, cells were washed twice with media to remove previously released EVs. Fresh media containing appropriate drugs (as indicated in the figures) was added to cells in 0.5ml media per well. Effects of the drugs were measured after indicated duration (typically 5 hours). At the end of the treatment, 250\u03bcl of conditioned media was removed into labeled 1.5ml tubes and centrifuged at 16000g for 5 minutes to remove large cell debris. Supernatants (media & EV) were collected into fresh tubes. To the cells in the remaining 250\u03bcl of media in the 24-well plate, 5\u03bcl of 10% Triton X100 was added (final 0.2%) to permeabilize cells and to release all contents (total). We confirmed that Triton X100 does not alter Nluc activity in HANL or HANLCD63 samples (see S2 Fig) . 50\u03bcl of 'media & EV' samples and 1:10 diluted 'total' samples (5\u03bcl of sample+45ul of blank media) were transferred to 96-well plates (Costar #3915). To each well containing sample, 25\u03bcl of Nano-Glo luciferase assay (Promega Cat# N1110) reagent (prepared as per manufacturer's instructions) was added. Luminescence was measured immediately after reagent addition using a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy hybrid H2). Background luminescence in media-only blanks was also measured within each plate. Samples were measured in duplicates or triplicates and averages were plotted. To obtain an unbiased quantitation of EVs in various samples, a ratio of luminescence in 'media & EV' to that in 'total' cell lystates is reported, termed 'Fractional Release'.",

In addition to fusing Nluc to CD63, we also developed a soluble Nluc reporter to monitor non-specific leakage of cellular contents resulting from cell injury or death. Nluc is a 19kDa luciferase based on a naturally occurring monomeric luciferase from the deep-sea shrimp, Oplophorus sp. [41] . Nluc utilizes the coelenterazine analog furimazine as substrate to produce a bright glow-type luminescence in an ATP-independent reaction. Nluc has been engineered for use in a variety of applications requiring quantitative and sensitive measurements [41] . To enable antibodybased monitoring of the fusion proteins we introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of Nluc to generate HANL ( Fig 1A) . Since CD63 has a GYXXF-motif near its C-terminus that binds clathrin adaptor proteins and is involved in sorting [42] and GFP fusions at the N-terminus have been successful in previous studies [43, 44] , we fused HANL to the cytoplasmic N-terminus of CD63 to generate HANLCD63 (Fig 1A) . HANL and HANLCD63 were cloned under a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible promoter and transfected into cells for selection of stable cell lines.",

Expression of HANL and HANLCD63 was induced by adding Tet to TRex293 cell lines. We compared expression in cells incubated overnight with a high concentration (1\u03bcg/ml) of Tet to that in cells grown in the continuous presence of a low concentration (0.2\u03bcg/ml) of Tet over three passages (about 10 generations). Tet-induced expression of HANL or HANLCD63 did not affect the rate of cell growth or cell number relative to uninduced controls (data not shown). Immunoblotting cell lysates for CD63 revealed that HANLCD63 was expressed inducibly at a level comparable to or less than that of endogenous CD63 (Fig 1B) . Immunoblotting HANL samples for HA showed that HANL was strongly induced in response to Tet (Fig 1B) . Quantitation of bands in Fig 1B showed that in Tet-induced samples expressing HANLCD63, an additional band at 75kDa (band#1 in S1 Fig) corresponding to HANLCD63 was observed. Relative quantitation of endogenous CD63 and HANLCD63 was not feasible since both endogenous CD63 and HANLCD63 migrated as multiple bands (Fig 1B and S1 Fig) . Similar results were obtained using Tet-inducible U2OS cells (S1 Fig). Next, we examined HANLCD63 and HANL localization by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy ( Fig 1C) . We compared the distribution of HA-tag with that of the late endosome/lysosome protein, LAMP1. In cells expressing HANLCD63, HA-signal was distributed similarly to that of LAMP1 on intracellular organelles. A small proportion of HANLCD63 was also observed on the plasma membrane as expected for endogenous and overexpressed CD63 [44] . In contrast, HA staining in HANL expressing cells was diffusely present throughout the cytoplasm and distinct from LAMP1 confirming its cytoplasmic distribution as expected. HANLCD63 expressed in U2OS cells also mostly colocalized with LAMP1 (S1 Fig).",

To do this, we added 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) to conditioned cell media as described earlier [44] and measured Nluc activity in PEG soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig 2A) . Although PEG precipitation is not selective for EVs, this method provides a simple and robust method for quantitative collection of EV-associated CD63 from conditioned media [44] . In HANL samples nearly all of the Nluc activity was found in the PEG soluble fraction. In HANLCD63 samples most of the Nluc activity was found in the PEG insoluble fraction consistent with the presence of HANLCD63 in EVs. We further confirmed this by immunoblotting PEG pellets with CD63 antibody (Fig 2B) . In PEG pellets from HANL cell media only a single band of endogenous CD63 was detected with molecular weight of 50-60kDa (band# 2), whereas in HANLCD63 derived samples additional bands at higher molecular weights (band# 1) were observed consistent with additional recovery of HA tagged HANLCD63. The proportional signal in bands associated with HANLCD63 and endogenous CD63 is similar in cell lysates (shown in Fig 1B) and EVs (shown in Fig 2B) , suggesting that the tagged and endogenous protein are incorporated similarly into EVs. Together with the localization of HANLCD63 to LAMP1-marked late endosomes and lysosomes, we conclude that the Nluc activity of HANLCD63 can be used to monitor EV associated CD63.",

This allowed us to report EV release in comparative terms as the ratio of extracellular to total Nluc activity or 'fractional release'. To do this, we collected conditioned media at the time indicated and then replaced it with same volume of media containing 0.2% Triton X100 to extract HANLCD63 remaining in the cells. (See S2 Fig showing no effect of Triton X100 on Nluc activity of HANL and HANLCD63). In TRex293 (HEK293) cells, a small portion (0.1-0.3%) of total cellular HANLCD63 was released in EVs during a 5 hr collection period (Fig 3) . For insight into how fractional release of EVs and cytoplasmic proteins varies among different cell lines, we generated and characterized U2OS, SKMel28 and U87-MG cells stably expressing HANLCD63. HANLCD63 was localized to LAMP1-positive endosomes as in TRex293 cells (Fig 1C, S1 Fig and data not shown) . Interestingly, different cell lines exhibited different levels of EV release over a 5h period (Fig 3) . While HEK293, U2OS and U87 cells showed a fractional release of between 0.1%-0.4%, SKMel28 cells released about 0.6% of total cellular HANLCD63. This result underscores the utility of this assay system for defining EV production by different types of cells. We used stably transfected TRex293 cells for most experiments in this study. Important clues to understanding EV biogenesis and how it can be modulated can come from monitoring the kinetics of EV release. Given the inefficiencies of current exosome isolation methods, EV release has, however, mostly been studied after single prolonged collection times without time resolution or specific normalization to parent cells. Our model system is well suited to monitoring the kinetics of EV release. To measure fractional release of EV associated HANLCD63 or cytoplasmic HANL at different times after initiating collection, conditioned media and cell extracts were collected and used to measure Nluc activity. The time course of HANLCD63 release shows that low initial amounts of Nluc activity in the media (roughly 0.1% of cellular HANLCD63) steadily increase over 6h, reaching a fractional release of approximately 0.5%. This five-fold increase demonstrates both the sensitivity of this model system for detecting changes in EV release and, importantly, that under these baseline conditions EVs are being continuously released. In cells expressing HANL, the amount of Nluc present in the media (roughly 0.2-0.3% of cellular HANL) remains unchanged over 6 hours ( Fig  4A & 4B) . Based on the fact that most extracellular HANL was not precipitated by adding PEG (Fig 2A) , we interpret its presence to reflect some form of cell or membrane damage, most likely associated with media change and washing at the beginning of the experiment.",

Concanamycin stimulated EV release to levels comparable to that seen with bafilomycin, while ammonium chloride again had no effect on EV release (Fig 6C) .

These inhibitors, either singly or in combination, also had no effect on HANLCD63 release suggesting that accumulation of undegraded proteins in endolysosomes is not a strong trigger for EV release (Fig 6C) . To understand whether the stimulatory effect of V-ATPase inhibitors depends on changing organelle pH, we treated cells with bafilomycin together with ammonium chloride or chloroquine. Stimulated release of HANLCD63 by V-ATPase inhibition was unaffected by alkalizing agents (S5 Fig), suggesting that inhibiting V-ATPase alone was necessary and sufficient to promote enhanced release of HANLCD63.",

To do this, we fused a small ATP-independent luciferase to the endolysosomal tetraspanin CD63 as a reporter for EVs. In addition, luciferase localized to the cytoplasm was used as a reporter for non-specific release cytoplasmic due to damage and injury to cells. This enables direct determination of EV marker release following different cell treatments. Using these markers, we established that different cultured cell lines differ in EV production. We also observed that EVs are constitutively and continuously released over a several hour time period, again distinct from cytosolic leakage. This system enabled a first pass broad-spectrum screen using compounds with known mechanistic targets, paving the way for future delineation of mechanisms of EV biogenesis. An important finding from this screen was the importance of V-ATPase activity in regulating EV release.",

Nluc luminescence is ATP-independent and~150 times brighter than firefly or Renilla luciferase [59] . Further, Nluc has no disulfide binds and is therefore well suited for expression in the cytoplasm and on the cytoplasmic extensions of transmembrane proteins such as CD63; this is distinct from another small and bright luciferase derived from Gaussia which has many disulfide bonds and is therefore better suited for expression on lumenal extensions of transmembrane proteins [60] . Luciferase-based tracking of exosomes and other EVs has been previously explored. Danzer et al., used a split Gaussia luciferase system to investigate the packaging and release specifically of aggregated \u03b1Synuclein as cargo within exosomes in cultured cells [61] ; the required aggregation step limited quantitative interpretation of EV release. Others have used membrane localized versions of Gaussia luciferase to monitor EVs in vivo [62, 63] . While this manuscript was under preparation, another report of Nluc fused to the C-terminal end of CD63 confirms the general utility of this tracer for tracking CD63-labelled membranes and EVs in vitro and in vivo [64] . However, C-terminal fusion of tracers to CD63 may perturb function of the GYXXF sorting signal present at the C-terminus of CD63 [42, 65, 66] .",

Results from this screen demonstrate that inhibitors of the V-ATPase, bafilomycin and concanamycin, were profound stimulators of EV release demonstrating the utility of this facile assay system in drug and genetic screens. However, with short EV collection times we were unable to validate the effects of the previously described inhibitor of EV biogenesis GW4869. This was potentially because the incubation period of 5h is shorter than that (16h) reported in literature [51] and needed to observe an effect or because overexpression of HANLCD63 may enhance EV biogenesis and obscure the effect of inhibitory drugs. Increases in the duration of drug treatment and EV collection may make the assay more suitable for screening for inhibitors of EV biogenesis.",

Bafilomycin-mediated stimulation of EV release was also observed in a recent paper [54] , wherein it was also shown that in HeLa cells, exosomes are retained on the plasma membrane by the action of tetherin. These authors also demonstrated that treatment of cells with bafilomycin interrupts cholesterol trafficking leading to cholesterol accumulation in endosomes and exosomes. In our study, we found that compounds that increase or decrease cholesterol did not alter EV release suggesting that accumulation of endosomal cholesterol was not likely to be the trigger for increased EV release. In K562 cells, small increases were observed in exosome release after treatment with either bafilomycin or chloroquine [47] . Importantly, in our HEK293-based system, unlike bafilomycin treatment, EV release could not be increased either by alkalizing of endosomal lumen or by inhibiting lysosomal proteases. This suggests that neither the lumenal pH of endosomes nor the lysosomal degradative capacity was responsible for increased exocytosis. An in vivo study in C. elegans revealed that the V-ATPase mediated apical secretion of exosomes containing hedgehog-related proteins [67] .",

EV biogenesis can be influenced by perturbations at various steps including generation of intralumenal vesicles, endosomal trafficking of CD63, motility of endosomes as well as exocytosis. It is possible that the V-ATPase complex itself might somehow be responsible for increased exocytosis. Bafilomycin and concanamycin bind to V 0 -ATPase complex presumably at the interface of the a-and c-subunits that sits in the lipid bilayer [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Binding of these inhibitors is thought to interfere with the helical swiveling required for proton translocation [74] . It is thought that association and dissociation of V 1 -ATPase complex with the V 0 complex is a key regulatory step for many cellular pathways [74] including exocytosis of synaptic vesicles [75] . The V 0 -V 1 ATPase complex has been shown to recruit key signaling machinery such as the mTOR kinase that sense endolysosomal function and generate an appropriate response to regulate protein synthesis and cholesterol transport (reviewed in [76, 77] ). Kozik et al, found an important role for V-ATPase in clathrin-coated vesicle formation [78] . Johnson et al, found that lower V-ATPase activity coincided with localization of endolysosomes to the cell periphery [52] , which could increase the probability of exocytosis and EV release. Merkulova et al, mapped several protein-protein interactions with the B1 subunit of the cytoplasmic V 1 ATPase complex and found that some (eg, rabconnectin 3) were involved in Rab3-mediated exocytosis [79] . V-ATPase was found to be required for Rab27B-dependent invasive growth and metastasis in breast cancer [80] suggesting that V-ATPase and the Rab GTPase implicated in exosome biogenesis were functionally connected. Clear understanding of whether bafilomycin increases or decreases the abundance of the V 0 -V 1 holoenzyme and its role in the association of exocytic machinery will illuminate its mode of action in exocytosis.",

In support of this idea, it has been observed that in C. elegans neurons stress resulted in the expulsion of a bolus of protein aggregates by exocytosis [81] . The autophagy protein, Atg5, was shown to dissociate the V1E subunit from the V 0 -V 1 ATPase complex to promote exosome production [82] . These observations suggest that reduced V-ATPase function due to accumulation of protein aggregates in endosomes/lysosomes may lead to extracellular release of potentially pathogenic protein aggregates which in turn could spread disease pathology in the brain.

Using this novel model system, we have identified the V-ATPase as an important regulator of EV secretion. Given the bright luminescence from Nluc, we predict that the construct presented in this paper may also be successfully used in vivo in surface as well as deep tissues as previously demonstrated [83] .",

EVs were isolated from HANL and HANLCD63 expressing TRex293 cells by ultracentrifugation at 100000g for 90 minutes at 4C. The EV pellets were resuspended in PBS containing no detergent (-Tx100) or with 0.1%Triton X-100 (+Tx100) and the NLuc luminescence was measured. No difference was obvious between -Tx100 and +Tx100 samples demonstrating that addition of Tx100 to NLuc samples does not affect luminescence. (PDF) NLuc luminescence was measured in conditioned culture media of HANL and HANLCD63 cells treated without (-Baf) or with 200nM bafilomycin (+Baf) and were either not co-treated (-AmmCl) or co-treated with 10mM ammonium chloride (+AmmCl) as an alkalizing agent. No difference was observed in +Baf samples with or without ammonium chloride cotreatment. This result shows that alkalizing agents do not influence increased EV release due to V-ATPase inhibitors.
