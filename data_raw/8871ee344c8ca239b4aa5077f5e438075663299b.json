            "text": "As of 2010 sub-Saharan Africa had approximately 865 million inhabitants living with numerous public health challenges. Several public health initiatives [e.g., the United States (US) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the US President's Malaria Initiative] have been very successful at reducing mortality from priority diseases. A competently trained public health workforce that can operate multi-disease surveillance and response systems is necessary to build upon and sustain these successes and to address other public health problems. Sub-Saharan Africa appears to have weathered the recent global economic downturn remarkably well and its increasing middle class may soon demand stronger public health systems to protect communities. The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been the backbone of public health surveillance and response in the US during its 60 years of existence. EIS has been adapted internationally to create the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) in several countries. In the 1990s CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation collaborated with the Uganda and Zimbabwe ministries of health and local universities to create 2-year Public Health Schools Without Walls (PHSWOWs) which were based on the FETP model. In 2004 the FETP model was further adapted to create the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) in Kenya to conduct joint competencybased training for field epidemiologists and public health laboratory scientists providing a master's degree to participants upon completion. The FELTP model has been implemented in several additional countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of 2010 these 10 FELTPs and two PHSWOWs covered 613 million of the 865 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and had enrolled 743 public health professionals. We describe the process that we used to develop 10 FELTPs covering 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa from 2004 to 2010 as a strategy to develop a locally trained public health workforce that can operate multi-disease surveillance and response systems.",

Achieving public health goals in sub-Saharan Africa remains an elusive target despite major donor funded initiatives, some of which have been widely successful. For example, the United States (US) President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) led to a marked reduction in malaria transmission in a few short years [2, 3] and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) markedly changed the fate of millions of HIV-infected people in the region and significantly reduced transmission of HIV from mothers to children [4] . Sub-Saharan Africa also suffers considerable preventable mortality from maternal deaths, deaths due to motor vehicle crashes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers [5, 6] .",

CDC's EIS program, now in its 60th year has been the backbone of CDC and US State health departments' surveillance and response systems. Similarly FELTPs are proven strategies for developing public health surveillance and response systems and can be adapted to address various public health issues. The link between 2-year training and short courses allows for flexibility to develop different but complementary skill sets within a country. Some countries, particularly those emerging from conflict situations may not be able to develop 2-year degree granting FELTPs but may be able to conduct FELTP short courses while sending a few public health professionals to a nearby FELTP to gain the competencies to start their own program. This strategy is currently underway between Southern Sudan and the Kenya FELTP, and Sierra Leone and the Ghana FELTP. The long-term success of FELTPs depends on their sustainability. The Uganda and Zimbabwe programs have sustained since the 1990s but the path to sustainability is not pre-determined and requires several issues to be in sync. The PHSWOWs in Uganda and Zimbabwe were the first programs of their nature and were designed to develop a specific cadre of public health professionals who were virtually guaranteed of jobs Page number not for citation purposes 6 utilizing their new competencies upon graduation. Both programs also included substantial training in health services management, and many graduates ended up heading district, provincial and national public health programs. FELTPs, which are developed with a closer link than PHSWOWs to development of national multi-disease surveillance and response systems and institutionalization of rapid response to public health emergencies, may require a redesign of existing public health systems to develop career paths for field epidemiologists and public health laboratory epidemiologists. Whereas the initial graduates from FELTPs can be absorbed into existing positions at national and sub-national level, the long-term sustainability of these programs requires the development of specific positions that can utilize their training appropriately.",

This is a common key requirement by all the FELTP steering committees, mainly to enhance the career prospects of the FELTP graduates. Universities also provide an academic anchor for the FELTP which leverages the credibility of the universities as the program starts up. The university faculty assists in teaching the didactic components of the course and the FELTP staff strengthens the university faculty by showing them how the field-based training model works, creating shared value between the FELTP and the university. Each FELTP student has an academic supervisor or mentor from the university in addition to the program and field site supervisors.",

            "text": "There is an ongoing discussion on how many FELTP and similarly trained public health workers are required to implement robust multi-disease surveillance and response systems in developing countries. Some authors have suggested that 3 to 5 FELTP graduates per million inhabitants in a country are needed, with a mix of field epidemiology, public health laboratory epidemiology, and veterinary epidemiology [23] . Based on this estimate sub-Saharan Africa would need between 2,600 and 4,500 FELTP graduates or similarly trained public health personnel for its population figures in 2010. Uganda with a population of 34 million in 2010 would require between 100 and 170 graduates and Zimbabwe would require a maximum of 65 graduates for a 13 million population. Both Uganda and Zimbabwe have exceeded these targets, and have a high retention of their graduates but still have challenges in their public health surveillance and response systems and continue to conduct training in their programs to strengthen public health systems [27] . We believe that beyond the number of FELTP and PHSWOW graduates there is a complementary need to develop functional and networked multi-disease surveillance and response units at national, provincial, and district levels. These units would need to be operated by a mix of FELTP and PHSWOW graduates and short course participants. It has been suggested that with functional networked multi-disease surveillance and response units, fewer graduates may be needed to operate a basic but robust public health surveillance and response system [23] . We suggest that a goal of having at least one functional multi-disease surveillance and response unit per million inhabitants in a country is worthwhile and feasible in sub-Saharan Africa. These units which would be operated by FELTP graduates and short course participants would be networked to form a multi-disease surveillance and response system for the country.",

First, while we believe that all these FELTPs will be sustainable like the Uganda and Zimbabwe programs, we cannot be absolutely certain. Nevertheless, the environment that led to the creation of these programs in response to a need for a locally trained public Page number not for citation purposes 7 health workforce that can operate disease surveillance and response systems for multiple conditions is likely to persist. We also believe that involvement of a high level MOH-led Steering Committee to oversee FELTP activities is likely to maintain these programs. Second, the FELTP model is still a relatively new endeavor that attempts to link public health laboratory epidemiology and field epidemiology workforce development which will need to be adapted to suit particular country environments, especially given the different career paths of the graduates of these programs.",

If funding for field sites diminishes there may be a reduction in their quality and the overall quality of the FELTP, which depends on maintenance of appropriate field-based training. Finally, the link between FELTPs and the development and funding of the appropriate structures at national and sub-national level to absorb FELTP graduates requires ongoing work with non-health stakeholders (e.g., the legislature, the ministries of finance and public service, and the private sector).",
