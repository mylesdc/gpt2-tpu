            "text": "Since its invention in 1985 the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a well-established method for amplification and detection of segments of double-stranded DNA. Incorporation of fluorogenic probe or DNA intercalating dyes (such as SYBR Green) into the PCR mixture allowed real-time reaction monitoring and extraction of quantitative information (qPCR). Probes with different excitation spectra enable multiplex qPCR of several DNA segments using multi-channel optical detection systems. Here we show multiplex qPCR using an economical EvaGreen-based system with single optical channel detection. Previously reported non quantitative multiplex realtime PCR techniques based on intercalating dyes were conducted once the PCR is completed by performing melting curve analysis (MCA). The technique presented in this paper is both qualitative and quantitative as it provides information about the presence of multiple DNA strands as well as the number of starting copies in the tested sample. Besides important internal control, multiplex qPCR also allows detecting concentrations of more than one DNA strand within the same sample. Detection of the avian influenza virus H7N9 by PCR is a well established method. Multiplex qPCR greatly enhances its specificity as it is capable of distinguishing both haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes as well as their ratio.",

Each channel requires its corresponding light source, filter set and a detector. Can multiplex qPCR be conducted in one channel, while demultiplexing the results in real-time? Probe-based systems cannot be used as there is no technique capable of distinguishing the PCR products in a real time. On the other hand intercalating dye based PCR has shown promising results as the products can be demultiplexed using melting curve analysis (MCA) once the PCR is completed 10 . However, this method can determine serotype of the DNA or RNA but does not provide quantitative information.

This temperature is given by a thermal control system typically using proportional integrated derivative (PID) method of feedback, the thermal mass of the sample H and the thermal conductance G between the heating block and the sample. The time constant \u03c4 of the temperature delay is given by \u03c4 = H/G. Values of H, G and PID constants do not change during the PCR process so the temperature profile of the sample is a repetitive function of time during the PCR cycling. This implies that it is sufficient to determine the temperature profile of the sample only during a single cycle. We have used a modified version (see Fig. 1 ) of the virtual reaction chamber (VRC) system for this experiment 13 . The heat transfer and the sample temperature profile was simulated by finite element analysis (FEA) and the results were experimentally verified 14 . The model gave us a correlation between the temperature of the heater and the sample during transition from annealing step to denaturation step required for the MCA extraction. The real sample experiment exhibited faster response than the model probably due to convection in the aqueous sample decreasing the temperature gradient minimally in the transition period. This also provided a homogenous temperature distribution, crucial to the method, since it suppresses data smearing.",

From both functions [F = f(t,n) and T = f(t,n)] we have then eliminated time and generated fluorescence as function of temperature [F = f(T,n)] with PCR cycle number as a parameter. We have thus performed a melting curve analysis (MCA) during each PCR cycle. Subsequently we plotted the first negative derivative of fluorescence with respect to temperature as a function of temperature \u2212 dF/dT = f(T). For each amplicon a distinct melting temperature was obtained, with its amplitude corresponding to its concentration at each cycle. PCR amplification curves were then created by plotting the amplitude of the respective amplicon as function of cycle number. This way we can quantitatively detect one or more different amplicons using only a single intercalating dye. We only need to perform continuous fluorescence detection at an acquisition rate at or above 1 kHz, thus conventional reagents and protocols can be still used.",

MCA was formed by numerical differentiation of the fluorescence with respect to temperature and its negative value was plotted as a function of temperature.

We have then added to the sample a second amplicon (NA) with a melting temperature of 68 \u00b0C. A second peak corresponding to this amplicon can be observed in the respective MCA (Fig. 3C,D) . Increasing the amount of NA added compared to HA lead to an even faster increase of the magnitude of peak at 68 \u00b0C (Fig. 3E,F) . Extracting the fluorescence amplitude from the derived curves for each cycle at 68 \u00b0C and 76 \u00b0C respectively, results in two PCR amplification curves. Figure 4A shows the two amplification curves extracted for the experiments with a higher concentration of NA than HA (experiments A1 to A5 in Table 2 ).",

For all other experiments we were able to extract two amplification curves, one at a temperature of 68 \u00b0C and the second one at temperature of 76 \u00b0C. Threshold cycles (C T ) were defined in the usual way. It was found that the difference in C T (\u2206C T ) of the two curves corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and NA. An overview of all conducted experiments is presented in Table 1 . The results indicate that \u2206C T corresponds to the expected values. We can then conclude that the method can be used for multiplexed quantitative PCR. As an example, (see Table 1 ) sample A5 has the concentration of NA 19 times higher than the concentration of HA. With 100% PCR efficiency one would expect a \u2206C T of 4.25 (log 2 19) . We have found the \u2206C T value to be 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 which is efficiency of 84%, reasonably close to the ideal value.",

It is necessary to run several replicates of the same experiment to suppress random errors and improve the result precision.

Differentiation of amplicons with melting point differences \u0394T m as small as 1.2 \u00b0C have been demonstrated in HRMCA. However the method presented in this contribution requires greater \u0394T m due to peak broadening caused by the high heating rate.",

This could be achieved by primer design since the melting temperature is a function of amplicon length and ratio of CG/AT content. Therefore an extension temperature of 60 \u00b0C and a denaturation temperature of 95 \u00b0C would allow for 6 different amplicons to be detected in the same droplet, assuming a \u0394T m of 5 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the temperature measured by the sensor in HRMCA corresponds practically to the sample temperature due to the slow scanning rate. In our approach the sample temperature lags behind the temperature measured by the sensor underneath the sample 18 . This can be seen from the comparative end point HRMCA done with the LightCycler, Fig. 4B shows the fluorescence amplitude plotted as function of temperature with a temperature gradient of 0.1 \u00b0C/s. In Fig. 4C the first negative derivative of this curve with respect to temperature is shown, displaying two distinct peaks. Both melting temperatures found on the LightCycler are 8 \u00b0C higher than the temperatures we measured in our system. Nevertheless this T m offset has no influence on quality of the results especially when this lag is known and the resulting temperature offset is calibrated.",

Our approach allows researchers to perform affordable multiplex PCR using simple tools as well as reagents. Another advantage compared to conventional methods is small consumption of reagents due to small sample volume. Fluorescent amplitude sampling at rate above 100 samples per second is, however, required for constructing MCA during transition from annealing/extension to denaturation. This method might be particularly interesting for determination of serotype of virus such as dengue fever or an avian influenza. Other potential applications include measurement of viral loads in a sample, differentiation between H7N9 and H7N5, and quantitative detection of co-infections. We have experimentally verified the method using a homemade PCR system primarily for convenience as we have 100% control of the tool. In principle any commercial real-time PCR device would be capable of performing the same protocol as long as it has available fluorescent amplitude sampling rate of 1kHz or higher and can process samples with small volume of a 1 \u03bc L or below.",
