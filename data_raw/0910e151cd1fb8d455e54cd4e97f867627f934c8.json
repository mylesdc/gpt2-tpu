However, when spatial analysis involves aggregated spatial data, results may be influenced by the spatial scale of aggregation, an effect known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). In this study, area level risk factors for both infections in 28,914 cats tested with ELISA were investigated by multivariable spatial Poisson regression models along with MAUP effect on spatial clustering and cluster detection (for postal codes, counties, and states) by Moran's test and spatial scan test, respectively. The study results indicate that the significance and magnitude of the association of risk factors with both infections varied with aggregation scale. Further more, Moran's test only identified spatial clustering at postal code and county levels of aggregation. Similarly, the spatial scan test indicated that the number, size, and location of clusters varied over aggregation scales. In conclusion, the association between infection and area was influenced by the choice of spatial scale and indicates the importance of study design and data analysis with respect to specific research questions.",

            "text": "Despite decades of discovery, clinical management of cats infected with FIV and FeLV is still challenging without the existence of an effective therapeutic intervention [3] . Therefore, better ways to control the infections and prophylactic management is the mainstay of disease prevention strategy for these infections. A number of previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of retroviral infections in domestic cat populations varies by regions and maybe attributed to variable population density, reproductive status, age, gender, and housing conditions [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . For the US and Canada, spatial variation in FIV and FeLV seroprevalence has been reported in previous studies that generated data for this research [1, 4] . Here we attempt to extend the findings by applying spatial statistical methods to illustrate geographic variation in the distribution of FIV and FeLV infections and assess the relationship with group-level risk factors. Spatial epidemiological methods are commonly used to identify, describe, and quantify spatial patterns in the distribution of health events. Spatial patterns commonly of 2 Journal of Veterinary Medicine interest include trends, clustering, and detection of clusters in the occurrence of health events in a population. Furthermore, geographic correlation studies can be important tools to evaluate the association of spatial or environmental risk factors with the occurrence of health events after adjusting for confounders. The identification of such spatial patterns may provide clues for further testable hypotheses about an unknown disease etiology [12] . Ecological studies, such as geographic correlation studies, are particularly valuable when an individual level association between infection and risk factors is evident and a group-level association is assessed to determine the population health impact [13] . To this effect, spatial analysis of FIV and FeLV infections can be a valuable tool in epidemiological understanding of these infections. Due to lack of individual level data and client confidentiality and to create meaningful units for data analysis, aggregated or area level data may be used to carry out such spatial epidemiological studies. However, the way areal units are defined can influence the results and inferences based on aggregated data. Specifically, the number or size of areas used and how the area boundaries are drawn can influence spatial data analysis. This has been termed the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and is a long known phenomenon [14, 15] in the geographical literature. The MAUP stems from the fact that areal units are usually arbitrarily determined and can be modified to form units of different sizes or spatial arrangements [16] . The MAUP consists of two interrelated components-the scale and zoning effects. The scale effect is the variation in results obtained when the areal data comprising smaller areal units is grouped to form increasingly larger units. The zoning effect, on the other hand, is the variation in results obtained due to alternative formations of areal units where the number of areal units is constant, that is, analysis comprising the same number of areal units but different area shapes [14, 17, 18] .",

Since the number of tested cats varied among the areas, smoothed seroprevalence estimates were estimated from crude seroprevalence (number of cats testing positive/number of cats tested) for each area using the empirical Bayesian (EB) estimation such that the area specific seroprevalence estimates were adjusted towards the overall mean.

High-risk cluster detection was performed by comparing the observed number of cases within the scanning window with the expected number, that is, if cases were to be distributed randomly in space [25] . In other words, detection of high-risk clusters would indicate the prevalence of FIV (or FeLV) inside the circular window as significantly higher than outside the window. The statistical significance of the clusters was established by Monte Carlo hypothesis testing using 999 Monte Carlo replications with a significance level set to = 5%. The significance of multiple clusters was tested sequentially conditional on the presence of the previously detected clusters such that secondary clusters were tested and reported only if the more likely clusters were significant [28] . The size of the scanning window in the spatial scan statistic was allowed to increase from individual areas and expanded to include neighbouring areas until a maximum of 50% of the total tested population. No geographical overlap of clusters was allowed. Detected clusters were visualized by plotting respective circles on a map of the study area.

Apart from describing the spatial patterns of disease in terms of clustering and cluster, geographic correlation analysis (or spatial regression modeling) for spatial data was carried out to quantify the effect of spatially referenced group-level risk factors on the spatial distribution of disease events, that is, FIV and FeLV infections [17, 29] . While these studies are similar to ecological regression methods, it is critical to adjust for the spatial autocorrelation in the data in order to prevent type errors, that is, providing \"statistically significant\" results when none exists [30] . Among many proposed methods for spatial regression modeling for areal data [17, 29, 31, 32] , Poisson distributed counts for rare disease or infections such as FIV and FeLV can be effectively modeled to assess its relationship with group-level risk factors using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with spatially correlated random effects, also known as spatial GLMM. In this study, interest was to evaluate group-level risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections as well as to quantify the effect of MAUP as change in magnitude and significance of regression parameters with spatial aggregation scale. For each aggregation level, the count of FIV and FeLV infections in each area was modelled as a function of the group-level covariates in a Poisson regression model framework with the log of number of tested cats as the offset.",

            "text": "Moran's coefficient indicated clustering of FIV and FeLV positive test results. However, the strength and significance of clustering varied across spatial aggregation levels. Given the infectious nature of both retroviruses, areas near each other are expected to have similar seroprevalence levels. Therefore, positive autocorrelation in FIV and FeLV seroprevalence was expected. As the data are aggregated, variations at lower levels of aggregation dissolve to form more homogenous areas in terms of population characteristics [17] . With the postal codes aggregated to counties and states, the variability in seroprevalence estimates evident at the scale of postal code and counties likely diminished as the seroprevalence estimates were averaged (Table 1(b) ). Generally, spatial aggregation is expected to increase spatial correlations [38] . However, in this study the opposite effect was observed, and the spatial autocorrelation present at postal and county levels disappeared at state level. This may imply that the biological processes which are associated with the clustering of infected cats at local levels (i.e., postal codes and counties) become irrelevant or unobservable at higher aggregation levels (i.e., states). It is important to note that there is a random aspect to the effects of the MAUP and it may be difficult to generalize about how different datasets with different spatial units are affected by the MAUP [15] . Furthermore, the aggregation process itself may induce positive spatial autocorrelation, particularly if the aggregation process allows overlapping units [15] such as postal code to form counties. Unfortunately, not all postal code areas or counties in the US and Canada were sampled for this study and Moran's test was based on a neighbourhood specification of three nearest neighbours. Therefore it is possible to get \"first three nearest neighbours\" areas too distant from a biological perspective on infection, which would tend to aggravate variability and reduce autocorrelation at lower levels of aggregation. Evidence of high-risk areas for FIV and FeLV infections as detected by the spatial scan test adjusted for known confounders suggests that yet unknown spatial factors may exist. This study also indicates that the results from the spatial scan test can be influenced by spatial aggregation as evident from the difference in size, number, and location of clusters for both FIV and FeLV infections. Despite differences in cluster characteristics with respect to size and location across aggregation levels for FeLV, no clusters were detected in the western parts of United States and Canada indicating that these areas had lower prevalence of infection compared to the rest of the study area. The results at county and postal code area levels were similar with respect to cluster size and locations. The sampled counties and postal codes were not very different with respect to population characteristics and thus may be insensitive to aggregation effects. However, it is most likely an artificial effect as most counties had only a few postal codes sampled within them. While multiple clusters were detected for FIV at the postal code level, these were not detected at higher aggregation levels (Figures 1(a)-1(c) ). Spatial aggregation reduced the sample size from 641 postal codes to 346 counties and 49 states (or provinces) in this study. Aggregation of data may smooth out local effects but may also lead to reduced power to detect small clusters while stabilizing rates that may be unstable in smaller areas due to smaller at-risk-populations in the denominator [39, 40] .",

This is expected since both infections share similar risk factors [42] and as a result would have similar infection rates. Furthermore, the seroprevalence of FeLV in an area was negatively associated with a higher proportion of young cats, indoor cats, and neutered males. Consequently, the seroprevalence would be higher in areas with greater proportions of adults, outdoor cats, and intact cats due to social interactions related to roaming, breeding, and fighting. Therefore, the areas populated with cats of these characteristics can be expected to harbour cats with higher risk of acquiring retroviral infections. Areas with greater proportions of intact female cats had a lower seroprevalence for FIV than areas with greater proportions of spayed female cats. This finding seems to be counterintuitive from a biological perspective, as similar to areas with greater proportions of intact males; populations with greater proportions of intact females might be expected to be more susceptible to acquire an infection as a result of higher probabilities of animals fighting. However, the predictors that are derived variables (variables constructed as summaries of individual characteristics) in the group level analysis cannot distinguish the individual-level effect of the variable from its contextual or group level effect [43] . Derived variables are constructed mathematically by summarizing the individual characteristics in a group [43] , for example, proportion of males in an area.",

Except for FIV and FeLV seroprevalence, this study did not identify any covariate consistently associated with the outcome across all three aggregation levels. The geographic scales on which these two variables are meaningful factors probably include scales larger than postal code. This is likely true, since veterinary clinics generally service areas that overlap several postal code areas or occasionally across county barriers. For other variables, the choice of the aggregation scale seems to affect the significance and magnitude of observed associations. Generally, most of the predictor variables were only significant at lower levels of aggregation. Suggesting that seroprevalence of FIV and FeLV at higher levels of aggregation depend on further grouplevel factors not considered in this study. It is important that this spatial scale dependence is not overinterpreted as a sole MAUP effect as multivariable analysis is a complex subject and nevertheless can be prone to missing but confounding variables [16] . This study utilized an ecological regression framework based on covariates as derived variables from individual level data [44] .
