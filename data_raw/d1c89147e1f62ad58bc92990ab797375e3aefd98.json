There are currently no licensed medical interventions (drugs, other therapeutics or vaccines) available to treat or prevent ZIKV infection and the development of severe disease. The wide cross reactivity among different flavivirus 6 and the risk associated with the antibody dependent enhancement 7 strongly request the identification of protective and pathogenetic immune signature to ZIKV.",

Nevertheless, an unbalanced immunoactivation with high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the cerebrospinal fluid has been associated to encephalomyelitis 11 . Although the main role played by humoral response 12 , an involvement of CD8 T cell response in the protection against ZIKV infection has been recently suggested in a mouse model of ZIKV infection 13 . Moreover, the activation of T-cells and their Th1 polarization has been also recently demonstrated in mice 14 .

A significant difference among HD, ZIKV and DENV was observed in the activation profile of CD8 (KW < 0.05) and of CD4 T cells (KW < 0.05). Specifically, when compared to HD, a higher frequency of CD38 pos and of CD38 pos /HLA-DR pos CD8 T-cells was observed both in ZIKV and in DENV patients (Fig. 2a) . Moreover, a significant higher frequency of CD38 neg /HLA-DR pos CD8 T-cells was observed in ZIKV-patients than in HD (Fig. 2a) . CD4 T-cells showed a lower level of activation than CD8 T-cells both in ZIKV and DENV patients but CD38 pos CD4 T-cells were significantly higher in ZIKV and DENV than in HD (Fig. 2c) . Although a trend of CD38 increase on DN T cells during DENV infection, no significant difference was observed on the activation of DN T-cells among HD, ZIKV and DENV, probably due to the small sample size (Fig. 2e) . The analysis of CD8 T-cells did not show any difference on the differentiation profile between ZIKV, DENV and HD (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, a significant difference was observed in the differentiation profile of CD4 (KW < 0.05) and DN (KW < 0.05) T-cells. In particular, ZIKV patients showed a lower frequency of CM-CD4 T-cells in comparison to both HD and DENV patients, and a parallel higher frequency of EM-CD4 T-cells and TEMRA-CD4 T-cells in ZIKV respect to HD (Fig. 3c) . Similar results were obtained by analysing DN T-cells: indeed, a lower frequency of CM-DN T-cells was observed in ZIKV in comparison to both HD and DENV patients and a parallel higher frequency of TEMRA-DN T-cells in ZIKV respect to HD (Fig. 3e) . Finally, an inverse correlation between days after symptoms onset and EM CD8 T-cell frequency was observed (Pearson R: \u22120.76, R Squared 0.58, p = 0.04).",

The analysis of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T-cells revealed a significant difference among HD, ZIKV and DENV (KW < 0.05).

Nevertheless, an excessive T-cell activation observed during severe viral diseases such as severe DENV 15 or Ebola viral (EBOV) infection [16] [17] [18] may be harmful to the host, by increasing inflammation and promoting anergy of protective T-cells. We found that ZIKV infection induced a significant activation of CD8 and CD4 T-cells, confirming recent data obtained in mice 14 . The frequency of CD8 T-cells co-expressing both CD38 and HLA-DR was similar in ZIKV and in DENV patients 15 , but was lower than during EBOV infection 16, 18 , suggesting that a moderate activation may be associated to a protective activity and to a mild profile of the disease. In acute infection such as of DENV 19 or Ebola virus [16] [17] [18] , the activation of T-cells is associated to an increased expression of apoptotic markers.

Other study are necessary to deeply explore the functional properties of effector CD4 T-cells. An effector phenotype of T-cells was also described in the mouse model of ZIKV infection 14 . Nevertheless, although the expression of an effector phenotype, a significant reduction of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 T-cells was observed respect to both HD and DENV patients. Was can speculate that CD4 T-cells during Zika infection were polarized to produce cytokine and chemokines other than IFN-\u03b3. The ability of ZIKV to inhibit Type-I IFNs production and response was reported 9, 20 but the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 production by T-cells represent a new finding whose role in the context of protection/pathogenesis needs further investigations. No differences in the frequency of IL-2 and IL-17-producing CD4 and CD8 T-cells was observed, suggesting that ZIKV did not modify the ability of T-cells to produce these cytokines that indeed were found higher in the sera of ZIKV patients 10 .",

            "text": "The current study reports for the first time a substantial expansion of V\u03b42 T-cells during ZIKV infection, that was more pronounced during the first days from symptoms onset. Expanded V\u03b42 T-cells presented an effector phenotype and expressed granzyme B. A pillar role of V\u03b42 T-cells in a well orchestrated immune response to viral infection is well documented 21 . Indeed, human \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells may affect the progression and outcome of infectious diseases 22, 23 . Activated V\u03b42 T-cells are able to exert direct antiviral activities and to perform several stimulatory activities on both innate and adaptive immune cells [24] [25] [26] [27] . Several reports suggest a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells during other acute viral infections 22, 23, [28] [29] [30] . \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells expand quickly in response to WNV infection, produce significant amount of IFN-\u03b3, limiting the viral load and protecting the host from lethal encephalitis 29, 30 . We could not directly correlate the V\u03b42 T-cell expansion with a protective effect during ZIKV infection, since all the patients included in this study showed a mild clinical course of the disease and no sequelae were observed. A direct comparison between severe and mild diseases may be helpful in supporting a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells during ZIKV infection. The analysis of V\u03b42 T-cells may also be important to better understand the pathogenesis associated with severe clinical complications of ZIKV infection such as microcephaly in foetuses 2, 3 and/or Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults 31 . Interestingly, an expansion of V\u03b42 T-cells has been associated with recurrent abortions 32, 33 . Furthermore, the Th1 profile of expanded V\u03b42 T-cells might contribute to placenta damage and/or inflammation that has been correlated with foetal brain damage during ZIKV infection 34 . Finally, \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells may play a role during autoimmune diseases 35 and in particular during Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome [36] [37] [38] , contributing to autoimmune damage. Table 1 . The serological and virological data are reported in Table 2 . Elispot assay. T-cell functionality during Zika acute infection was assessed by detecting interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISpot) after PHA stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 2 mmol/liter L-glutamine) and assessed for vitality by Trypan Blue exclusion, counted, and plated at 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ well in ELISpot plates (AID GmbH, Strabberg, Germany). PBMCs were then stimulated with PHA, included in the Elispot kit, for 24 hours with 5% of CO 2 . At the end of incubation, the ELISpot assay was developed according to manufacturer's instructions. Spontaneous cytokine production (background) was assessed by incubating PBMC with 1 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1CD28 and \u03b1CD49d (IgG1, clones CD28.2 and 9f10, respectively; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Results are expressed as spot forming cells (SFC)/10 6 PBMCs in stimulating cultures after subtracting spontaneous background. ",

Cryopreserved PBMC were rapidly thawed, washed with PBS 1X and analyzed by flow cytometry using the following anti-human monoclonal antibodies to assess T-cell subsets, and T-cell activation, differentiation and functional profile: CD4 V450 (Clone RPA-T4), CD8 APC H7 (Clone SK1), CD8 Pe Cy 7 (Clone RPA T8), CD3 PerCp Cy 5.5 (Clone SP 34-2), CD3 FITC (Clone UCHT1), CD3 V500 (Clone UCHT1), CD27 APC H7 (Clone M-T271), CD38 APC (Clone HIT2), HLA-DR PerCp (Clone L243), V\u03b42 TCR PE (Clone B6), INF-\u03b3 PE-Cy 7 (Clone B27), V\u03b42 TCR FITC (Clone B6), Granzyme -B AlexaFLUOR647 (Clone GB11), CD45 AmCyan (Clone 2D1), purchased from BD Pharmigen; CD45RA PerCp-Vio 700 (Clone REA 562), IL 2 APC (Clone N7.48 A), purchased from Macs Miltenyi Biotec; TCR Delta TC\u03b41 FITC (Clone TS-1), purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific; CD56 (Clone N 901), purchased from Beckman Coulter; and finally, IL-17A PE (Clone eBio64CAP17), purchased from Affymetrix eBioscience. Briefly, 5 \u00d7 10 5 PBMC were incubated for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C with the indicated mAbs. After washing (PBS/1%BSA/0.1% sodium azide), samples were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and immediately acquired using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer. The general gating strategy was: FSC-A v. SSC-A > CD3pos > CD4 pos or CD8 pos or CD4 negCD8 neg cells. The activation analysis was performed by analyzing CD38 and HLA-DR expression on i) CD4 pos, ii) CD8 pos and iii) CD4 negCD8 neg cells. The differentiation profile was performed by analyzing CD27 and CD45RA on i) CD4 pos, ii) CD8 pos and iii) CD4 negCD8 neg cells. The gating strategy for the analysis of CD3posCD4 negCD8 neg cells was: FSC-A v. SSC-A > CD3pos > CD4 negCD8 neg cells > V\u03b41 or V\u03b42 or CD56. The gating strategy for the analysis of V\u03b42 T cells was: FSC-A v. SSC-A > CD3pos > V\u03b42 T cells > Granzyme B. Positive gates were selected on the basis of isotype matched controls. Results are shown as Box and Whiskers: the box encompasses the interquartile range of individual measurements, the horizontal bar-dividing line indicates the median value, and the whiskers represent maximum and minimum values.",
