Among the different inflammatory products, macrophage-derived foam cells and smooth muscle cells synthesize matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), playing a pivotal role in early plaque formation and enlargement. We found increased levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 in human endarterectomies with advanced atherosclerosis, together with significant amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) metalloproteinase inducer EMMPRIN. To test whether the absence of NO may aggravate atherosclerosis through EMMPRIN activation, double NOS3/apoE knockout (KO) mice expressed high levels of EMMPRIN in carotid plaques, suggesting that targeting extracellular matrix degradation may represent a new mechanism by which endothelial NO prevents atherosclerosis. Based on our previous experience, by using gadolinium-enriched paramagnetic fluorescence micellar nanoparticles conjugated with AP9 (NAP9), an EMMPRIN-specific binding peptide, magnetic resonance sequences allowed non-invasive visualization of carotid EMMPRIN in NOS3/apoE over apoE control mice, in which atheroma plaques were significantly reduced. Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN as a new therapeutic target of NO-mediated protection against atherosclerosis, and NAP9 as a non-invasive molecular tool to target atherosclerosis.",

EMMPRIN is a glycoprotein that regulates MMP expression in several cell types, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, macrophages and cardiac myocytes. Activation of EMMPRIN requires its glycosylation for a correct protein trafficking to the cell surface, and forming oligomers [7] which bind to its ligand Cyclophilin A (CyPA) [8] . Elevated levels of circulating CyPA are detected under oxidative stress, hypoxia, and inflammation, facilitating the formation of CyPA/EMMPRIN complexes during the onset of acute myocardial infarction [8] and atherosclerosis. The CyPA/EMMPRIN complex leads to platelet activation, adhesion, thrombus formation [9] , and foam cell differentiation [10] , playing a critical role in plaque progression and vulnerability [11] . Therefore, targeting EMMPRIN may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to promote cardiovascular protection.",

A linear regression analysis detected a positive correlation between NAP9 uptake with ex vivo measurement of EMMPRIN in carotid sections from the same mice ( Figure 4C ; R = 0.757, P: 0.011), suggesting that NAP9 nanoparticles may represent a new tool for non-invasive targeting of atherosclerosis in vivo.

During atherosclerosis, EMMPRIN plays a key role in foam cell and plaque formation [9, 26] , and here we found that NO plays a pivotal role in controlling EMMPRIN-dependent carotid atherosclerosis. The use of antibody-mediated targeting of proteins have been evaluated [27] . However, few human studies were undertaken for reasons that include immune cross reactivity, antibody-mediated side effects, or lack of therapeutic improvement. To avoid undesired side effects, we and others used smaller binding molecules to the target of interest, including specific binding peptides [15, 28] . To our knowledge, we were pioneers in using specific EMMPRIN-binding peptides in preclinical animal models of acute myocardial infarction, since they were tested in 293 cells [29] , THP-1 cells [30] , and in peripheral blood monocyte cell cultures [31] .",

We targeted here the expression of EMMPRIN in carotid atherosclerosis, providing evidence that the use of non-invasive strategies with theranostic potential, narrowing specific molecules involved in atherosclerosis like EMMPRIN, may have a significant impact when it comes to future improvement in the precision of diagnostic and management of coronary artery diseases, including coronary atheroma plaque vulnerability or acute coronary syndrome, with promising implications in the future of clinical practice focused on the prevention, diagnostic and follow up progression of disease.",

Limitations of the study may include the use of male younger mammary arteries as controls in the human analysis of carotid endarterectomies, and the animal model itself, since human and mouse arteries and atheroma plaque composition differ from each other. Therefore, further studies in porcine models of carotid atherosclerosis will be crucial for future testing in humans.",
