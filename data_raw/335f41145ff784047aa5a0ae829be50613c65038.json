            "text": "This research examines whether maternal optimism/pessimism is associated with unplanned Cesarean section deliveries in China. If so, does the association remain after controlling for clinical factors associated with C-sections? A sample of 227 mostly primiparous women in the third trimester of pregnancy was surveyed in a large tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Postdelivery data were collected from medical records. In bivariate analysis, both optimism and pessimism were related to unplanned c-section. However, when optimism and pessimism were entered into a regression model together, optimism was no longer statistically significant. Pessimism remained significant, even when adjusting for clinical factors such as previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, infant gestational age, infant birthweight, labor duration, birth complications, and selfrated difficulty of the pregnancy. This research suggests that maternal mindset during pregnancy has a role in mode of delivery. However, more research is needed to elucidate potential causal pathways and test potential interventions.",

Numerous researchers have investigated the predictors of higher than normal cesarean section rates [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Principal among these include including physician-related factors, insurancerelated factors, hospital and health-system factors, and maternal preferences. Additionally, cesarean section rates have also been found to vary by male versus female provider [15] , public versus private hospital setting [16] [17] [18] [19] , adoption and use of clinical guidelines [20] , public versus private insurance status [18] , and even day of the week and time of day [17, 19, 21] that women present for delivery. Patient race [16] , age [22] , income [22] , and preferences [23] have also been linked to increased c-section rates.",

It is probable that the vast majority of unplanned cesarean sections are attributable to clinical indications. However, are there potential psychological variables at play as well? And in a country like China, with exceedingly high rates of cesarean section, might the impact of those psychological variables be observable?",

Dispositional optimism is seen as a relatively stable personality characteristic (a \"trait\" rather than a \"state\") that is associated with general assumptions about positive future outcomes. Dispositional pessimism is the converse: it is a tendency to expect the worst when looking toward future outcomes. A meta-analytic review of the optimism literature from 2009 [25] that examined 83 separate studies found a persistent relationship between optimism and positive health outcomes [25] . In addition, women with higher levels of optimism during pregnancy have been found to have to lower levels of stress, anxiety, and peripartum depression than women with lower levels of optimism [26] [27] [28] [29] . Optimism has also been linked to birth outcomes, with one study finding that optimistic women gave birth to larger babies [30] , and a second study finding that when gestational age was controlled for, women who were least optimistic during pregnancy when compared to women with higher levels of optimism delivered smaller infants [31] .",

However, pessimism has been shown to have prophylactic effects in certain circumstances. In particular, pessimism can insulate people from the psychological consequences of failure, including anxiety, depression, and diminished self-esteem [32] . Norem and Cantor [32, 33] found that individuals who expect the worst can sometimes use those expectations to help them better meet the demands of stressful challenges. These \"defensive pessimists\" engage in active and constructive coping efforts-which may mediate the relationship between pessimism and outcomes [34] . For example, Moyer et al. found that among pregnant women in Ghana, those who were the most pessimistic were more likely to get tested for HIV whereas their optimistic counterparts were less likely to get tested [35] .",

The LOT-R has been widely validated [38] and used in China [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . It includes 6 scored items and 4 fillers that generate an overall score, as well as two possible subscales: an optimism subscale and a pessimism subscale. The items that make up the optimism subscale are (1) in uncertain times, I usually expect the best; (2) I'm always optimistic about my future and (3) overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad. The items that make up the pessimism subscale are (1) if something can go wrong for me, it will; (2) I hardly ever expect things to go the way I would like them to go; (3) I rarely count on good things happening to me. The participant answers each item based on a 5-point scale, with response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The pessimism items are reverse scored and then added to the optimism items to create the overall score whereas the subscales are created by summing the items for pessimism and the items for optimism separately. For these analyses, the optimism and pessimism subscales were used separately.",

Mean duration of labor-defined as the time from first documentation of regular contractions plus cervical dilation to vaginal delivery-was 9 hours, with a range of 1 to 21 hours. Slightly more than half of women delivered vaginally, with the remaining having planned, emergency, or posttrial-of-labor (PTOL) cesarean sections.

This association was robust enough to remain, even when adjusted for clinical factors likely to be linked to a risk of unplanned cesarean section delivery. Interestingly, pessimism not optimism remained significant throughout the analysis. However, what is not clear, and what the cross-sectional study design of the study does not allow us to explore, is the mechanism of action. What is it about being pessimistic that is related to unplanned c-section delivery? It is possible that pessimists have qualitatively different or less effective coping skills than their less pessimistic counterparts [47] [48] [49] [50] . Additionally pessimists, by virtue of believing that negative outcomes are likely, may be more fearful during labor. Emotional factors such as fear of delivery or fear of pain [51] have been linked to increased risk of c-section. Pessimists may also be more likely than their optimistic counterparts to abandon a traditional vaginal delivery and opt for a csection if given the opportunity. Conceivably pessimism may serve as a proxy for another latent variable. Previous studies have linked optimism and pessimism to age, spirituality, and even SES, [52] [53] [54] but an additional, as yet undescribed and measured variable could explain the relationship between pessimism and unplanned cesarean section rates.",
