Where formal address networks do not exist, tracking spatial patterns of clinical disease is difficult. Geolocation strategies were tested at rural health facilities in western Kenya. Methods included geocoding residence by head of compound, participatory mapping and recording the self-reported nearest landmark. Geocoding was able to locate 72\u00b79% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67\u00b77-77\u00b76] of individuals to within 250 m of the true compound location. The participatory mapping exercise was able to correctly locate 82\u00b70% of compounds (95% CI 78\u00b79-84\u00b78) to a 2 \u00d7 2\u00b75 km area with a 500 m buffer. The self-reported nearest landmark was able to locate 78\u00b71% (95% CI 73\u00b78-82\u00b71) of compounds to the correct catchment area. These strategies tested provide options for quickly obtaining spatial information on individuals presenting at health facilities.",

Outbreaks of (emerging) infectious diseases may be geographically confined or start in small pockets that later give rise to larger outbreaks [1] [2] [3] [4] . For endemic infectious diseases with stable disease transmission, considerable geographical heterogeneity in the intensity of transmission has been described [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] . Geographical variation for both epidemic and endemic infectious disease occurrence has important public health consequences. Identifying regions with higher disease burden can facilitate costeffective prioritization of control efforts [9] [10] [11] . Within regions, identifying areas of persistent and intense transmission may prevent outbreaks of disease that spread from these areas and support disease elimination strategies when overall disease occurrence has declined [2, 12, 13] . To allow spatial targeting of disease control efforts, attributing a geographical location to each disease occurrence is ideal, and the minimum number required for accurate monitoring is likely to be disease specific [9, 14, 15] .",

In circumstances where formal address data are unavailable or privacy concerns limit the use of precise spatial locations, other approaches have been used to obtain geographical information on incident cases. Catchment areas of, for example, community pharmacies or general practitioners have been used for describing spatial patterns in disease occurrence [6, 15, [20] [21] [22] . In areas with well-developed public health infrastructure, catchment areas tend to be well defined and sufficiently small to allow a meaningful attribution of localities to clinical cases based on the facility they attended [20, 22] . Geolocation approaches are likely to have less utility for resource-poor settings where formal address systems are commonly unavailable and where health-facility catchment areas are relatively large and poorly defined [5, 23, 24] . Alternative approaches to geolocation strategies are needed in such settings.",

Four of the five health facilities were sampled during both surveys. One facility was replaced for the second year to maximize overlap with the ongoing community work. All patients and accompanying individuals attending the outpatient clinic were recruited for the survey. A questionnaire was administered to all consenting participants to obtain information on malaria indicators and their area of residence, as described below. Tracing individual compounds from health-facility attendees is a laborious and costly exercise because of the large catchment areas and inaccessible terrain and could therefore not be completed for all attendees.

Each block comprised 20 'cells', each measuring 500 \u00d7 500 m. Each block/cell combination was given a unique numeric identifier. The system (including size of polygon) was selected because it was familiar to the field workers and would provide them a better frame of reference for facilitating the exercise. As part of the participant questionnaire, the interviewer would explain the main features of the satellite map and with the participant, would attempt to locate the residence on the map and record the corresponding cell identifier. Due to the spatial resolution required to locate compounds, this approach is most applicable to local scale but could be scaled up if satellite imagery was indexed into a book-format instead of a poster.",

Roads and rivers in the study area were digitized using highresolution Quickbird satellite multispectral imagery at 2\u00b78 m resolution sharpened with a 60 cm resolution panchromatic image. Roads were classified into four categories: (1) tarred roads where the likely maximum speed is 80 km/h; (2) roads that are not tarred but where vehicles travel at a likely maximum speed of 40 km/h; (3) roads that are not tarred but accessible to a vehicle or motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 20 km/h; (4) paths not likely traversed by a vehicle but by motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 10 km/h. For all other surfaces, including walking paths or fields, a maximum speed of 5 km/h was assumed [23] . Rivers were classified as barriers to movement except where they were intersected by a road or path.

Although strategies are not directly comparable due to the different spatial scales, the current study showed that there are options available to obtain spatial information in areas where no formal postal network exists. Results have shown that it was possible to correctly locate close to 80% of participant compounds using either a participatory mapping exercise (to 2 \u00d7 2\u00b75 km blocks with buffer) or by using information about the nearest primary school. This is similar to the level of detection of most geocoding strategies when applied in developed countries, although the spatial resolution is not as good [17, 32] .

The geocoding approach requires that an accurate and up-to-date list of names of compound heads is available, which is unlikely to be the case outside areas of active community-based research. The geocoding approach also relies on names recorded being complete and recorded consistently; a difficult task in busy facilities. There may also be challenges in obtaining correct information from people who may want to remain anonymous. Moreover, a systematic bias is inevitable as compounds whose head has a common name or is the head of multiple compounds will never be matched unless other variables are also considered.

Edge effect will always be an important limitation that must be accounted for in any application of this methodology particularly when the focus is on locating residences at a precise spatial resolution. However, despite this limitation, this research has provided important insight into how the edge effect can be minimized and sensitivity increased by the addition of buffer zones. Other approaches could have been used including a hexagonal grid or larger clusters as was used in the study in Blantyre's urban slum area [25] . These approaches will likely reduce, but not completely eliminate the edge effect. Moreover, in this study, there was a significant difference in the proportion of people correctly located at each health facility and not every participant was willing to complete the exercise. This suggests that the familiarity of the interviewers with the area, their ability to read and explain the maps to local populations, and the time they have or choose to dedicate may be important determinants for success.",

In this study, people only correctly located the nearest landmark around 80% of the time and the accuracy of this approach was dependent on the definition of catchment area used. The reporting bias may be due to factors such as spatial perceptions of 'closeness', the density of that type of landmark in the area, or reporting known or highly frequented landmarks rather than those that are closer. Other possible landmarks that could be used include nearest chief or assistant chief, nearest shop, or nearest local transport point. In terms of defining catchment areas, both methods produced similar results [36] . The analysis using the cost-distance catchment areas showed a lower error rate based on the distance from the edge of the catchment area suggesting that this approach may be more robust.

Conversely, if the distribution of sexually transmitted infections was being studied, less precision may be acceptable or even necessary to guarantee anonymity [20] . Second, the ideal strategy will depend on the purpose of geolocating cases. If it is for programmatic use such as passive public health surveillance, or to establish disease distribution at a regional or national level, then using the nearest health facility, with a larger mean catchment area may be sufficient. However, if greater precision and accuracy were required, for identification of foci for disease elimination or identifying where to implement control, for example, then knowing the exact boundaries of the catchment area or having a comprehensive postal network that can be geocoded to a high precision would be essential.",

Although this provided a large sample, it is possible that if we could have traced all individuals, the results and the conclusions on the applicability of the techniques tested may have been different. However, as the sample was a random selection, the impact on the results is expected to be minimal. Similarly, spatial coordinates were only available for the government-run primary schools in the area, thereby restricting the sample to those residing near these schools. The limited number of school locations that were available as well as the lack of covariates such as size or perception of academic rigour to include as part of delineation of catchment areas likely influenced the size of catchment areas as calculated by both approaches. However, although altered catchment area boundaries would impact both the precision and accuracy of the results, this is not likely to have a significant impact of the results.",

However, the ability to efficiently geolocate individuals residing in areas where no formal address network exists or where the settlement pattern is not conducive to matching individuals to specific localities is currently lacking, particularly in areas around the world where infectious disease transmission persists [5, 38] . The geolocation strategies tested as part of this research exemplify alternative options for obtaining spatial information from health-facility patients in a setting that is typical for much of rural sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world. Easily collected spatial information can supplement both passive and active disease surveillance to detect foci of transmission, enables the detection of outbreaks in a timely manner, and facilitates tracking of how disease spreads through the population over time [37, 39, 40] . If validated in other parts of the world, these results indicate that recording the nearest primary school or implementation of a participatory mapping exercise at rural health facilities offer potential strategies to facilitate spatial analysis of disease dynamics. Further research is needed to demonstrate their utility in a range of settings and their operational viability before formal testing in a broader operational context.",
