New IBV TW-like strains have increasingly emerged in China in recent years; hence, evaluating their pathogenicity and developing a specific vaccine to guard against their potential threat to the poultry industry is important. Here, we examined the pathogenicity of a TW-like IBV strain (GD), and evaluated the protective efficacy of the QX-like strain (JS) against GD in challenge infections in chickens. The results revealed that strain-GDinfected birds experienced severe respiratory signs, renal lesions, and 30-40% mortality. The GD virus had extensive tissue tropism, especially in the trachea, lungs, kidneys, and bursa of Fabricius, and was continuously shed via the respiratory tract and cloaca. The QX-like IBV strain JS is able to completely protect chickens from challenge with the TW-like IBV GD field strain, with no clinical signs or gross lesions, decreased tissue replication rates, lower ciliostasis score, and reduced virus shedding. These findings indicate that IBV GD is highly virulent, and that QX-like JS may serve as an effective vaccine against the threat posed by IBV TW-like viruses.",

However, effective vaccination is undermined by rapidly acquired genetic changes in IBV (e.g., gene insertion, mutation, deletion, and reconstruction; Dolz et al., 2008; Kuo et al., 2010) . Additionally, immunity against IBV affords a low degree of cross protection between different IBV serotypes (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975) , thus confirming the results of molecular epidemiology studies on IBV Li et al., 2012) . Because of the inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination, the emergence of new variant strains, genotypes, and serotypes of IBV is continuously reported (Cavanagh et al., 1986) . Existing vaccines for IB no longer provide protection and they tend to be ineffective against the epidemic IBV strains when new variant IBV isolates emerge or when new serotypes appear . Therefore, screening new live-attenuated vaccine strains based on new isolates is necessary to protect chickens against the common epidemic IBV strains.",

            "text": "Despite the various live-attenuated and inactivated IBV vaccines derived from large numbers of genetically distinct strains in widespread use across the world, IB outbreaks still occur sporadically because there is little or no cross protection between the different IBV serotypes and new variants constantly appear (Cook et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2015) . Once a new epidemic serotype appears, the protection provided by the existing vaccine strains will greatly decline. The emergence of TW-like strains has been increasing and spreading widely in China during recent years and these TW-like isolates are distantly related to the predominant H120 vaccine and other prevalent strains (Xu et al., 2016) . In this study, we determined the pathogenicity of the TW-like IBV strain GD and evaluated the protective efficacy induced by experimental infections with the QX-like JS strain. The TW-like IBV GD strain was highly pathogenic in SPF chickens, inflicting 100% morbidity and 30-40% mortality. IBV GD caused pale and swollen kidneys, and the renal tubules and ureters were distended with urates. The gross lesions and histopathological changes caused by the GD strain were similar to those described in a report on nephropathogenic IBV strains (Boroomand et al., 2012) , thus characterizing GD as a nephropathogenic IBV strain. Additionally, a proportion of the dead chickens in the challenge infection group showed heavy mucus exudates or atrophy in the bursa of Fabricius, a finding similar to the results obtained for other field strains in several previously studies (Toro et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2012) . More works need to be performed to clarify this and explore its influence on chickens.",
