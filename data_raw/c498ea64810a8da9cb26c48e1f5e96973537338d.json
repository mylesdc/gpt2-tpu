During 2000During -2005, five dog and one human rabies cases were imported into France, a rabies-free country since 2001.

We investigated medical practice evolution following the official elimination of rabies in 2001; impact of subsequent episodic rabies importations and national newspaper coverage on demand for and delivery of antirabies prophylaxis; regular transmission of epidemiological developments within the French Antirabies Medical Center (ARMC) network; and ARMC discussions on indications of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP).",

Autoregressive integrated movingaverage modeling and regression with autocorrelated errors were applied to examine how 2000-2005 episodic rabies events and their related national newspaper coverage affected demand for and delivery of RPEP. A slight, continuous decline of rabies-dedicated public health facility attendance was observed from 2000 to 2004. Then, during the Summer 2004 event, patient consultations and RPEP and ARIG prescriptions increased by 84%, 19.7% and 43.4%, respectively.

In Western Europe, rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals was a well-known illness that has now become a rare disease, because many countries have succeeded in eradicating it. The major risk of rabies is now due to translocation of infected animals, mainly dogs, from rabies-enzootic areas and humans with rabies infection acquired abroad [8] . Although untreated rabies is invariably fatal, death can be avoided by proper administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis (RPEP), e.g., antirabies vaccine, with or without antirabies immunoglobulins (ARIG), before disease onset [6] . Thus, rapid identification of individuals potentially exposed to rabies is critical and media alerts can be extremely useful to identify people who were in contact with the rabid animal.",

RPEP is administered, predominantly according to the Zagreb schedule, to people bitten by an animal suspected of being infected with rabies or exposed to its saliva. Clinicians conduct a risk assessment for each exposed patient, and decide to administer RPEP according to the general recommendations, epidemiological data and grade of the bite [9] . The French network for rabies prophylaxis provides exhaustive national data collected by ARMC [10] , and laboratory diagnoses of humans suspected of having rabies [11] and animals suspected contaminating humans. From 1968 to 1998, a period during which rabies was endemic in French foxes, more than 45,600 animals were diagnosed as rabid. In 2001, France was declared free of rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals based on World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) criteria and, as a consequence, the number of RPEP began to decline progressively.",

Because several known events could have affected the series, a step-by-step procedure was undertaken [15, 16] .

To complete this plan, temporary licensing of a multidose vaccine (Verorab, Sanofi Pasteur) was accorded and ARIG injections were postponed, as necessary, in accordance with WHO guidelines [12] . Unfortunately, it was not feasible to quantitatively analyze the extent of that adaptation. However, RPEP and ARIG never became completely unavailable. Notably, the risk of a potential ARIG shortage in the event of an unplanned increase of demand or a limitation of supply is shared by many countries in Europe and on other continents [30, 31] .",

National and local authorities coordinated several news conferences and newspaper reports to inform the French Rabies Reemergence and Antirabies Prophylaxis www.plosntds.org population about the risk and recommendations concerning errant dogs in general, and how to react to potential exposure to a rabid dog. A European-wide alert was launched through the European warning and response system. Second, beginning in early September 2004, this intensive communication frenzy of 54 newspaper articles heightened public awareness of the rabies risk. Third, additional public concern might also have been heightened by controversies surrounding the crisis management. Notably, event #6 occurred just before the annual opening of hunting season, in a strongly traditional hunting region. An initial decision was made to forbid hunting with dogs in the counties where the rabid dog had traveled during his infectious period. That restriction led to a passionate public debate, angering hunters and ending with hunting organizations successfully blocking the ban. Fourth, public health authorities decided to eradicate freeroaming dogs. Finally, press releases issued by the Minister of Rural Affairs and the MOH were contradictory concerning the implementation of mandatory antirabies vaccination of dogs and cats.",

In response to national newspaper coverage, people who are far from the event location can become concerned and start taking precautions as if they were in the affected area [3, 4, 32] . This phenomenon is particularly well illustrated by event #6, for which exposure dates reported by patients consulting at AMRC in areas 1 and 2 corresponded to the period of newspaper coverage rather than to the risk-oftransmission period during the dog's movements.",

Outbreaks of emerging and/or deadly infections, like severe acute respiratory syndrome [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] , anthrax [39, 40] and rabies (herein), have shown that media messages dramatically influence both the public's and health-care workers' perceptions of the risk with potential implications for health-care resources. Our observations underscore to what extent, under such circumstances, public health decision-makers have to anticipate the depth and scope of potential consequences of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and their related press communications, and the need to prepare appropriate responses to keep the public health organization effective. It also illustrated that, despite communication efforts implemented by the French public health authorities and messages released through the ARMC network, long-term modifications of ARMC activities and prescriptions were observed, further emphasizing that a post-crisis communication strategy is essential.",

Furthermore, public health crises, e.g. that generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome, demonstrated how conflicting messages can create confusion and uncertainty in both the media and the general public[21]. However, this event #6 newspaper coverage, initiated and promoted by public health authorities, reached its primary and immediate objective, e.g., no secondary dog or human rabies case was reported following the dog's arrival in France. Eight of the 13 identified individuals, who had been exposed to the rabid dog, were located and contacted and 49 dogs and 8 cats identified as having been in direct contact with the event #6 dog were killed. We would have expected this unusual news coverage of a rabies event to have raised public awareness about the risks of illegally importing animals from endemic countries. Between 2000 and 2005, France was the only rabies-free European country to have so many imported cases. Unfortunately, in 2007-2008, two new dog-importation episodes were reported in France, clearly illustrating the short persistence of this type of information disseminated to the public. Because of one of these events, France lost its rabies-free status according to OIE criteria in 2008.",
