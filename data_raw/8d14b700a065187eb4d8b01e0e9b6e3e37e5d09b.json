            "text": "Predicting RNA secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of RNA. Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 59 to 39 folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.",

We expect the reported structure to be the most stable. However, the clear imino-proton signal is consistent with either structure and much of the cleavage data appears to fit either structure. Perhaps developing a more detailed approach to analyzing the local structure and fine tuning of the parameterizations will favor the reported structure. An alternative structure is also shown for the case where a Kuhn length of 4 or 6 is used (Fig. 2a) . This latter structure resembles the tandem pseudoknots of TMV. Almost all the viral frame shift sequences we studied appear to have a fairly large diversity of structural morphologies. Some of these alternative structures may actually represent alternative states of the structure that are used to decide the frame shift mode.

However, the Flory model [20] and/or the McKenzie-Moore-Domb-Fisher model (Ref. [13] ) becomes important for long compact functional RNA structures where polymer-solvent interactions begin to dominate. In Fig. 2b , the structure is fitted using d = 1.4, c = 1.5 and default parameters for the effective Flory model. The parameter d reflects the extent or weight of the correlation in the polymer chain: a large value for d indicates that the memory of the previous monomer dies off very rapidly and a small value suggests that the information persists in the structure over a much longer distance. The default parameter is d = 2 (the Gaussian distribution). The parameter c scales the volume occupied by a polymer in accordance with a self avoiding random walk [13] . This suggests that long sequences with extended interactions also tend to have more correlation over the entire sequence and the dimensionality may be slightly reduced. Many of these structures fold correctly with a variety of parameter values, but long sequences appear to favor smaller values for d, and c.",

In Fig. 3 , the pseudoknot associated with the alpha operon ribosome binding site (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ Rfam/getacc?RF00140) is shown. For a typical Kuhn length of 7 or 8 nt, the structure takes a form shown in Fig. 3a . This occurs for many of these sequences. The reported structure is obtained when we force open the large loop structure shown in Fig. 3b [21] .When forced in this way, the structure in Fig. 3b appears to be the minimum free energy. The free energy difference between the two structures is approximately 7 kcal/mol (at 37uC). The reported activation barrier for the two conformations is DH = 12 kcal/mol [21] . Including the entropy contribution from the model, this is approximately the correct order of magnitude. Therefore, this would suggest that in the fast quenching preparation that was used, obtaining a distribution of RNA structures ranging 7 kcal/ mol is not unusual. The ribosome may provide a major part of the binding interaction. Since vsfold5 only predicts the minimum free Second, we find with the use of [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ localization [22] and the Flory model [20] , we can obtain parts of E. coli RNaseP successfully. The actual structure has highly organized coaxial and parallel stem stacking [23] . The S-domain of RNase P can be fit almost perfectly with minimum stem length 3 bp and the [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ option. Other global features of the complete sequence can be obtained with similar parameters as the group I intron. To obtain the whole structure, more consideration for very complex coaxial stacking arrangements and parallel stem construction will be needed to stabilize the known structure. Recent indications are that parallel alignment of stems is rather common in functional RNA [24] . The structural mapping design of vsfold5 permits development of advanced coaxial stacking and parallel stem arrangement in the form of modules and methods.",

The model is consistent with the experimental data and thermodynamics. The unique features of this model are the mapping, its folding strategy, and its ability to explore the role of polymer swelling and globular structure formation within the context of RNA structure. The approach shows that it is possible to develop a calculation approach that accounts for long range interactions and permits the development of modules to address them. Further, if the time window is seen as a progressive process of updating the 39 end with the new structure, the behavior is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] and the contact order model [26] [27] [28] . Very complex secondary structures can be built if the components of the structure can be explained in terms of some recognizable folding pathway.",

Here we express several highlights of the approach. . Some basic concepts of pseudoknot structure and folding that are considered in the vsfold5 algorithm. (a) Basic concept of folding for a core pseudoknot. The stable secondary structure is formed first, followed by addition of stem into the loop. The red region corresponds to the point where the linkage stem forms. (b) Basic concept of folding for an extended pseudoknot. An extended pseudoknot involves the fusing of two independent domains via a small segment of secondary structure. As in (a), this stable secondary structure is formed first, followed by joining the two independent domains into a single domain. (c) Basic concept of an embedded pseudoknot. Here, the secondary structure naturally permits a multibranch loop to form, and the extended pseudoknot that links two branches of the secondary structure is shown here in thermodynamic equilibrium with the standard secondary structure. (d) Basic concept of pleating. The secondary structure (shown above in d), appears to require a very long free strand region (green) to insure that the red segment of secondary structure is formed. However, when this is viewed more three dimensionally, the internal loop permits this structure to fold back on itself and requires a much shorter segment length. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000905.g004",

These have also been referred to as ABACBC PKs, but like the core PKs, extended PKs can be embellished to any extent required (Text S2). A domain of RNA structure consists of a RNA sequence fragment that forms a stable isolated secondary structure independent of the remaining sequence on the 59 and 39 sides of the domain. In this respect, the fragment can be snipped out and folded without major changes happening to the structure. An example of such a domain is shown in Fig. 4b where domain 1 and domain 2 could be snipped out of the sequence and each structure would persist unaffected. When a pseudoknot joins these independent domains, the entire complex becomes a single domain (Fig. 4b) . The approach for extended PKs assumes that evolution has selected domains that are stable when formed during the folding process and do not change significantly even with the addition of pseudoknot interactions. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4b and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] . A pseudoknot becomes part of a subdomain when it is incorporated into other secondary structure (Fig. 4c ).",

(b) Basic concept of folding for an extended pseudoknot. An extended pseudoknot involves the fusing of two independent domains via a small segment of secondary structure. As in (a), this stable secondary structure is formed first, followed by joining the two independent domains into a single domain. (c) Basic concept of an embedded pseudoknot. Here, the secondary structure naturally permits a multibranch loop to form, and the extended pseudoknot that links two branches of the secondary structure is shown here in thermodynamic equilibrium with the standard secondary structure. (d) Basic concept of pleating. The secondary structure (shown above in d), appears to require a very long free strand region (green) to insure that the red segment of secondary structure is formed. However, when this is viewed more three dimensionally, the internal loop permits this structure to fold back on itself and requires a much shorter segment length. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000905.g004",
