We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sexratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor.",

Beyond the simple analysis of the risk factors associated with FIV, this work aims to understand why the variability observed in our disease prevalence data is so large -data on disease prevalence in males exhibited significant extra-Binomial variations. Can we isolate population risk factors that would explain particularly high disease prevalence in some populations? Does the spatial aggregation of populations with high virus prevalence help to explain the variability in disease prevalence? Or, in contrast, is the large variability observed in disease prevalence a natural consequence of the transmissible nature of the virus?",

So the simplest model describes well the data and explains the large variability observed in disease prevalence between cat populations without invoking any risk factor. Finally, we determine confidence intervals for the model parameters. The model is very simple, explains the data well, and hence constitutes an interesting tool for further understanding and control of the spread of FIV in these cat populations. The approach developed here can easily extend to many host-parasite interactions.",

Some unstudied populations may interact with the studied ones (dashed arrows) and are represented by white rectangles. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007377.g001 populations varied from 1.2 to 4 km. The study zone covers a territory of approximately 250 km 2 . In order to delimit the study area, we considered the geographical characteristics that might limit movements between the studied cat populations and those outside of the studied area. The spatial organisation of geographical barriers suggests that the populations may be organized into three distinct metapopulations, with rare contacts between cats of different metapopulations (Fig. 1, grey areas) . At a finer scale, behavioral observations reveal that males can disperse between populations along roads. By adopting a basic assumption that populations are considered connected when they are not too distant from each other (i.e. less than 2 km) and are connected by roads, we propose a connection network between the different populations (see Fig. 1 , solid arrows). Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish a fully isolated perimeter (at least in relation to spread of FIV), so some populations of the study area are in fact connected to unstudied populations ( Fig. 1 , white rectangles -the connections to the study populations are represented by dashed arrows). In particular, Saulxure-Les-Vannes is connected to several study populations. However, it was not considered for sampling because of potential bias due to a cat culling programme there. The village of Sepvigny, which is connected to Champougny, could not be sampled for technical reasons.",

Unsurprisingly, the probability of FIV extinction decreases with increasing external transmission rate (e M ). More interestingly, below a given threshold (here e M = 10 23 ) the distribution of FIV prevalence is not affected by e M , meaning that infrequent infections of FIV from external sources have almost no effect on FIV transmission within already infected populations. Under these circumstances, external infections only affect the frequency of extinction of the virus. Above the threshold, the mean prevalence of FIV increases with e M . Thus, external infections are an important component of FIV transmission, even within already infected populations.",

The p values are rather large (p = 0.02 and p = 0.043), especially considering the large number of tests performed. Unfortunately, we cannot apply a simple Bonferroni correction for multiple tests because of dependence among the different tests performed. Due to the strong correlation between the mean age of males and females, it is not surprising that both variables have the same significant effect on the male-to-female transmission rate. It seems more likely that only one of the two variables has a real biological effect, the effect of the other one being due to correlation. Due to the strong correlation between the two variables, we cannot rule out a role for mean age of males on the male-to-female transmission rate. H neigh e neigh F , respectively). Under these circumstances, we find no significant improvement in the models compared to H 0 (see Table 2 ). In summary, we found two potential risk factors for FIV: the mean ages of males and females that influence the FIV prevalence in females. These two factors are certainly linked because a large correlation exists between the two variables. Yet, considering the number of tests we performed and the relatively high p values we obtained, we cannot exclude the possibility that the simplest model We remove female prevalence data from the analysis because there is no female to male transmission of the virus. We determine the confidence region of the transmission rates b M and e M, of the ''male transmission model'' parameter space for three different values of the proportion of non-captured cats: p NC = 0.30 (Fig. 4a,  b) , p NC = 0.15 and p NC = 0.45 (Fig. 4b) . In Fig. 4b we superimpose these three confidence regions; only showing their boundaries. We conclude that p NC has a slight impact on the edge of the confidence region. If we project the region onto the b M 0 axis we obtain a 95% confidence interval for the male-to-male transmission rate b M ([1. Finally we look at the impact of the external transmission rate e M on FIV spread in already infected populations. We estimate the average size of a population as the mean number of observed males per population multiplied by 1+p NC , which is equal to 21 for p NC = 0.30. We divide the mean number of infected hosts calculated with the model for a population of average size conditioned to FIV non-extinction by the value obtained with the same parameters, but with an external transmission rate a hundred times lower. We denote R as this value minus one",

Which population characteristics correlate with large FIV prevalence and so explain, in part, the variability in FIV prevalence? We found no such factors, except for mean ages. Interestingly, these ages have a negative effect on FIV prevalence in females, despite the accumulation of cases that occurs with age. One possible explanation is that the presence of older territorial males in some populations ensures greater social stability, which decreases the rate of at-risk (mating) contacts. Reversely, a negative correlation between FIV prevalence and age of cats could be due to the additional mortality induced by the virus. However, considering the weak impact of the infection on the lifeexpectancy of individuals, this explanation seems rather implausible to us.",

Since we detected infected cats in 14 out of the 15 populations (and infected males in 13 of them), we can assume regular viral exchange between populations. Previous theoretical studies have shown the importance of the spatial dispersal of the FIV virus between populations [38] . Due to the topographic isolation of our study area, it seems reasonable to assert that viral exchange between the studied populations is primarily responsible for the reintroduction of the virus into populations where it has become extinct. We proposed two different virus dispersal networks between the populations, but neither significantly improved the goodness-of-fit to the observed data. Although our observations are most likely insufficient to capture the exact dispersal network between populations, the networks we analyzed should be quite realistic, because they are consistent with the natural barriers in the study area.",

An analysis of the confidence region of the male transmission parameters shows that the impact of external infections on FIV prevalence within populations is very limited for the smallest values of the external transmission rate (see Fig. 4c ). In this case, the connectivity between populations cannot be revealed by a corresponding correlation in FIV prevalence. In contrast, for the highest values of external transmission rate in the confidence region, we can expect a correlation in FIV prevalence between connected populations. To sum up, the fact that no spatial correlation in FIV prevalence is observed may simply be due to the fact that external infections are relatively rare and thus play almost no role for disease prevalence in already infected populations.",

The main difference between the two approaches, based on binomial and dynamic models, comes from the variability expected by their respective H 0 models, as illustrated in Fig. 3a . Binomial models predict much narrower distributions than dynamic models. The consequence is illustrated in Fig. 4 , where we can see that the simple SI model accounts for the observed variability in FIV prevalence in males for a wide range of parameters. In contrast, the binomial test on the distribution of the infected cats among the 15 populations rejects the global binomial distribution hypothesis (p<0.006). To explain the data with a logistic regression model that assumes binomial distributions, additional risk factors need to be invoked. With dynamic models, risk factors are not required to explain the variability in the male disease prevalence observed here. The implication of that is that bringing evidence for population risk factors in infectious disease requires large sample sizes. In our present case n = 499 is not large enough and further sampling is required to bring evidence of population risk factors for FIV transmission.",

The most important conclusion of the paper, i.e. that dynamic models predict much more variability than models where individuals are independent and hence are sufficient to explain highly variable prevalence data, would remain true for more complex model. Another model assumption is that we neglected the contacts with populations outside the study area (white rectangles in Fig. 1 ). Since we did not find an important effect of the number of infected neighbors on the disease prevalence in populations, we are confident that adding the neglected populations would not deeply affect our results.",

This is not surprising, since experimental results indicate that most of the virus present in the saliva is not infectious [39] , suggesting a weak efficiency in disease transmission [7] . Given the high frequency of fights between males in such populations and the low rate at which males acquire the infection (around once every four years in a hypothetical scenario where all males are infected), our results are consistent with the concept of a low probability of virus transmission from bites [9] .",

Interestingly, the confidence region crosses the X and Y axis (see Fig. 5). This means that even if one of the two rates (b F or e F ) equals zero, then the model can still explain the data.
