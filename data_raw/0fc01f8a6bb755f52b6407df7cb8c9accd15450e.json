Exposure to CII induced the elevation of mRNAs encoding retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1 and \u03b3t, which were abolished by pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists. Furthermore, blocking P2X7R signaling abolished the CII-mediated increase in IL-17A. Blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated pathological changes in ankle joint of the collagen-induced arthritis mice. Thus, we demonstrated a novel function for P2X7R signaling in regulating CII-induced differentiation of Th17 cells. P2X7R signaling facilitates the development of the sophisticated network of DC-derived cytokines that favors a Th17 phenotype.",

The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated ion channel belonging to P2 receptors, and has emerged as a potential site in the regulation of inflammation in RA 21 . Particularly, the P2X7R allows cation passage through the cell to activate the inflammasomes and production of IL-1\u03b2 , which is obligatory for the Th17 development 22, 23 .

As shown in Fig. 8B , significant increases in paw oedema were recorded in CIA mice rather than controls. Histological score calculated from microphotographs was depicted in Fig. 8C . In addition, histological images suggested that CII leaded to severe synovial hyperplasia, bone or cartilage destruction, vascular proliferation and inflammatory cells infiltration (Fig. 8D) . Treatment with P2X7R antagonists was effective in suppressing the severity of arthritis and immune responses to CII. These results suggested that blocking the P2X7R signaling attenuated joint damage of CIA mice in vivo. ",

Extracellular ATP signaling acting through the P2X7R played an important regulatory/modulatory role in the pathogenesis of RA 35 . In RA patients, a high concentration of extracellular ATP is present in the synovial fluid 36 . Expression of P2X7R was higher in monocytes from patients with RA compared with controls 37 . Similarly, we also observed significantly increased P2X7R expression in the RA patients as compared to their normal counterparts. In addition, P2X7R deficiency leads to a lower incidence and lower severity of joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis 38 . Recently, it has become evident that P2X7R is involved in ATP release in many types of cells (astrocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, etc.) 39, 40 , and the release of ATP via the P2X7R is supposed to be an important source of extracellular adenosine 41 . In osteoclasts under normal conditions, efflux via the P2X7R is the primary mechanism for ATP releases 40 . Although exactly how up regulation of the P2X7R mediates ATP release from cells is unclear, a likely mechanism for ATP release is directly through the formation of membrane pores caused by transient activation of the P2X7R.",

Of the antigen-defined models that are based on cartilage proteins, CIA has the shortest duration between immunization and disease manifestation 42 . CII is a major protein in cartilage, the target tissue of RA 42 . The presence of T-cell and B-cell immunity to CII has been well established in the immunopathogenesis of RA [43] [44] [45] . Here, we firstly investigated the role of CII on the ATP release from DCs.

Knowing that involvement of the P2X7R in ATP release has recently been reported in many cell types 48 , we tested the hypothesis that P2X7R function was required for the CII-induced ATP release from DCs. Our data showing that the P2X7R antagonists completely abolished CII-stimulated ATP release suggest that P2X7R mediates ATP release from DCs in response to CII. The effect of apyrase treatment on P2X7R expression strongly suggests a reciprocal relationship between the release of ATP and P2X7R function in response of DCs to CII. It has been reported that sustained stimulation of the P2X7R caused phenotypic changes, membrane permeabilization, and eventually cell death 49 , but we did not observe any significant cytotoxicity up to 24 h of exposure to CII. In particular, P2X7R activation also contributes to the Th17 cell differentiation. Based on these findings, we postulate that P2X7R is involved in the CII-mediated Th17 polarization.",

P2X7R activation enhances the release of Th17-biasing cytokines [50] [51] [52] . Our data add to this observation by showing that stimulation of P2X7R by CII strongly potentiated the production of IL-1\u03b2 , TGF-\u03b2 1, IL-23 and IL-6 mRNA. In the absence of P2X7R signaling, stimulation with CII failed to induce the upregulation of Th17-promoting cytokines in DCs. A previous study showed that stimulation of P2X7R by BzATP caused no influence on the release of L-12p70 53 , and Miller et al. 54 found that absence of P2X7R did not affect IL-12 production. In agreement with these data, we found that CII-stimulated DCs lacking functional P2X7R still possessed the ability to promote the production of IL-12p40 and IL-12p35. In contrast, absence of the P2X7R did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production 54 , different from our findings in the current study. We speculated that different mediums measured in two studies may explain the discrepancy. Notably, the above results indicated that P2X7R was required for CII-induced development of a Th17-promoting rather than a Th1-promoting microenvironment. Interestingly, a study by Vergani et al. 50 found that in vitro genetic upregulation of the P2X7R pathway was shown to stimulate Th1/Th17 cell generation. These findings suggest that there may be different roles of P2X7R for the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells under certain circumstances. Co-culturing system of CD4 + T cell and DCs is widely used to study the mechanisms underlying the polarization of naive CD4 + T cells in vitro 55 . We thus investigated the potential roles of P2X7R on the Th17 cell differentiation in this co-culturing system. Consistent with the mRNA findings, blocking the P2X7R signaling had a similar influence on the cytokine profile in the CII-stimulated coculture supernatant. The ELISA results enhanced our finding that P2X7R was necessary in the CII-mediated Th17 cell differentiation.",

A previous study showed that ATP stimulation strongly induced P2X7R expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels 57 . Subsequently, pores formed in response to P2X7R activation induced additional ATP release, initiating a positive feedback loop 58 . From the results of in vitro experiments, we have found a reciprocal relationship between ATP release and P2X7R function in response to CII, by which CII-induced P2X7R activation promote the ATP release via the formation of membrane pores, meanwhile intensified stimulation of ATP enhance the expression of P2X7R. The dynamic association between ATP release and P2X7R expression strengthens their functions against challenge with CII. As previously reported, ATP activated the P2X7R to induce cytokine responses in inflammatory conditions 59 . In this work, we have explored the release of six inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 , TGF-\u03b2 1, IL-23, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-6) from DCs in response to CII. Considerable research effort has focused on the possible mechanism downstream of ATP-P2X7R for the induction of inflammatory cytokines, including NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion 60 , PKC/MAPK signalling pathway for TGF-\u03b2 1 61 and p38 MAPK pathway for IL-6 62 . Collectively, we believe the activation of downstream signals of ATP-P2X7R axis is likely responsible for the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by CII. Further studies are needed to elucidate signalling pathways for the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by CII.",

Further analysis in spleen T cells from CIA mice showed the same change trends of the above indices for Th17 cell differentiation. Based on these findings, we propose that CII promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells via P2X7R signaling both in vivo and in vitro.",

Schlegel et al. 63 demonstrated that in addition to Th17 cells, a substantial number of other innate and adaptive immune cells, in particular also B cells participate in the IL-17 production during established RA. Another study also identified B cells as a major source for rapid, innate-like IL-17 production in vivo in response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection 64 . P2X7R is expressed on cells of the immune system, including CD4 T cells and B cells 65 . However, it is still unknown whether P2X7R antagonist effect is only specific to CD4 T cells rather than B cells. We speculate that it is possible that P2X7R antagonists induced both inhibition of CD4 T cells and B cells may work simultaneously to abolish the CII-mediated increase in IL-17A in vivo.",

Our results indicated that blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated the pathological changes in ankle joint of the CIA mice. These results clearly suggest that P2X7R might be an interesting target for the clinical treatment of RA. Since the blockade of P2X7R can attenuate the differentiation of Th17 cells promoted by CII in vivo and in vitro, further application of therapeutic regimen targeting P2X7R should be investigated.",

As previously reviewed, although blocking GM-CSF or its receptor has been regarded as available potent anti-inflammatory therapies, GM-CSF can act as an anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine in many situations 66, 67 . It can increase regulatory T-cell numbers and function by modulating differentiation of DCs 68 . Interestingly, Gathungu et al. 69 demonstrated that elevated GM-CSF autoantibody was a risk marker for aggressive Crohn's disease behavior and complications including surgery, indicating that deficiency of GM-CSF can contribute to a relative immunodeficiency. A case report by Rowin et al. 70 revealed that GM-CSF treatment leaded to a sustained increase in the Foxp3 expression and an enhance capability of Foxp3+ CD4+ CD25+ Tregs to limit the proliferative capacities of CD4+ T effector cells. Our study showed that P2X7R presented positive effect on the differentiation of Th17 cells through its pro-inflammatory role and P2X7R inhibition attenuated joint damage of CIA mice. Given the opposite effects of GM-CSF and P2X7R on the regulation of Tregs/Th17 balance, we postulate GM-CSF may possibly affect the expression of P2X7R and hence attenuate CIA. Further experiments are needed to test the hypothesis.",
