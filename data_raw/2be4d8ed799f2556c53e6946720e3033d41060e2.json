Spatial clustering analysis can detect spatial autocorrelation when the values of variables at nearby locations are not independent from each other [6] . The basic assumption of spatial autocorrelation is that biological processes such as speciation, extinction, dispersal or species interactions are distancerelated [7] . Spatial autocorrelation may be seen as an opportunity for further analysis, as it provides information for inference of process from pattern such as geographic dispersal of TB [8, 9] . A study conducted by Roza DL had used spatial analysis to identify the areas with elevated risk of TB and evaluate the influences of social vulnerability [10] . Factors affecting the distribution and pattern of TB, including TB notification rate and TB incidence rate etc., usually show spatial autocorrelation and obvious spatial heterogeneity [11] , which is difficult for the traditional model to deal with [12] . The TB epidemic environments which have limited resources and tools to assist decision support need to take account of these limitations. However, spatial antocorrelation is one way to expore the relationship of factor among the neighboring areas. Additionally, there are few surveys developed for describing TB spatial distribution based on county-level nationally in China.",

When Moran's I is near 0, there is no spatial clustering, meaning that the data are randomly distributed [21] . The data of this study were stored by ArcGIS 10 software to create a spatial database and the global spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using the package of Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I) in ArcGIS 10. Furthermore, the reverse distance between two areas was considered as the conceptualization of spatial relationship, implying that nearby neighboring features had a larger influence on the computation for a target feature than that features far away [22] .

SaTScan version 9.1.1 using Kulldorf method of retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model, was applied to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with high rates that had statistically significantly exceeded TB notification rates of nearby areas(p<0.05). SaTScan is a open source cluster software program developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other institutions. And the space-time scan statistics can be used for time-periodic surveillance, where the analysis is repeated every year [23] . Not only the geographical information, but also the time-periodic variable can be utilized by the space-time scan statistics to explore the possible spatial concentration and temporal persistence. In this study, the surveillance database for 7 years was collected from 2005 to 2011. TB cases notified in each county were used and recorded against the population in the same county which was assumed as the population in the Possion probability model. The space-time scan statistic creates an infinite number of discrete, cylindrical windows with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. The base is defined exactly as for the purely spatial scan statistic, while the height reflects the time period of potential clusters. Each cylindrical window was evaluated as a possible TB space-time cluster [23] . Therefore, the space-time scan statistic that can use both the geographical information and the time-periodic variable simultaneously is more suitable for the database. The distribution and statistical significance of the space-time clusters was analyzed by means of Monte Carlo replication under the null hypothesis with the default 999 replications to ensure adequate power for defining clustering. Most likely clusters and secondary clusters were reported by SaTScan. The likelihood function is maximized over all window locations and sizes, and the one with the maximum likelihood constitutes the most likely cluster, which is least likely to have occurred by chance. Secondary clusters were detected in the same way as for the most likely cluster, by comparing the log likelihood ratio of secondary clusters in the real data set with the log likelihood ratios of the most likely cluster in the simulated data sets [23] . TB Clusters including most likely cluster and secondary clusters, were presented in this study.",

It is widely believed that smear positive patients with TB are more infectious than smear negative patients. Thus new SS+ notification rate is one indicator of TB transmission risk and Total TB notification rate is one indicator of TB burden. Because Type A region in Figure 2 was under the coverage of clusters for new SS+ notification rate but not under the coverage of clusters for total TB notification rate, Type A region had less TB burden than the neighboring areas on SS-cases, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB, but more risks of TB transmission. This may be explained by (1) Type A region is mountainousand has facilities with lesser techniques of TB diagnosis. Many TB patients with atypical symptoms of TB in Type A region had to go to the big hospitals with high techniques for further diagnosis which are located in other big cities. As such TB patients then were reported by those big hospitals (2) . this area is characterized by low temperatures and hence the people live in the very close proximity which increases the risk of TB transmission among the inhabitants.",

Hohhot and Taiyuan cities as the provincial capitals of Inner Mongolia and Shanxi provinces respectively have designed TB facilities with higher techniques for TB diagnosis and treatment, clustered more cases which can not be diagnosed in local hospitals with lesser techniques in other prefecture cities or counties. As an indicator of TB burden, total TB notification rate lumps together SS-cases, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB besides SS +, this was associated with more clustering as shown in Figure  2 -B. This patient flow from prefecture city or county to provincial capital could result in the difference of clusters between Figure 2 -B and A.

Therefore, Spatial-temporal clustering analysis by SaTScan was utilized. SaTScan would still be concentrated in the geographical clustering areas. Simultaneously, it would be extended in a third dimension reflecting the population size as it changes over time. Although the results of global spatial autocorrelation on new SS+ notification rate didn't indicate significant temporal trend, the statistical analysis of Global Moran's I every year was significant and the clusters were detected by SaTScan in the south-central, northeast and west regions of China. As patients with sputum smear-negative TB are less infectious than patients with sputum smear-positive TB [24] , this may suggest that close contacts of patients with positive smear were more likely to develop TB disease [25] . Thus, areas of clusters for new SS+ notification rate had more risks of TB transmission than the other areas. But these clusters didn't have the trend to aggregate year by year due to insignificant statistics of the trend test for Moran's I. Thus, it was suggested that these areas of clusters for new SS+ notification rate with high risk of TB transmission in population should allow prioritization of focused infection control interventions.",
