            "text": "Background: Guidelines in the healthcare field generally should contain evidence-based recommendations to inform healthcare decisions. Guidelines often require 2 years or more to develop, but certain circumstances necessitate the development of rapid guidelines (RGs) in a short period of time. Upholding methodological rigor while meeting the reduced development timeframe presents a challenge for developing RGs. Our objective was to review current practices and standards for the development of RGs. This is the first of a series of three articles addressing methodological issues around RGs. Methods: We conducted a systematic survey of methods manuals and published RGs to identify reasons for the development of RGs. Data sources included existing guideline manuals, published RGs, Trip Medical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE and communication with guideline developers until February 2018. Results: We identified 46 guidelines that used a shortened timeframe for their development. Nomenclature describing RGs varied across organisations, wherein the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced 'Interim Guidelines', the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom developed 'Short Clinical Guidelines', and WHO provided 'Rapid Advice'. The rationale for RGs included response to emergencies, rapid increases in cases of a condition or disease severity, or new evidence regarding treatment. In general, the methods to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflict of interest were not always clear. While we identified another 11 RGs from other institutions, there was no reference to timeframe and reasons for conducting a RG. The three organisations mentioned above provide guidance for the development of RGs. Conclusions: There is a lack of standardised nomenclature and definitions regarding RGs and there is inconsistency in the methods described in manuals and in RG. It is therefore important that all RGs provide a detailed and transparent description of their methods in order for readers and end-users to be able to assess their quality and validate their findings.",

However, certain situations require the development, dissemination and implementation of guidelines within a condensed timeframe such as in response to a public health emergency or urgent humanitarian crisis [2] .",

From organisations that published more than five guidelines in that period (considered as regularly publishing RGs), all RGs were selected and assessed. Six investigators (RLM, MF, IDF, II, YZ, WW) independently screened titles and abstracts, and the full text of potentially relevant articles was obtained to determine eligibility. We developed and pilot tested a data abstraction form to extract information about the topics of interest. The abstraction form collected information on (1) condition evaluated; (2) guideline group member composition, (3) number of research questions requiring recommendations; (4) number of recommendations; (5) guideline's timeframe (including time spent in each step and time to completion); (6) evidence review process; (7) quality of evidence assessment procedures; (8) factors considered when formulating recommendations; (9) considerations about costs and stakeholder involvement; and (10) reasons for developing a RG instead of a standard guideline. An additional file shows the information collected in more detail (Additional file 1). For the pilot phase, four investigators (MF, II, YZ, FS) abstracted data from two RGs, namely 'Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture' and 'Rapid advice: Diagnosis, prevention and management of cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected adults, adolescents and children' [6, 7] . Subsequently, eight investigators (RLM, MF, IDF, II, YZ, FS, SK, LI) independently and in duplicate reviewed eligible studies and abstracted data.",

The nomenclature related to RGs was not uniform across organisations ( Table 1) . Table 2 depicts the key characteristics of the RGs evaluated. WHO guidelines (n = 8) were related to chronic infectious diseases including HIV and emerging infections [7, 11, 15, 22, 25, 31, 39, 47] . The reasons provided for RG were the sudden increase in incidence along with high case-fatality rates of the disease (e.g. human cases of avian influenza), the emergence of new treatment modalities, new evidence on existing treatments or new diagnostic tests. For two guidelines, HIV and infant feeding and tuberculosis in children, the rationale was not described [10, 11] . The development timeframe varied from 5 to 12 months. NICE Short Clinical Guidelines (n = 9) focused primarily on the diagnosis or treatment of chronic diseases [6, 26, 33, 34, 36-38, 49, 52] . The reasons for conducting an RG were not always clear; however, some RGs reported rationale as uncertainty in disease management or in clinical practice.

The rationale for developing RGs on influenza, Zika, anthrax, and Ebola control and management was based on the uncertainty about the disease evolution and transmission, the lack of an effective vaccine, and high mortality and morbidity. The scope of the CDC RG was broad and varied from case definitions, surveillance for different settings (e.g. schools) and treatment with antivirals. The CDC also produced RGs related to other infections (e.g. osteoarticular infections, polio vaccination, HIV prevention and prophylaxis) [20, 21, 23, 24, 29] . The reasons to develop these RGs, in general, were to present new evidence and provide recommendations to reduce the risk of disease transmission and infection. References for the tools used to assess the quality of evidence were found in RGs of WHO and NICE, but not in the CDC.",

Similarly, regarding group composition, patient participation was identified in all NICE guidelines, in 30% of WHO guidelines, in only one CDC guideline, and was not reported in the guidelines from other institutions.

Experts in guideline methods participated in all NICE guidelines and in 30% of WHO guidelines, but other institutions did not mention their participation.

WHO reported the methods used to achieve consensus among members of the guideline development group in the majority of their guidelines; no other organisations mentioned their decisionmaking processes. Within the domain 'rigor of development' , both WHO and NICE guidelines scored higher than the CDC and others. WHO guidelines had lower scores in the applicability domain. Only WHO and NICE consistently described the external review process for their guidelines. Regarding editorial independence, WHO guidelines achieved the highest scores compared with NICE, CDC and others.

            "text": "WHO defines a rapid advice guideline as an evidence-informed guideline produced within 1-3 months providing global leadership and timely guidance in response to emergencies or to an urgent need [1] . The timeframe in which guidelines are required differentiates the planning for the development of standard or rapid advice guidelines. The methods for guideline development should follow the same basic steps as for a standard guideline with modifications as required to meet the timeline dictated by the emergency. The WHO approval and quality control processes may be accelerated for this type of guideline. For example, rapid advice guidelines may be described as evidence based, but are not necessarily supported by a standard systematic review of evidence, whereas standard guidelines are expected to be supported by standard systematic evidence reviews. Additionally, the peer-review process for rapid advice guidelines may be limited to a review of the completed draft only, immediately before final clearance. Peer review may occur just before clearance and reviewers may be limited in number to between three and six experts rather than more, and precluded in some situations based on time constraints. Standard guidelines require a more complete peer-review process. In comparison, more comprehensive peer review is required for standard guidelines, including a review of the questions, a review of the evidence tables and draft recommendations, and a record of responses to the peer review and changes made to the document. Rapid advice guidelines require a defined date and plan for updating or conversion to a standard guideline. The WHO Handbook specifies two types of guidelines in response to an emergency or urgent need, namely 'rapid advice guidelines' as discussed above and 'emergency (rapid response) guidelines' [1] . WHO develops emergency guidelines when a public health emergency necessitates a response within hours to days; the recommendations may be based on previous guidelines or even expert opinion [1] . However, if the public health emergency continues for an extended period, emergency guidelines must be reviewed, taking into account both the evidence emerging from the current emergency and a systematic review of the relevant evidence.",

The development of RGs is an alternative to meet the needs of policy-makers, programme managers and healthcare workers. However, there is limited information about how RGs are developed and implemented and their impact on health outcomes. This study presents current practices for RG development and the quality of RGs produced by diverse organisations. Differences between the RG organisations identified in this study include the rationale for the development of RGs to justify the shortened timeframe. WHO RG defined the rationale for developing RGs more clearly than NICE or CDC. Often, the reason was implicit, such as the threats of new emerging diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza A (H5N1) infection, as well as pandemics of chronic diseases requiring international action and recommendations [55] . Only a few of the identified guidelines reported the duration of development (ranging from 5 to 26 months) [10, 55, 57] . Additionally, few RGs reported the involvement of guideline methodologists or end-users (e.g. patients, consumers, programme managers, etc.) during development.",

Standard systematic reviews often take from 6 months to 1 year to complete [58] . To address requests for literature reviews in shorter time periods and to facilitate informed decision-making and understand the credibility of rapid reviews, their methods should be explicit and transparent [59] . Butler [60] , studying rapid assessments, identified that selection bias, publication bias and language of publication bias may be introduced when using literature that is readily accessible to a researcher. Ganann et al. [58] noted that rapid reviews with shorter timeframes (1-3 months) were often less systematic in their search for evidence than those with longer timeframes (3-6 months). Another study by Watt et al. [61] showed that full reviews were more likely than rapid reviews to report clinical outcomes, economic factors and social issues, and to provide greater depth of information and detail in recommendations. The authors suggested that using rapid reviews might lead to uncertainty around the conclusions drawn and inability to answer certain types of questions (e.g. economic analyses). However, they found that, although the scope of rapid reviews is limited, they can provide adequate advice for clinical and policy decisions. For RG developers, considering the amount of resources required to maintain quality in a short timeframe remains a challenge but can be overcome by working in larger and qualified teams [59, 60] . In fact, remaining systematic in the identification and use of evidence is equally important for RGs as it is for standard guidelines and RGs should not rely on expert opinion without stating the evidence from which this opinion is formed.",

In response to the avian influenza pandemic (H5N1), WHO developed a RG within 4 months using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. When assessed using AGREE II, this guideline was determined to be of high quality. Although one of the authors of the current article was an author of that guideline, the assessment of the guideline using AGREE II was conducted by authors not involved in developing that guideline. Preceding uptake of rapid guideline development in the WHO handbook, the authors of the guidelines explicitly reported the methods used. The authors attributed the transparency and the short amount of time used to prepare the guideline (4 months) to utilising the GRADE approach and methods developed for the WHO shortly before the guideline work began [55] . They suggested that the time can be reduced by identifying collaborating centres capable of elaborating evidence profiles and also by building up in-house capacity to reduce the time needed to organise a review team. The use of tools such as the GRADEpro Guideline Development tool (www.gradepro.org) that keep records of evidence, decisions and judgments, facilitates the development of updated RGs, as recently demonstrated in WHO delamanide and bedaquiline guidelines for multidrug resistant tuberculosis [67] .",
