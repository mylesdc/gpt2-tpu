An example is the stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to 39 direction slippage of the reading-frame during elongation, by specific pseudoknot stimulators downstream of the frameshifting site. By investigating a recently identified regulatory element upstream of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 21 frameshifting site, it is shown that a minimal functional element with hairpin forming potential is sufficient to down-regulate21 frameshifting activity. Mutagenesis to disrupt or restore base pairs in the potential hairpin stem reveals that base-pair formation is required for21 frameshifting attenuation in vitro and in 293T cells. The attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is determined by its stability and proximity to the frameshifting site; however, it is insensitive to E site sequence variation. Additionally, using a dual luciferase assay, it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated +1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast. The investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis-acting programmed reading-frame switch modulator. This result provides insight into mechanisms governing21 frameshifting stimulation and attenuation. Since the upstream hairpin is unwound (by a marching ribosome) before the downstream stimulator, this study's findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin during elongation.",

These include a) an intra-molecular duplex (formed via sequence complementarities) having to be unwound for decoding, and b) one of three potential reading-frames having to be maintained for faithful protein synthesis. The ribosome possesses helicase activity that allows for the unwinding of RNA duplexes [1, 2] while reading-frame maintenance is closely coupled with translocation [3] . However, unwinding of specific RNA structures can pause or stall the ribosome for further elongation regulation [4] . In particular, specific mRNA signals can program a ribosome to switch reading-frames during elongation, with the ribosome slipping backward (toward the 59-direction) or forward (toward the 39-direction) by a single nucleotide. It then continues translation in the new21 or +1 reading-frame.

In particular, an optimally placed internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in prokaryotic mRNA may serve as a 21 PRF stimulator by pairing with the anti-SD element in 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 70S ribosome [11] . In addition, 21 frameshifting efficiency can be affected positively or negatively by flanking sequences upstream of a slippery site [12, 13] . Previously, we identified a 170-nucleotide RNA element (ATT), upstream of the21 PRF slippery site of SARS-CoV mRNA, capable of down-regulating viral21 PRF [14] . Recently, ATT was shown to optimize viral replication and was suggested to act by causing a fraction of the elongating ribosome to fall-off in front of the ATT [15] . Understanding how21 PRF attenuation is achieved would not only shed light on how a 21 PRF stimulator promotes21 frameshifting and provide insight into the mechanism governing reading-frame control, but also may have potential for antiviral applications because21 PRF efficiency is crucial for the replication of several human viral pathogens, including HIV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [15, 16] .",

Interestingly, the crystal structure of an elongation mode of the 70S ribosome indicates that nucleotides within the first codon upstream of the E codon are flexible [17] . The implication being that these nucleotides are accessible for base-pair formation. Therefore, we disrupted two potential AU base pairs in the lower stem of the predicted hairpin to generate two AC mismatched mutations at the 13363-13520 construct. We found that the resultant 59CC-WT construct lost two-thirds of its attenuation activity compared with an intact hairpin (Figs. 2B and 2C). Because both 59CC-WT and 13363-13520 constructs share 27 identical nucleotides upstream of their slippery sites, the attenuation activity difference is not likely to be caused by an E-site flanking sequences effect [12, 13] but rather by the disruption of the two potential AU base pairs. Similar results were observed for GC-SB-WT and 6BPGC hairpins when potential Watson-Crick base pairs were disrupted (Figs. 2B and 2C). Together, these results suggest that base-pair formation and the composition of the predicted hairpin stem are crucial for efficient attenuation. Next, we swapped six GC base pairs for six corresponding wild-type base pairs in the predicted hairpin stem within a longer SARS-CoV viral sequence (13318-WT) (Fig. 3A) and found that the attenuation activity of the chimera was further enhanced both in vitro and in 293T cell cultures ( Fig. 3B and 3C) , indicating that the predicted stem-loop is a major determinant of 21 PRF attenuation activity in SARS-CoV ATT.",

On the other hand, disrupting potential base pairs at 39flanking CG impaired attenuation activity by a third (Fig. S1B compares UUCG-6BPGC with GAAA-6BPGC). Especially important is the disruption of two GC base pairs at the bottom of the hairpin stem (6BPGC12AG). Such a disruption dramatically reduced attenuation activity. This evidence seems to show that two extra GC base pairs involving 39-flanking CG lead to an extended stem and contribute to attenuation activity. However, only one potential GC base pair exists in the corresponding region of wildtype SARS-CoV viral RNA sequences (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that this extra base pair is not essential for attenuation activity by the wild-type SARS-CoV attenuator hairpin. To see if these observations are valid and applicable to a different stimulator in other biological systems, selected 6BPGC 59-flanking sequence mutants were placed upstream of a distinct 21 PRF stimulator, the DU177 pseudoknot [19] , and examined for their attenuation activity in 293T cells. The results (Fig. S1C ) indicate that the two potential base pairs involving E-site sequences are not the main cause of observed attenuation activity in 293T cell cultures.",

When the spacing was increased from 2 to 5 nucleotides, attenuation activity was reduced by about a half. It was reduced further by the insertion of additional nucleotides (Figs. 5B and 5C). The spacing dependency of attenuation activity in yeast and a construct containing the DU177 pseudoknot stimulator was also examined and confirmed (Fig. 5D ). Varying the ratio between mRNA and ribosomes in in vitro assays so that the amount of ribosomes available for each mRNA was different did not affect attenuation activity significantly (Figs. 5E and 5F). This result indicates that the lower attenuation activity attributable to a distant hairpin is not likely due to hairpin unwinding by an adjacent marching ribosome. Cumulatively, these results establish the following: 1) attenuation activity of a hairpin depends on its spacing to the slippery site; 2) attenuation functions are preserved among distinct eukaryotic systems; and 3) attenuators down-regulate distinct 21 PRF stimulators.",

As E site sequences can affect the potency of downstream stimulators [12, 13] , we ask whether the potency of attenuators can be affected by either proximal E site sequences or downstream stimulators. A weakened M1 attenuator hairpin, derived from a 6BPGC hairpin with a disrupted GC base pair (in the middle of the hairpin stem ( Fig. 6A )), and a potent DU177 21 PRF stimulator were used to address these issues. They were chosen because a potent 6BPGC hairpin attenuated a weaker SARS 21 PRF stimulator so efficiently that the resultant intensity of radioactivity in in vitro assays gave uncertain results (data not shown). Consistent with flanking sequences effects, changing sequences in the 21 frame E site led to variations in 21 frameshifting efficiencies. These were promoted by the same stimulator regardless of the absence or presence of an M1 attenuator. However, calculated 21 PRF attenuation efficiencies of the M1 attenuator remained virtually unchanged among different E-site sequence variants (Fig. 6B) , indicating that the attenuator down-regulates 21 PRF to a similar extent under flanking-sequences effects. By contrast, attenuation efficiencies of the M1 attenuator were different among constructs containing DU177 or SARS 21 PRF stimulator (Fig. 6C ), implying discrimination toward distinct stimulators.",

This suggests that 21 PRF attenuation is not mediated by either mechanism. We then investigated the possibility that an attenuator could actively alleviate the proposed strain triggered by ribosomal helicase resistance to a 21 PRF stimulator [2, 8] and thus offset 21 frameshifting.

We reasoned that a partially functional CUUCGGC sequence represented an ideal platform for evaluating the properties of an upstream 6BPGC hairpin (Fig. 7) . Indeed, a reporter construct of AGG-containing hepta-nucleotides possessed high +1 frameshifting activity (compared with random-sequence negative controls) whereas the +1 frameshifting activity of a reporter with CGG-containing hepta-nucleotides decreased significantly (Fig. 7) . In this study, the smaller difference in +1 frameshifting efficiency between AGG and CGG constructs compared with that of Ty1 retrotransposon may result from a difference in E site sequence identity (CGC versus CAC) [22] . Importantly, we found that an upstream 6BPGC hairpin with 59flanking sequences designed to prevent direct E site invasion stimulated +1 frameshifting of the CGG-containing shift site (Fig. 7) . By contrast, mutants carrying mutations to disrupt base pairs at the hairpin stem (59-WT construct of Fig. 7) lost the ability to stimulate +1 frameshifting. Therefore, this upstream 6BPGC hairpin may act as a +1 frameshifting stimulator and is indeed a programmed reading-frame switch regulator.",

Comparison of the encoded amino acids between constructs 13363-13520 and 59CC-WT (Fig. 2) in mutation sites that disrupts 2 AU base pairs reveals a leucine to proline change. By contrast, a similar leucine to proline change from constructs 39GG-WT to GC-SB-WT (Fig.2) increased 21 PRF attenuation activity. Thus, reduced 21 PRF attenuation activity in 59CC-WT is not caused by the replacement of encoded leucine with proline in the mutation sites. Additionally, amino acid compositions encoded by 6BPGC, r-Bulge, and 6GC hairpin ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 ) are changed further (Table S1 ) with the maintenance of substantial 21 PRF attenuation activity.

Our observation of a positive correlation between hairpin stability and attenuation efficiency (Fig. 4D ) strongly suggests that base-pair reformation of the upstream hairpin stem plays a crucial role in the reduction of 21 PRF efficiency. Furthermore, mutating two nucleotides (27 nucleotides upstream of the E site) to disrupt Watson-Crick base pairs in the lower hairpin stem dramatically impairs attenuation activity (Fig. 2) , indicating that attenuation is not caused by primary sequencemediated flanking-sequences effects [12, 13] . Together, these observations support the idea that a ribosomal unwound hairpin stem can partially reform when the final codon in the 39-half of the lower stem leaves the E site. The proposed ribosomal fall-off hypothesis that has original ATT impeding ribosome processivity [15] could work here. However, such a mechanism should decrease the observed efficiencies for both +1 PRF and 21 PRF. Additionally, the 6GC hairpin used in this work is not likely to cause a ribosome to fall off because the ribosomal helicase is capable of unwinding a duplex of 27 base pairs [1] . This raises the question of what the other potential mechanisms responsible for programmed reading-frame regulation by a refolding hairpin are.",

            "text": "Although final proof of the existence of a refolding hairpin stem proximal to the ribosomal E site during 21 PRF stimulation awaits direct physical evidence such as ribosome crystallography and mRNA : rRNA cross-linking analysis, the available 70S ribosome structure mimicking the elongation stage of translation indicates that duplex formation between SD and anti-SD can exist 5 to 6 nucleotides upstream of the P site [17] and overlaps the region where the cis-acting hairpin stem reforms. Additionally, Cryo-EM structures of the 80S ribosome-bound viral internal ribosomal entry site indicate that a folded structure can be accommodated in the space surrounding the mRNA exit site [24, 25] . In this context, SD ? anti-SD duplex formation has been shown to change the mRNA exit channel pathway and create numerous ribosomal interactions [26] . Thus, formation of a refolding cis-acting hairpin stem could create contacts with the 80S ribosome to modulate the E site network and regulate a programmed reading-frame switch. In a non-mutually exclusive model, the +1 frameshifting stimulation and 21 PRF attenuation properties of a refolding hairpin can be explained by a pulling force in the 59-direction generated by hairpin stem closure. This explanation is consistent with proposed mechanical tension triggered by a 21 PRF stimulator [2] . In agreement with this active role, a refolding GC-rich hairpin has been shown to exert a 59-pulling force on RNA-DNA hybrids at the active site of RNA polymerase [27] . Alternatively, the upstream hairpin may serve as a wheel chock that blocks 21 ribosomal movement during late stage of hairpin refolding. Thus, a stable hairpin upstream of the slippery site represents a cis-acting RNA motif for 21 PRF attenuation. This is in contrast to the downstream 21 PRF stimulator. These revelations should be of much interest when further studies on the programmed frameshifting mechanism are being planned. By contrast, a much more stable structure, such as the original ATT in SARS CoV, could still affect viral 21 PRF efficiency by serving as a translational attenuator as previously proposed [15] . However, deletion of six nucleotides to disrupt the minimal upstream hairpin stem in an ATT-containing construct (construct 13318-13520 D6 in Fig. 4B ) restored 21 PRF efficiency to that of the ATT-lacking 13390-13520 construct in vitro (compare lanes 1 and 4 of Fig. 4B and Fig. 1B) .",

However, moving the cis-acting attenuator hairpin 59 further reduced its 21 frameshifting attenuation activity (Fig. 5) , whereas moving the internal SD ? anti-SD duplex further upstream of the slippery site converted the duplex into a 21 PRF stimulator [11] . A possible reason is that the 16S rRNA component of 70S ribosome is part of the functional duplex, whereas the eukaryotic ribosome does not have an anti-SD sequence. It will be interesting to see if an in-cis acting RNA hairpin can replace the functionality of internal SD ? anti-SD interaction in the 70S ribosome.",

Luciferase activity measurements for transfected 293T cell lysates were performed using the Dual Luciferase TM reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a CHAMELEON TM multi-label plate reader (HIDEX). All the experiments were repeated three times with four to six assays for each reaction. Frameshifting efficiency was then calculated according to previously described procedures [29] . The firefly/Renilla activity ratio generated from the control reporter was divided into that from frameshift reporters carrying frameshifting signals of interest and multiplied by 100 to obtain frameshifting efficiencies (expressed as percentages) for each recoding signal.",

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 1 mL of ice cold lysis buffer (16 PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF) and then re-suspended in 0.3 mL of the same buffer. Cells suspensions were lysed with glass beads by agitation in a vortex mixer at 4uC for 3 minutes. Dual-luciferase activities were determined using 20 mL lysate/sample by a Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and on a CHAMELEON TM multi-label plate reader (HIDEX). Frameshift efficiencies were calculated using the method previously described [29] , except that the pJD375 reporter [30] was used as a control to measure the firefly/Renilla activity ratio. All assays were performed in triplicate. Figure S1 Potential base pairs involving the E site sequences are not essential for attenuation. (A) The 59flanking sequences GACG (typed in green) of 6BPGC hairpin are part of the SalI restriction site (underlined) used during cloning, and have the potential to form base pairs with the 39-flanking sequences CGUU (also typed in green) of the hairpin to generate four extra base pairs (connected by dashed lines) in the bottom of an attenuator hairpin stem. The 59-flanking nucleotides mutated for disrupting potential base-pairings are listed below the drawing and typed in red with the number of potential base pairs left after disruption shown in parentheses. The 2 terminal GC base pairs disrupted in 6BPGC12AG for comparison are boxed.

Free energy prediction was performed using sequences that include the two extended GC base pairs involving spacer (boxed). The base pairs, which changed along the hairpin stem in each mutant, are typed in bold. All the variants share the same CGUU 39-flanking sequence to minimize the E site flanking sequence effect.
