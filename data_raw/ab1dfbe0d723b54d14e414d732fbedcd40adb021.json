At the end of 2005, only 17 countries had H5N1 outbreaks in chickens, ducks, or humans [1] . As of September 2007, the virus has circulated in 60 countries [1] , mutations have been reported (for example, in a patient in Turkey [2] and another in Thailand [3] ), and virologists and public health officials nervously watch clusters of probable human-to-human spread of the virus, such as in Thailand in 2004 and Indonesia in 2006 [4] . For reasons not fully understood, most human cases and clusters of probable human-to-human transmission of H5N1 since January 2006 have occurred in Indonesia [5, 6] .",

How devastating might such a transformation be? In an age of globalization and commercial air travel, estimating how great a toll a lethal human-to-human influenza virus could inflict is difficult. Estimates of deaths from the last great bird-to-human flu pandemic of 1918 range from 50 to 100 million [9] , which provides a glimpse of the global damage that could be caused by a pandemic influenza accelerated by 21st century globalization.",
