The prevalence of American cockroach allergy as determined by skin test ranges from 40~57% in Taiwan [1, 5] , 44~60% in Thailand [6] , 55~79% in Brazil [7] , and 53% in India [8] . Previous studies have characterized 12 groups of allergenic components, namely Per a 1~12, from P. americana [9] [10] [11] [12] . We previously reported that allergens from American cockroaches exhibit varying levels of pathogenicity. Sensitization to Per a 2 correlated with more severe clinical phenotype and inflammation among patients with airway allergy [11] . Furthermore, we found Per a 2 protein existed abundantly in roach feces and was more resistant to decomposition up to one year in the environment, [12] which would tend to make it more likely to persist in the environment.",

However, complete eradication of cockroach infestations in workplaces and homes is extremely challenging. In addition to traditional antihistamines and glucocorticoids with various delivery systems, a number of novel biologic target agents for the treatment of allergic inflammation have emerged. However, allergen-specific immunotherapy remains the only approach to establish specific immune tolerance and potentially cure the disease [16, 17] . Traditional immunotherapy for cockroach allergy is based on crude extracts containing a wide variety of undesirable proteins and may involve a long and cumbersome treatment course, lasting up to 5 years or more [17, 18] .",

This approach has also been extended to the field of allergen expression. The feasibility of allergenspecific immunotherapy using plant-derived vaccines has also been demonstrated recently [26] [27] [28] . However, cockroach immunotherapy with plant-expressed allergen vaccine has yet to be studied. TuMV belongs to the genus Potyvirus, one of the most important groups of positive sense ssRNA plant viruses infecting a vast array of crops worldwide. Several infectious clones of TuMV have been generated as useful molecular tools for studying the viral expression of heterologous open reading frames in plants [29, 30] .",
