The Filoviridae virus family includes three genera: Cueva virus, Marburg virus, and EBOV. Ebola virions are uniform, with a diameter of 70-90 nm and a length of 300-1500 nm. The envelope, putatively derived from the host cell membrane, binds a 45-60 nm diameter nucleocapsid [6] . EBOV is composed of five different species: Bundibugyo, Sudan, Za\u00efre, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Reston. The first three species of EBOV have been linked to outbreaks in Africa, whereas the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Reston subspecies have not been associated with any Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) human outbreaks to date. The virus responsible for the 2014 West African outbreak belongs to the Za\u00efre species. The genome of Za\u00efre EBOV encodes seven polyproteins and one non-structural protein, including the glycoprotein (GP), nucleoprotein (NP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), virion protein (VP) 24, VP30, VP35, VP40, and secreted glycoprotein (sGP) [7, 8] .",

[9] observed that sGP interacted with neutrophils through CD16b to inhibit early neutrophil activation, whereas the transmembrane glycoprotein interacted with endothelial cells likely contributing to the hemorrhagic symptoms of this disease. Additionally, the VP40 matrix protein and VP24 of EBOV might play a role with the formation of the surrounding envelope, virus assembly and budding [10, 11] , however, VP30 and VP35 might involve the transcription and replication of Ebola. NP, the primary structural protein, was associated with filovirus nucleocapsids [12] .

Although lymphocytes are known to be resistant against EBOV, they undergo apoptosis leading to a decrease in lymphocyte counts. An inference can be drawn that the cells above might express entry receptors of EBOV. Replication of filoviruses in widespread macrophages and dendritic cells, namely 'sentinel' cells, results in their necrosis and the release of abundant new viral particles into extracellular fluid [14] . Meanwhile, hepatocytes are destroyed and necrosis occurs, leading to dysregulation of clotting factors and even coagulopathy. Adrenocortical necrosis can also be observed, causing hypotension and impaired steroid synthesis. In addition to causing extensive tissue damage, EBOV also triggers macrophages, monocytes and other cells to release a cocktail of cytokines, chemokines, and a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and nitric oxide, which not only destroy the vascular endothelium but also activate the coagulation cascade [15, 16] .",

Filoviruses cause a severe and frequently fatal illness, partially, due to damage of dendritic cell function and promotion of lymphocyte apoptosis. As to the function of dendritic cells, they bear the primary responsibility to start the adaptive immune response and are a major site for replication of filoviruses. According to several in vitro investigation studies, infected dendritic cells fail to present antigens to naive lymphocytes attributing to the lack of mature cell development. These results suggest an underlying mechanism as to why patients dying from EVD may not develop antibodies to the virus [18, 19] . Moreover, attrition of lymphocytes is another phenomenon observed in lethal EBOV infection. Although lymphocytes are not directly infected by EBOV, the overall systemic infection induces massive bystander apoptosis [20, 21] .",

There are two stimulus factors, coagulation defects and virus-infected macrophages synthesizing cell-surface tissue factor (TF), which happen simultaneously and may contribute to the rapid progress and critical severity of the coagulopathy involved with EBOV infection. The former events appear to be triggered indirectly by the host inflammatory response, while the latter is activated the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines also induce macrophages to produce TF. In addition, other factors such as activated protein C and platelets may also be involved with the coagulation defects in EVD. A study by Hotchkiss RS and colleagues [22] showed that in EBOV-infected macaques, levels of activated protein C begin to decrease on day two post infection, while platelet counts decrease three or four days following infection, indicating that activated platelets are adhering to endothelial cells. Throughout EBV development, involvement of organ dysfunction such as hepatic injury will further cause a decline in plasma levels of certain coagulation factors.",

Electrolyte derangements are mostly secondary to the diarrhea and vomiting. Severe hypokalemia along with moderate degrees of hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia have been reported. In addition, capillary leakage combined with intravenous volume resuscitation commonly result in significant third spacing and peripheral edema. Although cough can occur, it is not a primary feature of this illness. Hiccups and dysphagia are often present, with severe associated discomfort. Hemorrhagic manifestations occurred in less than 10% of clinical cases, but these cases were relatively severe with poor outcomes. Primary causes of death are typically hypovolemic shock due to oro-gastric losses and third spacing (not hemorrhagic) related to severe electrolyte abnormalities. Renal failure is frequent in the late phase of severe disease. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of Ebola cases is essential to curb the Ebola outbreak.

Isolation and control of potential infection sources is the key measure to prevent and control Ebola. People returning from West African countries must remain in strict quarantine and people with positive or suspicious contact histories must remain in isolation. 3) National emergency. China has set up a strong infectious disease control and prevention system on the basis of knowledge acquired during the SARS outbreak following several public health urgencies. 4) Medical care. Medical staff is informed of the disease nature and an information bulletin is provided in a timely manner and strictly adhered to by the recommended infection control guidelines. 5) First aid. Once the Ebola virus infection appears, patients should be given symptomatic and supportive treatment. 6) Personal protection. Scientific understanding of the transmission route of Ebola can effectively control the spread of Ebola. 7) Etiquette custom. In the face of the highly contagious and lethal EBOV, we should change the handshake etiquette to avoid shaking hands and hugging with others. 8) Environmental sanitation. Maintaining proper sanitation is the key to prevent and control infectious diseases. Only when all these strategies have been implemented, will the transmission of disease in our country lessen.",

Positive anti-Ebola response and action plans from China have been proven effective. Development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic drugs are the main focus in next step. These top international pharmaceutical companies should put the drive for the profit aside and join the global intelligence to develop protective vaccines and effective drugs. As discussed above, the epidemiological features, pathogenesis, prognosis and outcomes associated with Ebola remain unclear. Therefore, more research should be conducted on these aspects to provide evidence for the prevention and control of Ebola. Genetic mutation of EBOV should be closely monitored, especially the effect of mutations on the virulence and transmission routes. Hopefully, under the global effort, the challenge brought by Ebola outbreak will be conquered in the near future. ",
