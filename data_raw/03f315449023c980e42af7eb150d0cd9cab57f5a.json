Camels are mostly bred in East African countries then exported into Africa and Middle East for consumption. To understand the distribution of MERS-CoV among camels in North Africa and the Middle East, we conducted surveillance in Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries. Real-time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries. Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built. The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences. Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels. A systematic active surveillance and longitudinal studies for MERS-CoV are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease and dynamics of viral infection.",

Among 2434 MERS-CoV human infection cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 27 countries as of 22 May, 2019, 876 deaths have been reported with case fatality rate of 35.9% [2] . Serological and molecular studies suggested that the main zoonotic source for MERS-CoV is dromedary camels, but the main origin of the virus is still unclear [3] [4] [5] . Epidemiological and viral sequence data suggest that camels are the main source for virus transmission to humans [6, 7] . Human to human transmission was recorded in clusters and outbreaks from the Arabian Peninsula and South Korea [8] [9] [10] .",

The majority of camels were imported from Sudan and sampled within no more than 10 days of importation. Two local farms breeding herds in Esna (South of Egypt, 49 camels) and Matrouh (Northwest coastal region, 65 camels) were longitudinally sampled. The same animals were resampled when possible. In Senegal, a total of 127 nasal swabs and 198 serum samples of camels were collected from seven areas (Gandon, Ndaye, Gantour, Ndoye, Rao, Tongon, and Toug) in the Saint-Louis region located in the northwest of the country during August and September 2017. All camels were pastoralist domestic. In Tunisia, a total of 1170 nasal swabs and 782 serum samples were collected from adult camels at seven markets (Douz, Ghlissia, Gollaa, Zaafrana, Ksar Ghilane, Ghidma, and Jamnah) during December 2015 to January 2018. In Uganda, 250 dromedary pastoralist domestic camels were sampled from February to March 2017, nasal and serum sample were obtained from each camel. Camels were collected from Moroto and Amudat districts located at Northern East Uganda. In Iraq, we collected 32 serum samples, and 26 nasal swabs during January 2017 from local camels at Wasit and Muthana governorates. Furthermore, 224 nasal swabs and 222 blood samples were collected from farm camels in the Western region of KSA.

After 1 h of adsorption, an additional 150 \u00b5L of culture medium was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for three more days at 37 \u2022 C in 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. A virus back-titration was performed without immune serum to assess input virus dose. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was read at three days post infection. The highest serum dilution that completely protected the cells from CPE in at least half of the wells was considered as the neutralizing antibody titer and was estimated using the Reed-Muench method. Positive cut off points were set at values greater or equal to 1:20 serum dilution points.",

            "text": "The main movement flow of dromedary camels in Africa is in the south-north direction rather than east-west movements [23] . Egypt annually imports large numbers of live dromedary camels from Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia to cover a part of its animal protein need. Some Sudanese camels are trekked to Egypt via the traditional route \"Fourties road\", but most of camels are transported from Sudan to Egypt by trucks to live animal markets (Draw and Birqash) The Birqash camel market in Giza governorate in Egypt is the largest market in Africa. Camels from horn of African countries are shipped to Egypt via the Red Sea then transported from ports to a quarantine station then directly to markets by trucks. Most of imported camels are slaughtered and a few of them are kept for fattening for several weeks before being put up for sale again. During our previous cross-sectional surveillance study in Egypt, results showed that 84.5% of tested camels had MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in their sera while 3.8% of camels were positive for MERS-CoV [16] . In the present study, 68.9% of camels in Egypt were seropositive for MERS-CoV while virus genetic materials were detected in 8.2% of investigated camels. The prevalence of MERS-CoV varied significantly by sampling collection site, governorate, sex, age, and origin of animals. Similar to our previous studies, analysis of the results based on origin of camels in Egypt indicated that imported camels had higher seroprevalence rate and rtRT-PCR positive cases of MERS-CoV than resident camels [16] . It appears that the detection rates increase as camels move through the value-chain and reaches its highest at abattoirs. It is likely that the infection is amplified as animals are brought to close proximities in markets and abattoirs. This study showed that examined adult camels in Egypt had higher seroprevalence (84%) and viral RNA (9.8%) compared to juvenile camels (16.1% and 1.7% respectively, p-value < 0.0001). Comparable investigations somewhere else likewise showed a higher seroprevalence in adult than in juvenile camels [24] . Our results showed that the overall seropositivity of camels in Tunisia was 87.3%. A previous study showed lower MERS-CoV seropositivity in adult (54%) and juvenile (30%) camels raised for meat production in Tunisia [15] . Our study showed 0.7% detection rate of MERS-CoV in nasal swabs of camels in Tunisia. The detection of MERS-CoV has been described in East African countries but none from Uganda. The results of this study showed that camels in Uganda have a rate of 66% of MERS-CoV antibodies. In Uganda, camels reside in eastern regions that share cultural and geographical characteristics with Kenya [25] . A previous study showed that camels in Kenya have a high seroprevalence rate of antibodies for MERS-CoV [26] .",

The dromedary camels in Senegal have 65.1% seroprevalence rate of antibody to MERS-CoV and 5.5% detection rate of genetic material of MERS-CoV suggesting that the virus is widespread in Senegal. In Iraq, camels reside in only four provinces: Anbar, Najaf, Basrah, and Muthanna. The overall seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in Iraq was 43.7%. In this study, serum samples were collected from only two provinces: Najaf and Muthanna. There was no significant difference in seropositivity to MERS-CoV between the two provinces in Iraq. There was no significant difference in seropositivity of MERS-CoV in serum samples collected from different regions in KSA. Previous studies carried out in KSA revealed regional difference in seropositivity to MERS-CoV ranged from 100% to 37% [27] . The virus detection rate in camels was detected in 3.1%. The main source of imported camels in KSA is Somalia and Sudan through the KSA Red Sea ports of Jizan and Jeddah.",

Previous studies found that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedaries in Egypt, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Morocco, and Ethiopia are genetically distinct from viruses in the Arabian Peninsula [28, 29] . Interestingly, the obtained sequences from infected camels with MERS-CoV in KSA were distinct from previously detected MERS-CoV in Arabian Peninsula and closely related to clade C of the African detected viruses. The detected viruses were from Al-Khomra near Jeddah. Most of camels in this region were imported from Sudan and Somalia suggesting the role of imported camels in the emerging of this clade into KSA. In contrast to data from a previous study [28] , the three obtained sequences from Senegal in West Africa were peculiarly related to cluster B circulating in Asia. It is important to note that those findings may have been affected by the relatively short sequenced fragment and full genome sequences of these samples will be more realistic.",

All juvenile camels in the Matrouh herd showed low antibody titer. Two Egyptian herds had evidence of MERS-CoV infection in state of the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies of some of infected camels. In contrast, a study of infection within camel herds including adult and juvenile camels showed seronegative juvenile camels exposed to viral infection more than seropositive adult animals [30] . A limitation of longitudinal study in Esna herd is the short period within which the sampling was carried out. No virus was detected in Jordan herd. Comparing the antibody titers among three herds, Jordan herd showed the highest seroprevalence titers without any significant drop in neutralizing antibodies. Data from this study showed that camels from Matrouh herd that were infected did not demonstrate a significant increase in titers. The source of infection is not clear. Another study limitation concerning longitudinal surveillance is the fact that the effect of seasonal climatic variation and difficulty to compare RNA activity between different sites impaired our capacity to draw uniform conclusions from all the sites. Another study limitation, urine, milk, and feces samples were not included in our study that give insights into MERS-CoV replication and virus shedding.",

The very high seroprevalence detected in camels warrants the initiation of an active surveillance study for MERS CoV in humans, particularly those that are at higher risks of exposure to MERS-CoV infections such as camel traders and abattoir workers.
