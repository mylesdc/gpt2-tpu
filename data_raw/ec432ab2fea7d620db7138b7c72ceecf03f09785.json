            "text": "There are no approved therapies for Ebola virus infection. Here, to find potential therapeutic targets, we perform a screen for genes essential for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. We identify GNPTAB, which encodes the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase. We show that EBOV infection of a GNPTAB knockout cell line is impaired, and that this is reversed by reconstituting GNPTAB expression. Fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis II, a disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB, are refractory to EBOV, whereas cells from their healthy parents support infection. Impaired infection correlates with loss of the expression of cathepsin B, known to be essential for EBOV entry. GNPTAB activity is dependent upon proteolytic cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P protease. Inhibiting this protease with the small-molecule PF-429242 blocks EBOV entry and infection. Disruption of GNPTAB function may represent a strategy for a host-targeted therapy for EBOV.",

In the cleaved form, GP CL , the receptorbinding site is exposed and interacts with the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).

In the latter study, Carette and colleagues used cells transduced with a gene-trapping retrovirus and infected them with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the EBOV glycoprotein. The surviving cells were expanded and their insertion sites mapped. NPC1 was the strongest hit in this screen, but other hits included genes from the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes; cathepsin B (CTSB) 15 ; the lipid kinase PIKFYVE 16 ; and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase alpha and beta subunits (GNPTAB). Another genome-wide screen used short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 cells, using lentivirus bearing the MARV glycoprotein 17 . These authors reported NPC1, VPS16 (a HOPS complex subunit), and cathepsin L (CTSL) as hits. A third screen used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) method in 293T cells with infectious EBOV, and identified NPC1, CTSB and HOPS complex subunits. In addition to genes important for endosome maturation (FIG4, PIKFYVE), the lysosomal protein BRI3, and RAB39B, a GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking were reported 18 . Finally, Martin and colleagues recently screened a siRNA library against an EBOV minigenome, a version of the genome with viral genes replaced by a reporter which is replicated by co-expressed viral proteins, to identify host factors important for replication and transcription in HEK293 cells 19 . This screen identified carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase (CAD) and the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway as being essential for EBOV replication and transcription.",

            "text": "Lysosomes mediate the degradation of extra-and intracellular material through an array of hydrolases, including proteases such as cathepsins 20 . Cathepsin B (CatB) is an essential factor for EBOV entry in cell culture, while cathepsin L (CatL) plays an accessory role. Together they mediate the stepwise cleavage of GP to GP CL 15 . Many proteins are transported to lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate pathway 21, 22 . N-acetylglucosamine-1phosphate transferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) is a Golgiresident enzyme that participates in the formation of mannose 6phosphate on the glycans of newly synthesized proteins, which are then recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors and transported to lysosomes. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is a 540 kiloDalton (kDa) heterotrimer with an \u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 \u03b3 2 structure; the GNPTAB gene encodes the \u03b1and \u03b2-subunits, whereas the \u03b3subunit is encoded by GNPTG. To be activated, the GNPTAB polypeptide must be cleaved into the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits by the cellular protease SKI-1/S1P 23, 24 . Low levels of GlcNAcphosphotransferase activity are associated with the LSD mucolipidosis 25 . In this slowly progressive metabolic disease, lysosomal hydrolases are improperly targeted and, rather than being trafficked to lysosomes, become secreted. Mucolipidosis type II (MLII), also called inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, is associated with variants in GNPTAB that result in little or no functional GlcNAcphosphotransferase 26 . Mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta (MLIII alpha/beta), also called pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, is associated with GNPTAB variants that retain some residual GlcNAcphosphotransferase activity. MLIII alpha/beta progresses more slowly and is generally less severe than MLII 27 . A third LSD, mucolipidosis type III gamma (MLIII gamma), is caused by variants in GNPTG 28 .",

Our screen identifies GNPTAB as a host factor for EBOV infection. This requirement is confirmed in primary cells from MLII and MLIII patients with defective GNPTAB variants.

To determine if GNPTAB has a role in EBOV infection, CRISPR genome editing was used to generate a clonal GNPTAB-knockout HAP1 cell line or, as a control, a NPC1-knockout cell line. Mutations in the gene of interest were confirmed by sequencing. Since the selection in our screen was based on the survival of transduced cells following EBOV infection, we first tested the viability of these cells after infection. The parental HAP1 cells, and GNPTAB \u2212 and NPC1 \u2212 derivatives, were infected and their viability was determined 6 days post infection. Due to EBOV-induced cytopathic effect, the viability of the parental HAP1 cells was reduced t\u00f5 25% of that of mock-infected cells, whereas the GNPTAB \u2212 and NPC1 \u2212 remained~90% viable after infection (Fig. 2a) . When these cells were infected with recombinant EBOV expressing the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen 33 (EBOV-ZsG), robust fluorescence was observed in parental HAP1 cells; fluorescence was lower in GNPTAB \u2212 cells, and lowest in NPC1 \u2212 cells (Fig. 2b ). This effect was not due to differences in cell growth, as mockinfected cultures had similar growth rates ( Supplementary Figure 1a) . We tested the ability of these cells to support infection by wild-type EBOV and found~170-fold less virus yield in GNPTAB \u2212 cells than in parental HAP1 cells ( To confirm a role for GNPTAB in EBOV infection, lentiviruses expressing GNPTAB with a C-terminal myc-tag (GNPTAB-myc), or \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) as a control, were used to transduce parental HAP1 or GNPTAB \u2212 cells. We did not detect endogenous GNPTAB (three different commercially available antibodies were tested), but could detect GNPTAB-myc in the appropriately transduced cell populations (Fig. 3a, b) . Each of the transduced cell lines still expressed NPC1 (Fig. 3b ). When infected with EBOV, the GNPTAB \u2212 cells transduced to express GUS (GNPTAB -+ GUS) remained refractory to EBOV-induced cell death, whereas the viability of those reconstituted with GNPTAB-myc was significantly reduced (Fig. 3c ). In addition, the GNPTAB-myc reconstituted cells supported infection by EBOV-ZsG, whereas infection remained impaired in cells transduced to express GUS (Fig. 3d) . The ability to support EBOV infection was not correlated with growth rate, as each grew similarly (Supplementary Figure 1b) . In addition, the growth of LASV-ZsG was similar in each of the reconstituted cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2c) . Altogether, our data indicate that GNPTAB is required for efficient EBOV infection of the haploid cell line HAP1.",

For each family, cells from the healthy mother and father as well as the proband MLII patient were tested. The characteristics of these cells have been described in detail previously 34 and are summarized in Table 3 . Fibroblasts from three apparently healthy patients (GM00038, GM05659, and GM05565) and from three patients with NP-C (GM17914, GM03123, and GM18411) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Each of the healthy control fibroblasts supported infection by EBOV-ZsG ( Fig. 4a -d, Supplementary Figure 3 ). In contrast, fibroblasts from 2 of the NP-C patients (GM17914 and GM18411) failed to support detectable EBOV replication (Fig. 4a , c). The third NP-C cell line (GM03123) supported a delayed, low level of infection (Fig. 4b ). This patient was compound heterozygous at the NPC1 allele, having the P237S and I1061T variants. While I1061T has been well characterized as associated with NP-C, the P237S variant was found to be non-pathogenic 35 , consistent with the reduced level of infection observed. When fibroblasts from families of MLII patients were infected, in each case, the maternal and paternal cells supported EBOV-ZsG infection, but the proband's cells did not ( Fig. 4a-c) . The level of infection in cells from each of the three MLII probands was comparable to that in cells from NP-C patients. The growth rate of the fibroblast cells did not correlate with their ability to support EBOV infection (Supplementary Figure 5 ). Fibroblasts from two MLII probands (GM01586 and GM03066) and three healthy control patients were infected with LASV-ZsG, AHFV or RVFV-GFP. The growth of AHFV and RVFV-GFP in the MLII proband cells was unimpaired, being similar to that in the healthy fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 6c & e). For LASV-ZsG, virus yield was similar in MLII and healthy fibroblasts for most of the time-course, but was modestly lower from the MLII cells at the day 4 time-point (Supplementary Figure 6a) . Overall, this suggests that the impaired growth of EBOV in these cells was not simply due to a generalized lack of support for viral infection.",

Since CatB is essential for Zaire-EBOV entry, we performed assays for CatB function using fluorescent substrate peptides that become dequenched after proteolysis. We used inhibitors of CatB (B i ) and CatL (L i ), to demonstrate that CatB activity was specifically detected. Lysates from the parental HAP1 cells and the NPC1 \u2212 knockout cells possessed robust CatB activity (Fig. 5b) that was inhibited by adding B i but not L i . In contrast, CatB activity was significantly lower in the GNPTAB \u2212 knockout cells (Fig. 5b) . CatB activity was restored by GNPTABmyc expression (Fig. 5c) .

First, we determined if PF-429242 could prevent cleavage of the GNPTAB precursor (PT-\u03b1\u03b2) to its alpha (PT-\u03b1) and beta subunits (PT-\u03b2). Cells transfected to express GNPTAB-myc and treated with increasing concentrations of PF-429242 exhibited less PT-\u03b1\u03b2 processing, as evidenced by a reduced amount of PT-\u03b2-myc (Fig. 6a ). PF-429242 had no effect on NPC1 expression levels (Fig. 6b) . We examined the effect of PF-429242 on EBOV-GPmediated entry using pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing the EBOV-GP (EBOVpp). The compound blocked EBOVpp entry with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) \u00b1 s.d. of 0.80 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5M (n = 3; Fig. 6c ), whereas the inhibition of particles pseudotyped with VSV-G protein (VSVpp; EC 50 = 12.80 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b5M, n = 3; Fig. 6c ) was similar to the effect on cell viability (Fig. 6d) .

We used authentic EBOV as the challenge virus. While this has benefits in recapitulating the genuine infection process, EBOV does have a propensity to form defective-interfering particles 41 which may cause false-positive hits. It should be noted that in addition to genes required for EBOV infection, genes required for the death of EBOV-infected cells should also be identified in our screen. The GNPTAB gene encodes the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of GlcNAcphosphotransferase, an enzyme that participates in the formation of mannose-6-phosphate on proteins to direct their transport to lysosomes. We confirmed the role of GNPTAB in EBOV infection in both HAP1 cells and primary fibroblasts from individuals with mucolipidosis, a genetic disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB. While GNPTAB is required for the correct localization of numerous lysosomal hydrolases, and we cannot exclude the involvement of other factors, lack of EBOV infection correlated with the loss of CatB activity, which is known to be required for EBOV entry. A model for the role of GNPTAB in EBOV entry is shown in Fig. 7 .",

We found that RESTV infection of GNPTABcells was impaired (Supplementary Figure 2g) , consistent with RESTV GP activation being dependent upon a lysosomal protease, transported there through the action of GNPTAB. Additional cysteine proteases are required even for viruses that use CatB, as viruses bearing precleaved glycoproteins remain sensitive to inhibition by E-64 [42] [43] [44] [45] .

Interestingly, wild-type, CTSB \u2212/\u2212 , and CTSL \u2212/\u2212 mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV 46 . This suggests that in vivo, at least for mouse-adapted EBOV in mice, GP may be cleaved by proteases other than CatB and CatL. This could be due to differences in the specificities of the different species' cathepsins, or may also be the case during human infection. One effect of modulating GNPTAB function may be the inactivation of multiple cathepsins, which, unlike a small molecule directed against a single cathepsin, might have the effect of blocking multiple filoviruses. We showed that GNPTABknockout reduced MARV infection, though not to the extent seen with EBOV (Supplementary Figure 2f) and also RESTVinfection (Supplementary Figure 2g) . Inhibition of GNPTAB would also be predicted to block infection by other viruses that require cathepsins, such as Nipah virus 47, 48 (Supplementary  Figure 2h) , SARS-coronavirus 49 , and reoviruses 50 . Cathepsins are thought to be involved in antigen processing, generating peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells [51] [52] [53] . Consequently, suppressing GNPTAB function may prevent the initiation of an adaptive immune response, though we have been unable to find any reference to immune suppression in the context of mucolipidosis patients. Clearly, for an antiviral strategy targeting GNPTAB, as with any therapy, the consequences for patient physiology need to be fully evaluated.",

            "text": "We found that PF-429242, an inhibitor of the SKI-1/S1P protease required for GNPTAB maturation, inhibited EBOV-GPmediated entry and EBOV infection. PF-429242 was originally developed to reduce cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, as SKI-1/ S1P is also responsible for processing sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins, which are major transcriptional regulators of cholesterol synthesis. PF-429242 inhibited SKI-1/S1P activity with an IC 50 of 0.2 \u00b5M and cholesterol synthesis with an EC 50 of 0.5 \u00b5M 36 . We recently demonstrated that the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins can suppress EBOV infection by interfering with proper GP processing 54 . Similarly, the cholesterol-reducing function of PF-429242 may also prevent correct GP glycosylation, and this mechanism may contribute to its anti-EBOV activity. Indeed, PF-429242 inhibits infection by a number of viruses in cell culture because SKI-1/S1P is required for the maturation of their glycoproteins 55, 56 or because they are dependent upon high levels of cellular cholesterol for entry 57 . The inactivation of GNPTAB and the improper trafficking of lysosomal proteins are additional mechanisms that may contribute to the antiviral activity of this compound. Notably, however, PF-429242 has a high clearance rate (75 mL/min/kg) and low oral availability (~5%) 36 , and failed to protect mice from severe fever upon challenge with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus 58 . Our data suggest that GNPTAB could be the subject of a hosttargeted anti-EBOV therapy. Using a compound like PF-429242 to block GNPTAB function, and consequently lysosomal cathepsin activities, should inhibit EBOV infection. Such treatment would essentially involve the deliberate induction of a LSD to prevent EBOV from entering via lysosomes, as has been suggested previously for suppression of NPC1. While GNPTAB deficiency is associated with mucolipidosis, the clinical manifestations occur much more slowly than the acute course of EBOV infection, and the risks of short-term GNPTAB inhibition may be outweighed by the benefits for a disease with a high case fatality rate. We found that fibroblasts from several patients with MLIII, the less severe form of mucolipidosis associated with residual levels of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity, did not efficiently support EBOV growth, suggesting that even a partial reduction in GNPTAB activity might be sufficient to reduce infection.",

Four days post transfection, the clarified medium for the transfected cells was passed onto fresh Huh7 monolayers. The medium from these cells was harvested 3 days later and titered on Huh7 cells. A stock was then generated following infection of Huh7 cells at an MOI of 0.005, to avoid the emergence of defectiveinterfering particles. The recombinant viruses EBOV-ZsG, LASV-ZsG, MARV-ZsG, NiV-ZsG, and RVFV-GFP, engineered with genes encoding fluorescent Pooled CRISPR screen. The pooled CRISPR screen was performed twice at a library coverage of~150\u00d7 each time. The GeCKO v2 library was gift from Feng Zhang, acquired from Addgene (#1000000048; Watertown, USA). VSV-Gpseudotyped GeCKOv2 lentiviruses were generated at the University of Michigan vector core. Each packaged GeCKOv2 A or B lentiviral half-library was used to transduce 16 million Huh7.5.1 cells as a MOI of 0.3 in 10-cm dishes 29 . After transduction, the cells were selected for 6 days with 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin, then frozen and transferred to CDC. Following revival of each half-library, 10 7 transduced cells were infected with wild-type EBOV (Mayinga strain) at an MOI of 0.3. Three days post infection, the cells were passaged at a 1:5 ratio. Surviving cells were expanded, and lysed in TriPure (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), to inactivate EBOV present in the sample. The lysates were then transferred from BSL-4 containment to a BSL-2 laboratory and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the TriPure method. The sgRNA sequences were amplified in two sequential PCR reactions, both using Herculase II enzyme (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). For the first reaction, for gDNA from EBOV-selected cells and from input library cells, 13 replicate 100 \u00b5L reactions were set up, each with 10 \u00b5g of extracted gDNA, and products were amplified over 18 cycles using primers PCR#1-forward and -reverse (listed in Supplementary Virus assays. For assays to measure EBOV-induced CPE, HAP1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well of a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were infected with wildtype EBOV (strain Mayinga) at an MOI of 0.3. Three days post-infection (p.i.), cells were trypsinized and passed at 1:10 ratio into an opaque white 96-well plate. Six days p.i. cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, USA). For time-courses using the fluorescent reporter viruses, EBOV-ZsG, LASV-ZsG, and RVFV-GFP, HAP1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells, or fibroblasts at 3000 cells, per well of an opaque 96-well plate. The following day, HAP1 cells were infected with EBOV-ZsG virus at an MOI of 0.1 or fibroblasts were infected at an MOI of 1 (titer being determined using the healthy control fibroblasts GM05659). Fluorescence, representing the intensity within the infected cells, was measured over time using a Synergy H1MD plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). For timecourses measuring viral titers, HAP1 cells were seeded and infected as for the fluorescent viruses, with samples of the culture medium quantified for virus titers by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assays in Vero E6 cells by the method of Reed and Muench.",

Yields of AHFV were slightly reduced from one of the three tested MLIII proband cells (GM02065), but the growth of AHFV in the other two was indistinguishable from that in the healthy control fibroblasts (SupplementaryFigure 6d).Overall, these data with primary fibroblast cells from both MLII and MLIII patients are consistent with a requirement for GNPTAB in EBOV infection of human cells.GNPTAB knockout correlates with loss of cathepsin activity.

(1) The SKI-1/S1P protease cleaves the GNPTAB precursor to yield the individual \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which then assemble with the \u03b3 subunit to form the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase enzyme. (2) GlcNAc-phosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of mannose-6-phosphate onto the glycans of proteins destined to be transported to the lysosome, such as pro-cathepsin B and pro-cathepsin L.(3) The mannose-6-phosphate receptor recognizes its substrates and mediates their transport to the lysosome. (4) Once in the lysosome, pro-cathepsins cleave to yield the mature cathepsins.(5)The activated cathepsins cleave the EBOV GP, removing the glycan-cap and mucin-like domains, and allowing the receptor-binding site to interact with NPC1, priming the GP for fusion. (6) Following fusion, the viral nucleocapsid enters into the cell cytoplasm where replication can be initiated.
