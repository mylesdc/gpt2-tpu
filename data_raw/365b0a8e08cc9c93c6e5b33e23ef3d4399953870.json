In addition, to assess the physical and mental status of the participants, self-rated health status, chronic disease status (hypertension, diabetes) and daily life stress level were surveyed (S2 and S3 Files). The Survey conducted by classified age groups: '19-29', 'thirties', 'forties', 'fifties', 'over sixties'. In this analysis, Age groups are categorized as 'under 29', 'over thirty under forty' and 'over fifty' following by precedent study [9] . The Survey answer types of a education level were classified in 'below middle school graduation', 'high school graduation', 'College student or graduation' and 'graduate school student or graduation'. In this analysis, Education levels are categorized as 'below high school graduation', 'College student or graduation', and 'graduate school student or graduation'. The classification needed is necessary in this study because the college entrance rate is high (approximately 70%) in Korea. The Survey answer types of an occupation were categorized in 'Agriculture/Fishing/Forestry/Animal Husbandry', 'Self- employment', 'Sales/Service', 'Technical engineer/Skilled labor', 'Simple labor(Production employee, Sweeper, Janitor etc.)', 'Office job(Office worker, Public officer etc.)', 'Manager', 'Specialized job(Lawyer, Doctor, Architect, Professor etc.)', 'Housewife', 'Student' and 'unemployed'. In this analysis, the three of occupations: 'office job', 'Manager' and 'specialized job' are classified as a white collar worker. 'Housewife', 'student' and 'unemployed' are classified as an 'unemployed'. The other occupations are classified as a blue collar worker. The Survey answer types of medical insurance status were categorized in 'Regional medical insurance', 'Workplace medical insurance' and 'Medical Aid'. In this analysis, medical insurance statuses are categorized in 'Medical insurance' or 'Medical Aid'. The Survey answer types of income per a month were categorized in 'Below 1,000$', '1,000$-2,000$', '2,000$-3,000$', '3,000$-4,000$', '4,000$-5,000$', '5,000$-6,000$', 'Over 6,000$'. In this analysis, incomes are categorized in 'Under 2,000$', '2,000 $-4,000$', '4,000$-6,000$', 'Over 6,000$' following by income quartile in Korea. The five-point scale survey conducted on Self-rated health status followed by quartile of income status in Korea.

As these studies used different instruments from the ones used in this study, it couldn't be compared directly. However, the overall trend showed higher levels of worry than the MERSrelated worry found in the present this study. In a study conducted in the Netherlands, a fivepoint scale was used to investigate the level of worry, just as that used in the present study [9] . In that study, 36% of the respondents reported feeling worried to very worried in 36%, a rate higher than the 9.2% of worried to very worried responses during the first period (index case observed) in the present study. In a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, the level of concern was investigated at three intervals, and a relatively high response 'extremely concerned' (54.3%) was observed among respondents [11] . A study conducted in Malaysia and Europe investigated the levels of concern in four intervals and found that 26% and 25% felt very concerned and somewhat concerned, respectively [12] .",

First, the group that responded as having very good self-rated health status had confidence in their physical health, thereby having a lower perceived susceptibility than the other groups. The second reason may be attributed to differences in the level of trust in informal information. According to a precedent study, having greater trust in informal information correlates with increased levels of disease-related worry [15] . The group that reported having very good self-rated health status had greater interest in health than the other groups; as a result, they may have increased interest in the situation involving the MERS outbreak and acquiring more information on the disease and methods for its prevention. Because of this, they had less trust in informal information, which can result in lower levels of MERS-related worry.",

The level of worry then decreased at the point of outbreak ending. The reliability test results showed statistically significantly consistent for scores from all four periods.

According to a study from the Netherlands conducted during an influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the level of worry was highest in the initial stage, after which the level decreased and was maintained at a consistently low level. A study from Hong Kong also indicated that the level of perceived worry was high initially, but continued to decrease thereafter. The reason for these somewhat conflicting results in comparison to precedent studies is because the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak was touted early on by the government as a very serious disease, which resulted in high levels of worry. However, as people gradually realized that the disease was not much different than any previous influenza outbreaks, the level of worry decreased accordingly [10, 16] . In contrast, in the early stage of MERS outbreak in Korea, it was announced that the disease was not any more serious than other influenzas; however, the increasing number of infected patients and mortalities is believed to have resulted in increased levels of worry. These findings can be used as evidence that effectively reducing the level of worry in the population during the early stage would result in a persistently low level of worry.",

Therefore, continual checking the spatial spread of disease at the every stage is helpful to disease-related worry intervention [18] . According to the Suggestion from the precedent study that analyzing the MERS epidemic in Korea through mathematical model, the interventions; limiting the theatrical performances such as rallies and fairs, publishing information on diseases at appropriate times and distributing them to the local community could also be helpful to manage of disease.

First, the present study was a cross-sectional study; as such, it may contain recall bias, which can especially influence the level of MERSrelated worry during key outbreak periods. Because the worry scores for the four different periods were surveyed simultaneously, approximately three months had elapsed from the time of the index case to when the survey was conducted; therefore, the levels of worry during the corresponding periods may not have been recalled accurately, thereby resulting in inaccurate responses. Future studies should conduct prospective surveys throughout the duration of infection outbreaks in order to more accurately assess the levels of disease-related worry during key outbreak periods. Second, emotional responses to epidemics can be assessed using various questions. Besides the experienced worry assessed in the present study, various other questions, including anxiety level, may offer a deeper understanding of the emotional responses to epidemics.",

The factors that decreased the level of MERS-related worry were being men and having very good self-rated health status, whereas having very high daily life stress increased the level of worry. These findings were to suggest that the level of worry increased among those with higher perceived susceptibility and with greater trust in informal information. Moreover, with respect to the levels of worry according to MERS outbreak periods, the level of worry in the initial stage was closely associated with the levels during the stages that followed. This observation underscores the importance of managing the level of worry in the early stage of outbreaks through proper intervention. Therefore, for proper disease management, it is necessary to make efforts to reduce the level of perceived susceptibility by disseminating timely and accurate information on disease prevention measures and current status through formal routes in the early stage of the outbreak, in addition to reducing the level of worry in the early stage by blocking distribution of informal information. For this, it is helpful to outbreak control by publishing disease information at the appropriate time and distributing it to the community, and to educate each group about disease prevention in a personalized manner.
