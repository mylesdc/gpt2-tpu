HBoV1 was detected in 127 children (10.3%), in which 66/127 (52%) of the cases were the only HBoV1 virus detected. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 infection rate in summer. A cutoff value of 10 7 copies/mL was used to distinguish high and low HBoV1 viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents (28/39, 71.8%) whereas there was primarily co-detection in cases of low HBoV1 viral loads (50/88, 56.8%). There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity between HBoV1 single detection and co-detection. In cases of HBoV1 single detection, the high viral load group was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was the low viral load group (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between high viral load and low viral load groups. Of the HBoV1 positive patients associated with severe respiratory tract infections, 10/18 (55.6%) patients belonged to the HBoV1 high viral load group, and 7/10 (70%) patients had cases of HBoV1 single detection.",

Jacques reported that HBoV at a high viral load could be an etiological agent of respiratory tract disease [4] . The patients positive only for HBoV predominantly constituted the high viral load group, whereas most of the HBoV-positive patients with infection caused by other respiratory viruses belonged to the low viral load group [4] [5] [6] . Martin reported that HBoV positivity did not consistently correspond with the onset of respiratory illness, and its load did not correlate with the severity of illness [7] . Recent results obtained by quantitative realtime PCR suggest that high HBoV viral loads (defined as > 10 6 copies/mL) are frequently present as the sole viral finding for children admitted for RTI [4, 5, 8] . However, the role of HBoV as a causative agent in severe respiratory tract infections (SRTI) is unclear.",

The incidence and clinical presentation of this infection varies widely, and often involves co-infection with other potential pathogens [9] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most prevalent pathogen associated with HBoV in all the studies [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Such characteristics have led to debate over the role of HBoV as a true pathogen. Therefore, additional evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to gain a better understanding of this virus. We investigated whether HBoV1 at a high viral load increases the severity of RTI and whether co-detection with HBoV1 and another respiratory virus or viruses increases the severity of concurrent viral detection. We study the prevalence of HBoV1 and the genome of the HBoV1 load in respiratory tract specimens from children hospitalized for RTI to investigate the association between HBoV1 detection and SRTI. This article might increase our understanding of the role of HBoV1 in SRTI.",

We conducted this study for nearly 4 consecutive years, and samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and viral culture. The HBoV1 viral load was quantified by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results suggest that HBoV1 at a high viral load (\u226510 7 copies/mL) is not co-detected frequently with other respiratory viruses; there would be an association between HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load and SRTI. This study investigated the role of HBoV1 in RTI and found that 10.3% of the children with RTI were HBoV1 positive in the NPAs. Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of HBoV1 in respiratory tract samples of children world wide [7, 21, 22] . Some reports indicate that HBoV1 infection is associated with acute respiratory tract symptoms and that a high HBoV1 load (\u226510 7 copies/mL) is associated with SRTI [14, 23] . In this study, HBoV1 low load was found significantly more frequently in children than was HBoV1 with a high viral load. The cases of SRTI in the patients with HBoV1 detection alone appeared to be particularly common among children with a high HBoV1 load. The stratification of the patients on the basis of the HBoV1 viral load \u226510 7 copies/mL versus <10 7 copies/mL in NPAs revealed that the presence of HBoV1 single detection at high (\u226510 7 copies/mL)-but not at low (<10 7 copies/mL)-viral loads is associated with SRTI. Similarly, a case report described HBoV detection leading to SRTI [24] . Zhao found an association between disease severity and the HBoV1 viral load in co-detection children [14] . Our study reported an association between the HBoV1 high viral load and SRTI in single detection children. We confirmed HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load in 7 children. Two of them received treatment in ICU, including ventilator In most of the previous studies, the co-detection rate ranged from 18-72% [25] . In this study, of the HBoV1 positive samples, 48% were co-detected with other respiratory viruses (HBoV1-RV in 37 children, followed by HBoV1-ADV in 16 children and HBoV1-RSV in 13 children). This result is consistent with more recent studies. Martin reported that 35.3% of HBoV cases were co-infected, and 83.3% of them were HBoV-RSV coinfection [7] . Another study reported that RSV and RV were most frequently detected in conjunction with HBoV1 [26] , and ADV and enterovirus were more common in children with HBoV [5] . We compared HBoV1 single detection and co-detection, and the median level of HBoV1 load was greater in the subjects with HBoV1 infection alone than in the subjects with mixed respiratory viral infections. There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity. Co-detection with HBoV1 did not increase the severity of RTI. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents, whereas co-detections were primarily found in low viral load cases. In severe cases, HBoV1 single detection was more prevalent among the children with a high viral load than those with a low viral load.",

Allander suggested a model for HBoV infection in which high viral loads are potentially associated with respiratory symptoms, and low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding [3] . In our study, a portion of patients with HBoV1 single detections at low viral load suffered from acute respiratory tract disease. What's more, Schildgen suggested that HBoV may indirectly contribute to the development of some colorectal and lung cancers or may play an active role in cancer by interacting with the host genome [30] . Thus, it is hard to make a conclusion that a portion of HBoV single detections with low copy number is always accompanied by a lack of symptoms.

            "text": "In conclusion, HBoV1 is a prevalent virus commonly detected in hospitalized children with RTI especially in children below 2 years of age. During the study period, the high detection of HBoV1 was predominantly in May-August and November-January. Of the HBoV1 single detection cases, the high viral load group was more prevalent than the low viral load group among the children with dyspnea and wheezing. The disease severity in the high viral load group was greater than the severity of the low viral load group. The 7 cases reported here suggest that a lower respiratory tract infection caused by HBoV1 single detection at a high viral load (\u226510 7 copies/ mL) could lead to severe and life-threatening disease. HBoV1 could in some cases be a passenger in RTI, primarily in the low viral load group. HBoV1 co-detection with other respiratory viruses did not increase the severity of RTI. However, the role of HBoV1 detection in SRTI merits further study. ",

The PCR results were positive for \u22651 virus in 652 (53.1%) children. The viral culture results were positive for \u22651 virus in 288 (23.4%) children. Notably, 266 (21.6%) of the patients had positive test results for \u2265 2 viruses. Seasonal distribution of HBoV1 Between December 2009 and August 2013, 127 patients (10.3%) tested positive for HBoV1 in the NPAs. HBoV1 was the only virus detected in 66 patients (5.4% of all the patients and 52% of the HBoV1-positive patients). The pathogen spectrum is shown in Figure 1. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 detection rate in summer. The seasonal distribution of HBoV1 and the positive rate in each season are shown in Figure 2.",
