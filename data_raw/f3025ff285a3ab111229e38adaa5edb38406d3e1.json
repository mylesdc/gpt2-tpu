This expanded framework allows for the incorporation of additional information, such as contact tracing or household data, through prior distributions. The results for the R\u2080 and the SI from the influenza outbreak in South Africa were similar regardless of the prior information (R 0 = 1.36-1.46,m = 2.0-2.7,m = mean of the SI). The estimates of R\u2080 and \u03bc for the SARS outbreak ranged from 2.0-4.4 and 7.4-11.3, respectively, and were shown to vary depending on the use of contact tracing data. The impact of the contact tracing data was likely due to the small number of SARS cases relative to the size of the contact tracing sample.",

            "text": "When an infectious disease outbreak occurs, public health officials need to understand the dynamics of disease transmission in order to launch an effective response. Two quantities that are often used to describe transmission are the basic reproductive number and the distribution of the serial interval (SI). The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population [1] . The reproductive number is always nonnegative; values less than one are indicative of an outbreak that will not continue to grow in the absence of imported cases. When R 0 is larger than one, the magnitude of the value guides the types of control measures that are necessary to restrict transmission and control the outbreak. It is also essential to understand the timing between primary and secondary cases. For a given R 0 , if secondary cases occur shortly after the primary cases, a rapidly growing outbreak will result, which can be more difficult to control than an outbreak with a longer time interval between cases. The timing of the secondary cases is most easily measured by the SI distribution, an observable quantity. The SI is defined as the time between symptom onset in successive cases in a chain of backward transmission. The SI is used as a surrogate measure for the generation interval, which is unobservable, and is defined as the time between consecutive infections in the chain of transmission [2] . R 0 and the SI distribution provide important information that is used to initiate an appropriate public health response to an infectious disease outbreak.",

Typically, the SI distribution is estimated using contact tracing or household data (see for example [4] [5] ); however, these studies are often small and subject to potential bias and errors in recall by participants. White and Pagano [6] introduced a novel approach to simultaneously estimate the R 0 and the SI using only data from the epidemic curve. In recent years Bayesian methods have been developed to estimate transmission parameters, and can be particularly useful in instances with sparse data or when prior data about an outbreak exists; however these types of models have often been limited to Bayesian evidence synthesis or compartmental models [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Becker et al. [13] introduced a Bayesian framework to estimate R 0 and the SI distribution by augmenting the likelihood function, introduced by White and Pagano, with independent observations of the SI from contact tracing data, and obtained posterior estimates through MCMC methods. They also made recommendations about the number of observations from the epidemic curve and contact tracing sample needed to obtain reliable estimates for R 0 and the SI distribution.",

In the absence of prior information, we want to select hyperparameters for the Dirichlet prior such that the distribution will be noninformative [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . We examined different priors such as Jeffrey's prior, which assigns 0.5 for all values of \u03b1 i , and the Bayes-Laplace prior, which assigns 1 to all \u03b1 i values. We found that using hyperparameters that are less than 1 can result in a lack of convergence or poor mixing. Because of this, when no additional information about the SI distribution is available, we select the Bayes-Laplace prior. This choice is not noninformative, as it imposes a uniform distribution on the prior, but it is reasonable for outbreaks where there are no contact tracing samples. This prior will be referred to as the uniform prior in the following sections. When additional information is available, such as contact tracing from initial cases, we can inform the prior distribution with these observations. The hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution can be updated with the number of observed serial intervals corresponding to each day of the SI. Previously, Becker et al. [13] incorporated this information by augmenting it with the likelihood (in equation 1) and used a Bayes-Laplace prior distribution for the SI (see equation 3). Our approach directly informs the SI prior distribution with the observed SIs, which enables us to guide the estimation of the SI by weighting each day of the SI according to the observed serial intervals. The Bayesian model considers the prior information in the estimation, but still puts emphasis on the epidemic curve (daily incidence data).",

            "text": "Simulation Conclusions. When contact tracing samples are available this data should be used to inform the SI prior distribution. Careful thought should be given to the size of the prior relative to the total outbreak size and length. For smaller outbreaks it is especially important to make sure that the contact tracing sample size is not too large, which could potentially bias the estimates. If enough generations of transmission have been observed to properly estimate a SI of a given maximum length k, then the SI prior should be weighted to be no more 4% of the total outbreak size; however, a range of weights could be considered to examine the robustness of the results. When total outbreak lengths are limited, weighting the SI prior to be 1-2% of the total outbreak size may be more appropriate. If contact tracing data is not available then a range of possible models with reasonable choices of k should be considered. The choice of k can be determined by prior knowledge of similar outbreaks or general knowledge about the pathogen. Each model can be analyzed using a uniform prior distribution for the SI and the models can be compared using the DIC (or other model assessment tool). Smallest DICs indicate best fit, which can be used to narrow down the best model and value for k. These estimates can also be updated and confirmed as the outbreak continues and more cases are observed. Table 3 . Five separate MCMC analyses were conducted, each with a different SI prior distribution, as well as two additional analyses using the White and Pagano method. The first three MCMC analyses were performed using the informative priors shown in Fig. 2 , and are composed of the actual number of observed serial intervals from the contact tracing samples, which corresponds to 0.8-1.5% of the total outbreak size. The confirmed influenza-like illness cases have a maximum SI length of five days, while the probable cases have a maximum length of six days. Two uniform prior distributions were included, with five and six day maximum SI lengths, chosen to match the lengths of contact tracing samples. To assess if these models (choices of k) are appropriate, additional models with varying values of k, using uniform priors, were also included. Values of k that were considered ranged from k = 5 to 20, with model comparison done via the DIC (Table 4) . R 0 was estimated between 1.36-1.46 for when using the priors based on observed SIs from contact tracing, which is consistent with other estimates from South Africa [27, 31] . The estimates for the average serial interval range from 2.00-2.66 days. Slightly larger posterior estimates for \u03bc and R 0 are observed for the analyses with a six-day maximum SI length, but overall the results are similar between approaches. The results from the White and Pagano maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. The MLEs for the five-day SI and six-day SI areR 0 = 1.36 and 1.47, andm = 2.07 and 2.70, respectively. The confidence intervals for White and Pagano are wider than the credible intervals obtained from the Bayesian approach, but otherwise they are similar.",

The Hong Kong results are slightly different than those from Singapore, but a similar trend is seen when including contact tracing data. Our estimates for R 0 (2.02 for the informative prior; 2.78 for the uniform prior) are smaller than what Wallinga and Teunis calculated (R t = 3.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.2). The estimates from White and Pagano are substantially larger, especially for Singapore, which is likely to be due to the small sample size and large number of parameters. The 95% confidence intervals estimates are also wide. The results from the analysis of the Singapore data should be interpreted with caution given the limited outbreak size and short total epidemic length. The Hong Kong outbreak was larger than Singapore, but was still limited in terms of total length and was not substantially larger than the contact tracing sample size; the contact tracing sample size was 27% of the total outbreak size. We would recommend down weighting the contact tracing sample in the prior in this instance, but due to the large k this may not be feasible. The simplest prior we consider is the uniform prior and with k = 20 this is already equivalent to 3% of the total outbreak size, implying that any informative prior would be weighted to be at least 3% of the total outbreak size. Because of this, the uniform prior may be most appropriate for this analysis.",

This framework allows for the inclusion of additional data sources beyond Disease Transmissibility Estimates with Bayesian Tools the epidemic curve through the prior distributions. We explored including a contact tracing sample or household study data with simulations and in the analysis of real outbreak data. The South African H1N1 outbreak is an example of a large outbreak in which the epidemic curve contains many cases spread over time. We explored including the contact tracing sample with and without weighting the observed SIs in the prior. Using the contact tracing sample as is, which was equivalent to 0.8%-1.5% of the total outbreak size, led to similar results for the posterior estimates. When we increased the weight of the contact tracing sample to be more influential (27% of the total outbreak size), the estimates were impacted. The increase in prior information led to a slight increase in the estimates of the reproductive number and the mean of the serial interval (results shown in Table S13 in S3 Appendix). The posterior mean of \u03bc was almost identical to the prior mean, which indicates that a heavily weighted prior can bias the posterior results. For the SARS outbreak in Singapore and Hong Kong the contact tracing sample size was much larger relative to the number of cases in epidemic curve, which also impacted our results. Here, when we informed the SI prior distribution with contact tracing data, the posterior estimates of R 0 and \u03bc decreased, and the posterior estimate of \u03bc was similar to the prior mean (mean of the contact tracing sample). This decrease in the estimates is likely related to the timing of the contact tracing sample collection and of the implementation of control measures, and is attributable to including a large contact tracing sample from a different phase of the outbreak. The results from the outbreak analyses support the work of Kenah et al. [32] , in which they show that when the prevalence of an infection is lower, the serial interval should be larger.",

We demonstrated through simulation and in the analysis of H1N1 in South Africa and SARS in Hong Kong, that the DIC can be utilized to select the best model and value of k.

When outbreak sizes were small and reproductive numbers were large we observed short epidemic lengths, such as when N = 50 and R 0 = 6 we only observe epidemic lengths of four to five days for an SI with maximum length five and saw that R 0 is underestimated. For simulations based on larger values of the reproductive number the results were varied; the best results were observed for large epidemic sizes. Outbreaks based on smaller reproductive numbers resulted in better posterior estimates regardless of outbreak size. Griffin et al. [33] notes that estimation is better when cases are spread over many generations, as opposed to having more individuals in fewer generations, as is likely to occur with a large reproductive number. We also observed that not only is the total number of observed cases important, but also when these cases appear [13] . The issues with estimating the parameters with the larger R 0 could be resolved by allowing the epidemic curve to cover more generations of data (larger N). In fact, one is unlikely to begin such an analysis for outbreak that has only been occurring over so few days. Additional information about the reproductive number that could be used to inform its prior distribution could potentially improve this issue as well.

Our findings support those seen in Becker et al. [13] , in which they conclude that having only 10 additional observations on the SI can substantially improve estimation. We also showed through simulation that our method is comparable to the Becker approach. When no contact tracing data is available the methods are mathematically equivalent, and when we incorporate observations on the SI the two approaches are very similar.
