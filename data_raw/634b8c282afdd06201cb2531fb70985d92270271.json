            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) replication and transcription are carried out in close proximity to restructured endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in replication/transcription complexes (RTC). Many of the CoV nonstructural proteins (nsps) are required for RTC function; however, not all of their functions are known. nsp15 contains an endoribonuclease domain that is conserved in the CoV family. While the enzymatic activity and crystal structure of nsp15 are well defined, its role in replication remains elusive. nsp15 localizes to sites of RNA replication, but whether it acts independently or requires additional interactions for its function remains unknown. To begin to address these questions, we created an in situ tagged form of nsp15 using the prototypic CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In MHV, nsp15 contains the genomic RNA packaging signal (P/S), a 95-bp RNA stem-loop structure that is not required for viral replication or nsp15 function. Utilizing this knowledge, we constructed an internal hemagglutinin (HA) tag that replaced the P/S. We found that nsp15-HA was localized to discrete perinuclear puncta and strongly colocalized with nsp8 and nsp12, both welldefined members of the RTC, but not the membrane (M) protein, involved in virus assembly. Finally, we found that nsp15 interacted with RTC-associated proteins nsp8 and nsp12 during infection, and this interaction was RNA independent. From this, we conclude that nsp15 localizes and interacts with CoV proteins in the RTC, suggesting it plays a direct or indirect role in virus replication. Furthermore, the use of in situ epitope tags could be used to determine novel nsp-nsp interactions in coronaviruses.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE Despite structural and biochemical data demonstrating that the coronavirus nsp15 protein contains an endoribonuclease domain, its precise function during coronavirus infection remains unknown. In this work, we created a novel in situ tagged form of nsp15 to study interactions and localization during infection. This in situ tag was tolerated by MHV and did not affect viral replication. Utilizing this tag, we established that nsp15 localized to sites of replication but not sites of assembly throughout infection. Furthermore, we found that nsp15 interacted with the putative viral primase nsp8 and polymerase nsp12 during CoV infection. The strong association of nsp15 with replication complexes and interactions with replicative CoV enzymes suggest nsp15 is involved in CoV replication. These data and tools developed in this study help elucidate the function of nsp15 during infection and may be used to uncover other novel viral protein interactions.",

Generally, human coronavirus (CoV) infections cause mild disease with upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast, two human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, recently emerged from zoonotic sources into the human population and caused severe respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality rates (1) (2) (3) . After the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002 to 2003, efforts were made to better understand CoV replication and to develop therapies and vaccines to reduce CoV-mediated morbidity and mortality. These efforts expanded our understanding of the structure and function of several CoV proteins and of CoV replication; however, there are many aspects of the replication cycle that require further investigation (4) .",

The nsps then establish a replication/transcription complex (RTC) on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, which have been restructured by viral transmembrane proteins (5, 6) .

            "text": "nsp15 contains a conserved uridine-specific endoribonuclease domain with an unknown function in CoV infection (20, 21) . The endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 is conserved in CoVs and arteriviruses, but is not conserved among other nidoviruses (roniviruses and mesoniviruses) (22, 23) . This lack of conservation raises the possibility that nsp15 does not function only in virus replication, but rather is also involved in immune evasion or another host-specific function. nsp15 forms a homohexamer, which is required for RNA binding and cell-free cleavage assays (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . CoVs and arteriviruses with endoribonuclease catalytic mutations have reduced levels of replication, as assessed by levels of infectious virus, gRNA, and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA); these effects are more pronounced in arteriviruses than in CoVs (29, 30) . nsp15 was shown to colocalize with replicating RNA, but its precise localization throughout infection, interactions with other viral proteins, and physiological role are poorly understood (10) . nsp15 also contains the only known RNA packaging signal (termed \"P/S\" herein) in lineage A \u2424-CoVs; this signal has been partially characterized and contains a stem-loop structure. We took advantage of the known structure of the P/S to introduce an epitope tag into nsp15 that would be useful for subsequent studies. Due to their cleavage from a larger polyprotein, N-and C-terminal nsp epitope tags are not always feasible. It was previously reported that an epitope tag inserted into the native location of nsp4 was lethal to the virus; however, the virus was viable if the epitopetagged-nsp4 was expressed as an sgRNA (11) . Notable exceptions include green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged nsp2 (31, 32) , which is not required for replication (33) , and GFP-nsp3 (32) , which results in significant virus attenuation. To circumvent these problems, we inserted an influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag into the P/S of MHV strain A59 (rA59 Nsp15-HA ). This HA tag was predicted to be useful for identification of protein-protein interactions and localization during infection.",

To study the role of nsp15 during infection and address whether nsp15 interacts with other viral proteins, we constructed an in situ tagged form of nsp15 in MHV. Current antibodies used for the study of MHV nsps are limited to rabbit polyclonal sera. In many cases, these antibodies have significant background binding to host proteins, limiting their downstream applications. To circumvent this barrier, we constructed an HA-tagged form of nsp15 in MHV. In MHV, nsp15 contains the P/S, which is an ideal site for in situ tag insertion. The P/S, which forms a conserved stem-loop structure (Fig. 1A , left), is conserved among lineage A \u2424-coronaviruses but not other closely related \u2424-coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV) (Fig. 1C) (38) . Studies have demonstrated that the P/S can be deleted from MHV without causing significant growth defects (36) . Finally, the amino acids encoded by the P/S are predicted to form a flexible loop, which is surface exposed on the monomer and hexamer of nsp15 ( Fig. 1B) (24) . With these characteristics in mind, we decided to design our in situ epitope tags around the MHV P/S. Initially, we replaced 66 bp of the P/S with that of a 3\u03ebFLAG sequence, rA59 Nsp15-FLAG (Fig. 1A , right). We were able to rescue recombinant virus but were unable to detect any FLAG-specific signal by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence. Sequence analyses of the P/S revealed a near complete deletion of the 3\u03ebFLAG sequence from these viruses during initial virus replication after 5 passages (data not shown). The 3\u03ebFLAG tag was likely unsuccessful due to large differences predicted in the secondary structure and Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of the rA59 WT and the 3\u03ebFLAG-containing P/S (Fig. 1A , right). Considering these data, we set out to create an internal tag that maintained a stem-loop structure in the P/S more closely mimicking the wild-type stem-loop. To achieve this, we inserted the HA tag sequence into the ascending stem of the P/S and its complement into the descending stem of the P/S, creating rA59 Nsp15-HA (Fig. 1A , middle, C). A recombinant virus containing this HA tag was created using an in vitro ligation system as previously described (39) .",

Subsequently, each passage was analyzed for the presence of the in situ HA epitope tag by immunoblotting. nsp15-HA protein levels did not diminish over 5 passages (Fig. 2F ), suggesting the in situ HA tag was stable over multiple passages, unlike the in situ 3\u03ebFLAG tag. rA59 Nsp15-HA has similar replication kinetics to rA59 WT .

Furthermore, amounts of both nsp8 and N proteins were equivalent in rA59 Nsp15-HAand rA59 WT -infected 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 2C ). From these data, we conclude that insertion of an HA tag into the P/S within nsp15 did not substantially affect virus replication in vitro.",

During our investigation of viral growth kinetics, we noted that rA59 Nsp15-HA had significantly increased levels of sgRNA at 2 hpi. We hypothesized that this increase in sgRNA levels was too early to be due to sgRNA transcription and attributed it to increased packaging of sgRNA into virions by rA59 Nsp15-HA . This would be in agreement with previous reports, which demonstrated that P/S mutants altered selective gRNA packaging, so that sgRNA was now incorporated into virions, but did not affect viral replication (36) . To determine the efficiency of selective packaging in rA59 Nsp15-HA , we measured the ratio of sgRNA (sgRNAs 4, 5, 6, and 7) to gRNA in virus isolated from infected cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation. Our results showed that viral RNA obtained from rA59 Nsp15-HAinfected cell supernatants had at least a 25-fold increase in the sgRNA/gRNA ratio (Fig. 3A) . Previous work demonstrated that P/S mutants and wild-type virus have identical growth kinetics, but P/S mutants are readily outcompeted by rA59 WT when cells are dually infected (36) . In order to test whether the rA59 Nsp15-HA virus would be outcompeted by rA59 WT virus, cells were infected with 1:1 or 3:1 mixtures of rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 WT at a total MOI of 0.1. This low MOI was used to ensure that only a small number of cells would be infected by both viruses. At 16 hpi, progeny viruses were collected and subsequently used for both immunoblotting and further passaging. The rA59 Nsp15-HA was rapidly outcompeted by rA59 WT , as nsp15-HA signal was greatly diminished by passages 2 and 3 for 1:1 and 3:1 infection ratios, respectively (Fig. 3B ). Taken together, these data indicated that while rA59 Nsp15-HA replicates normally, the HA insertion significantly hampers its capacity to selectively package gRNA over sgRNA, diminishing its competitive advantage. This suggests that while the in situ tag maintained a stem-loop within this region of nsp15, it slightly attenuated the virus by likely altering the primary sequence of the P/S or the internal secondary structure of the RNA in this region or, possibly, a function of nsp15.",

Previously, it was shown that nsp15 localizes with replicating viral RNA (10), potentially to replication compartments and with RTC members. To confirm that nsp15 was in fact localized to RTCs and to expand upon these results, we investigated the colocalization of nsp15 with nsp8 and nsp12 throughout infection. nsp8 and nsp12, the proposed viral primase and RdRp, respectively, are both established members of the replication complex and often used as markers for RTC localization (8, 9) . Following infection with either rA59 Nsp15-HA or rA59 WT , 17Cl-1 cells were fixed at indicated time points throughout infection and then costained with anti-HA and anti-nsp8 or anti-nsp12 antibody. nsp15 strongly colocalized with both nsp8 and nsp12 in rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells throughout infection (Fig. 4) . The average Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) ranged from 0.84 to 0.71 for nsp8 and 0.78 to 0.53 for nsp12. There was a small decrease in PCCs for both nsp8 and nsp12 at later time points; however, the PCCs remained above 0.5 throughout infection, which is considered strong colocalization. This colocalization was present in both syncytia and individual infected cells (Fig. 4A and B) . These data demonstrated that nsp15 strongly colocalized with two proteins associated with the CoV RTC by confocal microscopy. nsp15 does not localize to sites of assembly. These results demonstrated strong colocalization of nsp15 with RTCs but did not address whether nsp15 also localized to sites of virus assembly. To this end, we costained rA59 WT -infected cells with anti-nsp15 and anti-M protein antibodies. M protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and is a marker for sites of assembly (40) . To more formally confirm a lack of colocalization, we used rabbit anti-nsp15 to enable the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to M protein. M protein displayed tight punctate staining, most likely in the ERGIC compartment, at 6 and 8 hpi (Fig. 5B , top and middle). At 12 hpi, most cells were syncytial, and M puncta were scattered throughout the cytoplasm and potentially the cell membrane, most likely due to Golgi fragmentation (Fig. 5B, bottom) (41) . At all stages of infection, nsp15 did not colocalize with M protein (Fig. 5B) , resulting in low PCCs of \u03fd0.3 throughout infection (Fig. 5C ). Similar results were obtained when cells were infected with rA59 Nsp15-HA in lieu of rA59 WT (data not shown). These results indicated that nsp15 was not localized to sites of assembly during infection.",

Further, it was previously shown that nsp15 localized with replicating RNA (10), but its localization and interactions with other viral proteins were previously unknown. In this work, utilizing our in situ HA tag, we found strong colocalization of nsp15 with nsp8 and nsp12 throughout infection (Fig. 4) . Further, we found only low levels of staining outside the RTC and no colocalization with M protein (Fig. 5) . These data indicate that nsp15 localized to replication compartments with little or no detectable localization to other cellular or viral compartments. We found that nsp15 interacted with two markers of the RTC, nsp8 and nsp12, both with and without nuclease treatment, indicating that these interactions occur without the involvement of an RNA intermediate (Fig. 6 ). Our methods cannot distinguish direct from indirect interactions, so it remains possible that a viral or host protein mediates these binding events. While these interactions were detected in MHV-infected cells, a previous yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen along with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown identified potential binding partners of SARS-CoV nsp15, including nsp8 and nsp12 (15) , suggesting these interactions are conserved among CoVs. These data collectively suggest that nsp15 is required for optimal viral production.

Previous data have demonstrated a link between nsp15's oligomeric state and RNA binding and cleavage (24) (25) (26) .

            "text": "In the present study, both the sequence and structure of the P/S stem were altered by our in situ tag. While viral replication was unaffected, viral fitness was modestly decreased compared to wild-type virus (Fig. 3B ). This decrease in viral fitness was most likely due to a significant decrease in selective gRNA packaging in rA59 Nsp15-HA , as a similar phenotype was described with a P/S deletion virus (36) . In rA59 Nsp15-HA , we found a significant \u03fe25-fold (Fig. 3A) increase in sgRNA packaging. This decrease in selective packaging may reflect requirements for the primary sequence of the P/S stem, proper secondary structure, or a combination of both, but at this point, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities. It has been hypothesized that internal conserved secondary structures, e.g., 2-bp bulges, play a functional role in selective packaging (38) . From our data, we hypothesize that the pentaloop and the remaining 2-bp bulge are not sufficient for efficient selective packaging. However, it remains possible that they are necessary for some degree of selective packaging, perhaps mediating interactions with M protein (34) . This may explain why the HA tag sequence was stable, whereas the FLAG tag sequence was quickly lost following passaging of the virus ( Fig. 3B ; data not shown). Further work is required to determine what factors within the P/S are important for selective packaging of genomic RNA.",

To create the in situ tag, we first identified a site with favorable characteristics for the insertion of a tag. These characteristics include (i) lack of conservation in other \u2424-CoVs, suggesting that the site would tolerate mutation, (ii) being nonessential for replication, and (iii) surface exposure. The MHV P/S located within nsp15 met all of these criteria. We found that our rA59 Nsp15-HA in situ tag had little to no effect on viral RNA transcription/replication, viral protein expression, or virus production (Fig. 2) . Using criteria similar to those presented here, we believe other CoV proteins could be internally tagged and studied during infection from native expression. The creation of internal tags and use of their corresponding monoclonal antibody (MAb) open new applications for the study of CoV replication, most notably the identification of novel in vivo RTC interactions.",
