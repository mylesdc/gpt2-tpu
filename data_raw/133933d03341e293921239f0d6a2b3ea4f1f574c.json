These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.",

Many disease states are difficult to diagnose due to the lack of specific and well-characterized biomarkers in an accessible specimen. These generalizations apply in particular to infectious disease diagnostics. The clinical signs of infection are often nonspecific (e.g., inflammation or fever) and may originate from many possible sources, yet the treatments are more often specific and require an accurate diagnosis to be effective. There are many infectious diseases endemic in LRS where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to effective treatment, in part because of co-morbidities that confound a differential diagnosis. These diseases include malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), tuberculosis (TB), influenza, and many others. [1] Millions of lives are lost and a huge morbidity burden incurred through inadequate diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. [1] In many cases the need for rapid diagnostics appropriate for these LRS is so severe that mediocre performance tests such as RDT are preferred to less accessible but better performing NA tests. [2] Clearly, any technology that can increase the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS could have a significant impact on global public health.",

Like many molecular diagnostic assays, nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) typically require a significant investment in equipment, training, and infrastructure. Economic and infrastructural realities dictate that diagnostics for the developing world need to be foremost inexpensive; but also, accurate, reliable, rugged, and suited to the contexts of these lowresource settings (LRS). [3] [4] [5] Recent guidelines published by the World Health Organization recommend that diagnostic devices for developing countries should be ASSURED: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipmentfree, and Deliverable to end users. [6] In some diagnostic contexts in LRS, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) based on the immunochromatography strip (ICS) fit the ASSURED model, albeit with limited sensitivity and specificity. [7] [8] [9] NAAT assays that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification are capable of providing excellent sensitivity and specificity but generally fail to meet the ASSURED guidelines for affordability, rapidity and robustness, equipment-free operation, and deliverability. [10, 11] Appropriate, low-cost, equipment-free, pathogen-specific NA marker assays that characterize medical care in much of the developing world remain unavailable in LRS.",

PCR is inherently impractical in LRS where reliable electrical power, complex equipment, training, reagent storage, quality programs and clean water, are intermittent or absent. [1, 12] Recently, there have been significant developments in a class of NAATs that do not require temperature cycling. [13] [14] [15] [16] A comprehensive review of these techniques, and their application in LRS has recently been published. [17] These isothermal amplification techniques vary in amplification temperature and duration, as well as complexity of reagents required-and many are proprietary-but all have the potential to be simpler and require less complex equipment than PCR-based assays. These methods use a variety of reaction principles to specifically amplify NA targets through isothermal melting, exponential amplification and intermediate target generation; and which, in several cases, can be detected directly without the need for an instrument. [17] [18] [19] [20] Nevertheless, almost all investigators and manufacturers currently use some type of electrically powered equipment to achieve and maintain the temperature required for amplification, although this equipment can be much simpler than the typical PCR thermocycler. This inherent simplicity makes isothermal amplification more appropriate for diagnostics in LRS.",

We are currently developing a non-instrumented nucleic acid (NINA) platform that requires no detection instrument, no electrical power, no batteries, and no external reagents. We believe this can be achieved by combining isothermal amplification with a novel method for generating the required temperature profile without electrical power in a simple disposable that contains the lyophilized assay reagents. Our first prototype of this platform uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) [21] as the model for an isothermal amplification technique and malaria as a model diagnostic target. The amplification protocol requires incubating the reaction mixture at ,65uC for at least 60 minutes. This temperature requirement is sufficiently flexible that small excursions (+/21.5uC) around this target are tolerable. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] LAMP (and several other isothermal techniques) have been shown to far less sensitive to inhibitors than PCR, to the point where direct assay of whole blood and other unpurified specimens is feasible. [18, 19] In those cases, no power or instruments are required for NA purification, as is the case with PCR. In addition, recent advances in protein stabilization make it likely that the reagents can be dried-down in the reaction tubes with sufficient stability to avoid the need for a cold-chain during delivery and storage. Thus, another power consuming ''instrument'' is eliminated. We have not yet attempted to package all of these features and advances into a single prototype device; however, the successful demonstration of electricity-free temperature-controlled heating in a disposable format reported here is an important first step toward the long-term goal.",

Table S1summarizes the prior history of prototype development. Hatano and coworkers recently described a crude heater that was able to perform a qualitative LAMP assay for anthrax using off-the shelf pocket hand warmers and a Styrofoam box. [27] Dominguez et al. used a similar container with an unspecified phase change material to maintain a stable incubation temperature for a commercial interferon gamma release assay at 37C (although the heat source was conventional). [28] While these interesting approaches are compelling in their simplicity, the bulky apparatus displayed slow warm-up (.30 min.); and for LAMP, significant temperature variation within incubation time, and a lack of run-to-run repeatability was observed. To meet the performance goals implied in the ASSURED guidelines, an optimized heating unit should be engineered to eliminate or minimize all sources of variation. When combined with the temperature-moderating characteristics of engineered phase change materials (EPCM), we demonstrate that an engineered exothermal chemical heating unit can produce a consistent constant-temperature incubator for isothermal NA amplification suitable for a variety of isothermal techniques.",

The CaO temperature traces show rapid and poorly controlled heat generation, with maximum temperatures exceeding 100uC. The traces of the EPCM at the interface with the CaO have a pattern similar to the CaO, but the initial temperature excursions are reduced in magnitude, and the plots are far more repeatable.

Thus, the temperature in the EPCM remains constant at the selected melting temperature until the solid to liquid transition is complete (provided heat transfer within the EPCM is rapid).

It is unclear at this time how this behavior contributes to variation seen in the results of the LAMP assay; however, the manufacturer of the EPCM is confident that further development of the EPCM for this application will mitigate this behavior. The EPCM is a fully hydrogenated fat product, so it is resistant to environmental oxidation and should be very stable. While the EPCM is not currently as readily available as CaO, and is not a commodity product like CaO, similar materials have been used in consumer products in the US.

CaO disposables are single use, while dry cells are expected to last five runs based on their energy density (four D-cells would be required). Two grades of CaO (reagent grade and soap grade), with an EPCM are compared to three possible dry-cell implementations (with an EPCM, with microprocessor closedloop control, with thermostat closed-loop control). With a projected cost per run of US$0.56, the soap-grade CaO/EPCM combination is clearly the least-expensive alternative (compared to $1.40, $1.17, $1.21, and $1.16 for reagent-grade CaO/EPCM, Dcell/EPCM, D-cell/microprocessor, and D-cell/thermostat, respectively.)

A CaO heater with a different EPCM formulation has been shown to yield a temperature profile suitable for EXPAR with a nominal temperature of 55uC ( Figure 4A ). Evaluation with EXPAR reactions are in process. We have also explored a similar heater approach with sodium acetate (NaAc, Figure 4B ). Hand warmers based on the crystallization reaction of NaAc are common. In a purified form, at typical ambient temperatures, liquid NaAc is thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable due to the absence of nucleating sites for crystal formation. The application of a mechanical shock initiates the exothermic crystallization, and when mixed as a 25% aqueous solution the phase change occurs repeatably at ,37uC. In this system, NaAc acts as both the exothermic reactant and the EPCM. This system has the advantage of being regenerable (immersion of the NaAc in boiling water is sufficient). For isothermal amplification methods operating at temperatures below 45uC as well as for other diagnostic applications requiring heating (e.g., smart-polymer-based analyte pre-concentration [30] ), NaAc is the preferred exothermic/ phase change system.

As operated here, LAMP is an exponential rate assay being assessed with an endpoint measurement. Thus, the timing of reaction interrogation and/or a reliable ''stop'' reaction are required for quantitative precision. If quantitative results are required, improvements to the entire assay system to facilitate precise timing will be necessary. This could include, for example, a different heater-lid or incubation-vessels to facilitate access, or a ''reading window'' in the heater to enable visual interrogation while the vessel is still in the heater. An elevated temperature ''stop'' (.80uC) is generally used for LAMP. In our experimental work here, we used an electrical heat block for this purpose; however, this could be accomplished with the electricity-free heater by the inclusion of a parallel heating unit at a higher temperature (essentially, by including a second incubation chamber that uses a different EPCM, or no EPCM at all). Alternatively, a chemical ''stop'' could be developed, or a boiling water bath could be kept at hand. Other assays perform best with a pre-amplification, high-temperature denaturation step (''hot start''). A second incubator chamber could facilitate this feature even more readily.",

[28] Alternatively, the amplified product could be the input to a lateral flow strip test with a visual readout. [36] [37] [38] [39] Any of these potential improvements should be approached with a secondary aim of minimizing the potential for amplicon contamination from previous tests. Wherever possible, opening of the amplicon container after amplification should be avoided. This may be challenging if molecular beacon quenchers need to be added, or aliquots for ICS testing need to be removed.

            "text": "There are several applications of this technology that could have an impact on diagnostics for LRS. One application is as a modular amplification unit where a sample and the required reagents would be introduced to the heater and amplified product withdrawn for subsequent analysis by any simple detector. In this embodiment a standard PCR tube can be the reaction chamber and could be used later as a cuvette for fluorometric analysis to resolve the presence of amplicons. This would free the user from the high power requirements of electrical heating but would still require some sort of detection instrument or device with its attendant requirements. One could also imagine how a properly tuned, stand-alone heater unit could be applicable to any field analytical or preparative method that requires a constant heat source; e.g., cell lysis or temperature-responsive polymer mediated concentration. More compelling is the potential of the NINA heater as the core component of a stand-alone assay kit, capable of providing a result without external electrical power, a reader instrument, or any complex ancillaries. Such a device might include the NINA heater, reaction chambers containing lyophilized reagents, sample metering devices, a readout chamber or lateral flow strip for visible interrogation, and an LED ''penlight'' for fluorescence excitation (if required). We envisage versions of the kit that are fully disposable (for high-value applications in developed countries such as for home testing and for first-responder biothreat detection) and partially reusable (primarily for LRS use). Most of the components necessary to create such a NINA kit already exist. We are currently working to combine them into a field-ready, instrument-and electricity-free, sample-toresult, molecular diagnostic test system ( Figure S1 ).",

To keep the isothermal device within the temperature band required for LAMP, the reaction chambers were surrounded with an engineered fat-based compound with a high specific heat capacity and specific melting range centered around 65uC (Renewable Alternatives, Inc., Columbia, MO, USA). While several prototype heater designs have been explored, the optimized heater uses an off-the-shelf insulated food storage container (a ''thermos'') to provide an insulated housing with two chambers ( Figure 5 ). The bottom chamber contains the exothermic reaction, and the upper chamber contains the EPCM and reaction wells. To facilitate directed heat transfer to the reaction wells, an aluminum ''honeycomb'' material (Plascore, Inc., Zeeland, MI, USA) was added to the upper chamber prior to introduction of the EPCM. The machined reaction wells, sized to closely fit a standard 200-mL PCR tube, are embedded in the EPCM. Three reaction wells were used for most prototypes (one for a positive control, one for a negative control, and one for an unknown specimen); however, the existing prototype could easily be modified to accept several times this number without significant loss of performance, based on the available space in the EPCM and first principles of heat transfer. An inexpensive spring timer (manufacturer's suggested retail price [MSRP] <10 US$) with an audible ''ready'' indicator was affixed to the lid of the heater unit for added electricity-free functionality.",

These observations conform to those noted by the operator at the actual time of the analysis, so no artifacts have been introduced by the photographic process. A quantitative comparison of Calcein fluorescence corroborates the qualitative study. A statistical method comparison by the two most common techniques indicates substantial quantitative agreement between samples incubated in the NINA heater to those incubated in parallel in the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner. Linear regression of the fluorescence intensity units (FIU) observed for samples incubated in the NINA heater as a dependant variable of the FIU observed for samples incubated in the ESE-Quant (Figure 3A) results in a slope of 0.98 and a y-intercept of 37.5 FIU, with a coefficient of determination of 0.87.
