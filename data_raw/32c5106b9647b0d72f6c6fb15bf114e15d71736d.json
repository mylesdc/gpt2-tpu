In this study, we report the emergence, mixed infection, and genetic characterization of 15 novel field PEDV variants with large genomic deletions. The sizes of deletion varied between 582 nt (194 aa) and 648 nt (216 aa) at positions 28-714 (10-238) on the S gene (protein). Among 17 PEDV samples isolated from individual pigs, all of them contained at least two distinct genotypes with large genomic deletions, and 94.1% of them were found to consist of strains with an intact S gene. These variants were found in eight primary and nine recurrent outbreaks, and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in the farms. Full-length S and ORF3 genes of eight variants derived from 2 samples were characterized. This is the first report of mixed infections caused by various genotypes of PEDV and would be important for the studies of viral isolation, pathogenesis, and molecular epidemiology of the disease.",

            "text": "Amplification of the partial S gene, full-length S gene, and ORF3 gene Reverse transcription was performed using random primers and oligo-dT primers from Reverse Transcription System Kits (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To determine the complete S gene sequence, five primer sets (CS1-CS5, Table 1 ) were used to amplify five DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene. These primers were designed on the basis of the published sequences of reference PEDV strains [5, 9, 33] . EmeraldAmp MAX PCR Master Mix kit (Takara Bio, Japan) containing high fidelity DNA polymerases was used for performing the PCR amplifications under the following conditions: denaturation at 94\u02daC for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u02daC for 30 s, annealing at 54\u02daC for 30 s and extension at 72\u02daC for 1 min; a final extension step at 72\u02daC for 10 min. When a partial S gene was amplified using the primer pair CS1-F/CS1-R from generated cDNA, one or two distinct bands of unexpected shorter sizes were observed in each PCR product in addition to the predicted band (Fig 1) . The same result was observed when one-step RT-PCR tests (AccessQuick RT-PCR System kit, Promega Corp, WI, USA) were performed from extracted RNA and PCR tests using other kits containing high fidelity DNA polymerases (KOD FX, KOD FX neo, and Blend-Tag Plus Kits, Toyobo Co., Japan) were performed from cDNA templates to amplify the CS1 fragment. The unexpected and expected DNA bands were also observed and distinguished upon performing PCR amplifications with longer fragments containing the first portion of the S gene (primer pairs CS1-F/CS2-R, CS1-F/CS3-R, and CS1-F/CS4-R). The PCR products containing the CS1 fragment were individually gel-extracted and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vectors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). The cloning reaction was then chemically transformed into One Shot TOP10 To obtain the sequence of the full-length S gene and ORF3 gene of PEDV strains coexisting in a single PEDV sample, a fragment containing these two contiguous genes was amplified using the primer set FS-F/ORF3-R and the EmeraldAmp MAX PCR Master Mix kit (Takara Bio, Japan). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94\u02daC for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u02daC for 30 s, annealing at 55\u02daC for 30 s and extension at 72\u02daC for 5 min; a final extension step at 72\u02daC for 10 min. The expected size of this amplified product was 4955 bp. Subsequently, the PCR products were gel-extracted and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO plasmid vectors (TOPO XL PCR Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, US). After transformation into competent cells, plasmid DNA isolation was performed as described previously. The purified plasmid DNA was sequenced using the primer sets CS1-CS5 and the primer set ORF3-F/ORF3-R [15] . However, when the fragment containing entire S and ORF3 genes was amplified, PCR products derived from only two samples JKa-295 and JMi-277 were visualized distinctly in agarose gel 0.8%. Therefore, these two samples were selected for cloning and sequencing of the fulllength S and ORF3 genes.",

Furthermore, the genotype with a 203-aa deletion at residues 10-217 featured a 5-aa insertion (YAMFF) at the position of the deletion. Interestingly, the identical nucleotide sequence corresponding to the insertion (TACGCCATGTTCTTT) existed in the middle of the S gene (nt 2091-2105).

Within JKa-295, three variants with the 197-aa deletion shared 99.72-99.92% nucleotide sequence identity with each other but had 99.38-99.55% nucleotide sequence identity with JKa-295fSde204Co25, which possessed the 204-aa deletion (S1 Table) . On the contrary, all strains found in JKa-295 and JMi-277 had the greatest [39] . Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length S gene classified these Japanese strains into the North American (highly virulent) type as shown in Fig 2A. It is suggested that the variants originated from North American type of PEDV. The sequencing results illustrated that the ORF3 gene of the 11 strains in JKa-295 and JMi-277 had the same length of 675 nt, and it did not possess any deletion found in known PEDV vaccine strains [15, 27, 40] . All of the variants with large deletions have the same ORF3 nucleotide sequence excluding JKa-295fSde194Co25. Nucleotide identity of the ORF3 gene between the variants and intact S strains was 98.81-99.41% which was lower than the 28 field isolates (99.6-100%) collected from 5 prefectures in Japan during 2103-2104 [15] . Eight distinct SNPs between the variants and the strains with an intact S gene were also identified at positions 136, 154, 178, 228, 302, 561, 645, and 657 in the ORF3 gene (S2 Fig) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strains with an intact S gene and the variants fell into two distinct clades (Fig 2B) . The result indicated that the variants were not vaccine-related, and might have evolved independently as compared to the intact S strains which coexisted in the individual samples.",

In four farms (Te, Sa, Is, and At), the variants were not found in the primary outbreaks, but they appeared in subsequent pandemics. This indicated that PEDV variants could be transmitted from farm to farm and/or that the proportion of the variants in samples collected at the primary outbreaks was insufficient to permit detection of the variants by PCR. Additionally, PED outbreaks in Japan since late 2013 were proposed to be caused by the invasion of recent overseas strains [15, 31] . Taken together, it is possible that in the recent pandemic, both the PEDV variants and the strains with an intact S gene were introduced together from other countries, after which they spread across Japan. However, the earliest PED outbreak of the variants possessing the large S deletions occurred on Kagoshima on December 2013 (sample JKa-292) while the first PED case in Japan was reported earlier in Okinawa on October 2013. Presently, no PEDVs possessing the large deletions in the N-terminus of the S gene analogous to the Japanese variants was reported in other countries except PC177-P2 which was concluded to derive from cell adaptation in vitro. Therefore, the variants might have arisen spontaneously during the PEDV spreading in Japan. Further studies are required for the confirmation.",

In JAo-56, we could not identify any PEDV strain with an intact S gene. In the farm from which this sample was collected, the sows had never been vaccinated with modified live PEDV. Piglets in the farm manifested various severities of diarrhea from mild to severe, and the mortality rate reached 72.4% (670/926). The mortality rate was much higher than the mortality rate recorded in the epidemic during which Tottori2 was isolated (0%) [19] . Therefore, the large deletion in the variants observed in this study might not necessarily lower the virulence of this virus. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the virulence of variants in PED outbreaks.",

Among the few recurrent PED outbreaks reported in 2014 and 2015, all the samples collected from pig farms in Miyazaki (6 farms) and Aichi (2 farms) were found to contain the PEDV variants. In those farms, diarrhea in piglets was observed for a long time (up to three months), and outbreaks of PED were reported to frequently recur in intervals from three weeks to several months (S2 Table) . Although many strict measures for establishing a high level of security were implemented such as quarantine of reposition, strict visitor policies, banning of unwashed vehicles, controlling of carcasses, movement of the caretakers on the farms and using virucidal disinfectants; PED still recurred in the farms. Therefore, it is suggested that mixed infection of PEDV variants with large genomic deletions may play an important role in the persistence of PEDV in pig farms.",

DI particles are defective for replication in the absence of the product of the deleted gene, and its replication requires the presence of the complete functional virus particle to co-infect a cell with it, in order to provide the lost factors [42] . The PEDV variants wherein large genomic deletions were observed may be DI particles. However, we speculated otherwise because the reported PEDV strains PC177-P2 and Tottori2 possessing the same deletions found in the variants of this study could replicate well in cell culture and cause cytopathic effect [17, 19] . Besides, the mutant strain PC177-P2 can propagate well and induce diarrhea in piglets [43] . A deletion of 215 aa (position in the N-terminal domain of the S protein analogous to the deletion observed in the variants revealed a not impaired propagation of PEDV in vivo [44] . Moreover, only variants with large S deletions were found in the field sample JAo-56, which indicated that the variants were able to independently propagate well in pigs. Additionally, all the deletions found in the variants are in-frame and the S proteins were predicted to express as a functional structure protein.

            "text": "Functions of the spike protein N-terminal domain of PEDV and other alphacoronaviruses were previously elucidated [44] . The loss of this domain occurred in a number of alphacoronaviruses correlates with a loss or reduction of enteric tropism. The most obvious example of this phenomenon is transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) that has a dual tropism targeting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of the pig. Meanwhile, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a natural variant of TGEV which lacks the S protein N-domain. It has reduced considerably its enteric tropism and primarily replicated in the respiratory tract then, produced an attenuated disease in comparison with parental TGEV strains. Another typical example is feline coronaviruses that have 2 pathotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causing a clinical mild or asymptomatic disease and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) inducing a highly pathologic disease. FIPV is thought to be derived from FECV by natural mutation. However, compared to FECV, PIPV has a large deletion in the S protein N-domain which results in the loss of tropism for enterocytes [44, 45] . These examples revealed an important role of alphacoronavirus spike N-domain for viral replication in the enteric tract. The N-terminus (residues 1-249) of the S protein was demonstrated to be responsible for the sialic acid binding activity of PEDV [44] . The loss of enteric tropism observed in TGEV was specifically associated with the loss of the sialic binding activity that located in the N-domain. However, how the sialic acid binding activity affects the tropism of these alphacoronaviruses remains unclear. The S protein N-domain of some PEDV strains were thought to be dispensable for replication of PEDV in vitro [44] [45] [46] . The large deletions in the S protein of the PEDV variants in this study indicated that this domain might also be dispensable in vivo. In the present study, the characteristics of large deletions found in the Japanese variants were highly similar to those observed in the PRCV that have a 224 or 227-aa deletion in the N-terminal domain of the S protein [47] . PRCV can persist in pig herds throughout the entire year, or it can disappear temporarily from a herd for several months and reappear subsequently. The emergence and widespread prevalence of PRCV lessened the clinical impact of TGE in the United States and Europe due to cross-protective immunity with TGEV [48] . Thus, the PEDV variants identified in this study might have biological characteristics analogous to PRCV and may persist in the pig farms of Japan. Unfortunately, we did not collect lung tissues from PEDV-infected pigs in these outbreaks, and virus isolation for the individual variants has not yet been completed. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the PEDV variants found in this study exhibited altered virulence, pathogenicity, and tissue tropism from the strains with an intact S gene. In future studies, we will continuously seek to answer this question.",

Our study identified 15 field PEDV genotypes with large deletions in the S gene that have been circulating in Japan from 2013 to 2015. The full-length S gene and ORF3 gene of eight variants and three strains with an intact S gene were characterized. The variants coexisted with intact S strains in high frequency and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in pig farms in Japan. Such a reemerging and mixed infection of the variants in this study have put PED in a new situation indicating this disease has become more complex in terms of viral isolation, pathogenesis, and epidemiology. The mechanism by which the PEDV variants were generated and evolved remains unclear. Hence, further studies are required to elucidate biological properties such as changes in tissue tropism and the virulence patterns of the new variants. Table.
