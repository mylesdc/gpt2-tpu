A number of VZV genes remain functionally uncharacterized and since VZV is an obligate human pathogen, rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants in vivo remains challenging. Simian varicella virus (SVV) is homologous to VZV and SVV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely mimics VZV infection of humans. Recently the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type (WT) SVV in vitro. Methods: RMs were infected with BAC-derived SVV or WT SVV at 4x10 5 PFU intrabronchially (N=8, 4 per group, sex and age matched). We collected whole blood (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at various days postinfection (dpi) and sensory ganglia during latent infection (>84 dpi) at necropsy and compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response and the establishment of latency.",

Currently the FDA vaccine Zostavax\u00ae reduces the incidence of shingles by 51% and the burden of disease by approximately 61% [1, 2] . Thus, a significant portion of vaccine recipients still remains susceptible to VZV reactivation.

SVV shares significant DNA homology and genome colinearity with VZV [6] [7] [8] [9] . VZV and SVV have the smallest genomes of the herpesvirus family. VZV encodes at least 70 unique ORFs and SVV encodes 69 distinct ORFs [8, 10] . Despite the smaller genome size and homology to herpes simplex virus (HSV), a number of VZV/SVV genes remain functionally uncharacterized. Studies characterizing viral gene function utilizing in vitro tissue culture models do not always model the complex host-pathogen relationship that occurs in vivo. Recently, with the construction of an infectious SVV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), the production of mutations and deletions in specific SVV ORFs will allow the investigation of gene function during in vivo infection [11] . Previously, SVV BAC was shown to generate infectious virus with molecular properties and in vitro replication kinetics comparable to wild-type (WT) SVV [11] . SVV BAC was also used to generate an ORF10 deletion virus, which demonstrated that SVV ORF10 is nonessential for replication in vitro [11] . In the current study we further investigate SVV BAC in vivo by monitoring replication kinetics, immune response and establishment of latency in rhesus macaques and show that SVV BAC is as pathogenic as WT SVV.",

Using this technique, any differences in genomic sequence between SVV BAC and WT SVV results in variations in hybridization intensities to corresponding segments represented on the array, giving an altered hybridization ratio between SVV BAC and WT SVV ( Figure 1A ). CGH analysis revealed that two areas displayed variations when compared to WT SVV, indicating differences in nucleotide sequence at these locations. These regions were amplified via PCR and directly sequenced resulting in the identification of two nucleotide substitutions that produced 1 missense mutation and 1 silent mutation within the coding region of the SVV BAC genome. Specifically, we identified a point mutation at nucleotide 41990 from G to A within ORF22, producing an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine ( Figure 1B ) and a transition of nucleotide 106546 from T to C producing a silent mutation within ORF62/71 ( Figure 1C ). The nucleotide change in ORF62/71 was also previously shown in the sequencing of an ORF61 deletion virus that was generated from the same parental SVV cosmid system [11] [12] [13] . SVV ORF22 is a putative tegument protein based on the function of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) UL36 homolog. The missense mutation in ORF22 did not render SVV BAC derived virus noninfectious or hamper replication kinetics and plaque size in vitro [11] .",

In BAL cells and PBMC we measured similar proliferation of both subsets of B cells and no statistical differences in RMs infected with either SVV BAC or WT SVV except for at 10 dpi in BAL cells of WT SVV infected RMs we detected higher proliferation of MZ-like B cells (p<0.05) compared to SVV BAC. We also measured SVV-specific IgG ( Figure 4C ) antibody endpoint titers in plasma using standard ELISA. The kinetics of IgG production were comparable during SVV BAC and WT SVV infection of RMs, the titers peaked around day 14 post-infection and remained stable until necropsy. BAC or WT SVV infected RMs, SVV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected 7 dpi, their frequency peaked between 14 and 21 dpi and declined to a memory set point. There were no statistically significant differences between animals infected with SVV BAC or WT SVV, and both cohorts did not produce a measurable CD4 or CD8 response in PBMCs following stimulation with overlapping viral peptide pools (data not shown).",

BACs were constructed for the VZV parental Oka virus and the vaccine Oka virus [35] [36] [37] [38] . All VZV ORFs have been deleted using BACs or cosmids and tested in cell culture providing valuable information on which VZV genes are essential for viral replication in vitro (reviewed in [39, 40] ). Subsequent in vivo analysis of VZV mutant viruses using the SCID-hu mouse model showed that VZV ORFs 1, 2, and 3 are dispensable for viral replication [38] , whereas VZV ORF23, which was dispensable for replication in culture, was found to be required for replication in human skin xenografts [41] . Similarly, VZV deleted for ORF7 replicated in MeWo cells but in vivo ORF7 was shown to be important for neuroinvasion [40, 42] . Lastly, mutating the furin recognition site of VZV ORF31 (gB), an essential viral protein, did not affect VZV replication in vitro but attenuated viral replication in vivo [43] . Studying VZV mutant viruses in the SCID-hu mouse model has provided valuable insight into VZV biology, further evaluation of the role of different VZV ORFs in pathogenesis and the immune response in vivo is hampered by the fact that VZV is an obligate human pathogen. SVV is a simian homolog of VZV that causes varicella and zoster in nonhuman primates [4] [5] [6] .",

CGH analysis was employed as a cost-effective and accurate strategy to analyze genomic DNA from multiple viruses. This technique is sensitive enough to detect single base changes in addition to insertions, deletion or rearrangements in the genome [45] [46] [47] . We sequenced two sites in the SVV BAC genome that displayed variations in hybridization when compared to WT SVV. In ORF22 a point mutation at nucleotide 41990 was found producing an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine. SVV and VZV ORF22 are putative tegument proteins based on homology to HSV-1 UL36 [48] . UL36 is a HSV-1 late gene and the HSV-1 virion contains 100-150 copies of UL36 [49, 50] . UL36 is essential to HSV-1 replication and the phenotype of a null mutant virus showed accumulation of capsids containing cytosolic DNA that did not mature into enveloped virions [51] [52] [53] . Though, the evidence suggests that the amino acid change in SVV BAC does not constitute a significant change in the protein. In vitro SVV BAC displays similar plaque size and replication kinetics in Vero cell monolayers as compared to WT SVV [11] . Our data in vivo shows that SVV BAC displays similar replication kinetics, immune response and establishment of latency compared to WT SVV. Potentially the position of the amino acid change or that the change is a nonpolar side chain to a nonpolar side change allows for WT behavior.",

Peak levels of IFN\u03b1, an important antiviral cytokine, occurred at 3 dpi, which corresponds to peak viral loads in the lungs also at 3 dpi. Type I interferons are early immune effectors and are important cytokines during initial infection to limit viral replication and spread, including herpesviruses [54] [55] [56] . The concentrations of several T cell-recruiting chemokines (MCP-1, MIG, I-TAC) peaked 7 days prior to the observed peak in proliferating T cells in BAL samples. We also detected increased concentrations of TNF\u03b1 (3 dpi) and IFN\u03b3 (7 dpi), which is indicative of Th1 immune responses and correlates with an increase in CD4 CM in BAL samples. Peak concentrations of IL-2 were detected 7 days prior (7 dpi) to the peak proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells (14 dpi). Levels of IL-12, which play a role in enhancing cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells, peaked 4 days before peak proliferation of CD8 T cells in BAL samples. Interestingly, we also detected an increase in growth factors in the BAL fluid, which peaked from 7 to 10 days postinfection. Many of these growth factors are involved in wound healing and might represent a response to tissue injury induced by SVV replication within the lungs (site of inoculation).",
