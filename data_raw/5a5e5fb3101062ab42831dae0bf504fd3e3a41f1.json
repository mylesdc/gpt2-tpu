The region of the antigen bound to the antibodies is called epitope. Experimental data indicate that many antibodies react with a panel of distinct epitopes (positive reaction). The Challenge 1 of DREAM5 aims at understanding whether there exists rules for predicting the reactivity of a peptide/epitope, i.e., its capability to bind to human antibodies. DREAM 5 provided a training set of peptides with experimentally identified high and low reactivities to human antibodies. On the basis of this training set, the participants to the challenge were asked to develop a predictive model of reactivity. A test set was then provided to evaluate the performance of the model implemented so far. We developed a logistic regression model to predict the peptide reactivity, by facing the challenge as a machine learning problem. The initial features have been generated on the basis of the available knowledge and the information reported in the dataset. Our predictive model had the second best performance of the challenge. We also developed a method, based on a clustering approach, able to ''in-silico'' generate a list of positive and negative new peptide sequences, as requested by the DREAM5 ''bonus round'' additional challenge. The paper describes the developed model and its results in terms of reactivity prediction, and highlights some open issues concerning the propensity of a peptide to react with human antibodies.",

Machine learning methods have been frequently coupled with the so-called scale-based approach; this approach exploits one or more scales of amino acid properties to weight each residues of the sequence of interest.

In particular, the estimated coefficients of both models are reported in Table 2 , columns 4 and 5. These coefficients have been evaluated on the basis of the available knowledge but also on the basis of the correlation of each feature with the class, as computed in the training set (Single Regression Coefficients -SRCs). The second column of Table 2 reports the regression coefficient computed for each attribute, while column 3 reports its F-measure. N Every SRC corresponding to an alignment-based feature has the expected sign, given its definition: SRCs are negative for MaxScore_0 and DiffMaxScore features, while they are positive for MaxScore_1. This is confirmed by the corresponding values of the regression coefficients for model B (see Table 2 at column 4). However, model C has an unexpected negative value related to MaxScore_1_nw (see Table 2 at column 5)., Both models confirm that local alignment is more useful for classification than global alignment. Based on all these considerations, we selected model B as the best final model, even if model C had a higher F-measure.",

This result confirms the appropriateness of the scale used for its calculation [9] : this is defined as the ratio between the frequency of the residue in antigenic determinants (experimentally identified) and the frequency of the amino acid on the surface (predicted by using the average of hydrophilicity, accessibility and flexibility values reported by Parker et al.

All the other scale-based features have negative SRCs; as a matter of fact, it is known that accessibility, hydrophilicity and flexibility have negative correlations with the reactivity, while it is more difficult to interpret the negative correlation of beta-turn propensity. Both model B and C include only three scale-based features. Given the SRCs and their plausible explanations, both models have only an unexpected regression coefficient, in correspondence of flexibility (model B) and antigenicity (model C). N No well-defined knowledge is available about the influence of the amino acid frequencies on the peptide reactivity. So, we assessed the correlation of the corresponding SRCs with the different amino acid scales (antigenicity: 0.29; accessibility: 20.66; hydrophilicity: 20.69; flexibility: 20.52; beta-turn propensity: 20.19). The sign of the correlations (i.e. Spearman correlation) follows the same pattern of the scale-based features: all the features are negatively correlated with peptide reactivity except for antigenicity. Finally, we evaluated the reliability of the regression coefficients of the multivariate model in terms of their correlation with the SRCs. Model B showed a good positive correlation between the regression coefficients and the correspondent SRCs (i.e. Spearman correlation = 0.496 and p-value = 0.028), while in model C no correlation was found (i.e. Spearman correlation = 20.075 and p-value = 0.753).",
