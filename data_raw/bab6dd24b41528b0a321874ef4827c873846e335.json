            "text": "Background and objectives: In addition to conventional healthcare, Ebola survivors are known to seek traditional and complementary healthcare (T&CM) options to meet their healthcare needs. However, little is known about the general beliefs of Ebola survivors regarding T&CM and the impact of these beliefs in influencing their decisions around T&CM use. This study examines Ebola survivors' attitudes towards T&CM use in Sierra Leone. Materials and Methods: We conducted a nationwide quantitative cross-sectional study of 358 Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone between January and August 2018. We used descriptive analysis, chi-square tests and backward stepwise binary logistic regression for data analysis. Results: Close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T&CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Survivors who viewed T&CM as boosting their immune system/resistance were 3.89 times (95%CI: 1.57-9.63, p = 0.003) more likely to use T&CM than those who did not view T&CM as boosting their immune system/resistance. Additionally, survivors who viewed T&CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine were more likely to use T&CM [OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92-13.19, p = 0.001)]. Ebola survivors were more influenced to use T&CM based on their personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM than by clinical evidence [OR = 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10-30.84, P < 0.001)]. Ebola survivors who perceived T&CM as providing them with more control than conventional medicine over their health/body were more likely to use T&CM , p = 0.001)] as opposed to those who did not perceive T&CM in this way. Conclusions: Considering the widespread use of T&CM, an understanding of Ebola survivors' attitudes/beliefs towards T&CM is useful to healthcare providers and policymakers with regard to public education and practitioner-survivors communication, T&CM regulation and research in Sierra Leone. Ebola survivors appear to turn to T&CM not only for treatment, but also to fill gaps in conventional health care services.",

In Africa, T&CM may include traditional healthcare products and practices (herbal medicine or products and traditional bone setting) and imported complementary medicine (acupuncture and massage therapy, yoga naturopathy) [3] [4] [5] . T&CM use in Africa is considered a public health issue primarily due to its widespread use alone or alongside conventional medicine, with most studies showing more than half the population using T&CM [4] . In Sierra Leone, high use of T&CM, especially herbal medicines use, has been observed among pregnant women [6] , lactating mothers [7] , hypertensive patients [8] , infertile women [9] , healthcare students [10] and for the treatment of malaria in children [11] and adults [12] .",

The outbreak also produced the highest number of survivors in the three most affected countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. As of the 12 May 2016, the global estimate of EVD survivors was approximately 10,000 [14] . This number will increase as EVD outbreaks continue in other countries such in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) [15] . Survivors of EVD outbreaks experience a myriad of post-ebola physical and psychological complications, which include musculoskeletal pain, ocular and auditory problems, depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, as well as stigma and discrimination from the community [16] [17] [18] . Ebola survivors are known to seek conventional care to address their myriad health challenges [19, 20] and there is evidence of EVD survivors employing local cultural practices (which encompass T&CM) in their management of EVD transmission and prevention [21] [22] [23] . However, no research to date has evaluated the frequency and reasons for T&CM use among Ebola survivors.",

The first set of interpretations can loosely be referred to as pull factors, which focused on those features, and factors around T&CM that are attractive to users (pull factors). These pull factors regarding T&CM use that have been identified in the contemporary literature across sub-Saharan Africa suggest that people tend to be attracted to T&CM due to its perceived low cost, availability, congruence with their individual's cultural and religious beliefs, patient sense of autonomy over their health and their perceived safety and efficacy of T&CM products [4] . The second interpretation relates to people who are dissatisfied with what conventional medicine can offer (push factors). The contemporary literature across sub-Saharan Africa suggests that people seek T&CM due to disenchantment with conventional medicine, the negative attitude of healthcare providers to cultural traditions (including T&CM), drug availability, long distance to and inequity in accessing health facilities as well as long waiting times [4] . In addition, beliefs related to safety, efficacy, holism and the sense of control of one's health have been identified as possible predictors of T&CM use among different illness groups outside of Africa [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Given that unpublished data has suggested Ebola survivors are likely to seek T&CM healthcare in Sierra Leone to help meet their healthcare needs [29] , it is important to examine Ebola survivors' general beliefs regarding T&CM and how these beliefs are linked with their decision to use T&CM. Such information is important, as it will help healthcare providers and policymakers to understand better Ebola survivors' use and motivations for using T&CM, which will help minimise risks to patient care and invariably maximize patient care outcomes. These studies may also serve to identify 'push' and 'pull' factors that can help design more responsive health services for Ebola survivors. However, to date, no study in Sierra Leone or across Africa has evaluated Ebola survivors' attitudes towards the use of T&CM. To fill this significant research gap, our study evaluates Ebola survivors' attitudes towards the use of T&CM in Sierra Leone drawing upon a nationally representative sample.",

Table 1 shows the demographic and health-related characteristics between users and non-users of T&CM among Ebola survivors. More than half Ebola survivors were between the ages of 18-34 years (n = 194, 54.2%) and close to two thirds were females (n = 223, 62.3%). Moreover, close to three-quarters perceived their current health to be fair/poor (n = 262, 73.2%). Table 2 shows that close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T&CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Moreover, less than a quarter of survivors (n = 62, 17.3%) used both conventional medicine and T&CM concurrently. Herbal medicine (n = 136, 83.4%) is the most common type of T&CM used among T&CM users. Table 3 shows the attitudes towards use of T&CM by Ebola survivors. More than two thirds of participants (n = 257, 71.8%) believe that T&CM is 'natural'. Approximately three-quarters of survivors are of the view that T&CM needs to be tested for safety/side-effects and more than half (n = 213, 59.5%) report knowledge about the evidence of T&CM as important to them. In addition, the majority of Ebola survivors (n = 313, 87.4%) believe medical doctors should be able to advise patients about T&CM. On the other hand, more than half (n = 218, 60.9%) did not perceive T&CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine. Furthermore, more than two thirds (n = 250, 69.8%) did not perceive T&CM as promoting a holistic approach to health. In addition, less than one quarter (n = 73, 20.4%) perceived a T&CM practitioner as providing more support to their patients than a medical doctor. Table 4 outlines the association between T&CM use and individual attitudes of Ebola survivors. Attitude statements such as T&CM is more natural than conventional medicine (p < 0.001), T&CM boosts my immune system/resistance (p < 0.001), my personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM is more important than clinical evidence (p < 0.001), T&CM gives me more control over my health/body (p < 0.001), I find it easier to talk to a T&CM practitioner than a medical doctor (p < 0.001) and T&CM has fewer side-effects than conventional medicine (p < 0.001) are associated with T&CM use. No statistical difference was observed between T&CM users and non-users for the remaining attitude statements. Backward stepwise logistic regression (Table 5) found that survivors who agreed that T&CM boosts their immune system/resistance were 3.89 (95%CI: 1.57-9.63, p = 0.003) times more likely to use T&CM than those that disagreed. Ebola survivors who agreed with the statement that T&CM has fewer side effects than CM were 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92-13.19, p = 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM than those who disagreed. Ebola survivors were 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10-30.84, p < 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM if they considered important their personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM than clinical evidence. In addition, survivors who believe that T&CM gives them more control over their health/body were 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74-9.89, p = 0.001) times more likely to be T&CM users as opposed to those who disagreed with this statement.

The appeal of T&CM to boosting immunity among users in our study may be explained in that, an individual's health is a function of his/her immune status, which is in line with T&CM philosophies that disease should be managed by challenging the body to heal itself rather than focusing on symptomatic treatment [32] .",

This is perhaps unsurprising given the infectious nature of the viral disease that caused the acute episode. Although several T&CM approaches are reported to exert immunological changes in preclinical and clinical studies [36] , thus far, these studies have employed relatively insensitive and straightforward methodologies that render findings inconclusive. Methodologically robust clinical studies that use newer and more powerful technologies (magnetic-resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography and microarray analyses) are required to provide strong evidence on the immunomodulatory effect of T&CM that might be of use in the management of post-Ebola sequelae among survivors.",

The absence of clinical evidence of effectiveness and safety of the commonly used T&CM in the general population and among Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone, and coupled with the notion that T&CM is inherently safe and effective may help explain their preference for personal experience of T&CM over clinical evidence. While few preclinical efficacy [46, 47] and toxicity [48] studies of some medicinal plants considered traditional medicine have been conducted in Sierra Leone, clinical research examining the safety and efficacy of commonly used T&CM especially herbal medicines in Sierra Leone is lacking. The availability of scientific evidence of T&CM effectiveness and safety is important in ensuring that it is effectively used. T&CM users are known to assume that T&CM is safe and effective [4] and that their decision to use T&CM is informed by non-professionals sources [42] . Therefore, it is imperative that robust efficacy and safety studies (preclinical, clinical and post-market surveillance) are conducted on commonly used T&CM in Sierra Leone that will inform personal and clinical decision making with regards T&CM.",

Such reasons for T&CM use among Ebola survivors are useful to conventional health providers, in improving practitioner-patient communication regarding T&CM and identify survivors' beliefs about T&CM that might be targets for public education among Ebola survivors by policymakers and health providers.
