New and unrecognised cases drive the epidemic, with transmission usually occurring before the index case is diagnosed.

Respiratory and constitutional symptoms overlapping with those of pulmonary TB are very common in communities where TB is endemic [4] . In this scenario the challenge is to distinguish symptomatic patients with active TB from those with latent disease but whose presenting symptomatology is attributable to some other infectious or inflammatory process. In terms of rapid diagnosis, sputum microscopy will only identify approximately 50% of patients with active pulmonary TB. Conversely, while the interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) represent a major advance in the detection of latent TB, they cannot distinguish active TB from symptomatic patients with latent infection in this context [5, 6] . This overlap between LTBI, active TB and non-specific clinical manifestations presents a formidable obstacle to the rapid recognition of active TB and the timely and appropriate targeting of anti-TB chemotherapy or chemoprophylaxis. In practice this difficulty may give rise to 2 types of therapeutic error. In the first instance, erroneous diagnosis of active TB in a symptomatic patient with LTBI may result in inappropriate administration of full course TB treatment. Conversely, offering chemoprophylaxis to a patient with supposed LTBI in whom active TB has not been recognized, will drive emergence of drug resistance.",

Spectral peaks corresponding to mass/charge (m/z) clusters were detected and clustered using the ProteinChipH Data Manager Client 3.5 software (BioRad Inc.) by auto-detecting peaks to clusters in two steps. For the first step a signal to noise ratio of 5 and valley depth of 3 were used, with a minimum peak threshold of 20% of all spectra. For the second step a signal to noise ratio of 3 and valley depth of 1 were chosen. The cluster window was set at 1.0 peak width and expression difference mapping performed over m/z range of 2,500 to 200,000. Instrument calibration was performed using All-in-1 Peptide and Protein calibrants (Bio-Rad).

For the final model parameters, we selected those that gave the overall highest accuracy across the whole 10 fold cross validation. We next selected a subset of the most relevant mass clusters using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm [20] which ranks variables based on their contribution to the classifier. To obtain accuracy estimates for the classifier, we took 1000 random resamplings of the original data, using 90% for training and 10% for testing. We selected as a final classifier the one that produced the highest accuracy while requiring the smallest number of m/z clusters. Results were expressed as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (proportion of correct classifications) and as Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. We assessed the different performances of classifiers derived from crude and pre-fractionated plasma by comparing mean values for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy using unpaired 2-tailed t tests.

This both reinforces and substantially extends our previous findings where we first showed that proteomic patterns could be used as a diagnostic approach for active TB [12] . We have now shown that the proteomic pattern does not merely reflect the presence of TB infection per se. Rather, it can be used to identify active TB even in a highly TB-endemic setting with high prevalence of both respiratory symptoms and background LTBI. (a,b) active TB vs. all symptomatic controls using crude or pre-fractionated plasma respectively; (c,d) active TB vs. symptomatic controls with latent TB using crude or pre-fractionated plasma respectively; (e,f) active TB vs. symptomatic controls without latent TB using crude or pre-fractionated plasma respectively. The ROCs are derived from 1000 random train/test resamplings of the data. Error bars show standard deviations. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is shown in the centre of each plot. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0038080.g005 Table 2 . Discrimination of active from latent tuberculosis in symptomatic patients. The ability to discriminate rapidly in a symptomatic patient between active TB and non-tuberculous disease has profound implications for both individual clinical management and TB control programs [21] . For example, current diagnostic limitations frequently result in many patients in resource-poor settings being treated empirically for community acquired pneumonia before eventual diagnosis of active TB. This may lead to on-going transmission during the interval preceding diagnosis as well as greater individual morbidity. The alternative strategy of empirical anti-TB chemotherapy is sometimes employed, but cost, toxicity and logistics often preclude this. Adjuncts to conventional microbiology for diagnosis of active TB in widespread use include the TST and IGRAs. The use of TSTs in the diagnosis of active TB in high prevalence settings is greatly limited by its poor specificity for active TB as reactivity is also seen in LTBI, previous BCG vaccination and exposure to environmental mycobacteria. Nor has the recent introduction of IGRAs into clinical practice resolved this key diagnostic issue. This is because of their inability to distinguish active TB from LTBI [6] and frequent false negative results in acute active TB [22] , limitations which are especially problematic in high prevalence settings [23] . Thus a diagnostic that overcomes these limitations is urgently required and would be a major advance in the management of the global TB pandemic. Recently it has been reported that a TNF-alpha + TB-specific CD4+response can be used to differentiate latent infection from active TB but the sensitivity was just 67% [24] . Moreover, that study relied on polychromatic flow cytometry limiting the feasibility of being translated in high prevalence settings. In contrast, our approach provides improved accuracy, 87%, by detecting relevant protein biomarkers in plasma. Despite the discovery-phase of our approach using sophisticated proteomic methodologies, the identification of relevant plasma proteins leads to a clear translational path for antibody-based point-of-care devices that can be used to measure these plasma proteins in the future.",

The power of this approach is reflected by the recent granting of FDA approval of a novel blood test derived from a SELDI-based fingerprinting method, for distinguishing malignant from benign ovarian tumours [27, 28] . In many infectious diseases, there are clinically important distinctions to be made between different manifestations associated with the same underlying pathogen. For example, distinguishing colonization or latent disease from active infection has obvious clinical and therapeutic implications. TB is a clear case in point. Proteomic fingerprinting has enormous potential for defining and distinguishing these disease states but has only recently received attention in this area [12] [13] [14] [29] [30] [31] . Because the circulation samples deep tissues throughout the body, local proteomic changes in organs such as the lungs can be reflected in the plasma proteome. Moreover, host modulation by the pathogen is likely to generate changing patterns of protein expression associated with different clinical manifestations. Thus the plasma proteomic response is a plausible index of disease state. Proteomic patterns are highly dynamic and it may be possible to define those that reflect stages in progression from latency to active disease. However, the complexity of the plasma proteome with its enormous dynamic range of solute concentrations means that detection of informative lower abundance proteins is particularly challenging. It is possible that differences between active TB and LTBI in symptomatic patients are reflected better by such lower abundance proteins not easily detectable in crude plasma. This may explain the higher specificity for active TB obtained from prefractionated as compared to the crude plasma spectra.",

Moreover, this study shows that active TB can be identified by a blood test in a population of community TB clinic attenders, on a background of non-TB attributable symptoms, despite the coexistence of LTBI. Ultimately, a significant impact on control of TB in high prevalence settings will depend on the ability to translate these findings into a robust, affordable point-of-care format. Incorporation of a panel of biomarkers derived from this study into a lateral flow device or similar platform is the logical next step. Finally, the utility of defining proteomic patterns in TB may extend beyond diagnostics to provide new methods for monitoring treatment response and disease stage.",
