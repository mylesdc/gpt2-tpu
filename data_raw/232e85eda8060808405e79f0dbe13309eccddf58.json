            "text": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the most severe form of malaria with several complications. The malaria pigment-hemozoin (Hz) is associated with severe anemia, cytokine dysfunction, and immunosuppression, thus making it an interesting target for developing new strategies for antimalarial therapy. Monocytes (MO) in circulation actively ingest Hz released by Plasmodium parasites and secrete pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines. M1 and M2 types represent the two major forms of MO/ macrophages (MQ) with distinct phenotypes and opposing functions. Imbalance in the polarization of these types is reported in many infectious diseases. Though the association of Hz with immunosuppression is well documented, its role in activation of MO in context of M1/M2 phenotypes remains to be addressed. We report here that natural Hz drives human MO toward M2-like phenotype as evidenced by the expression of M2 signature markers. Hz-fed MO showed elevated transcript and secreted level of IL-10, CCL17, CCL1, expression of mannose-binding lectin receptor (CD206), and arginase activity. Hz attenuated HLA-DR expression, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species production, which are the features of M1 phenotype. Our data also implicate the involvement of p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in skewing of Hz-fed MO toward M2-like type and suppression of mitogenstimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Importantly, antimalarial drugs-chloroquine and artemisinin-partially reversed activation of Hz-induced MO toward M2-like phenotype. Considering the limitations in the current therapeutic options for malaria, we propose that these drugs may be re-examined for their potential as immunomodulators and candidates for adjunctive treatment in malaria.

Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria with complications that include cerebral malaria, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, or severe anemia (Buffet et al., 2011; Das, 2008; Medana & Turner, 2006; Mohan, Sharma, & Bollineni, 2008) . P. falciparum malaria is frequently associated with immunosuppression and increased secondary infections (Hu, 2013; Ihekwereme, Esimone, & Nwanegbo, 2014; Orf & Cunnington, 2015; Troye-Blomberg & Perlmann, 1988) . Immunosuppression enhances parasitemia and reduces immune responses to not only malaria parasite proteins but other pathogens as well. Accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of parasite and host factors is involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.",

            "text": "During the intra-erythrocytic stages, P. falciparum parasites digest hemoglobin in the food vacuole, resulting in the production of potentially toxic heme metabolites (Francis, Sullivan, & Goldberg, 1997) , which the parasite detoxifies by converting it to an insoluble crystal called malarial pigment or hemozoin (Hz) (Arese & Schwarzer, 1997) . During schizogeny, Hz is released into blood and avidly phagocytosed by human phagocytic cells including monocytes (MO) (Shio, Kassa, Bellemare, & Olivier, 2010) . As a result of Hz uptake, several functions of MO such as repeated phagocytosis (Schwarzer et al., 1992) , bactericidal abilities (Fiori et al., 1993) , oxidative burst, MHC Class II expression, antigen presentation (Scorza, Magez, Brys, & De Baetselier, 1999) , and maturation to dendritic cells (Urban & Todryk, 2006) are severely affected. MO actively respond to ingested natural Hz by secretion of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-10, IL-8, and chemokines, CCL2, CCL3 CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5 (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004; Giribaldi et al., 2010) .

The cycling parameters were as follows: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s, and then 72\u00b0C for 30 s for a total of 40 cycles. The comparative threshold cycle (C t ) value for GAPDH was used to normalize loading variations in the real-time PCR. The extent of mRNA expression for a given condition was represented by the relative value to the lower DDCT between those estimated for the different conditions: the control DDCT value was fixed at 1.0. The specificity of PCR was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Real-time PCR was done on thermocycler Applied Biosystems 7300 (Applied Biosystems).",

IL-10, a well-characterized antiinflammatory cytokine implicated in M2 polarization, was elevated at transcript level following Hz exposure (Figure 1a ). Consistent with our previous work (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004) , a strong induction of secreted and cellular IL-10 was observed (Figure 1b and Supporting Information Figure S3a ). The transcript and secreted level of IL-12p70 was assessed in Hz-fed MO, and treatment with LPS + IFN\u03b3 was used as positive control. Interestingly, Hz phagocytosis did not alter the IL-12p70 level. As expected, the production of IL-12 was increased in MO exposed to LPS + IFN\u03b3 (Supporting Information Figure S3b ,c). M1 phenotype is also induced by microbial products through TLR ligands (Murray & Wynn, 2011; Murray et al., 2014; Wang, Liang, & Zen, 2014) . Therefore, additional experiments were conducted to examine TLR engagement in Hz-driven MO activation. MO exposed to natural Hz were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blotting for expression of TLR9. \u03b2-Hematin (sHz) was used as a reference for flow cytometry analysis (Coban et al., 2005) . As shown in Supporting Information Figure S4a ,b, natural Hz had no effect on TLR9 expression, sug- Results are M \u00b1 SEM from at least three independent donors.

The amount of Hz in the range of 25-75\u03bcg/ml significantly elevated the secreted levels of IL-10, CCL17, CCL1, and surface expression of CD206 in MO (Supporting Information Figure S5c ). Interestingly, CXCL13 and CD163 (markers related to M2c phenotype) were unaltered under similar experimental conditions (Supporting Information Figure S6 ).",

It is noteworthy in this context that regulatory T cells suppress T-cell responses in malaria (Hisaeda et al., 2004) . Furthermore, Hz induces production of M2b-specific cytokines-TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in human MO. These data corroborate with reports demonstrating the presence of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6 along with high level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in plasma of malaria patients (Perera et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2016) .",

In this study, Hz F I G U R E 5 Proposed model for hemozoin (Hz)-induced M2-like monocytes (MO) during infection. Hz released after schizont rupture is ingested by circulating MO in blood, activates PI3K-AKT, NF-\u03baB, and p38 MAPK pathways, resulting in increased expression of M2 markers IL-10, CD206, arginase activity. Specifically, Hz induces M2a (CCL1) and M2b (CCL17, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) phenotype that regulate TH2 responses. Hz attenuates HLA-DR expression, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species-features of M1 phenotype. Antimalarial drugs-artemisinin and chloroquine-partially reverse the Hz-induced M2-like phenotype activated p38 MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and NF-\u03baB pathways and pharmacological inhibitors for these pathways dramatically down-regulated the expression and secretion of IL-10, thus, over-riding the induction triggered by Hz exposure. In line with this observation, the inhibitors effectively reduced Hz-induced M2-like phenotypic, biochemical, and functional properties. While these findings implicate the role of p38 MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and NF-\u03baB pathways, we cannot rule out the possibility of other signaling pathways in Hz-driven activation of MO toward M2 phenotype. Since Hz does not induce a specific phenotype subset but drives the MO toward M2a and M2b types, it may be postulated that Hz stimulates atypical activation mediated through PI3K-AKT, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB pathways.",

ART have been reported to decrease IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 levels (Shakir, Hussain, Javeed, Ashraf, & Riaz, 2011; Wu et al., 2016) through MAPK (Wang et al., 2009) , NF-\u03baB (Prato, Gallo, Giribaldi, Aldieri, & Arese, 2010; Wang et al., 2011) , and PI3K-AKT (Kim et al., 2013) pathways. CHQ has also been demonstrated to act through MAPK (Kono et al., 2008; Weber, Chen, & Levitz, 2002) and NF-\u03baB (Long, Liu, Wang, Zhou, & Zheng, 2015; Yang et al., 2013) pathways and decrease IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 in mononuclear phagocytes in different diseases (Jang et al., 2006; Long et al., 2015) . In another study, CHQ has been shown to be an effective anticancer drug in mice by inhibiting tumor resistant MQ (M2 MQ) and decreasing TGF\u03b2 and IL-10 production. The effect was accompanied by decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Tregs, and increasing CD8 + T cells in tumor milieu . The ability of these drugs to inhibit crucial pathways and production of cytokines/chemokines that are signature for M2 type MO has extended their use for other parasitic diseases, rheumatic diseases, and cancer. In our study, the drugs were found to be more effective in reducing the expression of phenotypic markers-cytokines, chemokines, and surface marker-CD206 associated with M2-like phenotype than reversing altered biochemical and functional properties. ART did not reverse arginase activity in Hz-fed MO. Our finding is supported by an earlier report that ART did not significantly alter arginase activity in leishmania donovani-infected MQ though it enhanced protective immune responses by reversing NO levels (Sen, Ganguly, Saha, & Chatterjee, 2010) . These observations are not surprising as CHQ and ART are known for their antimalarial action through multiple modes on their target, but their mechanism of action as immunomodulators is not clearly elucidated. The M2 phenotype is previously related to abnormal autophagy and angiogenesis (Li et al., 2016) . We speculate that CHQ, a known autophagy inhibitor, may attenuate Hz-induced M2-like MO activation by inhibiting autophagy. Previously, falciparum malaria pathogenesis has been related to upregulated angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang-2, and sFLT-1 along with dysregulated and excessive immune responses (Muehlenbachs, Mutabingwa, Edmonds, Fried, & Duffy, 2006; Silver, Higgins, McDonald, & Kain, 2010) . The antiparasitic action of ART is accompanied with disruption of parasite proteins, alteration of mitochondrial functions, and angiogenesis (Ak, 2015; Shakir et al., 2011) . In relation to ability of M2 phenotype to stimulate angiogenesis, ART may attenuate Hz-induced M2-like phenotype by altering the release of angiogenic factors.",

Hz released after schizont rupture is readily ingested by circulating MO in blood; activates PI3K-AKT, NF-\u03baB, and p38 MAPK pathways resulting in increased expression of M2 markers; and drives the MO toward M2 (M2a and M2b)-like phenotype. Antimalarial drugs-ART and CHQ-partially reverse the process of activation of MO toward M2-like phenotype. In conclusion, the findings from this study add a new dimension to the understanding of mechanism/s underlying Hz-induced immunosuppression by demonstrating its ability to drive the MO toward M2-like phenotype. Though antimalarial resistance poses a major challenge and discourages the continuation of CHQ and ART, we propose that these drugs may be re-examined for their potential as immunomodulators and candidates for adjunctive treatment in malaria.",

HLA-DR, a M1 phenotyperelated marker, was significantly down-regulated as observed by decrease of MFI in response to Hz exposure (Figure 1c). Recent reports employing differential gene expression and chemokine profiles have ascribed three subtypes in the M2 phenotype. To identify the M2 subtypes generated following Hz phagocytosis, we assessed the expression of subset-specific chemokines-CCL17 (M2a), CCL1 (M2b), and CXCL13 (M2c). Hz-fed MO robustly elevated transcript level of CCL17 and CCL1 (Figure 1d).

            "text": "The immune system acts like a double-edged sword, wherein interplay among anti-and pro-inflammatory responses dictates disease outcome. Hence, studies on interactions between host and parasite components are important to provide a better understanding of factors affecting directionality of immune response. MO, an important constituent of mononuclear phagocytic system, plays an important role during parasite infection. Parasite components, including Hz, released during the erythrocytic cycle are readily taken up by patrolling MO. The ingested Hz is accumulated and affects the accessory functions of MO and other immune cells, which in-turn may contribute to immunosuppression seen in malaria. We show here that Hz drives MO toward M2-like phenotype and is mediated by PI3K-AKT, NF-\u03baB, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Antimalarial drugs-CHQ and ART-partially reversed Hz-induced M2-like phenotype, thereby supporting their immunomodulatory role. Blood mononuclear phagocytes display plasticity and have the ability to polarize toward M1 or M2 phenotypes in response to environmental stimuli. Findings from our study demonstrate that Hz drives human MO toward M2-like phenotype, as characterized by the expression of phenotypic markers including elevated IL-10, mannose receptor expression CD206, and arginase activity. Hz-induced M2-like MO comprise of M2a and M2b subtypes based on the expression of CCL17 and CCL1. Since chemokines, CCL17 and CCL1, function as agonists for CCR4 and CCR8 receptors, respectively",
