The effect of UV index was highest among young strata and decreased with age. At shorter time scales, only an association with increases in ambient sulphur oxides was linked to disease risk (OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93).",

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactam agents, macrolides, and other antibiotic classes is an important clinical concern [11] . Although the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines has been associated with a reduction in disease incidence [12] , the recent increase in invasive infection by non-vaccine serotypes [13] , which may be highly resistant to commonly-used antimicrobials [14] , suggests that this microorganism will persist in challenging both the medical and public health communities.",

Information pertaining to air quality in Philadelphia County during the years of interestincluding concentrations of lead, ozone, sulphur oxides and particulate matter-was obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency [20] . Because daily readings were taken at various locations throughout the region, the arithmetic means of the air quality values were used as exposure variables. UV index forecast estimates for Philadelphia during the same period were retrieved from the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center [21] . Clear-sky UV indices represent an integral of measured UV radiation levels weighted by the ability of the different UV wavelengths to cause skin erythema. The issued UV index is a similar measure, which accounts for the effect of clouds on radiation transmission; because of inconsistencies in cloud measurement during the study period, we used the clear-sky UV index as our exposure variable.",

Random directionality of control selection was used in order to avoid biases that can occur with unidirectional or uniform bidirectional control selection [26] . The 1-3 day incubation period of S. pneumoniae was used to estimate the lag days between acute environmental occurrence and case onset, or plausible effect period [28] . We also evaluated effects during the period immediately preceding incubation (i.e., 4-6 day lags) to evaluate the possibility that environmental conditions might affect risk via enhanced transmission of S. pneumoniae. We evaluated the effects of both raw environmental exposures, and quantile ranks within time strata through construction of conditional logistic regression models [24] . Analyses were performed using SAS version 8.01 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata version 9.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). Both spectral decomposition and construction of autocorrelograms identified annual periodicity of infection, with peak incidence in mid-February (phase = 6 weeks) (Figures 1 and 2) . Strong statistical evidence for seasonal oscillation was obtained from Poisson regression models (P for seasonal oscillation < 0.001). A significant annual increase in incidence was seen throughout the study period, though this was more marked prior to 2004 (IRR per year 1.34, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.66) than subsequently (IRR 1.22, per year 95% 1.16 to 1.34) (Figure 3 ).

The seasonality of IPD is well recognized, but poorly understood. Epidemiological mechanisms invoked to explain this pattern have included co-occurrence of other infectious diseases [4] , wintertime social gatherings [5] , and seasonal oscillation in immune function [29] . However, concurrent seasonal changes in a variety of environmental, behavioural, and epidemiogical exposures make identification of causal associations particularly challenging [30] . We attempted to address this challenge by using analytic approaches that should control for seasonal confounders, known and unknown, at different time scales. At a weekly time scale we found increases in UV radiation to be most strongly associated with decreased numbers of invasive pneumococcal disease cases, though average temperatures also appeared to influence disease risk. At short time scales, fluctuations in ambient air quality, as manifested by differences in concentrations of sulphur oxides, were associated with changes in risk. The direction of this association was at variance with existing models relating air pollution to pneumonia occurrence [3, 31, 32] .",

The degree to which such seasonal oscillation can result in \"just so\" stories that lead to misattribution of causation to non-specific seasonal exposures is highlighted in the univariable analyses we conducted without including seasonal oscillators. In these models, a variety of environmental conditions, including weather variables and air quality indices, were strongly associated with IPD risk. However, after controlling for non-specific seasonality, only UV radiation (and, more weakly, temperature) were associated with disease risk; indeed, the apparent protective effect of UV radiation was actually strengthened after controlling for seasonal oscillation.",

Spectral density is represented on the y-axis, and can be conceptualized as a measure of goodness-of-fit for oscillatory regression models at different frequencies. The large peak at a frequency of 51 weeks suggests that invasive pneumococcal disease is a process that oscillates with annual periodicity (and is, in other words, compatible with wintertime seasonality). The two peaks at lower frequencies are lower harmonics illustrating bi-and tri-annual behaviour.",

Namely, enhanced maturation of macrophages, macrophage secretion of bactericidal substances such as lysozomal enzyme phosphatase and hydrogen peroxide [33, 35] , and secretion of antimicrobial peptides (including cathelicidins and defensins) by both immune cells, and respiratory tract epithelium [36] . Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a marked increase in the risk of pneumonia [37] , and most human vitamin D is acquired via sun exposure. Thus, extended periods of low UV light could result in an increased susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection resulting from a lack of vitamin D production, though the week-to-week fluctuations in risk described in this paper may be too rapid to represent a vitamin D effect.",

Many bacterial respiratory pathogens, including pneumococcus, are transmitted in respiratory secretions over short distances (i.e., via \"large droplet transmission\"), and thus encounter the physical environment directly during transmission events. The bactericidal effects of UV-B radiation have been well known for decades; such radiation inactivates bacteria by causing harmful genetic mutations through creation of pyrimidine dimers [38] . A model of UV effect via diminished transmissibility, rather than decreased host susceptibility, is supported by our finding that UV effect is strongest in the youngest individuals in the population (i.e., toddlers), where disease risk is likely to be driven by mobility, contact with peers, prolonged carriage and carelessness with respiratory secretions. We found very little protective effect against IPD in oldest individuals, whose risk may be more strongly linked to immune senescence than to high rates of contact with infectious contemporaries [39, 40] .",

However, selection bias will only be introduced if the notification of infectious diseases to public health was correlated with meteorological patterns (e.g., cases which occur during days with higher UV index have a greater likelihood of being diagnosed and reported), which seems unlikely [44] . Second, we obtained weather data from a single site at Philadelphia International Airport, and air pollution and UV data were averaged over several locations throughout the county, which may not represent the true exposure status of individual cases. This is 8 0 a n d o v e r probable non-differential misclassification, and will bias the results towards the null hypothesis.

As the nature of future changes in UV radiation related to climate change are more difficult to predict than general changes in temperatures or precipitation patterns, the implications of these findings for future pneumococcal disease epidemiology are unclear [45] . Nonetheless, we believe this obser-vation goes some way towards explaining the notable seasonality of IPD, and could conceivably lead to novel disease control strategies through improved understanding of this common and virulent infectious disease.
