Other studies report that 60 to 70% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) events in humans are of animal origin [2, 3] . The rising number of emerging zoonoses may be driven by \"modernization of farming practices, particularly in the developing world, habitat destruction, human encroachment and climate change\" [3] to support a growing population [4] . This phenomenon holds true in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries where 70% of the public health emergencies in the Americas reported to the WHO from 2007 to 2008 were classified as zoonoses or communicable diseases common to humans and animals [5] .",

The likely heterogeneity between Ministries and between countries, about priority diseases, prioritization criteria, and capacity building needs could translate into vulnerabilities in the countries' zoonoses control efforts.

Ministries did not frequently report the use of public opinion, animal welfare or DALYs as prioritizing criteria. This could be due to the difficulty of measuring them, integrating them with the other criteria, and in the case of public opinion and animal welfare to an implicit reduced relevance relative to other criteria deemed as more important. Public opinion however is a frequently used criterion in decision frameworks involving public goods or services, with multiple impacts and stakeholders, and shaped by severe uncertainty [17] . This decision context appears to apply to many of the zoonoses prioritized by the Ministries. Similarly, DALYs did not rank prominently, probably due to the lack of data to consistently inform such a composite metric for many of the neglected zoonoses. This argument supports earlier reports on the shortage of studies regarding the burden of many zoonoses in the Region [9] . Recent publications have started to fill this gap, including an estimate of intermediate burdens of foodborne DALYs, many of which are zoonotic, for the LAC region [10] . An FAO/WHO initiative using an expert-based multicriteria ranking tool for assessing foodborne parasitic diseases noted a deficit of data for Central American countries, but the same was not noted for South American countries [18] .",

This would compensate for the concentration of MAgs competencies focused on the importance of the livestock sector as a national product, and enhance the current unclear role of veterinary governance on poverty reduction [19] .",

The majority of respondents used expert opinion (59%) or other approaches. While 70% of ministries replied that they perform prioritization exercises for endemic diseases or gave a time frame for prioritization, our results fall short of the proportion of IHR Core Capacity Implementation respondents survey who reported having a list of priority zoonoses (94%) with case definitions [22] . This difference in proportion may be due to a difference in respondents or it may also denote the proportion of ad-hoc prioritization exercises which occur in the region. Future studies will have to explore the robustness of these ad-hoc approaches.",

This required some judgment by the authors that led to some loss of information (e.g. pooling answers referring to canine or sylvatic rabies under the rabies category combined two different epidemiological entities that warrant different controls by different Ministries).

Although not presented here, individual countries and Ministries can be profiled to help identify potential vulnerable hot-spots that warrant technical cooperation from neighboring countries and international agencies. Regional and country-specific profiles allow comparisons with the countries responses to the annual IHR Core Capacity Implementation Survey. In 2013, 97% of the countries within the Americas region reported coordination within government for the detection and response to zoonotic events, and 97% had functional mechanisms for collaboration between animal and human health units such as intersectoral surveillance units and laboratories [22] . These compare with the results of the present survey where Ministries were asked to rank the relationship with their counterparts. None of the Ministries ranked their collaboration with the other Ministry as non-existent. In fact, the majority of Ministries ranked the collaboration as very or overall productive (69%). Yet, many Ministries suggested improvements through regular meetings, formalized MoUs, and data sharing. The latter entails a highly evolved relationship and well developed processes between parties and is uncommon, as reported by Vrbova et al. [23] who found that only 19% of the surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses considered both human and animal data. On a related topic, albeit less demanding of sophisticated structures and processes to support useful data sharing, the 2013 IHR Core Capacity Implementation survey reported that 80% of countries in the Americas had a timely and systematic exchange of information between the animal and human sectors [22] . Because so few MAgs have a dedicated zoonoses group (20%), the collection and sharing of data beneficial to both parties is likely to remain a challenge. For emerging zoonoses, given the low proportion of respondents that replied that they had an MoU with their counterpart (Fig 6) , opportunities to improve this specific capacity appear possible. This is likely to hold true only for those zoonoses that have both a significant public health and an economic impact (e.g. BSE, AI). For other conditions, MoH may not perceive much benefit in establishing an MoU with MAgs, due to the little involvement of the latter in the control of zoonoses, e.g leptospirosis.",

In the case of Chikungunya, although the reported probability of introduction was high, the proportion of Ministries that conducted simulation exercises was low. A possible explanation is that Chikungunya response plans could be embedded within the response plans of other arboviruses. Finally, although the majority of countries (64%) classified the probability of EVD introduction as very improbable or improbable, the proportion of countries that comprehensively prepared for it was large (Fig 6) , indicating that the impact of the disease weighed relatively more in their decisions.",

Such integration would lead to improved control and eradication programmes as well as conservation of resources. Numerous activities, some of them captured by our survey, e.g. a regional report on zoonoses and the development of regional mechanisms to manage emerging zoonoses, would be better delivered through such an overarching strategy.
