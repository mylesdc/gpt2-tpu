            "text": "Africa. Here we describe a model designed to provide initial quantitative predictions of the risk of entry of such viruses to European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) through four routes: human travel, legal trade (e.g. fruit and animal products), live animal movements and illegal importation of bushmeat. The model utilises available datasets to assess the movement via these routes between individual countries of the world and EU MSs. These data are combined with virus specific data to assess the relative risk of entry between EU MSs. As a case study, the model was parameterised for NiV. Scenario analyses showed that the selection of exporting countries with NiV and potentially contaminated trade products were essential to the accuracy of all model outputs. Uncertainty analyses of other model parameters identified that the model expected number of years to an introduction event within the EU was highly susceptible to the prevalence of NiV in bats. The relative rankings of the MSs and routes, however, were more robust. The UK, the Netherlands and Germany were consistently the most likely points of entry and the ranking of most MSs varied by no more than three places (maximum variation five places). Legal trade was consistently the most likely route of entry, only falling below human travel when the estimate of the prevalence of NiV in bats was particularly low. Any model-based calculation is dependent on the data available to feed into the model and there are distinct gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regard to various pathogen/virus as well as host/bat characteristics. However, the strengths of this model lie in the provision of relative comparisons of risk among routes and MSs. The potential for expansion of the model to include other routes and viruses and the possibility of rapid parameterisation demonstrates its potential for use in an outbreak situation.",

            "text": "In the current era there are many factors which connect disparate parts of the world, from tourism to immigration and legal trade of goods to illegal trade of wild animals. However, along with the inarguable benefits of such globalisation comes risk to human health. One of the biggest risks of an interconnected world is the potential spread of zoonotic diseases. In recent times, we have seen geographical spread of cases of viruses such as Avian Influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) at unprecedented distances from the initial source of the outbreak. This raises the concern that other viruses that are currently restricted to more localised geographic areas, such as Nipah Virus (NiV), may spread to many other countries. If entry of the virus occurs, there is the possibility of exposure and transmission to humans, wildlife and/or livestock. As an example, an airline passenger infected with EBOV entered Nigeria from Liberia and infected nine medical staff and an airport official [1] . It is likely that such events will be sporadic and that, within the EU, there will be rapid implementation of control measures to contain them. However, if the initial control measures were to be ineffective, free trade and movement between European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) could increase the risk that disease arising within one MS could quickly spread within the EU. Spread within the EU will of course depend on a number of other factors, such as whether the virus can get established, but if unprepared, the consequences of virus entry could potentially be severe leading to an epidemic, or even pandemic. Such consequences have been witnessed in West Africa where over 20,000 suspected cases and 7,800 deaths have been reported due to the 2014 EBOV outbreak [2] , which has been suggested originated from only one human index case involving spill-over from a wildlife reservoir [3] .",

Bats infected with such viruses seldom display clinical signs but may shed virus in urine, faeces or saliva [6, 9] . As such, they are a likely vector for both direct and indirect transmission to humans and other animals. There have been cases of NiV in Bangladesh most years since it was first documented in 2001; in 2014 there were 30 human cases including 18 deaths [10] . The main risk factor for initial human infection with the Bangladesh strain of NiV is thought to be consumption of date palm sap contaminated by bats [11] , but more than half of the identified cases have resulted from person-to-person transmission [12] . Looking ahead, particularly with current anthropogenic activities (e.g. deforestation, hunting of wildlife for bushmeat), it is possible that there will be further spill-overs of viruses from bat populations to local wildlife and human populations in areas where there have previously been limited interactions [13] . This coupled with our intricately connected world through trade and travel provides new opportunities for wide-spread transmission of the viruses upon the initial spill-over event.",

While this aim has been achieved, there is a reasonable level of uncertainty in model outputs, due to the need for quality data to be available for all countries and the data gaps surrounding virus specific parameters such as prevalence and viral loads in animal species.",

Under traditional OIE guidelines, there are three components of risk assessment: entry assessment, exposure assessment and consequence assessment. This framework only considers the entry assessment, stopping at the point at which the virus is introduced into the EU, which we define to be prior to checks at customs/border inspection posts. Thus, any infected connecting passengers (i.e. passengers who do not leave the airport before boarding another flight out of the country) and/or contaminated products stopped or seized at EU customs or border inspection posts are considered to have constituted an introduction event. The model does not consider the potential exposure of humans, livestock or wildlife to the virus and the subsequent consequences given incursion.",

In addition to this, workshops have been undertaken within specific EU MSs to investigate the most likely pathways for importation of exotic animal diseases [24] [25] [26] . Using this information, in conjunction with the risk factors identified as important in a previous review [27] , the main routes included in the baseline model were human travel, P H (j), legal trade of 'at risk' products (e.g. non-animal foodstuffs such as fruit products and products of animal origin), P G (j), legal movement of susceptible animals (e.g. livestock, companion animals and those destined for scientific research or zoos), P A (j), and illegal bushmeat trade, P B (j). As Eq 1 is multiplicative with respect to the routes, the choice of routes can be amended for different viruses; e.g. inclusion of other routes, such as movement of bats, both accidental (e.g. stowaway in a boat) and through natural migration, that were not considered in the baseline model as previous research considered them to be of lower priority [27] .",

There is evidence that bats are often smoked, which could reduce the viability of viral particles within the meat, but there was insufficient evidence to determine by how much and whether this would be sufficient to negate the risk of infection upon consumption, as supported by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report [19] . Bushmeat can arrive at EU MSs by freight or post, but in this model we only consider the arrival of bushmeat in the luggage of aircraft passengers.",

The model utilises large, freely available, global datasets on human travel, legal trade and live animal movements to assess the volume of traffic between individual countries of the world and EU MSs. The main strengths of this model approach lie in the comparison of the relative risk of introduction between EU MSs, running hypothetical future scenarios to investigate the impact of a change in factors such as trade patterns or human demographics, interrogating what data are available and suggesting areas where further research would be useful. The model was parameterised for NiV, using what were considered the most likely parameter estimates. However, due to the scarcity of data on NiV for some of the model parameters there were inevitably data gaps in the model, in particular with regards to the prevalence of infection in animals and the probability of contamination of trade products in the exporting countries. As such, multiple scenario analyses were conducted, the results of which should be considered as plausible alternatives alongside the baseline results.",

The risk from pets and other live animals was very low in comparison to all other routes, likely because the model estimated that there were only around 200 relevant animals entering the EU from the exporting countries. The scenarios suggested that the relative ranking of the EU MSs and the routes of introduction were fairly robust to changes in the NiV parameter estimates, but were susceptible to changes in the exporting countries and at risk products considered. For example, in the scenario without grapes, Sweden dropped from 5 th to11 th and Estonia from 18 th to 25 th , as it was their predominant fruit import from the exporting countries in question. This highlights the importance of the import data and how a change in demand for a product may alter the associated risk.

Another area of uncertainty is the future: the model estimates of time until an introduction event are based on the assumption that parameter values remain constant over time. However, this is unlikely to actually be the case; for example, there has been a continuing general increase in airline travel to EU countries over recent years, which if it were to continue could potentially impact both the human travel and bushmeat routes in the model. Therefore, the model should be updated with new data when available and results reassessed. Projections in future changes (growth or decline) in the parameters could be considered in future models to improve accuracy, although uncertainties around these may limit the added value of increasing the complexity of the model in this way; for example, while the general trend of an increase in airline travel may continue this may not necessarily be the case in the specific countries considered, due to factors such as social or political change.",

We have assumed a high level of underreporting of illegal bushmeat, but if targeted testing is effective the actual level could be much lower. We assumed, based on a previous US study, that a fairly low proportion of bushmeat is from bats, 1.5% [35] , but given the level of human travel from some countries in South East Asia this still results in an estimate of well over 1000 people bringing in bushmeat to some MSs each year. Coupled with our estimate of NiV prevalence in bats, which is higher than the estimated prevalence for other animals, this resulted in a higher risk for 'bat' compared to 'non-bat' bushmeat. It should be remembered that the model does not include effects of any processing of bushmeat, which could reduce the risk of contamination.",

            "text": "Validation of the model is difficult as there are few data on the risk of NiV introduction to the EU aside from the fact that NiV has not been detected in the EU to date. Our baseline results indicate that, if the modelled situation were to continue unchanged, it would likely be hundreds of years before NiV is introduced via human travel or live animals, which would be consistent with it never having been detected via these routes. The result that legal trade is the most likely route of introduction of NiV is in agreement with the results of a previous qualitative entry assessment of henipaviruses into the UK [20] . The model does not consider the exposure and consequence stages of a full risk assessment, which are also important in contextualising the results. For example, an introduction event via legal trade is unlikely to have the same impact (e.g. outbreak or establishment of disease) as an introduction event via human travel as such risks depend on the various exposure pathways upon importation of disease and the quantity to which the susceptible human/livestock is exposed via the different commodities. In this entry assessment model, any infected 'connectors' (i.e. passengers who will not leave the airport between connecting flights) constitute an introduction to the MS. If we were considering exposure and consequence, then the risk from these connectors may be much smaller than passengers who will leave the airport and enter the MS. However, there are data to suggest that a reasonable proportion of UK connectors are going onto other EU countries [44] , highlighting the significant interconnectedness of the EU and that an introduction event into one MS poses a risk for the whole EU.",

As such, the model does not consider some of the more complex issues with regards to virus transmission such as seasonality of fruit (the harvesting season of some products may not overlap with when bats are likely to shed virus), climacteric fruits (some fruits are deliberately picked unripe for export and, as such, are unlikely to be in contact with bats who generally prefer fully ripe fruit), the degree of overlap of fruit orchards with susceptible bat populations (affecting probability of bat contact with raw produce), individuals who may be engaging in high risk practices (e.g. healthcare workers, tourists visiting bat caves [63] and attending traditional funerals [1] ) and homogeneity of virus distribution in the host country (NiV has predominantly been reported in areas close to rivers such as the Ganges, [27] , and the seroprevalence of Ebola in Gabon is reportedly higher in forest areas as opposed to savannah [64] ). Such in depth analysis could be suited to a country specific case-study and may be advisable to gain a more comprehensive understanding of some of the more specific variation in risk.",

The model design is modular, so is relatively easy to update in light of new data, such as changes in trade patterns, human demographics or spillover of NiV to new competent bat species. Additional routes of entry, such as bat migration, that might be important for new diseases or become more important in the future can also be incorporated. The model is also designed to be adaptable to assess the risk of entry of other infectious organisms given the incorporated underlying global movement and trade of products and people.",
