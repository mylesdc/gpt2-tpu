            "text": "Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000's, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison's Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swineproducing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.",

The University of Minnesota led this initiative starting in 2011, in collaboration with the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), the National Pork Board, and the Swine Health Information Center. Since then, the MSHMP has served as a means to capture the occurrence of infectious diseases for situations in which there is an absence of a regulatory framework [4] . At the time of writing of this manuscript, in December 2017, the program represented a considerable portion of breeding herds in the country (approximately 45%; [5] ) and collected disease incidence data on a weekly basis.",

However, previous research conducted by our research group suggested that PRRS virus transmissibility as captured by the time-dependent reproduction number is incredibly region-and system-dependent [7] , for reasons that could potentially include (but are not limited to) demographic and environmental factors [8, 9] . Even though the swine industry commonly reports PRRS as a seasonal disease, systematic disaggregation of data into regions and systems combined with formal and full assessment and comparison of seasonality PRRS patterns across different US regions has never been published in the peer-reviewed literature. One of the reasons for the lack of such information is that consistent collection of longitudinal disease data over time has been traditionally uncommon for the swine industry in North America. However, after years of data collection, the MSHMP database offered a unique opportunity for conducting, for the first time, temporal analysis such as the one described here.",

In brief, the following steps were taken for construction of models: first, data were decomposed and plotted to visually assess the presence and characteristic of the trend and the seasonality, as well as the autocorrelation (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots. Second, autoregressive moving average modelling was performed, including trend and seasonality terms as covariates. Here, the seasonality was represented by including trigonometric covariates (or Fourier terms). Seasonal cycles of one year and six, four and three months were tested by multivariate linear regression using the least square method [10] . The selection of the most appropriate model for each time series of the study was based on three criteria: assessment of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), statistical significance of the parameters of the model at a reasonable significance level of 0.05, the Box-Pierce test, and the evaluation of the behaviour of the residuals checking its autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function. For series in which the counts contained a considerable number of zeros, a generalized linear autoregressive moving average model with a Poisson structure was also attempted ('glarma' R package; [13] ), with model selection again being prioritized as described above.",

The main finding of this study was that PRRS seasonality varies according to geographical region, and the commonly referred \"PRRS season\" is not necessarily the only time of increase in disease incidence.

Even though it has been reported that cold temperatures (winter season) and low relative humidity favor PRRS virus survival [14] , some factors might help explain these off-winter incidence of PRRS cases. First, during summer months there is larger commingling of animal producers in state fairs or animal shows [15] , which could facilitate disease transmission in the absence of adequate biosecurity practices [16, 17] . Second, lack of awareness of occurrence of other PRRS cases outside the neighborhood and system could contribute to a relaxed attitude towards some biosecurity measures during these months (e.g. less truck washing, drying and disinfecting events), allowing for virus spread [18] . Lastly, considering the volume of activities that occur in the current structure of the swine industry [19] , it is not surprising that there are a lot of opportunities for the pathogens to spread via non-obvious manner such as through feed trucks, fomite and personnel, therefore; even though the virus might be easily transmitted during winter months, the amount of activity is enough for these sporadic events to occur in considerable amounts.",

The period during which this changing point occurred was between May 2013 and late March 2014, which, not surprisingly, coincides with the calendar year in which the U.S. had a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak [21, 22] . It has been previously reported that during 2013-2014, there were significantly fewer PRRS cases for reasons that are still hypothesized [22] . Due to the fact that an unpredictable Table 1 event occurred in the population examined here, our data were not considered robust enough for division into testing and training and potential prediction. Such analysis may be, however, conducted in the future, when enough data would be gathered over the years. Strengths of the study here are the large sample size, the geographic representation of the major pig-producing U.S. states, and the potential impact of the research, given that this is Time-series analysis for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in the United States the disease that cause the most far-reaching impact to the swine industry of the country. Furthermore, data available included over nine years of weekly disease data classified in a standardized manner, which is somewhat rare for an industry-based swine project. ARIMA models were used because they are powerful tools that can be directly fitted using standard packages in R. However the use of families of continuous-time ARMA processes [23] , or Integer-valued AR processes [12] could be also worth exploring in further research.",

However, the most valuable animals in the value chain of the industry were included in the assessment, supporting the importance and impact of the findings. We also acknowledge misclassification bias is possible for the cases in which farms were not correctly classified by the veterinarian as positive shedding. This would be especially a problem for herds that have some kind of underlying immunity (e.g. vaccinated or live-inoculated herds). We realize that, the utilized scheme of classification does not fully detect farms that have low prevalence of animals that are shedding the virus. However, this was the best available method for classifying swine herds in regards to PRRS at the present time, and we the advantage relies on the fact that a standardized method was used throughout the study period, therefore; if this misclassification occurred, it would be consistent across farms, which we believe would dramatically change our conclusions. Finally, emergence of PED at a given point during the study period prevented researchers to develop predictive models at this instance, but the current work will serve as basis for establishing a disease baseline by region, as well as to bring awareness that PRRS is a seasonal disease, and that there may be more than one peak in PRRS cases during the course of an year. Farm and region-level variables were not available to us, but could be collected to investigate potential drivers of the state and system-level differences reported herein.",
