The cause of hepatic failure identified on postmortem exam was herpes simplex virus hepatitis. Design. Observation of a single patient. Setting. Intensive care unit of a tertiary care university teaching hospital in Canada. Patient. 41-year-old previously healthy female presenting with a nonspecific viral illness and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Intervention. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the second day of admission, she was found to have elevated transaminases, and, over 48 hours, she progressed to fulminant liver failure with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, refractory lactic acidosis, and shock. She progressed to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was started on N-acetylcysteine, a bicarbonate infusion, hemodialysis, and multiple vasopressors and inotropes. Measurements and Main Results. Despite treatment, the patient died roughly 70 hours after her initial presentation to hospital. Her postmortem liver biopsy revealed herpes simplex virus hepatitis as her cause of death. Conclusions. Herpes simplex virus must be considered in all patients presenting with liver failure of unknown cause. If suspected, prompt treatment with acyclovir should be initiated.",

Her abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly, and her skin was clear. A pelvic exam was not performed.

The next morning a liver panel was ordered and showed significantly elevated transaminases (AST 4090 U/L, ALT 1692 U/L, ALP 123 U/L, total bilirubin 24 umol/L, INR 2.3, PT 25.9 seconds, PTT 91 seconds, platelets 85 \u00d7 10 9 /L) with signs of liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy but a relatively normal bilirubin. She was now leukopenic with a white blood cell count of 3.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Her acetaminophen level later that day was undetectable. Regardless, she was started on an N-acetylcysteine infusion as treatment for a possible late presentation of acetaminophen toxicity. Her ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening (5 mm) but a negative sonographic Murphy's signs; the portal vein was patent. The imaging was considered consistent with hepatitis. She was initially thought to have liver dysfunction due to prolonged hypotension on presentation resulting in hepatic ischemia. Throughout that day, the patient developed fulminant liver failure with a severe lactic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and required intubation. She was seen by multiple specialists throughout the course of the day and was considered for liver transplant but was deemed unsuitable. No cause for her liver failure was identified. She died later that day after developing vasopressor refractory hypotension, roughly 70 hours after presentation.",

On her postmortem liver biopsy, she had signs of severe acute liver necrosis. There was no evidence of chronic underlying liver disease. All other organ systems were spared. Tissue samples from her liver were sent for multiple tests and were negative for influenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, corona virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Her polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative for cytomegalovirus virus and varicella zoster but positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. Viral culture of her liver sample was positive for HSV type 1. Liver histology revealed diffuse acute liver necrosis with few inflammatory changes ( Figure 1 ). Multiple viral inclusion bodies with the characteristic clear halo distinctive of Cowdry type A inclusions were seen in her hepatocytes ( Figure 2 ). Immunostaining was positive for HSV antibodies ( Figure 3 ). There was no evidence of disseminated HSV. Her cause of death was determined to be herpes simplex viral hepatitis causing fulminant liver failure.",

            "text": "HSV hepatitis presents with nonspecific flu-like symptoms including fever, myalgias, and abdominal pain. Only 30-50% show characteristic herpetic skin lesions [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Laboratory investigations often show leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy [3] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] . Renal failure is not uncommon in these patients [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] , and it has been shown to occur in up to 65% of patients with HSVrelated ALF [3] . Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is frequently reported [5, 8, 9, 15, 16] , and encephalopathy is a late sign of the disease. Ninety percent of patients with HSV hepatitis have a characteristic liver profile, known as \"anicteric hepatitis\" [6, 9, 17, 18] . Anicteric hepatitis refers to a liver profile showing a significant increase in transaminases (100-1000 fold) with a relatively normal or low bilirubin [1, 3, 6, 9, 16] . There may be a marked elevation of AST greater than ALT [6] . Antemortem diagnosis of HSV hepatitis is difficult and is considered in only 23-42% of cases prior to autopsy [3, 15, 19] . Investigations to aid in the diagnosis for HSV hepatitis are limited. Viral serology cultures are extremely sensitive and can be used as a screening tool but are very poorly specific. Viral PCR testing may be useful but is often not rapidly available. Although not always possible due to coagulopathy, the gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy. Cowdry type A inclusions, nuclei with large eosinophilic ground glass-like inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, are pathognomonic for HSV hepatitis [8, 15] . Histology shows extensive areas of hepatocyte necrosis with adjacent congestion but minimal inflammatory infiltrates [20] . Immunohistochemical staining can be done to confirm the diagnosis of HSV, and the presence of viral antigens can be demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining and by identifying monoclonal antibodies against HSV antigens [20] .",
