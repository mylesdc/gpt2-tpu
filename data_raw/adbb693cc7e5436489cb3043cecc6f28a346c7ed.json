Three participants belonging to town households attended the town's nurse-run clinic prior to presenting at a hospital (figure 1). Participants coming from village households tended to shun the clinic, claiming it was too costly relative to the effectiveness of the treatments available there. As all of the cases deemed 'severe' or 'enduring' ultimately ended up presenting to a hospital, shortcomings with facility-based surveillance are therefore likely not a consequence of the health-seeking behaviours of rural populations. Rather, if facility-based surveillance is not working, the dysfunction must be within the healthcare setting.

This limited interaction comprised all of the communication during the consultation for all of the eight case studies. All participants remained unaware of their diagnosis and the nature of the drugs that were prescribed, which is consistent with findings from other studies of Ghanaian clinical settings [8] . This lack of communication was associated with poor doctor-patient relationships and perhaps reflected a low doctor-to-patient ratio (about 22 doctors served a population of approximately 216 481 people in 2013) [9] . For seven of the eight cases, this lack of communication-in particular a tendency for patient records to be maintained but not reviewed-led to doctors unknowingly prescribing treatments that had already been prescribed to, and taken by, the patient following earlier visits to formal healthcare facilities, such as the hospital and town clinic.

No diagnostic tests, including malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which were available at some sites, were employed. This practice of presumptive treatment of fever cases for malaria can be linked to a now superseded set of WHO 2010 guidelines on the treatment of malaria in children.

This had particularly severe repercussions for the rural villagers seeking hospital treatment. The increased associated transport costs the villagers faced and the lower average income and likelihood of NHIS membership meant they had to source money communally for their trip and treatment. This typically limited them to no more than two hospital attendances per episode of illness. Participants from the town experienced fewer financial restrictions than the villagers and were able to pursue hospital treatment across lengthy courses of illness. They typically only ceased hospital care when failure to resolve the illness led them to doubt the efficacy of the biomedical approach. It was often at this point that a participant would engage a professional traditional healer such as a spiritualist. Both the villagers and the townsfolk were largely unaware that many of their hospital visits were redundant.

Healthcare and transport infrastructure are improving, there is a decreasing burden of many common infectious diseases and there are interventions aimed at improving doctorpatient relationships [12, 13] . Many of the recurring problems in identifying early cases of EIDs are not unique to Ghana or West Africa. The diagnosis of a rare condition within the time restrictions of a single episode of illness is problematic in any clinical setting. This difficulty is due primarily to the differential diagnosis process being based on a likelihood model and the uncommon (by definition) nature of EIDs. The processes of identifying and labelling diseases via clinical diagnosis therefore make facility-based surveillance unsuitable as a primary source of EID surveillance. The use of facility-based surveillance for EIDs within the IDSR framework is likely by default rather than by design. The IDSR technical guidelines were originally developed to tackle major burdens of infectious disease and, as such, do not include specific instructions for EID surveillance. This results in the task of EID surveillance being absorbed by the system in place for identifying and controlling common infectious diseases. As the IDSR is the elected vehicle for the revised IHR (2005) in most of Africa, an effective EID surveillance system needs to be developed, especially in environments prone to EIDs.",

Indeed, some novel zoonoses have been found to cause only a single case or a small number of cases before apparently disappearing from the population entirely [14] [15] [16] . Taking a slower approach to detection, one that exceeds the length of an episode of illness, might be a possible solution.

This characteristic, however, is at the expense of the immediate utility promised by facility-based surveillance in containing the threat of an outbreak, a function it may serve in response to larger and more sudden spillover and outbreak events. As such, the introduction of a laboratory-based system for EID detection should not usurp the place of the facility-based system within the IDSR framework but, rather, complement it by providing a more systematic and reliable approach to surveillance. Such a reformed system needs to be targeted at regions, such as Central and West Africa, which are particularly susceptible to zoonotic spillover and therefore likely to see the emergence of a new infectious disease.",

This is not to say that there is not also a need to address the various factors confounding healthcare providers' use of differentials diagnoses in resource-limited settings, which are crucial to the delivery of effective clinical care. However, the success of the One Health approach to EIDs in West Africa is predicated on characterization of accurately diagnosed disease burdens. We must attend, therefore, to the inefficiencies in our dominant approaches to EID surveillance in West Africa or we will be unable to effectively set public health priorities and prevent future disease outbreaks such as the recent Ebola epidemic.",
