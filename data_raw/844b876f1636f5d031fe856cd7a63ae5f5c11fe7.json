Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood.",

In response to the oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure (2 ppm; 3 hours) there were many significant changes in levels of expression of proteins in these groups. Most of the proteins in the redox group were decreased, the proteins involved in protein metabolism increased, and roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases were seen in the defense and immunity group. Responses between WT and KO mice were similar in many respects. However, the percent change was consistently greater in the KO mice and there were more changes that achieved statistical significance in the KO mice, with levels of expression in filtered airexposed KO mice being closer to ozone-exposed WT mice than to filtered air-exposed WT mice.",

These include inflammation, increased airway reactivity, and an increased susceptibility to infection. Ozone exposure has been reported to disrupt epithelial integrity, impair effective phagocytosis, and compromise mucociliary clearance [1] . However, other studies where increased epithelial permeability and changes in ventilation are not observed indicate that these effects may be highly ozone dosedependent [5] . Ozone effects are more pronounced in asthmatics [4] , especially children [3] . Interestingly, ozone-induced inflammation, as measured by neutrophil influx and IL-8 levels, differs between normal subjects and asthmatics, but does not correlate with pulmonary function changes [2] . Differences in the response to ozone among individuals having polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress implicate oxidative stress in these processes and provide a basis for varying susceptibility to ozone-induced symptoms [7] .",

            "text": "Mechanisms involved in ozone-induced lung damage have been investigated in animal models [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In general, experimental animals require significantly higher doses of O 3 exposure than humans [15] to reach comparable amounts of O 3 concentration in the distal lung. Measurement of various parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed that resting rodents exposed to high O 3 doses (2 ppm) were either comparable (polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), protein) or lower (macrophages) than the exercising human exposed to considerably lower O 3 exposures (0.44 ppm). Therefore, it is necessary that rodents be exposed to high O 3 concentrations to better enable extrapolation of findings from animal studies to human. Our laboratory has demonstrated ozone-dependent changes in mice in epithelial permeability, inflammatory mediators, and susceptibility to pneumonia [8, 9, 16] . The changes in epithelial permeability have been attributed to TLR-4-mediated changes in iNOS activity [12] . A role for oxidative stress in ozoneinduced pathophysiology has been postulated based on increases in F 2 -isoprostane [13] , a lipid peroxidation product, as well as reductions in inflammatory mediators and allergen sensitivity by antioxidant treatment [10] . The involvement of oxidative stress is further supported by studies in which genetic polymorphisms influence the response to ozone [17] . Although the pathophysiology of ozone-induced lung damage is incompletely understood, these mechanistic and genetic association studies provide a strong rationale for oxidative stress [7] playing a key role in the response to ozone exposure.",

The basis for these effects is not known, but may relate to the oxidative modification of molecules involved in innate immune processes by reactive oxidant species, lipid peroxidation products, or other molecules generated by oxidative stress. Oxidation of protein molecules can interfere with their function and alter their metabolism by either promoting their degradation or causing the formation of protein aggregates that are not readily degraded [21, 22] .",

            "text": "Surfactant protein-A (SP-A), a major component of BAL, is an example of an innate immune protein whose function is disrupted by oxidation. SP-A is known to play a variety of roles in innate immune function. These include serving as an opsonin for the recognition of some pathogens [23, 24] , regulating the production of cell surface antigens and inflammatory mediator expression by some immune cells [25, 26] , participating in the development of dendritic cells [27] , regulating reactive oxidant production [28, 29] , and others [30] . However, a series of studies from our laboratory has shown that several of these functions are compromised when SP-A is oxidized) [9, [31] [32] [33] [34] . A number of studies have explored the function of SP-A in vivo by subjecting SP-A-/-(SP-A knockout; KO) mice to various infectious or environmental challenges. These include studies of susceptibility to bacterial infection [35, 36] , susceptibility to viral infection [37, 38] , oxidantmediated killing of mycoplasma [39] , response to ozone exposure [8, 16] , and the impact of ozone exposure on susceptibility to pneumonia [16] . These in vivo studies have confirmed the diversity of SP-A's influence on innate immune function. Several studies from our laboratory have explored the role of SP-A in vivo in ozone exposure and innate immunity [8, 9, 16] . We have shown that the response of KO mice to acute ozone exposure, while similar in many respects to that of wild type (WT) mice, has some unique features including the influx of immune cells into the alveolar spaces. KO mice apparently sustain more tissue damage than WT mice, as indicated by BAL lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels detectable immediately after a 3 hr ozone exposure. However, at 4 hr after a 3 hr exposure to ozone lower relative numbers of neutrophils were observed in KO mice than WT mice [8] , in part explaining the differences in lung mRNA levels for MIP-2, and to a lesser degree for MCP-1, between the two strains. Paradoxically however, no differences were observed in MIP-2 and MCP-1 protein levels between the two strains, underscoring, perhaps, the complexity of the processes involved. We have also shown that ozone exposure increases the susceptibility of mice to infection, at least in part due to the oxidation of SP-A [9] , and that KO mice are more susceptible to infection than WT mice [16] .",

In the present study we exposed WT and KO mice to ozone or filtered air and studied the resulting changes in the BAL proteome using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics technique [47-49] for quantitation, coupled with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight/ Time-of-Flight (MALDI-ToF/ToF) tandem mass spectrometry for identification of proteins. These techniques make it possible to simultaneously analyze hundreds of proteins in biological samples and have helped identify both pathways and additional proteins involved in these pathways in various experimental systems [50-52]. We recently employed a similar approach to examine age-related changes in the rat BAL proteome) [53] .

Samples from each group were randomly assigned to Cy3 or Cy5 to ensure no dye-based artifacts in quantitation. Aliquots of 12.5 \u03bcg of BAL protein from each sample were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (200 picomoles). A normalization pool was created by combining equal amounts of protein from every sample (16 samples) and an aliquot of the pool was labeled with Cy2 (200 picomoles). Equal amounts of Cy3-labeled sample, Cy5-labeled sample, and Cy2-labeled pool samples were mixed. The use of a normalization pool is advantageous as this serves as an inter-nal standardization tool for all gels/samples under study, and thus the possibility of erroneous conclusions due to different concentration loads and other related issues is significantly diminished. An equal volume of 2\u00d7 sample buffer (2 M thiourea, 7 M urea, 2% pH 3-10 nonlinear (NL) IPG buffer, 1.2% DeStreak reagent) was added to all samples including the unlabeled preparative gel sample and then brought up to a volume of 450 \u03bcl with rehydration buffer (DeStreak\u2122 Rehydration Solution, 0.5% pH 3-10 NL IPG buffer).

The contributions to the relative variance of the two principal components (42.54% vs 12.76%) indicate that the effect of ozone exposure (principal component 1) on changes in the BAL proteome is greater than that of SP-A deletion (principal component 2). Each of the 16 independent animals (4/ group) represented by the markers in the figure represents the combined weighted average of the first two principal components for each of the 454 protein spots.

The KOFA mice have levels that are similar to the WTO 3 mice but reductions are observed in KOO 3 compared to KOFA or WTO 3 . Panels C through F show examples (including respectively, antithrombin III, pregnancy zone protein, apolipoprotein A-1, and alpha-1-antitrypsin 1-6) of ozone-induced increases in WTO 3 mice that are mirrored by similar or greater increased levels of expression in KOFA mice. The levels of these proteins in KOO 3 mice are further increased to a varying degree compared to WTO 3 or KOFA. Apolipoprotein A-1 has a role in defense and immunity by its ability to bind and neutralize LPS and in redox regulation by its role in neutralizing lipid hydroperoxides and decreasing neutrophil degranulation and superoxide production. Pregnancy zone protein is an antiprotease, but has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity [96] . Antithrombin III and alpha-1antitrypsin 1-6 have antiprotease activity and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activities [62, 64] .",

An arrow indicates whether levels of expression are increased (\u2191) or decreased (\u2193) in response to ozone. The mean values for the normalized volumes for each named protein are given for WTFA, WTO 3 , KOFA, and KOO 3 . The asterisk indicates whether the pvalue for the comparisons of WTFA vs. WTO 3 ; KOFA vs. KOO 3 ; WTFA vs. KOFA; and WTO 3 vs. KOO 3 was \u2264 0.05. Values that were slightly above 0.05 are also given. Representative graphs of specific protein changes significance. A similar situation was observed when we compared WTO 3 to KOO 3 values where values for a given protein followed this progression, but differences were only significant in a few cases. The similarity of expression patterns between WTO 3 mice and KOFA mice supports the possibility that an increase in oxidative stress in KOFA mice exists, perhaps due to the absence of SP-A, an innate immune protein known to have antioxidant activity.",

The mechanism(s) behind these effects are not well understood but may involve proteins in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung that have a role in innate immune mechanisms. One of these proteins, SP-A, is involved in many aspects of innate immunity. A number of studies have described disruptions in SP-A function following exposure to ozone or other oxidants and others have presented evidence indicating that SP-A may have antioxidant function. In several previous studies we have compared the responses of WT and KO mice to ozone exposure and their relative susceptibility to infection after ozone exposure [8, 9, 16] . We found that KO mice sustained greater tissue damage after ozone exposure and were more susceptible to infection. These results indicated that SP-A may play a role in protecting the lung from oxidant-induced injury and from infection. However, the basis for these differences was unclear.",

In order to gain insight into the responsible mechanisms we employed a discovery proteomics approach to characterize changes in the expression of proteins in mouse BAL following ozone exposure and assess the contribution of SP-A to this response by comparing the BAL proteomes of SP-A KO mice and WT mice for the first time and comparing the responses of these two mouse strains to ozone exposure. Using the PANTHER ontology database and the published literature, the proteins identified via MALDI-ToF/ToF MS were assigned to three major functional groups. This broad categorization may provide a more informative overview than the dozens of different biological processes and molecular functions assigned by PANTHER alone. Subsequent analysis compared significant changes among the experimental groups (WTFA, WTO 3 , KOFA, KOO 3 ) and enabled us to postulate an important role for SP-A in response to ozone-induced oxidative stress. This putative role (i.e. its involvement in redox regulation, in addition to its well-described role in innate immunity) builds on several reports that have described an antioxidant function for SP-A [101] [102] [103] .",

            "text": "When we compared the responses of WT and SP-A KO mice to oxidative stress (in the form of an acute ozone exposure), we identified a number of changes in protein expression. These were consistent with oxidative stress and were associated with known complications of ozone exposure, including increased susceptibility to infection in humans [1, 18, 19] and animals [1, 9, 16] . In addition, we observed that the responses to ozone, in terms of percent change, were often more pronounced in KOO 3 compared to WTO 3 mice, indicating that KO mice may be more susceptible to ozone-induced oxidative stress. This observation is consistent with our earlier study in which we reported increased BAL levels of LDH in KO mice, indicating that KO mice sustained more ozone-induced tissue damage than WT mice [8] . Moreover, in a number of cases we found that control KOFA mice expressed many proteins at levels equivalent to, or even exceeding, WTO 3 , indicating that KO mice may be subject to oxidative stress, even in the absence of the exogenous ozone-induced oxidative stress. We speculate that this increase occurs because of the lack of SP-A, an important host defense protein that plays an antioxidant or oxidant scavenger role in the alveolus. This is based on several converging lines of evidence including: 1) the attribution of an antioxidant role to SP-A [101] [102] [103] ; 2) the demonstration that SP-A is highly susceptible to oxidative modification by carbonylation)[53] and to ozone-induced oxidation of methionine residues [34] , and that its function is disrupted by these oxidative modifications) [9, [31] [32] [33] [34] ; and 3) the description of other systems in which proteins serve as \"sacrificial antioxidants\" [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] .",

Interestingly, one of the proteins they found to differ between strains, was peroxiredoxin 6 (identified in their study as antioxidant protein 2) which we found to be significantly reduced after ozone exposure in both strains that we studied. The other protein that differed between strains in their study, Clara cell protein 10, was too small to be resolved in the second dimensional gel system we used. Another study with rats examined the effect of prior ozone exposure on 1-nitronaphthalene adduction of BAL proteins [45] and found peroxiredoxin 6 to be increasingly adducted following ozone exposure. By applying a two-dimensional gel-based discovery proteomics approach to the study of ozone exposure we hoped to obtain additional information about the role of molecules such as peroxiredoxin 6 in this process and to identify previously overlooked molecules that may also play important roles, thereby gaining insight into the interplay of different processes affected by ozone exposure and the resulting pathophysiology. Moreover, the ability (via the use of a normalization pool) in 2D-DIGE to internally standardize the protein spots of all BAL samples in all gels under study provides a major advance that previous BAL studies largely lacked.",

There is precedent for selective changes in susceptibility. Published studies have shown that genetic ablation of SP-A increases the susceptibility of the SP-A KO mouse to organisms whose recognition and clearance are highly dependent on SP-A, such as group B streptococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [35, 36] . On the other hand, increased levels of SP-A can predispose the host to organisms, such as Pneumocystis carinii [113, 114] , that are typically cleared by other mechanisms.

One striking difference between the WT and SP-A KO mice was in the DEF and RED protein groups, where roughly three-fourths of the responses were greater in the KO mice. In most cases the significant ozone-induced changes in the KOO 3 mice were similar to trends observed in the WTO 3 mice, but the magnitude of the change was greater in the KOO 3 mice than in WTO 3 . This is also exemplified by the PCA analysis in which the first principal component, which separated groups by ozone exposure, accounted for a greater degree of study variance (42.54%) than the second component (12.76% of study variance) which segregated KO mice from WT. This indicates both an increased sensitivity to the oxidative stress caused by ozone exposure in both WT and KO, and a more vigorous and perhaps less well-regulated response to the ozone exposure in KO mice.",

In many cases the baseline (FA-exposed) value of the KOFA mice differed from the WTFA values in a similar fashion as the WTO 3 mice differed from the WTFA group. For example, lactate dehydrogenase and sec14-like 3 levels were reduced after ozone exposure and the corresponding levels in the KOFA group were similar to the WTO 3 group. Following ozone exposure, the levels in the KOO 3 mice were further reduced. Similarly, there were a number of cases where increases in WTO 3 mice were mirrored by similar increases in the KOFA mice that were subsequently further increased by ozone as assessed by the values observed in KOO 3 mice. These include apolipoprotein A-I, kininogen 1, and pregnancy zone protein, among others. The similarity between the levels of many proteins in the KOFA mice to those seen in WTO 3 mice (in other words, baseline levels in the KO mice corresponded to levels induced by oxidative stress in the WT mice) led us to propose the following scenario.",

We have demonstrated that SP-A is highly susceptible to oxidative modification and that its modification significantly compromises its function)) [31] [32] [33] 53, [115] [116] [117] . In WT mice SP-A is an abundant BAL protein and several lines of evidence have linked it to redox regulation and led investigators to propose an antioxidant function for SP-A. In these papers it has been demonstrated that SP-A inhibits lipid peroxidation [101, 102, 116] and that it can restore function to oxidized surfactant [103] . We postulate that the reason that many proteins in the KOFA mice have levels similar to WTO 3 mice is because the KOFA mice are under chronic oxidative stress due to the lack of SP-A. In our previous study of ozone exposure and SP-A KO mice we did not detect differences in glutathione levels between WT and KO mice, but we did not measure levels of the many other enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in BAL [118] , nor did we investigate the possible role of compartmentalization of these antioxidants. In addition, although carbonylated protein levels were higher in WTO 3 mice than in KOO 3 , we did not assess levels of other oxidized molecular species, such as lipid peroxidation products, whose formation is known to be inhibited by SP-A [101, 102, 119] . If indeed, SP-A plays an antioxidant role in WT mice by scavenging reactive species under both normal and perturbed conditions as has been previously suggested [120] , its absence in the KO mice may result in increased oxidative stress, even under normal conditions. The findings in the present study support this postulate. Moreover, the lack of SP-A may contribute to an added oxidative stress following O 3 exposure via the reduction in PMN recruitment as shown in this and in a previous study [8] . Thus, based on both similarities and differences in protein levels among the groups under study, it is likely that different and overlapping mechanisms are operative.",

By characterizing these protein expression changes with the broader, unbiased perspective of a \"discovery\" approach we were able to gain insight into a more complete understanding of pathophysiologic changes caused by ozone exposure. For example, the widespread decreases in RED proteins involved in redox balance suggest enhanced turnover of these proteins as a consequence of the oxidative stress resulting from ozone exposure, and the increases in PMM proteins involved in protein metabolism and modification are likely related to this increased turnover. The many changes (both increases and decreases) in proteins in the DEF group provide a possible basis for the increased sus-ceptibility of some individuals to infection following an oxidative stress. Furthermore, the differences described in the response patterns of WT mice and SP-A KO mice provide support for a role of SP-A in innate immunity and redox balance under normal conditions (in the absence of an exogenous oxidative stress) as well as in the presence of an ozone-induced oxidative stress. Thus, based on the present findings, we submit that the sensitivity to oxidative stress in the four conditions we studied here is: KOO 3 \u2265 KOFA \u2248 WTO 3 \u2265 WTFA. Moreover, the susceptibility of SP-A to oxidation shown by previous studies, together with its abundance in BAL fluid, make it ideally suited to play a role as a \"sacrificial antioxidant,\" as has been described for albumin [104, 105, 109] and postulated for other proteins [107] . Further study is warranted to investigate the postulated mechanisms in greater detail.",
