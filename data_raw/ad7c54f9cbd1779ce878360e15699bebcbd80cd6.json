The RV genome is composed of 11 double stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which code for 6 structural (VP1 through 4, 6 and 7) and 6 non-structural (NSP1 through NSP6) proteins. Seven classified RV groups (A-G) are recognized, based on the antigenic variability of their inner capsid protein, VP6. VP4 and VP7 (the outer capsid proteins) possess epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody responses and in turn determine RV serotypes. Estes [5] developed a dual classification system by defining VP7-specific serotypes, termed G-types (glycoprotein) and VP4 specific serotypes termed P-types (protease sensitive protein). Genotypic classification of all RV strains is now based on this system. Based on the comparative analysis of these genes, currently there are 15 VP7 genotypes (G-types 1 through 15) and 27 VP4 genotypes (P-types ) recognized among human and animal group A rotavirus. To date, six P-types (P6 [1] , P7 [5] , P8 [11] , P11 [14] , P [17] and P [21] ) and 8 G-types (G1, G3, G5, G6, G7, G8, G10 and G15) have been reported among bovine RV-group A [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of RV in a giraffe. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the GirRV strain was closely related to bovine RV strains. There is limited information on the prevalence of RV in zoo environments and exotic species. In 1978, Eugster and colleagues described the clinical and laboratory findings of an outbreak of pneumoenteric disease in a zoo nursery [29] . This was the first study of its kind to report a RV-associated infection in zoo animals. More recent studies identified RV in a variety of exotic species in their natural habitats and zoo nurseries [30] [31] [32] [33] . Petric and colleagues [30] identified a wide range of animals that were sero-positive for RV in zoo environments. In Peru, Rivera et al., [31] examined sera from alpacas (Lama pacos) Evolutionary relationships of 23 VP7 proteins Figure 5 Evolutionary relationships of 23 VP7 proteins. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [25] , implemented in MEGA4 [26] . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [27] . Branches with less than 80% bootstrap support have been collapsed. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method [28] and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 293 positions in the final dataset. The Giraffe sequence is identified with the arrow as shown in the figure.",

Group A RV with a G8 genotype was identified. Phylogenetic analysis of these RV strains, showed a close relationship to other G8 bovine RV previously reported in Japan, the USA and Switzerland.

The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [27] . Branches with less than 80% bootstrap support have been collapsed. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method [28] and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 229 positions in the final dataset. The Giraffe sequence is identified with the arrow as shown in the figure.",
