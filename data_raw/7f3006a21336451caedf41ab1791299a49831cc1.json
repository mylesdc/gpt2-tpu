The intricate interplay between viral exploitation of cellular pathways and the intrinsic host defense mechanisms is difficult to unravel by traditional bulk approaches. In recent years, novel fluorescence microscopy techniques and single virus tracking have transformed the investigation of dynamic virus-host interactions. A prerequisite for the application of these imaging-based methods is the attachment of a fluorescent label to the structure of interest. However, their small size, limited coding capacity and multifunctional proteins render viruses particularly challenging targets for fluorescent labeling approaches. Click chemistry in conjunction with genetic code expansion provides virologists with a novel toolbox for site-specific, minimally invasive labeling of virion components, whose potential has just recently begun to be exploited. Here, we summarize recent achievements, current developments and future challenges for the labeling of viral nucleic acids, proteins, glycoproteins or lipids using click chemistry in order to study dynamic processes in virus-cell interactions.

Outside of their host, they exist as (largely) inert macromolecular assemblies, which awaken to a \"borrowed life\" upon entry into a suitable host cell. A virus particle, or virion (Figure 1a) , essentially consists of genomic information enclosed in a protective protein shell (capsid). In some cases (\"enveloped viruses\"), the capsid is further surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell. Although viruses may additionally encode enzymes or accessory proteins to promote their replication and spread, they lack the autonomous machineries required for protein synthesis and metabolism. Therefore, viruses represent obligatory pathogens which can only replicate by usurping metabolic resources, trafficking pathways and enzymatic machineries of their host. This exploitation of cellular functions, as well as cellular defense strategies directed against the invading pathogen, involves numerous dynamic, complex, and highly regulated interactions between viral and cellular components. Understanding the intricate interactions between a virus and its host cell is not only highly relevant for identifying weaknesses of pathogenic Receptor mediated attachment (i) is followed by cytosolic entry (ii), which may occur via an endocytotic process or-for enveloped viruses-membrane fusion. An uncoating step (iii) releases the viral genome, which is replicated (iv) either in the cytosol or in the nucleus of the host cell. Viral proteins are produced by the host cell translation machinery (v). Finally, newly synthesized virion components assemble into progeny particles (vi); this may occur either within the cell or directly underneath the plasma membrane.

Laser scanning confocal microscopy and spinning disc confocal microscopy enable the 3D tracking of objects over time with high temporal resolution; total internal reflection microscopy focuses on events occurring at the plasma membrane; and light sheet microscopy makes it possible to image viral spread in tissue samples or organoids [1, 2] . In recent years, super-resolution microscopy like structured illumination microscopy (SIM), single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques such as PALM/(d)STORM and stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy have lowered the effective resolution of fluorescence microscopy to the level of subviral structures [2, 3] , and thereby, greatly expanded the possibilities for detailed investigation of virus-cell interactions (for a recent in-depth review on these methods see [4] ). Initially, nanoscopic techniques were mainly restricted to 2D analysis of fixed samples in one or a few color channels, but rapid technological development in this field has already begun to overcome these limitations, and substantial progress can be expected in the coming years. In addition, increasing the throughput of advanced imaging data acquisition and growing information density requires sophisticated analysis pipelines for objective and quantitative analyses of imaging data, computational modeling of structures derived from SRFM (e.g., [5] ), and 4D tracking of the complex mobility of individual virus particles in noisy live-cell imaging sequences (reviewed in [1, 6] ).",

For the labeling of proteins, the genetically encoded marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the constantly expanding panel of engineered fluorescent proteins (FPs) [7] have been, and still are, invaluable tools for the investigation of dynamic events in cell biology. However, besides their relatively high molecular mass of~27 kDa, FPs have clear limitations regarding the use of advanced light microscopic methods and the study of viruses in general [8] . Advanced fluorescence microscopy methods have specific requirements regarding the photophysical properties of the fluorophore, which are often not met by FPs. Single virus tracking within an infected cell requires high fluorescence intensity of the label for sensitive and quantitative detection of individual particles, and high photostability of the dye to allow for the acquisition of image sequences with high temporal resolution. Furthermore, the relatively slow maturation of the fluorophore characteristic for most fluorescent proteins prevents the observation of tagged proteins shortly after translation, and pH-dependent quenching may obscure signals in the endosomal compartment. STED and PALM/STORM rely on fluorophores that can switch between an 'on' and 'off' state, and the high laser intensities required for emission depletion in standard STED microscopy again requires highly photostable labels. All these requirements are fulfilled by synthetic dyes, which also provide a large variation of excitation/emission maxima for multi-color imaging, including dyes in the far-red range.",

Stainable genetically encoded tags, e.g., SNAP-, Halo-, TMP-or FAST-tag [9] allow the attachment of synthetic fluorophores to a protein of interest (POI). However, the molecular dimensions of these tags are not negligible compared to the size of the POI. While this is a general concern for any POI to be tagged, viral proteins are particularly challenging targets for genetic modification. Many viruses are characterized by small genomes with overlapping open reading frames and increasing the genome size may affect its packaging into the viral capsid. Viral structural proteins are typically small and multifunctional, and they need to assemble into regular and stable multimeric structures.

However, in this case labeling is not restricted to a specific site, and its degree is difficult to control. The incorporation of a functionalized non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) into the POI via genetic code expansion (GCE), followed by the attachment of a synthetic fluorophore via a fast and specific bioorthogonal click reaction represents the most minimally invasive strategy for site-specific protein labeling [10] [11] [12] . The methodology had been originally established in bacteria. Its more recent adaptation to eukaryotic cells provides virologists with novel opportunities for site-specific introduction of a fluorophore of choice into their viral POI ( Figure 2 ). While conceptually ideal for virus labeling, the approach still remains technically challenging, and its full potential for virus imaging has not yet been realized. Very recently, however, its application has begun to transcend from proof of principle studies to analyses yielding exciting new insights into virus biology. The modification of viral proteins with clickable groups and GCE also provides new options to target viral vectors to specific cell types, to engineer attenuated antiviral vaccines, to photoactivate virus functions, to immobilize viruses for physical measurements, or to mimic post-translational modifications.

The first example of labeling of the non-enveloped capsid of adenovirus (AdV) via click chemistry was accomplished for human adenovirus 5, targeting the sugar moiety of the fiber protein. The fibers form spikes associated with each penton base of the icosahedral capsid shell and carry a single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on a serine residue. Banerjee et al. [13] replaced this natural sugar with azido derivatives such as tetraacetylated N-azidoacetyl-glucosamine or -galactosamine (Ac4GlcNAz, Ac4GalNAz) through metabolic incorporation. Subsequent copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) mediated ligation to alkyne-coupled fluorophores or peptides demonstrated that AdV particles can be decorated with different functional groups through this sugar moiety without affecting virus production or infectivity. The resulting engineered virions were not used for imaging studies, but were decorated with molecules that mediate retargeting of the virus to a desired host cell type [13] .",

The envelope is derived from a host cell membrane; however, its lipid composition can differ from the parental membrane, since viruses target or create specific membrane microenvironments to promote virus assembly and budding. Membrane composition may also determine the fusion properties of the particle in the viral entry process. Lipid-binding proteins tagged with FPs and fluorescently labeled lipid derivatives have been employed to analyze the distribution of lipids in membranes at the nanoscale, but both manipulations may significantly influence the properties of the lipid under investigation. Metabolic labeling using clickable mimetics of lipids or lipid precursors [20] provides an elegant solution increasingly used in cell biology, but not yet really exploited in virology. Proof of concept was provided by introducing azide-choline into the membrane of vaccinia and influenza virus and demonstrating that the viral particles could be click labeled via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) [21] .",

However, this method is neither protein-nor site-specific, defying the purpose of minimally invasive, virus specific labeling. It also does not allow precise positioning of labels for single-molecule approaches. Recent studies have therefore explored the technically more challenging approach of GCE for incorporation of single modified amino acid residues. ",

The second step comprises the click labeling reaction, which results in the covalent ligation of proteins with synthetic fluorophores or other molecules of choice (Figure 3b-d) . To apply this method to the modification of a viral POI, the codon at the position of choice needs to be replaced by an alternative codon that specifies the ncAA. In addition, a bioorthogonal tRNA recognizing this codon and a cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) to charge the tRNA with the ncAA have to be expressed in the virus producing cell. The most widely used GCE approaches To apply this method to the modification of a viral POI, the codon at the position of choice needs to be replaced by an alternative codon that specifies the ncAA. In addition, a bioorthogonal tRNA recognizing this codon and a cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) to charge the tRNA with the ncAA have to be expressed in the virus producing cell. The most widely used GCE approaches employ a natural stop codon to represent the ncAA [10] [11] [12] . While all three nonsense codons were successfully used for the incorporation of ncAAs, the amber stop codon (UAG) is preferred over ochre (UAA) and opal (UGA), due to its lower abundance in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNAs. The method is therefore referred to as 'amber suppression'. Amber stop codons are recognized and decoded as the 22nd amino acid pyrrolysine (Pyl) [23] in certain methanogenic archaea, which have served as the basis for developing suitable orthogonal tRNAPyl/aaRSPyl pairs that mediate specific incorporation of the ncAA of choice. The most commonly used tRNAPyl/aaRSPyl pairs are adapted from the archaea Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina barkeri [10] [11] [12] . In practice, the gene of interest is mutated in the viral context, or in the context of a separately expressed viral protein, introducing a TAG stop codon at a position of choice. The modified virus or viral protein is then produced in cells that express the components of the suppression system (usually accomplished via transient transfection with expression constructs encoding the orthogonal tRNA/aaRS pair) in the presence of a ncAA added to the growth medium at high concentration (up to 1 mM). Successful amber suppression results in production of the full-length POI with a click-reactive chemical handle at the desired position (Figure 3e) .",

Depending on the biological question to be addressed, this reaction will be performed either directly in the virus (or viral protein) producing cell, or upon purification of the engineered virions from the tissue culture supernatant. The chemical nature of both, the ncAA and the conjugated molecule has to be tailored to the planned application. More than 100 ncAAs with different sizes and different reactive groups have been described (examples in Figure 3a ) [10] . Derivatives carrying the small linear alkyne group react efficiently with molecules functionalized with an azide group via CuAAC. This well established and efficient reaction has the disadvantage that the Cu(I) required for catalysis is highly toxic for bacterial and eukaryotic cells, limiting the technique to fixed samples. Copper-independent alternatives employ ncAAs carrying strained alkynes or alkenes such as cyclooctyne or trans-cyclooctene, which are highly reactive under live-cell conditions. Strained alkynes can react both with azide-or tetrazine-coupled organic fluorophores in a strain-promoted Huisgen-type 1,3 dipolar [3 + 2]-cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction or strain-promoted inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction (SPIEDAC), respectively, whereas strained alkenes react only with tetrazines via SPIEDAC reaction (Figure 3b ). Cyclooctyne and trans-cyclooctene carrying ncAAs can thus be orthogonal to each other. The SPAAC reaction is slow, with rate constants in the range of 0.1-1 M \u22121 s \u22121 whereas SPIEDAC reactions occur with rates of 10 2 -10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 , promoting rapid labeling reactions.",

The sensitive detection of viruses requires bright and photostable dyes, and special applications may introduce further constraints. Depending on the viral POI, SVT approaches may require cell or membrane permeable dyes; it may also be necessary to use a fluorogenic probe to reduce cellular background. Advanced super-resolution microscopy approaches as PALM/STORM or STED require blinking, photoswitchable or extremely photostable fluorophores [2, 3] .

Their apparent lack of pathogenicity and their ability to infect dividing and non-dividing cells, resulting in persistent gene expression, render AAV-derived viral delivery vectors particularly attractive candidate vehicles for gene therapy. A detailed characterization of AAV-host cell interactions in the early phases of the replication cycle is important to understand the process of gene transduction by AAVs and for development of improved AAV-based vectors. The labeling of AAV for imaging analyses of viral entry has been approached by fusion of eGFP to VP2, one of the three capsid proteins of AAV [25] , or by carbodiimide coupling of quantum dots to reactive cysteines and lysines on the viral surface [26] . However, these strategies can affect virus infectivity, and the addition of quantum dots nearly doubles the hydrodynamic radius of the virion [26] . Proof of principle for minimally-invasive labeling of AAV was provided by Kelemen et al. [27] , who showed that a region present in all three capsid proteins (VP1-3) of AAV2 can be engineered to incorporate an azido-lysine (AzK) residue without affecting virus infectivity. The resulting virus particles carried 60 reactive ncAA, which could be ligated via SPAAC to a strained alkyne-fluorophore conjugate; the virus was not used for imaging purposes in this study, however. Recently, Zhang et al. [28] identified positions in the VP1 of AAV2 that tolerate the incorporation of N\u03b5-2-azideoethyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (NAEK) ( Figure 3a ) and click labeling, and used the resulting viral particles in imaging experiments. Entering virions could be tracked through the endosomal pathway, and impaired transport of particles to the nucleus upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin B was visualized [28] .",

The first example of envelope glycoprotein labeling via metabolic incorporation of clickable sugars was presented for the measles virus (MV), a (\u2212)strand RNA virus belonging to the family of Paramyxoviridae [29] . The surface of the virion is decorated with hemagglutinin (HA), which mediates cell attachment, and with the viral fusion protein FP. Zhao et al. showed that N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4ManNAz) and Ac4GalNAz can be metabolically incorporated into HA and FP and subsequently be click-labeled with alkyne-coupled fluorophores via SPAAC (Figure 4a ) [29] . Although the labeled particles were not used to investigate the virus entry process, this study set the stage for the metabolic labeling of enveloped viruses. Oum et al. [30] adapted the strategy to the highly-glycosylated envelope (Env) protein of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Double-labeled particles were prepared by combining mCherry as a viral content marker with click labeling of Ac4ManNAz incorporated into the Env glycoprotein in order to differentiate intact virions from subviral particles that had undergone membrane fusion.

However, it is neither protein-nor site-specific, and can only be applied to glycoproteins. Therefore, the site-specific introduction of ncAA into envelope proteins by GCE has gained increasing interest in recent years. The first proof of concept came for the hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a satellite virus of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a major human pathogen. HDV is a small (~35 nm) spherical enveloped virusoid. Its circular ssRNA genome is the smallest mammalian virus genome (~1.7 kb). For replication, HDV depends on co-infection of the cell with HBV, whose large envelope protein (L-protein) is usurped by HDV to package its genome. Lin et al. [34] were able to incorporate several ncAAs with differing functionalities site-specifically into the HBV L-protein to produce engineered HDV particles. When the ncAA was introduced at a suitable position, particle yield and infectivity was comparable to wild-type HDV. Fluorophores or biotin molecules were clicked to the surface of engineered HDV by CuAAC [34] , but the particles were not used for further biological studies.",

Das et al. [33] were interested in the conformational dynamics of the IAV HA protein, which is mechanistically relevant for promoting virus-cell fusion. In order to monitor the conformational state of the molecule in real time, they developed a single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-based approach to distinguish between the pre-and post-fusion conformation of the HA molecule. Pushing the current limits of the GCE technology, the authors simultaneously incorporated two TCOK* residues at strategic positions within the HA protein of IAV. SPIEDAC mediated click labeling with a FRET pair of different dyes (Cy3-and Cy5-tetrazine) yielded a high FRET signal for HA in the pre-fusion conformation, which was lost when the protein assumed its coiled-coil post fusion conformation ( Figure 4d ) [33] . Probing HA conformation under different conditions, the authors could show that the molecules are highly dynamic, reversibly interconverting between three distinct conformational states. Acidification (as it occurs during endosomal entry of the virus) and receptor binding shifted the conformational equilibrium, and additional membrane contact triggered irreversible conversion to the post-fusion state [33] . In this case, the exploitation of GCE/click labeling, combined with single-molecule imaging, yielded biological information that could not have been obtained by any other approach.",

The criteria that define sites permissive for amber suppression using various tRNA/aaRS pairs have been identified in bacteria [35] , but such information is currently lacking for eukaryotic cells. Thus, multiple positions within the POI need to be explored. In the case of viruses, the introduced modification should ideally provide high particle yields and have no effect on virus infectivity. Impairment of replication competence might influence the process being studied, and lower virus titers limit downstream applications. Additional restrictions may limit the options in the case of viral structural proteins, whose multifunctional nature renders them generally intolerant towards genetic modifications. This fragility may even manifest itself upon minimally-invasive modification by a single click-labeled ncAA. For example, a comprehensive mutational analysis (introducing natural amino acids) of the notoriously genetically fragile CA protein of HIV-1 revealed that~70% of point mutations tested severely impaired or abolished viral infectivity [36] .

Viral capsids are multimers of structural proteins; depending on the virus, they may comprise many monomers of a given protein (e.g.,~1500 CA molecules per HIV-1 capsid). AAV, a small virus whose capsid is formed from only 60 monomers, could be successfully detected in infected cells upon GCE/click labeling [28] . This exemplifies the possibility of imaging very small viruses with a low number of capsomers, at least upon in vitro click labeling of purified particles. Click-labeled HIV-1 Env on viral particles, where only 21-45 molecules are present per virion, was below the limit of microscopic detection, while the protein could be readily visualized at the surface of producer cells [32] . In principle, sensitivity may be increased by including more than one label per POI, but it needs to be kept in mind that each additional position targeted by GCE/click labeling makes the system less efficient and increases the invasiveness of the approach.",

First, virus production generally relies on high protein yields, with a balanced stoichiometry between different virion components. Inefficient amber suppression may thus result in deficient particle formation by reducing the intracellular concentration of a structural protein below a critical value or by skewing the balance between different building blocks of the viral particle.

In contrast, the application of GCE/click labeling to analyses of later stages of the replication cycle requires labeling of viral proteins within the virus-producing cell, which is considerably more difficult. In this case, studies should ideally be performed on cell types that closely mimic the natural host cell of the respective virus, preferably primary cells, which are often refractory to transfection and much more challenging to manipulate.

With their large coding capacity and ability to efficiently transduce different cell types (e.g., primary cells including mouse embryonic fibroblasts and rat cardiac fibroblasts, cultured neurons, as well as mouse embryonic stem cells), baculoviral vectors are a particularly attractive possibility for experiments in tissue culture with cell types which are difficult to manipulate [45] .",

Although the strategy is surprisingly well tolerated by cells in principle, it is bound to have pleiotropic and toxic effects, particularly when suppression efficiency is high. Moreover, amber suppression and click labeling of host cell proteins will lead to increased background labeling. Both cytotoxicity and background labeling may hamper the application of GCE and click labeling for the study of intracellularly labeled viral proteins by affecting the viral replication cycle and impairing sensitive detection of viral structures, respectively. Since the production of viruses in tissue culture is completed within a few hours to a few days post transfection, and the state of the producing cells should not affect the experimental outcome upon infection of untreated target cells, these considerations are less relevant when engineered viruses are used in analyses of the early replication steps.",

The use of purified engineered viruses for the infection of native target cells circumvents potential toxic effects of the GCE procedure on the host cell. This advantage does, however, not apply to investigations of the late phase of viral replication cycles, where proteins need to be engineered, labeled and analyzed in the producer cell. Furthermore, viral genomes are often small and readily manipulated using standard molecular biology methods. Thus, non-targeted amber stop codons of viral genes might be converted to ochre or opal codons to avoid recognition by the GCE system. Since small genomes are frequently characterized by overlapping open reading frames or the coincidence of genes with regulatory nucleic acid sequences, the effect of such alterations on infectivity needs to be tested. Of particular interest for future studies is the orthogonal incorporation of two different ncAA carrying two different fluorophores or other functional groups, to allow, for example, for smFRET analyses.

Unlike eukaryotic cells with a default dsDNA genome, viruses store their genomic information in different forms: RNA or DNA, single or double stranded, segmented or as a single molecule. While dsDNA viruses have the ability to rely on the host cell machinery for genome replication, all other viruses have developed specific replication strategies, as well as strategies to convert genomic information into mRNA encoding viral proteins. Viruses can be classified according to their replication and transcription strategy (\"Baltimore scheme\" [19] ).

It should be noted that nucleotide analogs are substrates for cellular polymerases and other metabolic enzymes, and thus may exhibit cytotoxic effects upon prolonged incubation. Induction of cell cycle arrest, necrosis and general genome instability have indeed been described for the widelyused compound EdU, with IC50 values in the 1-10 \u00b5 M range determined for different cell lines upon 72 h incubation [64] . This prompted the development of less toxic derivatives. F-ara-EdU, an EdU derivative with deoxyribose replaced by a D-arabinosyl (2\u2032S) configuration with a fluorine substituent at the 2\u2032-position, exhibited several orders of magnitude higher IC50 values in tissue culture compared to EdU [64] . The derivative EdC also has been described to be less toxic than EdU when incubated together with thymidine, which suggests that metabolic pyrimidine pathways may be partly responsible for cytotoxicity [61] . Based on this assumption, the purine nucleoside EdA was developed, which displayed ~ 10 fold higher IC50 values than EdU in tissue culture. In contrast to EdU, the IC50 value of EdA did not change dramatically upon prolonged incubation, indicating a nongenotoxic mode of action [62] . Many virological experiments are completed on a short time scale, where such cytotoxic effects may not be manifest.

Initial studies employing alkyne modified clickable nucleosides thus focused on HSV-1 [65] , which carries a comparatively large dsDNA genome of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 bp and forms distinct replication compartments within the nucleus. Replication compartments of AdV (3.6 \u00d7 10 4 bp) were also detected by click-based approaches [65] .

Comparative analyses of HSV-1, AdV and the poxvirus vaccinia revealed differences in nucleoside analog preferences. While EdU, the slightly less toxic derivative F-ara-EdU, EdA and EdC could all be incorporated into the AdV genome, signals for vaccinia virus were only detectable using EdU (and less efficiently with EdC). In contrast, EdA and EdC yielded the strongest signals in the case of HSV-1, with F-ara-EdU being slightly weaker [65] . These pronounced differences might not only be explained by the different selectivities of the respective viral DNA polymerases, but may also result from differential nucleoside phosphorylation efficiencies within the specific host cell types. Furthermore, many viruses encode nucleoside or nucleotide modifying enzymes that either alter (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphate levels (e.g., HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK), which catalyzes monophosphorylation, or dUTPase, which hydrolizes dUTP), or modify DNA after replication (e.g., uracil DNA glycosylases (UNG) that cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of misincorporated dUMP from DNA).",

The data obtained using single virus imaging corroborated results from ensemble measurements, and provided novel insights into HSV-1 replication as well as dsDNA viral biology in general. After HSV-1 fuses with the host cell membrane, the capsid is transported to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), where uncoating of the viral capsid and nuclear transport of the dsDNA genome occurs. Within the nucleus, HSV-1 creates replication compartments (RC) that provide an ideal environment to synthesize large amounts of progeny DNA, transcribe mRNA to produce viral proteins, and assemble newly-formed capsids with viral dsDNA. RC are often found adjacent to nuclear organizing structures, one of them being PML nuclear bodies (PML-NB) that are implicated in the cellular defense against viruses.",

[70] reasoned that the activity of the viral dUTPase and UNG enzymes may limit EdU incorporation. Knock-out of both genes in the HSV-1 genome indeed resulted in higher labeling efficiency of viral particles. The presence of the bioorthogonal handle on the viral DNA enabled the authors to attach different functionalities in order to complement biochemical analysis and imaging [70] . Cells were infected with EdU-carrying particles, and viral DNA was pulled down upon click coupling to biotin-azide. Mass spectrometric analysis of viral DNA-associated proteins revealed over 200 cellular and viral proteins (e.g., transcription factors, cellular DNA replication and repair machinery, RNA processing proteins and chromatin remodeling factors) selectively recruited to HSV-1 RCs. Intriguingly, abundant chromatin remodeling complexes, but no histones, were detected in these experiments. The underrepresentation of histones at viral replication sites was confirmed by imaging of click-labeled particles, indicating that HSV-1 DNA is not extensively chromatinized during replication [70] . In a follow-up study, the authors expanded on these findings by utilizing a similar strategy, but limiting an EdC pulse to 5-20 min; this enabled the selective incorporation of EdC into active HSV-1 replication forks. Different pulse times, together with pulse-chase experiments, revealed the dynamic binding of DNA repair proteins and transcription factors to the viral replication fork, and indicated the coupling of those processes to DNA replication [71] . Again, the results were confirmed by imaging upon clicking a fluorophore to incorporated EdC and observing colocalization of selected factors with HSV-1 RC [71] . Interestingly, nascent DNA moved outwards, indicating the existence of functionally-separated subdomains within the viral RC.",

Cells were infected with particles carrying EdC incorporated into the viral genome, followed by click labeling of the entering particles with a functionalized Alexa dye. Strikingly, the viral DNA was only occasionally detected inside the cytoplasm of infected cells, while nuclear signals where readily detectable (Figure 6a ). The differential labeling suggested that the DNA contained in the viral capsid was inaccessible to the fluorophore, while DNA ejected in the nucleus after viral uncoating at the NPC could be readily chemically modified. This assumption was confirmed by comparing staining of native virions with particles that had undergone in vitro induced uncoating [72] . Thus, in the case of HSV-1, the bioorthogonal DNA labeling strategy not only serves to detect genomes, but can also report on the state of the viral capsid. [73] .

            "text": "Foreign DNA within the cytoplasm rapidly triggers innate immune responses leading to interferon (IFN) production [49] . Protection of the incoming HSV-1 genome by the viral capsid mediates evasion from antiviral defenses until the particle reaches the nucleus. The uncoating step occurring at this site is accompanied by DNA decondensation, rendering the genome accessible for click labeling [72] . Since the DNA now also becomes accessible to innate immune sensors, e.g., the IFN\u03b3 Inducible Protein 16 (IFI16) or PML-NB, HSV-1 antagonizes these antiviral proteins by proteasomal degradation. Using EdU labeled HSV-1 particles that carried a knock-out of the respective antagonizing protein (ICP0-null mutant), Alandijany et al. [75] intriguingly observed rapid entrapment of HSV-1 genomes by PML-NB upon nuclear import. The authors elegantly demonstrated that the presence of incoming HSV-1 DNA within PML-NB by itself was not sufficient to induce a cellular IFN response, and IFI16 was not observed to colocalize with HSV-1 DNA at early time points [75] . A complementary study that amplified the IFI16 IF signal by a proximity ligation assay (PLA) with two different antibodies revealed that only very low levels of IFI16 localized to incoming genomes [76] . Most importantly, the saturation of IFI16, which is necessary to elicit a robust IFN response, only occurred after the replication of viral DNA [75] . These findings elucidated an elaborate dual strategy of the host cell to counteract HSV-1: the incoming viral genomes are entrapped to prevent replication; failure to prevent viral DNA replication results in shift to an antiviral state in order to curtail further viral spread. Of note, these studies were only made possible by the high sensitivity of the EdU click labeling strategy, which enabled researchers to analyze individual incoming particles under low multiplicity of infection (MOI) experimental conditions. The low expression levels of intrinsic host nucleic acid sensors can be rapidly saturated by infection at high MOI [75] , which previously obscured the kinetics and temporal intricacies of the recruitment process.",

Strikingly, HSV-1 infection with a very low MOI coincident with EdC pulse incorporation and click labeling of cellular DNA revealed that while HSV-1 infection blocks cellular DNA replication at the G1/S phase transition in the infected cells, cellular DNA synthesis was drastically enhanced in uninfected bystander cells [77] . This was attributed to a (yet to be identified) paracrine effector, which was stimulated by HSV-1 infection, and may prime neighboring cells for subsequent infection [77] . Another creative use of metabolic labeling and click chemistry took advantage of the fact that HSV-1 encodes its own thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK), which is characterized by a more promiscuous substrate range compared to cellular TK. Due to selective phosphorylation by the viral enzyme, 2 -deoxy-2 ,2 -difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (dF-EdU) is only incorporated into DNA in HSV-1 infected cells, and thus serves as a bioorthogonal marker for viral infection [78] .",

In humans, AdV may cause various types of infections (eye, respiratory or gastrointestinal tract). They enter the cell via endocytosis. After escape from the endosome by activation of the viral membranolytic protein VI, particles traffic to the NPC, where the genome is released into the nucleus. Cell free particles carrying alkyne-modified genomes were refractory to click labeling. In contrast, signals were readily detected for the majority (~75%) of entering capsid positive complexes in the cytosol at 30 min post infection (when particles are assumed to be released from the endosome), indicating partial uncoating [65] . At 3 h post infection, only one third of capsid-containing viral particles remained associated with the viral DNA, indicating genome release. Of note, this detectable uncoating was completely blocked by leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export that also blocks docking of AdV particles to the NPC [65] .",

Besides other factors, the authors identified proteins that are important in the regulation of the cell cycle and mitosis. EdU click-labeling of viral genomes confirmed the dependence of HPV infection on nuclear envelope breakdown [81] . Of note, the authors initially used BrdU for the detection of viral genomes, but switched to EdU, because the detection via CuAAC was more sensitive. In a follow-up study, Broniarczyk et al. [82] analyzed the time required for HPV nuclear penetration. In cells synchronized in G2/M, EdU positive viral genomes associated with PML-NB inside the nucleus within only 1 h post infection, much faster than previously thought.

            "text": "Since HPV particles lose a major part of the capsid during endocytic trafficking [79] , it remained unclear how HPV protected its genome from cytosolic antiviral defenses during trafficking from the TGN to the nucleus. DiGiuseppe et al. [74] used a sequential double click strategy of EdU tagged incoming viral genomes to determine that the HPV genome is found within a protective vesicle throughout the whole process of mitosis. They first partially permeabilized the plasma membrane and early endosomes using low digitonin concentrations, followed by click labeling with the membrane impermeable Alexa Fluor 550 (AF550)-azide dye. Subsequently, samples were fully permeabilized followed by click labeling with AF647-azide to visualize previously protected genomes. Only after mitosis and reformation of the nuclear envelope, EdU-labeled viral genomes became accessible to partial permeabilization, resulting in AF550 and AF647 double-labeled signals (Figure 6c ) [74] . Validating their findings by careful controls and biochemical experiments, the authors thus uncovered a novel vesicular transport mechanism of cargo into the nucleus during mitosis. Vesicles can apparently exist for some time within the nucleus. While the origin of the vesicles remains to be established, the authors speculated that HPV hijacks vesicles during the fragmentation of ER and TGN in mitosis [74] .",

Depending on the virus and the host cell type, a significant proportion, or even the vast majority, of particles entering a cell may end up in non-productive pathways, e.g., endosomal degradation. In the case of HIV-1, the detection of nascent reverse transcription products by EdU incorporation and click labeling has been employed to identify particles undergoing productive reverse transcription [68] . Since retroviruses perform DNA synthesis outside of the nucleus, and at least lentiviruses such as HIV-1 are able to infect non-dividing cells that do not undergo de novo cellular DNA synthesis, the sensitivity of the metabolic labeling procedure was sufficient to detect individual HIV-1 reverse transcription products (<10 kb) within subviral complexes. Although the detection of viral DNA by itself does not prove the infectivity of a given particle, it demonstrates that the respective particle is capable of reverse transcription. Furthermore, while it is not quantitative, the degree of labeling provides an estimate for the progression of the reverse transcription process.",

The authors identified delayed reverse transcription, caused by the depletion of the available dNTP pool by the host restriction factor SAM and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), as the main bottleneck responsible for the slow replication of the virus in this host cell type [67] . Quantification of EdU/click signals associated with particles at different intracellular localizations revealed higher signals on nuclear complexes compared to cytosolic particles, and in particular, to those detected near the nuclear envelope. This observation led to the hypothesis that reverse transcription may enhance the efficiency of nuclear entry and/or that-contrary to the current belief-HIV-1 reverse transcription may only be completed after nuclear import in this cell type [67] .",

A combination of RNA click labeling with a correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approach to compare the ultrastructure of RNA positive vs. negative replication compartments would be of great interest. The gradual development of viral factories has also been observed for coronaviruses (CoV). This virus family, which comprises pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in humans, is characterized by the largest known viral RNA genomes (up to~4 \u00d7 10 4 bp). Virus replication occurs within the cytosol forming membrane invaginations derived from the ER. Replication of their (+)strand RNA genome involves partially double-stranded RNA intermediates. The detection of dsRNA by IF was thus used as a surrogate for active viral replication. Hagemeijier et al. [66] used the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model to study coronaviral replication factories by EU incorporation and click chemistry. Surprisingly, while IF detection of dsRNA early post infection correlated with EU click signals, indicating nascent RNA synthesis, this correlation was lost at later time points, suggesting that factories lose their replicative capacity over time, and that the labeling of de novo synthesized RNA is necessary to identify sites of ongoing CoV replication [66] . For the CoV porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), it was shown that EU click signals colocalize with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the viral nucleocapsid protein [94] . This system was used to characterize the mode of action of a small molecule CoV inhibitor, which targets the viral RNP complex and blocks RNA replication as well as RdRP and nucleocapsid synthesis [94] . Other examples where EU/click labeling was successfully employed include chikungunya virus [95] and arenavirus replication-transcription complexes [96] . For members of the medically-important genus of Flavivirus (e.g., Dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus) and the related genus Hepacivirus (e.g., hepatitis C virus), systems for following virus replication by metabolic/click labeling are yet to be established.",

One important mechanism involves the shutdown of host RNA transcription without affecting viral RNA replication (by using viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) and specialized transcription initiation mechanisms). Metabolic incorporation of EU can be used to visualize host cell transcriptional shutdown during RNA virus infection. For example, this approach was employed to investigate the role of the non-structural protein s (NSs) of members belonging to the order of Bunyavirales as a pathogenicity factor [97] . Cells infected with Rift valley fever virus (RVFV), which is highly pathogenic in animals and can also cause severe illness in humans, showed decreased EU/click signals of cellular genomic DNA, indicating impaired transcription; this effect was also observed upon expression of NSs alone [98] . In contrast, the NSs protein of the related but less virulent Toscana Virus (TSV) had no effect on host cell transcription and EU-click levels [99] .",

            "text": "A disadvantage of the metabolic incorporation of modified nucleotides is that the strategy is not specific to the viral structure or process of interest, but detects all nascent DNA (or RNA) molecules. This can present significant difficulties for detecting signals from individual viral particles. The problem may be addressed via reduction of cellular background using small molecule inhibitors (e.g., aphidicolin for host cell DNA synthesis; actinomycin D for host cell transcription). However, impairment of host cell functions by drug treatment may affect experimental results. Furthermore, aphidicolin also blocks DNA polymerases of some viruses (e.g., HSV-1 or vaccinia virus). Nucleoside analogs that are preferential substrates for the viral polymerase of interest, and are thus specifically incorporated, would overcome this obstacle.",

To date, this has not been achieved in eukaryotes, but the first results from prokaryotic cells [56] [57] [58] are promising. This approach would not only increase the number of unnatural amino acid residues that could be encoded, but it would also allow incorporation of fluorophores at defined nucleotide positions and the application of super-resolution microscopy to study the ultrastructure of DNA or RNA within viral particles. Structural rearrangements during e.g., reverse transcription of retroviruses could be visualized and correlated to distinct steps during this complex process. Expanding the EdU-mediated detection of retroviral reverse transcription and pre-integration complexes from HIV-1 [67] [68] [69] to other retroviruses, comparing the post-entry behavior of lentiviruses that have the ability to infect non-dividing cells to that of simple retroviruses requiring nuclear breakdown during mitosis would shed further light on the complex requirements for retroviral replication.",

However, these approaches mostly require genetic modification of the viral genome with large and often repetitive sequences. A simple and rapid method that allows the use of wild type virus together with recently developed live-compatible click reactions (e.g., inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions) is still missing. Such systems would not only significantly advance our understanding of DNA and RNA dynamics in virus replication; they would also enable ultrastructural investigation of RNA and DNA containing subviral complexes by CLEM and cryo-CLEM, which is currently hampered by cellular extraction and destruction of ultrastructure through CuAAC. Nucleosides bearing vinyl- [103] or azidomethyl groups [104] have been developed with the aim of allowing copper-independent click labeling of DNA under live cell conditions. Currently available derivatives are characterized by slow reaction kinetics, which impede the observation of dynamic processes. Furthermore, the efficient click labeling of these analogs requires the denaturation of samples with hydrochloric acid, precluding live cell applications. Novel nucleosides that can be efficiently click-labeled under live cell conditions with rapid kinetics would be beneficial not only for virological studies, but also for cell biology in general.",

By combining specificity, spatial precision and flexibility with respect to the choice of the click ligand, the minimally-invasive modification of virion components via click chemistry allows virologists to fully profit from these technical advancements and to complement imaging studies by biochemical analyses. While the click labeling of viral nucleic acids has already yielded numerous insights into virus biology, the exploitation of click chemistry for labeling viral proteins has just begun, and the extension of the approach to the investigation of viral lipids still lies ahead. In the coming years, improvements with respect to orthogonal multi-color labeling at multiple sites, stable GCE competent cell lines or even organisms and live-cell compatible systems can be expected, promising bright prospects for virus imaging.
