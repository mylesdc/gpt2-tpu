            "text": "Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is a lipid kinase involved in endosome maturation that emerged from a haploid genetic screen as being required for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC 50 , 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug's observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.The recent outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in Western Africa highlights the urgent need to develop therapeutics to help quell this devastating hemorrhagic fever virus, especially in resource-limited areas around the globe. Here we show that apilimod, an investigational drug that was well-tolerated in phase 2 clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis, is a strong inhibitor of both EBOV and Marburgvirus infections in multiple cell types. Further work shows that apilimod blocks the entry of EBOV particles into the host cell cytoplasm and that it does so by blocking the particles from reaching their normal portal of entry, in Niemann-Pick C1-positive endolysosomes. Our findings are consistent with the identity of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5kinase as the molecular target of apilimod, as the kinase and its product phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate are required for the proper maturation of late endocytic organelles. Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored for repositioning as part of a therapeutic regimen to help ameliorate the sequelae of filoviral infections.

The drug was developed as a suppressor of interleukin 12 and 23 production [55] , and was tested in phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of Crohn's disease [56, 57] , psoriasis [58] , and rheumatoid arthritis [59] . Although no clinical benefit has yet been reported, apilimod is deemed to be well tolerated in humans. We chose to test whether apilimod could inhibit infections by EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) for three reasons. The first was that apilimod binds [54] to the EBOV entry factor PIKfyve [37] . The second was because apilimod emerged from a blinded screen of 35 drugs (S1 Fig; S1 Table) , which were selected as potential inhibitors based upon hypotheses of drugable targets and from theoretical considerations of pathways possibly involved in the EBOV life cycle. The third reason was because apilimod is well tolerated in humans. We find that apilimod inhibits infection by both EBOV and MARV, being notably effective in primary human macrophages, which are initial targets of filoviral infection [60, 61] . Mechanistic studies revealed that apilimod blocks EBOV entry into the cell cytoplasm by working through PIKfyve and that its effect is to block viral particle trafficking to NPC1 + endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion [39] [40] [41] . Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a cocktail of small molecules to combat EVD.",

To test this hypothesis we overexpressed PIKfyve (GFP-PIKfyve) and compared the dose response needed for apilimod to block EBOV-GP mediated pseudovirus infection. As predicted, and as seen in Fig 4, higher doses of apilimod were needed to achieve similar levels of inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated infection in GFP-PIKfyve vs. GFP expressing cells. This supports our proposal that apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection through a PIKfyve-dependent pathway.",

We used BSC-1 cells for these experiments as they are more suitable (flatter and more adherent) for immunofluorescence analysis than the HEK 293T/17 cells used in previous experiments (Figs 3 and 4) . We first demonstrated that apilimod blocks EBOV VLP entry into BSC-1 cells with the same approximate dose-dependency as its effects in HEK 293T/17 cells (Fig 3D) . Given that, we next asked if apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1 + endolysosomes in BSC-1 cells. As seen in Fig 5, this was, indeed, the case. Apilimod blocked EBOV VLP trafficking to NPC1 + endolysosomes to a similar extent as nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer that is known to block traffic between early and late endosomes [67] .",

            "text": "The findings presented in Figs 5 and 6 indicate that the primary mechanism by which apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection (Figs 1-4) is by blocking virus transport from early (EEA1 + ) endosomes to their site of fusion in NPC1 + endolysosomes. To further test this model, we asked whether apilimod affects other attributes of the endosomal pathway needed for EBOV entry, either endosome acidification or the activity of cathepsin B and L [42, 43] . At a concentration that strongly blocked EBOV entry and infection, apilimod had no detectable effect on endosome acidification (Fig 7) . Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of EBOV infection that blocks endosome acidification, was used as a positive control. Apilimod also had no apparent direct effect on the activity of cathepsin B and L (Fig 8) , in contrast to EST, a known inhibitor of cathepsin B, H, and L. Several cationic amphiphilic drugs such as U18666A that block EBOV entry and infection [20] [21] [22] 24, 25, 68] induce cholesterol accumulation in endolysosomes [20, 24] . In contrast, apilimod did not cause a detectable increase in cholesterol levels in endolysosomes (Fig 9) . Hence apilimod appears to block filoviral entry and infection by inhibiting virus particle trafficking to NPC1 + endolysosomes, the portal for entry of the EBOV genome into the host cell cytoplasm [39] [40] [41] .",

            "text": "As tragically demonstrated by the recent epidemic of EVD in Western Africa (2013-2016), a pressing need remains to develop therapeutics to treat patients infected with filoviruses [1] . While novel monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapeutics are in the pipeline [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , a parallel approach is to consider repositioning an approved drug or a drug that has proven safe in phase 2 clinical trials to treat EVD. In this study we tested the potential utility of apilimod as an anti-filoviral agent. We evaluated this drug for three reasons: (a) apilimod directly targets PIKfyve [54] , a known EBOV entry factor [37] ; (b) apilimod emerged from a blinded screen of 35 drugs targeting cell signaling pathways (S1 Fig and S1 Table) ; and (c) apilimod was reported to be well tolerated in humans in several phase 2 clinical trials [56] [57] [58] [59] . After demonstrating that apilimod has activity against both EBOV and MARV in several cell types, notably in human macrophages (Figs 1 and 2, Table 1 ), we demonstrated that, by working through PIKfyve, its primary mode of action is to block trafficking of EBOV particles to NPC1 + endolysosomes (Figs 3-9) , the site of EBOV fusion and entry [39] [40] [41] .",

            "text": "The inhibitory effect of apilimod on EBOV entry is likely due to a defect in the maturation of endolysosomes, as extensive evidence indicates the importance of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P 2 in this process [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Although the exact mechanism by which PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P 2 orchestrate endosome maturation is not known, several mechanisms have been postulated. Considered in these mechanisms are the observations that two Ca ++ channels found in (endo) lysosomes-transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) [50, 69] and TPC2 [70] [71] [72] -are downstream effectors of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P 2 . Through its action on TRPML1, PIKfyve has been shown to regulate the fission and consequent remodeling and maturation that reduces the size of macropinosomes containing endocytosed material from the cell surface and exterior [50] . In addition, the TPC2 channel has been reported to be activated by PI(3,5)P 2 [71, 72] . Intriguingly, both macropinocytosis [35, 73, 74] and TPC2 [75] are involved in EBOV entry and infection. Although we do not yet know all of the endolysosomal factors needed to trigger EBOV GP for fusion [36, 39, 43, 76] , it appears clear that proper endosomal maturation is required. These findings are consistent with the mounting evidence for a role of PIKfyve in EBOV entry and our observation that the PIKfyve inhibitor, apilimod, blocks transport of EBOV particles to NPC1 + endolysosomes. It is therefore likely that interconnected effects of apilimod on PIKfyve [37, 54] , TPC2 [75] , and endolysosome maturation culminate in its blockade of EBOV entry and infection.",

Hence the mode of action of apilimod as an anti-filoviral agent is novel.

We therefore consider it likely that apilimod, a host-directed small molecule, will have broad or even pan-filoviral activity. Furthermore, since many other viruses, socalled late penetrating viruses [36, 81] , traffic beyond early endosomes for entry, it is possible that apilimod will block entry and infection by members of other virus families.",

Although it has been tested in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the drug has not yet been approved for any indication. Nonetheless apilimod was well-tolerated in humans in the reported phase 2 trials [56] [57] [58] [59] . We found that intraperitoneal delivery of 10 mg/kg of apilimod to mice resulted in a C max of 2.53 \u03bcM. This is well above the IC 50 for apilimod inhibition of EBOV infection in the three cell lines tested,~250 times greater than the IC 50 in hMDMs (10 nM), initial major targets of filoviral infections [60, 61] . We therefore consider it plausible that apilimod be used in the treatment of EVD. And, while apilimod may not function as a single agent, it may perform well as a component in an anti-filoviral small molecule cocktail. In summary, we introduce apilimod, a small molecule PIKfyve inhibitor that has proven safe in phase 2 clinical trials, as a potential anti-filoviral agent.",
