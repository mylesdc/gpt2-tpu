An important challenge in infectious disease research is to understand molecular similarities and differences in mammalian host response to diverse sets of pathogens. Recently, systems biology studies have produced rich collections of omic profiles measuring host response to infectious agents such as influenza viruses at multiple levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network driving host response to multiple infectious agents, we integrated host transcriptomes and proteomes using a network-based approach. Our approach combines expression-based regulatory network inference, structured-sparsity based regression, and network information flow to infer putative physical regulatory programs for expression modules. We applied our approach to identify regulatory networks, modules and subnetworks that drive host response to multiple influenza infections. The inferred regulatory network and modules are significantly enriched for known pathways of immune response and implicate apoptosis, splicing, and interferon signaling processes in the differential response of viral infections of different pathogenicities. We used the learned network to prioritize regulators and study virus and time-point specific networks. RNAi-based knockdown of predicted regulators had significant impact on viral replication and include several previously unknown regulators. Taken together, our integrated analysis identified novel module level patterns that capture strain and pathogenicityspecific patterns of expression and helped identify important regulators of host response to influenza infection.",

An important component of mounting proper response is the transcriptional regulatory network that specifies the context-specific gene expression program in the host cell. However, our understanding of this regulatory network and how it drives context-specific transcriptional programs is incomplete. To address this gap, we performed a network-based analysis of host response to influenza viruses that integrated high-throughput mRNA-and protein measurements and protein-protein interaction networks to identify virus and pathogenicity-specific modules and their upstream physical regulatory programs. We inferred regulatory networks for human cell line and mouse host systems, which recapitulated several known regulators and pathways of the immune response and viral life cycle. We used the networks to study time point and strain-specific subnetworks and to prioritize important regulators of host response. We predicted several novel regulators, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and experimentally verified their role in the virus life cycle based on their ability to significantly impact viral replication.",

A key challenge in current infectious disease research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that make the host immune system more or less susceptible to a particular strain of a pathogen, for example, different influenza A virus strains, than another. Transcriptional regulatory networks that connect regulatory proteins to target genes are central players in how mammalian cells mount appropriate responses to different pathogenic infections. Because the components and connectivity of these networks are largely not known, a significant amount of effort has been invested to collect high-throughput datasets that provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of host response to multiple viruses at multiple levels, including the transcriptome and proteome [1] [2] [3] [4] . These genomic datasets provide unique opportunities to identify molecular network components of host response that are conserved across multiple viruses or specific to a virus of a particular pathogenicity. Such networks can be used to prioritize regulators for follow up validation studies that provide greater insight into the mechanisms by which the host cell perceives and responds to different pathogenic infections.",

The majority of these approaches have used genome-wide transcriptomic data and can be grouped into those that infer correlational networks [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , or Module Networks, in which regulators are inferred for groups of coexpressed genes called modules [9, 13, 14] . A few approaches have integrated additional data types, e.g. physical protein-protein or signaling networks with transcriptional data [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , that vary in the number of samples needed to infer networks. While these approaches have provided important insights into the host response, they have not integrated multiple types of omic measurements (e.g. mRNA and protein levels), which can differ in quality and sample size. A second challenge is that experimental validation of large-scale predictions is expensive and most of the generated predictions have not been validated experimentally.

We then use proteomic measurements to predict additional regulators of gene modules by applying a structured sparsity-inducing regression approach, Multi-Task Group LASSO, to find proteins whose levels are predictive of mRNA levels of entire modules. By decoupling the mRNA and protein-based regression into two steps, our approach is less sensitive to varying sample size for each type of omic data.

We used a recently developed network inference algorithm, 'Modular regulatory network learning with per gene information' (MERLIN [22] ) that uses genome-wide mRNA levels from multiple biological samples (time points or treatments) to predict regulatory relationships between regulators (e.g. transcription factors or signaling proteins) and target genes. Our rationale for selecting MERLIN was to enable the study of host response regulatory networks both at the individual gene level and at the module level. Alternative methods either infer the regulators for individual genes [23] or for gene modules [13, 24] , but not both. We applied MERLIN within a stability selection framework to the host transcriptional measurements of mouse lungs and human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3 cell line) infected with one of six influenza virus strains exhibiting a range of pathogenicity levels (Materials and Methods). On the human Calu-3 cell line (Fig 2) , we identified 41 consensus modules of at least 10 genes comprising a total of 4,801 genes (~67% of the input, Table 1 ). On the mouse data, we identified 56 modules, encompassing 2,944 genes (41% of the input, Table 1 ). The average expression patterns in each inferred module revealed commonalities and differences between strains and pathogenicity levels (Fig 2, Calu-3; S1 Fig, mouse) . Based on a hypergeometric test with FDR correction (FDR<0.05), 32 out of the 41 human Calu-3 modules (40 of 56 mouse modules) exhibited enrichment in one or more of the annotation categories representing Gene Ontology processes, KEGG pathways, and influenza related gene sets identified from 10 high-throughput RNAi studies and viral-host protein-protein interaction screens (Fig 2, S1 Fig, S1 Table, S2 Table) . Moreover, 17 of the human modules were enriched specifically for immune response related Overview of human influenza response module expression patterns. Shown are 41 human Calu-3 modules with at least 10 genes. The red-blue heat map shows mean expression of all genes in each module. The more red an entry the higher the expression in infected versus mock, while the more blue the entry, the higher the expression in mock compared to the infected sample.

We identified 15 pairs of modules that significantly overlapped in the gene content (p-value<0.05) between the two species ( Fig 4A) . The number of genes involved in this overlap was fairly modest, illustrating the challenges of integrating data Fig 3B) , including a core set of 96 interactions, 48 of which form subnetworks with at least 3 genes ( Fig 4B) . This conserved regulatory network contained many key players from the interferon production and JAK-STAT pathways (STAT1, NMI, IRF7; [27, 28] ) as well as regulators about which little is known, perhaps representing new relevant host processes. One conserved regulator with many conserved targets was ZNHIT3 (also known as TRIP3), a zinc finger HIT domain-containing protein that binds to thyroid hormone receptor [29] , but which is otherwise poorly characterized in the pathway databases. In summary, the enrichment of immune related functions, motif instances of known immune response TFs, agreement with existing computational and experimentally generated immune response related networks, and the conservation of the key immune related modules and networks between two distinct host systems is indicative of valid regulatory programs that can be explored with further experimental analysis.",

We selected 20 regulators based primarily on the human rankings, the known annotations of the regulators, expression of the regulator's module and to exclude well-studied immune response regulators (IRF7, NMI, STAT1). To experimentally validate our networkbased prioritization scheme, we measured H1N1 virus replication in human lung epithelial cells (A549) following knockdown of predicted human regulators of host response by siRNA (Materials and Methods, S7 Table) . For each gene, four siRNAs were used, in order to mitigate off-target or cytotoxic effects of single siRNAs. We called a gene a high confidence hit using a stringent criteria requiring at least two siRNAs (out of four used for each gene) to yield a statistically significant (t-test p-value <0.05) and high-magnitude (10 fold) change in virus titer compared to negative controls, and if none of the siRNAs yielded a significant change in the opposite direction. Using these strict criteria, three out of the twenty tested regulators were called hits: BOLA1, HCLS1, and HOXA7 ( Table 2) . Three additional regulators were mediumconfidence hits with > 5 fold change but significant and consistent effects in multiple siRNAs: Conservation between human and mouse subnetworks. A. Modules conserved between human and mouse. There were fifteen (red shading) significantly overlapping module pairs (hypergeometric p-value < 0.0001), including 12 human modules and 13 mouse modules. B. A core set of interactions conserved between the human and mouse consensus regulatory networks. Shown are the 48 of 96 shared interactions that belong to subnetworks with at least three nodes. Shading indicates Calu-3 ISGs (violet) and nodes identified both as known host genes and ISGs (magenta). Star indicates a gene that significantly impacted viral replication on knockdown as identified in this study. FGFR3, IRAK3, and YTHDC1. Knockdown of all six of the above consistently resulted in reduced virus titer, suggesting that the genes are important for virus production. Other tested regulators had multiple significant siRNAs, but conferred lower fold changes or showed divergent changes in viral titer between different siRNAs for the same gene. We note that some of the genes in our study for which multiple siRNAs had statistically significant but inconclusive direction or magnitude of effects were identified as hits by genome-wide screens (S7 Table) . While understanding the detailed role of these predicted regulators in viral replication will require further experiments, these results suggest that our network inference and prioritization method can successfully identify important regulators of host response.",

However, there were three reasons that prevented us from doing this. First, entire time courses of protein measurements were missing, and integration into the initial network inference step would require either extensive interpolation of entire time courses or excluding many mRNA measurements. Second, only~20% of our candidate regulators (signaling proteins and TFs) with available mRNA levels were measured at the protein levels (S4 Table, S5 Table) .

            "text": "Our predictive modeling approach used a structured-sparsity based regression framework, called Multi-Task Group LASSO (MTG-LASSO, Fig 5A) [30, 31] . Our approach is based on using group LASSO for multi-task feature selection [30, 31] . Unlike LASSO [32] , which solves one regression problem at a time, MTG-LASSO aims to solve multiple regression problems simultaneously, one for each gene in a module. Our regression formulation has two properties: (a) multi-task regression (where each task is the regression problem of each gene in a module) and (b) group LASSO, to enable selection of the same regulators (with possibly different regression weights) for all genes in a module. LASSO-based approaches have been applied extensively for mRNA-based regulatory network inference [24, 33] ; however, to our knowledge, our MTG-LASSO approach is the first to employ grouping structure in order to integrate sparse protein-level data with comparatively higher-coverage mRNA-level data. A module-based regression enables us to pool information from all genes in the module to select regulators that are informative for all genes in the module. The MTG-LASSO regression problem is illustrated in Fig 5A. The full protein data matrix, X consists of m samples for p proteins. All p proteins are used as covariates. The target gene expression matrix for a module, Y is an m X n matrix, each column representing the expression profile of a gene in the module. The regression weight matrix, W is a p X n matrix, each row representing the regression weight of a protein for all n genes. In the group LASSO framework, a pre-defined grouping structure of covariates is used to select or de-select a group of coefficients together. We define a group as the set of regression weights for a single protein's association to all module genes, resulting in p groups. The framework uses a mixed L1/L2-norm penalty to impose smoothness and sparsity: the number of proteins (groups) with any nonzero regression weights should be small, and the weights within a group should be similar.",

Both MTG-LASSO and LASSO have a regularization term, \u03bb, which controls the tradeoff between the model complexity penalty and a model's predictive power. We examined five settings of \u03bb, between 0.99 (highest penalty imposed, requiring few regulators) and 0.01 (least penalty imposed, allowing many regulators). The regularization term \u03bb is a number between 0 and 1. It denotes a fraction of \u03bb max (maximum possible regularization before reaching a 0 solution), and is comparable between MTG-LASSO and LASSO (see Materials and Methods).",

We quantified the ranking by the area under ROC curve (AUROC), treating MTG-LASSO as the positive class and the additional LASSO regulators as the negative class. The AUROC gives the probability that a randomly chosen MTG-LASSO regulator ranks above a randomly chosen LASSO regulator. For human, AUROC ranged between 0.96-0.99, and for mouse 0.91-0.98 when considering all genes together. The high ranking of MTG-LASSO regulators in the LASSO selected regulators is observed on a per-module level as well (S4D and S4E Fig) .",

            "text": "Because MTG-LASSO learned a subset of the LASSO regulators, we asked if the regulators that were identified by LASSO but not MTG-LASSO were known to be important based on existing siRNA screening studies. Focusing on modules that were predicted better than random (11 in human and 36 in mouse), we defined consensus regulators per-module as regulators that were selected in at least 6 of 10 folds of cross-validation after determining a module-specific value of \u03bb (Materials and Methods, Fig 5D and 5E ). Our analysis identified a total of 17 human consensus protein regulators for 11 modules in human (1-6 protein regulators per module, Table 3 ; selected regulators shown in Fig 3A) and a total of 33 consensus protein regulators predicted for 36 modules in mouse (1-6 regulators per module, Table 4 , S8 Table) . A similar analysis for LASSO identified 60 different regulators for human and 79 for mouse, which contained the MTG-LASSO regulators entirely (S9 Table) . Comparable proportions of the consensus regulators identified by each method have been found as hits in published influenza screening studies (for human, MTG-LASSO 23.5% and 18% LASSO; for mouse, MTG-LASSO 18% and LASSO 20%). Because the MTG-LASSO regulators were included in the LASSO rankings we also computed the precision after excluding the MTG-LASSO regulators. In human the precision was markedly lower (16.3%), and slightly lower in mouse (19.6%). Thus for the human cell line data, there is a distinct advantage of using MTG-LASSO to quickly identify the important regulators. The mouse data is more challenging likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the cell populations. Together, these results suggests that MTG-LASSO is able to learn as good a predictive model as regular LASSO, and is particularly advantageous for identifying regulators at the module level. Below we further experimentally validate the MTG-LASSO regulators.",

            "text": "We first qualitatively examined our regulators based on known literature and annotation of these regulators. Several of our MTG-LASSO protein regulators are known to be associated with immune response pathways, cellular membranes and intracellular transport, RNA splicing machinery, mitochondrial inflammation, and may be involved in viral replication, entry or transport within the cell (Tables 3 and 4) . We experimentally validated seven of the 17 human MTG-LASSO regulators for which we already had siRNA libraries (Table 5, S7 Table) , transfecting cells with 4 siRNAs per regulator. For all seven regulators at least two of the four siR-NAs resulted in a significant change in virus titer, and had at least one siRNA resulted in a fold-change far beyond 10-fold. Unlike in the mRNA case, where most of the significant and high magnitude changes were in one direction, for several of the protein regulators, different siRNAs targeting the same gene resulted in both significant and high magnitude increase and decrease in viral replication. We therefore used a majority rule on the significant changes to phenotypically characterize the effect of knockdown of a particular protein regulation. Specifically, a gene was called \"pro\" viral replication if the number of significant decreases in viral replication was greater than the number of significant increases. Similarly, a gene was called \"anti\" viral replication if knocking it down resulted in more significant increases than decreases in viral replication. Among the seven proteins that were tested, four were classified as \"pro\" viral replication with more significant decreases in viral replication (HIST1HB, ISG15, PRPF31, THBS1), while three were called as \"anti\" viral replication with significant increase in viral replication (APP, ITGB4, SERPINA3). PRPF31, which had the strongest, consistent effect across all significant siRNAs, is a pre-mRNA splicing factor that was previously implicated in viral replication by a genome-wide screen. It is known that the host RNA splicing machinery is hijacked by influenza virus [34] . ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is stimulated by interferon alpha and beta and is associated with diverse cellular functions including cell-to-cell signaling and anti-viral activity. Hence, ISG15's pro-viral phenotype was surprising. However, this protein has been observed to be attached to both host and viral proteins [35] and has been previously shown to reduce viral replication on knockdown in a previous study [36] . THBS1 is a ligand of CD47 and an inhibitor of T and dendritic cells and may play a role in inhibiting inflammation [37] . SERPINA3 and APP in particular are interesting candidates as potential inhibitors of viral replication. The serine protease inhibitor SERPINA3 (module 1484) and its mouse homologs Serpina3k (two modules) and Serpina3m (eight modules) were identified independently for both species. SERPINA3 belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors that have diverse roles in innate immunity [38] [39] [40] . While SERPINA3 has not been shown to affect viral replication, another member of this family, SERPINE1, was shown to reduce the infectivity of the virus particle [41] . APP has been mostly studied for its role in neurodegenerative diseases: beta amyloid plaques are associated with neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's Disease [42] but a recent study also suggests it may have an antiviral role, based on observations of decreased influenza A replication (H1N1 and H3N2) in cells treated with beta amyloid [43] , consistent with the increase in viral titer observed in this study. Taken together, our results indicate that MTG-LASSO can identify regulator candidates that are relevant to immune responses to viral infections. Overall MTG-LASSO's ability to highly rank the most relevant regulators is an important factor for tractable downstream interpretation and validation of selected regulators.",

This type of analysis can be used to predict which network components may be repressed or differentially wired in response to different viruses. We built time point-specific active networks by overlaying time point-specific expression on the integrated regulatory network connecting both mRNA and protein regulators to their target genes. For each time point and virus, we obtained a time point-specific regulatory network by including inferred edges between regulator nodes (mRNA or proteins) and target genes (mRNA) that were significantly up-regulated (z-score ! 2, compared to all expression values at that time point). For this analysis we focused on the Calu-3 data set. Examination of the active network size (number of edges, regulators and targets) over time showed that the size of networks for each viral treatment tended to change by adding more edges over time (S5 Fig), with the H5N1 mutants and wild-type achieving the largest networks. Interestingly, H1N1 NL's network grew more slowly than that of H1N1 CA04 (S5 Fig), although the networks for the two viruses were highly similar in terms of which nodes and edges they contained by the last time point (S6 Fig) .",

Predicted regulators in this cluster included key immune response regulators at the mRNA (e.g. IRF7, STAT1, TRIM21, NMI) and the protein level (ISG15p). In terms of pathogenicity, the NS1trunc virus is more lethal than the H1N1 strains; however, truncated NS1 protein disrupts the virus' ability to effectively suppress host immune response. The H5N1 NS1trunc mutant in particular displayed an interesting clustering pattern across the other clusters. It was represented in two clusters that represent late response to other medium-and high-pathogenicity viruses (Clusters D, E), but absent from a cluster that represents early-onset sustained edges among H5N1 strains (Cluster C) as well as from Cluster B, which included edges from all other viral strains. Cluster B and Cluster C, which are associated with the two highly pathogenic viruses are associated with GPCR signaling and muscle contraction and include some of our siRNA based regulators (YTHDC1, Cluster B) and (HCLS1, HOXA7, Cluster C). Both Clusters D and E, which include active edges primarily from the high and medium pathogenicity viruses, are associated with signaling pathways including Wnt signaling and the circadian clock. Wnt signaling has been implicated in influenza infections [14, 44] , while disruptions in circadian clocks have been shown to increase susceptibility of the immune system to infections [45] .",

            "text": "In summary, our active network analysis identifies different subnetwork components that are specific to different viruses, and implicates additional processes that might be relevant in a strain-specific manner. Our analyses thus far inferred two sets of regulators for each module: (1) mRNA-based regulators, signaling proteins and TFs, predicted by MERLIN based on transcriptome changes, and (2) protein-based regulators predicted by MTG-LASSO based on proteome and transcriptome changes. Both these types of regulators were predicted based on patterns of co-variation of regulators and targets (at the individual gene or module levels). What is missing is information about the underlying physical mechanisms that connect the signaling proteins to transcription factors, and the protein-level regulators to the mRNA-level regulators. To gain insight into the underlying physical mechanisms that connect the regulators, and to link them to host genes identified from functional screening studies, we integrated the predicted regulators with physical protein-protein interactions, transcription factor-target interactions, and metabolic reactions from multiple public databases (Materials and Methods). Typically, the interaction data do not provide evidence for direct interactions between regulators, requiring the identification of additional intermediate nodes that connect these regulators. However, even allowing only one intermediate node can result in large subnetworks that are unwieldy for interpretation (see for example Fig 7A) . Furthermore, because available interactions are not condition-specific, they may contain false positive interactions and may be missing relevant connections. To identify high-confidence physical subnetworks that are easily interpretable, we formulated a constrained optimization problem to find directed paths that connect MERLIN-identified signaling proteins to transcription factors and MTG-LASSO-identified proteins to MERLIN regulators using a minimal set of intermediate nodes (Materials and Methods), prioritizing the inclusion of host genes that were recently identified by Watanabe et al. [46] using both . Nodes without borders are candidate intermediates between two regulators and were not given special treatment by the method. Node color indicates host genes involved in influenza obtained from siRNA or protein interaction studies and Calu-3 ISGs (as in Fig 3) ; this information is for visualization purposes and is not used in the subnetwork inference method. RNAi and co-immunoprecipitation with viral proteins. Such nodes are important in the virusspecific protein-protein interaction network and provide additional context for interpreting our predicted transcriptome and proteome-based regulators. We applied an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach to solve this optimization problem, which has been shown to find more precise solutions compared to heuristic algorithms [47] [48] [49] .",

Nine of the module subnetworks included predicted protein regulators. The high-confidence subnetworks were able to connect more true regulators with fewer intermediate nodes than subnetworks inferred from random regulators with the same degree distribution, suggesting that the sparsity of the high-confidence physical subnetworks was not merely due to the degree of the input regulators in the physical interaction network (S3 Text). We also used the random input subnetworks to compute an empirical FDR for each protein by measuring the frequency at which the protein appears randomly, and found that it ranged from 0-0.4, demonstrating that many of the proteins used in the subnetworks are unlikely to be identified by chance (Materials and Methods). A low FDR is a conservative measure of a protein's importance, as many relevant proteins are network hubs and are likely to be identified by chance.",

One of these modules was Module 1549, which was associated with immune response-related processes by many of our computational analyses (Figs 7 and 8) . Module 1549 exhibited a particularly interesting strain-specific pattern of induced expression under infection with low-pathogenicity viruses and the medium pathogenicity virus, H5N1-NS1trunc, and repressed expression under infection with high pathogenicity viruses (Fig 8) . Module 1549 is also enriched for genes associated with interferon signaling, which are critical for mounting the innate immune response. The influenza NS1 ('non-structural') protein is already known to inhibit the host's antiviral type I interferon response [50] , suggesting that this module would be a good candidate for further investigation into the mechanism of action of NS1. Furthermore, the genes in Module 1549 overlapped significantly with two mouse modules (Fig 4A) , and its regulators featured prominently in the conserved regulatory network identified by the intersection of the human and mouse consensus networks ( Fig  4B) . This module is associated with NFS1, APP, SERPINA3, and ITGBP protein regulators, and IRF7, NMI, and STAT1 mRNA regulators, which are well-known members of the interferon response and JAK-STAT antiviral response pathway [27, 28] . The subnetwork analysis applied to the regulators of this module highlighted HSPA4, also known as Hsp70, as a hub that connects gene members from multiple immune response pathways (Fig 7B) . HSPA4 has been proposed as both an antiviral factor [51] as well as a chaperone required for viral replication [52] . HSPA4's direct subnetwork connections include members and modulators of the antiviral JAK-STAT pathway (ISG15 [53] , FGFR3, STAT1) and also inflammation (APP). FGFR3 was a hit in our MERLIN-network based prioritization siRNA study and acts as a modulator of the JAK-STAT pathway in growth disorders such as achondroplasia (OMIM). APP was identified as an inhibitor of viral replication in our siRNA validation. Other important genes in this subnetwork are the protein regulator THBS1 and an mRNA-based regulator, MLKL. THBS1 is involved in apoptosis [54] and potentially inhibiting inflammation [37] , and our siRNA validation results classify it as a pro-viral replication gene, while MLKL induces necroptosis (inflammatory cell death; [55] ). As a whole, the subnetwork for Module 1549 ties together multiple immune response pathways, namely, antiviral interferon signaling, inflammation and apoptosis.",

We found that the key components of innate immune response processes namely, interferon production and signaling, and important regulators of immune response (STAT1, NMI, IRF7), were conserved between a human cell-line (in vitro) and mouse lung (in vivo) model system.

While a large number of prioritization methods, including network-based strategies, have been proposed [63] and computationally validated, relatively few have been used to inform experimental validation in a medium to high-throughput manner [21, 64] . Towards this end we used our inferred MERLIN networks to prioritize important regulators of host response and test 20 regulators using siRNA. Six of the 20 regulators exhibited highly significant and consistent effects on viral replication and included 4 novel mRNA regulators (BOLA1, HOXA1, HCLS1, FGFR3) in addition to IRAK3 and YTHDC1, which were identified by genome-wide studies using a different influenza virus [65, 66] . Mice lacking IRAK3 have an increased mortality rate compared to wild type in influenza-induced pneumonia [67] . BOLA1 is a mitochondrial protein, which helps maintain mitochondrial morphology and oxidative stress [68] . Mitochondria provide important innate immune functions, including cellular response to double-stranded viral DNA by induction of cytokines through the MAVS (mitochondrion antiviral signaling) protein [69] . Influenza A virus proteins have also been shown to translocate to mitochondrial membranes and promote mitochondrial fragmentation [70] . HCLS1, which is a hematopoetic lineage specific protein [71] , is also interesting due to its role in signal transduction pathways in B and T cells [72, 73] . HOXA7 is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors, known to have critical roles in differentiation and embryonic development. The HOXA7 gene has to our knowledge not been associated with specific immune related functions, however, a closely related gene, HOXA9 was shown to be involved in lymphoid and B cell development, which are important cell types of the immune system [74] . The HOXA7 gene was also shown to code an antigen in specific tumor types [75] and could be involved in differentiation programs of immune cell types in response to influenza infections. Finally, FGFR3, a fibroblast growth factor receptor gene is known to have diverse roles in multiple cellular functions [76] [77] [78] . The FGFR1-4 genes were investigated for their role in influenza A viruses [79] . FGFR1 was shown to significantly impact cellular internalization of two influenza A viruses but FGFR3 was not expressed in the cell line tested, leaving open the possibility of its potential role in the influenza life cycle. To our knowledge, these regulators have no previously known role in influenza response, but serve as promising leads for further in-depth validation studies using in vivo models.",

            "text": "While approaches to infer and examine networks from mRNA are routinely used in systems biology studies of complex responses [2, 6, 80] , examining proteomic datasets and especially integrating them with transcriptomic data to gain insight into regulatory mechanisms is an open challenge that has been addressed by relatively few approaches [7, 49, 81] . This is because, unlike mRNA levels, proteomic technologies are still maturing and datasets have lower genome coverage and higher frequency of missing values [82] . To tackle this challenge we introduced a novel structured sparsity inducing approach, Multi-task Group LASSO (MTG-LASSO), which enabled us to leverage the overall signature of expression at the level of modules. Our experiments confirmed that while the MTG-LASSO and LASSO achieved comparable prediction performance on held-aside data, the MTG-LASSO approach identified a sparser set of regulators per module. Proteins with the strongest contributions to module expression prediction were involved in innate immune response pathways, RNA splicing, membrane organization and transport, that are relevant to different parts of virus life cycle. Experimental validation of these regulators further associated pro or anti-viral replication functions with them. Both directions are interesting from the point of view of understanding the mechanisms of immune response as well as for designing vaccines that could disrupt viral replication and growth. PRPF31, which is involved in RNA splicing, was particularly notable as an example of a pro-viral replication regulator, given the emerging role of post-transcriptional process in diverse pathogenic infections including bacterial pathogens [83] . SERPINA3 (anti-viral, serine protease inhibitor) is also interesting as a candidate anti-viral drug target due to the known roles of serpins in innate immunity [38] [39] [40] . We also predict a pro-viral role of ISG15, an interferon stimulated protein and that is involved in diverse processes including anti-viral activity. Importantly, several predictive protein regulators were not identified as differentially expressed at the mRNA level (7/17 for human; 22/33 for mouse; S4 Table, S5 Table) , emphasizing the importance of measuring multiple types of cellular components.",

Even though no information about known relevant pathways was provided as input, our approach was able to give interaction-driven predictions for how these different regulators are coordinated. A notable example was a newly identified gene, HSPA4, in module 1549's regulatory program, that connected FGFR3 (discussed above), STAT1 (a member of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway), and inflammation and cell death pathways (represented by THBS1 and APP).

            "text": "Our approach identified several important modules that exhibit strain and pathogenic specific patterns of expression. In particular, Module 1549, which was associated with interferon signaling and interferon-stimulated genes, exhibited a striking pattern of differential expression of repression in the wild-type H5N1 virus. Our results are consistent with those of [84] , who observed a differential pattern of expression of the ISG genes and showed that the differential expression of these genes were inherently tied to host response. Another module, Module 1540 exhibited an opposite pattern of expression and is associated with cell-cell signaling. One caveat to the validation was that we tested the siRNAs only in pandemic H1N1 and therefore we do not know how impact of these regulators in different virulent strains. The physical regulatory programs together with the expression phenotype associated with these modules enables us to make intriguing hypothesis of potential mechanisms by which upstream regulatory networks drive context-specific expression, which could be followed by further validation. Some of the same mRNA time courses have been previously studied with computational network approaches [8, 85] , offering additional points of reference against which to compare our inferred multi-virus regulatory network. Mitchell et al. [8] prioritized influenza host genes from wild-type H1N1 and H5N1 samples. They learned a correlational network from which they identified central nodes as well as modules. They also used a regularized regression approach (Inferelator, [24] ) to identify sparse regulator sets that predict the average module expression. Our top predicted regulators (both protein and mRNA) intersected with theirs on only one gene (NMI). The limited overlap may not be surprising as the bulk of our prioritized regulators were restricted to transcription factors and signaling proteins; however, similar gene families were present in our list and theirs (including DDX, HOX, and ISG genes). Additionally, McDermott et al. [85] previously analyzed the H5N1 mRNA time courses using a similar approach: first identifying modules through hierarchical clustering, followed by identification of regulators for the modules' average expression. That study identified a set of conserved clusters across human, mouse, and macaque, and a list of prioritized regulators. We found significant overlap of several of those clusters with several our modules (S9 Fig) , but no overlap in the presented prioritized regulators. However, both our study and theirs identified shared functional processes (cytokine signaling and production, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation) and gene families (IRF genes).",

Another direction of future work is to jointly learn modules and their physical regulatory programs using an iterative framework while integrating proteomic measurements. We anticipate that as systems biology studies expand to more viruses, host systems and diseases, approaches such as ours are going to be increasingly useful to characterize host responses at multiple omic levels, prioritize genes and subnetworks for validation. The outcomes from such studies will be important to assemble a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms responsible for healthy and disease states, and ultimately guide the design of effective therapeutics.",

The mutant strains of H5N1 each affect different aspects of the virus life cycle [1] . HAavir, used in the mouse experiments only, has restricted tissue tropism due to a mutated cleavage site in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. The wild-type H5N1 virus has a lysine at position 627 in the PB2 polymerase protein that is associated with the adaptation of H5N1 viruses to mammals. Mutation of this amino acid to glutamic acid (PB2-627E) reduces polymerase activity in mammalian cells and pathogenicity in mice. NS1trunc has a shortened version of the NS1 protein, thereby interfering with the virus' ability to suppress host antiviral responses through the RIG-1 pathway.

The parameter p controls regulatory network sparsity (more negative values, fewer edges), r controls network modularity (higher values, stronger preference for sharing regulators in a module), and h specifies a threshold on the distance used to cut a hierarchical clustering into gene modules (lower values, more modules). We derived a consensus regulatory module network in several steps from the ensemble of networks that were produced under stability selection. First, to derive a consensus network of regulator-target edges, we applied a threshold of 0.3 confidence to the confidence-weighted regulator-target edges produced by stability selection. This threshold was picked based on its FDR, assessed by comparing to a random consensus regulatory network generated by running the approach on 40 randomizations of the expression data. We calculated FDR as the ratio of the fraction of edges from the random network that would be accepted at the threshold, over the fraction of edges from the true network that were accepted by the threshold. The FDR of human and mouse networks were 0.30 and 0.17, respectively.",

We refer to the MERLIN network as the \"query\" network, and the other network as the \"test\" network. Because the networks were directed, we first defined the shared universe of regulators and the universe of targets as the intersections of the respective node sets from the two networks. Then, we defined the shared universe of edges as all possible edges between regulators and targets. The size of the universe, u, is calculated as the product of the numbers of regulators and targets in the universe. We measure overlap, o, as the number of edges in the universe that are common to both query and test. We measure the size of the query and test networks, q and t respectively, as the number of edges in each network restricted to the shared universe. To test significance of the size of the overlap, we use the hypergeometric distribution to assess the probability of identifying o or more overlapping edges in a random draw of q edges from a universe of size u that contains t test edges. Fold enrichment is defined as the ratio of observed to expected fraction of edge overlap between the two networks, or (o/q)/(t/u).",

For significant expression we used a t-test p-value < 0.01 for human and 0.05 for mouse.

Surprisingly, we observed that the curve did not have the same shape for each module. Among human modules, we found three categories of modules based on these curves. The first consisted of 10 modules for which correlation is roughly constant across all values of \u03bb; that is, all predictive performance on the held-aside data was entirely due to a very small set of regulators. The second consisted of another 10 modules for which performance improved as MTG-LASSO was allowed to use more regulators (as sparsity decreased). A final third category contained those modules that could not be predicted more accurately than random for more than one setting of \u03bb, usually the highest or lowest tested value (all remaining modules).",

We extract a subnetwork that connects all regulators by solving an integer linear program in which instructions for how paths may be chosen are expressed as linear constraints, and the objective function optimizes a global property of the subnetwork. Our constraints require the inclusion of reachable predicted regulators, and specify that each protein-protein interaction may only be used in one direction within the subnetwork. In the objective function, we encoded a preference that the subnetwork should use the influenza host genes from Watanabe et al. [46] as intermediates whenever possible, and to otherwise minimize the use of intermediate nodes. Because many subnetworks may satisfy these constraints, we combine multiple solutions to the ILP into an ensemble. We score each path by the fraction of solutions that contain that path. We defined a high confidence subnetwork as the paths that received at least 0.75 confidence over the ensemble.",

We first replaced the consensus MERLIN regulators with randomly drawn TFs and signaling proteins from the set that was provided as input to MERLIN, maintaining the degree distribution (in the background network) of the entire group. We also drew random replacements for the protein regulators from the input set of proteins. Then, for each module, we mapped the original pairs of MERLIN sources and sinks, and protein sources and MERLIN sinks, to their randomized counterparts, searched for paths to connect them, and assigned confidence values using the ILP approach as we did for the true predicted regulators.",

Each resulting background network consists of both directed (e.g., post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination) and undirected (e.g., binding) interactions. We then removed all interactions involving ubiquitin (UBB, UBC, UBD), SUMO (SUMO1-4), and 11 additional ubiquitin fusion proteins. These proteins are used as post-translational modifiers and are recorded as binding partners for large proportions of proteins in the background network. The ubiquitin and SUMO systems are still represented in the background network in the form of directed ubiquitination and sumoylation events between ligases and substrates.",

The red-blue heat map shows mean expression of all genes in each module for each sample, compared to mock treatment value (similar to Fig 2) . Blocks of columns are time series (in days) from different viruses and dosages (PFU: Particle forming units). Viruses are ordered from low to high pathogenicity; different dosages of the same virus are placed next to each other. The \"Genes\" column shows the size of each module; larger values are shown in darker blue. Under \"Enrichment\", a red box indicates module enrichment with any MSigDB motif, any curated gene set from Gene Ontology, KEGG, REACTOME or BioCarta (MSigDB curated gene sets), any influenza screen set, or any immune response gene set (described in Materials and Methods). Each column is a sample from one of the virus treatment time courses. Rows in each heatmap are genes in the intersection of the complete mRNA and protein data sets for one system after filtering out entries with >50% missing values; before filtering mRNA data set down to differentially expressed genes only. Genes are sorted by hierarchical clustering with average linkage, Manhattan distance followed by optimal leaf ordering of the mRNA data to enhance visualization of patterns.

A selection of sixteen human modules (grey, center), with their top predicted regulators (shapes on left, connected to modules), and enriched gene sets relevant to immune response or viral life cycle (colored boxes, right). Modules were included in this figure if they were enriched for one of the following categories: (a) influenza host genes (pink) identified by RNAi, protein-protein interactions, expert curation (Zhang et al. 2009), or enrichment for other virus life cycle gene sets (from GO or KEGG); (b)motifs (green) for transcriptional regulators whose annotations indicate relevance to the innate immune response; (c) innate immune response gene sets (blue) from experimental results or manual curation. One module, Cluster 1593, is also included because its consensus regulator set (but not targets) was enriched for host proteins that are involved in the influenza life cycle fromWatanabe et al (2014). Also shown are seventeen from two separate organisms, with the mouse lung system being significantly more complex and heterogeneous than the human cell line system.
