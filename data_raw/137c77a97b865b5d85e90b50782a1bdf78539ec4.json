Prospectively and retrospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens (n \u03ed 2,908) were evaluated by using the ePlex RP panel, with the bioM\u00e9rieux/BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire RP) as the comparator method. Discordance analysis was performed by using target-specific PCRs and bidirectional sequencing. The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by using reproducibility panels comprised of 6 pathogens. The overall agreement between the ePlex RP and BioFire RP results was \u03fe95% for all targets. Positive percent agreement with the BioFire RP result for viruses ranged from 85.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2% to 88.9%) to 95.1% (95% CI, 89.0% to 97.9%), while negative percent agreement values ranged from 99.5% (95% CI, 99.1% to 99.7%) to 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5% to 99.9%). Additional testing of discordant targets (12%; 349/2,908) confirmed the results of ePlex RP for 38% (131/349) of samples tested. Reproducibility was 100% for all targets tested, with the exception of adenovirus, for which reproducibilities were 91.6% at low virus concentrations and 100% at moderate virus concentrations. The ePlex RP panel offers a new, rapid, and sensitive \"sample-to-answer\" multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.",

            "text": "R espiratory tract infections are a significant contributor to the global burden of respiratory tract illnesses, with up to 4 million deaths worldwide in 2013 (1) . Several pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, can cause respiratory tract infections. As clinical presentations often overlap, identification of the underlying pathogen based solely on clinical criteria is challenging (2) . Even though most respiratory tract infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, many are treated, as shown in a recent study highlighting the increase in unnecessary antibiotic use in this group (3) . In other patient groups, including immunocompromised patients, elderly patients, and critically ill patients, complications from respiratory tract infections often occur, with poor outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality (4) (5) (6) . Thus, the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical for optimal patient care. Additionally, rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for the timely administration of antiviral therapy, when available, and the institution of contact and droplet precautions to prevent health care-associated transmission (7, 8) . Several instruments and multiplexed molecular panels are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. These methods differ based on several criteria, including the degree of multiplexing (4 to 22 targets), complexity of the method (moderate to high), throughput (low to high), and turnaround time (TAT) (\u03f31 h to 8 h) (9) . In general, performance characteristics of these multiplex panels are significantly better than those of conventional methods, including viral culture and antigen tests, and have replaced these methods in many laboratories. On the other hand, the increased cost of multiplexed molecular panels compared to the cost of conventional methods has raised questions on their cost/benefit ratio, particularly as many viral targets on these panels have no specific treatments. However, given their utility in the rapid diagnosis of infections (especially in immunocompromised patients), infection control and prevention practices, and antibiotic stewardship, the interest in multiplexed PCRs remains high.",

This finding may be explained by the large diversity of genotypes present within each of these groups of pathogens or the prevalence of these pathogens in the population tested. For adenovirus, the performance of diagnostic tests is particularly important for young children and immuno- compromised hosts. However, the detection of adenovirus can be challenging. In this study, ePlex RP detected more adenoviruses than did the BioFire RP. A recent report on the performance of BioFire RP v1.7 for the detection of adenovirus highlighted the decreased sensitivity of the assay for samples with low viral loads or those positive for species A, D, and F (14) . Although the ePlex RP panel detects 4 genotypes of coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63), results are reported without the genotyping information. There are currently no treatments for coronaviruses, and the utility of the genotyping information may lie in its value for epidemiological studies.

            "text": "A notable difference between the ePlex RP panel and the BioFire RP is the absence of Bordetella pertussis-Bordetella parapertussis targets among the bacterial targets. It is noteworthy that unlike other bacterial targets on the panel, infection with Bordetella pertussis-B. parapertussis has a relatively specific epidemiology, with higher incidences typically being reported for children less than 2 months old and, more recently, for unvaccinated populations or vaccinated patients with waning immunity (19) . Thus, exclusion from a highly multiplexed respiratory panel may be warranted. In addition, the utilization of the single-copy pertussis toxin promoter target (ptxP) in some multiplex panels has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of B. pertussis than PCR tests targeted to the multicopy IS481 insertion sequence (20) . As a result, when B. pertussis infection is suspected, an FDA-cleared B. pertussis molecular test may be more appropriate.",

In this study, coinfections were identified in 5.5% of samples, with human rhinovirus/enterovirus being the most common virus detected in coinfected specimens. The importance of detecting coinfections was highlighted in a recent study showing that viral-bacterial coinfection during severe CAP in adults resulted in a more complicated disease course and was associated with complications (21) . In other studies, human rhinoviruses were frequently detected in association with bacterial pathogens in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant population, suggesting that this commonly detected virus may be a significant cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (22, 23) .",

This supports single-shift (8 h) testing volumes ranging from 24 samples to 96 samples, with a TAT of less than 2 h and an HOT of less than 2 min, providing a flexible capacity for laboratories of all sizes.
