However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-\u00c5 crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We've also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a \"GST-like\" S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-\u03c3, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.",

Interestingly, some taxon-specific crystallins have been found to have structures that are related to cytosolic housekeeping enzymes 4,5 . How lens crystallins evolved from such housekeeping enzymes is a most important question and answers to this question will greatly help our understanding of protein function, folding, and stability 6 .",

Previous studies have led to a model that involves multiple gene duplications and exon shuffling to allow the evolution from GST to S-crystallin 4,7,8 and this process then creates a diverse and large family of S-crystallins. There are about ten, twenty four and four different S-crystallins in the lens of the squids, Nototodarus sloanii and Loligo opalescens, and Octopus vulgaris (the West Pacific octopus), respectively 7,13,14 . The cDNAs encoding these S-crystallins have nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 58% to 98%, while their proteins have identities ranging from 46% to 99% at the amino acid sequence level 7 . Among these proteins, \"short-loop\" S-crystallins (SL11, S4 and Cry9) are expressed less in the lens and are more GST-like, while \"long-loop\" S-crystallins",

Only one of them, named OctS4, could be expressed and purified to homogeneity. However, efforts to crystallize the wild-type OctS4 were unsuccessful. Therefore, we modified the wild-type sequence by creating a number of mutants that are believed to be related to the binding of GSH or of electrophilic compounds (Extended data Fig. 1) . After a significant number of trials, a highly active mutant, Q108F, was successfully expressed and crystallized in the presence of GSH. We determined the crystal structure of the S-crystallin Q108F mutant at 2.35 \u00c5 resolution ( Fig. 1 and Extended data Table 1 ). A monomer of S-crystallin forms an asymmetric unit within the crystal, and a dimer of the protein that is similar to GST can be generated using a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis ( Fig. 1a and Extended data Fig. 2a) . Approximately 1600 \u00c5 2 of the surface area of each monomer is buried in the interface of this dimer, comparing to 1300 \u00c5 2 for the squid GST-\u03c3 16 with 38% sequence identity to S-crystallin. Besides, the dimerization of S-crystallin and several of its mutants was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Extended data Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "The reported crystal structures of GST-\u03c3 are in complex with either 1-(S-glutathionyl)-2,4-dinitrobenzene (GSDNB) or S-(3-iodobenzyl) glutathione (GSBzI) 16 . In contrast to the above, we observed the presence of a GSH molecule within the active site of S-crystallin, located between the N-domain (\u03b2 A to \u03b1 3) and C-domain (\u03b1 4 to \u03b1 10) of the protein (Fig. 1b) . There is a disulfide-bond between the thiol group of the GSH and residue Cys112 of S-crystallin. In addition, there is a polar interaction network (Fig. 1c) that consists of the glutamyl group of GSH interacting with residues Arg14, Gln64, Ser65 and Tyr97, the cysteinyl group of GSH interacting with residue Met51 and the glycinyl group of GSH interacting with residues His49 and Gly110. The two domains of S-crystallin are closer compared to those of GST-\u03c3 in complex with GSDNB; although the r.m.s distance between equivalent C\u03b1 atoms of the two structures is 1.3 \u00c5 (Fig. 2a) . When their N-domains are superposed, a difference of 3.5\u00b0 can be seen in the orientation of their C-domains. Compared with the binding of GSH to S-crystallin, GSDNB has fewer hydrophilic interactions with GST-\u03c3 (Fig. 2b ). GSDNB has no interaction with residue Arg13 of GST-\u03c3 , which is equivalent to residue Arg14 of S-crystallin. In addition, due to the lack of a long loop between the \u03b1 4 and \u03b1 5 helices (residues 112 to 122), the glycinyl group of GSDNB does not interact with the C-domain of GST-\u03c3 , while its dinitrobenzyl group does have hydrophobic contact with Phe106. Similarly, the structure of GST-\u03c3 in complex with GSBzI indicates that the iodobenzyl ring of GSBzI is located in a hydrophobic pocket that consists of residues Phe98, Val102 and Phe106 (Extended data Fig. 3 ). Like other GSTs 17 , the different binding modes of the GSDNB and the GSBzI to GST-\u03c3 imply a more flexible active site that favors catalysis. In contrast, the equivalent residues in S-crystallin are Leu100, Met104 and Gln108, respectively (Fig. 2b ). These differences result in a collapsed pocket that may disfavor the binding of aromatic compounds. We characterized the GST activity levels of S-crystallin and its various mutants in order to evaluate the role of the above residues. Octopus GST-\u03c3 was purified from the digestive gland and then used as a standard for enzyme activity (Fig. 2c,d) . The GST catalytic activity (k cat ) of the wild-type S-crystallin is 0.24 s \u22121 , which is about the same to that of the S-crystallins purified from octopus lens 18 but only ~1/700, of that of GST-\u03c3 (it will be ~1/6000 if compared their catalytic efficiency by k cat /K m,CDNB ) ( Table 1) . Consistent with our structural observations, we found that the apparent binding affinity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to S-crystallin is lower than that with GST-\u03c3 , with an 8.3-fold increase in the K m,CDNB . By way of contrast, the apparent binding affinity of GSH with S-crystallin is significantly tighter than that with GST-\u03c3 , with a 43-fold decrease in K m,GSH .",

The K m,GSH of the L100F and M104V mutants of S-crystallin have 37-fold and 83-fold increases and are similar to that of GST-\u03c3 , while K m,CDNB of the M104V mutant shows a significant decrease and is almost identical to that of GST-\u03c3 (0.65 mM versus 0.47 mM). Interestingly, although the Q108F mutant of S-crystallin possesses the highest k cat among the three mutants, its K m,GSH is also very high and we were not able to estimate a reliable K m,CDNB due to unsaturated kinetic assays. This indicates that the mutation of Gln108 to Phe is beneficial for catalysis but is detrimental to the binding of the two substrates. These results suggest that, in order to obtain a more \"GST-like\" S-crystallin, no single mutant is suitable, but rather multiple mutations are necessary (see below).",

Indeed, the mutation of Asp101 to Ala or Asn resulted in a minor increase in k cat in parallel with a decrease in the K m,CDNB of S-crystallin; albeit a 13-fold to 87-fold increase in K m,GSH (Extended data Fig. 4c ,d and Extended data Table 3 ).

The GST activity of the various double, triple and quadruple mutants of S-crystallin was characterized in order to delineate their mutual effects ( Table 3 ). The results suggest that, compared with of those from the single mutants, all double and triple mutants of S-crystallin have comparable or even higher k cat values, while there were no significant differences in the K m with GSH or CDNB. Furthermore, the quadruple mutant of S-crystallin, L100F/ D101N/M104V/Q108F, had the lowest K m,CDNB (0.18 mM) and the highest K m,GSH . Although there was only a 23-fold increase in activity for some unknown reason, the catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m,CDNB ) has a 518-fold increase (Table 1) . Nevertheless, based on the switch in the two substrate-binding affinities (increased K m,GSH and decreased K m,CDNB ) and the significant recovery of GST activity and catalytic efficiency, the double mutant D101N/Q108F and the quadruple mutant of S-crystallin would seem to result in a GST-like S-crystallin that has recovered GST activity and probably a more flexible active site 17 . In addition, another double mutant of S-crystallin, D101A/Q108F, showed the highest enzymatic activity in these mutants, which is only a 7-fold lower than that of GST-\u03c3 (Extended data Table 3 ).",

Next we characterized the GST activities of the C112G and loop-deletion mutants of S-crystallin in order to evaluate the effect of these changes. Interestingly, the mutation of Cys112 to Gly did not influence the binding affinity of GSH to S-crystallin; although the GST activity of the mutant is 3-fold lower than that of the wild-type (Extended data Fig. 4a ,b and Extended data Table 3 ). This indicates that the disulfide bonding between S-crystallin and GSH is not essential for binding. This also helps to explain the observation that the equivalent residue in most other S-crystallins is a glycine 7,14 (Extended data Fig. 1 ).",

These features prompted us to make a mutant that consisted of the four key residues changed previously together with the loop deletion in order to generate a putative \"ancestral\" protein. However, other than the \u0394 loop/Q108F mutant of S-crystallin, the other mutations together with the loop deletion resulted in a low level of recovery of activity and poor binding affinity with GSH ( Fig. 2c ,d, Extended data Fig. 4g ,h and Extended data Table 3 ). Unlike the Q108F mutant alone form of the protein, the K m,CDNB of the \u0394 loop/Q108F mutant of S-crystallin can be precisely determined to be 1.9 mM. This suggests that existence of the long loop not only enhances the binding of GSH to S-crystallin but may interfere with the binding of electrophilic compounds.",

Interestingly, a long-loop S-crystallin (OctS4) shows a significant increase in apparent GSH binding affinity compared to that of GST-\u03c3 . To evaluate the possible biological significances of such strong GSH binding, the thermal stability of S-crystallin without or with GSH was determined using circular dichroism spectrometry (Fig. 3a,b) . In the presence of GSH, the melting temperature (T m ) of S-crystallin was higher by 7 \u00b0C than that of the protein in the absence of GSH (Table 2) . Again, the mutation of Cys112 to Gly did not influence the T m enhancement in the presence of GSH (Extended Data Fig. 5a ,d and Extended Data Table 4 ). This indicates that the disulfide bonding between S-crystallin and GSH is not essential for this protection. Furthermore, denaturant-induced aggregation of S-crystallin was also observed using light-scattering analysis (Fig. 3c) . Our results suggested that S-crystallin aggregation is prevented by the presence of GSH in a dose-dependent manner. By way of contrast, GST-\u03c3 showed only a 1.7 \u00b0C increase in T m in the presence of GSH; although the T m of the free GST-\u03c3 is higher than that of the free S-crystallin. It indicated that GSH may not benefit to stabilize the GST-\u03c3 . Differently, previous studies have suggested that GSH binding is required to stabilize GSTP1-1 and Plasmodium falciparum GST [23] [24] [25] .",

Interestingly, all animals have an abundance of reducing agents in the lens, including GSH (2-10 mM), in order to maintain the redox potential of the lens 28 . Traditionally, the high GSH content in lens is believed to protect free thiols, which allows the structural integrity and/or proper biological functioning of various enzymes to be maintained 28 . Aging or damaged lenses show a diminished size of GSH pool and accelerating cataract. Previous studies have suggested that glutathiolation of human gamma crystallin is able to enhance its degradation by a proteasome system 29 . Here our novel finding is that GSH can also be used as a ligand of S-crystallin in order to prevent its aggregation and possible cataract formation in the cephalopod lens. If we considered the situation of S-crystallin in the lens, it is important for this protein to capture GSH for as long as possible and to minimize its catalytic activity, otherwise the GSH will be released as a product conjugate. This is likely to be a driving force that provided the impetus for the ancestral protein to evolve in a manner that weaken its binding affinity for electrophilic compounds by mutating residues 100, 104 and 108 and that interferes with the formation of the intermediate complex by mutating residue 101. In addition, inserting the long loop between \u03b1 4 and \u03b1 5 helices is also able to enhance the binding of GSH while at the same time interfering with the binding of electrophilic compounds. We believe that these mutations may play crucial roles in the evolutionary trajectory of S-crystallin. Similarly, it has been previously reported that the old human GST, GSTT2-2, shows a low affinity for GSH, compared to the more recently evolved human Alpha, Mu, and Pi GSTs 17 . It is possible to speculate that GST and S-crystallin may be evolved from a common GST ancestor under the same evolutionary pressure, i.e. in the direction of a decrease in K m for GSH.",

Other than the Q108F mutant of S-crystallin, all the mutants that showed an increased K m or a recovery in activity were found to have a lower T m without GSH (Fig. 3a,b , Extended data Fig. 5 and Extended data Table 4 ). This suggests that the original residues and the insertion of the long loop of S-crystallin improve the stability of the protein. Furthermore, other than the L100F and D101N mutants of S-crystallin, all the other mutations were found to have lost the protective effect of GSH as there were no T m increases when GSH was present. Based on these findings, we concluded that the existence of the long loop and the collapse of the binding pocket are both required for S-crystallin to be able to be protected in terms of stability when GSH is present. Furthermore, the mutation of the residue 101 from Asn to Asp is able to increase the stability of S-crystallin and this occurs because of a strengthening of the GSH protection effect.",

            "text": "Another concern when deciphering the evolution of S-crystallin is whether we can find a orthologous S-crystallin that is close to ancestral protein, in other words, a \"molecular fossil\" 8 . There are many different kind of S-crystallins found in the cephalopod lens as a result of gene duplication and/or the recruitment of novel genes into this morphogenetic pathways 7, 14, 15 . Previous studies have suggested dividing S-crystallins into two groups, the short-loop group, which is less expressed and the long-loop group, which are the dominant forms of S-crystallin. Based on sequence alignment, the short-loop crystallins are considered to be the earliest descendants from the ancestral gene 7 . In the present studies, we have identified one long-loop S-crystallin, SL-18, that is different to the others because it preserves residues 100 and 101 as Phe and Asn, respectively (Extended data Fig. 1) . Actually, the short-loop S-crystallins (SL11, LopS4 and Cry9) from three species of squids also preserve the two residues 7,13,15 . We chose two mutants, \u0394 loop/L100F/D101N and L100F/D101N, and used these to mimic the short-loop and SL18 S-crystallins, respectively (Figs 2c,d and 3) . The long-loop deletion resulted in the loss of GSH protection and the ability to prevent aggregation (Table 2 and Fig. 3d) ; although the GST activity of short-loop mimic showed a 3.3-fold increase (Table 1 ). This slight increase in activity is compatible with the findings of previous studies wherein lysate containing expressed short-loop-crystallin showed minor GST activity 7 . On the other hand, the SL18 mimic protein showed significantly high GST activity (a 59-fold increase) as well as lower thermal stability and the inability to prevent aggregate (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3) . For the first time we have provided experimental evidence showing that a modern S-crystallin with high GST activity do exist and that this may be advantageous to help protect other proteins in cephalopod lens when GSH is present.",

Poorly diffracting crystals were grown in 0.5% PEG8000, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 6.8 and 1.65 M ammonium sulfate in 3 days and these were used for microseeding. Single crystals of a hexagonal shape and with dimensions of 0.15 mm were obtained in less than a week. All crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.",

The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL-2000 package 30 . The crystals belong to space group P6 4 The three different groups of S-crystallin are separated by the mutations at two residues F98 and N99 and by the insertion of a long loop between the \u03b1 4 and \u03b1 5 helices. Two other residues, V102 and F106, can be used to separate GST and the ancestral S-crystallin. With a longer \u03b1 4-\u03b1 5 loop and the four \"key\" mutations, major S-crystallins lose their GST activity but gain significantly increased GSH binding affinity. The binding of GSH to S-crystallin enhances its protein stability, which is beneficial for the life-span of the lens and the survival of cephalopods. According to previous studies 29 , there is between 2 mM and 10 mM GSH in animal lenses.",
