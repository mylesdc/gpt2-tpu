Built upon this hybrid ARIMA-SVMs models alike, this study goes further to extend them into the case of multistep-ahead prediction for air passengers traffic with the two most commonly used multistep-ahead prediction strategies, that is, iterated strategy and direct strategy. Additionally, the effectiveness of data preprocessing approaches, such as deseasonalization and detrending, is investigated and proofed along with the two strategies. Real data sets including four selected airlines' monthly series were collected to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empirical results demonstrate that the direct strategy performs better than iterative one in long term prediction case while iterative one performs better in the case of short term prediction. Furthermore, both deseasonalization and detrending can significantly improve the prediction accuracy for both strategies, indicating the necessity of data preprocessing. As such, this study contributes as a full reference to the planners from air transportation industries on how to tackle multistep-ahead prediction tasks in the implementation of either prediction strategy.",

Most of the prediction models abounded in the literature can mainly be classified into two categories, namely, econometric models (casual model) and time series models. In the econometrics community, traditional research has been focusing on the economic factors of the take-off and landing point, such as population, income, and price [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . It should be noted that most econometric models aimed to reveal the underlying relationship between air passengers traffic flow and selected variables such as geoeconomic and service-related factors. Due to the complexity of econometric modeling in variables selection, time series approach is a promising alternative in air passengers traffic prediction [6] . However, these traditional time series methods always do not work in practice. The main reason is that the underlying assumption of these traditional time series methods is linearity and they cannot capture the nonlinear patterns hidden and recognize the irregularity well. Recent research focuses on modeling time series with complex nonlinearity, dynamic variation, and high irregularity [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

As such, this hybrid approach can take full advantages of the unique strength of ARIMA and SVM models in linear and nonlinear modeling, respectively. However, an important point to note from the past studies mentioned above is their preoccupation with one-step-ahead forecasting rather than the multistep-ahead one. In one-step-ahead case, the predictor uses all or some of the observations to estimate a variable of interests for the time step immediately following the latest observation. However, it provides no information as to the long-term future behavior of air passengers traffic.",

The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed modeling framework is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of air passenger traffic considered, resulting in a more accuracy multistepahead prediction. The second contribution is to provide the first strong empirical evidence within the air passengers traffic literature on whether the superiority of ARIMA-SVMs modeling framework holds consistently in the case of multistep-ahead prediction.

Since the ARIMA model cannot capture the nonlinear structure of the data, the residuals of linear model will contain information about the nonlinearity.

However, this raises a major redundancy issue because the MI criterion does not account for the interdependency between candidate variables.

MAPE has the advantage of being scale-independent and so is frequently used to compare forecast performance across different datasets. Moreover, the MAPE also has the disadvantage that it puts a heavier penalty on positive errors than on negative errors. MASE has recently been suggested by Hyndman and Koehler [30] as a means of overcoming observation and errors around zero existing in some measures. The MASE has some features which are better than the SMAPE, which has been criticized for the fact that its treatment of positive and negative errors is not symmetric [31] .

For each prediction horizon ( = 1 and 24) and performance measure (i.e., MAPE, SMAPE, and MASE), we perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure to determine if there exists statistically significant difference among the eight models in out-ofsample forecasting. Then, to further identify the significant difference between any two models, the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test [33] is employed to compare all pairwise difference simultaneously. Note that Tukey HSD test is a post-hoc test; this means that a researcher should not perform Tukey HSD test unless the results of ANOVA are positive. A rank-based performance measure termed as multiple comparisons with the best (MCB) [34] is used to test whether some models perform significantly worse than the best model. [35] is employed for SVR modeling here. We select the Radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function in the prediction models. To determine the hyperparameters, namely, , , (in the case of RBF as the kernel function), the PSO algorithm is employed in the current study. Due to its simplicity and generality as no important modification was made for applying it to model selection, PSO has been recently established for parameter determination of SVR. In solving hyperparameter selection by the PSO, each particle is requested to represent a potential solution ( , , ). Fortunately, several empirical and theoretical studies have been performed about the parameters of PSO from which valuable information can be obtained [36] . In this study, the parameters are determined according to the recommendations in these studies and selected based on the prediction performance and computational time in a trial-error fashion. Through experiments, the parameter values of PSO are set as follows. Both the cognitive and interaction coefficients are set to 2. The swarm size and number of iterations are set to be 10 and 50, respectively. For monthly ARIMA estimation, the automatic model selection algorithm proposed by Hyndman and Khandakar and implemented in the R software package \"forecast\" 5 is used in this study. Based on these, we develop our proposed hybrid ARIMA-SVMs programs in Matlab, which is available upon request. Figure 3 shows the experimental procedure using the real time series. Each series is split into the estimation sample and the hold-out sample firstly. Then, the input selection and model selection for each series are conducted using aforementioned filter method, PSO algorithm, and fivefold cross-validation with iterated and direct strategies. Finally, the attained models are tested for hold-out samples, the measures MAPE \u210e , SMAPE \u210e , and MASE \u210e are computed for each prediction horizon \u210e (in our case \u210e = 1, 2, . . . , 24) over four time series. Furthermore, the modeling process for each series is repeated fifty times. Upon the termination of this loop, performance of the examined models with selected strategies at each prediction horizon is judged in terms of the mean, average by fifty, of the MAPE \u210e , SMAPE \u210e , and MASE \u210e . Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test procedures are used to determine if the means of performance measures are statistically different among the five models for each prediction horizon and dataset. If so, Tukey's honesty significant difference (HSD) tests [37] are then employed further to identify the significantly different prediction models in multiple pairwise comparisons at 0.05 significance level.",

Therefore, the optimal parameters of the hybrid model should be further researched.",

The hybrid ARIMA-SVMs prediction models have been established recently, which has present good performance in time series prediction. In this study, the hybrid ARIMA-SVMs has been employed in multistep-ahead prediction which is more complex and difficult than one-step-ahead. The contribution of this study is employing ARIMA-SVMs in multistep-ahead prediction; moreover, air passengers traffic data is used for this study and a large scale comparative study has been conducted for validation. Quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed with the air passengers traffic data on the basis of the several prediction accuracies. Experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ARIMA-SVMs modeling strategy for multistep-ahead time series prediction.",
