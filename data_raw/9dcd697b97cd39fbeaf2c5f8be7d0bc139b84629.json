Since then, a number of published cohort studies highlighted the variable clinical presentation of MERS, which ranges between minimal or no symptoms and severe, potentially fatal pneumonia that often complicates with multi-organ failure [2] [3] [4] [5] . The majority of MERS cases were reported from Saudi Arabia and were linked to healthcare outbreaks [6] . This is most likely related to the overcrowding in emergency departments, lack of diligent application of proper infection control practices, and effective nosocomial transmission [6, 7] . Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus has been shown to survive the longest in cold and dry environments similar to that of hospitals [8] . Consequently, health care workers (HCWs) were exposed and have been affected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [9] . Similar to the general population, their clinical presentations ranged from mild or asymptomatic to severe and sometimes fatal MERS [5] . Since the number of critically ill HCWs with MERS in different individual centers is small, adequate data on the impact of the disease in HCWs are lacking. Additionally, the impact of critical illness due to MERS on the long-term functional outcomes of surviving HCWs remains unknown. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill HCWs with MERS. Additionally, we aimed to assess the functional outcomes of surviving HCWs from MERS.",

Effective nosocomial transmission and consequent hospital outbreaks posed a major challenge on HCWs. A number of single center MERS cohort studies included affected HCWs [5, 13] . The numbers of included HCWs, however, in each of those studies are very few, and some of whom had minimal or no symptoms. This, to our knowledge, is the only multi-center cohort study of critically ill HCWs with MERS. Our study demonstrates that hospital mortality among critically ill HCWs with MERS was substantial [25% (8/32)], but lower that what has been reported in general ICU MERS patients. A recent published cohort of 330 confirmed critically ill MERS cases (inclusive of the current HCWs cases) demonstrated hospital mortality of 67% (223/330) [10] . This is probably related to the relatively younger age of the HCWs cohort compared to that of the general population MERS SARI cohort [median age (Q1, Q3) of 39 (32, 48) compared to 58 (44, 69)]. Additionally, HCWs were less likely to have comorbid conditions (34.4% compared to 80.3%). Advanced age has been consistently recognized as a risk factor for mortality in several MERS cohort studies [3, 5, 14] . Additionally, presence of comorbid conditions, particularly diabetes mellitus as well as renal failure has been shown to be significantly associated with mortality in confirmed MERS cases [5, 14] . Interestingly, none of the five HCWs who were known to have renal impairment at baseline survived. This is consistent with previous cohort studies where patients with renal failure, and patients who required hemodialysis have had a significantly increased mortality rate reaching 100% [5] . Immune dysregulation has been studied and documented in patients with chronic renal impairment and those with end stage renal diseases who Table 3 required hemodialysis [15] . Reduced T-cell quantity as well as helper T-cell responses to mitogen stimulation has been documented and in some studies linked to durations of hemodialysis and renal impairment [15, 16] . This immune dysfunction may therefore explain the witnessed increased mortality rates in MERS patients with chronic renal impairment. The noted increased use of ECMO in non-surviving HCW is probably reflective of the severity of respiratory failure where ECMO is used as a rescue therapy.",

Only one of the pregnancies resulted in intrauterine fetal demise. The remaining 3 pregnant HCWs survived. [17] There are no data however, on their long-term functional outcomes. Although the two pregnant women in our cohort have survived MERS, one HCW did indicate limitations in her physical ability after recovery from MERS, whereas the second was an expat who has left the country and was unreachable. It is therefore, not possible to conclude whether pregnancy correlates with MERS severity or poorer functional outcomes. In a case control study, pregnant women with confirmed SARS had more severe pneumonia and worse outcomes [18] . On the other hand, data were conflicting on whether outcomes of H1N1 pneumonia were worse in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women [19, 20] .",

A similar number (11/13) reported a change in their infection control practices in a shift towards increased compliance. Examples of those changes in practices consistently cited compliance to personal protective equipment when advised particularly when dealing with suspected or confirmed MERS cases. We selected Karnofsky Performance Scale to assess functional outcomes of surviving HCW from MERS. Having been originally developed by Karnofsky to assess the functional ability and prognosis in patients with malignancies, the elements included in the score assessed for physical ability to determine whether the tested individual is able to carry out normal activities without any reference to a specific oncologic diagnosis, size of a tumor or type of chemotherapy [11] . It therefore, has been used assess functional status of patients of other non-oncologic conditions. Compared to other quality of life models, KFS does not dwell into social, economical and spiritual factors, which are out of the scope and the purpose of this questionnaire which focuses on perceiving whether relatively young and healthy MERS SARI survivors could have long term physical effects of their illness [21] . Additionally, other tests such as physical performance test are designed to assess physical ability of elderly patients and scores are based on specific physical tests that the patient is required to perform which would not have been feasible in our setting [22] . While recall bias poses a possible study limitation for questions related to the exposure, it does not affect the answers to the functional assessment questions, which inquire about the status at the time of the questionnaire. In fact, persistence of fatigue or exertional shortness of breath over a year or longer after discharge highlights the seriousness of such symptoms. Indeed, the self-reported post recovery functional limitation in two previously healthy and young HCWs are very worrisome and warrants investigation. This is particularly true since HCWs were approached after a median of 580 days from hospital discharge. The fact that those HCW continued to experience persistent change in exercise capacity highlights an overlooked complication of MERS, and that death is not the only negative outcome in affected patients. A previous report highlighted similar concerns in SARS survivors [23] .",

Declining to answer a short questionnaire that may serve as a reminder of an unpleasant and a possibly traumatic experience may indicate unresolved stress or post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly that the reason behind this experience is directly related to their profession in health care. A previous report on HCWs with MERS highlighted the stress and negative feelings associated with the contracting the infection, however it was in a group of HCWs in a hospital during a nosocomial outbreak where no HCW died [24] . Previous reports of increased rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in HCWs, who were considered at high risk for contracting SARS illnesses, even in the absence of an actual infection, during the year that followed the SARS outbreak were published [25] . Our interpretation, however, remains speculative and a formal psychological assessment is needed.",

The lower mortality rates, younger age and fewer comorbidities in comparison to the general population are highlighted in this study. Nevertheless, MERS related mortality in HCWs remained substantial, particularly in HCWs with chronic renal impairment. This sheds a new light on a specifically high-risk group that should be offered special attention especially during clinical care assignment to suspected or confirmed MERS cases. Additionally, the often overlooked residual physical and emotional negative outcomes need to be systematically assessed and addressed in a timely manner by health care institutions. Failure to do so may negatively impact the working environment, which would affect quality of care provided to patients particularly during and after periods of outbreaks.",
