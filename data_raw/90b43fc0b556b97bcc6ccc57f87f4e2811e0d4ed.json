In this study, a reverse genetics approach was used to generate infectious BatIV particles entirely from plasmids encoding full-length sequences in eight gene segments. We inoculated BatIV particles into various cell cultures including bat-derived cell lines and found that BatIVs infected particular batderived cells efficiently but not the other cell lines tested. Reassortant viruses between the two BatIVs were also successfully generated and their replication in the susceptible bat cell lines was confirmed. These findings suggest a limited host range and reassortment potential of BatIVs in nature, providing fundamental information for understanding of the ecology of BatIVs.",

IAVs have 8 segmented negative-sense RNA genomes and are divided into subtypes based on combination of two viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). IAVs with H1-16 HA and N1-9 NA subtypes have been identified in wild aquatic birds, especially migratory ducks, the natural reservoir of IAVs 1-4 . Importantly, due to their propensity for genetic reassortment, a variety of IAV subtypes are distributed in many host species.",

Since the amino acid sequences of their HA and NA are distinct from those of all previously known IAV subtypes, these bat-derived influenza viruses (BatIVs) were provisionally designated H17N10 and H18N11. However, previous studies have reported that H17 HA does not bind to sialic acids linked to galactose in sugar chains 7 , which are known as canonical receptors of IAVs, and that N10 NA lacks neuraminidase activity 8 which is also a common property of all known influenza viruses. Thus, BatIV glycoproteins have also been called HA-like (HL) and NA-like (NL) (i.e., HL17NL10 and HL18NL11) 9 . However, information on the biological properties of these BatIVs is limited since infectious virus particles have never been isolated from infected animals.",

In a previous study, we screened various cell lines, including bat-derived cells, for their susceptibility to VSV pseudotyped with BatIV glycoproteins and found that the virus infected particular bat cell lines 15 . To confirm this tropism, BatIV particles produced from the transfected HEK293T cells were inoculated into various cultured cells (i.e., 1 avian and 11 mammalian cell lines including 8 that were derived from bats) ( Table 1 ) and the cells were stained for IFA. Among the bat-derived cell lines, the Miniopterus fuliginosus and Miniopterus schreibersii bat-derived lines (YubFKT2 and SuBK12-08 cells, respectively) showed susceptibility to BatIV. However, no infected cells were observed in the other mammalian and avian cell lines, including Vero E6, MDCK, and QT6. To quantify the infectivity of BatIV in each cell line, we calculated infectious units by counting the number of fluorescent cells and found that both H17N10 and H18N11 BatIVs showed similar preference profiles of infectivity (Fig. 4a,b) . Interestingly, YubFKT2 and SuBK12-08 cells showed susceptibility equivalent to or higher than MDCK II cells which have been reported to be susceptible to BatIVs ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) 17 .

HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids for reassortant viruses whose NA segments were swapped with each other (i.e., H17N11 and H18N10) and those having H17 HA and N10 NA segments with internal protein gene segments of H18N11 BatIV and vice versa. We confirmed that all these reassortant viruses were successfully generated and efficiently infected YubFKT2 cells (Fig. 5 ).",

However, some previous studies could only investigate reassortant viruses containing BatIV internal protein gene segments and HA/NA gene segments of well-characterized IAVs and failed to generate wild-type BatIVs, most likely due to the strict host cell specificity (i.e., receptor usage) for propagation of BatIVs 18, 19 . Recently, one research group confirmed the rescue of infectious BatIV with its whole gene segments using the cell line MDCK II which originated from highly passaged MDCK cells and has different properties from the parent cell line commonly used for IAV propagation 17 . In this study, we demonstrated the generation of infectious BatIVs and their reassortants using HEK293T cells. Consistent with the previous study 17 , BatIV proteins were newly synthesized in plasmid-transfected HEK293T cells, indicating that the BatIV ribonucleoprotein complex worked in human kidney cells, leading to the production of progeny virus particles. Interestingly, we found two morphologically different viral particles in the supernatant of the transfected cells. It is known that virions of IAVs isolated from clinical specimens often have spherical and filamentous shapes 20 . However, it is unclear whether the infectious potential of BatIVs depends on the morphological differences of virions. Further studies are required to clarify the relation between virion morphology and viral infectivity.",

This is the first report of reassortants generated between the two BatIVs that have been discovered so far, indicating that these BatIVs share their 18, 19 . Although BatIV segments have almost identical sequences at the extreme 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, these attempts failed to generate reassortant viruses. However, BatIV-based chimeric viruses whose HA and NA segments have the BatIV non-coding region with adjacent parts of the coding region of well-characterized H1 and H7 HAs were generated in previous studies 18, 19 . It was also suggested that the failure of BatIV reassortants with other known IAVs was due to the incompatibility of NP and genomic segments 22 . This evidence implied that the non-coding region and adjacent parts of the coding region might also play critical roles in genome packaging in BatIVs. Taken together, our results suggest the potential for reassortment among BatIVs in nature, though there may be little possibility that BatIVs generate reassortant viruses with avian and mammalian IAVs. In this study, cells were inoculated with BatIVs from an apical direction. A previous study reported that BatIVs infected preferentially at the basolateral membrane of MDCK II cells 17 . In this study, since BatIV particles were inoculated into sub-confluent cells, it might be possible that infection was initiated at basolateral side, especially 15 . It has been reported that HAs of BatIVs do not recognize sialic acids, which are known as the receptor molecules of other known IAVs 23 . In addition, crystal structure analysis of BatIV HAs revealed that the receptor binding pocket of BatIV HAs is smaller than those of the other IAVs examined 23, 24 . Although the receptor molecules of BatIVs are still unknown, a previous study indicated that BatIV receptor(s) may be a certain glycoprotein shared by some particular bat species 15 .",

HEK293T cells (4.0 \u00d7 10 5 ) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with eight Pol-I plasmids (0.1 \u03bcg for each segment) and four protein expression plasmids (1.0 \u03bcg for PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio LLC) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Supernatants of the transfected cells were harvested at 48 hours post-transfection and were centrifuged through a 25% sucrose cushion (28,000 rpm, 2 hours, 4 \u00b0C). Concentrated (200X) virus particles were treated with 5.0 \u03bcg/ml trypsin for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C and then inoculated into YubFKT2 and other cells seeded on 6-well plates.",
