The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications.

In recent years, applications of NGS technologies in clinical diagnostics have been on the rise 1 FDA Complete List of Donor Screening Assays for Infectious Agents and HIV Diagnostic Assays (Accessed March 05, 2016) .

(Barzon et al., 2011; Byron et al., 2016) . Amongst the various NGS technologies, whole-transcriptome sequencing, also called RNA-seq, has been very popular with methods and tools being actively developed. Exploring the genome using RNA-seq gives a different insight than looking at the DNA since the RNA-seq would have captured actively transcribed regions. Every aspect of data output from this technology is now being used for research, including detection of viruses and bacteria (Khoury et al., 2013; Salyakina and Tsinoremas, 2013; Wang et al., 2016) . They are also independent of prior sequence information, and require less starting material compared to conventional cloning based methods, making them powerful and exciting new technologies in virology (Datta et al., 2015) . These high throughput technologies give us direct evidence of infection in the tissue as compared to ELISA-based assays, which only proves presence of infection somewhere in the human body. RNA-seq technology has hence enabled the exploration and detection of viral infections in human tumor samples. This technology also enables detection of variants in viral genome, which have been connected to clinical outcome (Moyes et al., 2005; Downey et al., 2015) .",

Our in-house algorithm used region-based information from the general-feature-format (GFF) files 5 of each viral genome, and the reads from the BAM file. It created a summary file, which had a total count of reads within or on the boundary of each region in the GFF file. This is repeated for each sample and for each viral GFF file. At the end, a matrix is obtained where the features (rows) are regions from the GFF file, and the columns are samples. The read count output from Module 3 (viral gene expression module) allowed for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups.

Studies have shown that this envelope protein mediates infections of cells (Robinson and Whelan, 2016) . HERV K113 is a provirus and is capable of producing intact viral particles (Boller et al., 2008) . Studies have shown a strong association between HERV-K antibodies and clinical manifestation of disease and therapeutic response (Moyes et al., 2005; Downey et al., 2015) . It is hypothesized that retroviral gene products can be \"reawakened\" when genetic damage occurs through mutations, frameshifts and chromosome breaks. Even though the direct oncogenic effects of HERVs in cancer are yet to be completely understood, it has shown potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and for immunotherapeutic purposes including vaccines (Downey et al., 2015) .",
