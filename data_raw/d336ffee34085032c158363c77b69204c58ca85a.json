The ability of bats to remain asymptomatic to viral infection may be due to the rapid control of viral replication very early in the immune response through innate antiviral mechanisms. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) represent the first line of defence against viral infection in mammals, with both families of IFNs present in pteropid bats. To obtain further insight into the type III IFN system in bats, we describe the characterization of the type III IFN receptor (IFNlR) in the black flying fox, P. alecto with the characterization of IFNlR1 and IL10R2 genes that make up the type III IFN receptor complex. The bat IFNlR complex has a wide tissue distribution and at the cellular level, both epithelial and immune cells are responsive to IFN-l treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bat IFNlR1 chain acts as a functional receptor. To our knowledge, this report represents the first description of an IFN receptor in any species of bat. The responsiveness of bat cells to IFN-l support a role for the type III IFN system by epithelial and immune cells in bats.",

IFNs play an essential role in the induction of an antiviral state and contribute to the initiation of the adaptive immune response. The type I IFNs (including IFN-a and IFN-b) are well known for their induction and potent antiviral activity directly in response to viral infection. More recently, a family of IFNs named type III IFNs (also known as IL28/29 or IFN-ls) were discovered in the human genome based on their similarity to type I IFN and IL-10 family members [1, 2] . Type I and III IFNs have similar antiviral activity, are produced by common pathways and result in the production of an overlapping repertoire of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [3] [4] [5] . Despite their similarities, type I and III IFNs signal through distinct IFN receptor (IFNR) complexes and display differences in their tissue and cellular distribution patterns consistent with each IFN family playing a distinct role in the immune response to viral infections.",

The IFNlR1 chain serves as a unique subunit of the type III receptor complex and is critical to the specificity of ligand binding [5] . In contrast, IL10R2 also forms part of the receptor complex of several members of the IL-10 cytokine family, including IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26 [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Unlike the ubiquitously expressed type I IFNR complex, the type III IFNR has a more restricted tissue distribution pattern. Although the IL10R2 chain is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells, the expression of the IFNlR1 varies widely between different organs and at the cellular level is restricted to epithelial cells [5, [12] [13] [14] . This expression pattern may reflect a role for type III IFNs in antiviral activity at the major portals of viral entry, providing a mechanism to inhibit viral replication prior to the activation of other components of the immune system. Although a high expression of IFNlR1 has also been detected in a variety of human and mouse immune cells, only mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to respond to IFN-l [5, 12, 13, 15, 16] .",

Although the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood, the co-evolution of bats with viruses may have resulted in the evolution of novel mechanisms for the control of viral replication. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats, we are using the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto as a model species for examining antiviral immunity in bats [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Bat IFN-l2 also demonstrates significant antiviral activity in vitro [21] . As the biological activity of cytokines is mediated through binding to specific receptor complexes, information on cellular responses to cytokines provides important clues to biological function. Towards a better understanding of the bat type III IFN system, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of IFNlR1 and IL10R2 encoding the type III IFNR complex from P. alecto. Our results demonstrate that IFNlR1 has a wide tissue distribution with epithelial cells and immune cells responsive to IFN-l in pteropid bats.",

Previously identified immune genes from P. alecto and P. vampyrus including IFNs and TLRs have a high sequence similarity to each other [20, 21] . IFN-l 2 genes for example, share 98% nucleotide identity between the two species. In view of the high sequence similarity between genes previously identified in P. vampyrus and P. alecto [20, 21] , IFNlR sequences from P. vampyrus were used to design oligonucleotide primers to amplify full length cDNAs from P. alecto. RACE PCR was performed on RNA extracted from the bat lung cell line, PaLuT02, three hours following stimulation with polyI:C [21] . As soluble variants of IFNlR1 and IL10R2 have been identified in other species, RT-PCR was also performed on P. alecto spleen and thymus RNA, however, no additional isoforms were identified. Alignment of cDNA sequences with the P. vampyrus genome and genes from the other species available in the GenBank database, revealed the presence of a single form of IFNlR1 and IL10R2 in P. alecto.

In humans, the IFNlR1 chain is unique to the IFNlR complex and has substantially higher ligand affinity than the IL10R2 chain [3, 6, 7, 14] . We therefore focused on IFNlR1 to obtain information specific to the IFN-l response. Bat primary cells, including five non-hematopoietic cell lines derived from kidney, small intestine, brain, liver and lung were examined for their response to recombinant bat IFN-l2 [21] . As shown in Figure 4 , there is a correlation between the expression of IFNlR1 (Fig. 4A ) and the induction of the two ISGs tested, RIG-I (Fig. 4B) and ISG56 (Fig. 4C) following IFN-l stimulation. Liver, lung and small intestine which have relatively higher IFNlR1 expression show correspondingly high ISGs induction. In contrast, kidney and brain responded poorly to IFN-l, due to their low IFNlR1 expression. The bat primary cell lines consist of a mixed population of adherent tissue cell types and are not a direct reflection of the original tissue they were derived from. In humans, the IFNlR1 expression among non-hematopoietic cells is restricted to epithelial cells [5] . To determine whether a similar pattern exists in bats we used a cross-specific epithelial cell marker (anti-cytokeratin) to determine the proportion of epithelial cells in each cell line population. The Western blot shown in Figure 4D illustrates the relative proportion of epithelial cells in each cell line population and demonstrates a correlation between the proportion of epithelial cells within the cell line populations, their IFNlR1 expression and ISGs production (Fig. 4) .",

The two splice variants of human IFNlR1 have been speculated to negatively regulate IL-28/IL-29 signalling as a result of IFN-l binding to the soluble IFNlR1 receptor prior to cell contact, and due to the truncated IFNlR1 acting as a dominant negative receptor chain. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of the presence of additional IFNlR1 splice variants in P. alecto, the absence of such variants with the ability to downregulate the IFN-l response may lead to a more pronounced IFN response in bat cells.",

In mice, IFNlR1 is expressed predominantly in stomach, small intestine and skin and is expressed at very low levels in the central nervous system and spleen [13, 16, 25] . Our results demonstrate a ubiquitous IFNlR1 expression pattern in all tissues tested in P. alecto, however, similar to humans and Xenopus, considerable variation exits between tissues with small intestine and spleen having relatively higher expression of IFNlR1 compared to other organs. The transcription of P. alecto IL10R2 was comparable to humans [25] , with a ubiquitous expression among all tissues tested. Interestingly, the three hematopoietic organs tested, PBMC, spleen and lymph nodes displayed the highest IL10R2 expression likely reflecting its role as a receptor for a number of cytokines.

In humans and mice, IFNlR1 appears to be restricted to epithelial cells [12, 13] . To determine whether a similar situation exists in bats, we used a number of primary cell lines derived from different P. alecto organs and examined their IFNlR1 expression and response to IFN-l stimulation. Our results demonstrate a clear relationship between IFNlR1 expression and response to IFN-l stimulation. In addition, this pattern correlated with the proportion of epithelial cells in the selected bat cell lines. The restricted expression pattern of IFNlR1 in non-haematopoietic cells is similar to other species and is consistent with a role for IFNl in contributing to the elimination of viruses at the major portals of entry into the body before infection is established.",

Bat spleen cells displayed a high IFNlR1 expression and responded to IFN-l treatment with the induction of RIG-I and ISG56. However, a higher IFNlR1 expression by bat splenocytes compared with the non-hematopoietic cell lines did not correspond to a higher induction of ISGs. In mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the only immune cells that express the IFNlR1 and these cells are also responsive to IFN-l stimulation [16] . Human immune cells including B, T and NK cells express high levels of IFNlR1 mRNA, and PBMCs have membrane bound IFNlR1, however, they show little response to stimulation with IFN-l [12] . Our results are consistent with the presence of a population of bat splenocytes that are sensitive to IFN-l. However, in the absence of specific cell markers to characterize bat immune cells we are unable to determine which populations of cells express IFNlR1 and respond to IFN-l. Characterization of the immune cell types capable of responding to IFN-l during viral infection will provide further insights into the role of IFN-l in antiviral immunity in bats.",
