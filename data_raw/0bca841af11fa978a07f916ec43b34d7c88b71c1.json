            "text": "Cell surface glycoconjugates present alterations of their structures in chronic diseases and distinct oligosaccharide epitopes have been associated with cancer. Among them, truncated glycans present terminal non-reducing \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues that are rare on healthy tissues. Lectins from unconventional sources such as fungi or algi provide novel markers that bind specifically to such epitopes, but their availability may be challenging. A GlcNAc-binding lectin from the fruiting body of the fungus Psathyrella velutina (PVL) has been produced in good yield in bacterial culture. A strong specificity for terminal GlcNAc residues was evidenced by glycan array. Affinity values obtained by microcalorimetry and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated a micromolar affinity for GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal epitopes and for biantennary N-glycans with GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man capped branches. Crystal structure of PVL complexed with GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal established the structural basis of the specificity. Labeling of several types of cancer cells and use of inhibitors of glycan metabolism indicated that rPVL binds to terminal GlcNAc but also to sialic acid (Neu5Ac). Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression confirmed the higher amount of GlcNAc present on cancer cells. rPVL binding is specific to cancer tissue and weak or no labeling is observed for healthy ones, except for stomach glands that present unique \u03b1GlcNAc-presenting mucins. In lung, breast and colon carcinomas, a clear delineation could be observed between cancer regions and surrounding healthy tissues. PVL is therefore a useful tool for labeling agalacto-glycans in cancer or other diseases.",

Because of multivalency effect, the signal was maximal for multiantennary structures (2 to 5 antenna) with lactosamine repeats, the occurrence of which is related to cancer progression [27] . Polylactosamine bi-or multi-antennary N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal were bound with fluorescence signals higher than 1500 RU, while the ones with terminal Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc are in the background noise, below 150 RU. No binding is observed to the GlcNAc\u03b21-4Man motif present in bisected N-glycans, but the presence of this bisecting GlcNAc does not hinder the binding of PVL to neighboring GlcNAc-terminated antenna. The lectin also bound to mucin motifs that bear \u03b2GlcNAc on position 3 and 6 of a GalNAc residue (type 4). It bound only weakly to the chitobiose motif (GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc) of chitin. The lectin is not selective for the anomeric configuration of the GlcNAc and several oligosaccharides with terminal \u03b1GlcNAc residues were also labeled. Such epitopes are present in human heparan sulfate (GlcNAc \u03b11-4IdoA) and in mucins of gastric glands (GlcNAc \u03b11-4Gal) [5] , but also in class III mucin of carcinoma tissues that express a gastric phenotype [28] . The glycan array contains a variety of oligosaccharides with terminal GalNAc but PVL binding was observed only to the disaccharide GalNAc\u03b21-3GalNAc (#97) with minor intensity.",

The affinity for GlcNAc is in the same range as that previously measured by ITC with native PVL isolated from mushroom (Kd %200 \u03bcM) [13] . Quantitative measurements confirmed a stronger affinity for GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal-terminated structures than for GlcNAc and chitooligosaccharides, with dissociation constant of about 70 \u03bcM for the trisaccharide lacto-N-triose. A good agreement was observed between values measured by both methods. Only the N-glycan heptasaccharide presenting two terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man epitopes showed stronger affinity for rPVL in solution (Kd of 34 \u03bcM) than on SPR chip. This may be due to the bivalent character of this particular interaction that may be more easily established with the protein in solution than fixed on a chip. The binding of both terminal GlcNAc residues of the biantennary heptasaccharide was confirmed by comparing the stoichiometry of linear GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal (five ligands per rPVL) and of biantennary heptasaccharide (two ligands per rPVL). The thermodynamics of binding was also different since the biantennary glycan is the only one to present a favorable entropy of binding (Table 1) , that could be explained by the preorientation of the two GlcNAc residues in space.",

Since the glycan microarray showed some binding to Neu5Ac containing glycans, sialidase treatment was performed in order to determine if Neu5Ac-terminated cell surface glycans could be recognized by the lectin. As shown on Fig 4A, following sialidase treatment, cell staining was almost completely lost for the HBEC-3KT cell line, but much less so for other cell lines such as MCF-7 or A549.

As a control for specificity, 2F-fucose, an inhibitor of fucosyltransferases was used (Fig 5A) . The latter compound did not affect binding of either the Neu5Ac-specific lectin MAH or of rPVL. By contrast, 3F-Neu5Ac, decreased MAH binding by 75%, as expected, but also rPVL binding by 59%, indicating that a significant level of rPVL binding to these cells is due to recognition of Neu5Ac epitopes. Treatment of A549 cells by an exo \u00df-D-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase also resulted in a major decrease of rPVL binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GlcNAc-terminated glycans are also recognized by rPVL on this cell line. To further delineate which type of glycans are involved, A549 cells were treated with kifunensin, an inhibitor of N-glycan maturation, with benzyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor of O-glycosylation and with PPMP, an inhibitor of glycolipid synthesis (Fig 5B) . Treatment by all three inhibitors resulted in a decrease of the MAH Neu5Ac-specific lectin, indicating that Neu5Ac termini are present on these three major types of glycans. Likewise, each inhibitor decreased rPVL binding to some extent. Yet, inhibition of rPVL binding was much clearer following benzyl-GalNAc treatment than following the other treatments.

As shown on Fig 7A a strong labeling, inhibited in the presence of GlcNAc, was observed on colon carcinomas, whilst a weak labeling was only found on the adjacent normal tissue. To determine if the staining of carcinoma cells was dependent on either Neu5Ac or GlcNAc-terminated glycans, tissue sections of canine breast carcinoma were treated with either sialidase or exo-\u00df-D-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase prior to incubation with the biotinylated lectin (Fig 7B) . Canine breast carcinoma sections were used since they were more easily available than human breast carcinoma sections and since the tumors are remarkably homologous to their human counterparts [32] . Both enzyme treatments led to a clear reduction of the staining, indicating that similar to what was observed on cell lines, both Neu5Ac and GlcNAc were involved in the lectin staining.",
