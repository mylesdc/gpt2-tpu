In this study, we demonstrate the synergistic stimulation of CXCL10 mRNA and protein, a key chemokine responsible for the early immune response to viral infection, following treatment of airway epithelial cells with IFN c and influenza virus. The synergism also occurred when the cells were treated with IFN c and a viral replication mimicker (dsRNA) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the requirement of type I interferon (IFNAR) signaling in dsRNA-induced CXCL10, the synergism was independent of the IFNAR pathway since it wasn't affected by the addition of a neutralizing IFNAR antibody or the complete lack of IFNAR expression. Furthermore, the same synergistic effect was also observed when a CXCL10 promoter reporter was examined. Although the responsive promoter region contains both ISRE and NFkB sites, western blot analysis indicated that the combined treatment of IFN c and dsRNA significantly augmented NFkB but not STAT1 activation as compared to the single treatment. Therefore, we conclude that IFN c and dsRNA act in concert to potentiate CXCL10 expression in airway epithelial cells via an NFkB-dependent but IFNAR-STAT independent pathway and it is at least partly regulated at the transcriptional level.",

Interestingly, synergistic induction of CXCL10 has been described with IFN c in conjunction with HIV-1 in human astrocytes and macrophages and thought to play a role in HIV induced encephalopathy [14, 15] . This marked variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that elicit a synergistic response of CXCL10 in a wide variety of cell types is indicative of a highly conserved and likely biologically important cellular response.

We further demonstrate that this synergy was mediated by the interaction between dsRNA (an intermediate of viral replication) and IFN c in vitro and in vivo. In the follow-up mechanistic study, this synergism was found to be transcriptionally regulated as demonstrated by a chimeric promoter reporter gene assay. In addition, it was not dependent of the IFNAR pathway as neither the neutralizing antibody to IFNAR nor the IFNAR deficiency affected the synergism.

They were sent to us with arbitrary numerical code. No identity link to the actual patient can be identified. Protease-dissociated HBE cells were plated on TranswellH chambers (Corning) and were maintained in immersed culture conditions until they reached confluence when they were transferred to an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture condition [16, 17] . At air-liquid interface, the cells were maintained in a Ham's F12/DMEM (1:1) with the addition of transferrin (5 mg/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 mM), bovine hypothalamus extract (15 mg/ml), BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and all-transretinoic acid (30 nM). Cells were maintained at ALI for 7 days and were placed in basal media devoid of the additives, with the exception of retinoic acid, overnight prior to the experiments. Recombinant IFN c was purchased from R&D Systems and synthetic double stranded (ds) RNA (i.e. poly I:C) from EMD Biosciences. IFN c was used at 50 ng/ml and poly I:C at 25 mg/ ml. A neutralizing antibody to IFNAR was obtained from US Biologics and used at 2.5 mg/ml [18] . Both IkB kinase and JAK inhibitors were purchased from EMD Biosciences and used at 5 mM.

The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Early differentiated HBE cells (7 days) were transfected with CXCL10 promoter-luciferase construct and pRL-TK using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. pRL-TK was used as the internal control for normalizing transfection efficiency. The empty vector, pGL3 basic was used as a negative control. In brief, cells were plated onto 12 well plates at 80-90% confluency. The next day, cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) before transfection. The cells were incubated at 37uC with the mixture of DNA constructs and Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM for 5-6 hours at which time cell culture media was also added to the cells. Transfected cultures were treated with 50 ng/ml IFN c and/or 25 mg poly I:C for 24 hours. A dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) was used following the manufacturer's protocol. For each transfection, the relative firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the renilla luciferase activity.",

In this study, we seek to understand the modulation of an important chemokine-CXCL10 by the combined effects of IFN c and viral infection. This is the first report documenting the observation and mechanism underlying the synergism between IFN c and viral infection (or dsRNA treatment) in airway epithelial cells. IFN c is a type II interferon and oftentimes elevated in the context of viral infection. It is generally accepted that direct innate antiviral defense is mediated by type I IFN. Indeed, we and others have shown that dsRNA (or virus)-induced epithelial derived type I IFN plays critical role in the airway antiviral defense [16, 21, 22] . In the present study, we demonstrate the synergy between dsRNA-and IFN c-induced signaling in the regulation of CXCL10. Interestingly, although dsRNA-induced CXCL10 depended on type I IFN pathway, the synergy between dsRNA and IFN c was completely independent of it in both human and mouse epithelial cells. This lack of dependence was not due to the remaining residue of the IFNAR functionality in the antibody neutralization assay, because the epithelial cells from IFNAR deficient mice used in the Fig. 4A still preserved the synergistic response despite the loss of entire IFNAR expression. Thus, in the presence of IFN c, dsRNA (or virus)-induced signaling is very likely to be altered, which emphasizes the importance of studying the pathway crosstalk as demonstrated in the present study.",

Several of these studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor, NF-kB, is involved in CXCL10 induction in a variety of systems [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, very few studies have demonstrated that CXCL10 induction is dependent on an ISRE site in the promoter region. Kanda and coworkers found substance P and IFN c induced synergism of CXCL10 in human keratinocytes was dependent on an ISRE site and two NF-kB sites in the CXCL10 promoter located 2210 to 2 221 of the transcription start site [12] . In addition, Majumder and co-workers found evidence that IFN c and TNF a act in synergy via p48 complexes with STAT-1a binding to this same ISRE site in the CXCL10 promoter of human fibrosarcoma lines [23] . Evidence that similar synergism occurs at the transcriptional level in mouse cells has been demonstrated in a small number of in vitro studies [13, 24] . Using the murine fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line, Ohmoir and co-workers established that an ISRE site and one of two NF-kB sites in a 243 bp fragment flanking the transcription start site of the murine CXCL10 gene were critical for IFN c and TNF a induced synergy [24] . Our study has further extended these studies to the airway epithelial system in the context of viral infection, and the results apparently support the importance of NFkB. Figure 6 . NFkB-dependent signaling is responsible for the synergism between IFN c and dsRNA (dsR).

CXCL10 secretion by HBE cells appeared to be polarized. The treatment with IFN c, dsRNA and combined treatments resulted in a progressively enhanced secretion of CXCL10 mainly from apical surface. In contrast, the basal secretions of CXCL10 protein in these cultures were much less. The gradient between the apical and basal compartments may have important implications in vivo leading to enhanced emigration of CXCR3 positive effector cells (primarily CD8+ T cells) to the airway epithelial microenvironment.",

While dsRNA was used in this study to simulate a viral infection, it is important to note that it, in and of itself, can also be involved in synergistic induction of CXCL10 in airway epithelial cells. This fact could be an important consideration in the treatment of patients with pre-existing diseases in which IFN c is part of the pathogenesis such as viral infections.",

This synergism is likely to be mediated by dsRNA-induced signaling both in vitro and in vivo, which is independent of the type I interferon receptor pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate the 735 bp proximal region of the CXCL10 promoter plays a critical role in regulating this synergistic induction. This region of the CXCL10 promoter contains punitive ISRE and NFkB transcription factor binding sites. Therefore, further study has been carried out to demonstrate the involvement of NFkB, but not STAT1, in this synergism. This capacity for airway epithelial cells to markedly up-regulate CXCL10 likely has important consequences for CD8+ T cell and NK cell migration to the airway epithelial microenvironment following influenza virus infection.",
