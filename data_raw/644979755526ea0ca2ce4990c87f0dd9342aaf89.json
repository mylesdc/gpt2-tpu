We developed a highly efficient pseudovirus production system capable of yielding 100 times more rabies pseudovirus than the traditional method. Employing the high-titer pseudoviruses, we have developed robust in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays for the evaluation of rabies vaccine, which traditionally relies on livevirus based assays. Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility. Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay. Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain. Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity.",

Although a lethal disease, rabies could be effectively prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen. Specifically, prompt administration of vaccines in conjunction with rabies-immunoglobulins and proper wound management after exposure prevent rabies even after high-risk exposure 4,5 . Animal studies have demonstrated that rabies-specific antibodies, especially the neutralizing antibodies, played an essential role in vaccine-mediated protection 6 . Yet, clinical evaluation of rabies vaccines in humans is not possible due to ethical considerations. Therefore, new rabies vaccines or rabies-specific immunoglobulins must be evaluated for their potency by in vitro and in vivo assays prior to being authorized for human use 7 .",

In a virus or pseudovirus, the capsid encapsulating the RNA genome is the \"core\" while the outer membrane functions as the \"envelope\", which determines the tropism of the virus or pseudovirus. Pseudoviruses have been successfully used in the studies of a variety of enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus 16 , Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus 17 , hepatitis C virus 18 , influenza virus 19 . However, technical challenges have been encountered by investigators in making high-titer pseudoviruses. Specifically, pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors with RABV glycoprotein G has been explored in experimental gene therapy against neurological disorders [20] [21] [22] and determination of neutralizing antibody 23, 24 ; however, low transduction efficiency associated with the glycoprotein G pseudotyped virus substantially hinders its wider applications 25, 26 . This is especially true for in vivo animal studies, in which no rabies pseudovirus has been reported. While it is likely that chimeric glycoproteins with VSV-G could partially resolve transduction issue 27 , the use of chimeric glycoprotein would compromise the application of such pseudovirus to the analyses of neutralizing antibody targeting the envelope of the wild type virus. Clearly, novel approaches should be explored to circumvent these technical difficulties.",

We demonstrated here that the pseudovirus-based assays are superior to the current assays in terms of reproducibility, and safety. The turn-around time for the pseudovirus in vivo assay was shorter than the original virus assay. The optimization of the procedure reported here could greatly facilitate development of similar assays to replace other highly pathogenic enveloped viruses for the assessment of wider range of vaccines and gene therapy products.",

Pseudovirus is much safer because the virus is essentially devoid of virulent viral components and involves in a single round of replication. Yet, the biggest drawback of pseudovirus system is that the harvested viruses are often of very low titers, substantially limiting their applications, particularly for in vivo studies.

Given that spleen and liver are the major organs clearing particles in blood circulation, the biodistribution pattern of the rabies pseudovirus administered intravenously is expectedly to be different from that of the wt virus model in which the virus is given intramuscularly 32 ; in the latter case, the rabies virus reaches the CNS by retrograde transport route, followed by spreading centrifugally along the autonomic and sensory nerves to the peripheral organs 32 . In our pseudovirus model, the bioluminescence was found in brain by 72 hours, a time at which the signal density began to decline in spleen and liver, suggesting that the pseudovirus maintains neurotropic property. Nevertheless, as the spleen is known to be the biggest reservoir for monocytes that outnumbered those in circulation and both human and mouse monocytes are susceptible to rabies viral infection 33 , this could also explain the strong luminescence signal in the spleen. As expected, after we intracerebrally injected the animals with pseudovirus, the bioluminescent signal was initially found to be mainly localized in the brain, followed by re-distribution into the spleen and liver, which is a biodistribution pattern similar to that of the live wt virus given intracerebrally (data not shown). Therefore, the difference in viral biodistribution is largely due to route of administration.

Forty-eight hours post transfection, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45-\u03bc m pore size) and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0C or lower in 1-ml aliquots until use. 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of each rabies pseudovirus batch was determined using a single-use aliquot from the pseudovirus bank; all stock was used only once to avoid inconsistence which could have resulted from repeated freezing-thawing cycle. Serial 5-fold dilutions (9 dilutions in total) were made in hexaplicate wells of 96-well culture plates with a 50-fold initial dilution. The last column was designated as the negative control without pseudovirus. Trypsin-treated mammalian cells adjusted to a concentration mixed with DEAE-dextran were seeded to each well. After 48 h incubation in a 5%CO 2 environment at 37 \u00b0C, culture medium was aspirated gently to leave 100 \u03bc l in each well; subsequently,100 \u03bc l of Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following 2 min incubation at room temperature, 150\u03bc l of lysate was transferred to solid black 96-well plates for luminescence detection using Glomax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega, Fitchburg, WI).

After that, freshly trypsinized cells were added to each well. Following 48 hours of incubation in a 5%CO 2 environment at 37 \u00b0C, the luminescence was measured as described in the Section for pseudovirus titration. The IC 50 values were calculated with non-linear regression, i.e., log (inhibitor) vs. response (four parameter), using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated by comparing with the national anti-rabies standard (37.0 IU/ml).

All mice were housed and maintained in accordance with the relevant national guidelines and regulations. All procedures were carried out according to the protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC). All animals were obtained from Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources, NIFDC. The mice were inoculated with human rabies immunoglubins (HRIG) intramuscularly three days before virus challenge and bled just before virus challenge. The neutralizing titers of the mouse serum samples were determined using rabies PBNA. For the pseudovirus in vivo challenge assay, the mice were inoculated with different volumes for pseudoviruses, i.e., 0.1 ml for intramuscularly, 0.03 ml for intracerebrally, and 0.5 ml for subcutaneously and intravenously. For the wt virus challenge assay, the mice were inoculated with CVS-11 with a volume of 0.1 ml (40 LD 50 ) intramuscularly. For the pseudovirus challenge assay, bioluminescence was detected for each mouse. For the wt virus challenge, survival rates or signs of rabies were recorded for each group during a time period between 5 and 14 days after challenge.",

Pearson's correlation coefficient was employed to analyze the strength of the linearity between the log 10 -transformed values for PBNA and RFFIT. To compare the quantitative results obtained for the positive samples detected by both assays, a fitted regression model was compared by testing the two-tailed hypothesis of slope 1 and intercept 0. Bland-Altman method, i.e., a scatter plot of the differences between the paired measurements against the mean values of the samples, was used to assess the magnitude of disagreement between the two assays 31, 48 .
