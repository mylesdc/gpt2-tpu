The presently available treatment with interferon plus ribavirin, has limited benefits due to adverse side effects such as anemia, depression, fatigue, and \"flu-like\" symptoms. Herbal plants have been used for centuries against different diseases including viral diseases and have become a major source of new compounds to treat bacterial and viral diseases. Material: The present study was design to study the antiviral effect of Glycyrrhizin (GL) against HCV. For this purpose, HCV infected liver cells were treated with GL at non toxic doses and HCV titer was measured by Quantitative real time RT-PCR.",

An estimated 3% of the world's populations, (more than 350 million people) are chronically infected by HCV, which is the main cause of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1] . Like other RNA viruses, HCV possess a high degree of sequence variability that likely contributes to its ability to establish chronic infections after a mild acute phase. Current treatment of standard for HCV comprises a combination of high-dose pegylated interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) with the guanosine analogue ribavirin (Rib). About 75% of patients receive no therapeutic benefit from the current combination therapy with PEG-IFN \u03b1 and the guanosine analog ribavirin because of adverse side effects and high cost [2] . Vaccine development is hindered by the lack of good invitro and in-vivo models of infection, the antigenic heterogeneity of the virus and its ability to avoid immune defenses. Hence, there is a need to develop antiviral drug to treat Hepatitis infection from plant sources.",

HCV has six major genotypes and approximately 100 subtypes depending on the geographical distribution of the virus [3] . HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor of approximately 3000 amino acid residues replicated in the cytosol through a negative-strand intermediate. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) drives translation of the polyprotein, which is co-and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases to yield mature viral structural proteins Core, E1 and E2, and nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B, while an additional protein can be produced by a ribosomal frameshift in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein [4, 5] . HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) and nonstructural proteins (NS3 protease and NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase) are potent molecular targets of new antiviral compounds.",

Currently, there is no vaccine available for prevention of HCV infection due to high degree of strain variation. The current treatment of care, Pegylated interferon \u03b1 in combination with ribavirin is costly, has significant side effects and fails to cure about half of all infections [12, 13] . Hence, there is a need to develop anti-HCV agents, both from herbal and synthetic chemistry, which are less toxic, more efficacious and cost-effective. Previous studies demonstrated that medicinal plants used for centuries against different diseases including viral diseases and become a focal point to identify, isolate and purify of new compounds to treat diseases such as Hepatitis. Many traditional medicinal plants and herbs were reported to have strong antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses by inhibiting virus replication, interfering with virus-tocell binding and immunomodulation action [14, 15] . HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) and nonstructural proteins (NS3 protease and NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase) are potent molecular targets of new antiviral compounds. GL (licorice root extract) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. GL inhibits CD4+ T-cell and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytotoxicity [16] . GL has a membrane stabilizing effect [17] and also stimulates endogenous production of interferon [18] . 18-\u03b2 glycyrrhetinic acid, an active constituent of Glycyrrhizic acid shows antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses possibly due to activation of NFB and induction of IL-8 secretion [19] . GL has been used in Japan for more than 20 years orally and as the intravenous drug Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC). Oral GL is metabolized in the intestine to a compound called glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and intravenous GL is metabolized into glycyrrhetinic acid when excreted through the bile into the intestines. GL and glycyrrhetinic acid have both been tested against Hepatitis A, B, C-with some interesting results [20] [21] [22] . Previous studies report that GL has antiviral activity against HIV by inhibiting virus replication, interfering with virus-to-cell binding and cell-to-cell infection, and inducing IFN activity [23, 24] . GL has reported antiviral effect against Herpesviridae family viruses (VZV, HSV-1, EBS, CMV) and Flaviviruses by inhibiting the replication of virus [7, 25] . GL has also antiviral effect against some emerging viruses such as SARS by inhibiting the virus replication and production of NO synthase [26] The results of our study show that GL has antiviral effect against HCV at non toxic concentrations. Firstly, GL was checked for toxicological analysis in both Huh-7 and CHO cell lines. Our data shows that GL is non toxic at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcg ( Figure 1 ). The data was further verified by microscopic examination of cells and MTT cell proliferation assay [27] .",

Most of the studies all over the world are conducted in Huh-7 derived cell lines and with replicons supporting HCV RNA transcription and protein synthesis. Recently different groups have studied the HCV replication in serum infected liver cell lines for the study of different HCV genotypes which mimics the naturally occurring HCV virions biology and kinetics of HCV infection in humans [29, 30] . We infected Huh-7 cells with native viral particles from HCV 3a positive serum, the most prevalent type in Pakistan using the same protocol as established [29] . The results of our data demonstrate that GL has antiviral effect against HCV in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2) . The results prove that GL showed 50% reduction of HCV at a concentration of 13 \u03bcg. At a concentration of 40 \u03bcg, viral inhibition by the GL reached up to 85%.",

Core protein is also able to up-regulate cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression in hepatocytes derived cells, providing a potential mechanism for oxidative stress [33] . The expression of Cox-2 in HCC was found to correlate with the levels of several key molecules implicated in carcinogenesis such as inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), activate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) [34, 35] . Our data shows that GL inhibits HCV core gene expression or function in a dose-dependent manner similar to interferon alpha 2a. This may be due to stimulation of interferon pathway by phosphorylation of Stat1 on tyrosine and serine [36] . GL may show antiviral effect due to its ability to reduce membrane fluidity [37] and up regulation of Cox2 or related pathway.",
