HCMV is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with AIDS, and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients. Current treatments for HCMVassociated diseases are insufficient due to the emergence of drug-induced resistance and cytotoxicity, necessitating novel approaches to limit HCMV infection. The aim of this study was to develop therapeutic peptides targeting glycoprotein B (gB), a major glycoprotein of HCMV that is highly conserved across the Herpesviridae family, that specifically inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane preventing HCMV entry and infection.",

The ability of synthetic peptides analogous to WWIHS-positive sequences of HCMV gB to inhibit viral infectivity was evaluated. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI), preincubated with peptides at a range of concentrations (78 nm to 100 \u03bcM), and GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy and analyzed quantitatively by flow cytometry. Peptides that inhibited HCMV infection demonstrated different inhibitory concentration curves indicating that each peptide possesses distinct biophysical properties. Peptide 174-200 showed 80% inhibition of viral infection at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and 51% and 62% inhibition at concentrations of 5 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Peptide 233-263 inhibited infection by 97% and 92% at concentrations of 100 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively, and 60% at a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM. While peptides 264-291 and 297-315, individually failed to inhibit viral infection, when combined, they showed 67% inhibition of HCMV infection at a concentration of 0.125 \u03bcM each. Conclusions: Peptides designed to target putative fusogenic domains of gB provide a basis for the development of novel therapeutics that prevent HCMV infection.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that belongs to the Betaherpesviridae. The virulence of this pathogen is directly linked to the immune status of its host. Primary HCMV infection is generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, although it causes a mononucleosis-like syndrome in some. After primary HCMV infection, the virus establishes lifelong latency and periodically reactivates with notable pathological consequences. In contrast, HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients such as AIDS patients and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients causes serious disease [1] . Primary infection of women during or right before pregnancy with HCMV is the most common cause of congenital viral infection leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Congenital HCMV infection is also associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and pre-eclampsia. The risk of primary infection in a seronegative mother is 1 to 4%, which carries a 30 to 40% risk of congenital infection [2, 3] . The majority of congenitally infected babies are asymptomatic at birth; however, 10 to 17% subsequently develop hearing defects or neurodevelopmental sequelae [4] . Although the most serious clinical sequelae are seen in cases where a mother acquires a primary infection during pregnancy, downstream side effects are also seen in cases where latent HCMV is reactivated [5] and where a mother is reinfected with a different strain of the virus [6] .",

            "text": "HCMV has a double-stranded DNA genome of 235 kb encoding approximately 165 genes [7] . It has a very broad cellular tropism resulting in potential infection of nearly every organ system. The ability of HCMV to enter a wide range of cell types involves a complex interaction between several viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell surface receptors, although the entry of herpesviruses into host cells is still poorly understood. The HCMV virion envelope contains at least 20 virusencoded glycoproteins that are involved in cell attachment and penetration [8] . Of these, glycoprotein B (gB) is the most abundant glycoprotein [9] and is highly conserved among the Herpesviridae [10] . Glycoprotein B plays a critical role in the HCMV entry process. Initially, gB along with gM/gN, is involved in tethering of virions to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of host cells. The short interaction of HCMV with HSPG is followed by more stable interactions with one or more viral cellular receptors, namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [11] , platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [12] , and toll-like receptor TLR-2 [13] . Glycoprotein B also interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, a coreceptor that enhances HCMV entry [14] . Integrins are known to synergise with EGFR as well as with other receptors to activate signal transduction pathways [15] [16] [17] . To complete the entry process, both viral and cellular membranes fuse, allowing the release of virion-associated tegument and capsid proteins into the cytoplasm. This final step of viral entry into host cells requires gB and the gH/gL complex [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

In addition to similarities in the overall structure of the post-fusion forms of class III VFP, there are additional similarities in the distribution of WWIHSpositive sequences (Figure 1 , red). The similarities include at least one extended \"fusion loop\" in the fusion domain (domain II), and one or more WWIHS scorepositive sequences in domain III. With the exception of the ACNPV GP64, each of these proteins contains another WWIHS positive domain II sequence near the \"hinge\" region adjacent to the domain.

For example, Enfurvitide (Fuzeon) is a 36-amino acid peptide that overlaps with a WWIHS score-positive sequence in the transmembrane protein (TM) of HIV-1, and prevents viral fusion and entry of the virus. To identify regions of HCMV gB that have a high propensity to interact with the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and which potentially may serve as HCMV entry inhibitors, we employed Membrane Protein eXplorer version 3.0 (http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpex), a computer program based on the WWIHS. Nine sequences with significant positive WWIHS scores were identified ( Figure 2 ). As expected, several of these WWIHS sequences corresponded to the predicted fusion domain of HCMV gB, including the predicted fusion loops. One of the WWIHS score-positive sequences spanned amino acids 146 to 200 (peptide 146-200) that had a \u0394G score of 4.33 kcal/mol. This sequence was split into two smaller peptides: 146-173 and 174-200.

Sequences of a representative class II viral fusion protein (Dengue virus E) and of class III viral fusion proteins with high potential to interface with lipid membranes (red) were identified using Membrane Protein Explorer software (MpeX version 3.0). As discussed in the text, a class III domain nomenclature is used here that can apply to both class II and III viral fusions proteins. The alternative domain number schemes used by Roche et al. and Heldwein et al. are noted in parentheses. The Dengue virus (DENV E) stem domain sequence that was not included in the protein used to determine the crystal structure has been added. The DENV stem has a positive WWIHS scale score, and corresponds to a previously determined inhibitor of DENV and West Nile virus [35] . segment within the fusion domain of HCMB gB had a \u0394G score of 3.39, and was split, consequently, into smaller peptides: 233-263 and 264-291. An additional peptide, 297-315 corresponding to another fusion domain sequence, was also synthesized, along with an additional 4 peptides corresponding to other WWIHS-positive domains of HCMV gB.

When tested in combination certain combinations of peptides (peptides 264-291 and 297-315) displayed increased inhibition of infectivity at concentrations of 125 nM (Figure 8) .

WWIHS identifies segments of proteins that prefer a transbilayer helix conformation to an unfolded interfacial location. We used the Interface Scale of the Membrane Protein explorer (MpeX version 3.0) computer program to identify these particular segments of HCMV gB. The Interface scale measures a residue's free energy of transfer within an unfolded polypeptide chain from water to a phosphocholine bilayer. We identified nine segments of HCMV gB that display high propensity to interact with the lipid surface of cell membrane, and designed peptides, ranging from 19 to 31 amino acids in length, that are analogous to the identified regions of gB. the basis for potential antiviral therapies. The success of the inhibition of fusion greatly depends, not only on biophysical properties of synthesized peptides and their concentrations, but also on the size and shape of the binding pocket of HCMV gB. It is possible that the potency of the peptides, either alone or in combination, can be increased by modifying the sequence of the peptides or by conjugating the peptide(s) to other molecules.",

Seven out of 138 15-mer peptides inhibited infection by more than 50% at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM. Three peptides (gB131, gB122 and gB94) with 50% effective concentrations below 20 \u03bcM were studied further. Peptide gB131 (residues 681 to 695 in HSV-1 gB-1) was identified as a specific entry inhibitor (EC 50 , 12 \u03bcM). The gB122 peptide (residues 636 to 650 in gB-1) blocked viral entry (EC 50 ,~18 \u03bcM), protected cells from infection (EC 50 ,~72 \u03bcM), and inactivated virions in solution (EC 50 ,~138 \u03bcM). Of the seven inhibitory peptides identified in the Akkarawongsa et al. study, three of them, corresponding to residues 346 to 360 (gB64), 436 to 450 (gB82), and 636 to 650 (gB122), were in regions of HSV-1 gB-1 with positive WWIHS scores. The success of their study affirms our strategy of targeting the WWIHS score-positive sequences as inhibitors of HCMV. Two overlapping peptides spanning the residues 496 to 510 (gB94) and 501 to 515 (gB95)",

HSV-1 inhibitory peptide gB64 (residues 346 to 360) identified by Akkarawongsa et al. corresponds to this region, with HCMV inhibitory peptide 297-315 being the analogous peptide ( Figure 10 ). It is possible that some of the inhibitory peptides identified for HSV-1 could be optimized to work for HCMV and vice versa. The fusion domain of HCMV gB may be the initial site of interaction directly with the lipids of the cell bilayer [31] . The HCMV inhibitory peptides could competitively block these interactions, or trigger downstream fusion events, and conformational changes in gB, prematurely. Inhibitory peptides corresponding to other domains likely do not block lipid interactions. Inhibitory peptides may employ several mechanisms of action, and therefore those that are analogous to domain III could block receptor interactions.",

Any two peptides that work additively to block the fusion of the virion with the host cell membrane must have unique amino acid sequences, biophysical properties and be present at certain concentrations that will allow them to interact with each other, with gB and, possibly, with other glycoproteins that are instrumental in the fusion event. Peptides 174-200 and 233-263 tested together showed only 42% inhibition at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM each (Figure 7) , and did not work in an additive fashion.

HFF were seeded at a density of 3.5\u00d710 5 cells in each well of a 24-well plate 24 hours prior to infection. HFF were washed with 1\u00d7 DPBS and mock-or virus-infected for 90 minutes at RT with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) preincubated with different concentrations of inhibitory peptides at 37\u00b0C for 90 minutes. After infection, virus was removed and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and Gluta-MAX (2 mM) was added to each well and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy and then quantified using flow cytometry.Peptide 174-200, for instance, demonstrated 80% inhibition of viral infection at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and 51% and 62% inhibition at concentrations of 5 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 3). Peptide 233-263 inhibited viral infection by 97% and 92% at concentrations 100 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively, and by 60% at a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM(Figure 4). The scrambled peptide (control), of peptide 233-263, was unable to inhibit HCMV infection significantly (data not shown). While peptide 264-291, alone, showed inhibition of 70.5%, at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM(Figure 5), peptide 297-315 tested alone showed 40% inhibition at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM(Figure 6). None of the remaining peptides showed significant inhibition of HCMV infection at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown). In addition to testing individual peptides in viral infectivity assays, peptides were similarly tested in combination. Interestingly, when peptides 174-200 and 233-263 were tested together, no significant inhibitory effect was shown(Figure 7). On the contrary, peptides 264-291 and 297-315 tested together displayed 67% inhibition at a concentration of 0.125 \u03bcM each (Figure 8). Representative fluorescent and bright light images of HFF cells infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) preincubated with or without peptide 233-263 at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM were taken 48 hours postinfection (Figure 9).",
