The objectives were to evaluate the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia in hospitalized children with pneumonia from developing countries, to identify predictors of hypoxemia, and to characterize factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A multicenter, observational study was conducted in five hospitals, from India (Lucknow, Vadu), Madagascar (Antananarivo), Mali (Bamako), and Paraguay (San Lorenzo). Children aged 2-60 months with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled prospectively. Respiratory and whole blood specimens were collected, identifying viruses and bacteria by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia at admission (oxygen saturation < 90%) were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and factors associated with 14-day in-hospital mortality were assessed by bivariate Cox regression. Overall, 405 pneumonia cases (3,338 hospitalization days) were analyzed; 13 patients died within 14 days of hospitalization. Hypoxemia prevalence was 17.3%. Detection of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory samples was independently associated with increased risk of hypoxemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.0-5.8 and aOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.3, respectively). Lower chest indrawing and cyanosis were predictive of hypoxemia (positive likelihood ratios = 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). Predictors of death were Streptococcus pneumoniae detection by blood PCR (crude hazard ratio [cHR] = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.5-14.0), procalcitonin \u00b3 50 ng/mL (cHR = 22.4, 95% CI = 7.3-68.5) and hypoxemia (cHR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.6-14.4). These findings were consistent on bivariate analysis. hMPV and RSV in respiratory samples were linked with hypoxemia, and S. pneumoniae in blood was associated with increased risk of death among hospitalized children with pneumonia in developing countries.",

            "text": "A large simulation study estimated that systematic pulse oximetry may globally prevent almost 150,000 deaths from pneumonia annually. 4 However, the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemic pneumonia are poorly recognized. The identification of such etiological agents would serve to better target preventive (i.e., vaccination) and curative measures (i.e., antibiotics and antiviral drugs), reducing the global burden of hypoxemia and pneumonia. Because of its high incidence and related mortality, particular attention must be paid to hypoxemic pneumonia in developing coun-tries. Pulse oximetry is still rarely available in health-care settings of developing countries. 5 In the absence of oximeter, hypoxemia can be detected by several clinical signs or symptoms, including cyanosis and increased respiratory rate. However, none is sensitive and specific enough to reliably detect hypoxemia. [6] [7] [8] Most studies of hypoxemia in children with pneumonia were performed in one country and rarely investigated the relationship between hypoxemia and microbiological results, so it would be useful to reassess them in a more recent multicontinental investigation. 2 The risk factors of death among children with pneumonia in developing countries have already been identified, 9, 10 but rarely regarding the relationship between microbiological findings and mortality. Assessment of clinical, para-clinical, and microbiological predictors of death would be useful to prioritize public health campaigns. Identification of microbiological agents associated with death and/or hypoxemia would be useful to better focus therapeutic measures. Indeed, hypoxemic pneumonia can be treated with oxygen in conjunction with other measures, whereas non-hypoxemic pneumonia with poor vital prognosis might need other regimens, such as antibiotics/antivirals or intensive care.",

Viral pneumonia induced diffuse, bilateral, pulmonary damage, 18 compared with bacterial pneumonia, with more frequent, well-systematized alveolar localization. 19 This is probably the reason why we noted that the two viral etiological agents evoking pneumonia were associated with hypoxemia. RSV is the leading cause of viral pneumonia in children, 20 frequently in association with severe disease. 21 We observed that it might be also a major cause of hypoxemic pneumonia. On the other hand, RSV detection was not related to increased mortality, but it is estimated that 66,000-199,000 children could die of RSV-associated pneumonia worldwide every year. Our study's power was probably too limited to demonstrate such associations.",

Similar results have been reported recently in a study from Botswana, 22 where researchers noted that RSV pneumonia in children induced more complications and longer duration of hospitalization, but mortality was lower in comparison to other agents. hMPV is recognized as a frequent etiological agent of pneumonia, causing severe disease. 23 Here, we determined that detection of this virus was associated with hypoxemic pneumonia in children. These findings might be related to the fact that these two viruses in respiratory samples might be the etiological agents of pneumonia. Another hypothesis is that they might be associated with co-infections.

In addition, the clinical meaning of pneumococcus detection in nasal samples by molecular testing is difficult to interpret because of the high prevalence of S. pneumoniae respiratory carriage in asymptomatic children. 26 We did not observe associations between pneumococcus detection in nasal samples and disease severity, although pneumococcus-positive blood PCR was linked with greater mortality. Molecular S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR is thus helpful in identifying bacterial pneumonia cases with the poorest prognosis who might need intensive therapies. Interpretation of molecular methods, such as PCR, to identify the etiology of pneumonia in children is, however, challenging. Respiratory viruses can be identified in asymptomatic children, and secondary bacterial infections in the lungs can easily be missed by these methods. In addition, identification of S. pneumoniae in blood by highly sensitive PCR may detect children with nasopharyngeal colonization only, which could lead to potential misclassification bias, particularly when using results of nasopharyngeal specimens to determine the etiology of pneumonia in children. We must be cautious with results interpretation. Moreover, PCT was the major biomarker associated with in-hospital death in our cohort. Several studies previously found an association between PCT and the risk of death or bacterial disease. [27] [28] [29] [30] However, such linkage has rarely been seen in pneumoniainfected children living in developing countries.",

Its main limitations include paucity of information on exposures before hospital admission (i.e., breastfeeding, food intake, or vitamin supplementation). In addition, microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult because sensitive and specific tests are not routinely available in practice. Thus, based on respiratory samples, we were unable to differentiate colonization from infection, particularly by S. pneumoniae. 31 However, analysis of the relationship between results from different samples and severity was contributive: we did not find associations between nasal colonization by pneumococcus and disease severity, hypoxemia, or death. Finally, selection bias might have occurred because of patient recruitment in hospital with inclusion of more severe cases or patients with easier access to care. However, we did not discern significant heterogeneity regarding SO 2 of infants at admission and inhospital mortality, which suggests that the results might be generalizable to different settings. We must acknowledge that 41% of the study population was enrolled in two sites from India, which might limit external validity. This proportion is, however, in accordance with estimates of global pneumonia incidence and related mortality: India might have accounted for almost 30% of the total number of severe pneumonia cases in children and 40% of the number of deaths worldwide. 25 In conclusion, RSV and hMPV could be major causes of hypoxemia in children with severe pneumonia in developing countries, while S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR is predictive of high risk of in-hospital mortality. Viral etiology might be considered in hypoxemic patients, whereas in very severe pneumonia, which can lead to death, S. pneumoniae may be implicated as the primary cause, even in the absence of hypoxemia at admission. Tachypnea and lower chest indrawing could be useful indicators of possible hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry should be included for better diagnosis in developing countries. Given these findings, preventive measures, such as increased vaccination coverage of children in developing countries, oxygen therapy of hypoxemic patients, and intensive cardiovascular support, even in non-hypoxemic patients, would reduce the burden of death by pneumonia in children.",
