For two-phase studies, appropriate weighted survival estimates have been derived; however, no estimator of cumulative incidence accounting for competing events has been proposed. This is relevant in the presence of multiple types of events, where estimation of event type specific quantities are needed for evaluating outcome. Methods: We develop a non parametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function of events accounting for possible competing events.

Figure 1 compares the average of the estimated standard error ofF 1 (t) in each simulation with the empirical standard error at the 20 different times of observation in the four different scenarios with random censoring of 15 %. They were found to be very close in all scenarios, as expected. Figure 2 reports the distribution of bias in each one of the 1000 simulated samples under random (panel a), case-control (panel b), stratified (panel c) and nested casecontrol sampling (m = 1, panel d). Bias fluctuates around 0 in each scenario, but it has more variability in the random sampling compared to other scenarios, resulting also in a higher mean value of absolute bias over the B simulations (still always lower than 0.2 %). The lower performance of the estimator in the first scenario is due to the fact that random sampling is not a convenient design in the simulated setting. In fact, in phase I cohort we expect around 90 events of type 1 (incidence of 9 % and sample size of 1000), thus if we randomly sample 100 subjects from the phase I cohort, we expect to observe only 9 events (in phase II sample). With such a small number of events, unbiasedness is in fact not sufficient to ensure a reasonable behaviour and to get enough information on event incidence. To address this issue, the other study designs (scenarios 2, 3, and 4) are indeed thought to guarantee to sample more events of type 1. Thus we recommend adopting efficient designs accounting for the event of interest. Relative and standardized biases were always lower than 6 % (data not shown). The mean square error, not shown, slightly increases with time, in fact variability is increasing in time (as confirmed by the empirical standard error ofF 1 (t) and by Fig. 2) . The average length of the confidence interval was consistently increasing with time, ranging between 7 % and 12 % in the random sampling and between 2 % and 4 % in the case-control, stratified and nested case-control sampling (data not shown). This comparison underscores the advantages of a careful selection of the subsample. Figure 3 reports results on coverage for the random, case-control, stratified and nested case-control sampling. The coverage was very close to the nominal value of 95 %, ranging mostly within a minimum of 94 % and a maximum of 97 %, except for very early times in the random setting.",

GST-T1 is a common genetic polymorphism in Caucasians, with 13-26 % of individuals displaying a homozygous deletion of the gene (null genotype). Subjects carrying the null variants fail to express the GST-T1 enzyme, that is involved in drug metabolism. Clinical information were available for a cohort of 1999 consecutive patients (mainly European Caucasians, aged between 1 and 17 years, median age: 5 years) newly diagnosed with ALL in the Italian Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Pediatrica centers between September 2000 and July 2006. Biological samples stored at diagnosis were available, but genotype was ascertained only in a subgroup (phase II sample) for an efficient use of specimens [11, 13] . The interest was to evaluate incidence at different relapse sites by GST-T1, that can only be estimated using phase II data. In order to select the subgroup to be genotyped we adopted an optimal strategy that is carefully described in [11, 13] . Briefly, sampling was done after classifying patients into 6 strata according to the event of interest (relapse/no relapse) and to 3 groups, defined by prognostic features in the treatment protocol, that modulate the intensity of treatment, we will call them 1, panel d) . For the first three scenarios a sample size of 100 was used, while in the nested case-control sampling a mean of 180 subjects was considered. Data were subject to a random censoring of 15 % (plus administrative censoring). Dashed lines represent the main bisector corresponding to the equality between estimated and empirical reference treatment protocols (Table 1) . Strata were not defined based on the competing event death due to toxicity-58 events -for efficiency reasons given that the event of interest was relapse. Patients were sampled at random without replacement from the 6 strata, with the sampling from each stratum conducted independently (stratified sampling) and with higher probability in the more informative strata according to an optimal design [13] . The full cohort of 1999 patients represents the phase I sample, for which clinical information are available, while genotype is ascertained in the phase II sample only (n = 601).",

This estimate is hampered, however, by the fact that some patients die shortly after their last visit to clinic -a group of individuals who cannot be considered as \"stopping care\" nor censored for the event of stopping care. In addition, the number of patients who are starting care is large and a high fraction have unknown outcomes (i.e., are lost to follow-up), generating informative censoring. Given that lost patients could reasonably be not in care, but they could also have changed clinic or 1, panel d) . For the first three scenarios a sample size of 100 was used, while in the nested case control sampling a mean of 180 subjects was considered. Data were subject to a random censoring of 15 % (over administrative censoring). Dotted lines represent the reference for CI coverage (nominal 95 %) be dead, one approach to obtain outcomes estimates has been to identify a numerically small, but random, sample of those who are lost [15] , intensively seeking their outcomes, and using them to correct outcomes among the lost. To illustrate, a cohort of 13,321 HIV-infected adult patients, who initiated ART treatment, were followed from ART initiation to either death, disengagement or administrative database closure (see Fig. 5 ). Among them, 2451 patients were lost to follow-up [35] , defined as not being seen at the clinic for at least 90 days (after the last return visit). A tracker went into the community to determine the outcome of a random subsample of 428 among the 2451 lost patients and got information on 306 patients (110 patient were found to be in care in other clinics, 80 died while in care and 116 were found to be not treated/disengaged) [12] . The 10,870 patients no lost to follow-up and the 306 tracked patients can been considered as the second phase sample of the whole cohort, stratified on lost to follow-up.",

The crude incidence estimate of disengagement is reported in Fig. 6 , the curve starts to rise after 90 days from ART start, that is the earliest possible time of disengagement, by definition. At 1 year, disengagement resulted 6.8 % (CI 95 % 5.7-8.2 %). This was subject to a strong influence of the competing event death in care that resulted 7.7 % (CI 95 % 6.8-8.9 %) at 1 year. A na\u00efve (but less expensive) approach to deal with informative censoring would be to treat all lost patients as events or, contrarily, as censored observations. We plotted the two corresponding curves in Fig. 6 , obtaining estimates of crude incidence at 1 year since ART treatment of 18.5 % and 0.2 %, respectively. We can consider that the true incidence will lie between these two estimates (that are however quite far in this context), as in fact it does ",

The estimator shows good performance in simulations under different scenarios and the variance, derived by the influence function of the subdistribution hazard and the Horvitz-Thompson theory, was very close to the empirical variance, therefore we expect it to be very close to the one obtainable by replicate weights (e.g. bootstrap) [7] . Confidence intervals, derived on the log scale, provided good coverage in simulations, but alternative confidence intervals might also be considered such as the complementary log-log transformation [36] . The proposed estimator was used to estimate incidence of relapse by genotype in a cohort of childhood ALL patients, where the genotype was ascertained only on a subsample of the cohort chosen by an optimal sampling approach based on relapse as the event of interest. Interestingly, we can also analyze the incidence of the competing event (toxic death) or of the combined endpoint (relapse or toxic death), but the efficiency could be lower unless the subsampling is adapted to this new endpoint by including a further strata on toxic death in the sampling process. This is particularly important since toxic death is a rare event in this context. We should also remember to avoid random sampling when the event of interest is rare, as discussed in the Simulations section.",

A subsample of lost patients had been tracked to ascertain the outcome, but if this tracking was not possible, a more basic/na\u00efve approach to deal with this informative censoring could have been to identify the variables affecting missingness, post-stratify the sample in homogeneous strata and use the missing probabilities for each strata as sort of sampling weights to adjust the incidence estimate. This approach would make an important assumption of missing at random that might be not appropriate and cannot be tested [7, 15, 21, 37] .

The use of calibration weights is advantageous when there is availability of phase I variables that are strongly related to the additional variables ascertained in phase II.

The crude cumulative estimator developed by Kovalchik and Pfeiffer [45] for two-phase studies for finite population follows the first approach, and the Cox model for two-phase designs [14] could be used to extend it for infinite population. Under this model we can estimate the effect of a covariate on the cause-specific hazard to address its impact on the event by an aetiological point of view. However it is well known that this does not reflect the impact of the variable on the crude cumulative incidence. The latter effect, even if affected by the incidence of the other competing events, could still be of interest for a public health prospective. Future work will concern the development of a regression model to assess the effect of a covariate on the crude cumulative incidence. The Fine and Gray regression model [19] could be extended to complex sampling by weighting the estimating function of the parameter of interest and working out their influence function.",
