Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5-2.5. Conclusions: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.",

In other words, we can compare the infectivity of the epidemic with others, already familiar to us. Second, the reproduction number can be evaluated multiple times, e.g., before (and after) an infection control measure intervention. To this end, it is needed to distinguish the reproduction number after control intervention from the basic reproductive number R 0 , which is estimated before the intervention. Now we refer to the reproduction number after control intervention as the effective reproduction number, denoted by R eff . Then we can compare R eff with R 0 , and we can evaluate the efficacy of a control measure quantitatively based on R eff . By doing so, eventually we can determine how to apply control intervention to reduce R eff to less than one. If R eff < 1, it is concluded that the control intervention works effectively, and that the outbreak will eventually be controlled by reducing the reproduction number to less than the threshold level, 1.",

This implies that a patient becomes infectious immediately after infection. However, the incubation phase occurs during the course of the MERS outbreak. To address this weak point, in future work we could consider the 4-dimensional SEIR (i.e., susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model, which has been employed in [28] to study Ebola epidemic model. The additional state in the SEIR model can help us deal with the latent period. \u2022 In this paper, we considered the epidemic curve data in [4] only from the early stage of the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, where there was no intervention to control the spread. Accordingly, we evaluated R 0 based on the data. In future work, we will also consider the epidemic data in [4] from the later (or closing) stage of the MERS spread in South Korea in 2015, so we can estimate the effective production number (i.e., R eff ), which is the production number resulting from interventions, such as education, quarantine, and the tracing of contacts by infected patients. By doing so, we can evaluate the effectiveness of each control measure on the spread of the infectious disease [29] . Eventually, such evaluation could help us improve public health policy.",
