In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN1 was isolated, serially propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better elucidate the molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains, we sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200. The results showed that the variations increased with the viral passage. The nucleotides sequences of non-structural protein (NSP)2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes did not change during the Vero cell adaptation process. After comparison of the variation characteristic of classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of PEDV virus was associated with 9\u00b426 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading frames (ORF) 1a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations. The aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV. The pig study showed that the early termination in ORF3 was more important for virus cell adaptation than virus attenuation.",

However, in October 2010, the outbreak of PED was reported in China, causing huge economic losses [6] , and the etiologic agent was identified as the variant PEDV [7] . During the following two and half years, the diseases caused by the variant strains were mainly prevalent in China and led to the death of millions of piglets [8, 9] . After first being reported in the United States (US) in May 2013 [10] , the Chinese AH2012 strain and other variant strains were also reported in South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Germany, and some other regions, causing significant economic losses to the global pig industry [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Therefore, more studies are required to gain a better understanding of the variant PEDV strains during the Vero cell adaptation process and to unveil the possible factors determining PEDV attenuation.

The full-genome sequence of parental strain YN1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200 were sequenced, compared, and analyzed.

The parental PEDV strain, YN1, was isolated from the intestine of a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea in 2013. The virus was isolated using the previously described methods [15, 16] . Briefly, the fresh filtered samples were treated with 10 \u00b5g/mL trypsin at 37\u02ddC for 30 min prior to inoculation of Vero cells. DMEM supplemented with 8 \u00b5g/mL trypsin was used as maintenance medium. The inoculation protocols were followed according to guidelines [15, 16] . Viral propagation was confirmed by daily observation of the cytopathic effect (CPE), reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The infected cells were fixed with cold ethanol as previously described [17] and incubated with our in-house mouse anti-S monoclonal antibody. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the infected cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) in the dark.",

Significant fluorescence signals could be identified at 30 hpi ( Figure 1D ). The viral titers were about 4.2 log 10 , 6.8 log 10 , 7.2 log 10 , and 7.6 log 10 PFU/mL for YN1, YN15, YN60 and YN144 ( Figure 1E ), respectively. The one-step growth curves showed that the viral titers of YN1 and YN15 were 2.2 log 10 , 3.4 log 10 , 3.8 log 10 , 4.2 log 10 , 3.9 log 10 PFU/mL and 4.5 log 10 , 5.8 log 10 , 6.5 log 10 , 6.8 log 10 , 6 log 10 PFU/mL at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 hpi, respectively.

We concluded that YN15, YN60 and YN144 were cell culture adapted compared to the original YN1 strain because their total and peak virus titers were higher and growth curves shorter than the YN1 strain ( Figure 1E ,F). These results suggested that the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) changes of passages YN15 and later might contribute to the cell culture adaptation of these strains. ",

The intestines of four pigs infected with YN15 showed typically fluidic, distended, and yellow water-like content ( Figure 2A) ; however, pigs in the YN144 group were as normal as those in the control group ( Figure 2B,C) . According to the IHC score system [24] , the IHC score of tissue of YN15-infected pig ( Figure 3A ), YN144-infected pig ( Figure 3B ) and pig in control group ( Figure 3C ) was 9.25\u02d80.75, 3.25\u02d80.375 and 0, respectively. The IHC scores in the YN15 treated group were significantly different compared to the YN144 treated group (p < 0.01; Figure 4 ). The clinical symptoms, necropsies and IHC assay results of the pig infection experiment showed that the YN15 is a virulent PEDV strain and YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain.

The differences in virulence and genome sequences between the parental and their derived attenuated strains were extensively studied [15, 25, 26] . These studies helped us better understand the variation characteristic of the Vero cell-adaptation process of PEDV strains. In this study, the passages YN15 and later were cell-culture-adapted compared to the original YN1 strain, and the viral titers of YN1, YN15, YN60, and YN144 were continuously increasing. These results suggested that the nucleotide and aa changes of passages YN15 and later might contribute to the cell culture adaptation of these strains. The comparison of genomic sequences of passages of YN1 and later could shed some light on the molecular mechanic of PEDV adaptation. In the virulence evaluation experiment of YN15 and YN144, the YN15 strain which was cell-adapted and was terminated early in the ORF3 gene could cause watery diarrhea in pigs and could colonize in the intestines (Figures 2A and 3A) , while no clinical signs in YN144-infected pigs were observed, indicating that infection efficacy was enormously decreased (Figures 2B and 3B) . The clinical symptoms, necropsies and immunohistochemical assay results of the pig infection experiment showed that the YN15 is a virulent PEDV strain and YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain. The comparison of genomic sequences of passages of YN1 and later could lay the foundation for better understanding the molecular mechanic of PEDV attenuation. In the other clinical trials, the YN144 was safe for pregnant sows and newborn piglets, and could provide enough protection to sows and their piglets against a new PED. The genome sequence characteristic of variant PEDV in the USA during the in vitro Vero-cell adaptation process was reported [27] . The two isolates (ISU13-19338E and ISU13-22038) were serially propagated in cell culture for over 30 passages and characterized for the first 10 passages. Nucleotide and aa changes of two PEDV isolates, ISU13-19338E and ISU13-20338, after 9 passages in cell culture were different. When the nucleotide and aa changes of YN1 were compared after 14 passages in cell culture with two isolates, ISU13-19338E and ISU13-20338, and after 9 passages in cell culture, none of the nucleotide or aa changes were observed to be the same. However, nucleotide and aa changes of YN1, ISU13-19338E and ISU13-20338 during the first few passages in cell culture were first observed in OR1ab and S gene. The virulence/attenuation phenotype data of different passages of these two isolates (ISU13-19338E and ISU13-22038) were not presented in their study. So, further research is needed to study the virulence/attenuation phenotype characteristic of variant PEDV. In our study, the isolates were serially propagated in cell culture for over 200 passages and characterized for the 200 passages. The attenuation of YN144 was evaluated in the pig model. The genome sequences comparison between the variant parental strains with their Vero cell-adapted passages could therefore help us to better understand the re-emerging variant PEDV. Moreover, the genome sequences comparison between classical and variant virulent/attenuated strains unveiled some common variation characteristics between these two pairs of PEDV strains.",

So, understanding Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV might help us to develop a new vaccine against the re-emerging PED. During the cell adaptation process, some mutations are responsible for cell adaptation, some for attenuation, and some for both [28] . Normally, the mutations occurring in the early stage of passages are related to adaptation. In this study, the cell cultures of parental strain YN1 and different passages, i.e., YN15, YN30, YN60, YN90, YN144, and YN200 were collected for sequencing. The sequencing results would be more specific if we used the plaque purified isolates as the sequencing samples. In the early passage-YN15-only the nucleotide sequences change of NSP11, S, ORF3, and M were noted. S glycoprotein (surface antigen) is the major surface protein in PEDV, which is responsible for viral receptor binding [29] [30] [31] . M protein was an important viral assembly process-associated protein [32] . ORF3 was the only accessory gene of PEDV and the variation of ORF3 during the cell culture adaptation process resulted in the virulence decrease of the PEDV [33] , as happened in TGEV [34] . It is believed that the variation of ORF3 between parental virulent strains and attenuated strains could be markers for both attenuation and cell adaptation of the virus [26, 29, 35] . Thus, the aa changes in S protein and M protein and early termination in ORF3 could be related to cell adaptation of PEDV.",

            "text": "In the non-structural genes, such as NSP2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12, NSP13, no nucleotide or amino acid change were noted, suggesting that these proteins are unrelated to variant PEDV Vero-cells adaptation. The nucleotides of other non-structural genes, NSP1, NSP3, NSP9, NSP11, were increasing changing during the passage. The nucleotides changes of these genes might play an important role in the transcriptional regulation and virus adaption and virulence. The aa change rates in the structural proteins were higher than those of the non-structural proteins, and the ORF3 was the most mutable gene. Besides early termination at 145 aa in ORF3 protein, it also had 8 aa changes just before the terminated position. The aa changes before the early termination position of ORF3 seemed to be a reason for virus adaptation. The ORF3 was therefore believed to be the most important gene responsible for the Vero cell adaptation of PEDV through in vitro passage. The E, S and M protein were highly changeable proteins, but after the 90th passage, the E protein became stable, the S protein was increasingly changed and the M protein reached a plateau from passage 15-90. Then from passage 90, the M protein changed faster than the S protein, and they reached the same mutation rate level at passage 200 (1.08%). The N protein was a conserved protein, with only two aa changes, and the mutation rate was 0.45% (Table 2 ) (Figure 1) . Table 3 shows that the variation of attenuation in both classical and variant PEDV strains can be characterized by 9-26 aa changes in ORF1a/b and S proteins, 1-3 aa deletions in S protein, early termination and 8-12 aa changes in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, M and N proteins, and the nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations of genome (RNA) sequence might also be involved in attenuation. However, to explore which nucleotides mutations contributed to the attenuation of PEDV we could use the reverse genetic approach. The early termination of ORF3 could be the attenuation and cell adaptation marker of the PEDV [26, 29, 35] , whereas in our pig infection experiment, the ORF3 early termination strain, YN15, was still virulent to piglets. Thus, we deduced that the early termination in ORF3 was more important for virus cell culture adaptation than virus attenuation, and aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV.",

Based on a previous pig study [36] , fecal virus shedding could be detected but no microscopic lesions or IHC staining could be observed in early stage of infection. In this study, the virus was undetected in rectal swabs of YN144 group although IHC staining was observed in YN144 group. This is because viruses are colonized in intestinal epithelial cells. If the intestinal epithelial cells are not destroyed, the viruses cannot be released from intestinal epithelial cells into feces and they cannot be detected by RT-PCR. The YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain which cannot cause the damage of the intestinal epithelial cells, so YN144 could not be detected from fecal samples, although their presence can be shown in the IHC results.",

To better understand the attenuation characteristic of PEDV, we compared the full genome sequences of classical and variant parental virulent/attenuated strains. The results showed that in the variant strains of PEDV, the variations increased with the passage. The NSP2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12, NSP13 were not related to the Vero cell-adaptation process of variant PEDV strains. The PEDV attenuation was associated with 9-26 aa changes in ORF1a/b and S, early termination in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations. The aa deletion at about the 144 aa position of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV. The pathogenicity experiment in the pig model showed that early termination in ORF3 was more important for virus adaptation than virus attenuation. These findings could help us better understand the mechanism of cell culture adaptation, attenuation of variant PEDV, and thus provide clues for further vaccine development.",
