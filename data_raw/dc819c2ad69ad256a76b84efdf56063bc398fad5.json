In a previous study, we developed a pseudovirus PV neutralization test (pPNT) using PV pv with the capsids of wild-type strains 21 . Following our report, other groups have also found good correlations between pPNT and cPNT 22,23 . pPNT is largely characterized by three factors: (1) capsid protein type (e.g. capsid proteins of wild-type strains or vaccine strains), (2) titre or amount of PV pv , and (3) threshold values of PV pv infection to determine the neutralizing antibody titre. The capsid protein type is critical for type 1 PV, exemplified by significant antigenic differences between the type 1 Sabin strain and the parental Mahoney strain by the VP3-T60K mutation 24, 25 , and by an emergence of the type 1 wild-type strain with significantly low antigenicity 26 . Absolute titre or infectious units of PV pv could be determined using focus assay 12 . The luciferase signal of PV pv -infected cells might be useful to determine the relative titre 22 . In cPNT, neutralization titre is determined by an endpoint reading for the cytopathic effect on infected cells, so it is an all-or-none reading. In pPNT, neutralization titre is determined by reading the PV pv infection, which represents a percentage of luciferase signal in the infected cells, which is not an all-or-none reading. Therefore, threshold values are required for pPNT to define apparent \"neutralization\" of PV pv . Threshold values of PV pv infection have been inductively estimated to give the best fit to cPNT results (2.5% to 25% of PV pv infection) 21, 22 . Variation of reported threshold values might suggest robustness of pPNT. Seropositive rates determined at a wide range of threshold values were substantially unaffected (e.g., seropositive rates for type 2 were 92% to 95% determined in a range of threshold values of 2.5% to 10%) 21 . The rationale to determine the threshold values remains to be provided.",

We determined the threshold values by maximizing the fitness of the seropositive rates (population with neutralization titre of at least 8). However, we could not directly compare the results because cPNT was performed with Sabin strains. To analyse the direct correlation between cPNT and pPNT, we analysed the distribution of PV pv infection (%) in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre (Fig. 2) . The PV pv (Sabin) infection showed a sharp peak around 0%, with medians of 2.0%, 2.1%, and 4.6%, for type 1, 2, and 3 PV pv (Sabin), respectively. The percentages of the serum samples that showed less than 5% PV pv infection at the cPNT titre were 71%, 71%, and 54% for type 1, 2, and 3 PV pv (Sabin), respectively. The percentages of the serum samples that showed less than 10% PV pv infection at the cPNT titre were 88%, 84%, and 72% for type 1, 2, and 3 PV pv (Sabin), respectively. A broader peak width for type 3 than types 1 and 2 might reflect intrinsic weak antigenicity of type 3 PV in humans vaccinated with OPV (Fig. 3) . The profile of the curves of type 2 and 3 PV pv (WT) were like type 2 and 3 PV pv (Sabin) 21 . In contrast, the curve for PV1 pv (WT) was significantly different from PV1 pv (Sabin), and it showed a broad peak width (median of 15%). These results indicated substantial suppression of PV pv infection in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre and significant antigenic differences for type 1 PV pv .",

Next, threshold values for PV pv (Sabin) were analysed using the seropositive rate and the degree of correlation to compare to cPNT (Fig. 3A) . For type 1 and 2 PV pv (Sabin), the seropositive rates were almost equal at a range of examined threshold values (5% to 15% of threshold values) and within 10% of variation from cPNT. PV3 pv (Sabin) showed relatively low seropositive rate (61%) with a threshold value of 5% (Fig. 2) . The highest degree of correlation between cPNT and pPNT in terms of residual sum of square was observed for threshold values of 5%. This suggested that threshold values of 5% might be optimal for pPNT with type 1 and 2 PV pv (Sabin). For PV3 pv (Sabin), a threshold value of 10% seemed to give an optimal correlation. This suggests that the levels of PV pv infection, under which about 70% of the distribution was included around the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ peak, serves as the optimal threshold for pPNT (Fig. 2) . With threshold values of 5% for type 1 and 2 PV pv (Sabin) and 10% for PV3 pv (Sabin), pPNT with PV pv (Sabin) showed high correlation with cPNT (R2 of 0.92, 0.83, and 0.79, respectively). For type 2 and 3, the results of PV pv (Sabin) were like PV pv (WT) (R2 of 0.81 and 0.77, respectively). For type 1, the correlation degree was drastically improved with PV pv (Sabin) compared to PV pv (WT) (R2 of 0.92 vs. 0.59), and the correlation between cPNT and pPNT was consistently observed among different age groups with PV pv (Sabin) in contrast to PV pv (WT) (Fig. 3B) 21 . For type 2 and 3 PV pv (Sabin), the correlation was also observed among the age groups, as previously observed for PV pv (WT) 21 . One of the critical points in PV serosurveillance is in the estimation of seropositive rate. Accurate determination of overall and age-specific seropositive rates by pPNT supports the potential of pPNT as an alternative to cPNT along with the observed high correlation.",

We also analysed lot-to-lot differences of PV pv (Sabin) with the standard monkey anti-PV sera (Fig. 4B) . Two different lots of PV pv (Sabin) showed similar neutralization curves with the antisera. Next, we tested the reproducibility with a set of human sera (total 131 samples) in three independent experiments (Fig. 5 , Supplementary Data 1).
