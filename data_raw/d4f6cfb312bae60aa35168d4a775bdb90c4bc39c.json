            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are the most common causes of infection, and viruses account for the majority of these infections, leading to significant levels of morbidity and mortality. 1 Emergency rooms (ERs) serve as the frontline for patients at highest risk for respiratory infection diseases, especially because of the acute nature of these illnesses. 2 The prevalence of respiratory viral infection (RVI) in adults admitted to the ER is largely unexplored, as most relevant data concern infants and children. 3, 4 RVI can be severe in elderly patients, especially in those with underlying respiratory or cardiac disease. During winter months, RVI can account for many of the admissions to hospitals. 5, 6 The etiology of respiratory infections in adults remains undetermined in more than 50% of cases. 7, 8 In a study with 510 adults hospitalized with pulmonary diseases, an overall prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in the lower respiratory tract was of 42\u00c12%, with rhinoviruses and influenza A virus being the most common. 9 In adults with acute asthma admitted to the ER, a prevalence of 12\u00c12% of RVI was found. 10 In another study, with adults admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms, viruses accounted for 15% of hospital admissions for respiratory infections. 11 Seasonality of certain acute respiratory tract infection pathogens can be explained by meteorological variations. In a study, temperature was highly inversely correlated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, and adenovirus frequency; rhinovirus was also associated with relative humidity (RH). Climatic factors may influence the interaction among the host, pathogen, and environment, increasing the probability of exposure, susceptibility, and infection. 12 In addition, experimental data have shown that air pollutants affect lung immune responses and inflammatory reactions and that these effects may underlie the increased risk for respiratory infections. 13, 14 Because of the large impact respiratory virus infections have on morbidity and even mortality, it is important to understand whether and how meteorological factors and exposure to air pollutants could influence respiratory virus infections. The aims of this study were to determine the number of emergency room visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and to evaluate the association between ILI/SARI frequency, respiratory virus prevalence, and meteorological factors/air pollution, especially in adult population, in a humid subtropical climate.",

            "text": "Seasonal cycles of infectious diseases have been attributed to changes in atmospheric variables, the prevalence or virulence of the pathogen, or the behavior of the host. 18 Earlier investigations have demonstrated that lower temperatures and sunshine duration, conditions usually encountered in winter, were associated with admissions for RVI. 12, 19 Temperature was found to be highly inversely correlated with RSV, influenza A, and adenovirus frequency. 12 Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between temperature and SARI cases. One possible explanation is that it was demonstrated that for every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, the risk of premature death and acute morbidity especially among respiratory patients is up to six times higher than in the rest of the population. Second, evidence is emerging that increasing temperature is associated with increases in air pollution, especially ground-level ozone, and can amplify the adverse effects of poor air quality. 20 Taking this evidence into account, we could expect that higher temperatures may have increased concentration of pollutants, leading to more SARI cases. However, our data showed a decrease in air pollution during the months with a higher prevalence of SARI. The third hypothesis to explain the relationship between higher temperatures and SARI cases was related to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. ENSO undergoes cycles between warm phases (El Ni\u00f1o episodes) and reverse cold phases (La Ni\u00f1a episodes). In the southern region of Brazil, this phenomenon is associated with elevated temperatures and rainfall, especially in spring and in the period between May and July. Previous reports have determined that El Ni\u00f1o events were associated with increased hospitalizations and more severe influenza epidemics. 21, 22 Severe acute respiratory infection cases were found to be negatively related to RH in our study. Previous studies have demonstrated that higher RH decreases the survival of lipidenveloped virus, like influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and PIV. [23] [24] [25] The use of indoor heating in winter lowers the RH; breathing dry air could cause desiccation of the nasal mucosa, epithelial damage, and reduced mucociliary clearance, increasing the host susceptibility to RVIs. 19 However, even in tropical regions with humid climate (RH >70%), a higher activity of influenza can be found. This observation could be explained by the variation of viral stability in different RH levels. The stability of aerosolized influenza virions is maximal at lower RH (20-40%), moderate at higher RH (60-80%), and minimum at a mid-range RH (50%). 23 In a multivariate logistic regression model for IFI-positive patients, we found that AH was a protect factor for RVI. A recent study suggested that AH may better correlate with influenza virus survival and transmission. Unlike RH, AH measures the actual water vapor content of air irrespective of temperature and has a prominent wintertime low, both indoor and outdoor. Such findings suggest that humidification measures could be helpful decreasing survival and transmissibility of influenza. 26 Air pollution has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Studies have suggested acute effects causing respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular events, hospital admissions, and mortality. Although the available evidences indicate associations between exposure to pollutants and increased risk of RVI, potential mechanisms mediating these effects are largely unexplored. 27, 28 Surprisingly, our results showed that SARI cases were associated with a decrease in mean concentration of pollutants. In fact, this could be a reflection of higher rainfall in the same period, as rain acts washing out or scattering pollutants from atmosphere. 29 On the other hand, we cannot exclude an effect of indoor pollution. In the last years, indoor pollution has been recognized as an emerging health problem, as about 90% of our time is spent indoors where we are exposed to chemical and biological contaminants. 30 We estimated indoor pollution indirectly in our study, questioning patients about the use of wood stoves and air conditioning, and the presence of mold in home. Our findings suggested that IFI-positive patients were more prone to live in a residence with mold growth. Dampness and mold are two important sources of indoor pollution, consistently associated with respiratory symptoms. Home dampness may be a marker for mold growth, dust mites, endotoxins, and reduced ventilation, which could increase concentrations of indoor pollutants. 31 Cough, wheezing, and upper respiratory symptoms were associated with dampness and mold in a metaanalysis. 32 According to these results, the prevalence of cough and wheezing was higher in patients with mold in home and IFI positive.",

Air conditioning use was associated with fewer hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia on days with high concentrations of PM 10 , 33 as individuals are less exposed to outdoor pollutants. Nevertheless, the majority of virus transmission occurs within indoor, air-conditioned (i.e., cooler, lower humidity) environments that favor airborne virus survival and transmission. 24, 25 In hot and humid conditions, indoor transmission in air conditioning environments may account for most of the transmission. 34 We found a prevalence of 22% of RV, which is higher than that previous studies have demonstrated (between 12% and 15% in adults). 12, 13 Moreover, the length of stay was lower in our IFI-and/or PCR-positive patients. This finding is consistent with existing knowledge that virus identification allows the prompt initiation of therapy when indicated and avoids the unnecessary use of antibiotics, decreasing the length of hospital stay.",

First, it was based on data collected from a single center, which may have potential biases because of the characteristics of the catchment population, like vaccination coverage. Second, it is also important to note that this investigation was performed in a group of hospitalized patients, which is a bias toward the most severe disease cases. Additionally, we do not have the concentrations of individual air pollutants, but it is implausible to reliably separate the effects of air pollutants because they frequently react with each other, sometimes potentiating individual effects. 10, 35 The short study period should also be considered a limitation. Finally, the use of molecular techniques (PCR) in all study patients could be useful, increasing the number of viruses detected, as limited sensitivity of IFI method is well known. 10, 36 Despite these limitations, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to analyze the relationship between RV, meteorological parameters, and air pollution in an adult population.",
