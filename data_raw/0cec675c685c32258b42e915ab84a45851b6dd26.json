            "text": "Genetic decoding is not 'frozen' as was earlier thought, but dynamic. One facet of this is frameshifting that often results in synthesis of a C-terminal region encoded by a new frame. Ribosomal frameshifting is utilized for the synthesis of additional products, for regulatory purposes and for translational 'correction' of problem or 'savior' indels. Utilization for synthesis of additional products occurs prominently in the decoding of mobile chromosomal element and viral genomes. One class of regulatory frameshifting of stable chromosomal genes governs cellular polyamine levels from yeasts to humans. In many cases of productively utilized frameshifting, the proportion of ribosomes that frameshift at a shift-prone site is enhanced by specific nascent peptide or mRNA context features. Such mRNA signals, which can be 5 or 3 of the shift site or both, can act by pairing with ribosomal RNA or as stem loops or pseudoknots even with one component being 4 kb 3 from the shift site. Transcriptional realignment at slippage-prone sequences also generates productively utilized products encoded trans-frame with respect to the genomic sequence. This too can be enhanced by nucleic acid structure. Together with dynamic codon redefinition, frameshifting is one of the forms of recoding that enriches gene expression. Figure 3. Schematic representation of several viral frameshifting cassettes. (A) Retroviral frameshifting with the thickness of the pro and pol ORFs (pink) reflecting frameshift efficiency and the proportion of ribosomes that decode them with respect to zero frame gag (blue). (B) The \u22121 ribosomal frameshift site in two cardioviruses that yields a transframe encoded protein (pink). The proximity of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) shift site to the StopGo is evident and the relevant amino acid sequence is shown in Table 2 . (C) In arteriviruses, \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting near the end of a long 5 gene, ORF1a, leads a proportion of ribosomes to continue synthesis by decoding a second and also long gene (ORF1b), with the products of both ORFs specifying non-structural polyproteins. At least eight shorter 3 ORFs encode structural proteins. \u22122 ribosomal frameshifting in a central region of ORF1a causes some ribosomes to access the wholly overlapping +1 frame TF ORF to yield a C-terminal extension to nsp2 (the product liberated by proteolytic cleavage from that region of the polyprotein encoded by ORF1a). This frameshifting is stimulated in trans by virus-encoded nsp1\u2424 in complex with poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). (D) Listeria phage PSA. Capsid and tail shaft encoding genes utilize +1 ribosomal frameshifting on a proline codon just 5 of either a stimulatory pseudoknot (capsid) or stop codon (tail shaft).",

Doubtless applicability of the word 'steganography' to certain forms of genetic recoding and frameshifting in particular, was not envisaged when it was first used in 1499 to mean an intended secret message that does not attract attention in contrast to cryptography where just the contents of the hidden message is protected and not its existence. Nevertheless, its use in connection with productively utilized frameshifting by Patrick Moore (1) highlights the extra N-terminally coincident product(s) whose synthesis involves a switch from the frame set at initiation to one of the two alternative reading frames (registers) inherent with standard non-overlapping triplet decoding (Figure 1 ). The frameshift-derived product is generally quite different in both length and sequence from the product of standard decoding. It is not only ribosomal frameshifting that can yield a trans-frame encoded protein, but also where the RNA polymerase 'slips' to yield mRNA lacking or containing one or more extra bases (that are not 3 nt or multiples thereof). Such 'transcriptional frameshifting' also yields products that are trans-frame specified with respect to sequence present in the encoding DNA (or RNA in the case of some viruses).",

For space reasons, other features of the 'extra layer' in code readout, including dynamic codon redefinition and other processes that yield a trans-frame encoded product with respect to the DNA will generally be omitted (even though Figure 1 . Genetic 'Bletchley-ism': As illustrated with three letter words, the framing of genetic informational readout can be modified to convey meaning from genetic 'hieroglyphs' (cryptography) or additional and hidden meaning (steganography). Embellishing the old adage 'From tapes to shapes' (proteins), in several cases this involves 'shapes-in-the-tapes' unlike counterparts in many human languages. The process is dynamic, and the competition yields products from both standard reading and frameshifted reading. The relative proportions of the products from each are case dependent. Examples of genetic cryptography involving translational bypassing are in the decoding of phage T4 gene 60 and the mitochondrial genome of the yeast Magnusiomyces capitatus (56, 65, 158) and another type is in decoding the mitochondrial genome of glass sponges (252) . The latter is a WT translation component counterpart of the suppression of frameshift mutants by suppressor mutants of translational components. Examples of genetic steganography involving transcriptional realignment are in the gene expression of paramyxoviruses, potyviruses and the bacterial insertion sequence Roseiflexus IS630 (42, 99, 617) ; examples of genetic steganography involving ribosomal frameshifting are in the decoding of influenza A virus expression (125, 270) and D. melanogaster APC (46) . While standard expression of most bacterial release factor 2 genes, and also probably eukaryotic antizyme genes except for antizyme 3, yields a product that is non-functional on its own, the +1 frameshifting required for productive expression has been positively selected. The representation was inspired in part by a genetic framing garden 'rebus' (812) , a slide by V.N. Gladyshev and a recent publication (1). certain RNA processing (2) involves a ribosome/nascent chain complex, indel editing can have similar consequences to RNA polymerase slippage, and of course splicing is of major importance). However, tmRNA which has been recently reviewed (3, 4) will be treated minimally.",

In many cases the proportion of ribosomes that shift frame, or of polymerases that slip with consequent frameshifting with respect to their template, is constant (though in some cases this may reflect our ignorance of a relevant regulatory condition). This is often termed 'set ratio' frameshifting and the function is commonly generation of an extra N-terminally coincident product. In a second class, frameshift efficiency is responsive to the level of initiation or a trans-acting factor. In this class the frameshifting acts as a sensor and effector for regulatory purposes, either via synthesis of a functional trans-frame encoded product, mRNA half-life or new frame ribosome movement affecting translation of a downstream ORF, e.g. by affecting mRNA structure and initiation site accessibility. A third functional class is 'corrective' frameshifting where the effects of a 'problem' indel, at the DNA level (or potentially at the mRNA level, e.g. U-indel editing) are translationally compensated. Most known occurrences of this class are in mitochondria.",

For example, an indel that adds or deletes a G in a run of 7Gs in herpes virus thymidine kinase mRNA prevents susceptibility to a common antiviral drug. A very low level of frameshifting in decoding the run of Gs yields sufficient product to allow reactivation from latency but not enough to activate the drug inhibitory pathway (5,6) review (7) ('savior' being from the virus, and not the patient's, perspective). With 'compensatory' frameshifting, in general, the non-shift derived product is useless and degraded. Though use of the words corrective or compensatory would be questionable, from a mechanistic and practical perspective, the ability of a high proportion of ribosomes to simply ignore a synthetic unnatural base, and continue translation as if the base were not present (8) , is also pertinent.",

Other novel cases are claimed in yeast under oxidative stress (9) , in the context of broader translational adaptations (10) . An extreme in this regard is the retention over long evolutionary time of the ability of S. cerevisiae release factor, eRF3 to convert to its [PSI+] prion form and ribosomal frameshifting associated with it (11) (12) (13) that may have survival value under stressful conditions and create the opportunity for a later mutational change to genetically fix the newly advantageous trait (14) (15) (16) . Intriguingly, [PSI+] induces synthesis of a substantial amount of a trans-frame encoded variant from the gene for eIF1, and specific other translation initiation, tRNA maturation and amino acid metabolism genes (13) . In other cases, even when high level, frameshifting can be effectively inconsequential. In some, the signals promoting the high level were selected for a different purpose, and efficiency of degradation of 'dangling tail' C-terminal extensions is also relevant (17) (18) (19) .",

To an unknown extent, selection has presumably operated to generate features for avoidance of mRNA instability associated with the terminator in either of the utilized frames that is closest to the start codon. Avoidance is likely most relevant when the great majority of ribosomes are in the frame that leads to termination at the first terminator in either frame. Given the complexity of mRNA degradation and difference between the major classes of organisms, there is probably a diversity of answers with cytoplasmic transcription for many RNA viruses also being relevant. Parallels to the diversity of stabilities of internal UGA-containing selenoprotein mRNAs may emerge. However, attention is drawn to a sequence shortly after a frameshift site and 3 adjacent to a relevant stop codon, that binds a polypyrimidine tract binding protein that competes with UPF1 (20,21), a component of the nonsense mediated decay system. A more questionably relevant case involves the very different organization of an RNA virus genome whose decoding involves shifts into both alternative frames (22,23).",

Numerous high level frameshifting candidates for this have been identified (24-26). Many are not phylogenetically conserved, making it difficult to assess overall significance especially as the situation is different from where selection acts via the protein product. However, in some cases experimental analysis has yielded provocative insights as, for instance with the human CCR5 cytokine receptor that acts as a HIV-1 co-receptor with implications for other cytokine receptor mRNAs, especially interleukin receptor subunit mRNAs (27, 28) . This particular example is present from humans to lemurs. As a counterpoint to consequences of termination by frameshifted ribosomes, there can be dramatic effects of not having any stop codon in the new frame, as illustrated by a viral case (6) . On bacterial mRNAs lacking stop codons, tmRNA-mediated shifting of translation onto its own internal sequence is associated with both mRNA degradation (29) as well as abberant protein destabilization. (Utilization of frameshifting to lead to the unwinding of stem loops to permit downstream initiation is dealt with below.)",

In contrast many missense errors are inconsequential. The other extreme is the possibility of ribosomal frameshifting being frequent and \u223c100% efficient.

An example with polymerase realignment for low efficiency but high importance frameshifting occurs with potyviruses (42) (43) (44) . For both transcriptional and translational frameshifting, the efficiency of the nonstandard event is often greatly enhanced by stimulatory (recoding) signals, though current knowledge of such signals for transcriptional realignment is very limited.

Though it has not been experimentally investigated, there may be counterpart Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 15 7011 \u22121 frameshifting early in the decoding of phage cI mR-NAs where it is the short frameshift product that is rapidly degraded and the act of its synthesis serving as a 'ribosome sink' (57) , perhaps analogous to that, probably for a different regulatory purpose, in decoding some cardioviruses (58, 59) . In contrast, the function of frameshifting can be unrelated to products of the overlapping ORFs on which the frameshifting occurs. Though long postulated (60) , a bacterial case has recently been discovered where translation of a short zero frame leads to ribosomes frameshifting and their continued progression in the new frame affecting significant mRNA structure. In this instance, the consequence is allowing initiation of synthesis of an important downstream encoded protein (61) .",

Where the efficiency of transition to the alternative frame is close to 50%, a single nucleotide change can reverse the roles with longer product being derived from frameshifting almost at the end of the ORF yielding the shorter product. An example is bacterial dnaX, see below, which illustrates the relevance of efficiency to location.

In such cases, the potential for mutationally switching the downstream ORF to the zero frame cannot be simply accomplished, with retention of frameshifting for expression. However, it can occur with utilization of a different type of recoding. With a different retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, the downstream pol ORF is accessed by a few per cent of ribosomes reading through the gag terminator with near-cognate decoding of the stop codon. While some retroviruses utilize just a single such \u22121 ribosomal frameshift, certain others utilize two \u22121 frameshift events (62) and in these the first one is more efficient.

Increasing coding capacity from small genomes with expression occurring in relevant ratios and with appropriate timing, has doubtless contributed to viral utilization of frameshifting. Frameshifting-mediated polyprotein generation involving fusion to capsid components prior to later cleavage, can aid viral packaging of the viral polymerase (e.g. for retroviruses and totiviruses, but not positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses which don't package their polymerase). Some eukaryotic RNA viruses use polyprotein synthesis, in conjunction with IRES initiation, as part of their strategy to circumvent 5 -end dependence of canonical eukaryotic translation initiation, allowing its inactivation to shut-off host protein synthesis.",

However, despite breakthrough discoveries of frameshifting with many retroviruses and plant viruses, and even with intensive study over decades, it is only recently that frameshift utilization has been found in many important small to medium sized RNA viruses. This advance has depended on the development of relatively new comparative genomic algorithms to discern overlapping functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences (70) (71) (72) . RNA virus sequences diverge rapidly and, for medically or economically important species, there are frequently many sequenced isolates available, enabling (often even within a single virus species) the statistically significant detection of very short overlapping coding sequences and the RNA elements that direct their translation.

A total of 5% of ribosomes translating gag shift to the \u22121 pol reading frame to synthesize the GagPol precursor that upon cleavage is the source of reverse transcriptase, an endonuclease and a specific protease (Pro) (Figure 2 ). Those ribosomes that do not frameshift quickly terminate at the end of gag. The double-stranded RNA totivirus, L-A, present in killer strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae, and a variant L-A-lus in wine yeasts, use counterpart frameshifting (the effects of the killer toxin were originally noted by L. Pasteur). Its efficiency is substantially lower (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) . Red clover powdery mildew-associated totiviruses have a related frameshift cassette (82) . A \u22121 frameshift event is also involved in the synthesis of the HIV 1 and 2 GagPol precursor. With all these retroviruses, the viral encoded protease involved in polyprotein cleavage is encoded from the 5 part of the pol gene and so is in-frame with the reverse transcriptase encoding sequence. However, in both mouse mammary tumor virus and human T-cell lymphotropic retroviruses (83) (beta-and deltaretroviruses respectively), a second frameshift event occurs at the end of the protease encoding sequence, pro, permitting entry to the third and pol-encoding frame. This results in the synthesis of both GagPro and GagProPol precursors. The overall efficiency of GagProPol still has to be ca. 2% to 5% (for one at the low end of this range, the efficiencies of the respective frameshifting events are 23% and 8% (62,84) (Figure 3A) . The defective endogenous retroviruses, Intracisternal A-type particles (IAP) that accumulate in endoplasmic reticulae, also use two efficient separate frameshift events to synthesize their GagProPol (85, 86) . Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), which is highly expressed in some cancers such as colorectal carcinoma (87) , utilizes efficient frameshifting (88) . Having the reverse transcriptase being part of a Pol precursor with the Gag capsid components, facilitates its packaging into virions and in an inactive form (89) . [It has been proposed that HIV Gag-Pol frameshifting is linked to selective viral encapsidation (90) , but this has been challenged (91) .",

            "text": "Shortly after the discovery of splicing in 1977, it was widely suspected that it was involved in generating an mRNA from which GagPol was synthesized by standard decoding. However, suggestive evidence was quickly obtained that for the gammaretrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, whose pol is in the same frame as its gag, stop codon readthrough was involved and this was confirmed in 1985 (92, 93) . By 1984 two groups were testing whether frameshifting was involved in retroviruses where pol is in the \u22121 frame with respect to gag. A dilemma faced by both groups at the time was how to distinguish between a low level of ribosomal frameshifting and polymerase slippage (related to acknowledgements in (76) ). The initial 'proof' for retroviral gag-frameshifting being ribosomal rather than due to standard decoding of altered RNA arising from polymerase slippage, was the reported absence of fusionderived product in E. coli cell-free protein synthesis programmed with SP6 transcripts that yielded fusion product in reticulocyte lysates (76) . However, cassettes with the gag-pol shift region do exhibit frameshifting in such sys-tems with \u223c40% of the efficiency shown in mammalian systems (94) (95) (96) (97) (98) . Ironically for one of us, current in vitro work is revealing a modest level of HIV reverse transcriptase realignment (slippage) at the same 7 nt shift site at which the ribosomal frameshifting that yields GagPol occurs, to yield product with an extra base or lacking a base. This polymerase slippage is influenced by the ratio of two of the 4 dNTPs (C. Penno, P.V.B. and J.F.A. unpublished) (and possibly by an RNA structural feature different from that recently described (99) ). dNTP depletion is part of the hosts response to viral infection and lentiviruses, such as HIV-2, have developed a vpx gene to counteract this effect (100, 101) . The problem with the control in the initial published work on retroviral frameshifting (76) does not detract from its great importance and the elegance of both it and the subsequent work by the same group including the discovery of heptanucleotide \u22121 frameshift sites to which 2 tRNAs could pair in alternative frames (102) . A similar comment also pertains to the relatively recent finding that a proportion of the HIV frameshifting products are due to \u22122 rather than \u22121 frameshifting (98) .",

Allen Miller and colleagues from study of the frameshifting utilized by the luteovirus, barley yellow dwarf virus. This led to the attractive proposal that the frameshifting utilized by some RNA viruses to synthesize their polymerase is part of a 'traffic control' strategy. The newly synthesized RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proceeds from the 3 end to synthesize negative strands and soon disrupts the long distance pairing of the frameshifting recoding signals. Not only does this greatly reduce synthesis of now unneeded further polymerase, it frees the polymerase coding sequence for polymerase progression unhindered by oncoming ribosomes (110) .",

An example being members of the Astroviridae family which, like members of the Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae, have non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes (111, 112) . In humans, they are important causes of childhood gastroenteritis. Others use +1 or \u22122 frameshifting for the same purpose, e.g. Leishmania virus 1, and Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (family Totiviridae, with other members of the same family using \u22121 frameshifting or reinitiation to express polymerase). As the efficiency of this +1 frameshifting can be low, its experimental analysis is sometimes difficult. Curiously, different members of the family Closteroviridae, plant viruses with among the largest RNA genomes, appear to use shifting to the +1 frame at different distances from the terminator, to synthesize their RNA dependent RNA polymerase but further work is needed (113, 114) and contrast in (115) . In cardioviruses, the polymerase is encoded in-frame with upstream structural protein coding sequence, and frameshifting is utilized to divert excess ribosomes from decoding polymerase. This is illustrated by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) whose small positive-sense singlestranded RNA was widely used as a model mRNA in early eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis studies. Its \u22121 frameshifting mediates synthesis of a functionally important protein that has just 11 or 12 N-terminal amino acids encoded by the zero frame and 117 amino acids encoded from the new frame 'internal' ORF (58) ( Figure 3B ). For the related Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the trans-frame encoded protein is just 14 amino acids, 6 encoded by the zero frame and 8 by the new frame (58, 59) . Its frameshifting is a remarkable 74-82% efficient. It serves to divert most ribosomes to termination and allow only a greatly reduced number to continue for downstream encoded protein synthesis (a ribosome 'sink' function for frameshifting) (59) . Such a 'sink' function may be ances-tral in EMCV progenitors to the product of new frame translation acquiring a function. Interestingly, cardiovirus frameshifting involves a novel 3 stimulatory element (see below) and is dependent on viral infection, suggestive of a regulatory aspect.",

Frameshifting evolved independently on several occasions in flavivirus evolution, though the sites within particular clades are conserved (70, 119) . The Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses utilize frameshifting that has significant consequences for viral neuroinvasiveness (120) (121) (122) . Many insect specific flaviviruses also utilize frameshifting in their expression (119, 123, 124) , and some of these flaviviruses have major effects on medically important flaviviruses co-infecting the same mosquito cells. Not only does the frameshifting result in the synthesis of additional functional proteins, in some species it diverts a substantial proportion of ribosomes from synthesizing 3 encoded replicative proteins. This permits quicker recycling of ribosomes for synthesis of further 5 encoded structural proteins, and downregulates polymerase synthesis. However, utilization of frameshifting by certain other groups of flaviviruses including those containing Zika and yellow fever viruses is unknown.",

The directionality of the shift, +1, is different from that used by the viruses considered above, all of which are \u22121. While sites utilized for +1 frameshifting 5 adjacent to stop codons were previously known in chromosomal gene expression, +1 frameshift sites at internal positions are notoriously difficult to spot. The previously unrecognized type of site utilized by influenza A virus has provided guides for spotting the sites of other occurrences of +1 frameshifting including that for important chronic bee paralysis virus, related viruses such as Lake Sinai virus (125) and members of the Amalgaviridae family (126) . Influenza A virus is a single-stranded negative-sense, segmented RNA virus and the frameshifting occurs in decoding its segment 3. This segment yields a single mRNA that encodes a subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The frameshift-derived product, PA-X, has the same endonuclease domain as the polymerase subunit but lacks the C-terminal region needed for association with other subunits. Key amino acids encoded by the frameshiftderived segment that are important for the host shut-off function have already been identified (127) . In some viral strains the +1 frame encoded C-terminal extension is 41 amino acids and in others it is 61 (39). There is evidence for host species specificity with increasing prevelance of the shorter form in pigs for characterized reasons (128) . Potential significance derives from avian influenza viruses infecting pigs that serve as 'mixing vessels' for the generation of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Effects of PA-X on depletion of poly(A) RNA (129) , and in particular on specific host RNA polymerase II transcripts (130) , have been characterized. Though strain-specific (131), for some viral strains PA-X deficient viruses display higher virulence in mice than isogenic WT viruses (39, 131) , in contrast to the effects of disabling several other cases of viral frameshifting. No signals for stimulating frameshifting at the shift site are evident and correspondingly the level of frameshifting is very low. It is salutory that despite this very low level of the frameshifting, the frameshift derived product significantly modulates host expression. Its loss leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response including increases in inflammatory, apoptotic and T lymphocyte-signaling pathways (39).",

This frameshifting is in addition to the long known programmed \u22121 frameshifting that occurs several kilobases 3 of the new frameshift site ( Figure 3C ). The classical site, which was first identified in equine arteritis virus, is at the end of the long 5 coding sequence, ORF1a and frameshifting at it expresses a much longer replicase precursor polyprotein (134, 135) . The newly discovered frameshift site mediates both \u22121 and \u22122 frameshifting (22,23). The C-terminal region derived from the new frame after \u22122 frameshifting is relatively short but does have an alternative transmembrane region and is targeted to a different subcellular compartment. In the economically important pig virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, inactivation of the \u22122 frameshift product results in a 50 to 100-fold reduction in replication efficiency in cell culture (22), with the product down-regulating Swine Leukocyte Antigen class I (136) .

It is a levivirus. Though members of this genus are not as small as the mitochondrial-infecting mitoviruses and other members of the family Narnaviridae, their genomes are among the smallest for RNA viruses. The replicase of both the single-stranded phages MS2 and Q\u2424 is composed of three host translational components and one viral encoded component often termed synthetase. Synthetase is encoded by the gene closest to the 3 end of the positive-sense genomes that acts as mRNA. The termination codon of the gene for the 66 kDa Q\u2424 synthetase is substantially closer than its MS2 counterpart to the 3 end from which replicase commences synthesis of the negative strand. Though there is minimal space between MS2 genes, the termination codon for its 62 kDa MS2 synthetase product is 174 nt from the 3 end of its genome. Functional MS2 replicase likely assembles from components of the translation apparatus terminating synthesis of the synthetase and acts in cis on the nearby 3 end of the RNA -unlike its Q\u2424 counterpart it cannot be isolated in a functional state free from its RNA. Cell free protein synthesis studies revealed that \u22121 frameshifting yields a small proportion of MS2 synthetase of similar size as its Q\u2424 counterpart due to termination 63-61 nts from the 3 end of MS2 RNA (73, 75) . Product of this size has not been detected in vivo whether for lability or other reasons. It has not been determined whether the frameshifting has functional significance, but because of the short generation time and large progeny yield, the intense selection could have favored even very subtle effects.",

Neither product is present in the mature virions. The product of standard translation gpG, and the corresponding part of the longer and frameshift-derived gpGT product bind to the tail length measure protein, to form a complex with many molecules of gpG per single molecule of gpGT. The \u22121 frame encoded T domain binds to the major tail shaft subunit and may recruit it to polymerize around the tape measure protein which then determines its length (41) \u223c192 copies of the major tail subunit protein are in the final structure ( Figure 4) . This low-level 'G-T' frameshifting is widely conserved among other long tailed dsDNA phages, except T4, despite low sequence similarity of the respective ORFs of the different phages. However, in P2 and related phages the frameshift efficiency is 2-to 3-fold higher (141) . Counterpart \u22121 frameshifting also appears to be utilized by the siphoviruses Haloarcula vallismortis tailed virus 1 (HVTV-1) and three Haloarcula californiae viruses (HCTV-1, 2 and 5) that infect halophilic archaea, though that used by the myovirus Halorubrum sodomense tailed virus 2 (HSTV-2) is very likely +1 frameshifting (48, 49) .

Phage lambda and many other dsDNA phages gene g encodes gpG, a tail assembly chaperone, that binds to multiple regions of the tape measure protein gpH. Near the 3 end of the g coding sequence, a small proportion of translating ribosomes shift -1 and continue to synthesize the fusion protein gpGT. The 'G' portion of gpGT binds to the tape measure protein gpH, while the 'T' region binds the major tail protein gpV, linking them and mediating the initiation of gpV on gpH. However, gpG and gpGT both dissociate from the assembly, aiding the fast polymerization of gpV on the initiator complex to form the mature tail. Finally, the head binds to the fully mature tail to form phage lambda.

An occurrence of this type of frameshifting to yield an extension of the major coat protein of phage T3 results in two products from one gene in the viral capsid (150) . Cu-riously the counterpart extension in the close relative phage T7 (74, 151, 152) is not an Ig-like domain. With phage T3, and others such as Lactobacillus phage A2 (145, 146) , the Ig-like extension derives from \u22121 frameshifting. With Listeria phages A118 and A500 \u22121 frameshifting also occurs in decoding a coat protein gene, though in phage PSA it is +1 ( Figure 3D ). In all 3 phages additionally +1 frameshifting is utilized to derive a second product from the major tail protein gene (153, 154) . Apparent indifference to whether the frameshifting is +1 or \u22121, or even whether frameshifting is involved to yield the Ig-like extension instead of inframe decoding, has reasonably been suggested to reflect chance. Dynamic movement of Ig-like domains via nonhomologous recombination would land some in-frame and some out-of-frame with selection for function in the latter cases sometimes resulting in expression via frameshifting (155) .",

            "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus are human DNA tumor viruses that diverged over 80 million years ago. Each expresses from a single gene a minute amount of the multifunctional products, LANA 1 and EBNA 1, respectively, important for several purposes including maintenance of viral episomes, regulation of viral latency and impairment of cell-cycle checkpoints. The products have a central repeat region that plays a role in the evasion of host immuno surveillance. While classical studies have focused on the products present in the nucleus, recently product from KSHV has been detected in the cytoplasm (156) . The zero frame of the Epstein-Barr virus repeat region contains glycine and alanine, GA, codons and that of KSHV is rich in glutamine and glutamic acid, QE, codons. Although there is limited overall nucleotide sequence similarity between the two viruses, their repeat region sequence is highly similar though offset in terms of respective reading frames by 1 nt. A nested open reading frame in EBNA-1 mRNA encodes a protein capable of inhibiting antigen presentation in cis (157) . An efficient switch, or perhaps multiple switches, to the +1 frame with respect to the genomic sequence, during expression of the EBV sequence yields a product that has \u223c35% identity to the product of its KSHV zero frame counterpart (1) . The product of a synthetic EBV construct designed to express what would normally be the +1 frame, inhibits antigen presenetation in cis, consistent with functional relevance of the frameshift derived product which is substantially present in the cytoplasm. Switching to the +1 frame, which also could be by a \u22122 event, occurs in the expression of the KSHV repeat sequence and it generates a highly repetitive SR-rich peptide with a distinctive subnuclear localization pattern. Whether a switch to the \u22121 frame, to yield a GA-rich product, also occurs in the expression of KSHV is unknown, and relevant to whether there is any significance to what is the zero frame in the coding sequence. This situation has interesting relevance to the incidental but important frameshifting in the expression of repeat sequences involved in certain human neurodegenerative degenerative disease (see below). The special cases of mutant herpes viruses using frameshifting to counteract therapeutic drugs is also considered below.",

In bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 this is manifested in a \u223c300 nt stretch of its P-gene being translated in all three frames. The P protein of these viruses is essential for activity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. In Sendai and measles viruses, a slippage event at a specific site by polymerase transcribing the middle of the P gene results in 30% of the mRNA having a single 'extra' G (i.e. one more G in the product than the corresponding number of Cs in the template). This mRNA encodes the V protein that neutralizes host defences. For the mumps-like viruses (genus Rubulavirus) where the mRNA derived from standard transcription encodes the V rather than the P protein, 2 Gs are inserted at high frequency with the resultant mRNAs encoding the P protein. The pattern of G inserts for each virus reflects their respective ORF possibilities, and they have a mechanism to ensure that RNA with G inserts is not packaged into virions. In contrast, Ebola virus slippage occurs during transcription of its non-structural glycoprotein gene to yield transcripts without inserts and with one or two additional As in the ratio 70, 25 and 5% that encode soluble glycoprotein, transmembrane glycoprotein and small soluble glycoprotein, respectively (164) (165) (166) . A knockout of the slippage site in a recombinant Zaire ebolavirus significantly increased cytopathogenicity indicating a role for slippage products in reducing early cytotoxicity (165, 167) .",

            "text": "Potyviruses may cause more than 30% of all plant losses due to viruses and cause immense monetary loss and wasted fuel in intensive agriculture, a figure of $20 billion per annum has been cited (168) . Regardless of the monetary figures, they cause severe hardship and starvation for many on subsistence agriculture. In contrast, a potyvirus caused the highly prized pattern on tulips that triggered the first economic boom bust 'mania' in Europe (in the 1600s), and tests for potyviruses in orchids are lucrative ( Figure 5 ). Until recently the small single-stranded RNA genome was though to have a single ORF that encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved to yield functional proteins. However, there is a short overlapping ORF, pipo, that is decoded as the Cterminal end of a fusion protein P3N-PIPO (169) which mediates virus movement in plants (168, 170) and is relevant to overcoming host resistance (171) and jumps in plant host range (172) . Though it was initially suspected that PIPO coding sequence was accessed by ribosomal frameshifting, it is instead specific viral polymerase slippage, with insertion of a single additional base relative to the template, followed by standard translation, that yields the additional product (42) (43) (44) . Irrespective of the outcome of future work to determine whether the slippage events occur during synthesis of the minus-strand replicative intermediate or the plusstrand progeny genome, the mRNA with the single extra base behaves as a novel sort of sub-genomic (actually, supergenomic) RNA. The requirement for synthesis of a complete polyprotein to confer cis-replication competence (173) has been suggested to mean that the RNA from which PIPO is translated, is not amplified (42) . With turnip mosaic virus, the amount of deletional or +2 slippage, was very low so the amount of expression from the +1 frame was very small. However, with clover yellow vein virus, a product with its C-terminal 5AA encoded from the +1 frame, and derived from transcriptional slippage at the same site, has been detected, and shown, like P3N-PIPO, to function in cell-tocell movement (174) (Figure 5B ). Four related potyviruses infecting sweet potato utilize an additional slippage site at a different location to permit access to a second overlapping ORF and synthesis of a 'transframe' product that uniquely inhibits short-distance movement of an RNA silencing signal (175, 176) .",

As implied by the name for these viruses that infect bees, ants, flies, aphids, silk worms and some other arthropods, one of their characteristic features was thought to be the presence of just two ORFs separated by an intergenic IRES in their monopartite genomic RNA. However, at least the acute bee paralysis clade of dicistroviruses have an additional, and important, ORF, orfX, that overlaps in the +1 frame the ORF long known to be expressed from the intergenic IRES (180, 181) . This IRES, which has been useful as a reagent for 'all-RNA', i.e. factorless, and methionine-independent initiation, can mediate initiation in two alternative frames.

At present it appears that decoding of a substantial majority of all cellular and viral genomes likely productively utilizes frameshifting (inclusion of bacterial viruses is relevant). Viruses, especially RNA viruses, and other mobile elements, have comparatively small genomes, and the prelevance of frameshift utilization appears more striking than in much larger cellular genomes. As compact genomes, expecially those whose expression does not involve splicing, richly use translational versatility and controls, it is not surprising that frameshift utilization is no exception. Utilization of at least one frameshifting event in RNA virus decoding is almost more the rule than the exception. With the ongoing application of deep sequencing to viruses of terrestrial invertebrates, marine species of all types and to bacteria plus archaea in numerous isolated deep sub-surface niches, knowledge of instances of viral frameshifting seems certain to expand (with at least the bacterial and achaeal genomes providing prophage/integrated viral genome information).",

Sometimes they are present in only one or a few copies per bacterium, but up to more than a thousand in some cyanobacteria (182) . The over 4000 known different IS elements have been classified into several families (183) . While use of a frameshift event occurs in the decoding of the IS1 (184), IS3 (185, 186) , IS5 and IS630 families, it is very common in the IS3 family, which comprises 27% of the known IS elements (187) . Frameshifting serves to fuse the product of an upstream ORF, which generally encodes a DNA-binding protein that can on its own, act as a regulator, with a catalytic domain encoded by a partially overlapping downstream ORF that is often in the \u22121 frame ( Figure   Figure 6 . Bacterial Insertion Sequence (IS) with two partially overlapping ORFs. Many IS elements have this type of gene organization. Utilization of ribosomal frameshifting to allow a proportion of ribosomes translating orfA to access orfB has been studied in depth in a variety of IS elements, but transcriptional slippage is now known to be used as an alternative by a substantial number of IS elements. 6 ). The fusion has the transposase activity. Where tested, the level of frameshifting was found to determine the level of transposition (188, 189) . As a low level of transposase is optimal to minimize insertion-mediated host gene disruption, the frameshifting level is generally low. This mostly affects transposition frequency of the same IS element rather than copies of the same element located elsewhere on the chromosome, since transposase has a strong cis preference. This is related to the frameshifting itself since an associated pause signal influences cis preference presumably by facilitating sequential folding and cotranslational binding of the transposase (190, 191) .",

It has long been known that translocation of diverse chromosomal segments with different genes by flanking IS elements broadened IS significance. More recently it has been found that passenger genes, e.g. encoding transcription regulators or antibiotic resistance, can be within a 'transporter' IS element, and in other ways also relevant distinctions are becoming imprecise, e.g. among IS elements of Xanthomonas phytopathogens (199) . The distinction between certain IS and the much larger ICE type elements is also becoming more 'fuzzy' in part because of the type of transposase used by several of the latter (183) .",

            "text": "ICE (Bacterial Integrative and Conjugative Elements) are the most abundant conjugative DNA elements in bacteria. Naturally occurring non-symbiotic mesorhizobia that receive one of the well-studied elements, 502 kb ICE-MlSymR7A, via conjugation can communicate interactively with the pasture legume commonly known as bird'sfoot trefoil or deervetch (Lotus corniculatus), leading to the formation of bacteroids that fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (200) . Countervailing the potential population benefit of new endosymbiont formation is selection against disadvantageous occurrence to the original host of the element excision. Excision results in circularization and rolling circle replication. The element can be maintained in the multi-copy extrachromosomal state at energetic cost to the host, and in this state it has greater transfer propensity. For the vast majority of cells carrying the ICE element, this cost does not arise since in WT laboratory M. loti strain R7A, the excised state is only observed in 0.06% of log-phase and 6% of stationary phase cells with only \u223c3 in 10 million cells acting as transfer donor. A quorum sensing system keeps the process at a very low level but when derepressed excision can occur in 40-100% of cells and the transfer rate can increase 1000-fold. The ICE element encodes components responsible for a complex system of activators and repressors for quorum sensing and also components of the excision system responsive to it (201) . Crucial for excision is a product expressed from genes msi172 and msi171. Plus one ribosomal frameshifting near the 3 end of the msi172 coding sequence causes ribosomes to enter the msi171 ORF and synthesize Frameshifted excision activator, FseA, a master transcriptional activator of the excision system. Perhaps to modulate leaky expression, FseA itself is subject to binding and inhibition by a quorum-sensing antiactivator (202) . This antiactivator's own expression is bimodal so that individual cells are either 'on' of 'off' for propensity for ICE excision. This has been proposed to be part of a 'bet-hedging' strategy in which only a small proportion of cells in a population are sensitive to induction of excision, with potentially deleterious consequences for those cells but potentially beneficial cell population benefits. In this scenario frameshift utilization is part of the scheme for dampening biological noise present in a quorum-sensing auroinduction circuit and ensuring that excision is not spuriously induced. Ramsay, Ronson and colleagues who discovered the frameshifting involved, anticipate that nutrient availability likely contributes to the proportion of cells that enter the 'on' state, with frameshift efficiency being a sensor (201, 202) . Identification of the potential for frameshifting in similar genes in other elements suggests more widespread utilization (202) but the extent of this awaits investigation.",

In contrast to IS element usage of \u22121 frameshifting, S. cerevisiae Ty1, 2, 3 and 4 retroelements utilize +1 frameshifting near the 3 end of their gag-homologue gene to synthesize the GagPol polyprotein from which Pol and ultimately reverse transcriptase, is derived. Ty1 and Ty3 are present in up to 30 copies and 1-5 copies per cell, respectively, and their frameshifting is distinctive. Ty1 frameshifting was discovered at an early stage (206) (207) (208) . It utilizes a highly shift-prone site; 40% frameshifting was recorded with reporter constructs (209) . Yet its ratio of GagPol to Gag is only 3% (210) , much closer to that of other mobile elements. After the cap at the 5 end of the mRNA there is a pseudoknot that includes the start of the coding sequence but it serves to only modestly reduce the level of gag translation (211) . Though it does not yield accurate quantitation, the results from ribosome profiling for both Ty1 and another gene, ABP140, with the same shift site in their native chromosomal states clearly point toward the efficiency deduced from the reporter construct work ((212); A. Michel and PVB, unpublished). The discrepancy for Ty1 between 40% frameshifting and the much lower ratio of GagPol to Gag is currently ascribed to either a translational elongation effect in decoding the downstream pol gene, or reduced stability of GagPol compared to Gag (213) . The frameshifting utilized by another Ty element, Ty3 is mechanistically quite distinct (214, 215) . Its frameshifting is not a constitutive process but is regulated over a 10-fold response window depending on carbon source. The glucose-signaling pathway involved has been investigated in depth (216) .",

Ma3 expression involves ca. 20% efficient \u22121 frameshifting at a classical heptanucletide shift site stimulated by a classical H-type pseudoknot, and though not analyzed in detail, Ma5 appears similar (227) . The product of the sequence accessed by frameshifting is not similar to any known protein (neither Ma3 nor Ma5 encode any Pol domain). PNMA evolution in marsupials has yielded significantly different PNMA genes (228) .",

Many such neogenes are under epigenetic regulation, and maybe derivatives of their retrotransposon ancestor selected for cellular defense against that ancestor.

            "text": "Drosophila lacks telomerase; instead for at least 40 million years, three telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons have maintained chromosome ends. One of the three, HeT-A encodes only a Gag-like protein and not its own reverse transcriptase. Nevertheless, this important gag gene requires a frameshifting event for its expression (230, 231) . In another, TART(-B1), the gag termination codon is followed 3 by 37-nt before a +1 frame start codon which is presumed to initiate translation of the polyprotein that includes the reverse transcriptase (232) . As there is a stop codon in the +1 frame in the 37-nt 'spacer', if a GagPol product is synthesized via a tRNA realignment mechanism, it would likely involve bypassing rather than +1 frameshifting, but how the important polyprotein is expressed is unknown. Bypassing was considered as a possibility for synthesis of the counterpart product of mammalian LINE elements. Though only a tiny proportion of those in the human genome are active autonomously, collectively they are important in several ways. They have just three ORFs (233) , with a small number of nucleotides separating the 3 end of ORF1 from the start of ORF2 that encodes an endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity. However, rather than bypassing being involved in ORF2 expression, some unknown and novel type of initiation, independent of the AUG present, is considered more likely for the curiously stochastic expression involved (234, 235) . In contrast to Drosophila, as described in the section on special characteristics of ciliates and S. cerevisiae, the ciliated protozoan Euplotes has telomeres with frameshifting being required in the synthesis of the telomerase protein La and the reverse transcriptase (TERT) that is the homolog of S. cerevisiae Est2p. In another ciliate, Oxytricha, frameshifting would be required for expression of transposon-derived telomere-bearing elements, whose transposase has been 'domesticated/neofunctionalized' for the genome rearrangement involved in generating socatic macronucleus from germline micronucleus. These elements occupy 13.3% of the micronucleus DNA, and despite the presence of pseudogenes, purifying selection suggests many are expressed (236) .",

A three-protein preassembly complex is present in most of the cell cycle and late in the cycle, after completion of DNA replication, Est3 binds to form active telomerase, which is quickly disassembled by a different pathway. Est3-mediated limitation of the time of formation and quantity of telomerase to a low level may be important for avoidance of telomerase acting at doublestrand breaks where it could prevent repair that would restore genome integrity (238) . The +1 frameshifting occurs at a shift site similar to that of Ty1 just before a UGA terminator at codon 94. trans-frame encoded Est3 is 181 amino acids. The surface of Est3 that interacts with the telomerase RNP pre-assembly complex, the 'TEL' patch is similar to that of mammalian protein TPP1 (239, 240) , and is encoded downstream of the shift site (240) . Under the conditions tested, the frameshift efficiency is high in part due to an 8-fold stimulation by a 3 modular 27-nt stimulatory sequence (237, 241) . Even though a mutation putting the coding sequence into a single frame had no discernible effect on growth in lab media (237) , function is evident because of conservation, including of the 3 stimulator, in diverse budding yeast for 150 million years (242) .",

In frameshifted cell wall genes of an endosymbiont associated with aphids, and a histidine biosynthetic gene of an endosymbiont associated with ants, frequent transcription slippage/realignment at long poly(A) runs yields 12-50% of transcripts with 'corrected' reading frames (244) . The pathogenic kinetopast protists Trypanosoma and Leishmania have long been known to have mitochondrial uridine insertion/deletion type editing. But it also occurs in the mitochondria of endosymbiont kinetoplast Perkinsela where only six protein-coding genes have been identified despite the large size of the Perkinsela mitochondrial genome. Given the number of post-editing 'problem' mRNAs (245) , potential translational 'correction' seems also likely. Ribosomal frameshifting can also compensate for the effects of otherwise inactivating singlenucleotide insertions at various places in the encoding DNA, and examples occur in the mitochondria of several free-living species. Single nucleotide inserts occur in a small number (currently 6 known) of essential genes in the mitochondria of species from 4 animal phyla and 1 protist. Compensatory +1 ribosomal frameshifting apparently yields an adequate amount of functional product (246) . An insert occurs in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene of the majority of birds (247, 248) . The homologous gene in some turtles has the same insert and the insert likely originated in a common ancestor of birds and turtles more than 200 million years ago (246) . In some other turtles the insert is elsewhere (246, 248) . An insert also occurs in the cytochrome b genes of at least one oyster species (249) and at any of several sites in this gene in several ant species (250) . However, among the currently known instances, natural mitochondrial single-nucleotide frameshifting is most prevalent in glass sponges (251, 252) . These siliceous spicule-containing Hexactinellid sponges have exceptionally low metabolism, live in a low oxygen environment and their mitochondrial coding sequences show evidence of relaxed selection pressure (252) . The coding sequence of mitochondrial genes of several calcium carbonate spicule-containing Calcaronean sponges is largely unrecognizable and their transcripts have single or double U insertions in pre-existing short poly(U) tracts (nearly all their genes on individual and likely linear chromosomes) (253) . How the inserts occur and whether extensive compensatory ('corrective') frameshifting is involved in the synthesis of their protein products is unknown.",

They play crucial roles in ion channels and many biochemical processes including transcription and translation ( Figure 7 ). Not surprisingly, they have disease relevance (260) . The over 80 000 publications listed in Pubmed are a reflection of the level of interest they have attracted. Though elevated levels occur in cancer cells, their levels are normally tightly controlled. A key regulator of intracellular polyamine levels is the protein antizyme whose existence was initially postulated as an 'anti-enzyme' inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that catalyzes the synthesis of putrescine from which spermidine and ultimately spermine are derived (261) . Despite considerable skepticism about the reality of its existence, and practical difficulties, a mammalian antizyme gene was cloned. Two partially overlapping reading frames were identified, and the protein sequence encoded by the frame junction region was determined (262, 263) . Not only is +1 frameshift- Figure 7 . Schematic representation of synthesis of mammalian antizyme-1 (AZ) protein and the interactions between it, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), antizyme inhibitor (AZ Inhib), ATP citrate lyase (ACYL) and polyamine transporters. Increasing polyamines enhances the ribosomal frameshifting required for synthesis of antizyme, which then acts to inhibit synthesis and uptake of polyamines. Antizyme binding to an ODC monomer prevents the ODC dimer formation required for catalyzing synthesis of putrescine from which the polyamines spermidine and spermine are derived.",

Frameshifting does not occur in the decoding of the antizyme gene from the ciliate Tetrahymena (270) where UGA is reassigned from being a stop codon. An antizyme gene is not present in extant plants. Binding of mammalian antizyme 1, but not antizymes 2 or 3, to an ornithine decarboxylase monomer causes a conformational change that, without the involvement of ubiquitination, targets the ornithine decarboxylase monomer for degradation by the 26S proteasome via its own C-terminal segment (275, 276) , and at least in S. cerevisiae the counterpart targeting is promoted by polyamine binding to antizyme (277) . Polyamine binding to antizyme also influences ubiquitin-dependent degradation of antizyme itself (277) , and antizyme has similarities to a key polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase, that directly binds polyamines.",

Instead of accelerating ATP citrate lyase degradation, antizyme performs an activating role. Cellular spermidine and spermine induce spermidine/spermine-N 1 -acetyltransferase which acetylates polyamines for catabolism or secretion. A regulatory circuit involving its substrate acetyl-CoA in downregulating spermidine and spermine through acetylation has been proposed. An influence on acetyl-CoA has wider implications, including for histone acetylation, and initial studies on cholesterol have been performed (287) . Antizyme has also been reported to bind to Smad1, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A (288) (289) (290) , though there has been some controversy about this. A study of the binding sites of antizyme and cyclin D1 also revealed that binding affinity was 4-fold lower than for antizyme and ornithine decarboxylase (291) for which high resolution structural information is now available (276) .",

In contrast antizymes 1 and 2 are expressed in nearly all other cells where the requirement for polyamines may be lower. Functioning antizyme 3 is required for the rigid connection of sperm heads to tails and so for male fertility (300, 301) . A substantial proportion of the translation initiation on antizyme 3 mRNA is at an in-frame CUG codon further 5 with respect to the frameshift site than the AUG initiators for antizymes 1, 2 or 3, and so the product is Nterminally extended (301) . Frequent termination at the stop codon 3 adjacent to the frameshift sites can result in synthesis of the ORF1 product, p12, that has a distinct separate activity. p12 interacts with myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 3 (MYPT3), a regulator of protein phosphatase 1\u2424, and affects phosphatase activity (301) . Expression of full-length antizyme 3 is very low, and at least in heterologous tissue culture cells the frameshifting efficiency is also very low (266) . In marked contrast to antizymes 1 and 2, at what is expected to be standard expression levels, antizyme 3 has a stabilizing effect on it, probably by antagonizing antizyme inhibitor. Instead of targeting ornithine decarboxylase for degradation, antizyme 3 may serve to reversibly 'store' ornithine decarboxylase monomers (302) . This mechanism would allow a much faster restoration of ornithine decarboxylase activity than any mechanism mediated by antizymes 1 or 2, as they require de novo synthesis of the protein (302) .",

Because of the up-regulation of polyamine synthesis in important disease, much work is being devoted to identifying inhibitors.

For instance, macrophages use copper intoxication to kill bacteria (310) , and bacteria have an elaborate system to control copper homeostasis. Commonly, this involves a membrane-integral P-type ATPase, CopA, which pumps copper (and silver) ions from the cytosol at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. In several bacteria, but not in others, e.g. E. coli, a separate gene encodes a small soluble copper binding protein (metallochaperone) that transfers copper to its membrane-integral partner. In E. coli, a transporter-like function was proposed to be encoded by the 5 segment of copA (311), but how this occurs was not understood.",

A key part of the concentrating mechanism is giant organelle-like structures, carboxysomes, of 200+ MDa and 80-500 nm that contain thousands of protomers, and which have some resemblance to icosahedral viral capsids. RuBisCO is sequestered within the protein shell microcompartment. Remarkably just 10 genes from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus are sufficient to express the \u2423carboxysome in the heterologous bacterium E. coli (314) . One of these genes encodes the cargo proteins carbonic anhydrase and several encode shell proteins. Decoding of one of the genes, csoS2, required for carboxysome formation (315), utilizes 50% efficient \u22121 frameshifting (316). The product of standard decoding, Cso2B, is 869 amino acids and the product of frameshifting, Cso2A has 570 amino acids with its 3 C-terminal amino acids encoded by the \u22121 frame. Unlike Cso2B it cannot function in forming carboxysome. It has been speculated that the function of having two forms of Cso2 is related to partitioning of Ru-BisCO, Cso2B functioning primarily underneath the shell and Cso2A within the lumen of the carboxysome. But as Cso2B has only just been discovered, characterization will take some time. However, interestingly Cso2 has functional similarities to foot-and-mouth disease virus protein VP4 which binds to the interior side of the viral capsid (316). Currently 162 species are known with cso2 genes and 79 are predicted to utilize frameshifting (316), which is therefore important for the global carbon cycle. dnaX and the 1:1 ratio DNA polymerase products produced by alternative means",

In many fewer bacteria, the product derived from ribosomal frameshifting seems to be reversed with being derived from frameshifting and the termination codon for \u2425 being in the zero frame directly after the frameshift site (198) . One of these candidates that has potential stimulatory signals similar to E. coli dnaX, is Chlorobium phaeobacteroids (S. Heaphy, J.F.A. and P.V.B., unpublished). Though the expression of Thermus thermophilus dnaX is also not like its E. coli counterpart, its longer product, , is encoded in a single ORF as in E. coli. Transcriptional slippage results in a population of mRNAs with extra bases. As there are nearby stop codons in both non-zero frames (with respect to the template DNA), standard translation of those with non-multiples of three extra bases, yields \u2425 , which is again synthesized in a 1:1 ratio to (323). In E. coli, the shift site involved is highly shift-prone (94,320-322) due to the pairing of the sole tRNA Lys with the second shift-site codon involved being relatively weak (324). However, in Thermus thermophilus there are two lysine tRNAs one for each of the two lysine codons, AAA and AAG. As one of these is expected to tightly pair, and so poorly dissociate from AAG, this may be relevant to T. thermophilus utilization of RNA polymerase slippage rather than the ribosomal frameshifting used to generate its E. coli counterpart.",

Another ca. 25 proteins including transcription activators, are used to build the secretion system. In Shigella, which causes human dysentery, the encoding genes are plasmid-borne. After transcribing the first 58 codons of spa13, transcriptional slippage yields mRNA that results in 25 to 30% of the product having a C-terminal extension of 112 AA required for secretion system function. The encoding sequence for the end of this extension overlaps the start of spa32 and transcriptional slippage in spa13 has a major effect on spa32 expression (326). Spa32 is very important in the determination of the length of the hollow extracellular needle that forms the injection conduit (327). Spa32's role in length determination is affected by its interaction with Spa40 that also interacts with 5 other proteins including Spa33 and MxiA (328). Expression of spa33 and mxiA also involves transcription slippage but in these cases it yields truncated products (326). In addition, slippage to yield an extended product occurs in the expression of the regulator gene mxiE with substantial effects on the expression of the adjacent downstream gene (329). Whether the modulatory effect of the transcription slippage on the ratio of the products is influenced by environmental conditions is unknown. While this type III secretion system mechanism is different from phage lambda GT ribosomal frameshifting, expression of the Yersinia pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis YopN-TyeA fusion protein related to function of its type III system is also at the ribosomal frameshifting level (330,331). Y. pestis, the etiological agent of the infamous plague, is still a major human problem in several countries (332) and Y. pseudotuberculosis is a less aggressive foodborne enteropathogen. After it is transmitted by fleas to warm-blooded animals and the needle part of the type III secretion system senses contact with a host cell, a signaling system influences five proteins to no longer inhibit secretion of the effector proteins that reorganize the host cell. One of these is YopN. However, while the frameshift product has a distinct impact on fitness, the reason is not understood despite extensive work on the complicated system involved (331). Polyamines are linked to controlling the type III secretion systems (333,334) and the prospect that polyamines could influence the frameshifting event leading to YopN-TyeA hybrid synthesis is considered tantalizing (331).",

When the yeast S. cerevisiae buds several mRNAs are transported to the daughter cells in an actin dependent, but translationally independent, manner by the myosin machinery. However, the conserved Nterminal 17 amino acids of ABP140 is an actin binding domain (336,337) that co-translationally causes its mRNA to associate with actin cables and be transported to the distant pole of the mother cell, rather than to the daughter cell. Unlike much mRNA transport, this trafficking is independent of mRNA structure (338) . Zero frame codons 277-279 have a Ty1-like +1 frameshift site CUU AGG C (that involves neither Thr nor Ser tRNAs) and codon 280 is a stop codon. The doubtless substantial proportion of ribosomes diverted to the +1 frame decode a 348-codon ORF that specifies a methyltransferase, a major function of which is in formation of the 3-methylcytidine modification at position 32 of the anticodons of several tRNA Thr and tRNA Ser isoacceptors, hence the TRM140 (tRNA methyltransferase) designation (336, 339) . [Of unknown significance is that zeroframe codons 208-214 specify (DG)STSTTTS and codons 251-261 specify (DD)TTGDTTSSTTS (340) with the latter being just before a +1 frame stop codon at the end of a 171 codon ORF.] The resulting fusion of structural and enzymatic functions yields an indirect linkage of actin to tRNA modification. tRNA position 32 interacts with position 38 on the other side of the anticodon loop (341) with consequences for decoding accuracy (342) . The significance of the frameshifting and presumably of location-specific methyltransferase activity is unknown but likely related to its function in the yeast's natural environment and not in lab culture. [Why deletion strains are sensitive to neomycin is obscure (343) .] Nevertheless, given the time of divergence of the ancestors of the yeast species that have the characteristics of ABP140 frameshifting, the frameshifting has to have been occurring for 150 million years and be of selective advantage (242) .

Zero frame conservation only of the segment 5 of the frameshift site, and of the segment 3 of the frameshift product termination codon, implies that the part of the product of standard decoding encoded by the intervening zero-frame sequence merely serves as a linker. Significance of the frameshifting is indicated by conservation of the new frame product. Suggestive of an ancient origin of the frameshifting, it also occurs in nematodes, but interestingly, in that case the C-terminal region of the transframe product encoded by the \u22121 frame is much shorter (13 AA versus 125 AA) (46) . Immunoprecipitation of human APC reveals a variety of shorter than full-length products but whether any of these are frameshift derived is unknown -and not easy to analyze given the low expression level.

While some macrolides cause stalling during uORF translation with resulting prevention of sequestration of the ermC initiator, telithromycin instead, in a manner largely independent of nascent peptide sequence, induces a proportion of ribosomes to shift frame. Their continued translation in the new frame into the intergenic spacer unfolds mRNA structure and permits initiation of ermC expression (61) . Prior to this discovery, the most promising candidate for productive utilization of frameshifting to influence downstream expression via mRNA unfolding had been pheL, the uORF for the downstream bacterial phenylalanine biosynthesis gene, pheA, (especially Enterobacteria, e.g. E. coli). However, the frameshifting that does occur seems to be a by-product of the features responsible for the transcription attenuation control mechanism utilized and to be incidental (19) .",

Studies of specific individual Euplotes genes have revealed many where frameshifting is involved in expression, including protein kinases (34,35,358) and the telomerase components described above (31). In Euplotes, UGA is reassigned from being a stop codon, perhaps derived by selection as a defence against invading pathogens including in their food (359) . It has been proposed that the accompanying alteration of release factor recognition (360) results in poor decoding of UAA (in the ribosomal A-site) thereby enhancing the opportunity for frameshifting when the P-site tRNA has potential for re-pairing in the +1 frame (361, 362) . Though this is likely relevant, rampant frameshifting is not known in ciliates other than Euplotes even though they also feature stop codon reassignment (of UAG in some). Intriguing mysteries abound and the discovery that WT release factor can be involved in 4-base stop codon recognition may be relevant (363, 364) .",

Since a number of other chromosomal genes, including those for several transcription factors, have substantial runs of repeats (379, 380) , potential relevance elsewhere and perhaps not even incidental, is possible.

Identification of a modifier that has a big effect on the level of frameshifting (383) should be informative. In addition to the long known ribosomal frameshifting on runs of A to an alternative frame, realignment by \u22123 has recently been described to yield a zero-frame product with an extra lysine (384) . There is just a single AAA AAA AAA sequence in E. coli coding sequence (50-fold less common than extrapolated from the number of AAA codons) [Where ribosomal frameshifting to the +1 frame occurs by shifting either \u22122 or +1 nt, the frameshift product of the former has an extra amino acid compared to the latter. Retrograde realignment (toward the mRNA 5 end) has also been demonstrated with a cassette with a derivative of the T4 gene 60 bypassing sequence region; in that case, with coding resumption occurring in a different frame so that one ribosome decoded a sequence segment and, following transient peptidyl-tRNA anticodon: codon dissociation, realigned backwards to read the same sequence in a different frame to synthesize a single product (385) .]",

Further, hydroxymethylcytosine performs an essential role in Drosophila brain mRNA (388) and there have been numerous studies on N 6 -methyladenosine in mRNA (389) . However, it is unknown if any utilized frameshifting occurs at an mRNA modification site, or is dependent on ribosome heterogeneity. Frame transitions generally involve realignment. Sites at which ribosomal frameshifting occurs exhibit considerable variation in their inherent 'shiftiness'.

Though noted as occurring at the sequence (G UU)A AAG where substitution of a C with the italicized A created a \u22121 shift site at which the frameshifting compensated for a nearby \u22121 frameshift mutation (393), A AAG frameshifting was first extensively studied (394) , and later systematically explored, with synthetic constructs (195) . Such \u22121 frameshifting occurs incidentally in Bacillus at A CGA AAG to give an extended cytidine deaminase (18) and at G CGA AAG is productively utilized by IS1222 to synthesize its transposase (189) , and with drugresistant mutant herpes viruses (6) . Studies with it showed that the efficiency of this type of relatively low level \u22121 frameshifting is dependent on the identity of the two flanking 5 bases. Studies in E. coli of these nucleotides in the sequence NNA AAG focused on the degree of anticodon loop flexibility and base 34 modification of the tRNAs decoding the 5 codon (an underscore separates the zero frame codons). Codons whose cognate tRNAs exhibited greater wobble propensity gave higher frameshifting levels probably due to increased liberation of the third codon base, A, for the re-pairing of tRNA Lys in the \u22121 frame (193) .

This was discovered in retroviral frameshifting studies (102) . The motif has the form X XXY YYZ. While XXX often represents any three identical nucleotides, there are intermediates with the hexanucleotide situation just described; e.g. X XX is G GU in phage T7 gene 10 decoded by bacterial ribosomes (397), cardioviruses, e.g. encephalomyocarditis virus (58) and some luteoviruses; G GA in many insect specific flaviviruses (119, 123, 124) , some umbraviruses and dianthoviruses and in mesoniviruses (398); G UU(A) in equine arteritis virus (104, 134) ; C CA(A) in IS3 (399) and U CC in some members of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses (70, 124) . Initial studies in the contexts of retroviral frameshifting and coronaviral frameshifting showed that among the most shifty \u22121 heptanucleotide sequences with mammalian cytoplasmic ribosomes are A AAA AAC, G GGA AAC, U UUA AAC and G GGU UUU (62, 104) . Following on from the shiftiness described in the last paragraph for A AAG in E. coli, further work with synthetic constructs, also in E. coli showed that A AAA AAG is much more shiftprone than A AAA AAC, A AAA AAA, U UUU UUA or U UUU UUU (94) . Shortly afterward A AAA AAG was found to be the naturally utilized shift site for E. coli dnaX frameshifting (320-322). Approximately half of known bacteria including E. coli, have just one lysine tRNA for decoding both AAA and AAG. Its wobble position, base 34, S, which pairs with the third codon base, is U hypermodified with 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine. While the conserved base 3 adjacent to the anticodon, N6threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t 6 A), is critical for recognition of codons with first position A, it is the modification of U34 which is important for discrimination against asparagine codons, AAC and AAU, and also AUA, (400) and refs therein. NMR studies showed that these two modifications remodel an otherwise dynamic loop (401) . X-ray crystallographic studies with 70S ribosomes and long mRNA revealed a novel type of base-pairing interaction with third codon base G that broadens known wobble position geometries. In it the modified U is moved toward the minor groove in contrast to standard Crick-proposed wobble geometry in which the pyrimidine is displaced toward the major groove of the codon:anticodon minihelix (400) . This work highlights the role of the larger subunit, in E. coli ribosomes helix 69, for positioning and stabilization of the anticodon loop (helix 69 forms intersubunit bridge B2a relevant to regulation of groove monitor A1492 (402)). Further, the work is regarded as important evidence for their proposi-Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 15 7033 tion that steric complementarity is predominant over the number of hydrogen bonds for third base discrimination (400) . As the degree of stability of third codon position pairing is highly relevant to the codon:anticodon dissociation central to at least most frameshifting, several earlier discussions about frameshift sites and in particular the less restrictive third codon position, were likely overly focused on hydrogen bonding.",

            "text": "Depending on the realignment possibilities present, ribosomal frameshifting can be prone to occur when the Asite codon is slow-to-decode, due to limitation of the relevant aminoacyl-tRNA. Arising from his group's studies of amino acid starvation on single-nucleotide frameshifting (407) (408) (409) , Jon Gallant referred to such codons as 'hungry' codons. A slow-to-decode A-site is more generally important for +1 frameshifting than it is for \u22121 frameshifting. A very interesting occurrence involves the expression of Ty elements in S. cerevisiae and related yeasts. The Ty1 shift site, CUU AGG C on its own mediates a remarkable 40% +1 frameshifting. The S. cerevisiae shift site for ABP140 is identical and that for EST3 (CUU AGU U) is similar. The anticodon of the tRNA Leu that decodes CUU in the Ty1 shift site is 3 GAU 5 which has its wobble base 34, U, unmodified. This allows the tRNA in vivo to read all 4 CUN codons including CUU (410) . Where U:U apposition is involved, it is akin to the 2-out-of-3 reading identified elsewhere (411, 412) . Poor zero-frame codon pairing by peptidyl-tRNA Leu facilitates dissociation permitting re-pairing to mRNA at the overlapping +1 frame UUA. Slow recognition of A-site AGG by low abundance cognate tRNA Arg (anticodon 3 UCC 5 ) facilitates the frameshifting (209, 210) . The high abundance of tRNA Gly (anticodon 3 CCI 5 ) (413) cognate for the overlapping Ty1 +1 frame codon, GGC, is also important for efficient frameshifting. The implied competition for A-site decoding is mechanistically informative (414) .",

As discussed in relation to Ty3 frameshifting (415) , S. cerevisiae is unusual in lacking a tRNA Ala (anticodon CGC) that provides a good match with codon GCG which is instead decoded by tRNA Ala (anticodon 3 CGI 5 ). While inosine pairs strongly with U and C, its apposition with A allows weaker decoding (416, 417) and its purine:purine apposition with G is surely relevant to the frameshifting. Discussion of potential relevance of I pairing through its Watson-Crick side with the Hoogsteen face of A with the A base in the syn conformation with respect to the ribose, and counterpart I:G pairing (418) has been revived (387,419) and may be pertinent. (The IS1222 frameshifting mentioned at the start of this section also involves wobble position I:A apposition.) Unlike Ty1, with Ty3 the peptidy-tRNA does not have realistic standard pairing to the +1 frame codon as C:C, G:G, I:A would be involved. One interpretation is that slippage is not involved but there is some level of occlusion of the 3 base, A, facilitating incoming aminoacyl-tRNA pairing with GUU rather than AGU (214, 414) . Alternatively, there may be peptidyl-tRNA dissociation but not re-pairing to mRNA following slippage (420) . [The dif- (241, 421) .] Regardless, it is clear that Ty3 frameshifting yields Ala Val (422) . Surprisingly S. cerevisiae antizyme frameshifting (shift site GCG UGA C (273)) also shows +1 frameshifting even though there is -2 re-pairing potential (423) . In Kluyveromyces waltii yeast, which unlike S. cerevisiae does have tRNA Ala (anticodon CGC), the shift site is CCG UGA C. However, it lacks a corresponding tRNA Pro (anticodon 3 GGC 5 ) (423). Despite S. cerevisiae Ty3 and antizyme shift sites both having GCG, when both are tested in the same reporter system, and extrapolated from measurements in the absence of Ty or antizyme context effects, the intrinsic shiftiness of GCG UGA C (antizyme) is 37% and GCG AGU U (Ty3) is 2%, showing the greater effectiveness of the stop codon (214, 414) . [For comparison the shiftiness of CUU AGG C (Ty1 and ABP140) is 43%.] Correspondingly, as considered below, in its natural yeast context antizyme has inhibitory modulators while Ty3 has a stimulatory modulator.",

With disease level expansion of CAG repeats in huntingtin, frameshifting at multiple sites has been demonstrated, but in this case it is difficult to distinguish the relative effects of aminoacyl tRNA limitation from a stimulatory effect of a 3 structure formed from the repeat sequence (376) . This study importantly illustrates significance of relative expression levels of a relevant tRNA in different brain tissues. An independent study showed that mutation in a brain-specific tRNA causes neurodegeneration (428) . A subset of aminoacyl-tRNAs are tightly associated with translating ribosomes (429, 430) . To what, if any, extent this is relevant to CAG repeat, and other, frameshifting, is unknown. The issue is to what extent localized aminoacylation limitation for a ribosome translating, for instance a run of repeat codons, is a reflection of overall cellular limitation for that aminoacyl tRNA. In addition to extreme situations, such as when silk fibroin is being synthesized in silk glands, the pool of aminoacyl tRNA isoacceptors changes when different classes of mammalian mRNAs are being translated (431) . However, for the only virus tested where frameshift utilization is known, influenza A virus, it is the particular relevant local pool of isoacceptors that is selected rather than the tRNAs overall being adjusted (432) . Though some viruses encode their own tRNAs, whether any are relevant to frameshifting is unknown.",

            "text": "Natural perturbation of aminoacyl-tRNA levels occurs under conditions of amino acid starvation, a common situation in nature especially for a high proportion of bacteria, and is exacerbated in relA mutants when tRNA undermodification is more prevelant (433) . The effect of this on frameshifting has been studied extensively in E. coli (409) . What is unclear is under natural conditions, the extent to which such 'hungry codon' frameshifting leads to out-offrame termination with subsequent proteolysis contributing to recycling of scarce amino acids for the synthesis of proteins that are vital under such conditions. [While this type of frameshifting could contribute to the synthesis of transframe encoded proteins that have novel function specific for starvation conditions, no examples are known.] Almost all tRNAs have standard anticodon loop sizes. Among the few exceptions are a mitochondrial tRNA from yeast S. cerevisiae (434) , tRNAs in a phage (435) that has many relatives, (436) and a mitochondrial tRNA from the glass sponge Iphiteon panacea (252) . The S. cerevisiae tRNA has an extra base in its anticodon loop but neither it nor the other two, are known to mediate frameshifting. However, frameshifting does occur naturally in expression of several mitochondrial genes in Polyrhachis species and I. panacea. One of the I. panacea mitochondrial tRNAs whose anticodon loop very likely has 9 nts is tRNA Gly and it has 4 bases in the anticodon location that matches the UGGA codon at which the shift to the +1 frame occurs. The frameshifting properties of mutant tRNAs with 9 or 10 nt anticodon loops has been studied in E. coli with spontaneously arising mutants (437) or ones sought in code expansion studies (438); though enlarged anticodon loops do not necessarily imply other than triplet pairing inside WT ribosomes (439, 440) , the use of the anticodon loop of a tRNA switching stacking to present an alternative offset triplet anticodon has been proposed (441) . However, even if quadruplet pairing or an anticodon loop 'roll' occurred in a few cases of mitochondrial frameshifting, it would be exceptional and not the general explanation. Nevertheless, while much of the natural frameshifting in mitochondrial expression to circumvent potential deleterious consequences of mutational inserts follows the same principles as just described, some of the features are mitochondrial specific. At most of the insert sites in Polyrhachis ants, the zero-frame codon 3 adjacent to that for the peptidyl-tRNA Gly involved in the switch are AGY codons. Its cognate tRNA has a characteristic restricted to a subset of mitochondrial tRNAs in that it lacks the DHU stem, and has a distinctive structure. Perhaps it is slow-to-decode. The +1 frameshifting in decoding several genes in glass sponges occurs at extremely rare UGG (A), or CGG (A) codons (with all the inserts being T, or rarely C, 5 adjacent to a GGA codon). Though most of their frameshifting has been similarly interpreted to that of Ty3 (252), other possibilities merit consideration (mitochondrial ribosomes also have an E-site, despite an earlier proposal to the contrary, and so dissociation potential of the corresponding codon: anticodon interaction may be relevant).",

Utilization for searches of cellular gene utilized frameshifting is also possible (125) . Mutating the UCC codon to AGC (serine) or to GGG, CCC or AAA resulted in a 40 to 70% reduction in the frameshifting efficiency (39), giving credence to the possibility that UCC plays an important positive role in the E-site or at least 5 of the codon to which peptidyl-tRNA is paired at commencement of the shift (125) . Though it is somewhat of a 'special' case because of the nature of its stimulatory element (see below), prior work on E. coli release factor 2 frameshifting lead to the proposal that weaker 'E-site' pairing disturbance favored higher +1 frameshifting levels (443) (444) (445) (446) . However, though likely different for \u22121 frameshifting, E-site relevance was also demonstrated for HIV (405, 447, 448) , pea enation mosaic virus (406) and other cases of frameshifting. Additionally, in yeast, bioinformatic evidence suggests that when X XXY YYZ is in the P and A ribosomal sites, the identity of the two nucleotides immediately upstream in the E site are highly biased, suggesting an extended signal (449) . Fluorescence and FRET studies either involving single ribosomes or ensemble approaches with the stopped-flow technique showed that Esite dissociation is delayed on ribosomes stalled by the E. coli dnaX-, or a coronaviral, 3 \u22121 frameshift stimulatory el-ement (403, 450) . Nevertheless, single molecule studies with zero-mode waveguide tracking of ribosomes show that the E-site tRNA is released before the ribosome rotates backward, both with E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting and especially with T4 gene 60 bypassing (403, 451) .",

Non-cognate \u22121 frameshifting was shown in an early in vitro study that revealed frameshifting significance of the balance of tRNA. With an unperturbed balance of tRNAs, an ACC decoding tRNA Thr was shown to read a CCN proline codon to generate an elongated form of phage MS2 synthetase (73,75) (Figure 9 ). The identity of just 4 anticodon loop bases is important for this frameshifting (452) , but distinction between two alternative mechanisms remains unresolved (453) and whether there is relevance for other cases of frameshifting remains to be seen. [The only other tRNA found in that study to mediate non-cognate frameshifting was a tRNA Ser and it is these two tRNAs that decode AG codons (387, 454) .] The best known case of a different type of extreme recoding involving mRNA sliding, is in decoding phage T4 gene 60. Peptidyl-tRNA dissociates from codon 46, GGA and re-pairs to mRNA 47 nts 3 at GGA with coding resuming at the 3 adjacent UUA, codon 47. This and other cases involving stimulators are considered below. However, sliding on runs of A has recently been reported (384, 455) .",

The highly conserved shift site is CUU U, even though re-pairing to mRNA in the +1 frame involves first position G:U pairing. Other shift sites have doubtless been sampled repeatedly over the course of evolution, and UUU U does occur in a small minority of species. Significantly, in the release factor 2 genes that do not utilize frameshifting in their expression, the first position of the codon corresponding to the CUU is not conserved (443) . The most extensive substitution analysis of the CUU shift site, 32 variants, was performed with the 3 adjacent codon being UAG rather than UGA (390), though the values for the 6 substitutions that are the same as those used in an earlier smaller study with UGA (54), are consistent. CUU U was found to be by far the most efficient shift site raising the possibility that the simple, m1G, modification of the anticodon base 3 adjacent to that in the cognate tRNA Leu that pairs with the first codon base C, is important for the much higher levels than with UUU U where the counterpart base 37 of the cognate tRNA has the bulky adduct threonine in carbamoyl linkage to the 6-amino group of A37 (390) . While elaborate modification of base 37 of tRNA Phe helps restrain first position wobble in standard decoding, and first position wobble would not be relevant with a UUU U shift site, nevertheless its presence may be inhibitory for frameshifting. Several studies, including (354) , have shown that the identity of the base 3 adjacent to the ORF1 stop codon UGA is also very important, and a C at this position is highly conserved. ",

            "text": "With the exception of specialized cases such as Euplotes and S. cerevisiae Ty1/antizyme-like +1 frameshifting, all high level frameshing including much productively utilized frameshifting, involves stimulatory elements that enhance the proportion of ribosomes that shift frame at the shift site. Stimulators can act singly or in combination with other recoding signals whose effects are either inhibitory or stimulatory on their own with structural transitions and the degree of spacing of oncoming ribosomes being important in several cases. They can act synergistically as illustrated by IS911 where one of the stimulators also serves a role independent of frameshifting (194) . Stimulators can act in a variety of ways involving (i) certain interactions of the newly synthesized nascent protein chain with the ribosome peptide exit tunnel on its way to the exterior of the ribosome, (ii) pairing of the mRNA with rRNA close to the mRNA exit path, (iii) mRNA structure 5 of the recoding site stimulating bypassing and perhaps also being able to stimulate at least +1 frameshifting, (iv) likely mRNA pairing with rRNA close to the mRNA entrance channel, and (v) intra-mRNA structure 3 of the shift site. trans-acting factors include polyamines, protein release factor competing for the A-site, protein binding to a 3 mRNA sequence and miRNA. While codon usage (456) and pause sites further upstream could influence ribosome 'traffic' spacing and so potentally frameshifting efficiency, this has been established for initiation rate. HIV encoded Tat interaction with Tar in the 5 UTR can influence initiation frequency with substantial consequences for downstream frameshifting efficiency (457) , though the existence of a relevant IRES in the 5 UTR has been challenged (458) .",

However, shifting at the site involved, CCC UGA, only occurs at 1.9% in Salmonella enterica -possible reasons for the difference are discussed in the original publication (19) . In E. coli K12, not only is peptidyl-tRNA Pro relevant to the level of frameshifting, the identity of the penultimate amino acid, phenylalaine, is significant and that of the amino acid encoded 10 codons 5 is also relevant. So specific amino acid effects occur not just at the time of polymerization but well within the ribosome peptide exit tunnel. The frameshifting in this case appears an incidental accompaniment of features important for transcription attenuation. Still it is interesting that when tested in E. coli K12, the nascent peptide signal utilized to promote the efficient bypassing of 50 nucleotides in decoding phage T4 gene 60 (considered below) stimulated 60% +1 frameshifting at the CCC UGA (19) . Though CCC UGA is not known to be utilized for frameshifting in E. coli, it is not under-represented in K-12 with 19 genes terminating with it and in half of them the frameshifting occurs at more than 1% (464) .",

            "text": "Antizyme mRNAs with the CCC UGA shift site have naturally emerged in evolution but are in a tiny minority as only two were known at the time of an extensive survey (270, 293) . For the substantial majority of antizyme genes the +1 shift site is UCC UGA. When CCC UGA was tested in place of UCC UGA in a specific cassette in mammalian cells, significantly reduced frameshifting was monitored (465) . Of greater interest is nascent peptide relevance. As just discussed, the S. cerevisiae antizyme shift site GCG UGA C, is anomalously shift-prone. When accompanied by its flanking sequence the frameshifting level of 65% has been measured (268) . In contrast to organisms other than budding yeast, dynamic regulation is achieved by controlled reduction of the frameshifting level instead of controlled enhancement. As the discoveries on S. cerevisiae antizyme regulation by Dohmen and colleagues (268) are not only intriguing in their own right, their implications for the mechanism in other organisms make it desirable to consider first (Figure 10 ). At low polyamine levels inactivation of the frameshift inhibitory signals leads to a 20-fold increase in antizyme synthesis. A crucial inhibitory component is a nascent peptide encoded near the end of the coding sequence and only synthesized by a ribosome that frameshifted 669 nts (223 codons) upstream. At low polyamine levels, this nascent peptide interacts with the ribosome peptide exit tunnel to stall the ribosome. This blocks progression of following ribosomes and so of antizyme synthesis. However, at high levels polyamines bind Figure 10 . Scheme for S. cerevisiae antizyme mRNA +1 frameshifting. The top box represents low cellular polyamine concentrations, where ribosomes pause at the frameshifting site (RFS) with the ORF1 stop codon in the ribosomal A-site. Some terminate, while others continue translation in the +1 frame. An inhibitory element near the N-terminus of the nascent peptide, encoded near the start of ORF1, keeps frameshifting rates low. When a ribosome approaches the 3 end of ORF2, a newly synthesized part of the nascent peptide, causes this ribosome (pink) to stall. Following translating ribosomes (green) encounter the stalled ribosome and their movement is also blocked (line 2 with multiple pink ribosomes). When polyamine levels are high (lower panel) the nascent peptide encoded near the 3 end of ORF2, binds polyamines and is then unable to cause stalling. This allows the ribosome containing it to proceed to termination and release of functional antizyme.

For the leading ribosome to stall at low polyamine levels, there has to be adequate distance from the following ribosome and the frameshifting provides a partial 'choke' to decrease ribosome density and increase the spacing. [An additional more mysterious larger structural element specified upstream of this inhibitory signal but downstream of the frameshift site is also relevant.] A second inhibitory element is also a nascent peptide sequence, but it is encoded so far upstream of the frameshift site that it is expected to be well outside the ribosome at the time of its modulatory action. Changing the Ile encoded by codon 5 to Phe had a major effect and inactivation of the signal resulted in frameshifting efficiency increasing to 62%. Though it acts independently of the distal element, it has been proposed to facilitate the frameshifting pausing involved in adjusting downstream ribosome number for the distal sensor (268) . How it acts is unknown.",

            "text": "So far the only evidence for this comes from a study of antizyme +1 frameshifting in the Agaricomycotina class of Basidiomycota fungi. A nascent peptide encoded between codons 14 and 4 5 of the shift site, UUU, is highly conserved at the protein identity specific level (270, 466) . It is an important stimulator and serves a polyamine-sensing role for modulating antizyme frameshifting levels and so for the autoregulatory circuit (466) . It is perhaps even likely that part of the mRNA encoding this nascent peptide signal also functions as a recoding signal at the mRNA level in the mRNA exit channel and while it appears that the identity of the nts immediately 5 of the shift site are important at the mRNA level, effects at the amino acid level may in addition be relevant (466) . The Agaricomycetes are the only examples so far where bioinformatic analysis has pointed to a nascent peptide stimulator. However, we consider it likely that rather than Agaricomycetes being exceptional in that respect they may instead be exceptional in having reduced, or no, importance for the nucleotide sequence encoding a nascent peptide stimulator also having an important stimulatory role at the level of mRNA in the ribosomal mRNA channel. In this hypothesis, the counterpart nascent peptide sequence is also important in higher eukaryotes, but it is not apparent bioinformatically due to lack of third codon position variation because of the stimulatory action at the mRNA level also. Despite no pause being evident just 5 of the shift site at the end of ORF1 in ribosome profiling experiments, perhaps because of sensitivity reasons, the hypothesis raises the issue whether prolines and glycines are encoded in a relevant position upstream of the antizyme frameshift site. Some interchangeability between the imino acid proline which is very different from glycine could be informative in relation to the distinction between potential nascent peptide decoding effects and those due to either product function outside the ribosome or nucleotide sequence effects during decoding.",

            "text": "Excluding the special case of antizyme 3, there is frequent occurrence of either a glycine or proline, as in human antizyme 1, encoded 7 codons 5 of the shift site and flanked on one or other side by a proline or glycine ( Table  2 ). The location of the proline in human antizyme 1 in a complex of antizyme and some of its interacting partners is now known (276, 291) . Because antizyme has other interacting partners, caution is needed about function in intact protein except to note that proline would be very different from glycine. However, though context dependent (see below) tandem proline or proline glycine (see below) can be slow-to-decode. Proline is an exceptionally poor donor and acceptor for peptide bond formation for steric rather than electronic reasons (467) . Polyproline containing peptidyl-tRNA is prone to destabilization leading to drop-off (467) , and the ribosomes are trapped in a pre-translocational state with a free E-site (468) . In eukaryotes this is recognized by a protein with a tRNA-like shape, elongation factors eEF5 (formerly eIF5A), that aids polymerization, Reviews (469, 470) . Distinct from the type of association between polyamines and antizyme, in eEF5 a key lysine residue is uniquely post-translationally modified with polyaminederived hypusine. Hypusine, and different modifications on the bacterial counterpart of eEF5, EF-P, likely evolved for the stabilization of the CCA-end of P-site tRNA (470, 471) [Importance of CCA characteristics are shown by tRNA with CCA mutated to GCA or ACA causing frameshifting at a specific sequence and this being enhanced by mutants of hrpA (440, 472) that encodes an RNA helicase (473) . EF-P is also relevant to frame maintenance (474) .] eEF5's hypusine moiety interacts with the backbone of the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA and entropically steers the substrate into a more favorable position in the peptidyl-transfer center (467, 468, 475) . Reduced hypusination of eEF5 due to limiting polyamines, would likely lead to a greater stall presumably with increased drop-off (whether the third codon base in the key codons preferentially has non C or G in the third codon base to facilitate such hypothetical regulatory dropoff has not been addressed). Irrespective, perhaps reduced hypusination can influence the nascent peptide already in the peptide tunnel or some other feature of the ribosome that has an effect on frameshifting 6 codons later. Studies in bacteria have shown that the extent of stalling at proline codon stall sites is strongly influenced by the identity of the amino acids specified 5 up to a distance of 3 to 5 codons, though the effect decreases with distance. Though the pattern is complex depending on the identity of the stall site, codons for H, K, Q, R or W enhance stalling in contrast to those for C, G, L, S or T (476,477) (Note in the StopGo mechanism, below, the flanking amino acid on the N-terminal side is N, and UGG encoding W is strongly conserved as the second codon 5 of the antizyme shift site). Features of the nascent peptide just inside the peptide exit tunnel are likely relevant. The identity of the codon directly 3 and the extent of spacing between ribosomes can also be relevant (476, 478) . [A progressive effect over several codons of the gene 60 bypassing nascent peptide signal is described 2 paragaraphs down.] Sequence 5 of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site was shown to be important for the sensing of polyamine levels that influence frameshifting efficiency, though it was not distinguished whether the effect was direct or via its encoded product (465) . However, in these experiments the polyamine levels were varied more drastically than in the experiments in S. cerevisiae and Agaricomycotina (268, 466) . Further work will be required to assess whether the mammalian cell findings in (465) reflect a basic system that was Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 15 7039 Table 2 . Amino acids encoded by codons eight to five 5 of the frameshift site in diverse antizyme mRNAs. The antizyme 3 frameshift region is very different from all others in that it appears to lack all known stimulatory signals, and in heterologous mammalian cells gives a very low level of frameshifting. The identifiable signals in Zebra fish, D. rerio, retina and brain specific antizyme mRNA are intermediate in potential strength. For those mRNAs with a pseudoknot frameshifting stimulator 3 nts 3 of the shift site, the pseudoknot is expected to be at the unwinding site and at the outer edge of the mRNA entrance channel when codons \u22122 to \u22124 are at the ribosomal P-site.

The P is the N-terminal amino acid of the protein whose synthesis involves frameshifting. [One of the names for the phenomenon of nascent peptide mediated release, without a stop codon, of upstream encoded protein and continued translation (without initiation) to specify a downstream encoded protein (479) is StopGo (480) .] Whether the nascent peptide context required for StopGo serves to exclude eEF5 prior to facilitating hydrolysis of the ester linkage required for liberation of the upstream encoded protein is unknown. Under the conditions tested, which do not include altered polyamine levels, StopGo has not been shown to influence the frameshifting (58, 59) .

Nevertheless, in the absence of a nascent peptide modulator and independent of mRNA:rRNA interaction stimulation, increasing polyamine levels, such as occur at the early logarithmic phase of growth, enhance release factor 2 frameshifting (481) . While polyamines preferentially enhance the levels of quite a number of proteins whose synthesis does not involve frameshifting (481, 482) , this does not detract from significance of their stimulation of a subset of frameshifting, e.g. E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting is not stimulated by polyamines (481) . Ty1 +1 frameshifting can also be stimulated but it requires both elevated putrescine and greatly diminished spermidine (309) .

The nascent peptide recoding signal causes progressively slower translation of the last five codons before the site in gene 60 mRNA of codon:anticodon dissociation. The bypassing step takes 10 to 20 times longer than a standard cycle step, and after coding resumption in the new frame, step times take several cycles to return to normal. The initial progressive slowing is very important for ribosomes assuming the noncanonical rotated state that is central to bypassing (451) . Such progressive slowing is distinct from the prior prevailing thought that pausing sites in general would be single discreet sites. Unlike its secM counterpart the most important part of the gene 60 nascent peptide signal, KKYK, is 25 amino acids from the P-site when its effects on translational slowing starts to become apparent and 30 amino acids from the P-site at the time of codon:anticodon dissociation (451) . Consistent with the number of amino acids from a key part of the nascent peptide signal to the P-site being important, while retaining the 14 gene 60 codons closest 5 to the codon: anticodon site, replacing the further 5 codons with secM sequence natively just 5 of their pause site, still resulted in significant bypassing (451) ",

Later, together with its flanking sequence, it forms a functionally important stem loop, designated 'take-off stem loop' (160, 385) (Figure 11 ). Part of the sequence involved is 5 of the take-off site. The time, or times, at which formation of the take-off stem loop is important remains to be determined -it has recently been discussed in detail (451) . Sequence 5 of that which becomes involved in the 'take-off' stem can form an independent stem loop, designated 5' stem loop (485) . Evidence is accumulating that by the time the take-off codon has reached the ribosomal P-site, the 'top' 5 bp of that stem have already paired just outside the ribosomal mRNA exit channel. The current model is that after liberation of the mRNA on P-site codon: anticodon dissociation, completion of pairing with 4 additional base pairs in the 5 stem loop serves as a 'motor' by pulling mRNA 5 to start bypassing movement (451, 485) [Such mRNA structure formation mediated ribosome positioning has some parallels to the dicistrovirus InterGenic Region (IGR) IRES forming an extended structure that directs a proportion of the ribosomes on Israeli acute paralysis virus RNA to commence initiation in the +1 rather than the zero frame (181, 486, 487) .]",

Pairing of a minimal internal Shine Dalgarno sequence 6 nts 5 of the landing site with its rRNA complement in bypassing ribosomes has a modest effect on landing site selection (385) prior to coding resumption at the adjacent codon (a similar function for a Shine Dalgarno sequence has been proposed for the likely Streptomyces phage bypassing (161) though it is 5 of the start of the much shorter coding gap).",

            "text": "While the role of the Shine Dalgarno sequence in this case is relatively unimportant, internal Shine Dalgarno-like sequences are of major importance for bacterial single nucleotide frameshifting both \u22121 and +1. The number of nucleotides between frameshift stimulatory Shine Dalgarno sequences and the shift site at which it exerts its effect, depends on the directionality of the shift. For +1 frameshifting, it is 3 nts (54,490) and for \u22121 frameshifting it is 9-14 nts (491). It was known since 1975 (492) , that 30S ribosomal subunit recognition of Shine Dalgano sequences to position initiation was due to pairing of a sequnce near the 3 end of 16S rRNA. However, it was not suspected that this 'anti-Shine Dalgarno' sequence in translating 70S ribosomes scanned mRNA being decoding for potential complementarity. The finding of Shine Dalgarno-like stimulators for frameshifting showed that such scanning must occur (54, 493) . [It has also been recently shown for threadingmediated 70S-scanning initiation (494) , and is also likely important for translational coupling where the Shine Dalgarno sequence for initiation of a 3 adjacent gene is before the terminator of the 5 gene.] The \u22121 frameshifting assays led to the deduction that, after formation, the hybrid stays intact as the ribosome translates 5-7 nts and only then does it rupture (491) . Consistent with this, and the need for the anti-Shine Dalgano to be available to pair with its frameshift stimulatory complement and not be sequestered by pairing to a 5 counterpart, the sequence directly 5 of the stimulatory Shine Dalgarno lacks potential competitor Shine Dalgarno sequences (394) (Figure 12 ). Direct supportive evidence for hybrid maintenance for several translation cycles comes from the extended number of nucleotides protected from ribonuclease digestion, at internal Shine Dalgarno containing sites revealed by a ribosome profiling/footprinting study (495) .",

It is mimicable by a paired antisense oligo (505) . However, its functioning is still mysterious. An inhibitory stem loop has also been reported for pea enation mosaic virus frameshifting (406) . Earlier the effect of inserting a palindromic sequence that could form a stem loop structure was tested on feline immunodeficiency virus frameshifting (506) . To what extent inhibitors serve to link ribosome loading to Figure 12 . The features of release factor 2 autoregulatory frameshifting are highly conserved in diverse bacteria. The level of the release factor for the underlined ORF1 stop codon UGA(C) governs the efficiency with which the anticodon paired to the 5 adjacent codon, CUU, shifts +1 to pair with UUU permitting continued translation to synthesize release factor 2. The frameshift stimulatory internal Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is preceeded by sequence unable to pair with the anti-Shine Dalgarno sequence of translating ribosomes, permitting availability of the anti-Shine Dalgarno to form the correctly positioned frameshift stimulatory hybrid with mRNA. The figure was generated with Weblogo3 (815) using RF2 frameshift sites obtained from ARFA (348). frameshifting efficiency, and for virus infection potentially with phase of the infective cycle, remains to be seen.",

However, especially for nucleotides between the shift site and a recognized 3 stimulator, 'spacer' nt identity has to be treated carefully since it may be significant (405) . This has been explored systematically in E. coli (192) with attention being paid to stacking potential of spacer nucleotides. That study used an A AAA AAG shift site. Independent of utilization for frameshifting, AAA is used \u223c3 times more commonly than AAG except when the 3 adjacent base is C when AAG is preferred (507) . However, in the frameshifting study though 3 adjacent CC was the most shift-prone of the dincleotides, 3 C was in general more shift-prone than U (192) . Spacer nucleotide effects has also been studied with a variety of cassettes to a lesser extent in eukaryotes (104, 508) where in some cases an initially unrecognized 'lower' part of an identified structure, was thought to be 'spacer' nts, and, as just described, potential to interact directly with ribosomal components is a comparable issue.",

Associated with this has been an underappreciation of the variety of spacer lengths. As discussed in other sections these range from 3 nts for mammalian antizymes 1 and 2 +1 frameshifting to the 11-14 nts for arterivirus \u22122 and cardiovirus frameshifting.

            "text": "HIV also illustrates pairing of sequence just 5 of the shift site with sequence 3 of the shift site to form a structural base 'anchoring helix' that facilitates a functionally important transition between two alternate forms of the upper part of the structure mostly specified 3 of the shift site (509) . Other recent HIV experiments are also relevant (135, 510) . Despite this case nearly all 3 recoding stimulators known are specified wholly 3 of the shift site, even though in a few cases their extreme proximity to the shift site, just 3 nts for mammalian antizyme 1 +1 frameshifting, would require at least unwinding of the 'lower' part of the structure before the shift site is in the ribosomal P-/A-sites. Whether the important feature is a 'set up' for the remaining part of the structure or an alternative considered in the nascent peptide section above, is unknown. Irrespective of whether the antizyme pseudoknot stimulates the shift directly or indirectly, the extent of conservation of its constituent stems, but not its unpaired components, illustrates the value of what can be termed 'phylogenetic probing' for structure function inferences (270) (Figure 14) . The diversity of modulators 5 of the shift site is at least matched by that of 3 stimulators. As mentioned, the majority of intra-mRNA 3 stimulatory signals, have their 5 ends 6-9 nts 3 of the shift site and are thought to be at the mRNA unwinding site within the mRNA entrance tunnel (511, 512) when the shift site is in the P-/A-sites. Expression in heterologous systems (513, 514) and in homologous systems (98, 406, 515) , have revealed differences between bacteria and eukaryotic systems in optimal spacer lengths or within eukaryotes for specific 3 stimulators, in one case with implications for frameshift directionality. For a minority of 3 stimulators their 5 ends are 12-15 nts 3 of the shift site and are likely to have their influence at the outer edge of the mRNA entrance channel. These stimulators can involve either intra-mRNA structure or 'linear' mRNA with the characterized ones being associated with trans-acting factors (23,58,59). While the effectiveness of stimulators in general is selected to act at different efficiencies in different cases, the upper 'strength' limit for 3 intra-mRNA structural stimulations is that they must not act as a complete 'roadblock' to ribosome progression (516) . The type of 3 structures range from simple stem loops, as with E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting (392, 403, 517, 518) , likely plant sobemoviruses (463, (519) (520) (521) and explored systematically with the simian retrovirus shift site (522) , to more elaborate stem loop structures such as in bacterial IS911 (188) and HIV (509, 510) to compact pseudoknots as in poleroviruses, e.g. beet western yellows virus ( Figure 13B ), potato leaf roll virus and sugarcane yellow leaf virus (523, 524) , larger pseudoknots with all components specified nearby (see below), to pseu-doknots in which a lateral bulge-loop of an extended stemloop structure 3 -adjacent to the frameshift site interacts with an apical loop of a distant stem-loop structure (ALIL) (45, 110, 525) . A subset of related sequences can use either stem loop or pseudoknot stimulators, for instance among IS elements (187) , different alphaviruses (140) , and probably different flaviviruses (70, 120, 123, 124) . The great majority of the frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots studied are for \u22121 frameshifting, but some are known for +1 frameshifting. Multiple features of 3 intra-mRNA structural stimulators may influence frameshifting including thermodynamic stability, stem and loop lengths, torsional resistance, susceptibility or not to a protonated dependent switch and specific three-dimensional structures. The involvement of pseudoknots as frameshift stimulators was first shown for the coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (526) ( Figure 13C ) and predicted to be widespread (527,528) \u223c4 years after the discovery of retroviral frameshifting. The great majority are H (hairpin)type pseudoknots meaning that a sequence of nucleotides within a hairpin loop base-pairs with a complementary region external to the hairpin. All H-type pseudoknots contain two helical stems, S1 and S2, and two non-equivalent loops, L1 and L2. Some also contain a third loop, L3. The IBV frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot features a long stem 1 which cannot be functionally reduced to less than 11 base pairs, significantly equivalent to one turn of an RNA A-form helix (106) , and other pseudoknots such as those in the alphavirus, western equine encephalitis virus also have long stems (140) . In contrast, the MMTV gagpro frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot (529), features an unpaired intercalated 'wedge' adenosine between two short stems of similar length ( Figure 13D ). This frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot was the first to be characterized by NMR (530) . Thermodynamic and structural insights into the role divalent metal ions play in stabilizing the structure followed (531,532). The intercalated, or 'wedge' A gives a bent, 'kinked', structure that is important for function (533, 534) , though it contributes only modestly to stability (532) . A wedge A base is also present in several other frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots (85, 86, 227) including the related simian retrovirus-1 gag-pro pseudoknot (535, 536) where, despite the wedge A, NMR analysis highlighted the importance of stem coaxial stacking and loop L2-stem S1 interactions (537) . Other studies focused on the importance of the triple helical feature and several interactions (538, 539) .",

The efficiency of the infectious bronchitis virus pseudoknot with its long stem 1, is unrelated to the thermodynamic stability (106) or its mechanical unwinding properties (541) . The first cryoEM studies of ribosomal response to a frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot utilized the avian infectious bronchitis virus pseudoknot and revealed distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states (108, 542) . The more recent major improvements in cryoEM sensitivity means that invaluable insights will be forthcoming.",

Initially found for human coronavirus 229E (109) , it is also utilized by viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (543) . The pairing involves apical loops, and counterpart pairing involving an internal loop on one or other of the stems is described in the next paragraph. In contrast, the pseudoknot of the coronavirus that mediates SARS disease is an H-type pseudoknot, like that of infectious bronchitis virus. However, that of SARS virus differs in having part of its counterpart of loop 3 folded into a stem loop (543) (544) (545) (546) . This is involved in intermolecular kissing loop: loop pairing that functions in viral genomic RNA dimerization that in turn affects frameshift efficiency with likely regulatory consequences (547) . A pseudoknot stem 3 is also known to be significant for Rous sarcoma virus gag-pol frameshifting (548, 549) . An additional sub-structure between the main stem loops known as an 'Interstem Element' was characterized in the Visna-Maedi retrovirus frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot where it unusually comprises a 7-nt loop between the two stems and is essential for frameshifting promotion (550) . This pseudoknot features a long loop 1 (550) . By extrapolation an interstem element of 3 nts also occurs in the pseudoknot of the 1a/1b frameshift stimulator of the arterivirus lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (550, 551) .",

A similar arrangement, involving what is termed an ALIL pseudoknot, was also predicted for viruses in two Tombusviridae genera, Dianthovirus and Umbravirus (406, 463) . This was experimentally demonstrated for a member of each, red clover necrotic mosaic virus (554) and the RNA 2 (406) of pea enation mosaic virus (whose taxonomically unrelated RNA 1 is dealt with below). For RNA 2, the long-distance interaction modifies the lower stem of the stimulatory structure close 3 to the shift site, perhaps by strengthening its stability. However, the same study left open possible relevance of the interaction bringing close other sequence near the 3 end (406) . It is unknown if it is relevant that RNA 2, like the RNAs of many positivestrand RNA viruses, lacks a 5 cap structure and its capindependent translation features a sequence in the 3 UTR binding eIF4E and so recruiting eIF4F to mediate initiation via a long distance interaction (555) . (In barley yellow dwarf virus, the distal apical loop involved in long distance pairing to the frameshift stimulatory structure just 3 of the shift site is about 200 nts 3 of the element that permits cap-independent initiation.) Regardless, quite different considerations apply for the structure involved in bacterial IS3411 ribosomal frameshifting, and at least 27 other IS elements (45) . The counterpart involves pairing of the apical loop of a similarly positioned stem 1 with an internal loop of a stem loop 2 that is positioned in the range of 44 to 104 nts 3 depending on the IS element (45) . Remarkably the second component can, to some extent, act in trans (45) . With only two variant types currently known, others remain to be found. In addition, some unrelated long range effects remain to be explained including for phage T7 gene 10 frameshifting, where a CCCC sequence in the transcription terminator over 200 nts 3 of the shift site is involved (397) .",

Distinct from the techniques employed in its analysis, optical trapping has been used to reveal a dynamic ensemble of conformations of the mRNA encoding CCR5, a coreceptor for HIV-1, but their relevance to frameshifting requires further work (563) . However, it joins optical tweezers and others in the arsenal of techniques available. In contrast to several earlier proposals, optical tweezers experiments have strongly pointed to conformational dynamics (plasticity) being of prime relevance to frameshifting efficiency rather than the degree of pseudoknot resistance to mechanical unfolding (564) . Consistent with this, not all stable pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting and both structural (88, 565, 566) and mutational analysis of those that do, and do not, promote frameshifting has been insightful. There are many analyses of both categories but one of the mutational analyses is of the compact stimulatory pseudoknots of beet western yellows virus and potato leafroll virus where evidence has been obtained for certain bases being functionally significant but lacking substantial stability effects (567) . Studies with two pseudoknot stimulators show that frameshift efficiency is sensitive to the reading phase in which the translating ribosome encounters the pseudoknot but is not simply correlated with the extent of the associated translational pause (107) .",

One of the smFRET experiments used a strengthened variant of the dnaX stem loop structure with a G inserted opposite a bulged C, and the A of an A:G apposition changed to a C (518) , and the other used a stem with the same number of base pairs without any unpaired bases, though with a different sequence (403) . The single ribosome trajectory experiments studied by optical tweezers, and the associated mass spectrometric analayses of products were performed with mRNAs with potential to form a stem of either 25 or 55 base pairs (392) , instead of the 11 base pairs (including an A:U at the base of the stem) found to be functionally relevant in vivo (517) . The calculated strength of variant dnaX stem loop structures correlates directly with frameshift efficiency (517) and even without the 5 Shine Dalgarno stimulator just substituting one base in the otherwise WT stem to allow uninterrupted pairing, causes 160% of WT frameshifting (80% of ribosomes shift frame). While further strengthening the stem may facilitate molecular tweezer experiments, it may also approach the 'roadblocking' effect seen with extra strong pseudoknots, especially given the expected interchangeability of simple stem loops and pseudoknots. Accordingly, any extrapolations from the finding of \u22124 frameshifting in the studies of (392) to biological relevance needs to be treated with caution. The ensemble FRET experiments (450) used a shift site, U UUA AAG, that is different from that of IBV, U UUA AAC and of dnaX, A AAA AAG and the identity of the different P-site tRNAs influences the type of shift occurring (395) . [The whole pseudoknot or just its stem 1, can function in such heterologous expression systems (395, 581) though with differing effectiveness.] It is unknown to what extent these, or other differences in the systems used, account for the discrepancies reported. One set of the dnaX results is interpreted to imply uncoupling of EF-G catalyzed translocation from standard ribosomal reverse rotation, leaving the ribosomes in a non-canonical rotated state during which the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA has potential to pair in the 0 or \u22121 frame (403) (see also (108) ). In contrast, the other papers advocate slippage during tRNA-mRNA translocation at the second codon of the shift site (392, 450, 518) . Also relevant to these studies is the distance between the initiating Shine Dalgarno sequence and the internal frameshift stimulatory Shine Dalgarno sequence since pairing is maintained for translocation over several nts and adequate space has to be present to prevent interference (394, 491, 495) .",

As E-site tRNA exits, leaving only the P-site tRNA in place, EF-G samples the ribosome multiple times during the extended pause state. EF-G sampling is concurrent with continued Lys tRNA sampling at the A-site while slippage occurs.

Frameshift generated IS911 transposase activity is \u223c200-fold higher when it acts in cis than when supplied in trans. Pausing associated with the frameshifting influences cis preference presumably by facilitating sequential folding and cotranslational binding of the transposase (190) . This in turn influences the (cis) preference for transposase to act directly on the IS element that encoded it rather than on other copies of the same element (190) . Selective rational is provided by cells potentially having many copies of IS elements, and the need to tightly control transposition. Despite the elegance of this example, early pausing studies proved difficult. For a long time, some considered pausing as the key feature of programmed frameshifting with the nature of the shift site being the main determinant of the outcome of the non-standard event facilitated by the stall. Others hoped that the study of stimulators was not merely a study of different ways to induce a pause, with considerations of potential susceptibility to vacant A-site specific nuclease and tmRNA etc (see the 3rd next paragraph).",

One major paper on infectious bronchitis virus frameshifting concluded that ribosomal pausing at a frameshifter RNA pseudoknot is sensitive to reading phase but shows little correlation with frameshift efficiency (107) . In several cases 3 structures that do not stimulate frameshifting cause similar pausing (78, 107, 585) (a subset of these were mutants of stimulatory structures). With the IBV pseudoknot, optical tweezer results reporting a correlation between the force for mechanical unwinding and stimulatory effectiveness (586) were later challenged (541) . [A different situation pertains with simpler stem loop stimulators.] High resolution ribosome profiling of infected cells has just been performed but at the resolution of the technique no pausing at the frameshift site was detected though it was detected at other positions in the coding sequence (105) . Few studies have focused on structural features that may influence ribosomes in a different way, but one is of an isolated luteoviral frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot. This work suggested that a segment not central to pseudoknot stability may influence frameshifting by direct interaction with ribosome components (524) .",

A systematic study of this for Ty1 has just been completed (213) and only a few will be briefly mentioned here. Roles emerged for proteins such as Asc1/RACK1 (588) , and the mammalian and bacterial ribosomal proteins L4 and L9, respectively (484, 589) . There is an intriguing connection between L9, whose N-terminal domain binds to the L1 stalk and which stretches via a long alpha helical region 80 around the outside so that its Cterminal RNA binding domain can be near S6 on the small subunit (590) (Figure 17) , and the bacterial counterpart, EF-P, of hypusine containing eEF5 (591) . [The C-terminal domain of L9 restrains forward mRNA slippage (484) (Figure 17 ) and L9 is required for the growth of EF-P deficient cells (591) .] Such studies also pointed to the care needed to avoid indirect effects, though they can be insightful for other processes. Searches for mutants of S. cerevisiae that increase frameshifting on an MMTV shift cassette sequence, and independently of L-A virus frameshifting (with loss of a satellite virus that encodes a killer toxin), led to the isolation of mutants of the UPF1 and UPF2 genes (592, 593) . Follow up work led to controversy that was only resolved with the demonstration that UPF mutants do not affect frameshift- ing, though they do affect product levels (594, 595) . [UPF genes are key mediators of NMD (nonsense mediated decay) and their name is derived from 'up-frameshift mutant suppressor' to reflect one of the paths taken to their discovery (596) .]",

Work with synthetic constructs revealed 'stophops' where matched codons flank a stop and 9 nts specify one amino acid (54) , pointed to the significance of slow-todecode A-site codons. Over-expression, for biotechnological purposes, of a mammalian gene in E. coli soon thereafter showed that heterologous expression mediated specific aminoacyl-tRNA limitation led to counterpart hopping over a sense codon (597) . Another group studied indepth the requirements for counterpart bypassing both in starvation conditions and in normal growing cells (598) (599) (600) (601) . Lack of follow-up on reports of a 29 nt translational hop in decoding of an adhesion gene of the oral bacterium Prevotella loescheii, that is of dental interest (602), was partly due to difficulty in getting it to function in E. coli. The possibility of hopping in the expression of Leishmania RNA virus LRV2-1 was considered (603) but not investigated. Much work was required to show that two separate reports of bypassing utilization were spurious (604, 605) .",

The absence of perfectly matched take-off and landing codons in several cases and perhaps a greater propensity for codon: anticodon dissociation, are likely related to relaxed wobble rules with two-out-of-three base pairing and features of mitochondrial ribosomes (56, 65) , for which earlier studies with Mycoplasma are relevant (412) .

In contrast to triplet tRNA anticodon: codon interaction, the hybrid lengths central to DNA dependent RNA polymerases, and RNA dependent DNA polymerases, are much longer and of course without the counterpart of an adjacent tRNA (Thermus thermophilus RNAP hybrid oscilates between 9 and 10 bp during forward and backward translocation on DNA). Post initiation region slippage by bacterial RNA polymerase was initially detected in vitro (612) and shown to occur with high efficiency in vivo with a run of 9 As or Ts (613) . Productive utilization of slippage at 9 Ts in the Thermus thermophilus dnaX gene yields a heterogeneous population of mRNAs with 1 or multiple additional As in a diminishing proportion such that standard translation yields about 50% of the product being full length (323). Without context features, slippage is not detectable at TTTTTCC-CCC (T5C5). However, an IS element from Roseiflexus bacteria utilizes context-dependent slippage at this sequence to generate transcripts lacking a C residue within the corresponding U5C4 mRNA. Standard translation of these mR-NAs yields its transposase (99) . The enabling context feature is formation of a nascent RNA stem loop structure from the inverted repeat sequence, GCGGGCgcaaGCC-CGC 5 adjacent to the U5C5/U5C4 motif (99) (Figure 18 ).",

            "text": "[This is just one of the types of regulatory events that can come from RNA polymerase: nascent RNA structure interactions, with RNA polymerase progression involving a 'rugged kinetic landscape' (614) .] This programmed unidirectional specific slippage occurs uniquely at the C4 position of the T5C5 motif. Inviability of more than one rU:dG and even one rC:dA mismatch prevents a two-base deletion and any insertions, respectively, making it quite distinct from the slippage on 9 Ts in T. thermophilus dnaX. While transient realignment occurs on a broad variety of heteropolymeric sequences, rapid reversal prevents deletions and insertions in the mRNA unless additional sequence elements that inhibit the reversal are present. S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase can also slip on a cassette with the same T5C5 sequence (99) . The proposed mechanical model involving the RNAP translocation state differs from that proposed for Paramyxovirinae 'programmed transcriptional frameshifting', where, following random movement, efficiency is mainly dependent on the stability of the new realigned hybrid. The Sendai virus slippage sequence is 3 (Uug)UUUUUUCCC 5 and 30% of the mRNA synthesized from the P-gene has an additional G residue that causes ribosomes, by standard translation, to enter the coding sequence for the host-defense inactivating V protein. This is the sole Sendai virus alternative product to P, an essential viral polymerase co-factor, for synthesis that initiates with the P-gene start site (615) . However, with parainfluenza virus type 3 there is an additional product due to the realignment within its P-gene yielding separate RNAs that permit standard translational access to both alternative ORFs. This realignment involves 1 to 6 Gs being added with approximately equal frequency. Most of the relevant features are in its (Uaa)U 6 C 3 slippage sequence and when Sendai's UugU 6 C 3 is replaced within the Sendai virus context by UaaU 6 C 3 , the slippage becomes parainfluenza virus type 3-like. The relevant context feature is the phasing of the binding of multiple nucleocapsid proteins (N) that sheath the genomic negative-strand (and positivestrand antigenome) of these viruses. Such binding prevents complementary progeny positive-strand mRNAs from annealing with the genomic RNA. Each adjacent N protein binds precisely 6 nts of genomic RNA (615) , and adjusting the phasing of hexamer binding to two particular phases, causes the pattern of G inserts in progeny RNA to revert to the Sendai-virus pattern. Even when N is displaced from the genomic RNA by polymerase, it apparently remains closely associated with the polymerase and its hexamer phasing is thought to influence polymerase pausing at the slippage site with realignment consequences (616, 163) . The genome length is such that there is full phasing coverage and for the different species their respective phasing number is coordinated with that required for realignment by the relevant polymerase ( Figure 19 ). N binding is also relevant to avoidance of G insertion genomic fixation, with deleterious consequences for P protein synthesis, as only genomes with length an exact multiple of 6 nts are efficiently replicated (616) . A few paramyxoviruses, including Nipah virus, a member of the less well known Henipavirus genus, exhibit hyper transcriptional slippage, with some unresolved mechanistic issues (617, 618) .",

Ty3 frameshifting efficiency varies up to 10-fold depending on the carbon source, but in contrast to Ty2, it is lower in glucose grown cells than in poorer carbon-source media (625) . Previously it was shown that Ty3 Pol and transposition decreases dramatically with high temperature or growth in ethanol (626) where the frameshifting rate is greatly reduced (216) . (Possible cold shock effects have in general not been studied to date.) Genetic studies strongly indicate that under growth in the poorer carbon sources, one or two kinases phosphorylate the ribosome-associated protein Stm1p which in turn affects the Ty3 frameshifting level (216) . Stm1p is involved in the regulation of eEF3, a yeast-specific elongation factor that facilitates binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site. How many other cases of retrotransposon frameshifting are responsive to alterations of the translation elongation process is a significant unresolved issue. Perhaps mechanistically quite distinct, but an indication of the potential diversity is that there is elevated D. melanogaster 1731 retrotransposon gag-pol frameshifting in males compared to females (627) .",

Of relevance to ribosomal frameshifting at U-rich sequences are studies in thermophilic archaea (633, 634) and in Drosophila (635) which have shown organism-specific differences in the degree of conversion of 1-methyl G to wye in the tRNA Phe anticodon loop.

However, in a number of retroviruses, including Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), GagPol is synthesized via in-frame readthrough of a UAG stop codon (92, 93) rather than via frameshifting. It uses a stimulatory pseudoknot that is only rather ineffectively substituted by its counterpart mouse mammary tumor virus frameshifting stimulatory pseudoknot even though they are similarly positioned 3 of the recoding sites (637) . Substituting instead the HIV frameshift stimulatory signals resulted in readthrough levels only 2-to 3-fold lower than WT (638) . Experiments with two plant viruses that utilize readthrough to express their RNA dependent RNA polymerase, showed that recoding signals of one of them, carnation Italian ringspot virus (genus Tombusvirus) was partially functional for stimulating frameshifting whereas that of the other, tobacco necrosis virus D (genus Betanecrovirus), was not (639) . The similar recoding signals are bipartite and analogous to frameshifting stimulatory counterparts in barley yellow dwarf virus (genus Luteovirus) (110) and red clover necrotic mosaic virus (genus Dianthovirus) (554) with the 4 kb distant pairing.",

It is only moderately selected against, though it is absent from the 306 most highly expressed genes (464) . In lowly expressed genes, quite a number of occurrences of unselected cases of frameshifting appear to have a marginal effect at most and may be effectively of neutral consequence (464) . A further study of 7 Shigella, 1 Salmonella and a number of Escherichia genomes found AAAAAAA and UU-UUUUU, to be underrepresented in all three frames (195) . The poor frameshifters C CCG GGC and C CCG GGU were also found to be underrepresented and U UUC CCG to be markedly overrepresented. However, as considered in that publication other factors related to particular pairs of codons are also relevant.",

While the large battery of proteases would rapidly destroy most proteins, this may not apply to all whether abberant or normally utilized, with potentially significant effects in special cases perhaps even for neurodegenerative disease (369) . Treatment of Clostridium perfringens infected horses with gentamycin or streptomycin caused in-frame restorative frameshifting in the decoding of a cryptic gene whose product is involved in the synthesis of a toxin that causes more accentuated and fatal progression of equine typhlocolitis (694) . At a substantial majority of frameshift sites, streptomycin does not cause detectable frameshifting, but at some it does (671) and is not surprising (369), due to aminoglycosides causing increased acceptance of near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA and reduced acceptance time (402, 695) . However, even gentamycin and paromomycin which in general are more effective than streptomycin, commonly cause only very modest increases in frameshifting (696) . The oxazolidinones, linezolid and especially R chi-01 promote more but still often modest levels of frameshifting (696, 697) .",

This presentation of peptides enables lymphocytemediated immunosurveillance important for viral and tumor immunity. It is upregulated by interferons and certain other cytokines. In addition to peptides being derived from mature 'retiree' proteins, a proportion of the peptides come from proteins being synthesized, or directly afterward. Part of the initial reason for appreciating this came from the rapid time after viral infection that infected cells display viral antigens recognized by specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, with viral counter-attack being relevant (701) . This led to the DRiP (Defective Ribosomal Products) hypothesis (702) which was later broadened to include products derived from ribosomal frameshifting (703, 704) , transcriptional indels (705), various other non-standard events and notably potential specialized ribosomes 'immuno-ribosomes' (706) . Detection is highly sensitive and antibiotic treatment can affect such peptide display (707) . There are numerous fascinating and important unanswered questions about the origin of peptides selected for display, and the extent of relevance of cotranslational protein degradation (708) and of frameshifting are only a couple of the unknowns.",

However, from the discovery of the general nature of decoding (159) until two years after completion in 1966 of the deciphering of codon assignments, the pendulum swung too far and it was thought that framing was so hard-wired that frameshifting did not, and could not be made to, occur. The practical manifestation at the time, some 'ten' years in advance of the development of DNA sequencing, was the perception that a mutation could not be a frameshift mutation if it was leaky (allowed the synthesis of some full-length product), or could not be suppressible by a secondary 'suppressor' mutation of some translational component, i.e by mutation of a gene at a separate location from the gene containing the original frameshift mutation (709) (710) (711) . These misconceptions of sacrosanct framing were corrected with the discovery of (i) frameshift mutant extragenic suppressors (712, 713) that, as expected, were later shown to be mutants of various translation components that compensate for a framing 'problem' (439, 440) , (ii) frameshifting by the WT translational apparatus as evidenced by frameshift mutant 'leakiness' (393, 714) and (iii) the first identified viral encoded frameshift products (73, 74) . However, it took the advent of general availability of synthetic oligonucleotides of specified sequence and more extensive sequencing in 1984 to facilitate the discoveries that brought utilized frameshifting to widespread interest. While this occurred in 1985 with yeast Ty (206, 715) , release factor 2 (350) and retroviral frameshifting (76) , followup work was needed to show at what level it occurred, see above, by which time coronaviral frameshifting was discovered (103) . Parallel developments with other phenomena permitted appreciation of common features involved in various ways of utilizating non-standard decoding, and the dynamic competition with standard decoding. This led to a new word, recoding or reprogrammed genetic decoding (716) (717) (718) . In contrast to this use for naturally occurring organisms, the same word was later used somewhat differently in connection with human intervention to 'genomically recode organisms' (719), though several of the authors involved are now using a different term for that meaning (720) . [Distinctions between natural recoding and complete reassignment of the meaning of a codon wherever it occurs irrespective of context, have been highlighted (721) while word usage evolves, clarity about the intended meaning is key.]",

Not only was there presumably a lesser ability to restrain such activity, it could have been useful in partially circumventing problem deficiencies in substrate supply. Irrespective of whether one envisages a small proto-tmRNA-like structure being relevant to primordial protein synthesis (722, 723) , since glycine was likely one of the early amino acids (724) , it is possible that Shine Dalgarno-like interactions served to restrain mRNA 'drift away' with G-rich mRNA sequences being present. Did Shine Dalgarno mRNA:rRNA pairing play a role in the elongation stage of protein synthesis before serving a role in initiation (725) ? Whether any extant productively utilized frameshifting predated those cases derived from triplet decoding where a framing error was selected and its efficiency enhanced with recoding signals, is unknown (at least it seems likely that frameshifting was utilized in expression of the common ancestor of release factor 2 (355)). However, it is not for us to tell nature what is ideal -'programmed error' would be an inappropriate descriptor that would detract from the illustration of decoding versatility provided by the mechanisms used for frameshifting and other types of recoding.",

            "text": "To minimize the need for a proto ribosome to stabilize triplet codon: anticodon interactions, Crick and colleagues developed a proto tRNA anticodon alternating stacking scheme that allowed for quintuplet pairing but only triplet decoding thus avoiding destruction of previously coded information on transition to triplet only pairing (726) . Despite the elegance of this scheme, several of the different models for the origin of decoding are relevant for those with the mindset of a less sacrosanct view of framing and an appreciation that Crick's frozen accident thesis (727) has considerably melted (728) . These models involve stereochemical interactions between amino acids and RNA, proto mR-NAs evolving as linkers between peptidated RNAs and tR-NAs derived from replicators involving parallel duplication (729) (730) (731) . Further to the framing latitude considered in the last paragraph due to dissociation and re-pairing, there has been consideration of greater than triplet codon: anticodon interactions by proto tRNAs (722, 723) , and perhaps even of tRNA mimics (486) . While at least the great majority of frameshifting with WT translational components considered above involves at least one tRNA anticodon dissociating and re-pairing in a new frame, that of Ty3 has been proposed not to do so (214) and there is considerable doubt about a case of non-cognate frameshifting (452, 453) . Similarily among the frameshift mutant suppressors that have altered tRNAs, though some involve anticodon racheting, in at least the great majority the evidence points to no more than 3 anticodon loop nts being paired to mRNA at one time (440, 732) .",

(A) Cryo-EM visualization of the L9 carboxy-terminal domain contacting ribosomal proteins (L9 is purple) versus the elongated form of L9 (in pink) detected in crystals. In crystals, instead of the L9 carboxy-terminal domain interacting with the 30S subunit of the same ribosome, it interacts with the 16S rRNA of a neighbouring ribosome. Whether this is a crystal artifact or indicative of a 'strut' function in polysomes relevant to frameshifting is unknown. (B) Model of L9 in the context of polysomes. This shows the arrangement of neighboring ribosomes (i-1 and i) in the major t-t form of E. coli polysomes, with the conformation of L9 (blue) revealed by cryo-EM. L9 is located close to protein S4 of the neighboring 30S subunit (30S i) according to the polysome model. The purple arrow indicates the rearrangement of L9 from the cryo-EM conformation to that seen in crystals. The black arrow denotes the location of the mRNA entry channel in the 30S subunit i. Images A and B are from(590). (C) Mass spectral analysis of protein products shows evidence for L9 functioning to restrain forward ribosome slippage on mRNA.
