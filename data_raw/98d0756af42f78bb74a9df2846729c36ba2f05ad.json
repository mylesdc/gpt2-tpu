No influenza case developed symptoms on or after the 5th day of voyage, and the observed cases were thought to have been exposed to influenza before departure. Although the original data for the 1st day of voyage (i.e., 64 cases) partly included cases who developed the disease in port, it was assumed that their onset information was equivalent to that of those who developed the disease on the 1st day at sea [A2] . The duration of each voyage was assumed to be sufficiently longer than the incubation period of influenza (e.g., more than 5 days).",
