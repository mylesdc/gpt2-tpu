Detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells (WBC) and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present, suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs. The aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from Sardinia (Italy) for the presence of both FPV and CPV DNA within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA viral load, genetic diversity, phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats. Results: Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in nine cats (16.7%). Viral DNA was reassembled to FPV in four cats and to CPV (CPV-2b and 2c) in four cats; one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving FPV and CPV-2c. Antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to DNA parvoviruses. Conclusions: The identification of FPV and CPV DNA in the WBC of asymptomatic cats, despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses, and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample, confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection.",

Nevertheless, parvoviruses can be detected in faeces forup to 6 weeks after recovery, depending on the sensitivity of the diagnostic method used [10] . Cats experimentally infected with FPV shed the virus in both urine and faeces up to day 41-42 post-infection with parvovirus persisting in the lungs and kidneys for more than 50 weeks in cats which have recovered [11] . The detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats suggests that parvovirus infection may be common in some populations of clinically normal cats, and that asymptomatic cats may be able to shed parvovirus for prolonged periods of time [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, the ability of FPV and CPV to persist in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of cats irrespective of the presence of neutralising antibodies [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and the presence of parvoviral DNA in the bone marrow of healthy cats [18] , suggests that parvovirus may persist long term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs.",

Date of sampling, gender, age, breed, habitat and the clinical symptoms of the 54 cats sampled are reported in Table 1 . According to these data, the animals were divided into two groups called A and B. The cats included in Groups A were predominantly healthy cats from four multi-cat households. The cats in Group B were sampled in the Emergency Room of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine (UNISS) and were predominantly stray cats showing different clinical signs (sick cats). Twenty-two of the 54 (40.7%) cats were clinically normal; 26/54 (48.1%) showed clinical signs attributable to various diseases; 3/54 (5.6%) showed gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting and diarrhoea compatible with parvovirus infection; clinical status was unavailable for 3/54 (5.6%) cats.

In the second amplification, the PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles with 1 cycle at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, at 49\u00b0C for 1 min, and at 72\u00b0C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. In both PCR reactions, FPV 1033/09 [3] was used as a positive control while ultrapure water was used in each experiment to avoid false positive results. The nucleotide sequences were obtained using both forward and reverse primers.",

This strain was used in HI experiments because there are no significant differences in serum titres inhibiting the haemagglutination reaction when cats are infected by FPV or CPV, if CPV is used as an antigen [22] . To calculate 8 haemagglutinating units (HAU) of the viral antigen, a haemagglutination (HA) assay was carried out on the CPV-2b isolate following procedures described previously by Carmichael et al. [22] . Porcine erythrocytes were washed three times in Bis-Tris Buffered Saline (BTBS, pH 6.2 at 4\u00b0C) and suspended into 0.5% (v/v) BTBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin.

All the cats which tested positive for parvovirus DNA had Table 3 Change of amino acids to VP2 partial protein The presence of FPV and CPV DNA in the faecal and peripheral blood samples of healthy cats has previously been reported [3, 12, [15] [16] [17] , raising important questions regarding the role of cats in the epidemiology of parvoviruses. In our study, the absence of clinical signs consistent with parvovirosis in the cats which tested positive, together with the low amount of viral DNA detected, suggested that the infection was asymptomatic or that residual viral DNA remains in the organism after recovery from acute infection. Furthermore, the detection of parvoviral DNA in WBC reveals the presence of the virus in the bone marrow or in other lymphoid tissues which might reflect chronic or latent infection. The detection of CPV DNA in apparently healthy domestic cats confirmed a previous survey in which a high prevalence (37%) of CPV in apparently healthy domestic cats living in rescue shelters was identified [14] . Canine parvovirus-like DNA was also detected in the tissues of wildlife carnivores which had no Fig. 1 Unrooted phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the nucleotide sequences of the partial VP2 gene generated in this study and with feline and canine parvovirus reference sequences available on the GenBank nucleotide database or analysed by the authors in a previous study (Battilani et al., [3] ). Bootstrap values greater than 50%, calculated on 1000 replicates, are indicated on the respective branches. The feline and canine parvoviruses identified in Italy not detected in this study but included in the phylogenetic analysis are designated by IT. In bold: Nucleotide sequences generated in this study. Underlined: clone 41/2011-C8 clinical signs of active infection and, therefore, it was likely that this virus caused latent or persistent infection not only in domestic cats [26] . Animal parvoviruses, such as Rodent protoparvovirus and Aleutian mink disease parvovirus, have been shown to persist in their host [27, 28] . Persistence is a common feature also for human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection [29] : B19V parvoviral DNA has been documented in a wide range of tissues and the bone marrow of asymptomatic adults, although the majority of people harbour parvoviral DNA in a form which does not actively replicate [30, 31] .",

These results led to the speculation that CPV, compared to FPV, can most frequently cause asymptomatic and persistent infection in cats, even if additional studies are clearly needed to fully understand the potential of cats as CPV carriers. In our study, an equivalent prevalence of FPV and CPV was found in the samples examined; this result might be related to the type of cat population sampled, which consisted mainly of healthy cats and cats showing clinical signs not related to parvovirosis. Alternatively, it could be due to the biological matrix analysed since parvoviruses have commonly been investigated in the faeces of infected animals; instead, in our survey the WBC were analysed.",

This result was congruent with the evolutive behaviour of FPV which, since its emergence in 1920, has not undergone significant changes in antigenic and biological properties. Feline panleukopenia virus varied at a slow rate by random genetic drift and it maintained host-specificity [38] . Instead, in the CPV sequence data set, non-synonymous mutations were predominant. This finding is compatible with the pattern of evolution observed for CPV. Since its emergence in the late 1970s, CPV evolution has been driven by strong positive selection, giving rise to new antigenic variants which have replaced the original type [38] .",

Carnivore parvoviruses are very prone to genetic evolution, showing substitution rates similar to those of RNA viruses, with values of approximately 10 \u2212 4 substitutions per site per year. This result, together with the detection of CPV-2c, which has already been reported in multiple infections of high genetic complexity [3, 5, 39] , confirmed that co-infection with different species of parvovirus in feline hosts led to a high genetic variability and to the potential emergence of new viruses [3] .",
