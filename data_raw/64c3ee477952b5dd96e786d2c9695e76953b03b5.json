The transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus can protect the infant from many infectious diseases for the first vulnerable months of its life. Passive immunization has been used in the global effort to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus. Researchers have estimated that vaccinating pregnant women with two or more doses of tetanus-containing vaccine has reduced neonatal mortality from tetanus by 94%. 1 In addition, clinicians have used passive immunization, to prevent or to treat various infections for over a century for diseases such as rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus and botulism. Passive immunization is also used in immunocompromised individuals and to manage complications after vaccination.",

[5] [6] [7] The production and use of polyclonal antibodies have revealed several challenges, including standardization, patient safety, supply and access. These challenges have led researchers to explore the possibility of replacing polyclonal antibodies with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which can be produced through recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technologies. In the past, producing mAbs was difficult and expensive. However, the increasing use of mAbs as therapeutics for cancer, autoimmune diseases and other chronic diseases has led to increased production capacities and improved manufacturing processes. 8 These advancements have made mAbs potentially cost-competitive with blood-derived polyclonal antibod-ies, while at the same time contributing towards an improved supply at a global level. Over 40 therapeutic mAbs are currently in use, targeting a range of noncommunicable diseases.",

In August 2014, two American health-care workers infected with Ebola were treated with Zmapp\u2122, an experimental drug containing three mAbs against Ebola. 9 Unfortunately, the drug supply was only sufficient to treat seven patients and efforts had to be made to increase production before clinical evaluation could take place. 10 Efficacy trials in Ebola infected patients in West Africa were completed in January 2016. However, due to the waning epidemic, the trial could only enroll 72 patients out of the planned 200. The outcomes showed that out of the 36 patients who received Zmapp\u2122, eight died, which was less than in the group receiving only standard care (13 of 35 patients died). However, the trial sample size was too low to draw any conclusions. 11 Despite this setback, anti-Ebola mAb development -which has been ongoing for several years and the first neutralizing mAb reported in 1999 12 -continues towards the goal of licensure under alternative pathways to standard randomized controlled clinical trials.",

The small number of patients, the unpredictable outbreaks and epidemiology and the high fatality associated with the ethical challenges of conducting randomized clinical trials, are obstacles when evaluating mAbs as a treatment for such diseases. Therefore, alternative regulatory pathways for product licensure are needed. However, many countries do not have mechanisms in place for such pathways and there is no framework in place for testing, licensure and use of mAbs. In addition, consensus on acceptable clinical endpoints and definition of conditions under which mAbs would be used, are lacking.

Fourth, high costs may limit access, especially to those in low-resource settings. Although the production costs of mAbs have been reduced over the last decade, the cost is still high (about 100 United States dollars per gram), 8 especially if several grams are needed for treatment. The number of grams required will differ greatly depending on the target pathogen. Methods to decrease the cost include enabling lower doses by increasing the affinity of the mAbs or changing the production system to increase yields and/or decrease the cost of goods.
