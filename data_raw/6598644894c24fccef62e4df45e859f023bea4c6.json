When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the 'riskiest' contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available.",

Such 'species jumps' have been proposed as a major source of novel pathogen introductions (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Kuiken et al. 2006) , and indeed many emerging human diseases are zoonotic (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001) . Typically, these pathogens are initially poorly adapted to humans because of physiological differences between species (Kuiken et al. 2006) . Thus, significant spread of these pathogens within the human population often requires evolutionary adaptation (Dennehy 2009) .",

For the same reason, patterns of contact among hosts should also play an important role in disease emergence, because some contact structures ought to lead to greater scope for transmission than others.

It has been suggested that the high incidence of emergence among viruses may be attributed, at least partially, to their high mutation rates ( particularly in RNA viruses). A high mutation rate might lead to a greater likelihood of the appropriate adaptive mutations occurring, implying greater evolutionary potential (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005) . On the other hand, most mutations are deleterious, and a high mutation rate could thereby increase the chance of pathogen extinction (Dennehy 2009 ). Indeed, this propensity for extinction might be exploited clinically by drug-induced 'lethal mutagenesis' (Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008) . Thus, it remains unclear whether higher mutation rates do indeed lead to a higher likelihood of evolutionary emergence, or whether other processes are required to explain the empirical patterns.",

We ask two main questions: (i) what types of host contact structure lead to the greatest risk of evolutionary emergence? and (ii) how do patterns of mutation affect the risk of evolutionary emergence? We address these questions using a branching process model that tracks the number of infected hosts as a newly introduced pathogen spreads and evolves. There have been two main approaches to using such models in the epidemiological literature, a network-based approach and a phenomenological approach. The former explicitly considers the patterns of contact among individuals in the population and the probability of transmission through any given contact (e.g. Brauer 2008 ), but has not, to date, allowed for evolution. The latter assumes that the population is well mixed and in some cases allows for evolution, but has not explicitly modelled the contact patterns among individuals (e.g. Antia et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Yates et al. 2006; Reluga et al. 2007) . In order to address the above questions, we place these two approaches within a common framework, generalizing to allow for arbitrary contact patterns and arbitrary pathways of evolutionary adaptation.",

Rather, it directly specifies a distribution of number of new infections, X, produced by an infected individual. The approach typically uses a Poisson distribution of infections, implicitly assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, but sometimes incorporates individual heterogeneity by allowing the mean of the distribution itself to be a random variable. For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) generally draw the mean, n, from a Gamma distribution with mean R 0 and dispersion parameter b; then X has a negative binomial distribution with mean R 0 and dispersion b. As special cases, b \u00bc 1 corresponds to n Exp(R 0 ) and X Geometric(R 0 ), while b ! 1 corresponds to n \u00bc R 0 (no individual variation) and X Poisson(R 0 ). In any case, the key difference from the network-based approach is that G(s) is effectively specified directly. As before, one then defines the basic reproductive number as R 0 \u00bc G 0 (1). Notice, however, that unlike the networkbased approach, no distinction is made here between generation 0 infectives (i.e. those who receive the infection from an outside source) and later-generation infectives. (In special cases of the network model, all generations are in fact equivalent; see appendix A.2.) If we consider only later-generation infectives, the phenomenological approach can be obtained via the network-based approach, provided that the contact distribution in the latter is chosen to obtain the same end result for the offspring distribution (appendix A.3).",

Thus, as before, degree is described by the PGF g(z) and the excess degree by G(z) for every individual, regardless of type. We retain the assumption that transmissions occur independently to each contact, and further assume that transmissibility T is strain-specific, denoted T i for strain i. Thus, the probability of making an infectious contact depends only on the current infective's strain type. However, a different strain may be transmitted as a result of pathogen mutation. Specifically, given that a type i infective makes an infectious contact, strain j is transmitted with probability m ij ( P j m ij \u00bc 1, 8i). We call the m \u00c2 m matrix U \u00bc [m ij ] the 'mutation matrix', representing the mutational pathway(s) allowed in the evolution of the pathogen and their probabilities.",

The most accurate interpretation of our approach would be that a host currently infected with strain i transmits only strain i, but that each infective produced in the next generation has probability m ij of converting to strain j over the course of infection, before any further transmission occurs. In this approach, m ij is an 'effective conversion rate' from strain i to strain j within one host, summarizing the results of within-host dynamics ( \u00a74.3).

Figure 2a shows how R 0 increases with transmissibility T: in all cases, this increase is linear, but at a different rate for each contact distribution depending on the variance in contacts. Figure 2b plots the probability of emergence versus T for each contact distribution. This probability becomes non-zero at the point where R 0 passes the critical value of one, which occurs at a different value of T for each distribution (as illustrated in figure 2a) . Thus, at low values of T, the disease can persist in some host contact structures but not others, despite the fact that they all have the same mean number of contacts. As T increases, however, the probability of emergence increases at different rates for different contact structures, such that the ordering is not preserved. This observation is highlighted in the inset, showing emergence probability over an extended range of T. In contrast, the ordering is consistent in figure 2c , which plots the probability of emergence versus R 0 , comparable to Brauer's presentation (Brauer 2008) . The same value of R 0 has been achieved for each contact distribution by varying T to compensate. We can think of the middle plot as showing the net result of opposing influences illustrated in figure 2a,c. Similar considerations and results on the impact of contact distribution and transmissibility apply to the multiple strain case.",

A high rate of reverse mutation from a well-adapted to a poorly adapted strain can tip the branching process from supercritical to subcritical. Population R 0 increases almost linearly with T m , but is relatively insensitive to number of strains (m), earlier strain transmissibility (T 1 ) and forward mutation probability (m).

To obtain this probability, 1 2 q 1 , we compute the extinction probabilityq numerically, through fixed-point iterations of the offspring distribution PGF, G\u00f0s\u00de ( \u00a72.2). We initiate an iteration from a points with s i , 1, 8i, to ensure convergence to the appropriate fixed point (see appendix D for details), and continue until the difference between successive iterations, in max norm, is less than a specified tolerance, taken to be 10 212 or 10 216 in the figures we present. Figure 4 illustrates the probability of emergence across various linear mutation schemes with the same contact distribution. Here, T m is far from the critical threshold, and reverse mutation, even at a high rate equal to that of forward mutation, makes a negligible impact on the probability of emergence. This agrees with Sagitov and Serra's result that reverse mutation is negligible in a similar model with an arbitrary offspring distribution (Sagitov & Serra 2009) , and with the neglect of pathways to the escape mutant exceeding the minimum length in the work of Iwasa et al. (2003 Iwasa et al. ( , 2004 . On the other hand, results are highly sensitive to the path of forward mutation that is assumed to be possible. Allowing jumps directly to strain m tends to make a particularly large difference, with this effect most pronounced when early strains have very low transmissibility. Simultaneous point mutations, though extremely rare, also make a significant contribution to the probability of emergence.

Now that we have generalized the mutation scheme, we can investigate whether this effect is more pronounced for some schemes than for others. For instance, a decrease in intermediate strain transmissibility (creating a fitness valley) hurts the pathogen's chance of emergence more if only one-step forward mutation is possible, as opposed to a jump directly to the final strain through recombination (results not shown).

As an extreme case, we set transmissibility of all deleterious strains to be zero. Figure 8 plots the probability of emergence versus T 1 for various mutation probabilities. When T 1 is well below the critical threshold (at which R 0,1 reaches 1), emergence probability increases linearly with mutation probability, as we would predict from analytical approximations ( \u00a73.5). Although this figure plots results for m \u00bc 10 strains, a virtually identical increase in emergence probability versus m at fixed small T 1 was observed for m \u00bc 2, 3, 5 as well (results not shown). This indicates that regardless of how high the risk of deleterious steps, a pathogen that is guaranteed to go extinct unless it acquires a beneficial mutation (evolves to strain m) is always better off having a large mutation rate. Near the critical threshold, emergence probability shows a sharp jump; once strain 1 is sufficiently fit to escape extinction without further evolution, mutation probability makes only a small difference in results. Shortly after this point, a very high mutation probability becomes detrimental to the pathogen, even while strain 1 is not as well adapted as strain m. The risk of mutating to a poorly adapted strain now outweighs the potential benefit of mutating to a better adapted strain. Adding reverse mutation at a probability equal to that of forward mutation makes negligible difference to quantitative results (results not shown), as also observed with linear mutation schemes where R 0,m is not too close to one. We might suspect that increasing reverse mutation probability independently of forward mutation probability could provide a benefit to the pathogen if the transmissibility of deleterious strains is non-zero, such that mutation could 'rescue' the pathogen by a return to strain 1 (the hub). However, this does not appear to be the case within tested parameter ranges (results not shown): increasing reverse mutation probability decreases probability of emergence, though only marginally when R 0,m is well above one.",

That is, a pathogen's fitness depends on the particular host population in which it circulates, an observation that has been made more generally for pathogen fitness measures (Antolin 2008) . Similarly, in the multi-type process, we can express the mean matrix as M \u00bc (g 0 (1)(1 \u00fe c 2 ) 2 1)diag\u00f0T \u00deU , whereT is the vector of strain transmissibilities and U is the mutation matrix. These expressions make it clear that for fixed transmissibilities, mean number of contacts and mutation scheme, maximizing pathogen fitness is equivalent to maximizing the variance of the host population's contact distribution; this agrees with the general observation that increasing heterogeneity among hosts increases R 0 (Antolin 2008) . Furthermore, in the multi-type process, we see that criticality is independent of mutation probabilities if mutation is uni-directional; however, if mutation is bi-directional then this can push the process into a subcritical range (figure 3).",

Given a mutational scheme, probability of emergence is also sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of intermediate strains in an analytically predictable manner (figures 5 and 6). We also considered more realistic situations where deleterious as well as beneficial evolutionary steps are available to the pathogen, either by reverse mutation or by including multiple pathways in strain space. Here, we constrained all types of mutations to occur with proportional probabilities, based on some overall mutation rate of the pathogen. We found that, when the pathogen was initially poorly adapted, increasing overall mutation rate was usually beneficial to an emerging pathogen (i.e. riskier to the host). On the other hand, as the pathogen's initial fitness increases beyond the critical threshold where survival without adaptation is possible, the risk of deleterious mutations comes to outweigh the benefit of potential mutation to a more fit strain, and a high mutation rate becomes a liability (figure 8). Thus, our results largely provide support for the hypothesis that the statistically higher propensity of RNA viruses to emerge is due to their high mutation rate (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005) . However, an exception occurs with pathogens for which the fully adapted strain has a basic reproductive number only slightly above one. In this situation, when allowing for reverse mutation, we observed another phenomenon in which emergence probability has a non-monotonic relationship with overall mutation rate (figure 7). If this rate passes a critical point, excessive back mutation to poorly adapted strains implies that the pathogen can no longer sustain itself. This result parallels the phenomenon of 'error catastrophe' observed in viral quasi-species models, which offer a theoretical explanation for experimental success in inducing lethal mutagenesis in viruses (Eigen 2002; Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008) . Although the required 'mutation' rate may at first appear unrealistically high, it is important to remember that it does not represent the probability of point mutation during a single replication event, but actually incorporates all factors involved in strain conversion, including genetic changes arising during multiple rounds of replication and within-host strain competition. Taken together, our results suggest that any attempt to alter a pathogen's mutation rate for host benefit should be undertaken with careful consideration of the pathogen's initial fitness and the availability of mutations, both beneficial and deleterious. An attempt to induce lethal mutagenesis seems liable to backfire if the pathogen has significant adaptive potential, as in the case of many emerging pathogens.",

Indeed, although a better understanding of the dynamics of cross-species transmission is likely to be important in dealing with emerging diseases, few models to date have considered multiple species and phases in cross-over (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ). (However, see Day et al. (2006) and Reluga et al. (2007) for models incorporating ongoing interactions with animal reservoirs.) Putting our model in a broader context could elucidate the impact of additional risk factors such as pathogen -host range (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001) .",

Given the importance of contact structure that we and others have predicted, consideration of more realistic networks may be an important next step. Using a branching process neglects higher order network features, such as loops that persist even in large populations, thus implicitly assuming that the availability of susceptibles is not limited by local saturation. Clustering of contacts is expected to limit disease spread owing to reduction in the availability of susceptibles (Keeling & Eames 2005) , and including features such as triangles in networks may have a dramatic impact in decreasing the probability of a large-scale epidemic (Trapman 2007 ). Thus, we expect the branching process approach to provide an upper bound on the risk of emergence. On the other hand, a recent analysis addressing some apparent inconsistencies in the literature suggests that the impact of clustering on the probability of an epidemic is in fact negligible unless degree is typically small or hostbased heterogeneities are large (Miller 2009 ), providing some support for conclusions drawn from a branching process approach. While some authors (e.g. Ball & Neal 2002; Trapman 2007; Miller 2009 ) have made progress in modelling stochastic single-strain disease spread with more complicated contact structures, to our knowledge such approaches have not yet been extended to multiple strains.",

Realistically, once a mutation arises in a host there will be some dynamical process leading to fixation or loss over time, with coexistence of strains at least temporarily.

In recent years, a number of authors have developed such 'nested models' (reviewed in Mideo et al. 2008) ; however, these are typically deterministic, whereas we suggest that stochasticity may be important at both levels. A pathogen may then increase its fitness via multiple routes (Antolin 2008) , with potential for conflicting selection at different scales (Gilchrist & Coombs 2006; Coombs et al. 2007) . We anticipate that antagonistic selection at the within-versus between-host scales would tend to reduce the probability of population-level emergence, as the more transmissible strain (better able to avoid extinction between hosts) is thwarted by dominance of other strain(s) within the host. By extending our model to the within-host scale, we can address these sorts of trade-offs in greater detail, offering further perspectives on risk factors contributing to evolutionary emergence.",

More generally, for arbitrary T, we require that G(1 2 T \u00fe Ts) \u00bc G(s), if G( . ) exists for this choice of G( . ). Rearranging z \u00bc 1 2 T \u00fe Ts yields s \u00bc (z 2 (1 2 T ))/T. Thus, G(z) \u00bc G((z 2 (1 2 T ))/T) if G(z) exists; that is, if this expression yields a valid PGF. Taking z [ [0,1] as we would usually evaluate a PGF leads to s \u00bc (z 2 (1 2 T))/T [ [2(1 2 T )/T, 1], and G(s) may not be a valid PGF on this range. Taking G(s) to be, say, binomial or negative binomial leads to a valid PGF for G(z), for any T [ [0,1]. But taking G(s) \u00bc s N (exactly N infections transmitted by every infective) only gives a valid PGF if T \u00bc 1, not surprisingly. These examples illustrate that some, but not all, distributions of infectious transmissions can be traced back to contact distributions for arbitrary T. This limitation is to be expected, given that we have constrained the number of transmissions from an individual to be distributed binomially with total number of 'trials' equal to the number of contacts. Precise conditions on G(s) yielding a valid contact distribution G(z) in this or other models of transmission is an interesting mathematical question, but lies beyond the scope of the present work.",

First, we make the reasonable assumption that our process is never singular. Singular processes are those in which every individual has exactly one offspring (Harris 1963) , and are often excluded from analyses. Results for multi-type branching processes are usually stated for indecomposable processes, in which 'each type of individual eventually may have progeny of any other type' (Haccou et al. 2005, p. 26) , also known as irreducible processes (Mode 1971) . Such a process can be identified from the expectation matrix, M: the process is indecomposable if, for every pair of types (i,j), there exists a positive integer n such that M n (i,j) . 0; or equivalently, there is a non-zero probability of producing at least one type j in generation n, given that the process starts with one type i (Mode 1971; Haccou et al. 2005 ). If n is independent of the types (i,j), the process is called positively regular (Mode 1971) . Only periodic processes are indecomposable, but fail to be positively regular (Mode 1971) ; however, a periodic process can be represented by a non-periodic process through a transformation of time scale (Haccou et al. 2005) . Thus, from here on, we take indecomposable to mean positively regular. In our model, whenever mutation is reversible and all types are transmissible, we have an indecomposable process.",

Thus, the process is guaranteed to go extinct from every initial type if and only if R 0,m 1. Otherwise, there is a positive probability that the process does not go extinct, at least from some initial type. In fact, any initial type will suffice, provided the probability of forward mutation is positive and every strain is transmissible. For reversible mutation, again assuming strain m is best adapted, having R 0,m . 1 is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to obtain a positive probability of nonextinction (cf. figure 3) . Finally, if any type is non-transmissible (as we sometimes consider with hub-and-spoke schemes), clearly a process initiated by such a type is guaranteed to go extinct.

To summarize, in most cases, we will have R 0,m . 1 and R 0,i , 1 8i = m; this yields two solutions to the vector fixed-point equation:s \u00bc1 ands \u00bcq, the extinction probability, where q i , 1, 8i. Furthermore, fixed-point iteration beginning with anys with all components ,1 will converge to the latter solution, since iteration of G m (s m ) converges to q m . In the occasional case that we have more than one supercritical type, there will be more than two solutions, corresponding to different subsets of types persisting in the case of non-extinction (Reluga et al. 2007) . However, only one solutionq will have all components ,1, and this can readily be identified as the vector of probabilities that the entire process (every type) goes extinct, based on arguments presented above. Again, this is the solution that will be reached by fixed-point iteration beginning withs such that s i , 1, 8i, which is the method we apply in computations. In more complicated mutational schemes (not considered here), for instance if certain pathways are reversible and others are not, classes in a decomposable process may consist of more than one type; here we can write M in a block triangular form and apply results from Mode (1971) to make similar arguments.",

In indecomposable processes, all types will persist, and their populations grow asymptotically at a geometric rate r (Haccou et al. 2005) . However, this is not necessarily the case in decomposable processes. A simple inductive argument can be used to show that only supercritical types can persist if mutation is irreversible; so, in most cases we consider, 'emergence' means that only type m is present in the long term.
