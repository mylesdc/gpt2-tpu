            "text": "Now-outdated estimates proposed that climate change should have increased the number of people at risk of malaria, yet malaria and several other infectious diseases have declined. Although some diseases have increased as the climate has warmed, evidence for widespread climate-driven disease expansion has not materialized, despite increased research attention. Biological responses to warming depend on the non-linear relationships between physiological performance and temperature, called the thermal response curve. This leads performance to rise and fall with temperature. Under climate change, host species and their associated parasites face extinction if they cannot either thermoregulate or adapt by shifting phenology or geographic range. Climate change might also affect disease transmission through increases or decreases in host susceptibility and infective stage (and vector) production, longevity, and pathology. Many other factors drive disease transmission, especially economics, and some change in time along with temperature, making it hard to distinguish whether temperature drives disease or just correlates with disease drivers. Although it is difficult to predict how climate change will affect infectious disease, an ecological approach can help meet the challenge. scales, some models project expansions in climate suitability for malaria 18 , whereas other models, based on different curves, predict poleward (and altitudinal) shifts 14,19 or decreases 20 . These different predictions stem from different model assumptions. In particular, non-linearities in the performance curves for malaria and mosquitoes have suggested that optimal temperatures for transmission are much lower than previously thought 21,22 and that in future warming scenarios much of Africa will be too warm for efficient transmission 23 .

Meanwhile, malaria resurged in Greece after health services had been cut following the 2008 recession (though some have blamed a warming climate as well) 16 .

Early climate models predicted that warming would expand parasite and mosquito vector ranges beyond the tropics.

Finally, some diseases have emerged or increased 2 just as global greenhouse effects 3 , urban heat islands 4 , and devegetation 5 have increased temperatures over the last century, suggesting that this warmer world will be a sicker world 6 .

For example, although warming has expanded highland malaria transmission in some places, transmission did not increase into western Europe and the United States (Box 1) 10 . Instead, after rising with population growth, mortalities declined by 40% in Africa between 2000 and 2015, and this was largely due to insecticide-treated bed nets and other interventions 11 . The decline in malaria in a warming world shows how economic growth and interventions can mask climate effects. By contrast, other pathogens have expanded in recent years, particularly arboviruses such as West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, pandemic influenza viruses, Ebola virus, and coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). The resurgence and spread of these diseases are thought to be linked to global change (for example, urbanization, land use change, climate change, and global travel), but direct links to climate change have not been established 12 .

If such species are mobile, their geographic ranges should shift to higher latitudes and altitudes. In contrast, sedentary or island species might either adapt to warmer temperatures or go extinct. As parasite and host ranges shift, generalist parasites with broad host ranges should persist. By contrast, specialist parasites should be more sensitive because climate change could disrupt parasite transmission and reduce parasite burdens while also disrupting host populations. Host pathology could increase if infectious agents adapt faster to higher temperatures. This could be the case for long-lived, sedentary tropical hosts (like trees or corals) that have limited capacity to tolerate, adapt to, or move in response to temperature increases 6 . Depending on the system, parasite transmission, pathology, and geographic range could decline, increase, or stay the same, making general predictions challenging 34 .",

It is common to assume that warming will decrease immune function because cellular and humoral immune defenses are expensive to maintain 35 and can collapse under thermal stress. For instance, black abalone become more susceptible to rickettsia infection under variable temperatures and infected individuals die faster as mean temperature rises 36 . On the other hand, warmer temperatures can increase immune response in fishes and amphibians 37 , oak resistance to sudden oak death 38 , and the immune response to cold virus in humans 39 . Given these diverse responses, the immune response, like other performance measures, should follow a humpshaped temperature response curve with decreased function at lower or higher than optimal temperatures, though too few data exist to generalize 37 . Another way susceptibility can respond to climate change is if shifts in pathogen distributions expose na\u00efve host populations to new diseases 40 ; a key example is occurring in the Ethiopian highlands, where recent malaria expansions have caused increased disease in previously unexposed populations 41,42 . Overall, climate change could affect host susceptibility, but the effect probably varies with temperature and other factors.",

For example, an influenza virion's viability decreases with temperature so that flu transmission is lower during mild El Ni\u00f1o winters than in normal cold winters in California 43 . In contrast, transmission stage production in ectothermic hosts should increase with temperature up to a thermal optimum; for example, nematode parasites have increased in warming Arctic areas where larval development rates have increased 44, 45 . Increases in parasite and host death rates can counteract this temperature effect on parasite production. For instance, snails shed more amphibian-seeking trematode larvae under warmer temperatures 46 , and one might expect that parasite intensity would increase. However, trematode intensity is halved in a 3\u00b0C warming experiment because of an increase in parasite and host death rate 47 . This dual effect of production and death on transmission helps explain why some trematode infections increase with warmer water 48 , whereas other species do better at cold temperatures 49 . Likewise, although field observations initially suggested that swallow parasites would increase with global warming, experimentally heating nests above ambient temperature killed parasites, leading to a sharp decline in parasitism 50 . Similarly, increasing temperature hastens Plasmodium development but, above a certain temperature, transmission declines because of increased mosquito death, leading to hump-shaped temperature-transmission curves 51 .",

            "text": "Many factors drive disease transmission, including some that have changed in time along with climate. A key factor is host density (including vectors and reservoir hosts), which should increase the force of infection 64 . For instance, although marine disease reports have increased over time 65 , and some, like coral diseases, might be due to increased temperature, most disease reports parallel changes in host abundance (due to either increased disease transmission or increased detection). In particular, the one group for which disease reports declined over time was commercially valuable fishes, which have suffered global stock collapses 66 . For human, crop, and livestock diseases, economic development is another key driver 67, 68 . Most notably, it is clear from historical data that malaria does not occupy its full ecological niche, due to its elimination from wealthier nations 69 , leading to a decline in malaria's distribution as the earth has warmed 15,34 . Economic growth drives health interventions such as vector control, increased sanitation, deforestation, and shifts to urban living with limited wildlife contact, all of which can reduce disease emergence and spread 70 . However, economic growth also drives global travel and trade, which can unintentionally spread pathogens. Contact networks for directly transmitted diseases are now global due to air travel and trade routes that continue to introduce invasive species, which, on average, bring with them two parasitic species per host species 42 . These novel parasites meet na\u00efve hosts with unpredictable outcomes. Because host density and economics change over time, it can be hard to separate climate change effects from other changes. Current examples are emerging and resurging dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. These viruses benefitted from vector expansion and invasion, lapsed vector control, global tire trade, global human movement, urbanization and unplanned development, deforestation, high human densities, and poverty 71 . Despite these drivers, climate change captures the headlines, such as \"In Zika Epidemic, a Warning on Climate Change\" 72 .",

However, other drivers can correlate with temperature changes, making it difficult to separate a temperature effect from a spurious correlation. In particular, disease events during warm years are not sufficient evidence for a climate change effect because diseases emerge each year for various reasons. For instance, seven out of nine historical yellow fever epidemics occurred in different cities during the 1878-79 El Ni\u00f1o 74 , but this strong El Ni\u00f1o effect disappears after considering longer time series 34 . Because the recent Brazilian Zika epidemic occurred during an El Ni\u00f1o, similar claims have been made for Zika virus 75 even though Zika had previously spread throughout the South Pacific without fanfare 76 . Although increases in new human diseases and new locations for old diseases are alarming, some may be due to species introductions or increased surveillance and reporting but have no clear link to climate 2 . Sometimes a causal link between temperature and disease is not due to thermal physiology or climate change. In addition to direct physiological effects, temperature can indirectly affect disease dynamics. A temperature association can occur if warming drives changes in abundance or movement that affect transmission. For example, warming increases disease in monarch butterflies because a milder climate removes the need to migrate, which benefits protozoan parasites otherwise lost when infected hosts die during migration 77 . In other cases, a temperature effect is not a climate change effect. For example, deforestation creates warmer microclimates, which, in turn, can increase local malaria transmission 78 . Regardless, the difficulty in establishing a link between climate change and disease does not mean no link exists, just that observed links have alternative explanations that might be more or less likely. For these reasons, temperature-disease correlations best indicate a climate change effect if they persist after removing the temporal trend and have experimental support.",

Results can also be inconsistent among similar parasite species. For instance, a 30-year study found that one rabbit nematode species increased along with increases in temperatures but that a second did not change 80 . Similarly, while temperature increased at Finnish fish farms, two pathogens increased and two declined 81 .

Armed with better climate information, ecologists can use experiments, mathematical and statistical modeling, and observational work to understand and predict how infectious disease responds to climate change 82 . Basic information on thermal physiology is lacking, but various efforts are underway to better describe infectious agent and vector thermal niches by describing their thermal performance curves, testing for local adaptation, and measuring thermoregulation. Once we understand thermal physiology better, a greater appreciation for the economic and environmental factors driving infectious diseases will make it easier to evaluate climate change effects in relation to parallel changes such as land conversion, urbanization, species assemblages, host movement, and demography 83 . At that point, we can predict which diseases are most likely to emerge where, so that public health agencies can best direct limited disease control resources 84 , rather than wondering whether a warmer world will be a sicker world.",
