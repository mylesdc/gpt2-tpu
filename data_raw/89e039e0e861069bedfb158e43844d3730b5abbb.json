Patient clinical information was collected. Clinical pathology was assessed in subgroups defined based on clinical criteria, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) and SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) scores and discharge rate. Four functional SNPs, 21616T/C (rs2069705), 2764G/C (rs2069707), +874A/T (rs2430561) and +3234C/T (rs2069718), were genotyped by Snapshot in both sepsis patients and healthy controls. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the distribution of the SNPs, and the probability values (P values), odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.",

The mortality rate from sepsis is 10-20%, and the mortality rate from severe sepsis is 20-50% [1] ; these rates correspond to those reported in surveys of Chinese epidemics [3] . Because the disease is severely life threatening, the pathogenesis, prognostic factors and modes of therapy are of great interest to both clinicians and academic researchers. Recently, some studies showed that the individual genetic background is associated with the personal inflammatory response and also influences the pathology. Genes with related polymorphisms include the antigen recognition pathway protein [4, 5] , proteins associated with blood biochemistry [6] , pro- [7, 8] and antiinflammatory cytokines [9, 10] and others.",

Initially, IFN-c was presumed to only interfere with viral replication [12] , but subsequent experimental studies showed that it also protects the individual against bacterial [13, 14] and fungal pathogens [15] . The most important function of IFN-c is its macrophage-activating function, which up-regulates the expression of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) I [16, 17] and II [18, 19] , which are involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathways. IFN-c also mediates functions such as leukocyte attraction [16, 20] , maturation and differentiation, natural killer (NK) cell activity [21] and immunoglobulin (Ig) production and class switching in B cells [16] . In sepsis, IFN-c is an important regulator of infection and inflammation; it is released in small amounts during the initial period of infection, and the amount released increases during the inflammation period [22] [23] [24] . It is postulated that suppressing IFN-c to near normal levels during the early period of inflammation may benefit the host by preventing bacteria outflow [22] . Increased IFN-c levels during the later period [22] [23] [24] may be beneficial by stimulating the body's defense system [16] .",

The volunteers have agreed on a verbal consent that their peripheral blood will be used for harmless, non-profit purpose only and their personal information will be kept confidential upon the health examination; therefore, we didn't re-connect them for the written consent.

Patient scores on APACHE II and SOFA, which are two widely accepted evaluation systems [42] [43] [44] based on clinical indictors, were considered important indexes associated with sepsis development and outcome. We focused on patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and age-and sex-matched healthy controls, and pneumonia was regarded as a common precipitating factor of sepsis [45] . We collected patient information and grouped patients by clinical severity, APACHE II score and SOFA score to examine the genetic factors related to the incidence of sepsis and its clinical presentation. All the patients in our study presented with community acquired pneumonia, not acquired in a hospital or a nursing home residence. Many published papers have examined the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and sepsis. These studies focused on immune cell surface markers [4, 5] and cytokines [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , which are important for the immune system, and functional genetic polymorphisms. Our work sought to examine functional IFN-c polymorphisms in relation to pneumonia-induced sepsis.",

IFN-c is produced by most of the immune cells, including NK cells, T lymphocytes and macrophages [46, 47] , and is regulated by cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, which are secreted after the antigen is presented [48, 49] . While some experiments have shown that IFN-c is essential for the host immune response to pathogens [50, 51] , the investigation of IFN-c-deficient patients highlights the functions of IFN-c in stimulating the inflammatory response and regulating the immune system by demonstrating increased susceptibility to intracellular but not extracellular pathogens, with some decreased immunity as demonstrated by neutrophil mobilization and NK cell activation [52] . However, there are opposing opinions regarding the function of IFN-c in sepsis following studies in non-human models, including studies in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models in the rat. These reports stated that IFN-c could confer susceptibility and affect the outcome. There was evidence of a trend in the plasma level as well as evidence that antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-c improved the survival rate in an animal model [22] [23] [24] 53] , as IFN-c deficiency decreases the pathogen burden [53] .",

No mutation was detected in the 2764 position, and the frequencies of heterozygosity at 21616, +874 and +3234 were 0.48, 0.32 and 0.33, respectively, which differed from the frequencies in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data (21616, 0.499; 2764, 0.051; +874, 0.393; and +3234, 0.473).

The dominate mutation of 21616 and +874 (the addition analysis was the dominant model) were significant associated with the sepsis susceptibility. All the homozygosis mutation of 21616, +874 and +3234 were associated with protection against higher APACHE II and SOFA scores, while the 21616TT genotype was statistic sense in progression to severe sepsis either. As we expected, the haplotype results were consistent with the functional IFN-c research in sepsis. The CTT haplotype was associated with protection against sepsis initiation but marginal susceptibility to progression to severe sepsis(P = 0.054). The TAC haplotype.was associated with susceptibility to sepsis incidence and protection against progression to severe sepsis. There were three haplotypes for the 21616, +874 and +3234 SNPs. The TAC haplotype composed by three highexpression IFN-c alleles was the most frequent combination, while the CTT haplotype was the least frequent. Our results suggest that individuals with a genetic background associated with high IFN-c expression are more susceptible to sepsis, but once they have sepsis they are less likely to experience progression to severe sepsis. Individuals with low IFN-c expressions are less susceptible to sepsis, which is consistent with the results of the animal experiments.",

The population involved in our study settled in Guangzhou in the subtropical zone, which has a special environment including high temperature, high humidity and air pollution. While the patients in our study had pneumonia-induced sepsis, and some reports suggest that environmental conditions can significantly influence pneumonia [61, 62] , we expect our results to be less affected by environment factors because they are difficult to adjust for. As we expected, patients grouped by severity showed significant differences in age and APACHE II and SOFA scores, which corresponds to epidemiologic studies of sepsis, though the mortality from sepsis in our study was 40% compared to the reported rate of 10-20% [1, 3] . Due to this difference, we could conclude that the distribution of IFN-c SNPs in relation to sepsis outcome is only applicable to our region.",
