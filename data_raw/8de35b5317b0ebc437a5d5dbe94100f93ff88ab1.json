Metagenomics has been successfully used to characterise the strain of Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 that was responsible for a pan-European outbreak [4] and in a diagnostic context to identify rare neurological infections [5] and transplant-related infections [6] .

These solutions are likely to vary widely between health systems. Where genomics services need to be delivered to large geographically dispersed populations with devolved political and health infrastructures, such as in the USA, a distributed network approach might be the best solution. By contrast, when dealing with smaller populations in countries (such as England) where a strong, centralised nationwide disease surveillance mechanism is in place, building on this existing framework might be more effective. Despite these geographical variations in health-system organisation, some common principles exist, which we have identified through our analysis of pathogen genomics within the context of the English health system [8] . These common principles will need to be considered regardless of location.",

Providing genomics infrastructure and skills that are responsive to the diverse needs of clinicians and public-health practitioners is essential, yet not straightforward. Clinical diagnostic or time-sensitive investigations may require low-throughput, 'on demand' sequencing and automated analysison benchtop or even portable sequencersto deliver actionable results to clinicians. Portable sequencing kits have, for example, enabled 'lab in a suitcase' solutions to be deployed for real-time genomic surveillance of the Ebola virus in West Africa [3] . By contrast, larger scale, longitudinal public health surveillance activities could be delivered using approaches with higher throughput but longer turnaround times. An enormous variation also exists in access to genomic technology and expertise across health systems, as well as variation in the level of the underlying need for genomics as a tool to manage infectious disease. Those charged with management and commissioning of infectious disease services within individual health systems will, therefore, have to remain extremely flexible if they are to navigate this complex landscape of supply, demand and capability. It will be important to avoid over-investing in technology that could rapidly become obsolete and recognise that the optimal configuration and location of genomics services will vary according to local demand and the availability of genomics skills and infrastructure, which are also subject to rapid change.",

These have also been excellent examples of the effectiveness of collaborations, which were supported by openness and data sharing, that span multiple geographies, fields of expertise and professional groups. As we move towards implementing these advances across entire health systems, this collaborative spirit needs to be harnessed and scaled up to deliver more formalised networks for sharing knowledge and best practice. These networks will expedite national service deployment, accelerate future service development and provide expert forums in which the arduous but essential task of establishing the standards and benchmarks of service quality can be undertaken. High-level strategic coordination and knowledge-sharing across health delivery organisations are equally essential. For example, synergy in the development of pathogen genomics programmes across animal and human health sectors will be needed to deliver a 'one-health' approach to tackling many of the most pressing zoonotic disease threats, such as avian influenza and the spread of antimicrobial resistance from livestock to humans, as well as the more commonplace but persistent issue of foodborne illnesses.",

In the case of pathogen genomics for clinical or public health, data integration will require the construction of dedicated infrastructure (real or virtual) to collate, store, analyse and share genomic, epidemiological and clinical data across complex national and international health systems. This integration will be particularly crucial to enable the delivery of genomic epidemiology services, in which the requirement for data sharing across locations is fundamental and time (as in the 2015 Ebola outbreak) is very much of the essence. Data integration and access will become equally central in diagnostic microbiology, where having an accurate and readily accessible summary of genotype, phenotype and clinical information for different pathogens is essential to deliver care to patients.",

As an example, such barriers led the Indonesian government to temporarily withdraw from the Global Influenza Surveillance Network in 2007, owing to concerns that, if data were shared, proprietary interests would be exerted over the H5N1 strains [9] .

This situation is fluid, as sequencing technology (in the form of devices that are increasingly more portable, cost less and have a longer read capability) and analysis (in the form of cloud computing, more efficient metagenomic analysis and implementation of automated analytic pipelines) continue to develop apace. However, capitalising on the current rapid pace of innovation will demand novel approaches to public-private cooperation and co-development of the type seen with the Oxford Nanopore Minion Access Programme, which puts new genomic technology in the hands of its users (including those in the health system) at the earliest possible opportunity [10] . These efforts will also benefit from building on the commendably open and collaborative approaches for the development of knowledge and analytical methods that are already being taken by many pathogen genomics researchers.
