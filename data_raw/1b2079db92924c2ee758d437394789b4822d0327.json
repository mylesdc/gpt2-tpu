We examined whether the in-hospital mortality of patients in Taiwan treated with IABP has recently declined. We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to retrospectively review the in-hospital all-cause mortality of 9952 (7146 men [71.8%]) 18-year-old and older patients treated with IABP between 1998 and 2008. The mortality rate was 13.84% (n = 1377). The urbanization levels of the hospitals, and the number of days in the intensive care unit, of hospitalization, and of IABP treatment, and prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were associated with mortality. Seven thousand six hundred thirty-five patients (76.72%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, and 576 (5.79%) underwent high-risk PCI with IABP treatment. The number of patients treated with IABP significantly increased during this decade (p trend < 0.0001), the in-hospital all-cause mortality for patients treated with IABP significantly decreased (p trend = 0.0243), but the in-hospital all-cause mortality of patients who underwent CABG and PCI plus IABP did not decrease. In conclusion, the in-hospital mortality rate of IABP treatment decreased annually in Taiwan during the study period. However, high-risk patients who underwent coronary revascularization with IABP had a higher and unstable in-hospital mortality rate.",

It can increase myocardial and peripheral perfusion and reduce afterload and then improve cardiac output. It is also used in patients being weaned from a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A recent meta-analysis [1] reported that preoperative and 30-day mortality was significantly lower in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) plus perioperative IABP. IABP is sometimes used in ventricular arrhythmia and high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [2] . Using IABP in thrombolytic therapy increases the survival rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and CS [3, 4] . Thus, IABP is an intervention that might reduce perioperative mortality [5, 6] . However, the IABP-Shock II trial [7, 8] , in which outcomes were followed-up for~1 year, showed no reduction in 30-day mortality in patients with AMI and CS who also underwent early PCI. In the treatment guidelines for an ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) with CS, IABP was a IIB indication in Europe [9] and a IIA indication in the USA [10] .",

The details of the NHIRD have been described in hundreds of published papers [14] . In our 11-year (1998-2008) retrospective population-based study, inpatient expenditures for hospital admissions were examined to determine the in-hospital mortality of patients treated with IABP. We identified all hospitalized patients treated with IABP from the first two International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. ICD-9-CM codes were also used to identify patients treated with IABP who underwent PCI or CABG, and to identify patients treated with IABP who had baseline comorbidities of hypertension (HTN) (ICD-9-CM: 401-405), diabetes mellitus (DM) (ICD-9-CM: 250), hyperlipidemia (ICD-9-CM: 272), myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD-9-CM: 410), and cerebrovascular attack (CVA) (ICD-9-CM: 430-438). The comorbidities were selected based on the frequency of their appearance. Age, gender, urbanization level, hospital level, number of days in the intensive care unit (ICU), length of hospitalization, and duration of IABP treatment were also analyzed.",

However, the in-hospital mortality was higher for patients treated with coronary revascularization plus IABP, which was contrary to the overall trend in patients treated with IABP during this period. More men than women in our study had been treated with IABP, which is consistent with other studies [7, 11] . The in-hospital all-cause mortality for patients treated with IABP between 1998 and 2008 was 13.8%, significantly lower than the 20.1% in America and 28.7% in Europe between 1997 and 2002 [16] . Lower in-hospital mortality in our study might be attributable to improvements in the medical care given to patients in Taiwan, to the medications used, or to different conditions for using IABP during these years. We also found that shorter hospitalizations and longer durations of IABP use were associated with higher mortality. There were no hospital-level-based differences in the in-hospital mortality rates of patients treated with IABP in our study, which is consistent with a National Cardiovascular Data Registry study [17] . In the Benchmark Registry study [11] , women had a greater risk for major complications from IABP. Patients > 80 years old treated with IABP had the highest in-hospital mortality rate. The in-hospital mortality in patients < 35 years old treated with IABP was the second highest, but their 3-month mortality rate was the lowest of all age groups. This is probably because patients < 35 years old had fewer comorbid diseases.",

Most patients (n = 7635/9952, 76.7%) had been treated with IABP and CABG during the same admission; therefore, it was assumed that most patients required IABP to be weaned from a CPB, not to treat CS. Benchmark Registry data from 1996 to 2000 [11] showed that IABP was most often used to provide hemodynamic support during or after cardiac catheterization (20.6%). Our study showed that the in-hospital all-cause mortality rate of patients treated with CABG+IABP during the same hospitalization was 12.27% and that there was a similar mortality rate (12.6%) between 1996 and 2001 reported by Hemo et al. [21] and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (16.8%) in the Benchmark Registry of 1996-2000 [11] . In addition, this suggests a higher risk of in-hospital mortality when PCI is combined with IABP: our rate for these patients was 15.45%. Another recent large nationwide study [12] reported that the in-hospital mortality of patients in the USA treated with PCI plus IABP from 1998 to 2008 was 20.31%, with a decline to 17.8% in 2008. The early Benchmark Registry data [11] reported an in-hospital mortality rate of 18.4% for patients who underwent PCI combined with IABP.

Babaev et al. [25] reported that the 2004 in-hospital mortality rate of patients with AMI comorbid with CS, and listed in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), was 47.9%; for patients who underwent primary PCI, it was 33.9%; and for patients who underwent CABG, it was 16.7%. From the Benchmark Registry database [23] , the in-hospital mortality in patients with CS treated with IABP was 42.0%. We think there were two possible reasons for the lower mortality rate of patients with AMI and comorbid CS in our study. Firstly, emergency revascularization using PCI or CABG is done in Taiwan for most patients with STEMI and comorbid CS based on the current American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines [10] and on our customary daily practice. Of 550 patients with AMI and CS treated with IABP in our study, 453 (82.36%) had undergone CABG, 62 (11.27%) had undergone PCI, and only 35 (6.36%) had been treated only with medication. Therefore, most patients with AMI and comorbid CS treated with IABP underwent CABG, and our in-hospital mortality rate was 25.16%. Hemo et al. [21] reported that the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with CS undergoing CABG s/p IABP was 22.2%. Secondly, AMI comorbid with CS in our study was considered a major disease. We excluded 1390 patients because AMI with CS was not their major diagnosis, and because these patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate and they had other comorbidities.",

All the diagnoses were based on the ICD-9-CM codes, not patients' medical charts or personal observation by the authors. The NHIRD provides no detailed hemodynamic data, pathological data, or ratings of disease severity. The IABP-related complications, such as vascular and septic complications [26] , and the cause of death are not inferable from claims records. In addition, in the study we focus on AMI with CS as a major diagnosis based on the first two ICD-9-CM code discharge diagnoses. Some patients with AMI were not included in the study because CS was not one of their first two ICD-9-CM codes. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that unmeasured factors may have confounded the results. Second, because we could not obtain the patients' medical charts, we did not know precisely why each patient was treated with IABP. However, because we used the first two ICD-9-CM codes to detect each patient's main diseases, we are confident that they were the most likely reasons for IABP treatment.
