Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream effectors of Src, were accordingly decreased in Src-silenced or -inhibited TNBC cells. Additionally, TCGA data analysis indicated that Src expression levels in tumor tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was also significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients.",

Three markers aberrantly expressed in breast cancer are used for targeted therapy in clinics, including the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by tumors lacking ER, PgR, and Her2 expression, represents approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases (Collignon et al., 2016) . TNBC belongs to basal-like subtype of breast cancer and is associated with higher genetic instability, which does not have molecules for targeted therapy so far (Alcala-Corona et al., 2017) . Chemotherapy is the major treatment for patients with TNBC (Bianchini et al., 2016) . Though standard anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy can achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) for 30-40% of patients with early stage TNBC (von Minckwitz et al., 2012) , many patients with TNBC do not respond to chemotherapy and have relatively poor outcomes and prognosis (Bonotto et al., 2014) . Moreover, several groups currently investigate chemoresistant pathways in TNBC cells, suggesting chemoresistance is still a challenging problem in more advanced patients with TNBC (Loi et al., 2013; Wein and Loi, 2017) .",

For example, BCR-ABL plays a role in chronic myeloid leukemia, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung cancer, HER2 in breast cancer and the B-Raf mutation in melanoma (Ascierto et al., 2012) . Highly selective inhibitors for these kinases have also been developed for cancer treatment as targeted therapies (Knight et al., 2010) . Of note, there are approximately 538 kinase genes in the human genome (Cheng et al., 2014) . Only a few of the kinases have been well studied in various types of cancer. As such, little is known about the roles of most of the kinases in cancer malignancy and drug resistance, particularly in TNBC cells.",

Genetic or pharmacological ablation of the Src kinase diminished the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, AKT and STAT3, and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Co-expression of high levels of Src and STAT3 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC, suggesting that combination therapy with Src inhibitor and chemotherapeutic drugs might be beneficial for Src-expressing patients with TNBC.",

Src-silenced cells had significantly increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3B) . Moreover, clonogenic assay results showed that the number of colonies was decreased in doxorubicin-treated, Src-silenced cells. A combination of siRNA against Src and doxorubicin treatment completely abrogated colony formation in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figures 3C,D) . To avoid side effects of transient transfection, we generated Src stable knockdown cells with shRNA against Src in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 4) . Similar to the effects of siRNA on cell viability and colony forming ability, stably Src-silenced TNBC cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin treatments than control cells (Figures 4B-D) . Further, MDA-MB-468, another Src highly expressed and activated TNBC cell line, was even more resistant to doxorubicin (Figure 4E) , suggesting Src might be associated with chemoresistance in TNBC cells.",

The Src kinase can lead to drug resistance in cancer cells during targeted therapy through the activation of several downstream effectors, particularly of AKT and STAT3 (Zhang and Yu, 2012) . In addition, recent studies indicate that Src triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of BH3 only protein Bik through the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway to attenuate apoptosis in cells under stress (Lopez et al., 2012; Ballesta et al., 2013) . To identify any potential molecules involved in Figure 5A) . Likewise, similar results were seen for AKT and STAT3 at the protein level in Src-silenced Hs578T cells ( Figure 5B) . Nevertheless, Bik protein levels were unexpectedly decreased in Src knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells, while it was slightly increased in Hs578T cells ( Figure 5 ). In addition, dasatinib, a selective Src family kinase inhibitor, attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figures 5C,D) . Dasatinib further inhibited cell viability and enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 5E ). Ectopically expression of STAT3 constitutive active form (CA) was more resistant to doxorubicin than dominant negative form (DN) in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5F ), suggesting that Src-STAT3 signaling may confer to resistance of doxorubicin in TNBC cells.",

            "text": "There is no specific biomarker or target for TNBC during chemotherapy thus far, which leads to poor outcomes for patients with TNBC. Kinases are involved in many biological processes that are associated with catabolic homeostasis and diseases. Several kinases have been identified as oncogenes that promote tumorigenesis and resistance of radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting these oncogenic kinases with either monoclonal antibodies or small molecular inhibitors provides promising antitumor effects. However, little is known about the role of kinases on drug resistance in TNBC cells. Herein, we screened kinome siRNA library for chemoresistant kinase in TNBC cells and report the following findings: first, Src kinase is the most resistant kinase in TNBC cells in response to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Second, ablation of Src reduced phosphorylation AKT and STAT3 in TNBC cells. Src and STAT3 highly activated TNBC cells were also more resistant to doxorubicin. Third, Src expression was higher in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression of Src and STAT3 was further associated with poor prognosis, suggesting Src-STAT3 axis might be involved in chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Genome-wide screening with a siRNA library has been employed to identify many novel regulators associated with diseases, such as the polo-like kinase 1 for cancer (Hu et al., 2009) , \u03b22 subunit of the coatomer protein complex for virus infection (de Wilde et al., 2015) and the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A for neurodegenerative diseases (Azorsa et al., 2010) . Although the screening system provides a powerful tool for biomedical research, it may have been biased by the primary and validation assays. We used the MDA-MB-231 cells in our primary assay and validated the potential genes in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TNBC cells. Several genes appeared to be involved in the chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 cells, but these genes did not exert any effects in Hs578T TNBC cells, such as the serine/threonineprotein kinase NIM1, C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1). These kinases may be overexpressed or activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in Hs578T cells. ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that contains an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal kinase domain (Acquaviva et al., 2009) . Gene rearrangement of the 3 UTR region of ROS1 with many different genes occurs in several cancer cells and activates downstream effectors to promote tumorigenesis, including ERK, AKT, and STS3 (Davies and Doebele, 2013) . These results suggest that ROS1 activation may be involved in doxorubicin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells but not Hs578T cells. Further study is required to examine the differential roles of ROS1 in these TNBC cells. Moreover, dasatinib suppresses chemoresistance in chondrosarcoma cells, particularly in cells with TP53 mutations (van Oosterwijk et al., 2013) . Our current study also showed that Src-silenced breast cancer cells with a TP53 mutation, such as MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and T47D cells, were relatively more sensitive to doxorubicin than that in MCF-7 cells, which have wild-type TP53. More importantly, most of patients with TNBC have TP53 mutation (\u223c75%) (Liu et al., 2018) . Though TP53 mutation may be involved in the resistant mechanisms for DNA damaged drugs, several mechanisms might also confer to chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Thus, investigating chemoresistant targets in TNBC cells with TP53 mutation would be able to reflect the situation in clinical settings. However, the role of TP53 in Src-modulated chemoresistance in breast cancer cells requires more work to be verified. Src tyrosine kinases are overexpressed in TNBC and promote receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, which affects cell adhesion and migration (Hochgrafe et al., 2010) . The Src protein level is higher in tumor tissues of patients with TNBC than in patients with non-TNBC (Tryfonopoulos et al., 2011) . Combination treatment with dasatinib and cisplatin has synergistic effects on cancer suppression in TNBC cells (Tryfonopoulos et al., 2011) , supporting our notion that Src might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC cells. Nevertheless, the results of TCGA data analysis showed that Src mRNA level is not statistically correlated with overall and diseasefree survival in patients with TNBC. The phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416, which activates Src, is associated with poor diseasefree survival in patients with colorectal cancer and cervical cancer (Hou et al., 2013; Kopetz et al., 2014) . These results raise a possibility that Src activation may be a more precise way to determine its correlation with disease in TNBC patients, but further study is required to verify this idea.",

Silencing Src reduces expression of Aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1), a cancer stemness marker, and sphere formation in lung cancer cells (Lee et al., 2018) . Besides, Src can phosphorylate caspase-8 at tyrosin 397 to suppress apoptosis (Tsang et al., 2016) . Src may also inhibit apoptosis via directly phosphorylation at tyrosin 530 of Ku-70, which is a crucial protein to repair DNA double-strand breaks (Morii et al., 2017) . These results suggest Src could activate several pathways to cause chemoresistance in cancer cells.",

Dasatinib has been shown to inhibit the growth of TNBC cell lines in vitro when used in combination with standard chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, or when used as a single agent (Finn et al., 2007) . The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in TNBC and inhibitors against this pathway are being developed in preclinical or early phase clinical trials (Massihnia et al., 2016) . Rapamycin and its analogs temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus, inhibitors of mTOR, are undergoing clinical evaluation for treatment of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer (Minami et al., 2011) , supporting our notion that Src-AKT-STAT3 signaling may be crucial for chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Besides Src-STAT3 in chemoresistance of TNBC, several mechanisms might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC as reported previously, including (i) ABC transporters efflux, (ii) NF\u03baB pathway, (iii) increase of anti-apoptosis and detoxification proteins (O'Reilly et al., 2015) and (iv) gene amplification of proto-oncogenes, such as MYC and JAK2 (Wein and Loi, 2017) . However, the crosstalk among the pathways and effects of the other pathways on Src-mediated chemoresistance in cell culture model and clinical relevance would need further studies to verify.",

Although dasatinib is more effective for cancer cells with aberrant Src activation (Zhang and Yu, 2012) , no Src inhibitors successfully suppresses tumors in cancer patients when used alone, possibly because there is no suitable biomarker to monitor Src activation in tumor tissues or because the treatment triggers alternative routes for resistance to Src inhibition (Zhang and Yu, 2012) .
