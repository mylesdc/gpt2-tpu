The total population of children aged 14 years or younger is estimated to be 230 million. Although the epidemiology of RSV infections has been studied in cities such as Beijing, Chongqing and Lanzhou [8] [9] [10] , few RSV studies in China have been published in English.

This is consistent with the previous reports of RSV in both developed and developing countries [7, 12, 15, 16] . The data show that RSV accounted for nearly 30% of all ARTIs in infants. Efforts to prevent RSV infections in infants can lead to a substantial reduction of RSV associated morbidity, mortality and medical costs in China.

In areas where temperatures remain colder throughout the year, RSV activity also occurs almost continuously [17, 18] . Most areas of China have a temperate climate. We found that the peak of RSV activity mainly occurred during winter and spring in China, which is similar to the previous reports [19] [20] [21] .
