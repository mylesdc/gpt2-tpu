The aim of this study was to map research productivity on the disease based on the articles indexed in PubMed. The articles related to MERS dated from 2012 to 2015 were retrieved from PubMed. The articles were classified into three categories according to their focus. Publication outputs were assessed and frequently used terms were mapped using the VOS viewer software. A total of 443 articles were included for analysis. They were published in 162 journals, with Journal of Virology being the most productive (44 articles; 9.9%) and by six types of organizations, with universities being the most productive (276 articles; 62.4%).The largest proportion of the articles focused on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (47.2%) and those on prevention and control ranked third (26.2%), with those on other focuses coming in between (26.6%). The articles on prevention and control had the highest mean rank for impact factor (IF) (226.34), followed by those on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (180.23) and those on other focuses (168.03). The mean rank differences were statistically significant (p = 0.000). Besides, \"conronavirus\", \"case\", \"transmission\" and \"detection\" were found to be the most frequently used terms. The findings of this first bibliometric study on MERS suggest that the prevention and control of the disease has become a big concern and related research should be strengthened.",

Screening through titles and abstracts excluded 481 articles (335 unrelated to MERS, 29 news, two books and 333 non-research papers). Therefore, 443 articles were included for analysis ( Figure 1 ). The retrieved articles were from 40 countries, of which USA ranked first, followed by China and Saudi Arabia in that order ( Table 3 ). The articles published in these three countries far outnumbered the others. Saudi Arabia is the country where MERS originated and that was most seriously stricken by the disease [1]. Fifteen countries, including Austria, Belgium and India, published only one article. The organizations were classified into six categories, specifically government department, research organization, university, hospital, centers for disease control and prevention, and others (company, blood center, Red Cross, etc.). More than half (62.4%) of the research output came from universities, followed by research organizations (10%), others (9.5%), hospitals (8.5%), government departments (6.3%) and CDCs (3.2%). The three most productive organizations were the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, the University of Hong Kong in China, and the University of Bonn in Germany (Table 4 ). (Table 5 ) [11] . The other most productive corresponding authors are from Germany, USA, Netherlands, France and China. Ranking of the research categories was prevention and control study (26.2%), basic medical sciences and clinical studies (47.2%), and other studies (26.6%) ( Table 6 ). The differences between the three categories in the three years were statistically significant (X 2 = 23.849, p = 0.000) ( Table 6 ). Of all the 443 articles, 378 were published in SCI journals, with a minimum IF of 0.24, maximum of 55.87 and median of 4.43, and an interquartile range between 2.85 and 6.75 (Table 7 ). The mean ranks of the three categories were found to be prevention and control studies (226.34), basic medical sciences and clinical studies (180.23), and others (168.03). Differences in mean ranks of IF between the three types were statistically significant (Kruskal Wallis Test X 2 = 16.031, p = 0.000). A total of 116 articles were identified as covering prevention and control and 99 were SCI articles with IF. The domains of the 99 SCI articles with IF were transmission and risk factors, investigation and surveillance, intervention and others ( Table 8 ). The minimum IF was 0.59, the maximum 55.87, and the median 5.99, with an interquartile range between 3.01 and 8.88. The mean rank of IF of transmission and risk factors was 46.99, of investigation and surveillance 48.26, of intervention 53.33, and of others 56.32. The differences in the IF mean ranks between the four types were not statistically significant (X 2 = 1.936, p = 0.586). A map was created with VOSviewer, showing the density of the frequently used terms in MERS-related articles (Figure 2 ). Colored regions represent research areas. The font size and bubble size of a term reflect its frequency of use [7] . For example, the term \"coronavirus\" was more frequently used than the term \"risk\" because the former is in larger font than the latter. The most frequently used terms were \"coronavirus\", \"case\", \"transmission\" and \"detection\". It is noticeable that less frequent terms, for example \"vaccine\", had inconspicuous views.

The results could also be biased by not exploring databases in other languages, for example Arabic, the official language of Saudi Arabia, where the most cases of MERS were reported. Second, due to the study design and time restriction, the latest articles published after August 2015 have not yet been considered in this study and this may bias the results. Third, the search terms may have missed early articles without the acronym MERS when the virus had not yet been named. However, since there are very few of those articles and most of them are descriptive studies, results could be slightly biased. Fourth, with current methodology, each article carries a single first-corresponding author, but a lot of papers involve cooperation between countries. This may underestimate the number of the articles for some countries. Fifth, the category of basic medical sciences and clinical studies can be further divided up into at least two groups, and this can bias the results to some extent.",
