PDCoV-infected suckling piglets were characterized with thin and transparent intestinal walls from colon to caecum, spot hemorrhage at mesentery and intestinal bleeding. PDCoV RNA was detected in multiple organs and tissues by Taqman real-time RT-PCR, which had high copies in ileum, inguinal lymph node, rectum and spleen. PDCoV antigen was detected in the basal layer of jejunum and ileum by IHC. In this research, we found that PDCoV could infect various ages of farmed pigs with watery diarrhea and anorexia in different seasons in a year.",

Since then, the detection of PDCoV was reported subsequently in many countries, such as South Korea, Canada, China, Vietnam and Japan [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . PDCoV could cause acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and even lead to death in nursing piglets, with the main lesion of villous atrophy in intestines [10] [11] [12] [13] . The prevalence of PDCoV in Henan province of China was about 23.49%, and up to 36.43% in suckling piglets [14, 15] . Infected sows usually did not show obviously clinical signs so that the PDCoV detection in sows was often ignored.",

The co-infection of PDCoV with these viruses is common in clinic. However, PEDV could cause severe diarrhea and high mortality (up to 100%) in piglets worldwide [17] . The prevalence of PEDV infection was higher in cold season, especially in January and February, compared with that in warm seasons [18, 19] . With TGEV infection, the mortality rate of neonatal piglets comes up to 100%, especially in piglets no more than 2 weeks of age [20, 21] . SADS-CoV mainly infected newborn pigs which are less than 5 days of age, and the mortality rate was 90% [16] .",

In this research, PDCoV viral RNA was also detected in intestines, heart, spleen, lung, kidney and many other organs by Taqman real-time RT-PCR [30, 31] . This result showed that there was the similarity in viral distribution in the tissues and organs between field and experimental PDCoV-infected pigs. The number of viral RNA copy in intestinal tract was higher than that in other tissues. It is known that PDCoV antigen captured mainly in villous enterocytes of the small and large intestines [30, 31] , but we detected some PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the intestinal crypts, which had the same result with Jung's report [32] .",

PDCoV was first reported in early February of 2014 in the United States, in March of 2014 in Canada, in April of 2014 in Korea [4] [5] [6] . It seemed that like PEDV and TGEV [21, 22] , disease caused by PDCoV infection mainly peaks in colder months between January and April. However, in the present study, one swine farm outbroke PDCoV in June, which is a very hot month in Henan Province of China, indicating that we need to continue monitoring the prevalence of PDCoV in all the seasons.",
