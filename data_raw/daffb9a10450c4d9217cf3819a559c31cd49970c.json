Epitope enhancement can elicit more potent T cell responses and can subsequently lead to a stronger memory pool; however, the molecular basis of such enhancement is unclear. We used the consensus peptide-binding motif for the Major Histocompatibility Complex molecule H-2K b to design a heteroclitic version of the mouse hepatitis virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant. We demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution at a secondary anchor residue (Q to Y at position 3) increased the stability of the engineered determinant in complex with H-2K b . The structural basis for this enhanced stability was associated with local alterations in the pMHC conformation as a result of the Q to Y substitution. Recombinant viruses encoding this engineered determinant primed CTL responses that also reacted to the wildtype epitope with significantly higher functional avidity, and protected against selection of virus mutated at a second CTL determinant and consequent disease progression in persistently infected mice. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of an engineered determinant that will serve as a template for guiding the development of heteroclitic T cell determinants with applications in prevention of CTL escape in chronic viral infections as well as in tumor immunity.",

            "text": "Despite the antigenic complexity of microbes, primary pathogen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are commonly directed to just one or a few determinants. Furthermore, even when multiple epitopes are targeted, distinct patterns of epitope hierarchy often emerge. Such immunodominant epitopes commonly elicit high-magnitude CTL responses characterized by potent cytolytic function, whereas subdominant determinants generate responses that are relatively lower in magnitude and often less efficacious. In general, potent anti-viral CTL strongly correlate with control of infection and less clinical disease. Viral progeny selected on the basis of CTL surveillance can evolve to evade T cell responses. This selective pressure results in mutations in immunodominant CTL determinants that abrogate recognition. CTL escape virus is commonly observed in humans and nonhuman primates infected with HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its selection often correlates with disease progression [1] [2] [3] [4] . Escape mutations may diminish binding to the restricting MHC class I molecule, interfere with T cell receptor (TcR) recognition or interfere with antigen processing [5] [6] [7] . Escape mutations are usually detected in epitopes targeted by CTL that exhibit high functional avidity because the corresponding potent CTL response exerts high selective pressure on the virus [2] . In some HIVinfected patients, CTL escape occurs without an associated enhancement of virus replication, suggesting that the mutations compromised virus fitness or, alternatively, the variant determinant elicited a de novo CTL response [8, 9] . Virus fitness is sometimes restored, with concomitant increased virus replication, when a second, compensatory mutation is selected [10, 11] . Collectively these results suggest that given the importance of virus diversification (CTL escape) in disease progression, suppression of selection or outgrowth of CTL escape variants should improve outcomes in persistently infected animals and humans.",

Enhancement strategies, which result in augmented responses to the native, subdominant epitope, have been described for both MHC class I and class II-restricted determinants, whereby the most common approaches involve generating a series of conserved and non-conserved mutations at MHC anchor residues, followed by an empiric determination of whether each individual substitution augments T cell effector function [12] . Furthermore, evaluating the effect of epitope enhancement in vivo has generally been achieved via heterologous infection systems [13] [14] [15] . Thus, while these results demonstrate proof of principle, direct evidence for enhanced protection against autologous microbial infection in vivo is lacking. The design of heteroclitic determinants in which non-MHC anchor residues are targeted for substitution are also usually determined empirically. Studies of heteroclitic tumor epitopes have demonstrated the clinical utility of such determinants [16, 17] . Notably, however, there are no well defined examples of viral epitopes which demonstrate enhanced immunity and the molecular basis for the enhanced immunogenicity is not well understood.",

            "text": "Potential interventions to directly manipulate host-pathogen interactions and thereby diminish CTL escape variant selection are often difficult to evaluate since most examples of CTL escape occur in infected humans or non-human primates. By contrast, mice persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV) serve as a useful system for investigating anti-viral CTL responses and CTL escape [18] [19] [20] . Two JHMV-derived CTL epitopes are recognized in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The immunodominant H-2D b -restricted CTL epitope (S510, CSLWNGPHL, spanning residues 510-518 of the Spike (S) glycoprotein) elicits a highmagnitude, high-avidity CTL response that drives virus diversification during persistent infection [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . A second subdominant CTL epitope, S598 (H-2K b -restricted, RCQIFANI, spanning residues 598-605 of the S glycoprotein) also elicits an appreciable CTL response [21] ; however, S598-specific CTL exhibit ,100-fold lower functional avidity and do not protect from CTL escape in S510. The presence of a readily mutable dominant and a subdominant epitope with high and low functional avidity, respectively, in JHMV-infected mice is useful for investigating both epitope enhancement and approaches to diminishing CTL escape. Consistent with this notion, we have previously shown that the introduction of a second dominant CD8 T cell epitope into the JHMV genome (GP33 from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)) protected mice from the development of CTL escape in S510 and enhanced virus clearance [22] .",

Importantly, Gln-3 diverges from the consensus H-2K b -restricted ligand binding motif, in which a tyrosine is often present at position 3 [24, 25] . Therefore, we substituted a glutamine residue for tyrosine (Q600Y, CAA to TAT, RCYIFANI) at position 3 of the determinant with the aim of creating a peptide that bound more tightly to H-2K b . Stability of the H-2K b /S598 and H-2K b /S598 Q600Y complexes was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). As shown in Figure 1 , H-2K b /S598 Q600Y was considerably more thermostable than the native complex (Tm 54uC vs 64uC). To probe the biological properties of the Q600Y substitution, we used reverse genetics to engineer a recombinant version of JHMV expressing the S598 Q600Y epitope (Figure 2A) . Recombinant viruses encoding this substitution replicated as efficiently as wild type JHMV (rJ) in vitro during one-step growth kinetics analyses and in vivo virus competition assays ( Figure 2B , C). The immunogenicity of S598 Q600Y was assessed by intracellular expression of IFN-c by central nervous system (CNS)-derived lymphocytes. Since Cys-containing peptides are often diminished in",

Here, we describe the development of an engineered CD8+ T cell epitope that elicits an immune response to the native epitope that is more potent than the one that occurs during the natural infection. We showed that this ''improved'' (heteroclitic) epitope protects against clinical disease and against cytotoxic T cell escape that frequently occurs in the immunodominant epitope expressed by the virus. We also performed structural analyses and showed that enhanced immunogenicity was associated with changes in the conformations of both the peptide and the region of the MHC class I molecule that is in close association with the peptide. These studies provide a model for designing T cell epitopes with enhanced immunogenicity that will be useful in vaccine development, with particular emphasis on diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C, in which epitope mutation and escape is common. Seven days p.i., total RNA was harvested from the brains of mice and relative representation of virus template was determined via RT-PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products. The relative proportion of animals in which only rJ, only rJ.S Q600Y , or a mixture of the two viruses is shown.

TCEP enhanced the stimulatory capacity of the S598 peptides ( Figure  S1B ), indicating that a proportion of the unmodified S598 peptide stock had undergone oxidation. Thus, we stimulated CNS-and spleen-derived CTL ex vivo in the presence of 500 mM TCEP, a concentration consistent with other work with Cys containing peptides [23, 26] .",

S598 Q600Y -primed cross-reacting cells exhibited 7-fold higher functional avidity, relative to those primed by the native determinant ( Figure 3C , D) and are therefore distinct from CTL primed by the native S598 determinant. Consistent with the presence of a distinct population of cells, there were modest differences in Vb chain utilization when total populations from rJ and rJ.S Q600Y -infected mice and when total and cross-reacting cell populations from rJ.S Q600Y -infected mice ( Figure S2 ) were compared. In all instances, Vb5.1/5.2 expression was relatively over-represented, but some Vb elements were preferentially utilized by specific responding populations (Vb11, Vb13 and Vb14). Also consistent with this observation, alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two determinants revealed that the CTL response to each cognate peptide following infection was also subtly different reflecting the altered repertoire. The CTL response to each cognate peptide was very sensitive to mutation at every position except 2 and 9 although mutations in the S598 Q600Y determinant were tolerated slightly better than changes in the S598 epitope ( Figure S2C -E).",

Diversification at S510 is observed in pups infected with neurovirulent JHMV at 10 days of age and nursed by JHMV-immune dams [27] . These mice are largely protected from developing acute lethal encephalitis, but a variable percentage (30-90%) later develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Infectious virus isolated from these mice with late onset clinical disease is mutated in S510, resulting in enhanced virus replication [20] , with demyelination occurring during the process of virus clearance [28] . Thus, we next infected maternal antibody-protected suckling mice with rJ or rJ.S Q600Y viruses and monitored persistently infected mice for the development of clinical signs for 60 days post infection (p.i.). The presence of the highly immunogenic S598 Q600Y epitope did not protect mice from acute encephalitis ( Figure 3E ), perhaps because the presence of the improved S598 epitope was accompanied by a diminished response to S510 ( Figure 2D ). However, we found that among survivors (defined as survival past day 14 p.i.) there was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical disease as well as in the development of CTL escape in S510 (Table 1) . Additionally, S598 Q600Y did not undergo CTL escape in mice persistently infected with rJ.S Q600Y , even though single nucleotide changes in the region of the S glycoprotein gene encoding the S598 determinant could potentially result in fifty-one CTL escape mutations. Thus, as expected, the ''improved'' S598 Q600Y epitope was protective in vivo in infected mice, likely because S598 Q600Yspecific CTL are present in higher numbers and exhibit higher functional avidity than the native S598-specific response.",

The CTL response is predicted to be largely directed at S598 Q600Y in mice infected with this virus. The W513R mutation (position 4 substitution in S510 epitope, CSLRNGPHL) occurs in 13% of all CTL escape variants [19, 20, 22, 29, 30] , and completely abrogates native S510 CTL recognition [31] . We verified that virusspecific CTL responses were focused on S598 Q600Y in adult B6 mice infected with rJ.S W513R+Q600Y ( Figure 3F ). To examine the phenotype of the S598 Q600Y /S510 W513R double mutant, we infected antibody-protected suckling B6 mice with this virus and appropriate controls and monitored mice for survival ( Figure 3G ). As expected, 93.3% of mice infected with rJ survived the acute infection (day 0-14 p.i.). All mice infected with rJ.S W513R developed fatal encephalitis but, in marked contrast, 66.6% of mice infected with rJ.S W513R+Q600Y survived. We also found that survival correlated with virus clearance ( Figure 3H ). Relative to rJ-infected mice, replication was suppressed in mice infected with virus encoding the S598 Q600Y epitope and greatly elevated in mice infected with rJ.S W513R . In mice infected with rJ.S W513R+Q600Y , virus titers were intermediate between rJ and rJ.S W513R . Thus, the presence of the heteroclitic S598 Q600Y determinant contributed to suppression of virus replication and to increased survival, even when the highmagnitude, high-avidity CTL response to S510 was largely abrogated.",

In other experiments, we examined the survival of mice vaccinated with each determinant, but we observed no significant differences between groups (data not shown), probably because mortality is largely CD4 T cell-mediated in adult mice with acute encephalitis [33, 34] . In terms of virus titers, vaccination with either the native or enhanced S598 determinants resulted in ,70-80% reduction in virus burden compared to mice that received un-pulsed BMDC ( Figure 4B ).

The structure of H-2K b /S598 consists of two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. of 0.18 \u00c5 for Ca atoms), with the S598 peptide clearly bound in the antigen binding cleft of the heavy chains (HC, Figure S3A ). The two peptide copies display a virtually identical configuration with root mean square deviation (rmsd) values of only 0.09 \u00c5 for all peptide atoms (0.05 \u00c5 for Ca atoms). The mode of S598 and S598 Q600Y binding within the Agbinding cleft is unambiguous, with the exception of Arg-1, whose side chain is partially disordered (Figure 5A,D; Figure S3C ). The S598 peptide adopts an extended conformation, with the side chains of Arg-1, Ile-4 and Asn-7 extending prominently out of the cleft ( Figure 5C ). Ala-6 is also largely solvent exposed with its side chain pointing towards the a2 helix, while the side chains of Cys (Aba)-2, Gln-3, Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried within the cleft. While the cysteine analogue's side chain is not involved in any hydrophilic interactions, there are a number of suitably positioned hydrogen bonding partners (Glu-24, Tyr-45 and Asn-70), with which the original thiol side chain could potentially interact ( Figure S3B ; Table S2 ).",

This increase in complementarity of the MHC for S598 Q600Y and the greater stability of the resulting complex were predicted from comparisons of the WT determinant complex with existing structures of H-2K b bound with peptides similar to S598 and possessing the consensus tyrosine anchor residue at position 3, as well as another aromatic residue at position 5.",

Changes in the side chain conformations of Ser-99 and Gln-114 in the Q600Y complex structure are consistent with the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions with position 3. In the wild type peptide structure, Glu-152 forms a salt bridge with Arg-155, the guanadinium group of which also forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl group of the peptide's Ile-4. While these interactions are maintained in the Q600Y complex, the side chain of Glu-152 displays a conformational shift consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond with the peptide's Tyr-3 ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly the region of the a-2 helix around Glu-152 (Gly-151 -Glu-154) also displays significant main chain and side chain deviations between the two structures (rmsd of 0.77 \u00c5 for Ca atoms; Figure 6 ). Thus, consistent with the functional analyses, the structure of the heteroclitic variant of the S598 epitope displays relatively small changes in conformation yet the combination of these subtle changes in the TcR accessible residues and the structural landscape of the MHCp in addition to the enhanced stability of the complex lead to more efficacious CTL responses.",

            "text": "We describe the identification of a heteroclitic determinant that enhances recognition by virus-specific CD8 T cells, and use the crystal structure of the new determinant (S598 Q600Y ) to provide a basis why it elicits an enhanced CTL response. Comparison of S598 to the consensus binding motif suggested a suboptimal interaction with the H-2K b molecule at the secondary anchor position (Gln-3) and, consequently, an approach to enhance the immunogenicity of the determinant. Replacement of the Gln-3 with Tyr-3 (Q600Y) did, indeed, result in an determinant with increased thermostability without diminishing the CD8 T cell response. Most strikingly, the Q600Y change resulted in subtle changes in the conformation of the a-2 helix locally in the vicinity of Glu-152. These subtle changes are likely critical for the enhanced TcR recognition that we detected. S598 Q600Y elicited a response with higher functional avidity to both the cognate and native determinants than S598, and this was not reflected in differential Vb usage. The T cell response to S598 in rJ-infected mice is very diverse [35] . As assessed by Vb usage, the response to S598 and S598 Q600Y in rJ.S598 Q600Y was similarly diverse with only modest differences noted when cells from mice primed by S598 and S598 Q600Y were compared. While we cannot exclude the possibility that cross-reacting S598-specific cells primed by S598 Q600Y are biased for Vb chains not analyzed in this study, it is more likely that the fine specificity of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) determines their greater affinity for H-2K b /S598. Although an increase in stability of the MHC class I/peptide complex is not generally expected to enhance TcR affinity for the complex, similar results have been observed in mice immunized with analogues to a common tumor antigen [36] .",

Previous studies showed that this determinant exhibited low functional avidity [21] , but it was not known whether this reflected low binding to the MHC class I or to the TcR. Assuming that low affinity for MHC class I results in a low effective concentration of H-2K b /S598 complex on the cell surface, the responding T cells should be high avidity, based, primarily, on in vitro studies [37] . While the relationship between level of surface peptide and avidity of the responding T cells generated in vivo is not as clearcut [38] , there is no obvious explanation for how a peptide with low MHC class I binding also elicits a low avidity T cell response. This selection of only a subset of CD8 T cells capable of responding to S598 may partly explain why S598-primed cells do not recognize the Q600Y determinant.",

This was important to demonstrate because other studies, using tumor models, have shown that immunogenicity and tumor recognition are not necessarily concordant [39] . Mutations resulting in CTL escape occur most commonly in determinants that are exposed to high selective pressure [40] [41] [42] and outgrowth of CTL escape variants is efficiently suppressed by effective and rapid virus clearance [43] [44] [45] [46] , as occurs in mice infected with rJ.S Q600Y . Thus, even though CTL escape is not detected in normal mice infected with LCMV or influenza, escape does occur when mice transgenic for a single LCMV-specific TcR are infected with high amounts of virus [44, 47] . Under these conditions, the immune response is highly focused on a single CD8 T cell determinant and virus replication continues for extended periods of time, facilitating mutation at the targeted determinant.",

Mutations in S598 Q600Y were not detected even when the CTL response was directed primarily at this determinant (e.g. mice infected with rJ.S W513R + Q600Y ). Consistent with this inability to readily tolerate mutations, we were unable to generate recombinant virus mutated in position Ile-4 (I601D,E,K,R,T) and recombinant virus mutated at Phe-5 (F602A) was highly attenuated (data not shown). The combination of induction of high avidity CTL and inability to tolerate mutation without adversely affecting virus fitness make S598 Q600Y an ideal target for the anti-JHMV CTL response. Further, the ala scanning results suggest that S598 Q600Y -specific CTLs may more readily tolerate changes in the H-2K b /peptide complex, and this plasticity would also minimize the likelihood of CTL escape. In contrast, we have previously shown that introduction of the LCMV-specific GP33 determinant, which also elicits CTL with high functional avidity, into JHMV greatly diminished clinical disease but did not prevent CTL escape [22] . The GP33 determinant was introduced at a site in the genome that tolerated mutation and deletion and intact determinant was no longer present in virus by day 20 p.i. Collectively these results suggest that a response to a second determinant that elicits CTL exhibiting high functional avidity at early times p.i. results in enhanced suppression of virus replication, but its presence throughout the infection is required to protect against CTL escape.",

In our mouse system, immunization with the heteroclitic determinant resulted in the generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to an otherwise modestly immunogenic viral epitope. The generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to weakly immunogenic epitopes will be useful for the treatment and prevention of human infectious diseases. Our proposed structure-guided approach has direct application to HIV, HCV and other chronic infections in which virus persistence and CTL escape occurs. By modulating T cell immunity through prophylactic or therapeutic peptide-based vaccination, virus titers may be reduced and CTL escape and other consequences of viral persistence circumvented.",

(A) Total mononuclear cells were harvested from mice infected with rJ or rJ.S Q600Y and stimulated ex vivo with S598 and S598 Q600Y peptides, respectively. Following stimulation, aliquots of cells were surface stained for CD8 and the indicated Vb chain followed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-c. (B) CNSderived cells from rJ.S Q600Y -infected mice were stimulated ex vivo with peptides corresponding to native S598 or S598 Q600Y epitopes. Following stimulation, cells were analyzed as described for (A). Data represent the fraction of IFN-c+CD8+ T cells expressing each Vb chain and are derived from cells pooled from 2-3 individual mice. (C) Alanine scanning of the native S598 determinant. CNS-derived mononuclear cells were recovered from rJ-infected mice 7 days p.i. and stimulated ex vivo in the presence of 500 mM TCEP and 1 mM of the indicated peptide then stained for CD8 and intracellular IFN-c. Data are normalized to the frequency of epitope-specific cells detected when stimulated with the native S598 determinant. (D) Alanine scanning of the S598 Q600Y determinant. Cells were harvested and tested as described for B except in this case the cells originated from the rJ.S Q600Y -infected CNS and were stimulated with 10 nM S598 Q600Y peptide. (E) Alanine scanning of the S598 determinant recognized by S598 Q600Y -primed, cross-reactive CTL. As in C, but cells were stimulated with 150 nM S598 peptide. For B-D, concentrations of peptide equivalent to 106 that required for half maximal stimulation were used; data are mean6SEM from four independent experiments. Note that the differential responses to RCAIFANI in panels C and D reflect the differing amounts of peptide used in the two assays.

In these panels the HC is drawn in green and the peptide in cyan. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000186.g005 than the floor of the cleft. Consequently, the interactions with Ser-99 and Gln-114 of the HC are lost and instead the tyrosine's hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu-152 (",
