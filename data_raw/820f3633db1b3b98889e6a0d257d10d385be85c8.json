            "text": "Background: Rotavirus (RV) is the main cause of severe gastroenteritis in children. An effective vaccination regime against RV can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virus-like particles formed by RV VP2 and VP6 (VLP2/6), as well as that of recombinant adenovirus expressing RV VP6 (rAd), in eliciting protective immunities against RV. However, the efficacy of such prime-boost strategy, which incorporates VLP and rAd in inducing protective immunities against RV, has not been addressed. We assessed the immune effects of different regimens in mice, including rAd prime-VLP2/6 boost (rAd+VLP), VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost (VLP+rAd), rAd alone, and VLP alone. Results: Mice immunized with the VLP+rAd regimen elicit stronger humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses than those immunized with other regimens. RV challenging experiments showed that the highest reduction (92.9%) in viral shedding was achieved in the VLP+rAd group when compared with rAd+VLP (25%), VLP alone (75%), or rAd alone (40%) treatment groups. The reduction in RV shedding in mice correlated with fecal IgG (r = 0.95773, P = 0.04227) and IgA (r = 0.96137, P = 0.038663). Conclusions: A VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost regimen is effective in conferring immunoprotection against RV challenge in mice. This finding may lay the groundwork for an alternative strategy in novel RV vaccine development.",

In contrast, the VLP+rAd group not only elicited high level humoral, mucosal, and cellular immunities, but also protected against RV challenge and effectively reduced the amount of virus shedding.

The reasons for this disparity are unclear. One possible explanation may be the difference in inducing innate immunity between rAd and VLP, which leads to a difference in type and strength of the adaptive immune responses [29] . VLP and rAd are recognized by different pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors [35, 36] , which may lead to differences in cytokine activation. The sequence of prime-boost immunization may also affect the cytokine milieu. This milieu may determine the final direction, strength, and breadth of various adaptive immunities, including the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses through different mechanisms [37] . However, these mechanisms cannot be unravelled by our data alone. A systems biology approach to analyze the markers of the immune responses by different prime-boost regimens may be needed [38] .",

Our correlation analysis between various immune indicators and reduction in RV shedding in mice indicate that a reduction in shedding depends on the levels of fecal IgG antibody (r = 0.95773, P = 0.04227) and IgA antibody (r = 0.96137, P = 0.038663) (see Table 1 ).

Expression of VP6 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody against RV (Biodesign, Cat: B65110G). The virus was titered with an Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to use. VLP2/6 was produced by expression of RV VP2 and VP6 simultaneously in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells through recombinant baculovirus. The recombinant baculovirus was generated by the Bac-to-Bac \u00ae Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RV VLP2/6 was purified by ultracentrifugation as described previously [49, 50] . Briefly, the supernatants of Sf9 cells infected by the recombinant baculovirus were collected at day 5 post infection and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 10,000 rpm). VLP2/6 was precipitated with PEG6000 (final concentration, 6%) from the clarified supernatant. Precipitated pellets were sonicated briefly followed by ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 3 hours through a 40% sucrose cushion. The presence of the purified VLP2/6 was confirmed by Western blot using an anti-RV antibody. Concentrated VLP2/6 were verified by electron microscopy. The concentration of purified VLP2/6 protein was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and proteins were stored at -70\u00b0C prior to use.",
