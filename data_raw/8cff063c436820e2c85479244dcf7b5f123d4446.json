The alignment-free methods are popular nowadays, whereas the manual intervention in those methods usually decreases the accuracy. Also, the interactions among nucleotides are neglected in most methods. Here we propose a new Accumulated Natural Vector (ANV) method which represents each DNA sequence by a point in R 18 . By calculating the Accumulated Indicator Functions of nucleotides, we can further find an Accumulated Natural Vector for each sequence. This new Accumulated Natural Vector not only can capture the distribution of each nucleotide, but also provide the covariance among nucleotides. Thus global comparison of DNA sequences or genomes can be done easily in R 18 . The tests of ANV of datasets of different sizes and types have proved the accuracy and time-efficiency of the new proposed ANV method.",

            "text": "With the rapid development of Next Generation Sequencing technology, more and more information of the genome sequences is available. Studying sequence similarity is a crucial question in research and can explain phylogenetic relationships by constructing trees. One of the most commonly used methods, Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) uses dynamic programming, a regression technique that finds an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different possible alignments and taking the one with the highest score (Yu et al., 2013a) . However, the computational cost of MSA is extremely high and MSA may not produce accurate phylogeny for diverse systems of different families of RNA viruses (Yu et al., 2013b) . Alignment-free approaches have been developed to overcome those limitations. Published alignment-free methods include Markov chain models (Apostolico and Denas, 2008) , chaos theory (Hatje and Kollmar, 2012) , and some other methods based on the statistics of oligomer frequency and associated with a fixed length segment, known as k-mer (Sims et al., 2009) . Yau and his team proposed the natural vector method, which takes the position of each nucleotide into consideration. The natural vector method performs well on many datasets (Deng et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2013b; Hoang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , however, it only considers the number, average position and dispersion of positions of each nucleotide. Relationships between nucleotides are also important, especially when the functions may be related to interactions of nucleotides, such as the folding of a chromosome. In this paper, we propose a new Accumulated Natural Vector (ANV) method, which not only considers the basic property of each nucleotide, but also the covariance between them. In the traditional Natural Vector (NV) method, each sequence is uniquely represented by a single point in R 12 . The traditional Natural Vector approach is firstly introduced in Deng et al. (2011) : for a sequence of length N, n \u03b1 (\u03b1\u01eb{A, C, T, G}) denotes the number of nucleotide \u03b1 in the sequence. s [\u03b1] [v] is the distance from the first nucleotide (regarded as origin) to the v th nucleotide \u03b1 in the DNA sequence. T \u03b1 = n \u03b1 v=1 s [\u03b1] [v] denotes the total distance of each set of A,C,G,T from the origin, \u03b1\u01eb{A, C, T, G}. \u00b5 \u03b1 = T \u03b1 n \u03b1 , is the mean value of the distances of nucleotide \u03b1 from the origin.",

The second dataset consists of the genomes of 38 Influenza A viruses, which is a classic dataset to test if a new proposed method performs well. The third dataset includes 72 viruses from Zheng et al. (2015) , which focuses on the classification of Ebolaviruses. The fourth one is from our colleagues' previous paper (Li et al., 2016) which includes 351 viruses chosen randomly under some criteria. The fifth one is the mitochondrial genomes of 31 mammals, which can be clustered into seven well-known categories. All the sequence materials can be found on NCBI with the reference number provided in the Appendices. We also generated different mutations by simulation in a DNA sequence and constructed phylogenetic trees of simulated sequences to test our ANV method.

The Euclidean distance between two k-mer vectors can also be computed by formula (17). We apply MSA method, ClustalW on several datasets as well, with the default parameters in Mega X. ClustalW is much slower than another MSA algorithm, MUSCLE, while ClustalW can give a better result. MUSCLE is applied on the fourth dataset of 351 viruses and after we get the alignment result of the viruses, distance matrix is calculated using Hamming distance, to find the nearest neighbor of each virus. Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. It measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. Since alignment approaches are to arrange the sequences to identify regions of similarity between the sequences, the alignment would provide the performance of each sequence on a fixed number of positions.

In this paper, we construct a dataset with 36 Coronaviruses, in which 34 viruses are from the exact same dataset with (Woo et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2010 ; Hoang et al., 2015) . The other two viruses are two new members in Coronavirus. Details of the Coronaviruses can be found in Table S1 . The new ChinaGD01 (Lu et al., 2015) was identified in Guangdong Province (China) in 2015 and is an imported Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus. The other one MERS-CoV/KOR is from South Korea (Kim et al., 2015) . As of 15 June 2015, the MERS-COV was spreading in South Korea, and the ChinaGD01 case was a South Korean national who traveled to Guangdong in May 2015. Therefore, those two members were considered highly correlated with each other. The genomic size of Coronaviruses ranges from about 9 to 31 kbp, with the average of 27,567 nucleotides. Using our Accumulated Natural Vector and UPGMA method (Sneath and Sokal, 1973) , we can build up a phylogenetic tree as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 shows that the two new members are clustered together with Group 4, which is also well-known as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries. Both MERS-CoV and SARS viruses are beta-Coronaviruses, however, they belong to different lineages, for more details please see (Drexler et al., 2013; Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) . The phylogenetic tree indicates that the ChinaGD01 and MERS-CoV/KOR forms a monophyletic clade, sister to the SARS clade, which may possibly be a variant from some SARS viruses.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, which have been a major health threat to both human society and animals . Influenza A viruses' nomenclature is based on the surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Obenauer et al., 2006) . HA has 15 subtypes and NA has 9 subtypes, which forms 135 different combinations. The NCBI number of the analyzed 38 Influenza A viruses can be found in Table S2 . Our result agrees with previous work by Hoang et al. (2015) . Furthermore, we find that all the Influenza A viruses are clustered with the same H and N type in Figure 3 , with only one exception of A/turkey/Minnesota/1/1988(H7N9). There is no specific research about this virus and we infer that it may be the intermediate from H7N3 to H7N9. H7N3 had an outbreak in July 2012, causing millions of poultry's infection, but there is no report of infection from human to human yet. However, H7N9 was identified in Shanghai, China at the end of March 2013. Considering that the HA glycoprotein of those two subtypes are the same and the close outbreak date, we indicate that the H7N9 on March 2013 might be a variant from H7N3, and A/turkey/Minnesota/1/1988 (H7N9) plays a key role in this variation. We get the same conclusion in another work as well (Dong et al., 2018) . More biological research on this virus should be done to deepen our understanding of Influenza A viruses to accelerate the invention of an effective vaccine and to prevent more dangerous variants.",

In Figure 6A , the phylogenetic tree shows that from the novel Accumulated Natural Vector method classifies all viruses into the right groups, however, in Figure 6B , the traditional Natural Vector method divides EBOV class into two clusters and SUDV is misclassified with some EBOV virus. This is an indication that including covariance between nucleotides helps improve the accuracy of classification. Hence this is an important improvement to the traditional Natural Vector and other alignment-free methods.",

The average length of them is 11,952 nucleotides and it makes alignment methods on a laptop impossible. Only server or cloud computing can finish such a task. Here we use 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) method (Li et al., 2016) to see the accuracy of the prediction. This evaluation is inspired by the high rate of missing labels in many databases of viruses. For example, if a virus with missing family label has been added to the database, and it should share the same family label with the virus (stored in the database already) that is closest to it, then we can predict the missing family label according to the information of its nearest neighbor. Therefore, for a dataset with no missing labels, we can count how many viruses share the same label with its neighbor. \"Nearest neighbor\" of a specific virus can be defined as the virus that has the smallest Euclidean distance in the dataset to it for the alignment-free methods. For alignment results, we use the Hamming distance to measure the distance between two sequences. If the virus shares its distance with its neighbor, we consider it as a \"correct\" one, since even if its label is missing we can still predict it from its nearest neighbor. The accuracy can be computed by dividing the number of correct ones by the number of all viruses, in this case, by 351. We compare the result of ANV to the k-mer method since they are all alignment-free methods, and the results are shown in Table 3 . The optimal choice of k is made by the same procedure in the other datasets. From Table 3 , it is evident that ANV has much higher accuracy than the k-mer method, meanwhile using much less time. Thus, we have proved that ANV can apply to practical use with high time-efficiency and high-accuracy. For the alignment in this part, we tried to align all the sequences with full length on our server, but it fails to give a reliable result. Therefore, we extract 3,000 bp from the beginning and align 351 pieces of segments all with length of 3,000 bp. The results are shown in Table 3 as well and the accuracy is still not as good as what ANV gives.",

The difference can be attributed to that mitochondrial genomes in mammals may not always reflect the organismal evolutionary history (Morgan et al., 2014) , however, it still keeps more information than k-mer does in Figure 7B , since the distance within each group is smaller than the distances among groups, we can still distinguish clusters based on current dataset. In Ladoukakis and Zouros (2017) , point out that most of the information researchers gained about the tree of life through the use of mtDNA remains valid, while we should pay more attention to its role in the function of the organism and its value as a tool in the study of major evolutionary novelties in the history of life.

We simulated a sequence of length 1,000 bp as a base sequence, and generated two new sequences named \"A_original\" and \"B_original\" using point mutations. Both A and B have 100 nucleotides different from the original sequence. We then similarly evolved A and B into different mutants by four different mutations (substitutions, deletion, insertion, and transposition) as did in Yin et al. (2014) . Table 4 is the detailed description on the simulated DNA sequences with different mutations. Since the sequences are mutated slightly based on an exon sequence, we take the aligned result as the \"correct\" relationships among the sequences, and the alignment is done by the \"seqpdist\" function in MATLAB Bioinformatics toolbox. This function uses the classical Jukes-Cantor algorithm and we calculate the pairwise alignment distance. For comparison, we use the ANV method, FFP method (we test k = 4,5,6 in this case, since the lengths of sequences are about 1,000 bp). The UPGMA trees of alignment, ANV and FFP (k=4) methods are shown in Figures 8, 9A ,B separately. Among these trees, it is not very obvious which one is more similar to the alignment results, therefore we calculate the Robinson-Foulds distances between the distance matrix and the \"correct\" matrix and the results are shown in Table 5 . Here we apply the program named \"Robinson-Foulds\" (Robinson and Foulds, 1981) when calculating Table 5 .",

Results from our analysis largely agree with the earlier studies, which indicates that our approach can detect the similarity and difference among sequences. Therefore, constructing phylogenetic trees only by sequence data could be done accurately in a very reasonable time, without using large computing platforms or conducting biological experiments of high cost. Our method can be applied in a global comparison of all genomes and provide a new powerful tool by including the correlations of nucleotides. We are working on extending the ANV method to protein sequences, nevertheless, for a protein sequence, it would produce an 1,830-dim vector for each sequence. The calculation cost for this is too large under the current technology. The covariance for three amino acids at a time may be more reasonable, since three consequent nucleotides can also become a codon in expression region of a sequence.",
