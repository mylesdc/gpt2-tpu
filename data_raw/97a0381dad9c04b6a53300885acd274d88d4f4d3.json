We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/ 91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.",

A variety of laboratory techniques have been used to survey the epidemiology of animal infectious diseases, among which animal pathogen surveillance and tracking the molecular epidemiology of pathogens are important strategies [1, 2] . These methods usually involve pathogen isolation and identification, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and sequencing analyses. These methods often target a single known a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 pathogen; however, the analysis of multiple pathogens in one or more hosts requires multiple detection methods, personnel, or even laboratories.

Metagenomics has been used to detect and monitor human pathogens [3] , animal pathogens [4] , and plant pathogens [5] . Metagenomics-based detection methods are highly sensitivity, and they do not target any specific pathogens. Instead, they comprehensively scan the entire genome of the samples and, therefore, pathogens can be detected no matter whether they are included in the monitoring plan. Moreover, these methods can even discover the viruses which have not been sequenced, and they can directly analyze the genotypes, virulence, and molecular evolution of pathogens. The use of NGS has been confirmed for detecting microorganisms in human clinical samples [6] [7] [8] and infectious viruses in numerous animal species. The method of preparing the sequencing libraries and the NGS platform used in this study have been evaluated previously [9, 10] , and viruses in clinical samples from single animal hosts have also been detected using the same standard NGS procedure in our laboratory [10] [11] [12] .",

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that all the 36 IBVs could be separated into nine genotypes (Fig 2) , named LX4, CK/ CH/LSC/99I, J2, 4/91, JP, TW, Italy02, TC07-2 and Mass. The three detected IBVs were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes (Table 3) . These three genotypes were also previously found in China [38] , but had not been the most frequently isolated type (LX4) in China in recent years. The NDV detected in the duck farm in Anhui province was proven to be genotype I by HN gene analysis (Fig 3) . Genotype I NDV has been detected in Chinese ducks in recent years [39] . Characterization of the proteolytic cleavage sites of the translated AIV HA and NDV F0 amino acid sequences are shown in Table 3 . The results indicated that all the detected AIVs were low pathogenic viruses, and the NDV was avirulent. The nucleotide sequences of the fragments amplified by RT-PCR in this study are available from GenBank under accession numbers MH487492-MH487500 and MH487502.",

            "text": "We used a metagenomics-based pathogen surveillance method to monitor viral infections in this study. The main infectious viruses in the six poultry farms were shown to be AIV and IBV, followed by NDV, ALV-J, DHBV, and rotavirus G, which is consistent with the current prevalence of poultry viral disease in China [40] . The high prevalence of viruses in the poultry farms could indicate insufficient farm biosecurity. We also analyzed the subtype of AIV, genotypes of NDV and IBV, and pathogenicities of AIV and NDV in this study. All the detected AIVs Table 3 and NDV were low pathogenic or avirulent viruses. These kinds of viruses can be usually found in Chinese poultry farms [41, 42] . The three avian IBVs detected in the three farms were identified as genotypes 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I, and TC07-2, by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes compared with 33 reference viruses. The TC07-2-type was first detected in Guangdong province in 2007 [43] , and classified as CH VI lineage by S1 gene phylogenetic analysis [44] . In this study, the lineage was named as TC07-2-type, consistent with the principles of genotype nomenclature for molecular analysis of IBVs [45] . Because the assembled contigs from the NGS reads was too short (about 250 bp) or located in the genes which was not suitable for phylogenetic analysis, the phylogenetic analysis of AIV and IBV was based on the sequence of PCR fragments. Few reads matched to rotavirus G, DHBV, and ALV-J, and these matched reads were not located on genes available for phylogenetic analysis, and it was therefore not possible to construct phylogenetic trees for these three detected viruses. Because of the low abundance of viruses in the clinical samples, the quantity and quality of the viral sequence in the NGS should be enhanced to analyze the genotype and phylogenetic relationship from the NGS data directly. Because animals are fed in flocks, animal disease surveillance focuses on the infecting pathogens of each flock. Therefore, the metagenomics-based pathogen surveillance method established in this study also focused on poultry groups. The poultry in the same field were considered as a single sampling pool. The high sensitivity of the NGS technology ensures that major kinds of viral pathogens in mixed samples can be detected. In this study, the results were validated by traditional PCR or RT-PCR techniques, which were consistent with the metagenomics-based pathogen surveillance method to certify whether the viruses were percent or absent in the clinical samples. However, this method had some limitations. The absence of pathogens on farms where none were detected by NGS was not confirmed by comparing the current metagenomics results with an independent set of test results. Furthermore, no sequences other than the virus sequences were analyzed. The detection results for the viruses were also related to the types of samples collected. We analyzed collected cloacal/throat double swabs, which could be used to detect major respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, however, other types of infectious viruses, such as Marek's disease virus, Egg drop syndrome virus, Infectious bursal disease virus and so on, could be detected in different types of samples, according to the monitoring purposes. H5 subtype AIV vaccine was used in all the six poultry farms. This study also analyzed the subtypes/genotypes and pathogenicities of the AIV, NDV and IBV strains, which were instructive for the development of better vaccines to control the respective diseases [46, 47] .",
