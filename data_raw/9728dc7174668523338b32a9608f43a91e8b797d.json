A set of primers, composed of two outer primers, two inner primers and two loop primers, was designed based on the gene of interest. The LAMP reaction was conducted in a traditional laboratory water bath at 65 \u00b0C for 50 min. We compared the performance of calcein/Mn 2+ and SYBR Green I dyes, as well as electrophoresis on agarose gel stained with GoldView nucleic acid dye to detect the RT-LAMP-amplified products and all assays could be employed to discriminate between positive and negative specimens in visible or UV light. Our data showed that there is no cross-reaction with other viruses and the RT-LAMP technique displayed high sensitivity for detecting NDRV with a minimal detection limit of 200 fg RNA input. This assay was more sensitive than conventional PCR in detecting NDRV both in natural and experimental infection. In conclusion, the RT-LAMP technique was remarkably sensitive, specific, rapid, simple and profitable for the identification of NDRV.",

            "text": "The disease can be distinguished from Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) infections by clinical presentation of hemorrhagic and necrotic lesions in the liver and spleen and 5-50% mortality rates. Furthermore, the existing commercial vaccines against ARVs or MDRVs fail to prevent NDRV infection and transmission. A reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides a rapid and precise detection assay for viral pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity 4 . This technique is profitable and convenient, only requires a constant temperature water bath and averts some deficiencies, including high necessity for equipment, tremendous cost, lengthened examination period and low sensitivity 5 . In comparison with the equipment required for traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, RT-LAMP is easy to conduct in resource-limited laboratory settings in underdeveloped countries 6 [7] [8] [9] [10] . The ARV structural and molecular compositions are generally similar to those of mammalian reovirus (MRV). However, some of the ARV biological properties differ from mammalian reovirus, which have been shown elsewhere 11, 12 . The S3 segment encoding the \u03c3B protein of duck and MRVs is structurally similar to ARV \u03c3B gene 13 . Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on both sigma C (\u03c3C) and sigma B (\u03c3B)-encoding genes followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were employed to characterize Tunisian ARV isolates 14 . Furthermore, the highly variable sequences of the S3 and M3 have been reported to differentiate between novel duck reovirus (NDR), MDRV and avian reovirus 15 . Thus, a simple, rapid and sensitive diagnostic technique for detection of NDRV is required. The potential application of RT-LAMP assay using the S3 gene of NDRV-NPO3 strain for specific diagnosis of NDRV infection with limited sensitivity and without its utilization in the detection of NDRV in naturally-and experimentally-infected ducks have been reported 16 . In this study, we developed and evaluated a RT-LAMP assay targeting the gene encoding the \u03c3B major outer-capsid protein to detect NDRV in naturally suspected NDRV-infected ducks and experimentally infected ducklings with NDRV.",

Three replications were carried out for each trial. RT-LAMP was performed under different reaction temperatures from 59 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C. The results showed that RT-LAMP at 65 \u00b0C produced very clear and bright bands. Therefore, 65 \u00b0C was selected as the optimal temperature of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction time indicated that 50 min was adequate for reaction completion. The ratio of calcein and manganese ion (1:8-1:128) was analyzed and the color was obvious at the ratio of 1:12. Consequently, the ratio of 1:12 was selected as the optimal ratio to use in proceeding experiments. The effect of Mg 2+ ion concentration was analyzed. Magnesium sulfate (Mg 2+ ) was added at a concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 mM reaction mixtures containing positive sample. Upon gel analysis, bands were obvious at 3 mM Mg 2+ . When the concentration was greater than 3.0 mM (lane 4~7), the reaction efficiency decreased but tended to be stable. Therefore, 3.0 mM was chosen as the best reaction concentration for NDRV RT-LAMP. Moderately various yields were detected with the different amounts of betaine employed and a concentration of 0.5 mM was found to be proper for a more distinct pattern. The size of the ladder increased as the concentration of dNTPs increased and a concentration greater 0.3 mM was found to be sufficient. AMV reverse transcriptase concentration of 0.14 U/\u00b5L was found to be appropriate for the amplification efficiency of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction efficiency decreased as the concentration of the AMV enzyme concentration increased.

Group 1 animals were received intraperitoneal inoculation of NDRV allantoic fluid (Table 4 ). Ducklings from group 2 were intraperitoneally inoculated with physiological saline and served as the control group. Ducklings were followed hourly for 72 hours with their corresponding uninfected-control ones. All ducklings in the infected group died with 72 hours post-infection (hpi). The gross anatomical lesions of the ducklings showed an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and pleural exudates with yellow discoloration 48 hpi and hepatomegaly with brittle texture, plaque bleeding and necrosis, red darken splenomegaly, patchy hemorrhagic necrosis, bursal necrosis, renal bleeding, enlarged heart and inflated intestine 72 hpi (Fig. 6) . Twenty eight samples were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively from different affected organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lung and brain as well as anal swab (sticky stool) and serum were collected. Among the 21 NDRV LAMP-positive specimens, 18 were positive RT-PCR (Table 4 ). The RT-LAMP rapid detection assay was 10.7% (3/28) higher than that of the traditional RT-PCR method. Thus, the conventional RT-PCR method had low sensitivity and is inappropriate for use in diagnosis of NDRV. . The utilization of the six specific primers that recognize distinct regions on the gene encoding the \u03c3B major outer-capsid protein of NDRV assured high specificity of the template nucleic acid amplification. Our data showed that there was no cross-reaction between NDVR and other examined viruses. The RT-LAMP specificity detection of NDRV was in accord with other studies about specificity of RT-LAMP reaction in viral detection [7] [8] [9] [10] 19 . The RT-LAMP assay in the detection of NDRV displayed sufficient sensitivity in addition to its higher specificity. When the nucleic acid and plasmid quantities were checked by the RT-LAMP visualized by calcein assay, the detection limit was found to be 200 fg RNA, which was similar to that of RT-LAMP analyzed by agarose gel and RT-LAMP visualized by SYBR Green I. However, the detection limit of the conventional PCR (20 pg RNA). These results are in line with those of previous studies [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Interestingly, the current assay is more sensitive than the previously reported one 16 . Furthermore, the sensitivity of RT-LAMP in NDRV-infected ducklings (known) and field samples of ducks (suspected NDVR infection) was found to be higher than that of conventional PCR assay. Although the current study is based on a small number of experimental animals, RT-LAMP is a simple and powerful amplification method for the rapid diagnosis and early detection of experimentally NDVR-infected ducklings within 48 hpi.",

We compared the performance of both calcein and SYBR Green I and our results indicated that both assays could be utilized to differentiate between positive and negative samples in visible or UV light.",

The visual inspection result with calcein and SYBR Green I dyes was found to match with gel electrophoresis. Thereby, the visual inspection of LAMP amplified products by employing calcein and SYBR Green I dyes instead of gel electrophoresis made the RT-LAMP assay more rapid and simple.",

The infected ducks revealed the fundamental clinical symptoms with hemorrhage and necrosis in the liver results in high mortality rates in ducks. In China, NDRV causes tremendous economic losses to the duck industry and most of the affected ducks, particularly ducklings died within 72 hpi. Therefore, it is crucially required to develop an easy, rapid, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method for NDRV detection. In this study, we employed RT-LAMP to identify NDVR as a serious pathogen for duck industry in Guangdong province, China.Specificity of the RT-LAMP primers was investigated exploiting Muscovy Duck Reovirus (MDRV), Avian Reovirus (ARV), Duck Disease Virus (DPV), Duck Hepatitis Virus (DHAV), Duck Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), H9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), H5 subtype AIV and duck Tanzuru virus (DTMUV)",
