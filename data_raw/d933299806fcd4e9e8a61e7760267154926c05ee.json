Delay in infectious disease reporting might hamper timely outbreak control measures, such as prophylaxis for contacts, active case finding or identifying and eliminating a common source. In the Netherlands, earlier studies revealed that up to 42% of infectious diseases reported between June 2003 and December 2008 were not notified within 3 days after laboratory confirmation, and there were substantial reporting delays for four of six investigated diseases [1, 2] .",

Under the former Infectious Disease Act from 1998, diseases were notifiable by either physicians (group B notifiable diseases, D3P in Figure 1 ) or laboratories (group C diseases, D3X). When the new Public Health Act came into force in December 2008, both group B and C diseases became notifiable to the MHS for both physicians and laboratories [6] . The notification timeframe of 1 working day remained unchanged, likewise the timeframe for group A diseases, which require immediate notification upon disease suspicion either by physicians or laboratories. The timeframe for reporting from the MHS to the NHS, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM); D6 in Figure 1 ), was reduced for some group B and C diseases: from 7 to 3 days for hepatitis A, Q fever and psittacosis, and from 1 month to 7 days for pertussis and malaria.

Lastly, we included a timeframe for outbreak control calculated by Bona\u010di\u0107 et al. for six person-to-person transmissible diseases based on the proportion (PIR2) of expected new infections produced by each secondary case at the time of notification of the index case to the MHS [2] . An outbreak is controlled, in other words the incidence begins to decline, if the average number of cases produced by an infected person is < 1. The number of cases produced by each secondary case is PIR2 multiplied by the reproduction number. Therefore, outbreak control can be achieved if PIR2 \u00d7 R < 1. The following total local delays (D1) were determined to achieve the outbreak control timeframe: 17 days for hepatitis A, 42 days for hepatitis B, 5 days for measles, 8 days for mumps, 4.5 days for pertussis and 3 days for shigellosis.",

We observed a steady reduction in the median delay by 1 day every 2 years, already starting in period 1. While notification systems involving laboratories generally lead to more timely notifications than those involving only physicians [5] , we observed a longer average notification delay for diseases notifiable for laboratories than for diseases notifiable for physicians in period 1. The gradual decrease since 2003 was probably related to local agreements between MHS, physicians and microbiologists on anonymous pre-notifications for group B diseases by the laboratory. This was recommended under the former law to reduce reporting delay in group B diseases [13] . In our opinion, the variety of notification procedures explains why a substantial delay reduction was only achieved in 2011. In 2016-2017, for all six diseases studied by Reijn et al., the percentage of cases notified more than 3 days after laboratory confirmation was substantially reduced, and legal thresholds were achieved for at least 80% of cases for D3 (82.3%). Nevertheless, for some diseases, notifications by the involved physicians and laboratories still need to become more timely, namely botulism, diphtheria, hantavirus infections, leptospirosis, malaria, and infections with community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and STEC. These diseases have in common that they are rare and may need additional laboratory tests after initial confirmation, which are performed by specialised reference laboratories leading to delay in notification. For STEC infections, this delay is of special concern as early identification of a common source is important. We recommend that MHS monitor notification delays in their region and identify ways of improvement together with local laboratories and involved physicians.",

Timeframes for notification varied between the included studies, but the most common predefined timeframe, either legal or defined for the study itself, was within 48 hours. Timeliness of notification systems was sufficient in only a minority of studies. Notifications by laboratories and by laboratories combined with notifications by physicians, as in the Netherlands, were related to more timely notifications [5, 14] .

In the Netherlands, thresholds for notification within two incubation periods still are not met for bacterial pathogens causing gastrointestinal diseases such as enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and STEC, Shigella and Salmonella typhi fever, which has been observed before [1]. In our opinion, this is related to a short incubation period in combination with patient delay in case of mild disease and doctor delay for not directly initiating laboratory testing. Timeframes for outbreak control involving total local delay (D1) were only met for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and measles, the latter meeting the timeframe for the first time in the period 2013-2017. This was probably a consequence of the outbreak in 2013-2014, when the disease identification delay was reduced by, among other things, the RIVM alert systems. The performance threshold of measles was close to the threshold of 80%. Therefore, we advise to further decrease patient, doctor and laboratory testing delays, especially for bacterial gastroenteritis and measles. Given the current measles outbreaks in Europe and regular imported cases in the Netherlands, we recommend enhancing doctors' awareness and optimising laboratory confirmation procedures to achieve early detection of measles cases for optimal outbreak control [19] .

We recommend including these time points in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks. Although additional data in surveillance systems should, in order to maintain compliance by reporting health professionals, not be requested lightly, insight in these time points is important. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate how these data can be collected automatically in the electronic reporting systems at a minimal workload for the notifying health providers. As an alternative, these data can be collected only when specifically needed during outbreaks when healthcare providers will be more motivated to provide this information.",

Incompleteness of notified infectious diseases is an even larger concern for public health than delayed notification. Completeness rates for laboratory-confirmed hospitalised pertussis cases have been determined as low as 16.5-22% for cases 2 years and older and between 52-61% for children younger than 2 years [22] . Reporting completeness during the measles outbreak in 2013-2014 has been estimated as low as 9%, although this is mainly the result of patients not seeking medical care (underascertainment) [23] . Better insight in notification completeness is necessary, at local as well as national level, in order to improve the surveillance system.",

To achieve outbreak control thresholds, also disease identification delays need to be reduced, which especially applies for measles and bacterial gastroenteritis. We recommend including dates of doctor's consultation and laboratory request into notification records to determine patient, doctor and laboratory delays during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.",
