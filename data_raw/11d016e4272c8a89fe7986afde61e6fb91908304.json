Bacterial diversity was lower in culture-positive samples for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, compared to cultured-negative samples. URI frequencies were positively associated with increasing trend in otopathogen colonization. AOM frequencies were associated with decreasing trend in Micrococcus colonization. During URI and AOM, there were increases in abundance of otopathogen genera and decreases in Pseudomonas, Myroides, Yersinia, and Sphingomonas. Otopathogen abundance was increased during symptomatic viral infection, but not during asymptomatic infection. The risk for AOM complicating URI was reduced by increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Sphingobium.",

It is well known that the three otopathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) colonize the nasopharynx from early infancy but bacterial AOM only occurs after viral URI [10] [11] [12] . Less is known about the colonization of commensals and their dynamics during viral URI. Existing data suggest interference between otopathogens and commensals [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, enhancement of commensal colonization may interfere with otopathogen colonization leading to disease prevention. Investigators have studied the effect of selected commensal bacteria, e.g. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, the so-called 'probiotic bacteria', in preventing URI and recurrent AOM, but the results have been mixed [16] [17] [18] . It is possible that effective probiotic component may require combinations of protective commensals. Refinement of probiotics for prevention of URI and AOM depends on better knowledge and understanding of respiratory tract microbiota and pathogen, commensal, and viral interactions.",

Our results suggested that bacterial otopathogen genera (Haemophilus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella) played the key role in the disease process. The increasing trend in colonization of these otopathogen genera was also correlated positively with frequencies of URI, and their presence was associated with URI symptom expression during viral infection. Interestingly, Staphylococcus, but not the commonly used probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium, played an important role in counteracting the deleterious effect of otopathogens. The availability of comprehensive clinical, bacteriologic, and virologic data allowed us to determine the significance of pathogens, commensals, and their interactions with viruses during URI and AOM. Microbiome analyses further expanded the knowledge on commensal bacteria not traditionally cultured or non-culturable. During symptomatic viral infection, there were significant increases in relative abundance of otopathogen genera, while there was no significant change in otopathogen or commensals during asymptomatic viral infection. The finding on symptoms associated with increased otopathogen abundance agrees with a finding from a recent study suggesting that both viruses and bacteria contributed to acute upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms [9] . Microbiome stability found during asymptomatic viral infection helps explain why asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM, which we previously reported from this subject cohort [23] .",

It must be pointed out that the average age at the time of sample collection was older in the AOM group compared to no AOM group. It is known that infants <6 months are less often diagnosed with AOM compared to older infants. Our data, although from a small number, suggest that one of the factors preventing AOM development in young infants is colonization with Staphylococcus, which helps counteract with the otopathogens. Our previously published report from this cohort [26] has shown the highest S. aureus colonization rate (25%) in samples collected at age 1 month, with declining in rate to 12% by age 6 months, along with increasing rates of colonization of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. Others have also shown the negative association between S. aureus colonization and otopathogen colonization [27] [28] [29] . Because S. aureus colonization in young infants is not associated with invasive infections [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , Staphylococcus colonization may be beneficial than harmful to these young infants. Not only Staphylococcus protected them from otopathogen colonization but it also helped prevent the transition from URI to AOM. In other studies, nasopharyngeal bacterial commensals were studied mainly in children > 6 months of age, and the samples were often collected during disease state [19, 20, 31] . Our data were from infants, 86% of whom were 1-6 months. Therefore, commensal genera in our subjects were somewhat different than those reported from older and/ or sick children. In a recent study [7] , samples were collected from 102 healthy individuals at 24-36 hours after delivery, 7 and 14 days, and 1, 2, 3 4 and 6 months; the commensal genera shown were more comparable to ours. Not only age has been shown to affect nasopharyngeal microbiota, numerous other factors such as mode of delivery, infant feeding type, antibiotic use, vaccines, etc. have also been found to affect microbiota in healthy children [7, 20, 32, 33] . Nevertheless, Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum have consistently been found to be the two most common commensal genera in the nasopharynx of children.",

Aside from Staphylococcus, Proteobacteria such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Yersinia, and Bacteroides (Myroides) were significantly reduced. Decreasing trend in colonization with Micrococcus was associated with increased AOM frequencies in the first 6 months. The role of these less common commensals in counteracting with otopathogens and preventing AOM deserves further investigations.",

However, Bosch et al. [7] have shown that S. pneumoniae represented a high proportion of the Streptococcus genus in the samples collected from infants > 1 month. Similarly, Teo et al. [9] showed in a study of infants 2-12 months of age that otopathogen genera were dominated by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. In addition, our bacterial culture data confirmed the relationship between the increased bacterial otopathogen colonization during URI and laboratory-confirmed viral infections.",

Previous studies have used both oral and intranasal probiotics containing alpha streptococci, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium; results have been mixed [16, 34] . We have not found the Lactobacillus genus to be a major nasopharyngeal commensal and we do not have the data on alpha streptococci. Bifidobacterium was commonly found in our samples, ranked 5th among the commensal genera; we did not find it play a role during URI or AOM process. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium was found more commonly in samples from infants with AOM in the first year of life. Our data suggest that intranasal use of Bifidobacterium may not be helpful as a probiotic. Corynebacterium, the most common commensal was found to be significantly lower in samples from infants with AOM in the first year (Table 2) , but we observed no other significant difference during the URI or AOM process. Other bacteria that played a reverse role with otopathogens such as Yersinia and Pseudomonas may not be appropriate probiotics for their possible roles as pathogens.",
