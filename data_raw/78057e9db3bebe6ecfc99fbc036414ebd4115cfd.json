            "text": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) provides the reducing agent NADPH to meet the cellular needs for reductive biosynthesis and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE 2 occurred upon TNF-\u03b1 stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF-\u03b1-induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-\u03baB. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF-\u03b1 treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF-\u03b1-mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF-\u03b1-mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-\u03baB/ COX-2 signaling.",

G6PD involves the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, which then produces a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to fulfill the cellular needs for cellular reductive biosynthesis and redox balance [2] . G6PD deficiency affects cellular functions in nucleated cells, including dysregulated cellular signaling, increased cell senescence or apoptosis and enhanced susceptibility to viral infection [1] . G6PD deficiency increases the risk for degenerative diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] . Knockdown of G6PD by RNA interference renders HepG2 cells highly susceptible to H 2 O 2 -induced cell death because of impaired dephosphorylation signaling [7] . In macrophages, G6PD increases the activation of the p38 MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases) and NF-\u03baB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells) pathways, which may lead to an increased inflammatory response [8] . These findings indicate that the G6PD plays an important role in modulating cellular signaling and physiological responses.",

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a ROS (Reactive oxygen species) source in cells besides mitochondria [14] [15] [16] . NOXs are a family of proteins, including NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, Duox1 and Duox2, and play a major role in regulating cellular functions, especially membrane-bound NOX in different cell types [17, 18] . NOX uses NADPH as a substrate to produce ROS that can induce cell signaling or directly interact with pathogens to protect cells from infection [19] [20] [21] . A change in redox status has been implicated in initiating inflammatory responses through the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and other signal transduction pathways, including MAPKs, leading to the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory genes [22] [23] [24] . The inflammatory response is also a powerful weapon for the host to be able to fight against pathogen infections. Because G6PD plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, it will be of paramount importance to delineate how G6PD deficiency can affect immune responses as a result of redox imbalance.",

The effects of G6PD knockdown on the induction level of COX-2 and PGE 2 was analyzed. Furthermore, the involvement of signaling pathway known to mediate regulation of COX-2/PGE 2 on coronavirus infection was identified. The results clearly show that the down-regulation of COX-2 and subsequent decline of PGE 2 impair antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment.

As shown in S1A and S1B Fig, G6PD activities and protein expression were decreased by approximately 90% in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control cells. The effect of G6PD deficiency on the COX-2 expression transcriptional level upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment was determined. G6PD-kd A549 cells displayed decreased COX-2 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner, and COX-2 promoter activity was attenuated by G6PD silencing (Fig 1A and 1B) . At the translational level, TNF\u03b1 enhanced the accumulation of COX-2 protein in a time-dependent manner with a maximal response within 3-6 h in A549 scramble control cells (Fig 1C) , similar to previous reports [29] . A decreased pattern of COX-2 protein was observed in G6PD-kd cells (Fig 1C) . In parallel with the increased expression of COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 also induced a time-dependent increase of PGE 2 synthesis, the downstream arachidonic acid metabolite product of COX-2. G6PD-kd A549 cells exhibited less PGE 2 synthesis than that of scramble control cells ( Fig  1D) . Our results demonstrated that G6PD acts as a positive regulator in the TNF-\u03b1-triggered inflammatory response and is not a result of the levels of TNFR1 expression in these two types of cells (S1B Fig) .",

These findings are consistent with our previous findings [26, 32] . We further analyzed whether impaired COX-2/ PGE 2 expression via TNF-\u03b1 stimulation plays a role in increasing viral replication in G6PD-kd cells and used viral gene expression to represent viral replication. In doing so, we found that TNF-\u03b1 inhibited viral replication in both scramble control and G6PD-kd cells (Fig 1F) . Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1-induced COX-2 expression by celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) enhanced viral replication in scramble control cells but not in G6PD-kd A549 cells.

NOX activation was not significant in G6PD-kd A549 cells, while an increase in NOX activation was observed within 120 min in scramble control A549 cells upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment (Fig 5A) . In addition, G6PD knockdown decreased the expressions of NOX subunits, as indicated by the transcriptional and translational levels of the NOX subunits compared to those of the scramble control (Fig 5B and 5C) . Moreover, NOX2 inhibition was accompanied by an increase in viral replication in scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells (Fig 5D and S2C Fig) . These results suggest that G6PD modulated NOX activity by providing a substrate for NOX and affecting the expression of NOX subunits.

Physiologically, the activation of NOX can trigger the production of chemokines and inflammation-associated proteins upon viral infection [19, 45, 46] . NOX2 and Duox play a role in the clearance of viral infection [35, 47, 48] . In the present study, we have found that the replication level of coronavirus is decreased by NOX inhibition and COX-2 activation as well as G6PD Status Affects TNF-\u03b1-Triggered COX-2 Response PGE 2 secretion upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment are diminished in G6PD-kd A549 cells. More interestingly, increased viral replication is observed by using COX-2 inhibitor in A549 cells. Together, these findings indicate that COX-2/PGE 2 production actually improves anti-coronaviral infection in airway epithelial cells. Such notion is also supported by the finding that viral N gene is decreased by pretreatment with exogenous PGE 2 (data not shown). These data are also in agreement with other group's findings, showing that COX-2/PGE 2 production inhibits viral replication via the upregulation of antiviral cytokines (i.e. IL-32, IL-27, IFN-\u03bb1) [30] [31] 49] in A549 cells. In contrast to our observation, it has been reported that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE 2 enhanced antiviral activity against virus infection in various kinds of cells [50] [51] [52] . Possible explanations for these contradicting results include different virus species, conditions for the pretreatment of TNF-\u03b1 in cells, and different regulatory signalings between coronavirus and other upper respiratory tract virus for triggering innate immune response. Nevertheless, our new findings provide additional argument for the notion that NOX-mediated COX-2 signaling can be modulated by G6PD for triggering antiviral response.",

            "text": "Our new findings provide a link between G6PD and downstream NF-\u03baB signaling that has been documented to be involved in several cellular responses to stimuli [53] , particularly in the regulation of the immune response to pathogen stimulation. Dysregulation of NF-\u03baB has been implicated in inflammation, viral infection, autoimmune diseases and improper immune development [54] [55] [56] . It has been found that G6PD-overexpressing macrophages increase the expression of proinflammatory genes via the activation of NF-\u03baB [8] . Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that G6PD knockdown impairs NF-\u03baB signaling triggered by NOX activity in the present report. When cells are infected by pathogens, cytokines are released, followed by the induction of inflammatory mediators. The increased levels of inflammatory mediators play a protective role or initiate an irreversible immune response leading to cell death. Thus, the current study provides novel evidence to suggest that TNF-\u03b1-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling is, in part, modulated by a close interaction between G6PD and NOX. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the detailed interaction between these two well-known enzymes.",

TNF-\u03b1-mediated COX-2 expression is decreased by G6PD knockdown via the down-regulation of NOX-dependent pathways. G6PD knockdown can affect viral infection by decreasing the epithelial inflammatory response. A schematic representation depicts the signaling mechanism concerning G6PD deficiency on COX-2 expression (Fig 6) . These findings enhance the understanding of how TNF-\u03b1 signaling is affected by G6PD knockdown via a close interaction with NOX, and these novel findings should have potential clinical implications.",

Data are the means \u00b1SD, n = 3. *p<0.05. (C) The expression level of NOX subunits were determined by western blot in scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells. \u03b2-Actin expression was shown as the loading control. Numbers represent relative fold differences of protein levels on the basis of densitometer quantitation. Data are means \u00b1SD of three separate experiments, *p<0.05 vs. scramble control. (D) Scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells were infected with coronavirus (0.1 MOI) for 8 h upon universal negative control (NC) or NOX2-targeting siRNA pretreatment, and the infected cells were harvested for analyzing viral mRNA expression.

Physiologically, stimulus by a low dosage of TNF-\u03b1 causes cellular ROS production through the activation of NOX and downstream signaling (MAPK/NF-\u03baB). The activated NOX/MAPK/c-JUN/NF-\u03baB signaling is concomitant with the increased expression of COX-2 and production of PGE 2 . G6PD knockdown results in the reduced generation of cellular NADPH and an impairment of TNF-\u03b1-induced NOX activation. Consequently, COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production are also less in G6PD-knockdown cells, suggesting the participation of G6PD in the TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory response against viral infection.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153462.g006",
