            "text": "Background: Despite the convergence of rapid technological advances in genomics and the maturing field of ecoimmunology, our understanding of the genes that regulate immunity in wild populations is still nascent. Previous work to assess immune function has relied upon relatively crude measures of immunocompetence. However, with next-generation RNA-sequencing, it is now possible to create a profile of gene expression in response to an immune challenge. In this study, captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata; adult males) were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle to stimulate the innate immune system. 2 hours after injection, birds were euthanized and hypothalami, spleen, and red blood cells (RBCs) were collected. Taking advantage of the fully sequenced genome of zebra finch, total RNA was isolated, sequenced, and partially annotated in these tissue/cells. Results: In hypothalamus, there were 707 significantly upregulated transcripts, as well as 564 and 144 in the spleen and RBCs, respectively, relative to controls. Also, 155 transcripts in the hypothalamus, 606 in the spleen, and 61 in the RBCs were significantly downregulated. More specifically, a number of immunity-related transcripts (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, RSAD2, SOCS3) were upregulated among tissues/cells. Additionally, transcripts involved in metabolic processes (APOD, LRAT, RBP4) were downregulated. Conclusions: These results suggest a potential trade-off in expression of genes that regulate immunity and metabolism in birds challenged with LPS. This finding is consistent with a hypothermic response to LPS treatment in small birds. Unlike mammals, birds have nucleated RBCs, and these results support a novel transcriptomic response of avian RBCs to immune challenge.",

            "text": "Resources are rarely ubiquitous within an environment. This is especially true for organisms that migrate and/or experience seasonal alterations in life-histories. The energetically costly activities of reproduction, molt, and migration are typically cyclic [1] . In most birds, reproduction occurs on a seasonal basis when food is most abundant and generally does not conflict with other life-history events, such as molting and migration [2, 3] . Resources are also needed to combat pathogens, and immune defense is allocated strategically among life-history activities (e.g., sexual signaling, reproduction, growth; [4, 5] ). These trade-offs of immune defense with other behavioral and physiological activities can serve as proximate underpinnings that shape life-history decisions [6] . The innate immune system involves rapid, indiscriminate responses [7] , initiated by pattern recognition receptors that are highly conserved among vertebrates [8, 9] . The acute phase response (APR) is the first level of defense against infection as part of the innate immune system [8] . This rapid response, within hours of infection, is characterized by behavioral and physiological alterations. Stereotypical behavioral changes are known as \"sickness behaviors\" and include lethargy, somnolence, reduced food and water intake, and decreased activities such as grooming [10, 11] . Physiological changes occur through upregulation of genes that lead to translation of proteins that regulate fever and inflammation (interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)), and downregulation of genes associated with reproduction and growth ( [12, 13] . The APR can also be triggered by exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria in a dosedependent manner [14] . Importantly, use of LPS avoids the confounding effect of pathogen manipulation upon the immune system, such that measurement of host immune responses can be accurately quantified [10] .",

Of the studies that have examined the innate immune system, and more specifically the APR, most have used mammals and domesticated birds [8, 17, 18] . Studies on free-living organisms are less common. The interdisciplinary field of ecoimmunology aims to understand how immune responses are related to host fitness, along with environmental and genetic variability, in non-model organisms [19] . However, ecoimmunology studies have typically used few markers to measure immunocompetence [20] .

However, gene transcripts that directly influenced growth or reproduction were not transcriptionally down-regulated in response to LPS. Rather, transcripts responsible for regulating metabolism exhibited down- regulation. Because we examined the genomic response to LPS on an acute time scale (2 h post-challenge), it is possible that genes responsible for controlling growth and/or reproduction may occur at a later time frame following immune challenge. For example, in whitecrowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophyrs), the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is suppressed 24 h after LPS injection as measured by a reduction in plasma luteinizing hormone concentration [25] . Genes involved with the stress response were upregulated within the hypothalamus in response to LPS challenge. This response is consistent with rapid activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that occurs during the APR, including in birds [25, 26] . Given the well-known function of the spleen in regulating immunity, it was not surprising that immune function and cytokine production genes were activated in the spleen. However, the increased expression of immune-related and cytokine production-related genes in avian RBCs indicates a novel function of nucleated RBCs. Most studies to date have assumed that RBCs play little or no role in regulating immunity, but only a few have examined nonmammalian RBCs [27, 28] .",

Although many endotherms exhibit fever when challenged with LPS, in small songbirds, such as the zebra finch, hypothermia results with a concurrent decrease in metabolic rate [14] , which likely explains why genes associated with metabolism were down-regulated rather than up-regulated. It is hypothesized that in small endotherms, the heat loss from a fever response would be more detrimental than the purported advantages [29] . Hyperthermia, experienced by most of the larger endotherms (pigs, goats, and chickens), and hypothermia in small birds, is thought to be regulated by the same inflammatory and stress signals that trigger fever [30] . In the hypothalamus, feeding behavior and hormone-related processes were also down-regulated.

            "text": "Some of the notable genes involved with stress response were RSAD2, SOCS3, and EIF4EBP1. Also known as viperin, RSAD2 is upregulated in response to H5N1 avian flu [32] and dengue infections [33] through involvement in interferon and cytokine signaling pathways. RSAD2 is upregulated in chicken kidney samples following avian infectious bronchitis virus exposure [34] , suggesting that RSAD2 might be induced during early infection. SOCS3 and EIF4EBP1 are associated with the inhibition of interferon production via a negative feedback loop that prevents interferon and other inflammatory cytokines from inducing immunopathology [35] . SOCS3 was upregulated Table 2 List of upregulated and downregulated transcripts found in all three tissues, following lipopolysaccharide challenge. Column headers show the Ensembl transcript ID tag, gene symbol, full gene name as description, the log base 2 transformed fold change (FC) for hypothalami (HYP), spleen (SPL), and red blood cells (RBC) compared to controls, respectively, and the corresponding q-value of the gene for each tissue [36, 37] . EIF4EBP1 augments the innate immune system as a translational repressor of interferon production [38] . EIF4EBP1 acts by repressing expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), thereby repressing interferon production [39] . Without EIF4EBP1 repression, IRF7 triggers interferon production, creating a positive feedback loop for further IRF7 and interferon production. IRF7 was not significantly upregulated in these samples (0.964-fold change, q-value 0.191), and interferon was not present. However, there was upregulation in IRF1 (2.975fold change; Additional file 2). The products of IRF1 also trigger an interferon response during early infection. A moderate upregulation in IRF1 transcription was seen in chicken lung following H9N2 infection [32] and IRF1 knock-out mice cannot survive West Nile virus infection [40] . In hypothalamus, IL-1\u03b2 was not significantly upregulated (q-value of 0.053), but this does not discount a possible biological significance, especially when examining the fold change (5.132) and results found in the other tissues examined (fold change value 7.184 in spleen and 2.129 in RBC). Genes associated with metabolism and cellular and protein localization were down-regulated in LPS-treated birds. The CALCA gene encodes several peptide hormones, including calcitonin and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), that are linked to glucose and lipid metabolism [41] . CGRP is also involved in controlling inflammation through anti-inflammatory actions [42, 43] . In chronic inflammation disorders, such as inflammatory response syndrome in dogs, CALCA is upregulated [44] , where it inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) cytokines [42] . Tsujikawa et al. [45] documented this anti-inflammatory effect 24 h after LPS treatment in mice, where cytokine levels were highest 3-6 h post-treatment.",

Decreased transcription in favor of the amino acids being used for producing positive acute phase reactants, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF, that also inhibit RBP4 likely potentiates the APR [46] [47] [48] . Metabolic GO terms associated with this gene include 'gluconeogenesis' and 'positive regulation of insulin secretion,' and it has been linked with human obesity [49] . The RBP4 protein is required for the transport and utilization of retinol (vitamin A) from the liver to peripheral tissues [50] where retinol derivatives are involved in lipid metabolism [51] . However, retinol has been shown to enhance recovery from infection via actions in lymphoid tissues and its role in immune cell development (neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells; [52] ). During the APR, already circulating retinol can be utilized, but less will be transported from the liver due to the downregulation of RBP4 transcription [50] . Consequently, the immune system of malnourished individuals, with less circulating retinol before infection, may have a decreased ability to combat infection.",

All of the downregulated genes discussed here participate in metabolism and/or feeding behaviors. CALCA has antiinflammatory actions [42, 43] which are depressed during the APR in this study. The reduction in feeding behaviors by the downregulation of CALCA, PMCH, and TYH may lower the risk of being a predatory target when searching for food when the animal is not in optimal health. The TYH enzyme product facilitates catecholamine synthesis (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine), further affecting brain functions such as attention, memory, and cognition [56] .

Retinoic acid activates and increases cytokine production in the innate immune system and is used by dendritic, B, and T cells in the adaptive immune system [71] . Increased conversion of retinol by the upregulation of ALDH1A3 also decreases the limited serum retinol resulting from the downregulation in transcription of its transporter, RBP4.

TLR3 propagates signals after being induced by interferons and cytokines and is involved in RIG-I and MDA5 pathways [89] . Upregulation of TLR and IFIH1 (MDA5) is documented in chickens infected with H5N1, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIV) H7N1, and avian Tembusu virus (ATMUV) that cause great economic loss and present a danger to humans [90] . Once activated, the gene encoding MDA5 initiates further signal transduction for cytokine secretion. MDA5 is the primary influenza A virus sensor for chickens [89] . The upregulation of TLR3 is one gene that can be used to assess RIG-I or MDA5 expression, depending on the avian species.",
