            "text": "We investigated whether circulating osteopontin (OPN) could be used as a biomarker for cervical cancer. We employed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 659) specific for the unique and intact thrombin-sensitive site in OPN using an inhibition ELISA. We found significantly higher levels of OPN in 33 cervical cancer patients in both the plasma (mean +/-SD, 612 +/-106 ng/ mL) and serum (424 +/-121 ng/mL) compared to healthy subjects [409 +/-56 ng/mL, from 31 plasma samples (P < 0.0001), and 314 +/-98 ng/mL, from 32 serum samples (P = 0.0002), respectively]. Similar results were obtained when the plasma from a bigger group (147 individuals) of cervical cancer patients (560 +/-211 ng/mL) were compared with the same plasma samples of the healthy individuals (P = 0.0014). More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 +/-210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and nondiscriminatory in stage I (473 +/-110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318). No such discrimination was found when a mAb of a different specificity (mAb 446) was used in a similar inhibition ELISA to compare the two groups in the first study; a commercial capture ELISA also failed. The possibility that the target epitope recognized by the antibody probe in these assays was absent from the circulating OPN due to protein truncation was supported by gel fractionation of the OPN found in patients' plasma: 60-64 kDa fragments were found instead of the presumably full-length OPN (68 kDa) seen in healthy people. How these fragments are generated and what possible role they play in cancer biology remain interesting questions.",

Cleavage of this site by thrombin, which normally occurs in the circulation, fragments the protein roughly into two equal halves, each with different biological activities. The amino-terminal half of the protein binds to a variety of cell surface integrins, such as \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b18\u03b21, through the arginine-glycine-aspartate ( 159 RGD 161 ) motif in the protein, and also with \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b19\u03b21 integrins, through the thrombin-generated site ( 162 SVVYGLR 168 ). The carboxy-terminal half interacts with the CD44 cell surface splice variants, CD44v6 and CD44v3 [4, 5] . Through these various extracellular interactions, thrombin-activated OPN plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes, such as bone remodeling, inflammation, and wound healing [6], as well as in various pathologies, including autoimmunity [7-9] and tumor metastasis [10] or progression [11, 12] . Thrombin-activated OPN has also been reported to inhibit the apoptosis in, or promote the survival and proliferation of, cancer cells [3] .",

Significantly increased levels of circulating OPN were also reported for several types of cancer including cervical cancer [26] , prostate cancer [28] , and colorectal cancer [29] . However, there were conflicting reports regarding head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [30, 31] . In addition, different diagnostic kits were found to yield quite different results from one another for the same patient samples [32] . We were interested to use this non-invasive method to examine our cervical cancer patients. This type of cancer is very common in Hong Kong [24]; it is highly invasive and lethal since the disease can progress rapidly and asymptomatically from preclinical-lesion to overt cancer. We were disappointed with the results obtained initially using a commercial OPN detection kit, and consequently decided to devise our own detection assays. We herein describe the development of such an assay based on the use of a unique monoclonal antibody and an assay format that is used infrequently-inhibition ELISA.",

First, it is known that digestion of OPN by thrombin produces two fragments of roughly equal size. Accordingly, we incubated intact OPN (obtained commercially) with increasing amounts of thrombin and monitored the result using mAb 659 in an ELISA to detect how much intact OPN remained: increasing degradation was observed with increasing enzyme (Fig 3A) . In contrast, this effect was not observable when probed with mAb 446 (Fig 3A) . Secondly, using mAb 659 as probe, full-length OPN could be observed as a 72 kDa band in Western blots; this disappeared completely when the protein was pre-treated with 5 U/ml thrombin (Fig 3B, upper panel) , while smaller amounts of thrombin had little or no effect. When mAb 446 was used to probe the same blot where 5 U/ mL thrombin had been used, there was also significant reduction in the amount of full-length OPN but for reasons unclear, this did not disappeared completely; more importantly, an additional antigen of 35 kDa appeared (Fig 3B, lower panel) . Thirdly, mAb 659 was able to protect OPN from thrombin digestion in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig 3C) . concentration of detecting antibody used was pre-determined from the titration curves of these mAbs (data not shown), chosen at 70% maximal binding (Fig 2B) . Full-length OPN obtained commercially or produced from mouse NS0 cells as histidine 6 -tagged proteins, was used as the standard. Assay sensitivity was determined as the concentration of full-length OPN (ng/mL) required to inhibit the maximal antibody binding by 50%. The sensitivities obtained for the different assays are shown in Fig 4A. Of particular note is the excellent detection by mAb 659 (25 ng/mL) when OPN-O-GST was used as substrate, compared to the poor detection by mAb 446 (200 ng/mL); both antibodies detected the commercially-obtained full-length OPN very poorly (200 ng/mL). Detection by mAb 492 was extremely poor with all OPN substrates.",

We found convincing evidence proving this. However, this was only true because we had used a very unique mAb in a highly-sensitive but not-so-common detection system. This mouse antibody (mAb 659) is highly specific for the unique thrombin-sensitive site in OPN, and OPN is efficiently detected from a patient by its ability to block the binding between this antibody and the target antigen. Thus, although healthy people were found to have nominal amounts of OPN in their blood in the assay, cancer patients showed significantly higher levels depending on several factors. This discrimination was found in two separate cohorts of cervical cancer patients. Plasma samples gave better results than serum in this assay, the reason being the fact that, as the blood clots to form serum, thrombin is activated which can digest the OPN in the sample. Presumably the conditions were not met for complete degradation of the protein. Validity of the plasma mAb 659 inhibition ELISA results is shown not only by the good correlation between these results and those of the corresponding serum samples, but also between these and the OPN gene expression results. Further validation is seen when the patients are re-grouped according to the stage of the disease: the OPN levels found by the ELISA increased with the severity of the disease. Thus, the most severe of these, stage III-IV, showed the highest level of antigen, while at the other extreme, the least severe, stage I, could not be distinguished from healthy individuals. Indeed, the ability to detect stage I patients possibly poses the greatest challenge to all of immunological assays.",

These OPN fragments, which by inference must bear the intact thrombin-sensitive site, are probably truncated somewhere at the N-terminal end of the protein based on the observation that two immunoassays used in parallel with the mAb 659 inhibition ELISA had failed to detect similar OPN increases in the cancer patients: (1) An inhibition ELISA which uses mAb 446 as the detecting reagent known to bind to the N-terminal half of OPN (actual location unknown). (2) A commercially-available capture ELISA (Human OPN Detection Kit, IBL) which employed polyclonal antibodies directed at two sites in OPN separated by 138 amino-acids, one of which ( 17 IPVKQADSGSSEEKQ 31 ) is situated at the N-terminal end of the protein (Fig 1) . Since this capture assay detects NS0-derived full-length OPN as efficiently as the mAb 659 inhibition ELISA, a likely reason for its failure is the absence of the N-terminal site in the patient's OPN. The fact that this commercial kit was successfully used with other types of cancer previously [26] suggests that OPN might be cleaved differently (by different enzymes) in different types of cancer or in different individuals.",

A distinct advantage of this format is the fact that the target site needs only be present in fragments or peptides as small as the site itself. It is instructive that at the start of our study, we had actually experimented with pairs of mAbs (e.g. biotinylated-mAb 659 and -mAb 446) in capture ELI-SAs to detect plasma OPN from patients, but none had succeeded. In general, inhibition assays are not common, but one which has proven efficacious in detecting typhoid fever is based on a rapid dual-particle system ('TUBEX') to detect a single specificity of antibody [36] .",

            "text": "The OPN fragments were indirectly identified from pooled patient plasma by gel filtration. Although the results are preliminary and need to be verified more robustly in terms of sample size and methodology, they nevertheless merit some discussion. To compensate for the imprecision of the fractionation, the Bio-Gel columns were carefully calibrated using known markers and the results were based on a comparison of the plasma samples between the cancer and healthy groups run under identical conditions. Against this background, a notable difference in the P30 elution profiles between the two groups was indeed found: whereas in healthy people the bulk of the OPN antigenic activity appeared in the void fraction (fraction 2), in the cancer group, this appeared later (fraction 3)-suggesting an antigen smaller in size i.e. cleaved. Support for this is seen when the P60 or P100 elution profiles between these groups are compared. Thus, in the case of P60, whereas in healthy people the main antigenic activity was found in fraction 3, this appeared much later in fraction 5 in the cancer group, and there was a greater spread of activity. Western blot analysis performed on the P60 fractions using the same antibody probe (mAb 659) confirmed the ELISA findings. Thus, the main antigenic activity was found in fractions 3 and 5 from the healthy and cancer groups, respectively. More instructively, the antigen found in patients was significantly smaller (about 62 kDa) than that observed in healthy people (about 68 kDa). It seems likely the latter is the intact, full-length OPN even though it is slightly smaller than the intact OPN (72 kDa) produced by HL60 cells used early in our study-this difference could be due to post-translational modification (see later). Thus, the 62 kDa antigen found in patients is not intact but a major fragment. Interestingly, this fragment was also observed in healthy people as a minor component. In the patients too, other fragments (64 kDa in fraction 4 and 60 kDa in fraction 6) were also found in smaller quantities. It is possible that these three antigens are actually the same fragment but have varying degrees of posttranslational modification. Such modifications can increase the molecular weight of the protein considerably. This is highly possible with OPN because although the protein is only roughly half as long (amino-acid) as BSA, it nevertheless has a very similar molecular weight. Indeed, OPN is known to be extensively phosphorylated because of which it is highly active biologically [37, 38] . There are indeed many potential sites in the protein both for phosphorylation (about 36 sites) and for glycosylation (5 for O-glycosylation, 2 for N-glycosylation) [39] [40] [41] . In addition, the protein also undergoes sulfation and transglutamination.",

This enzyme cleaves OPN at two sites, Asp135 and Asp 157 (Fig 1) , yielding two major peptides of 180 and 160 amino-acid long, respectively, but both could yield molecular weights greater than 40 kDa [15] depending on the extent of post-translational modification. While these glycan or phosphate appendages mattered importantly to the linearized antigen in Western blotting by way of increasing the molecular weight, they do not seem to affect the molecular size of the free-form antigen in solution. Thus, in the P30 gel chromatography, the OPN antigen appeared more like a globular protein with a molecular weight of less than 30-40 kDa (i.e. a peptide with fewer than 270 amino-acids) than a 60 kDa antigen as deduced by Western blotting. The possibility that this antigen could be retarded in its passage through the gel due to interaction between the appended phosphate or carbohydrate groups and the Bio-Gel resin is belittled by the observation that the OPN antigen from healthy people seemed to be unaffected.",

On the one hand, this seems unlikely because the same fragment found in patients was also present in healthy people. Indeed, the greater abundance of this fragment in patients may simply reflect the general heightened activity of tumor cells-not only more OPN is produced, but also very quickly it becomes cleaved by the caspases and other enzymes in the tissue with the end result that vast amounts of OPN fragments are generated and released to the circulation. It is not clear, however, how intact OPN produced by other (non-cancerous) tissues becomes fragmented in our patients. On the other hand, there are numerous reports which described the potent biological activities of OPN fragments. This includes the OPN fragments generated by caspase-8, which bear the RGD domain (Fig 1) that was recently shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis [44] . Another OPN fragment which could remotely fit as the candidate antigen in our patients is the 32 kDa C-terminal peptide generated by MMP-3, MMP-7 or MMP-9 (see Fig 1) [45] ; this, again, could be bigger in molecular weight if it becomes glycosylated or phosphorylated. The tumorigenic potential of this fragment is not known but recently, Takafuji et al. [17] found a small OPN fragment (residues 167-210) generated by MMP-9 which seemed able to induce tumor cell invasion via CD44 receptors in hepatocellular carcinoma [46] .",
