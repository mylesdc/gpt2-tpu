As such, certain pairing of viruses may be more clinically relevant than others. Yet, viral-viral interaction is poorly understood.",

In addition, rigorous assessment of eligibility ensured high reliability of the results. All subgroups analyses, with the exception of age subgroups analyses, were defined a priori and post hoc sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the results. Finally a rigorous use of the GRADE approach ensured a transparent and comprehensive approach to evaluate overall quality of the studies. Limitations predominantly relate to the high risk of bias of the included studies. Of note, no studies reported risk estimates adjusted for important prognostic factors such as underlying co-morbidities or bacterial co-infections. Although the influence of comorbid conditions was partially addressed in our subgroup analysis, an insufficient number of studies precluded some subgroup analyses we planned a priori. Respiratory viral infections are known to predispose to secondary bacterial pulmonary infections, and thus can result in substantial confounding [30] . Finally, age subgroup analyses were conducted post hoc. Based on the data available we were able to provide subgroups as defined above, but the data did not allow us to specify other, better discriminating age groups.",

Large, rigorously conducted studies including multivariable analyses adjusting for important confounders are lacking, and thus, new studies would be very likely to significantly change our overall assessment. Prospective longitudinal studies, which will focus on objective outcomes and include serial respiratory sampling for viruses and bacteria may lead to a better understanding of the clinical significance of polymicrobial acute respiratory infections.",

Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate. of the eleven studies had serious design limitations including the absence of notification or adjustment for important prognostic factors and the absence of evidence provided on the similarity of co-interventions between both groups. b Serious Inconsistency: There was high statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 72%, p,0.001), which was not explained on further subgroup analysis.Serious indirectness of the comparison: Only three[33] [19][24] of the eleven studies focused primarily on the comparison of disease severity between single vs viral co-infections. d No serious imprecision: The assumption of our a priori hypothesis of no difference was met. Cumulative sample size was appropriate. The optimal information size to detect a 1-day difference in LOS (alpha 0.05, 90% power) assuming a mean of 4 days (standard deviation 2 days) was 85 subjects per group. The number of subject exceeded this number. The 95% CI interval was narrow and it did not cross the minimally important difference of 1 day although it included the null effect.Serious limitations in design. All the eight studies had serious design limitations including the absence of notification or adjustment for important prognostic factors and the absence of evidence provided on the similarity of co-interventions between both groups. f Moderate inconsistency: There was moderate statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 47%, p = 0.06), which was not explained on further subgroup analysis. g No serious indirectness: Three[21] [15][23] of the eight studies included did not focus primarily on the comparison of disease severity between single vs viral coinfections. h No serious imprecision: Cumulative sample size was appropriate. The 95% CI interval was narrow and included the null effect as predicted in our a priori hypothesis. Serious design limitations: All but one[34] of the seven studies of had very serious design limitations including the absence of notification or adjustment for important prognostic factors and the absence of evidence provided on the similarity of co-interventions between both groups.",
