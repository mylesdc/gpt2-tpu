However, there are no clinically employed agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The present experimental study demonstrated that constitutional flavonoid glycosides derived from herb Epimedium (EF, composed of seven flavonoid compounds with common stem nuclear) exerted dose-dependent effect on inhibition of both thrombosis and lipiddeposition and accordingly reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON in rabbits, which was not via direct action by themselves rather by their common metabolite on potential cellular targets involved in the two pathogenic pathways. The underlying mechanism could be explained by counteracting endothelium injury and excessive adipogenesis. These findings encourage designing clinical trials to investigate potential of EF in prevention of steroid-associated ON.",

Recently, using small scale laboratory isolation procedure, ''Bone Strengthening Herb'' Epimedium derived flavonoids showed beneficial effect on prevention of steroidassociated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition in our established rabbit model with a single dose study design [7, 12] . Now, a simplified procedure for isolating flavonoids from herbal Epimedium to meet requirement of large scale production has been established (International Application Number: PCT/CN2008/000165 issued by World Intellectual Property Organization), which generates seven major flavonoid compounds with common stem nuclear characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile ( Figure 1 ). According to recent findings that diversiform isoflavones with common stem nuclei may be intestinally metabolized to Equal for acting on pharmacological targets [13] , we predicted that all the seven flavonoid glycosides with common stem nuclei in the EF could be finally intestinally metabolized to a uniform molecule detected in serum.",

One hundred and twelve male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits with body weight of 4,5 kg were housed at the Laboratary Animal Service Center of Prince of Wales Hospital, the affiliated hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The animals received a standard laboratory diet and water ad lititum. The experimental protocol was approved by Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of authros' institution in Hong Kong (Ref No. 04/038/MIS). Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON [7] , all the rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 mg. kg 21 of Lippolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. USA) on day 0 (week 0). 24 hours later, three injections of 20 mg. kg 21 of Methylprednisolone (MPS; Pharmacia & Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 hours. Simultaneously, the rabbits were divided into 4 groups for the following daily oral administration: low dose EF group (L-EF; n = 28; 10 mg. kg 21 . day 21 ), middle dose EF group (M-EF; n = 28; 20 mg. kg 21 . day 21 ), high dose EF group (H-EF; n = 28; 40 mg. kg 21 . day 21 ), and control group received corresponding vehicle of EF daily (CON; n = 28). Pre-euthanasia Evaluation. At week 0 (baseline, immediately before LPS injection), 1 and 2 post induction, 5 ml blood sample was collected. Plasma and serum were prepared for evaluating endothelium damage index TM (Thrombomodulin) using established protocols [7, [14] [15] and detection of both prototype and metabolite of EF, respectively. In addition, serum hepatocyte injure indices, including Alanine aminitransperase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were examined for evaluating potential hepatocyte toxicity of EF. Marrow sample from iliac crest was also obtained for local evaluation of adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell (Adipocyte Positvie Colonies) [16] . On the other hand, dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index (PEP, i.e. 'peak enhancement percentage') before sacrifice at baseline, week 1, and week 2 post-induction, using a bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) with our established protocol [7, 12, 16] .",

Marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated by discontinued gradient centrifugation on Ficoll (Density = 1.074 g/ml) at 1050 g for 25 minutes at room temperature. The isolated MNCs were cultured for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in basal medium, containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% mixture of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin (Invitrogen 120 Corporation, Carlsbad, USA), which were incubated at 37uC, 5% humidified CO 2 . After three days, the medium was changed and nonadherent hematopoietic cells were discarded. Afterwards, the medium was changed once a week in two weeks. Two weeks later, the cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm 2 for culture in the basal medium until 80% confluence in one week. Thereafter, the basal medium was repalced with an adipogenic medium (the basal medium supplemented with 15% normal horse serum and 100 nM dexamethasone) (Sigma, Demark) for culture in two weeks [17] . After 2 weeks in culture, the cells in vitro were stained with Oil red O. The colonies cotaining adipocytes that are positive for Oil red O were considered as adipocytic colonies. Percentage of Adipocytic Colonies per Total Colony Number (Adipocyte Positvie Colonies), as adipogenic potential index, was determined microscopically. A colony is defined as a distinct group of more than 16 cells and it represents the derect descedent of 1 MSC present at culture start [18] [19] .",

PEP, as a parameter from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, may reflect 'vascular quantity' for vascular supply. In the present study, the significantly decreased PEP in the CON group at week 1 post-induction indicated insufficient vascular perfusion at an early stage. The results also indicated that EF was able to dose-dependently maintain 'vascular quantity' at an early stage, as evidenced by the findings, i.e. the significantly decreased PEP in the CON group was attenuated in the L-EF group and almost prevented in the H-EF group at week 1 post-induction.",

            "text": "EF mainly consist of seven flavonoid glycosides with common stem nuclear. The question is how does EF exert their effect on cellular target? On one hand, Icaritin as a major intestinal metabolite, in the present study, was detected in the sera of the rabbits treated with EF, whereas those seven flavonoid glycosides were not detected, indicating that those seven flavonoid molecules in EF were intestinally metabolized to Icaritin ( Figure 4F ). This finding was also consistent with recent studies that Icaritin was the primary intestinal metabolite of prenyl flavonoids from Epimedium [29] . On the other hand, our unpublished data demonstrated neither measurable protection effect of EF on endotoxin-induced damage of human umbilical vein endothelial cell, nor measurable inhibition effect of EF on steroid-induced lipid deposition of 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte (data not shown). Further, the in vitro data from human umbilical vein endothelial cell model in the present study showed dose-dependent measurable protection effect of Icaritin on endotoxin-induced damage, which was evidenced by dosedependently lowed supernate soluble TM in the Icaritin groups at three different dosages as compared to the induction group, however, no differences were found between the seven parent flavonoids in EF and the induction group in the supernate soluble TM. In addition, the in vitro data from 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte model in the present study showed dose-dependent measurable inhibition effect of Icaritin on steroid-induced lipid deposition, which was evidenced by dose-dependently lowed oil red O staining in the Icaritin groups at three different dosages as compared to the control group, but no differences were found between the seven flavonoids in EF and the induction group in the oil red O staining. The above two evidences were consistent with the HPLC/UV/ MS/MS findings in study I, suggesting that EF compounds exerted their prevention effects not via direct action by themselves on potential cellular targets. In addition, our recently published animal study further demonstrated that Icaritin, the metabolite of EF, inhibited both thrombosis and lipid-deposition for reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON in a dose-dependent manner, implying that Icaritin might be a bioactive molecule served as common substance basis of those seven flavonoid glycosides with common stem nuclear in EF, though we have no sufficient evidence to conclude that Icaritin found in serum after EF administration was indeed causing the observed prevention effects of EF [16] .",

Glycosidase was thought to be one of the main enzymes to hydrolyze flavonoid glycosides to their corresponding aglycone in the intestinal, and gluconolactone, a broad specificity glycosidase inhibitor, can cause limited hydrolysis of flavonoid glycosides [30] . Thus, gluconolactone could be employed to limit the hydrolysis of EF, and as a result, prevent the formation of Icaritin from EF to see if the EF could reduce incidence of steroidassociated osteonecrosis with the existence of gluconolactone. If the hypothesis would be confirmed it will definitively not only facilitate understanding the basic biological sciences of chemistry metabolism of multi-component EF, but also help further explore molecular mechanism of EF for reducing risk of steroid-associated ON. Furthermore, a novel small molecule Icaritin would emerge into effective prevention of steroid-associated ON.",
