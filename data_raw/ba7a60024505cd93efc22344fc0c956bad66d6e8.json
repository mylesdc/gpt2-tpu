RSA59 induced neuropathology is partially caused by activation of CNS resident microglia, as demonstrated by changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of a microglia/macrophage specific calcium ion binding factor, Iba1. Affymetrix Microarray analysis for mRNA expression data reveals expression of inflammatory mediators that are known to be released by activated microglia. Microglia-specific cell surface molecules, including CD11b, CD74, CD52 and CD68, are significantly upregulated in contrast to CD4, CD8 and CD19. Protein analysis of spinal cord extracts taken from mice 6 days post-inoculation, the time of peak inflammation, reveals robust expression of IFN-c, IL-12 and mKC. Data suggest that activated microglia and inflammatory mediators contribute to a local CNS microenvironment that regulates viral replication and IFN-c production during the acute phase of infection, which in turn can cause phagolysosome maturation and phagocytosis of the myelin sheath, leading to demyelination.",

Acute inflammation comprises the immediate and early response to an injurious agent and is basically a defensive response that paves the way for repair of the damaged site. The term ''neuroinflammation'' is appropriate where limited neuronal insults trigger glial cell activation [1] . Neuroinflammation revolves around direct neuro-glial cell responses (host cell factors) which are induced by infection and injury within the CNS. It also involves the mechanism by which these responses ultimately contribute to neuropathology and neurobiology of diseases.",

This is evident from characteristic changes in microglial cellular morphology and presence of abundant phagocytotic microglia in demyelinating plaques. MHV-induced CNS injury during early stage of infection involves microglia mediated neuroinflammation. But the mechanism by which these inflammatory responses ultimately contribute to MHV-induced demyelination and axonal loss is not clear. To understand neuroinflammatory pathways, expression of host inflammatory genes in MHV-infected mouse spinal cord is evaluated in comparison to non-infected mouse spinal cord by high throughput affymetrix microarray analysis. Brain and liver tissues from infected mice were evaluated for routine histopathological outcomes. Simultaneously, a high throughput Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)) Multi-Array Assay system for Mouse cytokines was performed to determine the predominant neuroinflammatory pathways involved in microglia-mediated myelin destruction.",

            "text": "RSA59 is recombinant isogenic demyelinating (DM) strain of MHV [3, 4] . RSA59 is isogenic to parental MHV-A59 but the spike gene is introduced by targeted RNA recombination. Spike gene encodes an envelope glycoprotein that mediates many biological properties of MHV including viral attachment to host cells, as well as virus-cell and cell-cell fusion [5] . These recombinant strains also express enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) [3] . Briefly, the pMH54 plasmid (obtained from Paul S. Masters) comprises codon 28 of the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) pseudogene through to the 39 end of the MHVA59 genome, including a poly(A) tail, as described by [6] , used as transcription vector to generate RNA for targeted recombination as described previously [7, 8] . In order to replace gene 4 with the EGFP gene, pMH54 was modified by the introduction of a SalI site 42 nucleotides downstream of the intergenic sequence for gene 4a and a NotI site 102 bp upstream of the stop codon for gene 4b, using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Targeted RNA recombination was carried out between synthetic capped RNAs transcribed from pMH54EGFP, using a T7 polymerase transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and fMHV as a recipient virus. Recombinant viruses in which the murine coronavirus spike gene has replaced the feline coronavirus spike gene were selected by replication in murine 17 Cl-1 cells [6, 9] . Candidate recombinants were plaque purified two times, and viral stocks were grown on 17Cl-1 cell for further characterization. For each desired recombinant, at least two viruses derived from independent recombination events were characterized. The EGFP containing viruses with the A59 spike were called RSA59 and used in this study.",

Five mice in each group were infected. Mice were monitored daily for signs of disease. Mock-infected controls were inoculated similarly but with an uninfected cell lysate at a comparable dilution. At day 6 post infection 3 mice were perfused with 40 ml of PBS 1x (treated with DEPC) and whole spinal cord, half of the brain and a piece of liver tissue were harvested for extraction of RNA and stored in RNA later solution at 280uC until extraction. The remaining liver and half brain were post fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for parallel histopathological analysis. Two mice from each group were sacrificed for routine histopathological tissue processing. Two mice in control and three mice in the RSA59 infected group were analyzed in the microarray experiment.

MSD read buffer is added that provides the appropriate chemical environment for electrochemiluminescence. The plate is loaded into an MSD sector instrument for analysis. Inside the sector instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrode which causes the labels bound to the electrode surface to emit light. The instrument measures intensity of emitted light to afford a quantitative measure of the antibodies.

Affymetrix gene chip array analysis of spinal cord RNA reveals differential expression of 822 genes in RSA59-infected mice using a 1.5-fold cut off for changes in expression and a P value #0.05 (Figure1A) as compared to control mice. Volcano plot of genes expressed in two control and two infected mice reveals that out of these 822 genes, 681 genes were upregulated and 141 genes were down regulated in infected mice. Using a 2-fold cut for significant changes in transcript expression with respect to control, 493 genes were upregulated and only 41 genes were down regulated (data not shown). For remaining studies, we only analyzed the 1.5-fold cut off data. Affymetrix Expression Console Software was used to identify specific upregulated and down regulated ( Figure 1B ) genes. The down regulated genes mostly belong to non-coding regions of the mouse genome. The 681 genes upregulated in RSA59 infected spinal cords include numerous genes involved in innate immune inflammation, and can be clustered into groups based on their function (Figure1C).

Very few cells in the vicinity of the inflamed regions are CD4+, CD8+ or CD19+ (data not shown) as seen in previous studies [10, 15] . Data is consistent with mRNA expression by RT-PCR showing a 4-to 5-fold upregulation of the Aif1 gene which encodes Iba-1 protein ( Figure 5C ).",

Analysis of acute inflamed brain and spinal cord tissue from RSA59-infected mice reveals robust IFN-c, IL-12, IL-10 and mKC protein expression ( Figure 6 ). Data corroborates microarray data, showing upregulation of innate immune related proteins mainly involved in antiviral immune responses and phagolysosome maturation, such as IFN-c and IL-12, which stimulates IFN-c secretion. mKC is produced by activated microglia/macrophages and plays an important role in inflammation. IL-10 is also upregulated, and is a potent suppressor of monocyte/macrophage function in secretion of TH1 cytokines, and helps virus evade the immune system. Results are consistent with prior evidence that a Th1-biased cytokine/chemokine response accompanies persistent MHV infection when antigen presentation is ongoing [16] .",

Previously, it was shown that that RAG1-/-mice on B6 background infected with RSA59 develop fatal disease but not WT B6 mice, which supports the importance of adaptive immune response in this disease [17] . But the fatal disease of RSA59 in RAG1-/-mice may also be due to hypersensitivity. Moreover, there is evidence that MHV-A59 (Parental wild type strain of RSA59) can induce demyelination in the absence of T and B cells in RAG1-/-mice [18] . Taken together with our current findings, one possible explanation is that RSA59 may induce virus specific CD4 and CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i., but at earlier days (day 3 through 6); the majority of the inflammatory cells are microglia. Direct virus induced neuroinflammation due to the activation of CNS resident microglia may induce virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses in the CNS which may play a role in the augmentation of inflammation. Therefore, our studies mainly found changes in genes which are known to code microglia/ macrophage specific cell surface molecules and other features of the innate response, often felt to occur even earlier in acute viral infection.",

It is well known that Type I interferons (IFN-a/b) provide a first line of defense against viral infections by limiting dissemination prior to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. Viral infection is sensed by endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which signal to activate NF-kB, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and downstream transcription of cytokine and IFN-a/b genes [19, 20] . Previous studies demonstrated that IFN-a/b binding to its receptor induces JAK/STAT signaling and upregulation of hundreds of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) in infected and uninfected cells. The antiviral effector functions triggered by IFN-a/b during a virus infection involve the concerted action of ISGs. In addition to direct innate antiviral factors, ISGs comprise cytokines, chemokines, and molecules associated with antigen presentation (MHC class I), thereby shaping adaptive immune responses [21] . The classically studied ISGs, RNase L, PKR, and Mx1, disrupt viral replication and subsequently spread by interfering with both viral and host cell transcription and translation [22] . However, the susceptibility to innate antiviral effector mechanisms differs between viruses and may also be distinct between target organs as well as cell types and their differentiation state [23, 24] has been reported.",

HIV-1 enters the CNS early after infection, whereas productive replication and macrophage invasion occur years later [42] . Infected microglia harbor viral particles intracellularly, reflecting their potential as a reservoir. It has become increasingly apparent that HIV-1-infected microglia actively secrete both endogenous neurotoxins (TNF-a, IL-1a, CXCL8/IL-8, glutamate, quinolinic acid, platelet-activating factor, eicosanoids, and nitric oxide) as well as neurotoxic viral proteins (Tat, gp120, and gp41). In addition to neurotoxicity, these viral proteins can also affect microglial cell proliferation [42] . In Cytomegalovirus infection (HCMV), key defence cells include microglia and T lymphocytes. In mouse models, antiviral cytokine TNF-a is produced by the microglial cells and sometimes T lymphocytes, mainly when they are chemoattracted by CXCL10. In HSV infection, neuroinflammation is characterized by acute focal necrotizing encephalitis. Microglial cells express both MHC class I and class II molecules and produce soluble mediators TNFa, IL-1a, CXCL10, CCL5, IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL3 [42] .",

            "text": "Protein expression data corroborates microarray data, including an upregulation of specific Th1 immune related proteins. Many of these proteins are mainly involved in antiviral immune responses and phagolysosome maturation, and their upregulation also suggests acute MHV infection can drive innate and conserved antiviral responses similar to those seen in other viral infections. Similar phenomena have been observed in HIV infection in monocytes/microglia [44] . In contrast to Th1 responses, current results show almost no upregulation of Th2 cytokines/chemokines. The combination of increased expression of several canonical Th1 cytokines/chemokines and absence of Th2 cytokines/chemokines in RSA59 infected tissues supports the hypothesis that the host is continuing to mount a cell-mediated immune response to RSA59, as previously suggested [45] . Moreover, our data suggest that activated microglia/macrophage and inflammatory mediators contribute to a local CNS microenvironment that regulates viral replication and IFN-c production during the acute phase of infection. The potential role of IFN-c despite the limited role of T cells is intriguing, as initially it was believed that CD4+ T helper cell type 1 (Th1) lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, and NK cells exclusively produced IFN-c [46, 47] . However, there is now evidence that other cells, such as B cells, NKT cells, and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [monocyte/macrophage, dendritic cells (DCs)] secrete IFN-c [48, 49, 50, 51] . IFN-c production by monocyte/macrophage, DCs acting locally may be important in self-activation and activation of nearby cells [50, 51] . While IFN c is produced in T cells, its upregulation has also occurred in T cell deficient nude mice, leading to the conclusion that macrophages can also play a role in this in vivo response of IFN-c secretion [52, 53] , and during viral infections, macrophages are among the first cells in any organ to be exposed and are likely the major producers of IFN-c soon after infection. IFN-c can further self-activate microglia, promoting phagolysome maturation and phagocytosis of the myelin sheath, which may partially explain how demyelination, which starts as early as day 5 post-inoculation and reaches its peak around day 30 [54] , occurs. Previous ultrastructural studies [10] support this mechanism as well, revealing activated microglia can surround myelinated axons with the myelin sheath getting disrupted with intact axons. Therefore, one mechanism of demyelination involves macrophage-mediated myelin stripping through an autophagy pathway without involving conventional CD4+ and CD8+T cells. Figure S1 Representative histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis of RSA59-and mock-infected mouse brain and liver. Brain tissue from the infected mice whose spinal cord tissues were processed for affymetrix microarray analysis was processed for routine histological and immunohistochemical analysis. A, C, E and G sections are from mock-infected mouse; B, D, F and H are from representative image of RSA59 infected mouse; A-B: liver tissues stained with H & E show severe hepatitis in RSA59 infected mice (B) and no hepatitis lesions in control mice (A). Sagittal brain sections stained with H& E (C, D), immunostained with anti-Iba-1 (E, F), and with anti-nucleocapsid antibody (G-H). RSA59 infected mice show encephalitis (D), diffused staining of Iba-1 (F) and wide spread distribution of viral antigen (H). Representative section from one infected mice were shown here. In control mock infected mice there were no encephalitis was observed (C), resting ramified microglia was observed in E and there were no viral antigen staining as expected (G). I: Relative mRNA expression of viral nucleocapsid gene from two RSA59-(DM) infected mouse spinal cords at day 6 post-infection compared to two control mock-infected mouse spinal cords. Yaxis represents the relative expression of viral nucleocapsid gene of infected and control mice spinal cord and X-axis represents individual mouse from control and infected group.

Classification of differential expressed genes in the spinal cord between control and RSA59 infected mice. . Mouse multiplex array cytokine assay was performed on protein extracts from acute inflamed (day 6 post-infection) brain and spinal cord tissues from RSA59-infected and mock-infected mice. Expression levels of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines reveals upregulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses, including IFN-c, IL-12, IL-10 and mKC, similar to gene expression data.
