Partly exacerbated by the initial unavailability of cryo-cooling techniques, and tight control of water content in crystals prior or during data collection, dehydration has always been of paramount importance. In the early days, when most data were collected at room temperature, it was necessary to maintain the stability of samples for hours or even days (Pickford et al. 1993 ). This meant that researchers were more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of hydration control and accustomed to accounting for the role it played in their observed results. Dehydration has been reported to be beneficial on the diffraction quality of macromolecular crystals (Heras and Martin 2005; Newman 2006 ; Russo et al. 2012) . In most cases the discovery has occurred as a result of casual observations (such cracked capillaries, drops left to dry, badly sealed trays and others) (Esnouf et al. 1998; Abergel 2004) .",

Once crystal samples are cooled, most of the alterations are prevented, so the need for careful control of humidity is diminished and shifted from the data collection stage to the pre-cooling sample preparation step (Farley et al. 2014; Pflugrath 2015) . Crystal handling can have a significant effect on the hydration state of samples and, as it has been highlighted recently, it can have potential consequences in the structural solution (Farley et al. 2014) . Therefore, crystallographers have a number of techniques and \"tricks\" in order to prevent these effects with greater or lesser success. Chemically, the cryo-protection process also causes alterations in osmotic pressure in the crystal samples, similar to a hydration/dehydration process, thus it can change the structure and packing, often leading to changes in diffraction quality (Heras and Martin 2005) .",

Here we consider crystal dehydration as any process able to remove available water molecules from the crystals lattice. Dehydration is achieved by either altering the vapour (Sect. 6.2.1) or the chemical (Sect. 6.2.2) equilibrium of the crystal. These two methods of dehydration are different but also interrelated as the chemical alterations can be used to induce a change in the vapour environment and, the changes in the vapour surrounding the sample can induce alterations the chemistry. The relative amount of water present in a volume of air, Relative Humidity (RH), is directly linked to the temperature and chemical nature of a solution in equilibrium with the air. For this reason, salt solutions are universal calibrating standards for any equipment designed to measure air RH (Greenspan 1977) . When dehydrating crystals, it is advisable to try methods based on both approaches. In some cases, both methods can lead to very similar results but in others (particularly membrane protein crystals with detergents) the outcome of the process can be dependent on the particular technique used.",

From a practical point of view, the researcher either replaces the solution surrounding the crystals samples via careful pipetting or dialysis, or physically transfers the crystals into a new solution. This is the most frequent way of undertaking dehydration and it is often done in combination with cryo-protection or ligand binding.

            "text": "Key in dehydration experiments is the concept of Relative Humidity (RH). Relative Humidity is defined as the relative amount of water vapour in a given volume of air. It is expressed as a percentage of the saturation humidity and is pressure-and temperature-dependent (Winston and Bates 1960) . As the chemical composition of a solution alters the saturation vapour pressure, it can be used to cross calibrate both the vapour and chemical dehydration experiments. For example at 20 \u0131 C a saturated solution of LiCl is tabulated to be around 11 % RH, NaCl 75 % RH, KCl 86 % RH, and K 2 SO 4 97 % RH (see Table 6 .1 (Bowler et al. 2015; Wheeler et al. 2012) . It is also important to remember that an individual crystallisation droplet will be in equilibrium with the well solution, but during the course of the crystallisation experiment the well might have dried up over time, thus it is much better to measure the empirical value of each tray before commencing an experiment. In general, macromolecules tend to crystallise in highly hydrated solutions that require high RH to be stable but lack \"cryo-protective\" properties. Cryo solutions prevent ice formation by hydrogen bonding to the surrounding water molecules. These bonds also reduce the available water surrounding the crystal structure leading to a desiccation process. The empirical test of several precipitants commonly used in protein crystallisation clearly shows a correlation between the ability to cryo-protect and lower Relative Humidity (Wheeler et al. 2012 ). This highlights the intimate link between both effects (dehydration and cryo-protection) on crystal diffraction quality, however, it is difficult to understand the contribution from each of them when assessing diffraction quality collected at cryo-temperatures. Despite the key role dehydration may play in structure determination, researchers often do not carry out systematic studies on the effect it could have on the data quality, thus overlooking the role it might have played in their success or failure.",

Dehydration prior to cryocooling in many cases helps to overcome the issues mentioned above as the pre-contraction induced by the dehydration process can yield a better lattice re-arrangement for the cryo-cooling. In other cases, dehydration is also beneficial as it can act as a way of cryo-protection .

Crystals grown by the Lipid Cubic Phase (LCP) method (Caffrey 2003) tend to be formed by proteins organised in planar layers through proteindetergent-lipid hydrophobic interactions stacked on top of each other by polar interactions. These crystals are extremely small and fragile two dimensional plates known as type I 3D crystals. These crystals are difficult to harvest, difficult to see and most of their properties are intimately linked to the biochemical properties of the LCP. As the LCP structure is temperature and humidity dependent, this type of crystal is very unlikely to be useful for controlled dehydrations studies. On the other hand, membrane protein crystals can also grow using more \"standard\" crystallisation methods such vapour diffusion leading to crystals organised in a more three dimensional fashion (type II 3D crystals) similar to soluble proteins and more suited for dehydration experiments. Despite their similarity with soluble crystals, these membrane protein crystals tend to have lower protein content (10-25 % rather than 45-60 %) and higher solvent content (mainly water in soluble proteins) made up of detergents/lipids free micelles. Integrity and dynamics of membrane proteins are closely related to the properties of the surrounding phospholipids in the native membrane. To avoid protein aggregation once removed from its natural environment, detergent is used in the protein solution in order to mimic the lipid membrane by surrounding the hydrophobic region of the protein generating a water-soluble protein-detergent complex (PDC). Therefore, membrane protein crystals formation and stability are strongly linked to the protein overall molecular structure (hydrophilic and hydrophobic exposed regions) and to the size, concentration and critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the detergent. While some membrane protein crystals are able to tolerate an increase or decrease of detergent once they have been formed others are more sensitive and lose their order if the equilibrium (bound detergent/free detergent) is changed. This will have a strong impact on the crystal dehydration ability. More information in the use of detergents in membrane protein structure determination can be found in Chap. 2 of this book.",

In soluble protein crystals, a small change in the global solvent content will cause a huge change in the whole crystal structure therefore these crystals usually require less dehydration. In membrane protein crystals, most of the alterations are targeted at the small solvent rich areas scattered around the lattice, and in order to remove enough water to successfully induce a change on the whole structure, the extent of dehydration needed is often much greater than for soluble proteins. The less amount of water in the lattice, the stronger the process needs to be to extract it. A good example of this are the crystals of the bile acid sodium symporter ASBT (Hu et al. 2011 ) that have required dehydration from an initial RH of 95 % down to 45 % in order to improve diffraction limit from around 8 \u00c5 at room temperature to around 2 \u00c5 after cryocooling.",

On the contrary, dehydration methods that are performed on wet samples surrounded by their mother liquor (see Sect. 6.3.1) affect the whole drop.

It is mainly responsible for the \"I am getting better at harvesting crystals\" syndrome, as with time, crystallographers either start harvesting faster (allowing for less dehydration in delicate samples) or they harvest numerous samples from an individual drop (allowing for the last ones to dehydrate more). It can also be induced during the final harvesting prior cryocooling by allowing the sample to dehydrate on the loop before the final plunge in liquid nitrogen.

It is, for obvious reasons, only possible in vapour diffusion crystallisation samples and relies on using the same crystallisation drop for the actual experiment. The idea is to replace the well solution with increased amounts of a desiccating solution (Fig. 6.2b) . The new solution will lower the water vapour pressure and in return \"pull\" water out of the crystallisation drop inducing a change in the crystals. This is normally undertaken by using some of the standard saturated calibration salt solutions but can also be done using crystallisation precipitants. Depending on the volumes available, dehydration can be achieved by simple addition of salts to the pre-existing well buffer or by replacing the well with a totally new solution. Dehydration is a slow and gradual process most of the time, which depends on the drop size and well volume. It can be undertaken in one single step or in progressive steps and normally, after a period of equilibration (normally between 8 and 24 h), samples are harvested and stored for data collection. The most attractive feature of this dehydration method is its simplicity and easy implementation. It can be undertaken whenever samples are available and once the optimal conditions are found it is very easy to reproduce. It can be achieved at any temperature and in general the presence of highly volatile compounds in the crystallisation solutions is not a concern.",

The main difference between this and the previous method described (Sect. 6.3.1.2) is that here it is possible to change the chemical components of the crystallisation drop and not only the concentration of the pre-existing ones. This procedure opens the possibility that the chemical used for dehydration alters the structure and/or the resulting diffraction by chemical modification rather than dehydration. In addition, the rate of exchange is more difficult to control and normally carried out by slow diffusion of buffers with increased concentration. If crystallisation droplets are very small, it is easy to cause a shock on the crystals, therefore premixing solutions to the target concentration can sometimes help. The simplest way of chemical dehydrating is by dialysis. This only requires replacing the solutions and, due to the dialysis membrane, it is very gentle and controllable.",

In addition, the cryo-cooling process undertaken after the dehydration procedure can muddle results. This was noted early on in the use of macromolecular crystallography and initial attempts were made by developing tools that would couple salt-based vapour dehydration to the, then available, data collection using the capillary (glass or quartz) mounting method (Huxley and Kendrew 1953; Pickford et al.1993; Kiefersauer et al. 2000a, b) . For a time, this proved to be useful (Rockland 1960; Dobrianov et al. 2001 ) but fell into disuse due to the high X-ray scatter background produced compared to loops. The technique was re-introduced a few years later (Mac Sweeney and D'Arcy 2003; Basavappa et al. 2003 ) by adapting new lower background capillaries (made of a transparent polymer) to the then standard pinbased mounts Hellert et al. 2014) (Fig. 6.3a,d) . The later method is cheap, easy to implement and very popular amongst researchers attempting to dehydrate whilst collecting X-ray data in-house and for simple cryo-cooling (Yao et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2007 ). As the mounts (MicroRT system -MiTeGen) are standard, the technique is also available at any synchrotron beamline where manual mounting is possible.

            "text": "The humidity control dehydration device (HC1) was developed a few years after the FMS in order to address the factors limiting the wider use of this method by the community (Sanchez-Weatherby et al. 2009; Russi et al. 2011 ). The HC1 key difference is that, despite also being based on dew point, the delivery of humid airflow is achieved via a nozzle rather than a cooling block ( Fig. 6.3c,f) . The HC1 nozzle makes it unable to alter the temperature of the air around the sample but makes it very easy to install and use it in a standard academic laboratory with a home X-ray source or any MX synchrotron beamline. The low complexity of the device reduced the cost and simplified its maintenance making it better received by many academic laboratories and a large number of synchrotron beamlines around the world. To date nine devices are available at several world synchrotrons. The ESRF/EMBL/ILL operate two devices available across the MX beamlines. The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (Mueller et al. 2012) and Max IV Laboratory (Ursby et al. 2013 ) operate the device installed in one of their MX branches. In the US, both APS (NE-CAT 24-ID-E) and the ALS (Berkeley Center for Structural Biology beamlines) have one each, the Canadian Light Source (Fodje et al. 2014 ) has one and Diamond Light Source in the UK has another two that can be both installed in any of the MX beamlines and also in a laboratory as an off-line setup. Considerable efforts have been made at several of the synchrotrons in order to incorporate the HC1 within their hardware and software. For example, workflows within MxCuBE (Gabadinho et al. 2010) have been adapted to undertake dehydration experiments (Brockhauser et al. 2012) and the Diamond beamline software (GDA) now includes a bespoke data collection perspective solely dedicated at undertaking these sorts of experiments. This allows synchrotron users to be able to undertake a range of dehydration experiments as part of their normal beamtime allocation. In some synchrotron facilities (BM14 at the ESRF and I02, I03 and I04 at Diamond), installations also include rapid swapping between the use of the HC1 and the standard cryo-temperature allowing constant routine use without the local beamline support. Others (like MaxLab and BESSY) have opted for a more permanent installation (Mueller et al. 2012; Ursby et al. 2013) .",

Once the optimum humidity has been determined, crystal samples can be mounted using micromeshes (MiTeGen) so that any excess buffer can be removed by wicking.

            "text": "In most of the MX beamlines across the world, sample environments (also called experimental hutches) have been made more automationfriendly. Consequently, the space available for additional and special setups became more restrictive. Despite this, due to the developments of photon counting pixel array detectors and their potential to help outrun radiation damage (Kraft et al. 2009; Aishima et al. 2010; Rajendran et al. 2011) there have been a number of technical upgrades to allow data collection of room temperature samples within these crowded spaces. These include new crystallisation plates (with lower profile and better geometry), upgraded goniometry, dedicated robotics and imaging systems, make room temperature data collection possible. The option of collecting data directly from crystallisation plates without the need of any physical manipulation of the crystals brings new links between the experiment in the laboratory and the X-ray source. Essentially, in this method, crystals from the same crystallisation condition are grown in a full 96-well crystallisation plate (always advisable to use crystallisation plates with flat bottoms to avoid visual artefacts when mounted at the beamline). Once crystals are grown, gradients of different dehydration solutions are added to the plate wells through small pierces (without touching the crystal drops) and re-sealed (see Fig. 6 .4). The dehydration is allowed to proceed for a period of 8-12 h before the plate be taken to an X-ray source with capabilities for in situ plate screening (Douangamath et al. 2013; Moraes and Archer 2015; Axford et al. 2015) . This method is essentially a vapour control, by exchanging well solutions, which allows multiple samples to be dehydrated in a number of ways in one single procedure. With high throughput tools it is possible, with a reasonable amount of beam time, to analyse these complex dehydration results without the blurring effect of cryo-cooling. In summary, the fundamental advantages of using in situ is that there is no need for direct crystal handling and therefore small or delicate samples are not a problem, crystals can grow at 4 \u0131 C with the procedure carrying on at the same temperature and there is no need for cryo-cooling.",

The researcher's choice will depend on a number of constraints such sample, resources and time availability (see Table 6 .4). Also depending on the method used the outcomes will vary. In certain occasions, observations will be immeasurable due to crystal cracking, shrinking or dissolving, in others observations will be easy to measure (lattice dimensions, mosaicity and resolution limits) and unfortunately, in others negative results will be the outcome (lack of diffraction, presence of ice rings or non indexable lattices). For these reasons it is advisable to correlate all the different information available and try to make sense of partial data. All the different types of dehydration experiments can be linked via their relation to Relative Humidity. By using available tabulated information (salt dehydration) or measuring empirical humidity (HC1/FMS) researchers can correlate results from different experiments. The idea is to try to extract as much information and try new experiments that may lead to a positive outcome with the available tools. For example, prior to any dehydration attempt, most researchers have already tried standard cryo-cooling, soaks and handled their crystals in a number of ways. Researchers are familiar with crystals stability under the microscope and their methods for soaking in cryo-protectant are useful when planning dehydration protocols either using the HC1/FMS or a vapour diffusion experiment. Similarly, measuring or calculating the equilibrium RH of these solutions can give to the crystallographer clues of why some of the solutions are better than others and suggest new cooling protocols. Often, cryo diffraction data is also available and so a quick comparison with room temperature data collection can possibly yield fruitful clues. Variable indexing in cryo lattices can be an indication of a varied initial crystal population suggesting a variable response to cryo making crystals interesting candidates for dehydration. A review of old crystal forms observed during past experiments (despite not diffracting well) can also give useful clues to plan dehydration experiments. During dehydration, the observation of lattice transitions, minimum lattices and points of loss of diffraction can be used later when defining starting points for cryo-cooling methods. Even dehydration itself can be used as a simple cryo-protecting strategy useful in preventing adverse effects of penetrative cryo-protectant ). Using Relative Humidity as a way of cross-referencing results from the different experiments allows decisions to be made on quantitative measurements and permits experiment planning that will yield easier to compare results.",

In addition, as these crystals have larger solvent channels, often require greater dehydration than required for soluble proteins.
