The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics.",

Advances in molecular techniques, have led to an increased detection rate for respiratory viruses, suggesting that the frequency of non-bacterial RTIs was previously underestimated. In CT, or MRI. Pharyngeal swabs obtained from these patients were transported in viral media at 4\u00b0C to the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and were tested either immediately or after being stored at -80\u00b0C for no more than 72 hours.

The rate of doctor visits was particularly low in January, February, September and October (Fig 2A). However, the total PDR of the pathogens during these months was not significantly different from that in the other months. The 18 pathogens were detected as follows, in decreasing order of PDR: IAV, RSV, MP, and HCoV (the order of the PDRs of the four HCoV types was OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1), all of which had PDRs greater than 5%, followed by ADV, HRV, IBV, EV, PIV (the order of the four PIV types was PIV3, PIV1, PIV2, PIV4), HMPV, HBoV, and CP (Fig 2B and 2D ). During the 5-year period of the study (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) , the individual PDRs of the 18 pathogens exhibited four distinct trends (Fig 2C and 2D ): (1) One peak in PDR was observed for IAV (which had a peak in 2009 mainly driven by an outbreak), HBoV, HRV, ADV, CP, HCoV, EV, and PIV. Among these pathogens, a peak-valley trend was observed for IAV, HBoV, and HRV (first tested for on July 1 st , 2011); a valley-peak trend was observed for ADV, CP, and HCoV (OC43 and 229E); and a valley-peak-valley trend was observed for EV, HCoV (NL63), and PIV2. (2) Two peaks in PDR were observed for HMPV, RSV, and MP. (3) Three peaks in PDR were observed for IBV. (4) No peaks in PDR were observed for HKU1 and PIV4.",

Among the pathogens tested, IAV, RSV, MP, and HCoV were detected with PDRs greater than 5%. These results are consistent with the high prevalence of these viruses, especially IAV and RSV, which remain the greatest threats to the human respiratory system [14] . Additionally RSV, MP, HBoV, HRV and ADV exhibited increasing incidences in children over the course of the study. During the same period, in some developed countries such as the USA, European countries, RSV, influenza and HMPV became completely undetectable. HRV has been reported to be one of the main pathogens causing upper RTIs, with a PDR as high as 10-30% [15] . This finding is inconsistent with our research, which observed the PDR of HRV to be less than 5%, indicating it is not a common pathogen in RTIs. This difference may be due to two factors. First, we tested pharyngeal swabs but not nasal swabs. Second, HRV causes common upper RTIs, which often present with symptoms too mild to lead to doctor visits or hospitalizations. RTIs are the most common disease observed in humans and are especially prevalent in pediatric and immunocompromised populations [14] . On a related note, different behavioral habits, environments, and degrees of immunity are experienced at different ages [16] . In addition, because the half-lives of antibodies that recognize different pathogens vary [17, 18] , there are differences in disease incidence and severity according to age. Studies [19, 20] have shown that approximately 100% of 6-year old children have been infected with one or more respiratory pathogens; however, these infections do not result in effective long-term immunity, so children can be repeatedly infected by the same viruses. The results of the present study suggested that among adults, attention should be focused on IAV, IBV, HCoV, and HRV infections, whereas in pediatric patients, RSV, MP, IAV, OC43 and ADV infections should receive the most attention. Moreover, IAV, MP, and OC43 infections should be closely monitored by clinical detection throughout childhood, and RSV and ADV infections should be monitored in preschool and school-aged children, respectively.",

In the current study, the season affected the total PDR, which increased from winter to spring to summer and reached a peak in autumn. The fact that the PDR of the RTIs was higher in summer and autumn is in contrast with the seasonal incidence of RTIs. This seasonal trend is likely due to a more hospitable environment for the viruses, the artificial selection of susceptible human populations, and the method of transmission of the pathogens [21] . Consistent with previous studies, our results found that most pathogens exhibited obvious seasonal epidemic peaks each year. However, IBV, HBoV, HKU1, PIV4, pediatric EV, and adult CP did not show annual seasonal peaks. Surprisingly, the PDR of pediatric EV increased each year until a peak was reached and then an annual decrease in PDR occurred. The reason for this trend is not clear. While the PDR of RSV was highest in spring, the PDRs of the common pathogens IAV, MP, HCoV, EV, and ADV were highest in autumn. Based on these results, the detection of viruses that cause RTIs should be targeted based on the season.",

            "text": "Clinically, respiratory pathogens play an important role in chronic lung disease patients and in immunocompromised patients [22] [23] [24] . RTIs can be particularly exacerbated in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with cancer, blood diseases, or an organ transplant, which can result in patient mortality [25] [26] [27] . Previous reports have shown that approximately 25-45% of immunocompromised patients die due to an RTI [25] . Novel molecular techniques have enabled the identification of new viruses, such as HMPV, HCoV, HBoV, and HRV, as causative agents of RTIs. A pathogen PDR greater than 5% suggests that the pathogen is common in a disease group, and when a disease group experiences a PDR higher than that in other disease groups, the disease group is particularly vulnerable to the pathogen. In the present study, different disease groups had distinct common pathogens and were vulnerable to different pathogens. RTIs are most often co-infections caused by multiple viruses, multiple bacteria, or a combination of viruses and bacteria [28] [29] [30] . These pathogens can interact with each other, resulting in more severe symptoms [31] [32] [33] [34] . Although some research [35] [36] [37] showed that the CIR ranged from 10% to 46% in pediatric patients, the samples used for detection, population studied and time factors were different in those studies than in the present study. In the current study, common pathogens associated with co-infections were HCoV, HBoV, EV, and PIV. Previous studies have shown that HCoV co-infection does not result in more severe disease [38] . Alternatively, pathogens that co-infected patients positive for HBoV have been reported [19, 39, 40] to cause clinical symptoms ranging from negligible to severe, and coinfection with EV and PIV is often accompanied by severe symptoms that involve other body systems [41, 42] . Immunocompromised patients in particular are susceptible to the four most common co-infectious pathogens. Therefore, immunocompromised populations should be targeted by RTI prevention strategies. Additionally, the highest CIRs were observed in the < 7 year and 14 year old subgroups in the present study, and the CIRs of the pathogens, except RSV were higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients. The reasons for these findings must be determined by future studies.",

            "text": "Our research represents a large epidemiologic study of RTIs. As mentioned in our previous article [11] , bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the site of infection is the best sample for testing for a lower RTI. However, because harvesting BALF is rarely carried out, especially in ill children, we analyzed the characteristics of pathogens from pharyngeal swab samples. Outpatients often have symptoms that are too mild to allow for pathogen detection from such samples, so we chose to use inpatients for this research. In addition, according to the manufacturer's data, the sensitivities of the detection kits used were as follows: 1000 copies/ml including: influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), four types of parainfluenza (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus (EV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), four strains of human coronavirus (HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1). And 500 copies/ml including: adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (HBoV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and human rhinovirus (HRV). In summary, based on the pathogen distributions and epidemic tendencies, our results showed that IAV remains the most common RTI pathogen, as IAV exhibits a strong propensity for pathogenic mutations, increased awareness regarding IAV is warranted. Overall, summer and autumn appear to be the key periods for RTI-associated viral pathogen prevention and surveillance. Notably, spring is the most important time for the specific prevention of RSV, and EV should be monitored in pediatric patients year-round. More importantly, pathogens such as RSV, ADV, HCoV, HRV, and CP have exhibited increasing incidences in recent years, which suggests the need to strengthen prevention and monitoring measures, especially for severe pathogens such as RSV. Our results also suggest that children require different preventative measures than adults due to differences in pathogen susceptibility. In RTI patients with severe extra pulmonary symptoms, viral pathogens are most likely the cause of the RTI. The populations most susceptible to co-infection include school-aged male children, patients with chronic lung disease, and immunodeficient individuals, and the pathogens most commonly involved in co-infections are HCoV, HBoV, EV, and PIV. In conclusion, despite the complexity of RTIs, the clinical and epidemiological signatures of the disease can provide important clues to aid clinicians in optimizing diagnostic and treatment plans and to enable the generation of reasonable public health strategies. In addition, vaccines and new drug treatments are urgently needed.",
