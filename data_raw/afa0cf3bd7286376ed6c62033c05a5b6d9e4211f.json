We examined a broad range of carrying capacities, finding that the estimation of pathogen invasion probability was insensitive to changes in carrying capacity. The value of b 1 in the main text corresponds to a carrying capacity of 640 individuals L \u22121 , which was the maximum density we examined in our experimental infection trials. However, as we demonstrate here, our findings are robust to other values of b 1 . This is not surprising, as the focus is on the transient period after pathogen exposure, such that carrying capacity does not play a large role in pathogen invasion. ",

Further, this would result in a non-monotonic relationship between host density and the pathogen invasion threshold, as a result of suppressed host feeding at high host densities resulting in reduced pathogen transmission. We did not find support for an upper host density threshold to pathogen invasion ( Figure A4 inset) . On the other hand, epidemic size and max infection prevalence declined in the highest host density treatment, suggesting that epidemics weren't as severe when host density was extremely high. This suggests that dense host populations may experience smaller overall epidemics, but casts doubt on the existence of an upper host density threshold to pathogen invasion. ",
