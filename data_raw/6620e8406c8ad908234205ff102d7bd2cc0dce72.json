H. parasuis isolates display a wide range of virulence and virulence factors are largely unknown. Commercial bacterins are often used to vaccinate swine against H. parasuis, though strain variability and lack of cross-reactivity can make this an ineffective means of protection. Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and OMV are often enriched in toxins, signaling molecules and other bacterial components. Examination of OMV structures has led to identification of virulence factors in a number of bacteria and they have been successfully used as subunit vaccines. We have isolated OMV from both virulent and avirulent strains of H. parasuis, have examined their protein content and assessed their ability to induce an immune response in the host. Vaccination with purified OMV derived from the virulent H. parasuis Nagasaki strain provided protection against challenge with a lethal dose of the bacteria.",

Protection has been achieved with the use of formalin-inactivated bacterins [9, 10] , though heterologous cross-protection against strains from a different serotype can be variable and highly dependent on the vaccine and challenge strains utilized [11, 12] . Vaccination with other members of the Pasteurellaceae family, as well as attenuated H. parasuis strains, can offer some cross-protection against virulent strains [6, 7, 13] . Subunit vaccines composed of bacterial ghosts, DNA, transferrin and other Haemophilus proteins have been evaluated, with the efficacy of the vaccines varying [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

A polysaccharide capsule involved in resistance to phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing has been reported [19, 20] . The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of H. parasuis is involved in induction of apoptosis, adhesion to certain host cells, and resistance to complement mediated killing [21] . Some strains have been shown to produce cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) which contribute to serum resistance, as well as host cell adhesion and invasion [22] . The virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters (VTAs), a family of adhesin proteins, have also been found in Haemophilus, and a role in delaying phagocytosis has been shown [23, 24] . Two outer membrane porin proteins, OmpP2 and OmpP5, have been identified as potential virulence factors, but a direct role in pathogenesis has yet to be characterized [25] . Additional proteins potentially involved in virulence have been identified, though not completely characterized, including a neuraminidase, IgA protease, and fimbriae [26, 27] . The presence or absence of many of these factors, however, does not always indicate virulence in this organism.",

Enriched in virulence factors, signaling molecules and other bacterial components, OMV structures have been isolated from numerous bacteria, their content determined and their role in pathogenesis examined [29, 30] . Multiple functional roles have been proposed for OMV, including secretion of virulence factors, bacterial envelope stress relief, inter-and intracellular communication, gene transfer, biofilm formation and host immune modulation [31, 32] . OMV are capable of delivering their content to host cells, through fusion with the plasma membrane or uptake via endocytic routes [33, 34] . Examination of the host immune response to OMV shows that they are capable of altering production of cytokines, regulating cell-surface molecules and triggering apoptosis [35] [36] [37] [38] . Researchers have explored the use of OMV as vaccines against both human and animal pathogens, demonstrating their ability to provide protection against challenge with the parental strain from which they are derived [39] [40] [41] [42] . No previous studies of OMV production by H. parasuis have been reported, though examination of OMV produced by the related human pathogen H. influenza has led to identification of virulence factors, potential mechanisms for diversion of the host immune response and use as a potential vaccine [35, 40, 43, 44] .",

A number of standard techniques were utilized to accomplish this goal, as experiments of this nature have been successfully applied to a number of other bacteria, though never Haemophilus parasuis. Determining the proper growth conditions under which to isolate OMV was the beginning of this process, as media and method of cultivation can have an extreme effect on protein content and yield of OMV. Examining the effect of the purified OMV on host cells, as measured by RT-PCR and cytotoxicity assays, determined the potential host response to a vaccine composed of these structures. Comparison of the protein content between the avirulent and virulent strains identifies potential virulence factors that may be packaged into OMV. The final test was an animal study to examine whether these structures protect the host from infection with Haemophilus parasuis.",

The final supernatant was passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter unit (Nalgene) to remove intact H. parasuis cells. Bacterial pellets were subsequently processed to generate whole cell sonicate (described below).

Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.4.1.1, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Two independent experiments were performed for each strain and growth condition, each sample was analyzed twice. Only proteins identified in both biological samples and both replicate mass spectometry experiments under similar growth conditions were considered as vesicle-associated. For the liquid grown sonicate controls, one biological sample from each strain was analyzed twice and only proteins appearing in both analysis were considered associated with the purified sonicate. A normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) was used to quantify the relative amounts of individual proteins in each sample and values were averaged between the same biological and experimental samples [49] .",

When grown in BHI liquid media, D74 and Nagasaki strains reached maximum OD 600 values at approximately 2.1 and 1.3, with maximum CFU values of 2.5 \u00d7 10 9 /ml (D74) and 9 \u00d7 10 9 /ml (Nagasaki) (S1 Fig and Table 1 ). We observed an increase in extracellular structures via EM, particularly with the Nagasaki strain, when H. parasuis was grown on BHI plates, in comparison to Casman's and TS plates (S2 Fig). When grown on solid media, colonies appeared on BHI agar within 24 h and bacterial lawns were confluent within 48 h. For these reasons, we chose stationary phase liquid cultures (12 hours) using BHI media, as well as growth on BHI plates for 48 h, as conditions for examination of OMV production in strain D74 and Nagasaki. Additionally, we created a whole cell sonicate as a control condition where vesicles form spontaneously as a result of cell lysis. Bacterial preps from which OMV were isolated were diluted and plated to determine CFU and protein concentration for OMV was determined prior to density gradient separation (Table 1) .",

Protein in the whole cell sonicate (for both strains) was observed primarily in the 25-30% range of the density gradient (Lanes 4-6, Fig 1C and 1F ). For liquid isolated OMV, protein was detected throughout all of the density fractions (Fig 1A and 1D) . We relied on similar protein banding patterns observed in neighboring fractions (Fig 1A and 1D , Lanes 2-3 and 4-6) to determine which fractions to combine and recover for further analysis of OMV. Recovered fractions were also tested for total protein using BCA and quality of recovered vesicles verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig 2) . As can be seen in the micrographs, recovered OMV samples isolated from liquid grown cultures (Fig 2A and 2D ) contain typical round structures 50-200 nm in diameter, as well as some debris which may be capsular material or aggregated proteins. OMV samples isolated from plate grown cultures (Fig 2B and 2E ) contain some larger spherical structures (> 200 nm), in addition to the typical 50-200 nm OMV.

As a control, we included a whole cell lysate generated from liquid grown bacteria (Fig 3A and 3B, lanes 1 and 5) , as well as density purified whole cell sonicate generated from plate grown bacteria (Fig 3A and 3B, lanes 4 and 8) . Sonicate generated from liquid grown bacteria had similar profiles to that of plate grown bacteria and was not included (data not shown). We observed different protein profiles when we compared OMV isolated from liquid and plate grown bacteria (Fig 3A lanes 2 and 3, 6 and 7) or to vesicles generated by sonication, even when prepared from the same H. parasuis strain. OMVassociated proteins probed with H. parasuis immune sera showed differences in profiles between purified OMV and sonicate or lysate, as well as between the two strains ( Fig 3B) . Sera isolated from pigs prior to bacterin immunization showed minimal reactivity to the same H. parasuis OMV preparations (data not shown). There were similarities in protein banding patterns between purified OMV and sonicate, however the differences in protein abundance and immunoreactive protein patterns suggest that OMV content is not solely due to spontaneous vesicle formation by cell lysis. To further verify H. parasuis OMV exhibited similar properties to OMV described for other bacterial organisms, we performed a protease accessibility assay, which tests the ability of OMV structures to protect proteins against degradation by extracellular proteases [56] . Purified plate isolated OMV and sonicate were incubated with proteinase K (with or without SDS) and protein profiles then examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig 4) . The addition of SDS to vesicles had no effect on overall protein content (Fig 4, lanes 2 and 6) , however, incubation with proteinase K alone showed degradation of some surface exposed proteins (Fig 4, lanes 3 and 7) , an effect which was more pronounced in the sonicate than in the OMV (Fig 4. compare lane 5 to 7, white arrows). When samples were incubated with proteinase K in the presence of SDS, we observed degradation of nearly every protein, regardless of the method used to prepare samples (Fig 4, lanes 4 and 8) .",

RNA was collected from stimulated AMac, and real-time PCR was performed to determine cytokine transcript levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and IL-10 in response to stimulation relative to non-stimulated cells. Live Nagasaki bacteria induced transcription of all cytokines evaluated above the level of the LPS control, with the exception of IL-1\u03b2, where there was no significant difference between any of the treatments (Fig 6) . Both liquid-and platederived OMV, and sonicate from Nagasaki stimulated the production of transcripts for the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 at levels that were similar to that of LPS or live bacteria. Only production of the chemokine IL-8 transcript was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in comparison to the LPS control when AMac were stimulated with liquid derived OMV from Nagasaki (Fig 6) . Similarly, production of TNF-\u03b1 transcript was decreased (p<0.05) in comparison to live bacterial stimulation when AMac were stimulated with Nagasaki plate OMV. Transcription of IL-10 was significantly higher in AMac stimulated by live bacteria compared to all other treatments (Fig 6) . These results demonstrate that purified OMV and sonicate isolated from strain Nagasaki are able to stimulate cytokine transcription in AMac to similar levels as the live bacteria in most instances (TNF-\u03b1 plate OMV and IL-10 stimulation being the exceptions). We measured the cytotoxicity of LPS and OMV using a LDH release assay and found that OMV were not significantly cytotoxic to AMac (data not shown). We vaccinated pigs by intramuscular injection with Nagasaki liquid-derived OMV or liquid-derived sonicate to evaluate the protective capacity of H. parasuis-derived OMV. Vaccinated pigs were subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of the Nagasaki strain of H. parasuis administered by the intranasal route. All vaccinated pigs survived up to 15 days postintranasal challenge, while 3 of the 4 non-vaccinated control pigs died within 3 days of challenge (Fig 7, p = 0.0028) .",

In contrast, sera from OMV and sonicate vaccinated pigs reacted to a number of additional H. parasuis proteins post-vaccination, which was not present when probing with the pre-vaccine sera (Fig 8A, OMV and Sonicate, right panels). We also performed an endpoint titration ELISA to determine anti-H. parasuis IgG antibody levels in sera isolated from individual pigs both pre-and post-vaccination. Results showed that vaccination with either OMV or sonicate induced significantly higher anti-H. parasuis IgG titers (1 LogX greater, OMV p = 0.0028, Sonicate p = 0.0041) when compared to titers for prevaccination sera or the PBS control sera (Fig 8B) .",

A number of complex media and growth conditions were examined to find optimal conditions for growing H. parasuis for subsequent isolation of OMV. In addition to spherical OMV, tubular structures were observed under different growth conditions in both strains. Similar tubular structures have been reported in a number of other organisms and researchers have demonstrated roles in intercellular communication, attachment to host cells and extracellular electron transport [57] [58] [59] . While we have not identified the purpose of these tubular structures in H. parasuis, the observed increase in production on specific solid growth media does demonstrate a role in interaction with the environment. These data indicate that production of extracellular structures in tested strains of H. parasuis are influenced by culture media, growth conditions and is strain specific. This also highlights the importance in choice of growth media and cultivation methods when performing both in vivo and in vitro assays.",

Many of the most abundant OMV-associated proteins identified through mass spectrometry have previously been shown to be immunogenic, secreted or virulence factors in H. parasuis (Table 2) . Researchers have isolated OMV from H. influenzae (also a member of the Pasteurellaceae family) and identified associated virulence factors that have homologs in H. parasuis, which are also OMV-associated [43] . These include proteins involved in heme utilization, as well as the outer membrane porins P2 and P5. We also observed strong reactivity of porcine sera from Nagasaki bacterin vaccinated pigs to purified OMV-associated proteins, confirming that these structures contained numerous antigens. The reactivity of Nagasaki-specific immune sera to the D74 OMV-associated proteins demonstrates that there are immunogenic proteins conserved between the virulent and avirulent strains. We showed that H. parasuis Nagasaki OMV were able to protect associated proteins from degradation by proteases, similar to OMV studied in other bacteria [60] . Our findings show that naturally produced OMV were better able to protect protein content than a sample consisting of artificially generated vesicles (sonicate). The ability to protect cargo from protease degradation also shows that OMV may function in extracellular secretion in H. parasuis and confirms that our chosen method is a viable way to obtain OMV from this organism. Our results demonstrated that H. parasuis OMV are comparable to OMV isolated from other bacterial pathogens and likely contribute to the virulence of this organism.",

OMV isolated from bacteria grown in liquid media had 101 unique associated proteins, while plate grown strains had 284 unique associated proteins. The majority of the OMV-associated protein spectra (>70% of NSAF values) were found in both strains when the samples were isolated from bacteria propagated under the same growth conditions. A number of proteins that were found in OMV from both strains were predicted to localize to the cytoplasm, including chaperonin GroL (HPSD74_191 7, HPSNAG_2042), DNA-binding protein HU-alpha (HPSD74_0959, HPSNAG_0784), translation elongation factor G (HPSNAG_1930) and translation elongation factor Tu (HPSD74_1 362, HPSNAG_1121). The number of cytoplasmic proteins associated with OMV may be the result of bacterial lysis and association of proteins with the newly formed vesicles, or may be a type of vesicle that has been recently described, an outer-inner membrane vesicle (O-IMV) which are enriched in cytoplasmic proteins [61] . It is worth noting that predicted cytoplasmic proteins in the sonicate control samples were more abundant (47% and 43%) than in any of the naturally produced OMV samples, which indicates that the number of proteins associated with OMV were not solely due to bacterial lysis. Additionally, a number of bacterial OMV have been examined in other organisms and some researchers have reported a high percentage (> 30%) of cytoplasmic proteins associated with these structures [62, 63] . Since OMV isolated from both strains were not significantly cytotoxic to porcine AMac (data not shown), it remains to be discovered what benefit, if any, packaging these proteins into OMV provides the bacteria. The high abundance of some proteins in OMV would be the result of their abundance in the outer membrane of H. parasuis-thus, the proteins are included in vesicles as they are formed and inclusion is unrelated to pathogenesis.",

OMV from D74 and Nagasaki were not significantly cytotoxic to AMac, however, they were capable of stimulating cytokine transcription to similar levels as live bacteria. Thus, OMV in H. parasuis function in immune modulation in the host, a role that has been reported in other bacterial pathogens [43] . OMV derived from liquid grown Nagasaki were able to stimulate production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 to levels that were not significantly different from live bacteria. Plate derived OMV were able to stimulate IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 to levels comparable to the live bacteria. These results are in agreement with findings by other researchers in which OMV produced by H. influenzae, Helicobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas were shown to stimulate production of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 [43, [64] [65] [66] [67] . Interestingly, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by AMac was not significantly increased in comparison to live bacteria for any of the Nagasaki vesicles tested (liquid, plate or sonicate). This finding is in contrast to results previously seen by other researchers stimulating host dendritic cells with OMV isolated from Neisseria meningitidis, in which significant production of IL-10 was observed [68] . This may indicate that cell types are differentially effected by OMV (alveolar macrophages versus dendritic cells), that the observed level of stimulation is the maximum for the concentration of OMV used, or alternatively, that the live bacteria are somehow able to stimulate an IL-10 response [69] , but OMV does not (lowering the immune response). Further research with H. parasuis OMV and other cell types may help to determine what role the OMV may be playing in immune modulation of the host.",

It's important to note that the OMV and sonicate were delivered without the addition of any adjuvant, unlike the commercial OMV vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis. Liquid-derived OMV from strain Nagasaki also contained the fewest proteins of any of the OMV or sonicate preparations but was still protective, narrowing the list of potential candidates for use in a subunit vaccine. Our results showed that the observed protection was associated with an antibody response to specific OMV-associated proteins and confirmed that there was a significant increase in peripheral H. parasuis-specific antibody in vaccinated pigs. Importantly, in our ELISA experiment, pre-challenge sera from the single surviving control pig did not exhibit increased reactivity above that of the other control pigs, evidence that survival was not due to prior exposure to Haemophilus. The surviving control pig was derived from a separate litter than the other vaccinated animals in this experiment suggesting individual genetic background may be important in resistance to infection with H. parasuis. These results demonstrate that OMV and sonicate derived from a pathogenic strain of H. parasuis were capable of eliciting a protective immune response. This also highlights the natural immunogenic properties of OMV, as these structures were given to the host without the use of an adjuvant.",

While OMV production and host response to these structures have been studied for nearly 30 years in the related H. influenzae, no research has been performed on these subjects in H. parasuis. Researchers have examined the use of nontypeable H. influenzae OMV as a potential vaccine, discovered that OMV are able to induce cross-protective immunity in mice and are capable of diverting the host humoral response via a novel virulence mechanism [35] . Currently the preferred method of protecting swine involves vaccination with bacterin based vaccines; however, the efficacy of these are limited and cross-protection against additional strains of H. parasuis is unpredictable [11] . It may be possible to create a multivalent vaccine using OMV (or sonicate) from numerous strains of H. parasuis that can provide protection against multiple strains. Examination of OMV from additional strains of H. parasuis, as well as their effect on additional host cell types, will give more insight into the virulence factors utilized by this organism to cause disease in swine, as well as provide useful targets for inclusion into a vaccine.
