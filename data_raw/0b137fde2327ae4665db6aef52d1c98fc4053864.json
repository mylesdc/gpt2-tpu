Despite their classification as medicinal products is already well recognized, there is still a lack of information and indications to validate methods and to adapt the noncompendial and compendial methods to these peculiar biological products with intrinsic characteristics that differentiate them from classic synthetic or biologic drugs. In the present paper, we present the results of the validation studies performed in the context of MSC development as ATMPs for clinical experimental use. Specifically, we describe the validation policies followed for sterility testing, endotoxins, adventitious viruses, cell count, and immunophenotyping. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to fully validate analytical methods also for ATMPs and that a risk-based approach can fill the gap between the prescription of the available guidelines shaped on traditional medicinal products and the peculiar characteristics of these novel and extremely promising new drugs.",

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) represent cell therapy products that under the European Union regulation [2] are classified as advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs). Consequently, their production must take place according to GMP standards. The quality control department of a medicinal product manufacturing plant has the aim to guarantee the quality of the product that relies on the evidence of a clear relationship between accurate measurements and critical quality attributes of the product such as safety, identity, purity, and potency. These issues are well described in specific guidelines of European Medicines Agency (EMA) [3] . Safety derives from the demonstration that the product does not contain adventitious agents: bacteria, fungi, and viruses as well as any other components that might represent a hazard for the patient who will receive it; the identity of the cellular components ensures the presence of the active substance and may consist of phenotypic and/or genotypic profile definition; purity demonstrates that the cell therapy product contains at high concentration the active substance and is free from other unwanted cell populations, as far it concerns the desired therapeutic effect. Lastly, potency assay measures the required biological activity in the final cell product, in relationship with the mechanism of action in general or for any defined clinical purpose.",

A validation activity is generally composed of four steps: (1) qualification of personnel and equipment used as prerequisite for all the operations; (2) description of the validation strategy in written and approved validation protocols; (3) performance of the validation experiments; and (4) collection of the results and considerations in a validation report [5] . The validation protocol should clearly define the roles and the responsibilities of each person and element involved in the validation performance, such as equipment, supplies, reagents, reference materials and standards and, above all, the validation parameters and the acceptance criteria that guarantee the fulfillment of the validation specifications. The ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines define the following parameters that should be considered for validation: accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, and range.",

As concerning the first class of products in this document is clearly declared that full validation of analytical procedures is not required, but demonstration of the methods' suitability may be sufficient, whereas validation is expected for clinical ATMPs in advanced experimental phases. In our experience [10] , risk assessment should always drive the ATMP developer choices, and based on this approach, we chose to validate all the methods whose results are used to release investigational ATMPs.

MVD value was calculated using the formula: EL \u00d7 C/\u03bb, where C corresponds to the concentration of test solution. Since we were dealing with a cell suspension and not with a chemical solution, it is impractical to measure the concentration of our product as mass, biological activity, or volume. Therefore, the value of C was fixed to 1, thus implying that each volume unit of the test solution corresponds to one unit of product. Preliminary test for interfering factors: this step was performed at various dilutions of the product (according to MVD) in order to find the best dilution not activating and/or inhibiting the enzymatic reaction.

As summarized in Table 1 , the first phase of the validation was aimed at defining the number of cells needed for optimal DNA/RNA extraction and amplification, also considering possible inhibiting effects from DMSO and genomic DNA that are obviously present in the samples. Three batches of reference cryopreserved CBMSC were thawed, counted, and prepared in three different cell doses (0.1, 0.5, and 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer ATL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and DNA and RNA were extracted using an automatic extractor EZ1 (Qiagen) in a final volume of 120 \u03bcL. For MGB Kit, PCR mix was added 1 : 1 in volume to genomic extract and the negative control of extraction. For each sample, two amplification reactions are carried out in a thermocycler (7300 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA): the first one was aimed to detect the MIEA gene (exon 4), for CMV, or the gene encoding the EBNA1 protein, for EBV and the second one was directed against the human beta globin gene, to verify that extraction and amplification were successfully carried out without inhibitions. For viral title determination, a standard curve was set using four scalar concentrations of plasmid DNA (1 \u00d7 10 2 , 1 \u00d7 10 3 , 1\u00d7 10 4 , and 1 \u00d7 10 5 copies) of the two viruses, according to kit's instructions. Only a standard curve with R 2 > 0 9 was accepted. For respiratory viruses, amplification was done adding 8 \u03bcL of extract to 17 \u03bcL of different master mix according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit contains two different controls: the first one is the PCR control (PCRC) that allows to verify if the amplification has been carried out correctly without inhibition by substances contained in the samples and the second one is the whole process control (WPC) which is a target against the Rnase that allows to verify if the whole process, from the extraction to the amplification, has happened correctly without inhibition. In order to assess the specificity test on MSC, the cells (BMMSC and CBMSC) were inoculated with two viral loads of known positive standard, according to the results of external quality program's report. Since it was not possible to use all the fifteen respiratory viruses to be inoculated to the cells, we decided to use as positive standards a representative DNA virus (adenovirus) and a RNA virus (enterovirus). The viral quantities used to spike the cells were comparable of a low and high viral load in a positive patient sample: 359 and 1436 copies for CMV, 656 and 1313 copies for EBV, 362 and 723 copies for adenovirus (AdV), and 1500 and 3000 copies for enterovirus (HEV).",

For the recovery calculation of the genome equivalent (gEq) copies in the sample, it was not possible to apply the formula indicated by the datasheet (built for plasma samples), so results were expressed as quantity of CMV and EBV target DNA (gEqu/reaction) that was present in the sample reaction and in positive control (consisting of viral nucleic acid alone).

The validation design for the immunophenotyping analysis ( Figure 2 ) was preceded by a preliminary phase consisting of, at first, the titration of each antibody used and then the instrument settings (including fluorescence voltages and compensation setup). The validation phase consisted in the evaluation of the parameters in compliance with ICH Q2. We used the cytometer FACS CANTO II (Becton Dickinson, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), whose reproducibly setup was checked with CS&T beads (BD) before each acquisition, according to manufacturer's instructions.

After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, and analyzed with the DIVA software program (BD). A minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed. The samples were evaluated in terms of percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFI-R), calculated as the ratio of the MFI of the positive cell population on the MFI of the negative cell population (unstained cells). These values were plotted as a function of antibody quantity to determine which dilution is the best for each antibody to be used in the following step of validation. The optimal titer was identified as the lower quantity allowing the greatest discrimination between positive and negative cells, that is, the first concentration allowing the reaching of the plateau.",

In particular, the time to complete the analysis may be an issue for ATMP product with a short shelf-life. In this regard, the paragraph 2.6.27 included in the previous edition of Ph. Eur. might have been incompatible with the need to release this kind of short-living ATMP product, thus making this issue suitable for being considered as a parametric test [16] . As we will more extensively comment below, the same paragraph 2.6.27 in the more recent edition of Ph. Eur. aims to facilitate the use of sterility analytical methods by including alternative approaches and reducing the incubation period, but time still remains an issue for those products that must be released immediately after the completion of the manufacturing process (fresh products). In our experience, some products, such as CBMSC, are cryopreserved before use and so the result of sterility is always available before release. Other products, such as BMMSC, must be released as fresh products and requires alternative approaches for validation and testing. For CBMSC as well as other cryopreserved products, the validation study was designed with the aim to verify if any of the cryopreservation solution components (DMSO, normal saline, and human albumin) could interfere with the detection of microorganisms. The method selected was the direct inoculation of the sample into test media as described in Ph. Eur. Chapter 2.6.27 that fits specifically with cell products while the membrane filtration method described in Ph. Eur. Chapter 2.6.1. may present difficulties when applied to cells. The main challenge of this validation was to define the most representative sample of the final product, in terms of volume and conditions (fresh versus cryopreserved).",

In this regard, the main changes to previous version concern a greater flexibility for the incubation temperature(s), a change in the list of microorganisms to be tested (Yersinia enterocolitica is replaced by Micrococcus luteus that is more appropriate as it is a common contaminant of cellbased preparations), and information about the sensitivity to be achieved during validation has also been included. Several authors have already been demonstrated that, for example, automated sterility testing is capable of rapidly detecting low-level contamination, with an average of 2.5 days [18] and within 48 hours [19] for different biopharmaceutical and transplantation products (e.g., pancreatic islets).

In this paper, we present the results of the validation using a kinetic chromogenic test in which the reaction time of the sample is compared with that of control standard endotoxins (CSE). The reaction time of the sample is defined \"onset time\" (time to achieve a given level of optical density). The first aim of the validation design was to verify the suitability of the reagents and specifically the sensitivity of the CSE. For the chromogenic method, this step is represented by the assurance of the standard curve criteria. We verified that the three values of endotoxin tested in the cartridge (0.5-0.05-0.005 EU/mL) and reported in the standard endotoxin certificate of analysis include a central value that corresponded to the amount of endotoxin loaded as positive control in the cartridge itself and that the last value corresponded to sensitivity (\u03bb). Moreover, we checked that the standard curve provided by the supplier had a linearity value of 0.998. Secondly, the validation on the product must be performed with several purposes: (1) to identify possible interference by the product itself, (2) to show that the chosen dilution does not interfere, and (3) to eliminate the possible sources of interference by different means (e.g., heating). Before starting with the validation study, the specific endotoxin limit (EL) and the maximum valid dilution (MVD) must be calculated for each specific product as described in Materials and Methods. The calculation of EL and MVD for LAL test on ATMP product is a good example of how difficult is the adaptation of compendial methods that have been set on standard pharmacologic products. In fact, Ph. Eur. states that for new medicinal product, EL and MVD must be calculated by the user basing on administration routes and other pharmacological parameters, but there are still no defined guidelines that explain the rational to be followed to define these values for ATMP. Moreover, in the literature, some authors just indicate the values without giving any justification on the calculation made to determine them [6] , while others chose the EL value of 0.5 EU/mL [7] , as requested by the Food and Drug Administration for general medical devices or for individual drug products that has a maximum human dose of 10 mL/kg [20] . In our condition, we tried to respect as much as possible the \"spirit\" of Ph. Eur. criteria by calculating the EL and MVD of our products in consideration of their clinical use.

As shown in Figure 3 (a), for the respiratory viruses, in all the samples, the band of the internal control (PCRC) and that of the whole process control (WPC) were present; there was a specific signal for AdV and HEV, not only in its positive control but also in the samples spiked with both viral loads and as expected, no specific bands resulted in negative controls.

The lack of specific and distinct cell surface markers and the heterogeneity of the characterization studies led, more than ten years ago, the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) to publish the minimal criteria for defining MSC [27] . In addition to plastic adherence and in vitro differentiation potential, it was defined that MSC are characterized by the expression of CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack of expression of hematopoietic and endothelial surface markers such as CD14, CD45, CD34, CD11b, HLA-DR, and CD31. Currently, these criteria are still used as accepted standards to define MSC for clinical application. Flow cytometry represents the most widely used method for immunophenotypic analysis also in GMP settings, as it allows a fast, multiparametric analysis of a cell suspension. Nevertheless, as some authors have already underlined [28, 29] , assessment of the analytical measurement as sensitivity and linearity for the validation of this method is affected by the lack of cellular reference materials and the difficulty in obtaining adequate controls (e.g., cell lines with varying levels of a given marker expression).",
