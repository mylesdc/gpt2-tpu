In cardiorespiratory rehabilitation programs, the improvement of physical condition and function is achieved by specific exercises of the upper and lower limbs. Aerobic exercise and muscle strengthening, when applied systematically and with the appropriate individualized methodology (Garber et al., 2011) helps patients with decline in cardio-respiratory and neuromuscular function to restore their autonomy, improve their psychological status and eventually their quality of life (Morey et al., 2009 , NICE, 2009 , Rees et al., 2004 . It is likely that such an approach could help ICU patients to return to their baseline (before ICU admission) level of activity and may improve their health and physical condition even more. In addition, it could reduce health care related burden and costs at both primary and secondary levels (medication use, GP and specialty visits, hospital readmissions, complications etc.). Therefore, it is essential that safe and effective rehabilitation programs for health improvement in post-ICU patients be available on either a hospital or community basis.",

The exercise programs are not usually accessible to patients either because their situation does not allow easy transportation, or because they imply serious economic expenses and time consuming transportation. Due to the lack of competent exercise programs, patients often fail to regain their skills and their status can gradually deteriorate with impact on mortality, morbidity, and extra cost for their families and health system (Loyalka et al., 2014 , Snook & Webster, 1987 . Exercise telerehabilitation programs could surpass the above obstacles, increase accessibility and 1 http://telerehabilitation.cs.ucy.ac.cy/en enhance adherence for post ICU patients as well as for other vulnerable populations such as people with disabilities (Demiris et al., 2005 , Winters, 2002 .

(2011) the success of tele-supervised exercise programs (telerehabilitation) for specific groups of patients has been demonstrated by several studies. Indeed, the systematic review of 11 telerehabilitation trials for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (Neubeck et al., 2009) showed significant improvements on CHD risk factors including exercise adherence and volume, and positive alterations in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. While studies conducted with people in the chronic phase following stroke, as described in the review of Laver et al. (2013) , might have provided insufficient evidence of effectiveness, they indicated that remotely assisted exercise programs in this population are feasible. In 13 of the 19 studies reviewed by Hailey et al. (2013) the application of telerehabilitation in patients with neurological conditions provided at least equivalent outcomes to conventional approaches. Furthermore, both health professionals and patients reported high satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions (Johansson & Wild, 2011) .",

Table 1 depicts the role-based responsibilities of the staff. Patients who are selected to participate in the program, follow a 12-week exercise rehabilitation program (Table 2 ). An exercise program adapted to the patient's needs is determined by an ICU physician, an ergophysiologist and a physiotherapist after initial assessment. For patients with heart failure or respiratory failure, the exercise program is determined by an external expert. Patients, selected to participate in the program, need to follow a 12-week exercise training rehabilitation program. The exercise program constitutes of consecutively continuous and interval aerobic exercise, endurance exercise and stretching (Table 2) . Endurance exercises progress every week ( Table 2) following assessment of patients' biosignal responses to current set of exercises, dyspnea, psychological factors etc. After initial assessment of the patient, the training exercise program adapted to the patient's needs is determined by an ICU physician, a clinical exercise physiologist, and a physiotherapist. For patients with heart failure or respiratory failure, the exercise program is determined by the clinical exercise physiologist in collaboration with the patient's cardiologist.

To enable biosignals monitoring and transmission, wearable lightweight, portable (battery powered) wireless (802.11b) devices with biosignal sensors are involved.

A belt, attached to the patient's waist and shoulder, guarantees security and stability of the devices. Furthermore, to facilitate the exercise rehabilitation program, the following exercise equipment accompanies a home station: (a) electromagnetic legs ergometer that features adjustable workload from 10 to 350 watt (interval steps of 5 watt) directly from the console, a flywheel \u2265 6Kg, vertical and horizontal adjustable handlebars, vertical and horizontal user adjustable saddle, wide gel padded seat and pedals with quick adjustment strap.

The majority of the noneligible patients (75%) were patients with ICU stay less than 48hrs; therefore, patients with low probability of ICU related disability. A telerehabilitation program for former ICU patients could be addressed with some changes from the above described, not only for the eligible patients of this study but also for patients with poor neurological outcome, poor functional ability, end stage chronic illness and probably hospital discharge to chronic health care facilities or other hospitals. These factors represent approximately 30% of the total patients. This suggests that one-third of former ICU patients can participate in a home-based telerehabilitation program. Furthermore, the above mentioned one-third includes the vast amount of patients who need rehabilitation after ICU hospitalization.",

This is implied by the fact that the calculated cost of a former ICU patient telerehabilitation program is about the same with one day of readmission in ICU (Dasta et al., 2005 , Judson & Fisher, 2006 . Furthermore, NPV and IRR gave a calculation of predicted benefit for the first five years of operation of the designed telerehabilitation service which supports that such an investment is profitable.",
