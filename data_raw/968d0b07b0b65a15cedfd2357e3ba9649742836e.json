Early intervention is a crucial prognostic factor and a HLA-haploidentical parental donor is often available. Haploidentical HSCT protocols utilizing extensively ex vivo T-cell depleted grafts (CliniMACs system) have proven efficient in preventing GvHD, but cause a delay in early T-cell recovery that increases the risk of viral infections. Here, we present a novel approach for treating SCID that combines selective depletion of GvHD-inducing alpha/beta (\u03b1/\u03b2) T-cells from the haploidentical HSCT graft with a subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) enriched for CD45RO+ memory T-cells.",

At 9 months of age, he received a T cell receptor(TCR)\u03b1/\u03b2-cell depleted graft from his haploidentical mother, following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen with no additional GvHD prophylaxis. Engraftment was rapid with complete donor chimerism and no signs of GvHD. However, at 12 weeks post HSCT, the patient was still T-cell lymphopenic with clinical symptoms of multiple severe viral infections. Consequently, therapeutic DLIs were initiated for enhanced anti-viral immunity. The patient was treated with CD45RA+ depleted haploidentical maternal donor lymphocytes enriched from unmobilized whole blood, and a total T-cell dose of no more than 25 x10 3 CD3+ cells/kg with >99.9 % purity of CD3 + CD45RO+ memory T-cells was transferred. Following the DLI, a prompt increase in CD3 + CD4+ and CD3 + CD8+ counts was observed with a subsequent clearance of viral infections. No acute or chronic GvHD was observed.",

ATG clearance vary between individuals and the efficacy of ATG varies between batches [19, 20] ; therefore an explanation of the lymphopenia could be that since we used ATG in a relatively high dose, given timewise quite close to the grafting, this affected the graft, hence could be considered as additional in vivo T-cell depletion.

Notwithstanding, cross-reactivity of memory viral-specific T-cells with mismatched HLA has been described and is, thus, a potential source of GvHD in haploidentical HSCT [27] . Based on these observations, the patient was treated with CD45RA+ depleted haploidentical donor lymphocytes, transferring a total T-cell dose of no more than 25 \u00d7 10 3 CD3+ cells/kg with >99.9 % purity of CD3+ CD45RO+ memory T-cells.

Na\u00efve T-cells (CD45RA+) were efficiently depleted (log -3.8) providing sufficient numbers of CD3 + CD45RO+ cells for the fresh DLI and for cryopreservation. A benefit of the current protocol is the time and cost effectiveness of using a whole blood donation rather than a leukapheresis product as starting material. Moreover, this approach is also less strenuous for the donor.",

New strategies have been developed for ex vivo selection of pathogen-specific donor T-cells, using antigen induced stimulation and isolation by cytokine secretion assay [24] or HLA-peptide streptamers [25] . However, this approach is time consuming and technically much more demanding than the simple method of cell depletion based on surface CD45RA+ antigen expression. Also, the generation of antigen stimulated T-cells for clinical application is subjected to a more complex regulatory framework than that of CD45RA+ depleted, unmanipulated lymphocytes. Recently, the often limited therapeutic effect of using antigen-specific T-cells has been attributed to the limited in vivo persistence of transferred donor T-cells [29] , suggesting that adoptive transfer should include a variety of donor T-cell populations to favor long-lasting clinical responses.",
