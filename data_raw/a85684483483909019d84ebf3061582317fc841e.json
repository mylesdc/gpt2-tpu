At the same time, a specific heterologous (horse) immunoglobulin against Ebola fever was developed at the Virology Center of the Research Institute of the Russian Defense Ministry for urgent prophylaxis and treatment of high-risk groups; the immunoglobulin had 100% protective activity in experiments with monkeys [9] . Due to the high mortality rate in the last EVD epidemic and spread of the virus outside Africa, a WHO Committee was convened in early August 2014. The Committee concluded that the EVD outbreak was an extraordinary event of international importance, which significantly accelerated the development of preventive and therapeutic agents for EVD. After 2 years, several vaccines had been developed. They are currently under different phases of clinical trial, and two vaccines developed in Russia have been registered for medical use.",

In contrast to DNA vaccines, these vectors provide a high and long-lasting level of target transgene expression, which enables the induction of protective immunity after one or two immunizations [16] [17] [18] . Experiments with direct comparison demonstrated much faster formation of the immune response to a recombinant viral vector-based candidate vaccine compared to a plasmid DNA-based vaccine [16] . It should be noted that immunization was associated not only with the humoral immune response, but also with a more pronounced cellular (CD8+ and CD4+) immune response, which later occurred to be the key aspect of protection against Ebola fever. Various studies have demonstrated that it is cellular immunity that plays a key role in the formation of protective immunity to the Ebola virus [19, 20] . Directed depletion of CD3+ (CD8+ and CD4+) cells in monkeys immunized against EVD caused a decrease in vaccinated protective immunity, which resulted in the death of all the animals from Ebola virus infection. If only CD8+ cells were depleted, the protective response also decreased in immunized monkeys: 80% of the animals died. At the same time, passive transfer of high-titer polyclonal antibodies to the Ebola virus from vaccinated monkeys to naive ones provided incomplete protection against lethal infection: 75% of the animals died despite the high titers of common IgGs and NtAbs in peripheral blood serum [20] . The importance of cellular immunity was indirectly confirmed by the fact that the peripheral blood of people who survived EVD contained an increased number of specific CD8+ cells compared to the blood of healthy people. At the same time, the number of specific CD4+ cells did not actually increase [21] .",

Six months after vaccination, the GP antibody titer significantly decreased and amounted to 1 : 198 (Table) . The volunteers were re-vaccinated 6 months after the primary vaccination. Four weeks after the revaccination, the vaccine induced a high level of GPspecific antibodies (titer of 1 : 11,825) in the blood serum of the volunteers. One year after the revaccination, the titer of GP-specific antibodies in the blood serum of the volunteers was 1 : 857. One of the main problems limiting the use of Ad5-based vectors is a wide prevalence of pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (the presence of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies) in the population. The presence of Ad5 antibodies before vaccination was shown to lead to the induction of a lower GP-specific humoral and T-cell response after vaccination [29, 30] . However, clinical trials in China demonstrated that the use of a high dose of an Ad5based vaccine may reduce the negative effect of pre-existing immunity on the formation of a GP-specific immune response [29] .",

These were the first cases when the virus was detected in urban centers, and the virus could spread outside of Africa to Europe and North America. The spread of the Ebola virus outside of Africa during the 2014-2016 EVD epidemic and the high mortality rate were a solid reason for the active development of effective preventive and therapeutic remedies.
