Previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20 L ) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. Here we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in protein GB1, containing 20 4 = 160,000 variants. We found that while reciprocal sign epistasis blocked many direct paths of adaptation, such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by indirect paths through genotype space involving gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on adaptive protein evolution, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may change our views on how proteins evolve.",

Large-scale datasets combined with quantitative analysis have successfully unraveled important features of empirical fitness landscapes (Kouyos et al., 2012; Barton et al., 2015; Szendro et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between the limited throughput of fitness measurements (usually on the order of 10 2 variants) and the vast size of sequence space. Recently, the bottleneck in experimental throughput has been improved substantially by coupling saturation mutagenesis with deep sequencing (Fowler et al., 2010; Hietpas et al., 2011; Jacquier et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014; Qi et al., 2014; Stiffler et al., 2015) , which opens up unprecedented opportunities to understand the structure of high-dimensional fitness landscapes (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2013; Pitt and Ferr\u00e9-D'Amar\u00e9, 2010; Payne and Wagner, 2014) .",

            "text": "Previous empirical studies on combinatorially complete fitness landscapes have been limited to subgraphs of the sequence space consisting of only two amino acids at each site (2 L genotypes) (Weinreich et al., 2006; Lunzer et al., 2005; O'Maille et al., 2008; Lozovsky et al., 2009; Franke et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011) . Most studies of adaptive walks in these diallelic sequence spaces focused on \"direct paths\" where each mutational step reduces the Hamming distance from the starting point to the destination. However, it has also been shown that mutational reversions can occur during adaptive walks in diallelic sequence spaces such that adaptation proceeds via \"indirect paths\" (DePristo et al., 2007; Berestycki et al., 2014; Martinsson, 2015; Li, 2015; Palmer et al., 2015) . In sequence space with higher dimensionality (20 L , for a protein sequence with L amino acid residues), the extra dimensions may further provide additional routes for adaptation (Gavrilets, 1997; Cariani, 2002) . Although the existence of indirect paths has been implied in different contexts, it has not been studied systematically and its influence on protein adaptation remains unclear. Another underappreciated property of fitness landscapes is the influence of higher-order interactions. Empirical evidence suggests that pairwise epistasis is prevalent in fitness landscapes (Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011; Kouyos et al., 2012; O'Maille et al., 2008; Lozovsky et al., 2009) . Specifically, sign epistasis between two loci is known to constrain adaptation by limiting the number of selectively accessible paths (Weinreich et al., 2006) . Higher-order epistasis (i.e. interactions among more than two loci) has received much less attention and its role in adaptation is yet to be elucidated (Weinreich et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2015) .",

Thus the sequence eLife digest Proteins can evolve over time by changing their component parts, which are called amino acids. These changes usually happen one at a time and natural selection tends to preserve those changes that make the protein more efficient at its specific tasks, while discarding those that impair the protein's activity. However the effect of each change depends on the protein as a whole, and so two changes that separately make the protein worse can make it much better if they occur together. This phenomenon is called epistasis and in some cases it can trap proteins in a suboptimal form and prevent them from improving further.",

Overcoming epistasis typically involved making a change to one amino acid that paved the way for further changes while avoiding the need to lose fitness. The original change could then be reversed once the epistasis was overcome.

Moreover, this empirical fitness landscape is expected to provide us insights on how high dimensionality and epistasis would influence evolutionary accessibility. Briefly, a mutant library containing all amino acid combinations at these four sites was generated by codon randomization. The \"fitness\" of protein GB1 variants, as determined by both stability (i.e. the fraction of folded proteins) and function (i.e. binding affinity to IgG-Fc), was measured in a high-throughput manner by coupling mRNA display with Illumina sequencing (see Materials and methods, Figure 1 figure supplement 3) (Roberts and Szostak, 1997; Olson et al., 2012) . The relative frequency of mutant sequences before and after selection allowed us to compute the fitness of each variant relative to the wild type protein (WT). While most mutants had a lower fitness compared to WT (fitness < 1), 2.4% of mutants were beneficial (fitness > 1). (Figure 1-figure supplement 4) . We note that this study does not aim to extrapolate protein fitness to organismal fitness. Although there are examples showing that protein fitness in vitro correlates with organismal fitness in vivo (Natarajan et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012) , this relation may not be linear and is likely to be systemspecific due to the difference in selection pressures in vitro and in vivo (P\u00e1l et al., 2006; Hingorani and Gierasch, 2014) .",

            "text": "To understand the impact of epistasis on protein adaptation, we first analyzed subgraphs of sequence space including only two amino acids at each site ( Figure 1A) . Each subgraph represented a classical adaptive landscape connecting WT to a beneficial quadruple mutant, analogous to previously studied protein fitness landscapes (Weinreich et al., 2006; Szendro et al., 2013) . Each variant is denoted by the single letter code of amino acids across sites 39, 40, 41 and 54 (for example, WT sequence is VDGV). Each subgraph is combinatorially complete with 2 4 = 16 variants, including WT, the quadruple mutant, and all intermediate variants. We identified a total of 29 subgraphs in which the quadruple mutant was the only fitness peak. By focusing on these subgraphs, we essentially limited the analysis to direct paths of adaptation, where each step would reduce the Hamming distance from the starting point (WT) to the destination (quadruple mutant). Out of 24 possible direct paths, the number of selectively accessible paths (i.e. with monotonically increasing fitness) varied from 12 to 1 among the 29 subgraphs ( Figure 1B ). In the most extreme case, only one path was accessible from WT to the quadruple mutant WLFA ( Figure 1A) . We also observed a substantial skew in the computed probability of realization among accessible direct paths (Figure 1-figure supplement 5), suggesting that most of the realizations in adaptation were captured by a small fraction of possible trajectories (Weinreich et al., 2006) . These results indicated the existence of sign epistasis and reciprocal sign epistasis, both of which may constrain the accessibility of direct paths (Weinreich et al., 2006; Tufts et al., 2015) . Indeed, we found that these two types of epistasis were prevalent in our fitness landscape ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, we classified the types of all 24 pairwise epistasis in each subgraph and computed the level of ruggedness as f sign \u00fe 2f reciprocal , where f type was the fraction of each type of pairwise epistasis. As expected, the number of selectively inaccessible direct paths, i.e. paths that involve fitness declines, was found to be positively correlated with the ruggedness induced by pairwise epistasis (Figure 1 -figure supplement 6, Pearson correlation = 0.66, p=1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ) (Poelwijk et al., 2007) .",

In particular, adaptation can be trapped when direct paths are blocked by reciprocal sign epistasis. However, crucially, this analysis was limited to mutational trajectories within a subgraph of the sequence space. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher. Intuitively, when an extra dimension is introduced, a local maximum may become a saddle point and allow for further adaptation -a phenomenon that is also known as \"extra-dimensional bypass\" (Gavrilets, 1997; Cariani, 2002; Guti\u00e9rrez and Maere, 2014) . With our experimental data, we observed two distinct mechanisms of bypass, either using an extra amino acid at the same site or using an additional site, that allow proteins to continue adaptation when no direct paths were accessible due to reciprocal sign epistasis ( Figure 2 ). The first mechanism of bypass, which we termed \"conversion We identified a total of 29 subgraphs in which the quadruple mutant was the only fitness peak. The number of accessible direct paths from WT to the quadruple mutant is shown for each subgraph. The maximum number of direct paths is 24.

We note that this analysis is different from previous studies on how epistasis changes along adaptive walks, where the quadruples are chosen such that the fitness values of genotype 00, 01 and 11 are in increasing order (Greene and Crona, 2014) . Sign epistasis and reciprocal sign epistasis, both of which can block adaptive paths, are prevalent in the fitness landscape. Classification scheme of epistasis is shown at the top. Each node represents a genotype, which is within a sequence space of two loci and two alleles. Green arrows represent the accessible paths from genotype \"00\" to a beneficial double mutant \"11\" (colored in red). DOI: 10.7554/eLife.16965.003",

The starting point is 00 and the destination is 11 (in red). Green arrows indicate the accessible path. A successful bypass would require a \"conversion\" step that substitutes one of the two interacting sites with an extra amino acid (00 ! 20), followed by the loss of this mutation later (21 ! 11). The original reciprocal sign epistasis is changed to sign epistasis on the new genetic background after conversion. (B) Among~20,000 randomly sampled reciprocal sign epistasis, >40% of them can be circumvented by at least one conversion bypass (i.e. success, inset). The number of available bypass for the success cases is shown as histogram. (C) The second mechanism of bypass involves an additional site. In this case, adaptation involves a \"detour\" step to gain mutation at the third site (000 ! 100), followed by the loss of this mutation (111 ! 011). The original reciprocal sign epistasis is changed to either magnitude epistasis or sign epistasis on the new genetic background after detour ( bypass\", works by converting to an extra amino acid at one of the interacting sites (Palmer et al., 2015) . Consider a simple scenario with only two interacting sites. If the sequence space is limited to 2 amino acids at each site, as in past analyses of adaptive trajectories, the number of neighbors is 2; however, if all 20 possible amino acids were considered, the total number of neighbors would be 38. Some of these 36 extra neighbors may lead to potential routes that circumvent the reciprocal sign epistasis ( Figure 2A ). In this case, a successful bypass would require a conversion step that substitutes one of the two interacting sites with an extra amino acid (00 ! 20), followed by the loss of this mutation (21 ! 11). This bypass is feasible only if the original reciprocal sign epistasis is changed to sign epistasis after the conversion. To test whether such bypasses were present in our system, we randomly sampled 10 5 pairwise interactions from the sequence space and analyzed the~20,000 reciprocal sign epistasis among them (see Materials and methods). More than 40% of the time there was at least one successful conversion bypass and in many cases multiple bypasses were available ( Figure 2B ). The second mechanism of bypass, which we termed \"detour bypass\", involves an additional site ( Figure 2C ). In this case, adaptation can proceed by taking a detour step to gain a mutation at the third site (000 ! 100), followed by the later loss of this mutation (111 ! 011) (DePristo et al., 2007; Palmer et al., 2015) . Detour bypass was observed in our system ( Figure 2D ), but was not as prevalent and had a lower probability of success than conversion bypass. Out of 38 possible detour bypasses for a chosen reciprocal sign epistasis, we found that there were on average 1.2 conversion bypasses and 0.27 detour bypasses available. We note, however, that the lower prevalence of detour bypass in our fitness landscape (L=4) does not necessarily mean that it should be expected to be less frequent than conversion bypass in other systems. While the maximum number of possible conversion bypasses is always fixed (19 \u00c2 2 \u00c0 2 \u00bc 36), the maximum number of possible detour bypasses (19 \u00c2 (L \u00c0 2)) is proportional to the sequence length L of the entire protein (whereas our study uses a subset L = 4). The pervasiveness of extra-dimensional bypasses in our system contrasts with the prevailing view that adaptive evolution is often blocked by reciprocal sign epistasis, when only direct paths of adaptation are considered. The two distinct mechanisms of bypass both require the use of indirect paths, where the Hamming distance to the destination is either unchanged (conversion) or increased (detour).",

The Fourier coefficients can be interpreted as epistatic interactions of different orders (Weinreich et al., 2013; de Visser and Krug, 2014) , including the main effects of single mutations (the first order), pairwise epistasis (the second order), and higher-order epistasis (the third and the fourth order). The fitness of variants can be reconstructed by expansion of Fourier coefficients up to a certain order (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). In our system with four sites, the fourth order Fourier expansion will always reproduce the measured fitness (i.e. the fraction of variance in fitness explained equals 1). When the second order Fourier expansion does not reproduce the measured fitness, it indicates the presence of higher-order epistasis. In this way, we identified the 0.1% of subgraphs with greatest fitness contribution from higher-order epistasis ( Figure 3A , red lines) and visualized the corresponding quadruple mutants by the sequence logo plot ( Figure 3B ). The skewed composition of amino acids in these subgraphs indicates that higherorder interactions are enriched among specific amino acid combinations of site 39, 41 and 54. This interaction among 3 sites is consistent with our knowledge of the protein structure, where the side chains of sites 39, 41, and 54 can physically interact with each other at the core (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) and destabilize the protein due to steric effects ( Figure 3-figure supplement 3) .",

For example, G41L and V54H were positively epistatic when site 39 was isoleucine [I], but the interaction changed to negative epistasis when site 39 carried a tyrosine [Y] or a tryptophan [W] ( Figure 3C-D) . Similar patterns were observed in other pairwise interactions among site 39, 41 and 54, such as G41F/V54A and V39W/V54H (Figure 3-figure supplement 4) . The observed pattern of higher-order epistasis was consistent with the results of the Fourier analysis ( Figure 3B ). For example, site 40 was mostly excluded from higher-order epistasis; tyrosine [Y] or tryptophan [W] at site 39 were involved in the most significant higher-order interactions, as they often changed the sign of pairwise epistasis. Higher-order epistasis can also switch the type of pairwise epistasis, such as shifting from reciprocal sign epistasis to magnitude or sign epistasis (Figure 3-figure supplement 5), which in turn is important for the existence of detour bypass.",

The other two models assign a nonzero fixation probability to all beneficial mutations, either weighted by (Correlated Fixation Model) or independent of (Equal Fixation Model) the relative fitness gain. The Greedy Model represents adaptive evolution of a large population with pervasive clonal interference (de Visser and Krug, 2014). The Correlated Fixation Model represents adaptive evolution of a population under the scheme of strong-selection/weak-mutation (SSWM) (Gillespie, 1984) , which assumes that the time to fixation is much shorter than the time between mutations and the fixation probability of a given mutation is proportional to the improvement in fitness. The Equal Fixation Model represents a simplified scenario of adaptation where all beneficial mutations fix with equal probability (Weinreich et al., 2006) .",

We classified each step on the adaptive paths into three categories based on the change of Hamming distance to the destination (a fitness peak, in this case): \"towards (-1)\", \"conversion (0)\", and \"detour (+1)\" ( Figure 4C ). Conversion was found to be pervasive during adaptation in our fitness landscape (17% of mutational steps for Greedy Model, 41% for Correlated Fixation Model, 59% for Equal Fixation Model). The use of detour was less frequent (0.1% of mutational steps for Greedy Model, 1.3% for Correlated Fixation Model, 3.7% for Equal Fixation Model), in accordance with the previous observation that detour bypass was less available than conversion bypass in our fitness landscape with L \u00bc 4. A conversion step would increase the length of an adaptive path by 1, while a detour step would increase the length by 2. As a result, an indirect path can be substantially longer than a direct path consisting of only \"towards\" steps. We found that many of the adaptive paths required more than 4 steps, which was the maximal length of a direct path between any variants in this landscape ( Figure 4D ). Interestingly, because indirect adaptive paths involved more variants of intermediate fitness, the use of conversion and detour steps depended on the strength of selection. Consistent with previous studies (Orr, 2002 (Orr, , 2003 , when mutations conferring larger fitness gains were more likely to fix (e.g. Greedy Model and Correlated Fixation Model), adaptation favored direct moves toward the destination, thus leading to a shorter adaptive paths ( Figure 4C-D) . This suggests that the strength of selection interacts with the topological structure of fitness landscapes to determine the length and directness of evolutionary trajectories.",

Indeed, we found that indirect paths increased the number of genotypes with access to each fitness peak ( Figure 4E ). In addition, the fraction of genotypes with accessible paths to all 15 fitness peaks increased from from 34% to 93% when indirect adaptive paths were allowed (Figure 4-figure supplement 2C) . We also found that a substantial fraction of beneficial variants (fitness > 1) in the sequence space were accessible from WT only if indirect paths were used ( Figure 4F) . We repeated the analysis in Figure 4F with the consideration of the constraints imposed by the standard genetic code (Figure 4 -figure supplement 3A). The constraints from the genetic code decreased the number of accessible variants due to the reduction in connectivity. However, this reduction in connectivity did not alter our core finding that indirect paths substantially increase evolutionary accessibility (Figure 4 -figure supplement 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that indirect paths promote evolutionary accessibility in rugged fitness landscapes. This enhanced accessibility would allow proteins to explore more sequence space and lead to delayed commitment to evolutionary fates (i.e. fitness peaks) (Palmer et al., 2015) . Consistent with this expectation, our simulations showed that many mutational trajectories involving extra-dimensional bypass did not fully commit to a fitness peak until the last two steps (Figure 4-figure supplement 4 ).",

            "text": "In our analysis, we have limited adaptation to the regime where fitness is monotonically increasing via sequential fixation of one-step beneficial mutants. When this assumption is relaxed, adaptation can sometimes proceed by crossing fitness valleys, such as via genetic drift or recombination (de Visser and Krug, 2014; Weissman et al., 2009; Ostman et al., 2012; Poelwijk et al., 2007; Weissman et al., 2010) . Another simplification in most of our analyses is to treat all sequences in a \"protein space\" (Smith, 1970) , where two sequences are considered as neighbors if they differ by a single amino-acid substitution. In practice, amino acid substitutions occurring via a single nucleotide mutation are limited by the genetic code, so the total number of one-step neighbors would be (Figure 4-figure supplement 3) . We also expect fitness landscapes of different systems to have different topological structure. Even in our system (with >93% coverage of the genotype space), the global structure of the fitness landscape is influenced by the imputed fitness values of missing variants, which can vary when different fitness models or fitting methods are used. Our analysis also ignored measurement errors, but the measurement errors are expected to be very small due to the high reproducibility in the data (Figure 1 -figure supplement 3B). Both imputation of missing variants and measurement errors can lead to slight mis-specification of the topological structure of the fitness landscape. Finally, we note that the four amino acids chosen in our study are in physical proximity and have strong epistatic interactions. While the availability of conversion bypass only depends on the dimensionality at each site, the degree of higher-order epistasis and the availability of detour bypasses can be quite different in other fitness landscapes. Although the details of a particular fitness landscape can influence the quantitative role of different bypass mechanisms, this does not undermine the generality of our conceptual findings on extra-dimensional bypass, higher-order epistasis, and their roles in protein evolution.",

In this study, we observed the presence of higher-order epistasis and systematically quantified its contribution to protein fitness. Our results suggest that higher-order epistasis can either increase or decrease the ruggedness induced by pairwise epistasis, which in turn determines the accessibility of direct paths in a rugged fitness landscape (Figure 3-figure supplement 6). We also revealed the important role of higher-order epistasis in mediating detour bypass, which could promote evolutionary accessibility via indirect paths. Our work demonstrates that even in the most rugged regions of a protein fitness landscape, most of the sequence space can remain highly accessible owing to the indirect paths opened up by high dimensionality. The enhanced accessibility mediated by indirect paths may provide a partial explanation for some observations in viral evolution. For example, throughout the course of infection HIV always seems to find a way to revert to the global consensus sequence, a putatively \"optimal\" HIV-1 sequence after immune invasion (Zanini et al., 2015) . As we pointed out, the possible number of detour bypasses scales up with sequence length, so it will be interesting to study how extra-dimensional bypass influences adaptation in sequence space of even higher dimensionality. For example, it is plausible that the sequence of a large protein may never be trapped in adaptation (Gavrilets, 1997) , so that adaptive accessibility becomes a quantitative rather than qualitative problem.",

A total of 20 4 = 160,000 nodes were present in the directed graph, where each node represented a 4-site variant. For all pairs of variants separated by a Hamming distance of 1, a directed edge was generated from the variant with a lower fitness to the variant with a higher fitness. Therefore, all successors of a given node had a higher fitness than the given node. A fitness peak was defined as a node that had 0 out-degree. Three models, namely the Greedy Model (de Visser and Krug, 2014), the Correlated Fixation Model (Gillespie, 1984) , and the Equal Fixation Model (Weinreich et al., 2006) , were employed in this study to simulate the mutational steps in adaptive trajectories. Under all three models, the probability of fixation of a deleterious or neutral mutation is 0. Considering a mutational trajectory initiated at a node, n i with a fitness value of w i , where n i has M successors, (n 1 , n 2 , . . . n M ) with fitness values of (w 1 , w 2 , . . . w M ). Then the probability that the next mutational step is from n i to n k , where k 2 (1, 2, . . .

The blue line corresponds to the median. The top 0.1% subgraphs with fitness contributions from higher-order epistasis (the bottom 0.1% subgraphs ranked by fraction of variance explained at second order expansion) are shown in red lines. (B) A sequence logo was generated for the quadruple mutants corresponding to the top 0.1% subgraphs with higher-order epistasis. The skewed composition of amino acids indicates that higher-order interactions are enriched among specific amino acid combinations of site 39, 41 and 54.

The amino acids of WT are boxed. Epistasis that cannot be determined due to missing variant is colored in grey.

The size of each basin of attraction is identified by the Greedy Model (see Materials and methods). The area of each node is in proportion to the size of the basin of attraction of the corresponding fitness peak. An edge is drawn between fitness peaks that are separated by a Hamming distance of 2. (B) A possible adaptive path starting from WT (VDGV) to the fitness peak LYGV. (C) The frequency of different types of mutational step are shown. Three models, including the Greedy Model (green), Correlated Fixation Model (blue) and Equal Fixation Model (red), are used to simulate 1000 adaptive paths starting from each variant in the sequence space. All the adaptive paths end at a fitness peak. (D) The distribution of the length of the adaptive path initiated at different starting points. For Correlated Fixation Model and Equal Fixation Model, the length Figure 4 continued on next page reduced from 19L to approximately 6L",
