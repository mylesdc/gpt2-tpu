Knockdown of DHX36 and its adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) by small-interfering RNA in MARC-145 cells significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after PRRSV infection. Further investigation revealed that PRRSV nucleocapsid protein interacted with the N-terminal quadruplex binding domain of DHX36, which in turn augmented nucleocapsid protein-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Taken together, our results suggest that DHX36-MyD88 has a relevant role in the recognition of PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and in the subsequent activation of pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB pathway.",

Recently, the involvement of other DExD/H-box RNA helicases, for instance, DExD/H-box helicase 36 (DHX36), in innate immunity has also been extensively studied (2) (3) (4) . DExD/H-box helicase 36, also termed RNA helicase associated with AU-rich RNA element, was initially characterized as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that demonstrates high affinity for quadruplex (G4) structures in DNA and RNA (5) . DHX36 contains a core helicase domain responsible for ATPbinding/helicase activity and is flanked on either side by N-and C-terminal extensions (5) . Later, DHX36 has been shown to function as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent sensor for herpes simplex virus 1 in the cytosol of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a TIR-domaincontaining adapter-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent sensor in response to influenza and reovirus infection in myeloid dendritic cells (2, 3) . Whether DHX36 can recognize other virus-derived PAMPs except nucleic acids has not been elucidated to date.",

The purpose of this work is to identify whether the intracellular pathogen sensor DHX36 is involved in PRRSV-induced inflammatory response. In this study, we found that the expression levels of DHX36 in cytoplasm increase after PRRSV infection. Knockdown and overexpression analyzes showed that DHX36 is involved in both PRRSV and N protein-induced NF-\u03baB signal activation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that N protein binds to DHX36, both in transfected HEK293T cells and in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. Thus, our studies have illuminated a cellular mechanism responsible for PRRSVassociated inflammatory responses that may contribute to a deeper understanding of the infection and pathogenesis of PRRSV.",

First, we utilized DHX36-specific siRNA to silence DHX36. The knockdown efficiency of the synthesized siRNA-targeting DHX36 (si-DHX36) was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses. Compared with the cells treated with NC siRNA, cells transfected with si-DHX36 significantly decreased DHX36 expression at protein and mRNA levels ( Figure 3A) . Next, we assessed the impact of DHX36 silencing in response to PRRSV stimulation. Poly I:C was used as a positive control. As expected, when DHX36 was knocked down in MARC-145 cells, the poly I:C-induced activation of NF-\u03baB-promoterdependent luciferase activity was less pronounced (Figure 3B) . Similarly, compared to DHX36-knockdown MARC-145 cells, cells transfected with NC siRNA induced high levels of NF-\u03baB activation following stimulation with PRRSV, highlighting the importance of DHX36 for NF-\u03baB signal activation in response to PRRSV infection ( Figure 3B) .",

Two adaptor molecules, TRIF and MyD88, have been reported to be utilized by DHX36 to mediate downstream signaling (2, 3). To further identify which adaptor is utilized by PRRSV to induce NF-\u03baB activation, we again used siRNA to knock down endogenous MyD88 or TRIF and confirmed the knockdown efficiency by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses (Figures 4A,B) . As shown in Figure 4C , compared with NC siRNA, knockdown of MyD88 significantly reduced PRRSVinduced NF-\u03baB activation, but no appreciable change was detected after knockdown of TRIF. We further validated this observation by Western blotting analysis of I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level and P65 phosphorylation. To this end, MARC-145 cells were transfected with DHX36-, MyD88-, and TRIF-specific siRNA or control scrambled siRNA, after which the cells were infected with PRRSV, and cell extracts were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Consistent with the results of the dual-luciferase assay, Western blotting showed that I\u03baB\u03b1 protein degradation and P65 phosphorylation were strongly impaired in both DHX36-and MyD88knockdown cells, whereas these parameters barely changed in TRIF-knockdown cells (Figure 4D) . These results indicate that MyD88 is the key downstream adaptor of DHX36 responsible for PRRSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation.",

We also evaluated the involvement of DHX36 in N protein-induced NF-\u03baB To further confirm NF-\u03baB activation, we examined the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB subunit P65 in cells co-expression of N protein and DHX36. As shown in Figure 6C , the amount of phosphorylated P65 and nuclear P65 protein increased, while total P65 was unaltered in cells coexpressing N protein and DHX36, compared to cells expressing only N protein.

In this study, we demonstrate that the N protein of PRRSV binds to DHX36 in both transfected HEK293T cells and PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. The interactome map of the PRRSV N protein has been examined using a proteomics approach, and several DExD/H-box helicase superfamily proteins, including DDX3X, DDX5, DDX17, DHX9, DHX30, and DHX36, were identified (34, 35) . Consistent with this observation, our work not only validated the interaction between N protein and DHX36 but further showed that the N-terminal domain of DHX36 was responsible for mediating binding of PRRSV N protein. In addition, inhibition of DHX36 expression by specific siRNA impaired N protein-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Our study therefore provides evidence that a virus-derived protein can bind to the cytoplasmic PRR DHX36 and can subsequently stimulate NF-\u03baB activation. During the last decade, several reports have illustrated differential functions of DExD/H-box helicase superfamily proteins in PRRSV infection. For example, overexpression of DDX3X was found to significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells (36) . In addition, it has been shown that DDX5 plays a positive role in the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral nsp9 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 and PAM cells (37) .

Although the roles of DExD/H-box family proteins in viral replication are well documented, their importance in detecting invading virus is just becoming evident. In this regard, DDX19a was discovered to be an RNA sensor that triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 production by detecting PRRSV genomic RNA (4). Thus, both DDX19a-NLRP3-related viral RNA sensing and DHX36-mediated viral N protein recognition might contribute collaboratively to uncontrolled progression of virus-induced inflammation, which culminates in exacerbated pathogenesis and development of pneumonia. DExD/H-box helicase 36 was originally identified as crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity, prevention of abortive transcription, and translation initiation (5, 39, 40) . As an evolutionarily conserved DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase, DHX36 is highly specific for DNA and RNA G4s with N-terminal extension motifs required for quadruplex recognition (5) . This N-terminal domain was also found to be both essential and sufficient for its localization in stress granules, the membraneless RNA-and RNA-binding protein-containing complexes that are transiently assembled in stressful conditions to promote cell survival (41) . Recently, biochemical data have shown that DHX36 and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) form a complex in a dsRNA-dependent manner and facilitate dsRNA binding, phosphorylation, and activation of PKR, processes which are essential for the formation of stress granules (25) . It is noteworthy that stress granule formation is also triggered by PRRSV infection, which in turn facilitates proinflammatory cytokine production (unpublished data). These observations imply that there is some unidentified relationship between PRRSV-triggered stress granule formation and the activation of DHX36 signaling. In addition, Western blots were performed to detect the expression of P65 and p-P65 by coexpression of N protein and the wild-type DHX36 or individual DHX36 mutant. We found that, except the wild-type DHX36, all DHX36 mutants (mutants a, b, c, d, and e) cannot up-regulate the phosphorylation level of P65 when co-expressed with N protein (data not shown). This is possibly because DHX36 mutants a, b, and c lack the C-terminal MyD88-binding domain responsible for downstream signaling activation, while mutants d and e lose the N-terminal domain responsible for binding with PRRSV N protein.",

Consistent with this, it has been shown that the PRRSV N protein can suppress IFN production by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (43) . Among the viral-derived proteins that are involved in PRRSV-induced pathogenesis, identification of the major contributor to severely impaired IFN responses and the massive inflammation in the respiratory tract associated with PRRSV infection, along with dissection of the underlying molecular mechanism, is of critical importance. Although recent studies have revealed that several proteins encoded by the PRRSV genome independently antagonize IFN signaling, only N protein has been widely accepted to possess the ability of activating NF-\u03baB signaling (23) . Thus, the current study sought to identify the mechanisms by which PRRSV N protein activates NF-\u03baB-driven inflammatory responses and identified that DHX36 is involved in N protein-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. In fact, the N protein of PRRSV is a multifunctional protein in addition to its role in packaging viral genomic RNA (9, 50) . Several amino acid motifs on the N protein have been identified not only to be involved in virus replication but are also associated with cellular proteins and signaling pathways (51, 52) , such as translation initiation and RNA post-transcriptional modification (53) (54) (55) . These studies, together with our work, demonstrate the importance of the N protein in the life cycle of Arteriviruses.",

Cell lysates were collected at the indicated time points and the expression of endogenous DHX36 protein was analyzed by Western blot with DHX36-specific antibody. Relative levels of DHX36 in comparison with mock-infected cells are indicated as fold change below the images. Western blot with a specific monoclonal antibody against PRRSV N protein demonstrates PRRSV infection. All blots were also incubated with anti-actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. in the cytoplasm and nucleus (3). To explore the subcellular localization of DHX36 after PRRSV infection, MARC-145 cells were inoculated with PRRSV for 24 h, and indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed with a polyclonal antibody against DHX36. The PRRSV-infected cells were monitored by monoclonal antibody against viral N protein. As shown inFigure 2A, endogenous DHX36 protein was distributed diffusely in both cytoplasm and cell nuclei in mock-infected cells; in contrast, even though some of the DHX36 still resided in the nucleus, PRRSV infection resulted in the accumulation of DHX36 in the cytoplasm.",
