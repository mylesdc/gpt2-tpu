Critical to the succesful application of real-time PCR is careful assay design, reaction optimization and validation to maximize sensitivity and accuracy. In most of the studies published GAPD, ACTB or 18S rRNA have been used as a single reference gene without prior verification of their expression stability. Normalization of the data using unstable controls can result in erroneous conclusions, especially when only one reference gene is used.",

Real-time quantification at the exponential phase is not affected by any reaction components becomming limited in the plateau phase. Although small differences in transcript levels can be measured by endpoint RT-PCR, a lot of optimizations and post-PCR manipulations are required. These optimizations have to be performed for every individual sample, because the RNA expression can vary a lot between individual samples. Therefore, real-time RT-PCR has been recognised as the method of choice for accurate and sensitive quantification of mRNA transcripts [9, 10] . Many studies have now been published where RNA quantification has been assessed in early domestic animal embryos. This technique has the advantage of speed, high throughput and accuracy over a large dynamic range of quantification and is especially suitable when only a small number of cells are available [11] . Several authors [12] [13] [14] have demonstrated the reproducibility of the 2 step SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR reaction by determination of the intraand interassay variation.",

However a number of studies have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels are not constant between different developmental stages and different experimental conditions [17] [18] [19] .

            "text": "It is now generally accepted that transcription levels should be normalized to an invariable internal control gene. Those reference genes are often adapted from the literature and used against a variety of experimental conditions. An ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level among different experimental conditions and at all stages of development. An ontogenic study of several commonly used reference genes showed that their mRNA levels are not stable throughout preimplantation development [19] . If the used reference gene fluctuates between the samples, the subsequent normalization will cause erroneous results [30] . As the biological function of many genes is still unknown, it is difficult to predict how experimental conditions will affect the expression of the putative reference genes. Thus a safer approach is to use the geometric average expression of several genes that show small variance. Vandesompele et al. [21] postulated that gene pairs that have stable expression patterns relative to each other are proper control genes. YWHAZ, GAPD, SDHA and 18S rRNA were found to be the best endogenous control genes in preimplantation embryo samples as represented by their low M values, the marker of gene stability. ACTB was the worst scoring reference gene, in the set of 8 tested reference genes ( Figure 1A ). This is a remarkable result given the fact that in several publications on gene expression analysis in embryos, ACTB was the only reference gene used. However, the differential mRNA expression of ACTB is in accordance with previous reports that prove the upregulation of ACTB during preimplantation embryo development and predict a role for ACTB during blastocyst formation [31] [32] [33] . In previous studies Histone H2A was determined as the most stable reference gene during preimplantation embryo development [8, 19] , but those authors only considered Ct values and did not correct for the amount of input mate- rial. To validate the presumed stable expression of a given control gene, prior knowledge of a reliable measure to normalize this gene in order to remove any nonspecific variation is required. To address this circular problem, Vandesompele et al. [21] developed a gene-stability measure to determine the expression stability of control genes on the basis of non-normalized expression levels. By using this approach, the changing RNA content during the developmental stages was taken into account [34] . Besides geNorm, other programs and strategies are described in literature to select the best reference genes. BestKeeper [35] is an Excel-application also based on pairwise correlation. Normfinder [13] is a model based approach and enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes, but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set.",

This approach relies on the principle that the expression ratio of two perfect reference genes should be identical in all samples, regardless of the experimental condition or cell type. Increasing variation in this ratio corresponds to decreasing expression stability. The program calculates the gene stability measure M by determining the average pair-wise variation between a particular reference gene and all other control genes. Genes with higher M values have greater variation in RNA expression. By stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene and recalculation of the M values, the most stable reference genes are identified. Finally, a normalisation factor (NF) was calculated based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the bestperforming reference genes.",
