In the current study we investigated the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using viral metagenomics. Five (near) complete RVA genomes were obtained. A single RVA strain showed a partial relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain, whereas the other strains were completely novel. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed significant variability, indicating the occurrence of frequent reassortment events. Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that most of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel consensus screening primers were developed and used to screen samples from infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population. Although RVA infections were identified in 36% of the infants, there was no evidence of zoonosis. This study identified multiple novel bat RVA strains, but further epidemiological studies in humans will have to assess if these viruses have the potential to cause gastroenteritis in humans.",

The VP7 gene of BatLy03 was 96% identical (on the nucleotide (nt) level, supplementary data S1) to the Kenyan bat RVA strain KE4852 counterpart, which had been previously classified as a G25 genotype (Fig. 2 ). BatLi10 and BatLi09 were 100% identical and also clustered closely with strain BatLy17 (92% similar). This cluster was only distantly related to all other known VP7 RVA sequences as well as to strain BatLi08, which also formed a unique long branch in the phylogenetic tree. Both clusters only show similarities below 74% with established genotypes (Fig. 2) . The VP7 of these 4 strains (BatLi10, BatLi09, BatLy17 and BatLi08) did not belong to any of the established RVA G-genotypes, according to the established criteria 6 , and were assigned genotypes G30 (BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17) and G31 (BatLi08) by the RCWG. For VP4, VP1 and VP3, all five Cameroonian bat RVAs strains were distantly related to other known RVA strains, including the Kenyan and Chinese RVA strains and were therefore assigned to novel genotypes according to the RCWG classification criteria (Fig. 3) . The VP4 gene of strains BatLi08, BatLi09 and BatLi10 (representatives of the novel genotype P[42]) were almost 99-100% identical to each other and only 56-75% identical to any other P-genotype. That of strains BatLy03 and BatLy17 had 29% nt dissimilarity to each other and their nt identity ranged from 60-76% with other P-genotypes and therefore were assigned the genotypes P[43] and P[47], respectively. The VP1 and VP3 genes of BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17 were nearly identical (nt identity range 99-100%) and clustered together but distinct from other established R and M-genotypes, thereby representing the new genotypes R15 and M14, respectively (Fig. 3) . The VP1 and VP3 genes of BatLy03 were only distantly related to the other four Cameroonian bat RVAs (68-77% nt identity) and are the sole member of the newly assigned genotypes R16 and M15, respectively (Fig. 3) . The VP6, VP2, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments of 4 of our strains (BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17) were distantly related to their counterparts of other mammalian and avian RVAs Fig. 4) . For all the 4 strains, these gene segments clustered together and were 99-100% identical to each other and consequently they constitute new genotypes for the different gene segments (I22, C15 N15, T17 and H17, respectively). The VP6, VP2, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments of BatLy03 phylogenetically clustered together with the Kenyan bat RVA strain KE4852 in the previously established I15, C8, N8, T11 and H10 genotypes, respectively (Fig. 4) . For NSP1, the Cameroonian bat strains BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17 clustered closely together (98-100% nucleotide sequence identity) in the novel genotype A25, and showed only 67% nucleotide similarity to strain BatLy03 (A26). These 5 new NSP1 gene segments were only 42-45% identical to that of the most closely related established NSP1 genotype A13 and A14 (from cow) (Fig. 5) . The NSP4 gene segments of all the 5 RVAs discovered in this study were quite divergent to those of other known bat rotaviruses (at most 69% nucleotide sequence identity) and other RVAs (approximately 45-68% nucleotide similarity) forming two distinct clusters. The NSP4 gene segments of strains BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy03 (genotype E22) were 100% identical but all were 37-38% divergent from that of BatLy03 (E23, Fig. 5 ).",

Several different primer pairs are currently being used to detect human RVA VP7 and VP4 gene segments, to determine the G-and P-genotypes using sequencing or multiplex PCR assays [21] [22] [23] [24] . In order to find out if the currently used human RVA screening primers would detect the bat RVA strain from this study in case of zoonosis, we compared these primers with their corresponding sequences in the respective gene segments (Table 2 and Supplementary data S2). Overall, the similarity percentages for the VP7 forward and reverse primer between the bat RVA sequences and the human primers were 57.1-100% and 63.2-95%, respectively. For VP4, the percentage similarity ranged from 63.6-94.4% and 76.2-85.7% for the forward and reverse primers, respectively. VP7 forward primers Beg9, sBeg9 and 9Con1-L showed a (near) perfect match with BatLy03-G25, whereas strain BatLi08-G31 and BatLy17-G30 (first 6 nt are missing for this strain), showed up to 10 and 4 nucleotide mismatches at the 3\u2032 end of the primers, respectively. VP7 forward primer 9con1-L showed a perfect match with all the genotypes (G25, G30 and G31). Considering the VP7 reverse primers EndA, VP7-Rdeg, End9 and RVG9, BatLy03-G25 did not show a perfect match as there were 4, 1, 4 and 2 mutations, respectively. The mismatches with EndA, VP7-Rdeg and RVG9 were near the middle or at the 5\u2032 end of the primer, whereas 2 of those of End9 were close to the 3\u2032 end. Comparing the same VP7 reverse primers with strain BatLi08-G31 and BatLi09-G30 also showed mismatches. For EndA and VP7-Rdeg maximum 2 mismatches are located in the middle or near the 5\u2032 -end, whereas for End9 and RVG, there were multiple mismatches of which 2 and 7 mismatches, respectively were right at the 3\u2032 -end. For VP4 forward primer VP4- Additionally, to determine if any of these bat RVAs could cross species and infect humans, we designed primers (RVA-VP6_40F and RVA-VP6_1063R) from an alignment of both human and bat RVA VP6 segments to screen 25 diarrheic infant samples (infants living around the same region where the bat samples were collected). Thirty-six percent of human samples were positive for RVA, however, none of them was of bat RVA origin. They all possessed the typical human genotype I1 and were 99% identical to the Gambian, Senegalese, Belgian and Brazilian Wa-like G1P [8] (Table 3) . Screening human samples for these bat RVAs indicated no interspecies transmissions and primer comparison showed that not all the strains can be picked up with the currently used screening primers. ",

Using an unbiased viral metagenomics approach, we identified 5 divergent novel bat RVA strains, 4 of which were genetically similar to each other. The fifth strain was related to the Kenyan bat strain. Interestingly, all these RVAs were identified in adult (both female and male) straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) which is in contrast to human and other animals whereby RVA (symptomatic) infections occur mostly in juveniles 1 . Also, diarrhea or other obvious signs of sickness were not noticed in these bats. This may suggest that bats may undergo active virus replication and shedding without obvious clinical signs 25 , which potentially could increase human exposure.",

Nucleotide comparison between the sequence of human RVA screening primers for VP7 (Beg9, sBeg9, 9Con1-L, EndA, VP7-Rdeg, End9 and RVG9) and VP4 (VP4-1-17F, Con3 and Con2) with their corresponding region of the new bat RVA genotype. Black shaded nucleotides indicate dissimilar nucleotides between a strain segment sequence and primer and bold numbers at the beginning and end of sequence indicate nucleotide positions for different strains. For clarity the reverse complement sequence of the reverse primers is used for comparison with bat RVA sequences. Chinese RVA strains are genetically quite conserved (all segments of both strains have the same genotype except for their VP4 gene). Based on genome comparisons of Chinese bat and partial human RVA strains from Thailand (CMH079 and CMH222) and India (69 M, 57 M and mcs60), Xia and colleagues speculated that Asian bat RVAs may have crossed the host species barrier to humans on a number of occasions 19 . In addition, the unusual equine strain E3198 26 shares the same genotype constellation with either MYAS33 and/or MSLH14 in all segments except VP6. This data therefore suggests that this equine RVA strain most likely share a common ancestor with Asian bat RVAs. Furthermore, the genotype constellations of these Asian bat RVA (Table 3 ) are reminiscent to the Au-1-like genotype backbone of feline/canine-like RVA strains, as well as to the genotype constellation of two unusual simian RVAs (RRV and TUCH) 27 , suggesting that interspecies transmissions might have also occurred in the distant past. Moreover, an unusual Ecuadorean human RVA, Ecu534 28 is closely related to bat sequences from Brazil recently submitted to GenBank. Similarly, possible interspecies transmission trends were also suggested by He and colleagues 18 between bovine strain RVA/Cow-wt/IND/RUBV3/2005/G3P [3] and the bat strain MSLH14.",

Comparisons (Table 2 and Supplementary data S2) of these primers with the corresponding sequences showed that the primer combination 9Con1-L and VP7-Rdeg 21, 22 , would most likely detect both G25 and G31 RVA strains. Also, the combination of either Beg9 or sBeg9 with End9 or RVG9 24 might be successful in amplifying G25, but the same combinations might not be able to pick up the novel G31 and G30 genotypes in PCR screening assays. Furthermore, the primer combination Beg9/sBeg9 and EndA 29 are likely to detect G25, but will be unsuccessful in case of G30 and G31 especially if the forward primer Beg9 is used. Considering VP4, both forward primers, VP4-1-17F 30 and Con3 23 in combination with the reverse primer Con2 will be sub-optimal in detecting any of the P genotypes. Generally, with the exception of strain G25, detection of most of the bat strains will be sub-optimal or not successful at all for the different available primer combinations.

Interestingly, 36% of human samples were positive, however, none of these were positive for bat RVAs. All were of the typical human RVA genotype I1 and therefore there is no evidence for interspecies transmissions of bat RVA to humans. However, this result is not conclusive as only a small sample size was considered here. Sampling a larger number of subjects and from different localities around the region might result in more conclusive answers with respect to the zoonotic potential of these bat RVA strains.",

Their genotype constellation differs markedly from the Kenyan straw-colored fruit bat strain (KE4852). Although this strain showed a unique genotype backbone, some of its segments were similar to some human and other animal RVAs 17 .

Captured bats were retrieved from the traps and held in paper sacks for 10-15 min, allowing enough time for the excretion of fresh fecal boluses. Sterile disposable spatulas were used to retrieve feces from the paper sacks, and placed into tubes containing 1 ml of universal transport medium (UTM, Copan Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy). Labeled samples were put on ice and then transferred to the Molecular and cell biology laboratory, Biotechnology Unit, University of Buea, Cameroon and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, until they were shipped to the Laboratory of Viral Metagenomics, Leuven, Belgium where they were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. Each captured bat was assessed to determine species, weight (g), forearm length (mm), sex, reproductive state, and age. All captured bats were then marked by hair clipping to facilitate identification of recaptures, and released afterwards. Trained zoologists used morphological characteristics to determine the species of the bats before they were released. No clinical signs of disease were noticed in any of these bats.",

The filtrate was then treated with a cocktail of Benzonase (Novagen, Madison, USA) and Micrococcal Nuclease (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h to digest free-floating nucleic acids. Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions but without addition of carrier RNA to the lysis buffer. First and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed and random PCR amplification for 17 cycles were performed using a Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA) Kit procedure (Sigma-Aldrich), with a denaturation temperature of 95 \u00b0C instead of 72 \u00b0C to allow the denaturation of dsDNA and dsRNA. WTA products were purified with MSB Spin PCRapace spin columns (Stratec, Berlin, Germany) and the libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing using the NexteraXT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). A cleanup after library synthesis was performed using a 1.8 ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Nyon, Switzerland) 33 . Sequencing of the samples was performed on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) for 300 cycles (2 \u00d7 150 bp paired ends). Partial sequences were completed using RT-PCRs with specific primers (Supplementary S4). For gene segments lacking the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of the ORF the single primer amplification method (Primers in Supplementary S4) was used as described previously 34 .
