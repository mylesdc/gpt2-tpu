TNF\u03b1 was the first cytokine to be fully validated as a therapeutic target in RA (1) . TNF\u03b1 inhibitors (TNFi) have revolutionized treatment of RA and have been used in over a million patients worldwide (2) . Despite the good clinical response observed in many patients, TNF\u03b1 blockade does not offer a curative treatment; approximately one-third of patients do not respond and loss of efficacy is frequently observed (3) . Importantly, it is currently not possible to predict which patients will respond to TNFi therapy. In addition, in some inflammatory diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (4, 5) and multiple sclerosis (6), TNFi have not shown clinical efficacy. Furthermore, and paradoxically, some patients treated with TNFi develop de novo autoimmune diseases (7) . These observations indicate that the underlying mechanisms relating to TNF blockade in humans are incompletely understood and require further exploration. The effects of TNFi are more wide-ranging than simply neutralizing the biological activity of soluble and membrane-bound TNF\u03b1 (mTNF\u03b1). For example, by binding mTNF\u03b1, anti-TNF mAbs can mediate cell death by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (8) (9) (10) (11) . TNF\u03b1 inhibitors have also been shown to affect downstream cytokine pathways (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) (2), modulate APC function (12) , and promote regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion (13) (14) (15) although opposite findings regarding the latter have been reported (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

It was shown both cross-sectionally and longitudinally that inflammatory arthritis patients on TNFi therapy have an increased frequency of peripheral blood (PB) IL-10 + CD4 + T cells. These in vivo findings were reproduced in vitro by coculturing CD4 + T cells from healthy donors with autologous CD14 + monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb, in the presence of different TNFi drugs (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, or certolizumab) (20) .

Time course experiments were performed to assess the kinetics of IL-10 expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. PBMC were cultured with anti-CD3 mAb in the absence or presence of adalimumab, and the frequencies of IL-10 expressing cells were analyzed 4-120 h after stimulation. The data show that early after TCR stimulation (18-24 h) the frequencies of IL-10 expressing cells within CD4 + and CD8 + T cells increased rapidly irrespective of the presence of TNF blockade. However, at later time points (from 42 to 120 h), higher frequencies of IL-10 + cells were sustained within CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the presence of TNF blockade (Figure 3) . These experiments suggest that TNF blockade maintains, rather than directly induces, an IL-10 + phenotype in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells following TCR stimulation.",

We investigated whether blockade of additional pro-inflammatory pathways could promote IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells. Blockade of IL-17A did not enhance the frequencies of IL-10 + cells in any of the CD4 + T cell populations tested (Figure 4A) . Blockade of IFN\u03b3 did not affect the percentage of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells, or within IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1 + subpopulations, but led to modestly increased frequencies of IL-10 + expressing cells within the IL-17 + population, although this effect was much weaker than the effect of TNF blockade in parallel cultures ( Figure 4A) . Addition of tocilizumab (IL-6R blockade) or abatacept (CTLA4-Ig, which blocks CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation), both of which are biologic drugs routinely used in the clinic to treat rheumatoid arthritis, did not increase IL-10 + frequencies in CD4 + T cells, IL-17 + , IFN\u03b3 + , or TNF\u03b1 + CD4 + T cell subpopulations (Figure 4B) . To determine whether blockade of these pathways might regulate IL-10 expression with different kinetics to TNF blockade, IL-10 + frequencies were analyzed within both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at different time points in anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC cultures exposed to these antibodies or drugs. IL-10 + CD4 + and IL-10 + CD8 + T cell frequencies were not regulated at any time point by blockade of IL-17, IFN\u03b3, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation ( Figure  S5 in Supplementary Material). Blockade of IL-1R1 in CD4 + T cell/monocyte cocultures resulted in a significantly increased proportion of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells and within IL-17 + , IFN\u03b3 + , or TNF\u03b1 + subpopulations ( Figure 4B) . However, this effect was not replicated in either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in whole PBMC cultures ( Figure S5 in Supplementary Material), indicating that the capacity of IL-1 blockade to regulate IL-10 expression may be dependent on the in vitro culture conditions. Together these data indicate that IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells can be regulated by blocking TNF\u03b1 signaling, but not by blocking IFN\u03b3, IL-17, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation, at least in vitro.",

Our previous work indicated that in three donors, MACS-depletion of CD4 + CD25 + cells did not impair the anti-TNF-mediated increase in IL-10 + frequencies within IL-17 + CD4 + T cells and that no increase in FOXP3 + cell frequencies was apparent upon TNF blockade (20) . To investigate this further, MACS-isolated CD4 + T cells were FACS sorted to very high purity (>99%) to yield either total CD4 + T cells or effector CD4 + CD25-CD127 + T cells (Teff; depleted of CD25 high CD127 low Treg). These cells were then cultured with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs in the absence of monocytes, or placed in coculture with monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb, in the absence or presence of adalimumab. Our data show that TNF blockade still resulted in increased frequencies of IL-10-expressing cells in effector T cells in the absence of CD25 high CD127 low Tregs (Figure 6 ). Together these data indicate that TNF blockade regulates IL-10 expression directly in CD4 + effector T cells and does not require the presence of CD14 + monocytes or CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low Tregs. (a) CD4 + T cells (n = 6) or CD45RO + enriched CD4 + T cells (n = 2) were cocultured 1:1 with autologous monocytes in the presence of anti-CD3 (100 ng/ml), without (control) or with anti-TNF mAb (adalimumab, 1 \u03bcg/ml) or neutralizing antibodies to IFN\u03b3 or IL-17 (10 \u03bcg/ml) or the appropriate isotype control antibodies (mIgG2a and mIgG2b, respectively). (B) CD45RO + enriched CD4 + T cells (n = 9) were cocultured 1:1 with autologous monocytes in the presence of anti-CD3 (100 ng/ml), without (control) or with anti-TNF mAb (adalimumab, 1 \u03bcg/ml), tocilizumab (50 \u00b5g/ml), abatacept (5 \u00b5g/ml) or anti-IL-1R1-blocking Ab (2 \u03bcg/ml).

In support of our findings that TNF blockade can exert its effects on CD4 + T cells in the absence of monocytes, we did not find evidence for a role of the monocyte-derived anti-inflammatory mediator IL-27 (32) in mediating IL-10 expression in the context of TNF blockade. This was demonstrated by the findings that TNF blockade did not induce IL-27 secretion, rhIL-27 enhanced IL-10 secretion but did not result in increased percentages of IL-10 + CD4 + T cells, and IL-27 blockade did not impair the increased IL-10 + CD4 + T cell frequencies brought about by TNF blockade ( Figure S6 in Supplementary Material).",

Addition of rhIL-10 even decreased the percentage of IL-10 + cells in total CD4 + T cells and TNF\u03b1 + CD4 + T cells (Figure 7B) . The biological activity of the recombinant IL-10 was validated by culturing freshly isolated monocytes with 0, 10, or 100 ng/ml rhIL-10 for 20 h and confirming that rhIL-10 addition resulted in increased CD14 and CD163 and reduced HLA-DR expression by flow cytometry, in accordance with previous studies (33, 34) (n = 2, data not shown). We next investigated the regulation of IL-10 in response to rhIL-10 in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells using whole PBMC cultures assessed for IL-10 expression over a 5-day time course (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). We found that at earlier time points (18-24 h) , rhIL-10 addition reduced IL-10 + CD4 + T cell frequencies (n = 6, p = 0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), while at later time points (66-72 and 114-120 h), rhIL-10 slightly increased IL-10 + CD4 + T cell frequencies (n = 6, p = 0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). IL-10 + CD8 + T cell frequencies remained very low throughout, regardless of rhIL-10 addition. Together, these data indicate that IL-10 signaling contributes in part to TNF blockade-mediated regulation of IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells, but that other factors also play a role. The effects of exogenous IL-10 on regulating IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells appear to be dependent on both time and in vitro culture conditions.",

Data show frequencies of IL-10 + cells within the total CD4 + T cell population or within IL-17 + , IFN\u03b3 + , or TNF\u03b1 + subpopulations and were assessed by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (ns p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). T cells with tolerogenic DCs favored the development of IL-10 + CD4 + T cells (40) . Thus, TNFi-mediated regulation of IL-10 in CD4 + T cells has been indicated by a growing number of in vitro and ex vivo studies. The presence of IL-10-expressing CD8 + T cells has been reported in several mouse models of infection, including acute influenza infection (41) , chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (42) , and coronavirus-induced encephalitis (43) . Furthermore, IL-10 + CD8 + T cells have been found in patients with HIV (44) and chronic hepatitis C infection (45) . IL-10 expression in CD8 + T cells can be induced by IL-4, either alone (46) or in combination with IL-12 (47) , or dexamethasone (48) . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that TNF blockade can regulate IL-10 expression in CD8 + T cells.",

Our data suggest however that the capacity of TNF blockade to affect IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells is not dependent on IL-27. In agreement with other work on human T cells (51, 52) , we found that addition of recombinant IL-27 to anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated CD4 + T cells resulted in increased IL-10 secretion, although this was not strictly dosedependent. However, in contrast to these other studies, which used na\u00efve CD4 + T cells, our analysis of intracellular cytokine expression did not demonstrate increased IL-10 + CD4 + T cell frequencies after 3 days in culture with IL-27. This is possibly Anti-TNF Maintains IL-10 + CD4 + /CD8 + T Cells Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 157 due to different kinetics of IL-10 expression in a bulk CD4 + T cell population. It is of note that although in CD4 + T cell/monocyte cocultures IL-10 blockade led to reduced IL-10 + frequencies in both the presence and absence of TNF blockade, IL-10 addition by itself was not sufficient to drive IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells. These data are in line with previous work showing that IL-10 is necessary but not sufficient to enhance development of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells following in vitro differentiation in the presence of vitamin D3 plus dexamethasone (53) . However, when added to anti-CD3-stimulated whole PBMC cultures, rhIL-10 did slightly increase IL-10 + CD4 + T cell frequencies after 3 and 5 days in culture, indicating that the regulation of IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells is dependent on in vitro culture conditions.",

This study indicates that a potentially immunoregulatory IL-10 + phenotype is broadly maintained in effector T cells following exposure to TNF blockade, which may represent an underappreciated mechanism of action for this widely used therapeutic strategy. We previously provided evidence that the IL-10 secreted by IL-17 + CD4 + T cells following TNF blockade is biologically active (20) ; however, further work is required to investigate whether the increase in IL-10 + frequencies across different T cell subpopulations is functionally relevant in the context of inflammatory disease. Additional insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms via which TNF blockade maintains IL-10 expression could identify potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. aUThOr cOnTriBUTiOns CR, LD, and VF designed and performed experiments and analyzed and interpreted data.
