            "text": "Picornaviruses induce dramatic rearrangements of endomembranes in the cells that they infect to produce dedicated platforms for viral replication. These structures, termed replication organelles (ROs), have been well characterized for the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. However, it is unknown whether the diverse RO morphologies associated with enterovirus infection are conserved among other picornaviruses. Here, we use serial electron tomography at different stages of infection to assess the three-dimensional architecture of ROs induced by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of the Cardiovirus genus of the family of picornaviruses that is distantly related. Ultrastructural analyses revealed connections between early single-membrane EMCV ROs and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), establishing the ER as a likely donor organelle for their formation. These early single-membrane ROs appear to transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) as infection progresses. Both single-and double-membrane structures were found to support viral RNA synthesis, and progeny viruses accumulated in close proximity, suggesting a spatial association between RNA synthesis and virus assembly. Further, we explored the role of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a critical host factor for both enterovirus and cardiovirus replication that has been recently found to expedite enterovirus RO formation rather than being strictly required. By exploiting an EMCV escape mutant, we found that low-PI4P conditions could also be overcome for the formation of cardiovirus ROs. Collectively, our data show that despite differences in the membrane source, there are striking similarities in the biogenesis, morphology, and transformation of cardiovirus and enterovirus ROs, which may well extend to other picornaviruses. IMPORTANCE Like all positive-sense RNA viruses, picornaviruses induce the rearrangement of host cell membranes to form unique structures, or replication organelles (ROs), that support viral RNA synthesis. Here, we investigate the architecture and biogenesis of cardiovirus ROs and compare them with those induced by enteroviruses, members of the well-characterized picornavirus genus Enterovirus. The origins and dynamic morphologies of cardiovirus ROs are revealed using electron tomography, which points to the endoplasmic reticulum as the donor organelle usurped to produce single-membrane tubules and vesicles that transform into double-membrane vesicles. We show that PI4P, a critical lipid for cardiovirus and enterovirus replication, is not strictly required for the formation of cardiovirus ROs, as functional ROs with typical morphologies are formed under phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type III alpha (PI4KA) inhibition in cells infected with an escape mutant.

KEYWORDS cardiovirus, picornavirus, replication organelles, electron tomography, membrane structure, PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type III alpha, electron microscopy, phospholipids T he cardioviruses comprise an important genus of the Picornaviridae family of positive-sense RNA (\u03e9RNA) viruses. The type species Cardiovirus A, or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), ostensibly infects mice but is capable of infecting a range of mammals, including humans. Severe disease in wild or farm animals occurs primarily in swine (1, 2) , but concerns for human safety have followed from studies demonstrating the potential for pig-to-human EMCV transmission during organ xenotransplantation (3, 4) , which will become more imminent as the technique matures. The Cardiovirus B species is represented by Theiler's murine encephalomyocarditis virus (TMEV), the study of which has led to critical contributions to our understanding of demyelinating diseases (reviewed in reference 5). Unlike TMEV, the closely related Saffold virus is capable of infecting humans. Saffold virus was discovered only recently in a patient with a fever of unknown origin (6) but appears to be widespread and commonly found in coinfections with other viruses. Among these coinfecting viruses are the enteroviruses (7, 8) , another genus of picornaviruses that includes poliovirus, the coxsackieviruses, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses A71 and D68. Although the consequences of enterovirus and Saffold virus infections in coinfected patients are entwined, there are suggestions that Saffold virus could cause or contribute to diseases as diverse as gastroenteritis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (reviewed in reference 9), which are typically associated with enterovirus infections.",

            "text": "Understanding the conserved requirements for picornavirus replication is an important strategy for developing broadly acting antiviral therapies. Currently, vaccines are available to prevent infections with hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, and enterovirus 71 (EV71) (available only in China), but there are no approved antiviral therapies to treat picornavirus infections. Substantial efforts have been invested in developing directly acting antivirals that target viral proteins, but the spectrum of antiviral activity of these agents is limited (10) (11) (12) . Another strategy, for which interest has been growing in recent years, is the development of inhibitors targeting host factors that are conserved among different genera (13) . One host factor required for the replication of both enteroviruses and cardioviruses is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). Cellular production of PI4P is orchestrated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks), which reside in various subcellular compartments and generate local pools of PI4P (reviewed in references 14 and 15) . Enteroviruses rely upon the III beta class of PI4K (PI4KB) (16, 17) , which predominantly localizes to the Golgi apparatus, while cardioviruses require the largely endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based III alpha class of PI4K (PI4KA) (18) . Interestingly, as with cardioviruses and enteroviruses, PI4P is also required by the more distantly related hepatitis C virus (HCV), which depends upon PI4KA for its replication (19) .",

            "text": "A role for PI4P in expediting the formation of enterovirus replication organelles (ROs) has recently been described (20) , which could in part explain its importance during viral replication. ROs are virus-induced membrane rearrangements formed during infections of all eukaryote-infecting \u03e9RNA viruses. These structures serve as a hub for viral replication in the cell, and their unique properties are believed to confer intrinsic benefits on the viruses that generate them. The expansion of membranes that support the viral RNA synthesis machinery may increase replication efficiency, while the unique morphology of some ROs could serve to compartmentalize this process or its products and limit host innate immune sensing. The three-dimensional (3D) morphology of enterovirus ROs is well characterized. Early in infection, enteroviruses induce the formation of single-membrane tubular ROs that gradually transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multilamellar vesicles over the course of infection (21, 22) . Our understanding of cardiovirus ROs, however, is more limited. Different studies have identified single-or double-membrane structures using two-dimensional (2D) electron microscopy (EM) of chemically fixed samples (23) (24) (25) , and it is unclear whether these disparate observations reflect differences in sample preparation or truly distinct structures, perhaps found at different stages of infection. It remains to be established how membrane modifications arise and develop across cardiovirus infection, what their 3D morphology is, which structures are capable of supporting RNA synthesis, and, furthermore, whether PI4KA plays a role in cardiovirus RO formation.",

Samples were prepared using high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution (HPF-FS) as an alternative to chemical fixation, which better preserves structures sensitive to artifacts. We provide evidence that early EMCV ROs consist of singlemembrane tubules (SMTs) and vesicles (SMVs) that emerge from the ER. These singlemembrane structures, which arise during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, appear to serve as the primary platform for genome replication. However, doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs), which largely emerge later in infection, were also capable of supporting RNA synthesis. Remarkably, putative transition states between singlemembrane tubules and DMVs were found that mirror the transformation intermediates observed for enterovirus ROs (21) . This chronological progression of RO morphology contextualizes the previous observations of single-or double-membrane EMCV ROs and represents a striking parallel between cardiovirus and enterovirus DMV formation that may represent a conserved mechanism among picornaviruses. Given this cohesion in RO morphology between enteroviruses and EMCV, we then investigated whether PI4KA plays a role in the formation of EMCV ROs, as PI4KB does for enterovirus ROs (20) . To this end, we studied the effects of PI4KA inhibition on an EMCV mutant that harbors a single substitution in its 3A protein (3A-A32V), which confers resistance to PI4KA inhibitors (26) . Interestingly, PI4KA inhibition neither affected RO morphology nor significantly delayed RO formation. This indicates that, similarly to enteroviruses, a lack of high PI4P levels does not pose an unsurmountable barrier for cardiovirus RO formation.",

We first set out to determine the relationship between EMCV replication and the emergence of ROs. Samples for quantitative PCR (qPCR), viral titer determination, immunofluorescence analysis, and electron microscopy (EM) (chemical fixation) were generated within a single experiment. HeLa cells infected with EMCV (strain Mengovirus) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 were processed every hour up to 9 h postinfection (hpi) for qPCR of viral RNA and for the determination of viral titer. Samples for immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) analyses were fixed between 3 and 9 hpi. While data from these chemically fixed EM samples were assessed to quantify the emergence of ROs, representative images are presented from a subsequent experiment using an improved sample preparation method (highpressure freezing and freeze substitution) that more faithfully preserves RO morphology. The exponential phase of RNA synthesis spanned 3 to 6 hpi, while the increase in viral titer lagged by~2 h (Fig. 1A) . These RNA replication dynamics aligned well with increasing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) immunofluorescence signal, which provides a secondary indication of viral replication. The first fluorescent signal was detected at 4 hpi, and levels increased steadily each hour before reaching a plateau at 7 hpi. Between 4 and 5 hpi, dsRNA signal was found at small foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm, which became larger and more clustered as infection progressed (Fig. 1B) .",

One drawback of 2D EM cell section analysis is the similarity in cross section between vesicles and tubules running perpendicular to the section plane. Additionally, features like membrane connections or small openings may be obscured by the superposition of structures in a 2D projection image. To more unambiguously characterize the morphology of EMCV ROs, cells at early and late stages of infection were prepared for electron tomography (ET). Tomograms from serial cell sections of the same region of interest were combined to form large 3D volumes. Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles \u00ae Single-membrane structures identified in the 2D analysis at early times postinfection were found to comprise a mixed population of single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) and single-membrane tubules (SMTs) (Fig. 3A , red and blue, respectively; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). Unlike the tubules formed during enterovirus infections, EMCV SMTs did not form tightly packed clusters. Both SMVs and SMTs were smooth-membrane structures and were frequently found connected to rough ER (green) by neck-like membrane connections ( Fig. 3B and C, arrowheads), like the ER-derived ROs of nidoviruses (27) (28) (29) and HCV (30) . In contrast, DMVs, which were predominantly found at late stages of infection, appeared in all instances as separate compartments, with no membrane connections to other structures (Fig. 4A , yellow; Movie S2). Some DMVs seemed to be partially enwrapped by additional cisternae late in infection (Fig. 4B , purple), to form multilamellar structures. Virus particles were also detectable in the EM data as dense hexagonal profiles of~25 nm (Fig. 4C , arrowhead), which were frequently found in the cytosol within 30 nm of ROs (Fig. S1 ). These particles (Fig. 4D , black arrowhead) were distinguishable from ribosomes (Fig. 4D , white arrowheads) by their symmetry and well-defined edges. A closer spatial association was found between virus particles and RO membranes (SMVs, SMTs, or DMVs) than between randomly generated coordinates and RO membranes (Fig. S1 , P \u03fd 0.001). This could reflect localized clustering of virions following their formation or a spatial connection between RNA synthesis and virion assembly.",

            "text": "Ultrastructural investigations of enterovirus ROs have revealed putative transition structures that may represent the transformation of SMTs into DMVs. This process appears to involve the pairing of membrane tubules to form flattened cisternae, which curve to enwrap a small volume of cytosol, ultimately forming an open DMV in a vase-like configuration. The opening then seals to form a complete, closed DMV (21, 22) . Similar structures were found in tomograms of EMCV-infected cells, including paired and highly curved tubules (Fig. 5A , i and ii, white arrowheads), which could represent an early stage of DMV formation from SMTs, and DMVs with small openings (Fig. 5A, iii, arrowhead) . Tubular extensions of the outer membranes of DMVs were also found (Fig. 5B , indicated by white arrowheads in consecutive sections) that could represent the partial transformation of SMTs to DMVs. Supporting this idea, similar electron-dense material was observed both in the lumen of single-membrane structures (Fig. 5A , black arrowheads) and within the intermembrane space created by these tubular extensions (Fig. 5B, black arrowhead) . To further examine the possibility of a single-to double-membrane structure transformation, the surface areas of SMVs, SMTs, and DMVs were estimated using the measured average sizes for each structure (Fig. 5C,  top) . These figures provide a guide as to whether SMTs or SMVs are likely candidate precursor structures for DMVs (as described in reference 21) as, unless other lipid sources contribute to DMV membranes, any precursor structure should have at least Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles \u00ae the same surface area as the DMV that forms from it. The estimated surface areas generated allow for a scenario where DMVs are formed by SMTs (Fig. 5C , bottom) and are compatible with the possibility that some (smaller) DMVs could also be derived from SMVs. In this scenario, the multilamellar vesicles seen at late time points may arise from SMTs that enwrap or partially enwrap existing DMVs, rather than enwrapping the cytosol to form a new DMV. DMVs were occasionally found to contain virions in samples analyzed at 7 hpi (pooled data from four tomograms; example shown in Fig. 5D ) but at a low frequency (7% of 68 DMVs), and particles within DMVs represented a small fraction of total virus particles detected (2% of 339 particles). An enwrapping mechanism of SMT-to-DMV transformation could explain the presence of virus particles within a subset of DMVs, as virions may be enclosed by chance during the process.",

In addition to facilitating efficient polyprotein processing (20, (33) (34) (35) , PI4KB accelerates the formation of enterovirus ROs (20) .

Together, these results indicate that the 3A-A32V substitution does not affect RO development or the RO general architecture. PI4KA inhibition under A1 treatment led to a more clustered, perinuclear dsRNA signal compared to uninhibited infections with EMCV 3A-A32V or wt EMCV (Fig. 7A) (26) . Despite this different staining pattern under PI4KA inhibition, the morphology of ROs and time postinfection at which ROs were first detected were not affected. EMCV 3A-A32V infection under PI4KA inhibition produced single-and doublemembrane cardiovirus ROs (Fig. 7B , left, white arrowheads and asterisks, respectively), typically in proximity to the ER (black arrowheads). Importantly, while the clustered dsRNA signal found under inhibition partially localized in the perinuclear Golgi region (Fig. S3) , connections between single-membrane ROs and the ER were still found (Fig. 7B , right, white arrowheads), and ROs produced under PI4KA inhibition also retained their ability to support RNA synthesis (Fig. 7C) .

Interestingly, while enteroviruses invariably produce SMTs early in infection (21, 22) , also in HeLa cells (22) , EMCV produced both SMTs and SMVs. These structures were of different sizes and did not form packed clusters like the SMTs of enteroviruses. Many of the SMTs and SMVs visualized at early stages of infection were also found connected to the ER, providing compelling evidence that cardiovirus ROs are ER derived. This finding is supported by the reported reliance of cardioviruses on ER-associated proteins like PI4KA and the observed colocalization of calreticulin and RO-associated viral proteins (18) . Unlike cardioviruses, enteroviruses depend on Golgi apparatus-based proteins like PI4KB and GBF1 (16, 17, 36) and likely utilize Golgi membranes to generate their ROs. Interestingly, membrane connections between donor organelle and enterovirus ROs were not detected in the tomography studies (21, 22) , suggesting that the process of initial enterovirus RO budding and release from the donor organelle is rapid compared to that of cardioviruses.",

Given that viral replication is likely to occur on the cytosolic face of early single-membrane ROs (37, 38) , the interior of open DMVs could represent a shielded environment for replication at later stages of infection, with access to the cytosol for virion packing and/or export. A similar enwrapping mechanism could also underlie the formation of the sparse doublemembrane structures among abundant single-membrane structures identified in 2D EM investigations of foot-and-mouth disease virus infection (genus Aphthovirus) (39) and may represent the means by which DMVs form during infections with Picornaviridae more broadly. Evidence for a similar mechanism for DMV biogenesis has been presented for the arterivirus equine arteritis virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (order Nidovirales), which in this case would occur not through single-membrane intermediate ROs but by direct pairing and curving of the ER membranes (40, 41) . While this enwrapping mechanism could represent a general route for DMV RO formation in \u03e9RNA viruses, it is intriguing that DMV formation is possible both via enwrapping of Golgi apparatus-or ER-derived single-membrane ROs in the case of picornaviruses and via direct enwrapping of cytosol by ER membranes in the case of nidoviruses. The formation of DMVs from these diverse progenitor membranes could suggest that their development depends primarily on viral machinery or recruited host factors. The cellular functions of these host factors may also provide clues about their role during infection. For instance, LC3 has been found in conjunction with enterovirus ROs (42, 43) . In uninfected cells, lipidated LC3 is hypothesized to induce the membrane curvature underlying omegasome formation during autophagy (44) , and its recruitment to enterovirus ROs could suggest a similar role in the formation of DMVs, whose development appears to resemble that of autophagosomes.",

            "text": "While direct actors have yet to be established, it is likely that cardiovirus RO formation is dependent upon specific, membrane-associated host factors. PI4P is an essential lipid for the replication of picornaviruses (16, 18, 45) and is generated at the ER or the Golgi apparatus by PI4KA and PI4KB, respectively. Interestingly, PI4Ks are also important for HCV replication, where they appear to play a role in RO formation (19, 46) . Expression of a mutated HCV NS5A, whose ability to recruit PI4KA is impaired, has been shown to produce ROs with irregular morphologies (19) . A role for PI4Ks during RO biogenesis has also been demonstrated for enteroviruses, as RO formation was delayed under PI4KB inhibition during infections of the PI4KB inhibitor-resistant virus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) 3A-H57Y. Under these conditions, ROs were not detected at the peak of viral RNA synthesis, and this process occurred instead on apparently intact Golgi membranes (20) . In our study, PI4KA inhibition shifted the subcellular distribution of EMCV dsRNA but did not affect the time postinfection at which ROs were first detected or alter their observed morphology, connectivity with the ER, or competence to support viral RNA synthesis. These different observations in the two genera could arise from differences in the efficiency of the escape mechanism conferred by the specific resistance mutations or alternatively suggest that, unlike for enteroviruses, PI4P does not play a significant role in cardiovirus RO formation. In either case, both mutants were able to (ultimately) produce ROs with normal morphology under PI4K inhibition, showing that any role of high PI4P levels in RO formation can be circumvented by members of both picornavirus genera. PI4P is also required for efficient polyprotein processing in enteroviruses, although this requirement is circumvented in PI4KB inhibitor escape mutants (20, 33, 34) . Whether EMCV requires PI4P for polyprotein processing remains to be established.",

Although both single-and double-membrane ROs were found to support cardiovirus RNA synthesis, single-membrane structures predominated during the peak hours of genome replication. While this suggests that DMVs are largely superfluous for RNA synthesis, they may provide other benefits. DMVs could selectively sequester viral products to prevent their detection by cellular innate immune sensors. In the case of enteroviruses, it has been suggested that DMVs may also be utilized for the nonlytic release of viral progeny (47) . However, virions were only rarely detected within EMCV DMVs, which likely reflects random incorporation of virus particles and other cytosolic material when DMVs arise by enwrapping. Intriguingly, we found a large proportion of EMCV virions adjacent to ROs, suggesting close spatial coordination between RNA synthesis and capsid assembly. In enteroviruses, viral RNA synthesis and capsid assembly have been shown to be directly coupled, likely through interactions between the RNA replication machinery and the viral structural proteins (48, 49) .",

Given that all \u03e9RNA viruses to date have been found to produce spherules or DMVs, viruses tend to be classified as producing one or the other RO type. However, while picornaviruses do produce DMVs, RNA synthesis transpires predominantly on the early single-membrane structures. Thus, in addition to the negative-curvature spherules of alphaviruses and flaviviruses and the DMVs formed by coronaviruses and hepaciviruses, positive-curvature single-membrane structures appear to represent a third major form of RO.",
