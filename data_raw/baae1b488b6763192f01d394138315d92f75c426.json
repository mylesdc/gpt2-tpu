            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are the most frequent clinical syndrome affecting both children and adults, and early detection is fundamental to avoid infection-related risks and reduce the healthcare costs incurred by unnecessary antibiotic treatments. In this study, performance characteristics of two commercial methods, the Panther Fusion\u00ae assay (Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were compared to Allplex\u2122 respiratory panels (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) for the detection of influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus (RV) and adenovirus (AdV) targets. A total of 865 specimens collected prospectively and retrospectively were included, and discordant results were further examined using another commercial product, R-GENE\u2122 respiratory kits (bioM\u00e9 rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). There was high agreement between both methods, with 98.6% concordance and a kappa (k) value of 0.9 (95% CI: 0.89-0.92). A specific analysis of both methods for each viral agent demonstrated comparable sensitivity and specificity, both ranging from 0.83 to 1 with good predictive values for the prospective part of the study. Good agreement between both methods was also found for the \u03ba values obtained (ranging from 97.55% to 98.9%), with the lowest for hMPV (k = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.91) and RV (k = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65-0.81). Amplification efficiency, measured according to the value of the cycle threshold (C t ) obtained in each of the amplifications in both tests, was significantly better with Panther Fusion for Flu A, Flu B, hMPV and RV. Regarding discordant results, R-GENE showed higher agreement with Panther Fusion-positive specimens (negative for Allplex; n = 28/71, 34.9%) than with Allplexpositive samples (negative for Panther Fusion; n = 7/49, 14.3%). In summary, Panther Fusion proved to be a more efficient fully-automated methodology, requiring shorter handson and turnaround times than Allplex.

            "text": "The implementation of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has revolutionized the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections due to their high sensitivity and specificity, rapid virus identification, and the possibility of detecting pathogens that could not be identified by conventional diagnostic methods [11, 12] . However, many of the commercially available tests have focused on the detection of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and have been used in point-of-care facilities, limiting the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, fully automated commercial techniques that allow detection of a broad panel of respiratory viruses, can be adapted to variable sample sizes and would enable the application of diagnostic algorithms [12] to consider parameters such as patient characteristics (immunosuppression, basal respiratory diseases) and seasonality of the viruses. Among the commercial systems currently available, Allplex\u2122 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) offers simultaneous detection of 18 viral targets, including all respiratory virus of medical importance, and also provides epidemiological information, as it detects influenza A subtypes, RSV and parainfluenza virus types, as well as the identification of 3 of the 4 coronaviruses (229E, NL63 and OC43) that produce respiratory infection in humans. This assay allows the differentiated detection of enterovirus and picornavirus, a singular feature among commercial platforms that perform syndromic diagnosis of viral respiratory infection. These characteristics made it the routine method implemented in our laboratory starting in the 2016-2017 flu season. Allplex applies its own technology (multiple detection temperature, MuDT \u2122 ) that allows the simultaneous amplification of multiple targets at the same wavelength without melt curve analysis.",

Furthermore, Panther Fusion showed better amplification efficiency for Flu A and B, hMPV and RV detection, which may be explained by differences in the detection technology used or differences in targeted genes. Although the overall agreement between both methods was high, lower values were observed for RV and hMPV, two viruses with great genomic diversity [25] [26] . It is noteworthy that the discordant results detected with both methods were Table 7 . Discordant results between Allplex and Panther Fusion and results obtained with the reference method (R-GENE). associated with high C t values, suggesting a low viral genomic load in the clinical samples, close to the limit of detection of the assays. Several multiplexed respiratory assays with CE-IVD approval are currently available on the market. Among them, Allplex respiratory assays have shown good performance and reliable results [15] [16] [17] . The recently-developed Panther Fusion System is a fully automated randomaccess testing system that has shown comparable results with those obtained with the eSensor RVP (eSensor; Genmark Dx, Carlsbad, CA) and Lyra (Quidel, San Diego, CA) respiratory assays [13] . Our results show that this is also true when compared to Allplex technology, a method that can detect a broader variety of viruses in a single channel, but requires more hands-on time and consequently slower turnaround time. The Panther Fusion assays showed greater agreement with the third, reference rRT-PCR method than the Allplex panels, which indicates slightly better specificity for the targeted viruses.",
