            "text": "2013 marks a milestone year for plasmid DNA vaccine development as a first-in-class cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA vaccine enters pivotal phase 3 testing. This vaccine consists of two plasmids expressing CMV antigens glycoprotein B (gB) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) formulated with a CRL1005 poloxamer and benzalkonium chloride (BAK) delivery system designed to enhance plasmid expression. The vaccine's planned initial indication under investigation is for prevention of CMV reactivation in CMV-seropositive (CMV + ) recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 proof-of-concept study provided initial evidence of the safety of this product in CMV + HCT recipients who underwent immune ablation conditioning regimens. This study revealed a significant reduction in viral load endpoints and increased frequencies of pp65-specific interferon-\u03b3producing T cells in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. The results of this endpoint-defining trial provided the basis for defining the primary and secondary endpoints of a global phase 3 trial in HCT recipients. A case study is presented here describing the development history of this vaccine from product concept to initiation of the phase 3 trial.",

            "text": "The results of early clinical trials of DNA vaccine candidates indicated favorable safety and tolerability profiles and evidence of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [7, 8] . However, the perceived need by most investigators to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines resulted in the development of strategies to enhance DNA vaccine performance in humans. These strategies fall into four non-mutually exclusive categories, including: (1) plasmid design (e.g., codon optimization, promoter selection, inclusion of a genetic-adjuvant-encoding plasmid); (2) formulations (e.g., polymer, cationic liposomes, PLGA microspheres); (3) devices (e.g., Biojector \u00ae 2000, particle-mediated epidermal delivery, electroporation); and (4) heterologous prime-boost with a viral vector (e.g., NYVAC, MVA, adenovirus) or recombinant protein. Vical Incorporated (hereafter Vical) developed a CMV DNA vaccine candidate utilizing the first two of these strategies. Proof-of-concept testing of the vaccine in a phase 2 trial has been completed and the vaccine is expected to enter a pivotal phase 3 trial sponsored by Astellas Pharma, Incorporated (hereafter Astellas). A case study is presented here of the development pathway of this vaccine.",

CMV infection rates are high worldwide; the CMV seroprevalence rate in the U.S. is ~60% in \u22656 year olds and increases with age [11] . CMV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in certain high-risk situations including congenital infection of fetuses and infection of recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT), where treatment-related immunosuppression provides opportunities for CMV replication following viral acquisition or reactivation from latency. Antiviral drugs are licensed for use in transplant recipients either prophylactically or preemptively (upon evidence of viremia as measured by PCR or antigenemia assay). Unfortunately, the use of first line ganciclovir-based drugs or second line foscarnet and cidofovir can result in substantial hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity [9] . While antiviral drugs have reduced the incidence of CMV end organ disease (EOD) in CMV + HCT recipients from 25% prior to their licensure to approximately 5% today [9, 12] , alternative measures for controlling CMV replication after transplantation without attendant drug toxicities are needed. Vaccines represent one such strategy.",

            "text": "Numerous phase 1 and phase 2 trials have been conducted with several CMV vaccine candidates but a vaccine has yet to be licensed for any indication [10] . Vaccine candidates include live attenuated vaccines such as Towne strain and Towne/Toledo chimeric strains, subunit vaccines, most notably adjuvanted recombinant gB, and vectored vaccines including recombinant viral vectors using canarypox and alphavirus platforms, and plasmid DNA vaccines [10] . The live attenuated CMV Towne vaccine, derived in 1975, provided proof of concept in SOT recipients for reduced CMV disease severity after transplantation; however, it has not provided efficacy against infection in transplant recipients or in women exposed to CMV in daycare settings, and further development of this vaccine appears to depend upon implementing strategies to improve its immunogenicity [10] . Beginning in the 1990s, a recombinant gB vaccine produced in CHO cells was developed and tested in combination with an MF59 adjuvant in multiple clinical studies over the ensuing decades. Two recent randomized controlled phase 2 studies provided proof of concept for the importance of gB as a protective CMV antigen by demonstrating 50% efficacy in decreasing maternal CMV infection [13] and a significant reduction in the duration of viremia as well as the duration of antiviral ganciclovir treatment in CMV seronegative (CMV \u2212 ) recipients of kidneys or livers from CMV + donors [14] . Despite these results it is unclear whether gB adjuvanted by MF59 will continue further development for either indication. Other vaccine approaches such as viral vectored gB [15] and/or pp65 [16, 17] have completed phase 1 testing with evidence of safety and immunogenicity. It is conceivable that the recent recognition of the potential importance of creating vaccines that target the pentameric gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131 epithelial entry pathway may have contributed to redirected vaccine efforts by some companies, at least for prophylactic vaccines attempting to block both fibroblast (gB-mediated) and epithelial entry pathways [10] .",

In the early 2000s, product development activities began on several infectious disease targets, the first being CMV; by that time all of the key functional areas were in place to design, create, manufacture, release, and clinically test DNA vaccine product candidates. The functional area expertise included vaccine research, molecular biology, pharmaceutics, nonclinical testing, manufacturing, assay development, quality control (QC), quality assurance, clinical research and operations, regulatory affairs, and project planning and management. As described below, the initial CMV vaccine target indication was for CMV + HCT recipients. A product development timeline with all supporting activities for this vaccine is displayed in Figure 1 and described in the following sections. The vaccine has been referred to by different names throughout its development history including VCL-CB01, TransVax\u2122, and ASP0113, the current designation of this vaccine since its license to Astellas in 2011.

Due to the overall high CMV-seroprevalence rate, CMV + subjects represent a majority of subjects who undergo HCT. The original intent was to vaccinate normal healthy HCT donors with a 3 dose vaccination series to prime or boost CMV immune responses and then to vaccinate recipients at the time of transplantation to boost the donor's cells. This dosing regimen was thought to be superior to dosing only the recipient at the time of transplantation because of the potential reduction in vaccine efficacy due to the immunosuppressive medications required post-transplant. After initial testing in CMV + HCT recipients, Vical planned subsequent evaluation of the same vaccine product in CMV \u2212 SOT recipients of organs from CMV + donors (D + /R \u2212 ), who represent approximately 20% of all solid organ transplantations and those at highest risk for CMV infection and disease.",

First, there is a considerable safety advantage compared to live attenuated virus or viral vectors which may replicate to undesirable levels in an immunosuppressed setting typical of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning prior to transplantation. Second, there is the ability to stimulate the desired antiviral T-cell responses like live virus vaccines but unlike protein vaccines. Third, repeated vaccine administration would be required for a vaccine in this population, which is readily accomplished with plasmid DNA vaccines, but which may be difficult with viral vector vaccines which typically invoke antivector immune responses during repetitive injections. Fourth, DNA vaccines permit a focusing of immune responses on select antigens in addition to avoidance of immunoevasive CMV proteins coincidentally expressed by live attenuated CMV strains. A DNA vaccine therefore offers the potential for T-cell inducing qualities reminiscent of a live virus vaccine with the safety profile of a protein subunit vaccine-an ideal vaccine profile for transplant recipients.",

            "text": "Vical initiated development of a CMV DNA vaccine for transplant recipients in 2002 by first selecting putatively protective CMV antigens and constructing the corresponding plasmids. The control of CMV replication in transplant recipients was predominantly attributed to both CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses but a role for a vaccine-induced antibody response in reducing CMV viral loads could not be excluded and could be important in high risk CMV \u2212 SOT recipients who receive an organ from a CMV + donor. Based on the prevailing knowledge at that time, dominant T-and B-cell antigens recognized after natural infection were identified as vaccine candidates including a tegument phosphoprotein, pp65, a dominant T-cell antigen and an envelope glycoprotein, gB, a major target for neutralizing antibodies [20] [21] [22] . A comprehensive study was subsequently published in 2005 in which the prevalence of both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell recognition of essentially all (213) CMV proteins was characterized in 33 CMV + normal, healthy subjects; the results further supported the prevalent recognition of these antigens [23] . Finally, adoptive transfer studies of CMV-specific T cells supported the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of pp65-specific T-cells can control CMV replication in transplant recipients [24] [25] [26] [27] . The DNA vaccine concept was to elicit both humoral and T-cell mediated immune responses to key CMV antigens that could provide immune control early after allogeneic transplantation when CMV + recipients face the highest risk of CMV reactivation and EOD, namely within the first 100 days.",

Four amino acids, 435 RKRK 438 , were deleted from the otherwise full-length, 561 amino acid, pp65, thereby eliminating a putative kinase site [30] and mitigating theoretical safety concerns of expressing wild-type pp65. Once the final protein sequences were established, a codon-optimization using an algorithm developed at Vical was performed by changing the codon usage of five amino acids to more frequently used codons (U.S. patent 7,410,795). Each codon-optimized gene was synthesized and cloned into the Vical plasmid backbone VR10051, containing a human CMV IE1 promoter/enhancer and intron A and a modified rabbit beta globin polyA/terminator [28] .

Following a three-dose immunization schedule, DNA/CRL1005/BAK-formulations produced significantly higher responses than the same dose of DNA alone; NP antibody responses were 1.6-fold higher (p < 0.001), CD4 + responses to defined class II-restricted peptides were 1.7-fold higher (p < 0.01) and CD8 + T-cell responses to a class I-restricted peptide was 1.9-fold higher (p < 0.01; [36] ).

For clinical testing of ASP0113, Vical produced all bulk drug substance (DS) lots of each of the CMV plasmids according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Each plasmid was produced by bacterial fermentation using E. coli strain DH10B under kanamycin selection. A master cell bank was created for each plasmid with specifications for purity, potency, and identity. A manufacturer's working cell bank was derived from the master cell bank and used to inoculate an overnight culture which in turn was used to inoculate a fermentor (initially 100 L and later 500 L scale). Bacterial cell paste was collected following fermentation and was processed by alkaline lysis followed by filtration and precipitation procedures. Following downstream chromatography steps, the final purified bulk DS for each plasmid was adjusted to the final DNA concentration and frozen.

During early development the bulk DP was sterile filtered below the cloud point. However, significant product losses were incurred, leading to optimization of the process prior to phase 3. Sterile filtration of a premix containing BAK and CRL1005 below the cloud point was implemented, followed by introduction of sterile-filtered bulk DS to form the bulk DP.",

Messenger RNA expression from plasmid DNA is the most immediate biological activity measurable after DNA vaccine delivery. This highly-specific assay was designed to detect expression of each of the plasmid-derived transgenes in comparison to a reference standard to establish the percent relative potency (%RP) of any test sample. The %RP assay was incorporated as a DP release test for phase 2 clinical trial material (CTM) lots as well as for measuring stability of each lot and lot-to-lot consistency.

A reasonably representative time frame ensued from product concept to completion of phase 1 testing and accordingly the indication of the favorable safety profile and demonstration of immunogenicity in humans [38, 41] , a vital first stage for a vaccine program. In contrast, the phase 2 trial in HCT recipients took an extended period of time to enroll, largely due to the novelty of the approach and the inherently-complex nature of conducting a vaccine trial in subjects with such underlying conditions and treatment-associated morbidity; furthermore, as described in Section 2.2, the original premise was to vaccinate donors but due to the limited time donors were available prior to transplant, this proved impractical and this arm was discontinued while leaving the recipient-only arm open. In a strategy to mitigate some of the risks inherent in product development, most optimization and assay validation activities were delayed until late into the phase 2 trial. Ultimate agreement with the FDA, in addition to discussions with other global regulatory agencies in Europe and Asia, required thorough and frequent communications to define acceptable endpoints for licensure. Vical licensed this program to Astellas during this period, with joint participation from both groups for regulatory discussions on phase 3 trial endpoints. While some aspects of this product development history could have been shortened, small biotechnology companies such as Vical typically encounter resource constraints and risk management plays an important role in the timing of activities. Fortunately, the partnership for continued development of ASP0113 provides a tremendous opportunity for advancing this first-in-class therapeutic CMV vaccine towards product licensure.",

            "text": "Finally, a CMV prophylactic vaccine that can prevent congenital CMV infection would have a tremendous public health impact. However, the development of a vaccine for this indication will require considerable resources due to a longer clinical development pathway and potentially high numbers of subjects for clinical trials. Furthermore, the clinical endpoint required for licensure of such a vaccine has not been finalized [42] and has only recently received discussion between government, academia, and manufacturers [43] . Vical initiated development of a prophylactic congenital CMV vaccine (CyMVectin\u2122) by developing a different product formulation, a cationic lipid adjuvant called Vaxfectin \u00ae , combined with gB and pp65-expressing plasmids and recently published nonclinical immunogenicity and GLP safety studies [44] . Given the enormous scope of developing such a vaccine, further development of CyMVectin\u2122 would ideally proceed in partnership with a large pharma company. In parallel, additional research is ongoing to identify one or more additional plasmids expressing other CMV genes (Section 1.2) for potential inclusion in this vaccine. The encouraging proof of concept results of ASP0113 in the difficult HCT recipient population provides optimism for developing CMV vaccines for additional unmet needs.",
