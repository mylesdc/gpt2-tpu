In addition to integrative control of its aphid vector, it is of interest to examine diversity and evolution among different TBTV isolates. Methods: 5' and 3' RACE, combined with one step full-length RT-PCR, were used to clone the full-length genome of three new isolates of TBTV that exhibited mild pathogenicity in Chinese fields. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the TBTV isolates were analyzed by DNAMAN. MEGA 5.0 was used to construct phylogenetic trees. RDP4 was used to detect recombination events during evolution of these isolates.",

Diversity and phylogenetic analyses among these three new TBTV isolates and five other available isolates suggest that ORFs and 3'UTRs of TBTV may have evolved separately. Moreover, the RdRp-coding region was the most variable. Recombination analysis detected a total of 29 recombination events in the 8 TBTV isolates, in which 24 events are highly likely and 5 events have low-level likelihood based on their correlation with the phylogenetic trees. The three new TBTV isolates have individual recombination patterns with subtle divergences in parents and locations.",

TBTV is encapsidated by the coat protein encoded by TVDV, which is needed for transmission via aphids [1, 2] . However, mechanical inoculation of sap from diseased tobacco onto healthy plants leads to the loss of TVDV, implying the independent pathogenicity of TBTV [1] . Together, these viruses caused severe stunting and destructive bushy-top disease in tobacco in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1960s [3] and in Asia including China in the 1990s [1] . During 1993 to 2001, there were 51,300 hm 2 of tobacco bushy top-diseased fields including 8,700 hm 2 of total field failure in Yunnan Province of China [4] . In addition to TBTV and TVDV, two components including tobacco bushy top diseaseassociated RNA (TBTDaRNA) and satellite RNA of TBTV were also identified in tobacco with bushy-top disease [5, 6] , although all four components were not always present together [7] .",

Sudden appearance, extreme virulence and degeneration of the epidemic of tobacco bushy-top disease was a pattern similar to that of other destructive diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] , whose lethal pathogens underwent quick attenuation of pathogenicity. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the new TBTV isolates produced mild pathogenicity and how they were evolved. For single-stranded RNA viruses, recombination is a major evolutionary event allowing isolates to adapt to new environmental conditions and hosts [13] , and frequent recombination events have been detected for various RNA viruses such as Soybean mosaic virus and potyvirus isolates [14] [15] [16] .",

Comparison of the in vitro expression level of ORF1 (p35) and ORF1-frameshift protein (p98) for these isolates using wheat germ extracts (WGE) showed that that the translated levels of p35 and p98 for TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-MD-II (all mild isolates) was~40 % of the TBTV-Ch level, which was cloned from a sample showing typical tobacco bushy top disease (Wang and Yuan, unpublished data). This suggests that attenuated expression of replicase components (p35 and p98) may be in part responsible for the mild pathogenicity of new TBTV isolates in the field. Nucleotide sequence identities among TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-MD-II were 94.8 % to 97.3 % ( Table 1 ). The highest nucleotide sequence identity among the 8 TBTV isolates was 98.9 % between TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh, while the lowest was 89.0 % between TBTV-MD-II and TBTV-YWDu.

The remarkable divergence of TBTV-YWDu (Fig. 2a, c and d) and TBTV-MD-II (Fig. 2b) from the other TBTV isolates were also indicated by the phylogenetic trees. Two phylogenetic trees based on ORF3 and ORF4-coding sequences showed similar branches, which suggested that ORF3 of TBTV isolates underwent similar evolution as ORF4. Based on all data of molecular diversity and phylogentic tree, it is suggested that different ORFs-coding regions and the 3' UTR in TBTV underwent separate evolution, and the diversity of ORF1-coding region mainly determined the diversity of full-length genome.",

            "text": "During evolution of the single strand RNA viruses, recombination is a major evolutionary way for an isolate to adapt to new environmental conditions and hosts [13] [14] [15] [16] . In this study, recombination events were also analyzed among all 8 TBTV isolates. Total 29 potential recombination events were detected, in which three recombination events (events 27, 28 and 29) in TBTV-YWDu showed high reliability with P-value of at least three methods <1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ( Fig. 3b and Table 3 ). These three recombination events in TBTV-YWDu were located within 3' half and have same parents of TBTV-Ch/possible TBTV-MD-II, which is supported by the phylogenetic analysis. In phylogenetic trees based on ORF3, ORF4 and 3'UTR in 3' half of TBTV genome, TBTV-YWDu and TBTV-Ch (the minor parent) formed into a cluster, while TBTV-MD-II (the possible major parent) belonged the other different groups (Fig. 2b, e, and f ) . However, TBTV-YWDu formed a separate group in phylogentic trees based on ORF1 and p98-C in 5' half of genome ( Fig. 2a and c) , which implied why there is no recombination events in 5' half of TBTV-YWDu. The other 9 recombination events (events 4, 10, 15, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 26) seem to have a high degree of certainty due to recombination score > 0.6 ( Table 3) . Three recombination events (events 4, 10 and 15) with similar breakpoints (629-3207 in TBTV-MD-I, 652-3207 in TBTV-Ch and Table 3 TBTV-YWSh) were supported by phylogenetic tree (Table 3 and Fig. 4a) , in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch with their minor parent TBTV-YYXi of events 10/15 and TBTV-MD-I formed into a branch with its minor parent TBTV-JC of event 4. Recombination event 22 was also supported by phylogenetic tree (Table 3 and Fig. 4b) , in which TBTV-YLLi was formed into a branch with its minor parent TBTV-JC. Meanwhile, TBTV-JC was also the minor parent in recombination event 2 in TBTV-MD-I (recombination score is 0.469), which was also supported by phylogentic tree based on the fragment of 200-1550 (Fig. 4b) . Three recombination events (events 24, 25 and 26) in TBTV-YLLi also showed some correlation with phylogenetic tree based on the fragment of 1500-2480 (Table 3 and Fig. 4h) , in which TBTV-YLLi formed into a branch with its minor parent of event 24 and has near relationship with the minor parent TBTV-YYXi (event 25) or TBTV-JC (event 26). For two recombination events (events 19 and 20) in TBTV-YYXi, there is no correlation between recombination assay and phylogenetic tree based on ORF3 or ORF4-coding region ( Fig. 2e and f ) , in which TBTV-YYXi formed into a separate group. It is suggested that events 19 and 20 are possible with uncertain minor parents (Table 3) . 2b) , in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YYXi along with TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch. In addition, clue of the event 17 in TBTV-YYXi can be found in the phylogenetic tree based on p98-C-coding sequences (Fig. 2d) . Only three events (events 5, 6 and 18) were not supported by the corresponding phylogenetic trees ( Fig. 4g and e) . It is suggested that events 5, 6 and 18 are possible with uncertain minor parents ( Table 3) . All above data implied the inherent relationship between phylogenetic analysis and recombination assay. Based on the analysis on P-value, recombination score and the correlation with phylogenetic trees, 24 events within 29 possible recombination events are certainly true, while the other 5 events (events 5, 6, 18, 19 and 20) only have low-level likelihood.",

However, TBTV-MD-I have distinctive characteristic from TBTV-JC in recombination assay (Fig. 3b) . TBTV-MD-II may have different ancestor since it always formed a different branch from the branch including TBTV-JC and TBTV-MD-I in all phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2) . Although they seemed to undergo different evolution, they showed mild pathogenecity, which may due to following reasons. First, activity of RdRp was altered since RdRp-coding region is the most variable for TBTV. Second, the expression level of replicase components was lower than that of severe pathotype, which is partly confirmed by primary data of in vitro translation of p35 and p98 (Wang and Yuan, unpublished data). In addition, mutagenesis of TVDV may also partially cause the mild symptom of tobacco bushy top diseases, since TVDV could not support TBTV in some samples of tobacco bushy top disease such as sample from Baoshan city (Additional file 1: Table S1 ) and the other related data [7] . Further attention and effort are necessary to figure out the detailed mechanism on the lower expression of replicase components encoded by TBTV and the absence of interaction between TBTV and TVDV in nature.",

The first nucleotide of them is a guanylate instead of an adenylte reported in the other TBTV isolates. Identities and phylogenetic analyses indicated that variants ORFs and the 3' UTR in TBTV were evolved separately. RdRp-coding region was the most variable among TBTV isolates and the divergence of ORF1 is mainly correlated with the divergence of the fulllength genome. Frequent recombinations were detected among TBTV isolates. For three new TBTV isolates, they have different recombination pattern and may have different ancestors. RT-PCR detection of TBTV, TVDV and TBTD-assocaited RNA Total RNA was extracted from tobacco leaves using Trizol reagent (TransGen), and reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and oligonucleotides corresponding to TBTV, TVDV or TBTD-associated RNA (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase and pairs of oligonucleotides (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). For the detection of TBTV, two pairs of oligonucleotides, TB-2263-F/TB-3263-R and TB-667-F/TB-1630-R, were designed for RT-PCR assay. Accordingly, two pairs of oligonucleotides (TV-2728-F/TV-3458-R and TV-3454-F/TV-4166-R) for TVDV and one pair of oligonucleotides (TBTD-1507-F/TBTD-2016-R) for TBTD-associated RNA were designed for RT-PCR detection respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). The PCR products were cloned into pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and sequenced by using M13 primers.",
