Macrophage-like synoviocytes and FLS expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their interaction has aroused great interest. The present article studied the expression of CD147, also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer, on monocytes/macrophages and FLS from RA patients and its potential role in enhancing MMPs and the invasiveness of synoviocytes. Expression of CD147 on FLS derived from RA patients and from osteoarthritis patients, and expression of CD147 on monocytes/macrophages from rheumatic synovial fluid and healthy peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA in FLS were detected by RT-PCR. The role of CD147 in MMP production and the cells' invasiveness in vitro were studied by the co-culture of FLS with the human THP-1 cell line or monocytes/macrophages, by gel zymography and by invasion assay. The results showed that the expression of CD147 was higher on RA FLS than on osteoarthritis FLS and was higher on monocytes/macrophages from rheumatic synovial fluid than on monocytes/macrophages from healthy peripheral blood. RT-PCR showed that the expressions of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA was higher in RA FLS than in osteoarthritis FLS. A significantly elevated secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were observed in RA FLS cocultured with differentiated THP-1 cells or RA synovial monocytes/macrophages, compared with those co-cultured with undifferentiated THP-1 cells or healthy control peripheral blood monocytes. Invasion assays showed an increased number of invading cells in the co-cultured RA FLS with differentiated THP-1 cells or RA synovial monocytes/macrophages. CD147 antagonistic peptide inhibited the MMP production and the invasive potential. Our studies demonstrated that the CD147 overexpression on monocytes/macrophages and FLS in RA patients may be responsible for the enhanced MMP secretion and activation and for the invasiveness of synoviocytes. These findings suggest that CD147 may be one of the important factors in progressive joint destruction of RA and that CD147 may be a potential therapeutic target in RA treatment.",

Hyperplastic synovial lining cells overproduce such matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP, which may be involved in tissue remodeling during angiogenesis and cartilage destruction. Articular cartilage at the margins of the articular surface, to which synovium tissue can directly attach, is progressively degraded even in the disease's early stage. sion of MMPs and their interaction have been reported to be related to cartilage destruction. Although IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha are reported by some studies as key regulators of matrix degradation in RA, other molecules, such as CD147, are also thought to have played some regulatory role in RA pathogenesis [1] [2] [3] [4] . But very few reports have been presented on CD147 functions in cartilage destruction.",

Briefly, tissues were harvested by orthopedic surgeons and collected in sterile PBS. The tissues, with connective tissues and fat removed, were digested with collagenase II (4 mg/ml; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in serum-free DMEM for at least one hour at 37\u00b0C. The cell suspension was passed through a nylon mesh and the cells were then collected by centrifugation at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes and were re-suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The harvested cells were cultured in 75 cm 2 culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% Lglutamine (Gibco) and with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . When the cells had grown to confluence they were detached with 0.25% trypsin, split in a 1:3 ratio and were re-cultured in DMEM under the same conditions. To eliminate the non-adherent cells, the plated cells were washed thoroughly with PBS. Isolated synoviocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells used for our experiments were at the third to fifth passage, because these cells were more purified than the first and second passages of FLS and had better biological functions than the cells above the fifth passage. The FLS were identified by flow cytometric analysis as a homogeneous population Values presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error (n = 4-10 independent samples per group). Expressions of CD147 on FLS from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and monocytes/macrophages (including undifferentiated THP-1/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]induced differentiated dTHP-1 cells, monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients or from peripheral blood of healthy humans) were measured by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD147 mAb. Analysis was conducted on a FACS\u2122 brand flow cytometer. Two parameters of FLS and THP-1 cells were used: the percentage of positive staining cells, and the mean fluorescence intensity (denoting the quantity of CD147 expression on the surface of each cell). *P < 0.05 versus OA FLS; # P < 0.05 versus undifferentiated THP-1 cells; \u2021 P < 0.05 versus monocytes from peripheral blood of healthy humans.",

The buffer was suitable for proteinase activity, enabling the renatured proteinases to hydrolyze the copolymerized protein substrate in a zone around their position of electrophoresis. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue (R-250) and destained with buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 70% distilled water for 30 minutes to visualize these zones of digestion as light areas against the darkly stained protein background.

PMA might be a main upregulative factor that enhances expression of CD147 on the differentiated THP-1 cells. Some cytokines in the synovial fluid of RA patients, such as interferon gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, may also enhance the expression of CD147 on the monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients. The overexpression of CD147 on differentiated monocytes/macrophages suggests that CD147 may be important in the early phases of direct cell migration and of both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of MMP expression.

These results suggest that the overexpression of CD147 on macrophages may accelerate the production of MMPs and the invasive ability of RA FLS by cell-cell interaction. The overexpression of CD147 on FLS and the monocyte/ macrophage lineage, especially on MLS, suggests that CD147 may be important in both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of MMPs. From the findings that homophilic CD147 binding has occurred in the context of both heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell interactions and that CD147 can be a receptor in itself to induce MMP production, not only in primary fibroblast cells but also in tumor cells themselves [34] , we presume that the increased expression of CD147 on FLS and the monocyte/macrophage lineage, especially on MLS, in RA synovium could possibly induce MMP production through interaction.",

The environments of cocultured RA FLS and monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients or from peripheral blood of healthy humans are more like the real environment in vivo than that of co-cultured RA FLS and THP-1 cells. The results from this co-culture were consistent with those of RA FLS co-cultured with THP-1 cells, indicating that the overexpression of CD147 induces elevated levels of MMPs and their activated forms in RA FLS -and the elevated levels of MMPs in turn enhance the invasive ability of RA FLS.",

We have found that the addition of CD147 antagonistic peptide has some inhibitory effect not only on the MMP production, but also on the invasive potential of the co-cultured FLS. The inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 production by CD147 antagonistic peptide indicates that CD147 may induce MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. The mechanism by which CD147 regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 production is largely unclear, although a recent study has suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway may be involved during MMP induction in dermal fibroblasts [35] . Our previous studies have indicated that overexpression of HAb18G/CD147 enhances metastatic potentials in human hepatoma cells by disrupting the regulation of store-operated Ca 2+ entry by nitric oxide/cGMP. CD147 is required to mediate the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on the secretion and activation of MMPs and metastasis-related processes in human hepatoma cells by disrupting the regulation of nitric oxide/ cGMP-sensitive intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization [19, 20] . These findings also indicate that CD147 is involved in promoting the secretion and activation of MMPs, which in turn increases the invasive potential of FLS. These results also suggest that CD147 expression may be correlated to MMP (MMP-2, MMP-9) secretion, activation and invasive potential in RA FLS.",
