            "text": "Discriminating sterile inflammation from infection, especially in cases of aseptic loosening versus an actual prosthetic joint infection, is challenging and has significant treatment implications. Our goal was to evaluate a novel human monoclonal antibody (mAb) probe directed against the Gram-positive bacterial surface molecule lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Specificity and affinity were assessed in vitro. We then radiolabeled the anti-LTA mAb and evaluated its effectiveness as a diagnostic imaging tool for detecting infection via immunoPET imaging in an in vivo mouse model of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). In vitro and ex vivo binding of the anti-LTA mAb to pathogenic bacteria was measured with Octet, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The in vivo PJI mouse model was assessed using traditional imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) with [ 18 F]FDG and [ 18 F]NaF as well as X-ray computed tomography (CT), before being evaluated with the zirconium-89-labeled antibody specific for LTA ([ 89 Zr]SAC55). The anti-LTA mAb exhibited specific binding in vitro to LTA-expressing bacteria. Results from imaging showed that our model could reliably simulate infection at the surgical site by bioluminescent imaging, conventional PET tracer imaging, and bone morphological changes by CT. One day following injection of both the radiolabeled anti-LTA and isotype control antibodies, the anti-LTA antibody demonstrated significantly greater (P < 0.05) uptake at S. aureus-infected prosthesis sites over either the same antibody at sterile prosthesis sites or of control non-specific antibody at infected prosthesis sites. Taken together, the radiolabeled anti-LTA mAb, [ 89 Zr] SAC55, may serve as a valuable diagnostic molecular imaging probe to help distinguish between sterile inflammation and infection in the setting of PJI. Future studies are needed to determine whether these findings will translate to human PJI.",

Successful treatment occurs in (65-90)% of cases, but failure often requires further treatments, surgeries, or even amputation. 3, 4 As the total number of total hip and total knee arthroplasties in the United States is projected to exceed 4 million by the year 2030, these complications will only become more common. 2 Differentiating PJI from sterile inflammation in the postoperative period remains a challenge for contemporary diagnostic techniques, such as commonly used imaging modalities, laboratory tests, and bacterial cultures. 5 Noninvasive imaging modalities are attractive options, as they offer the potential for diagnosing, monitoring, and assessing treatment longitudinally if sufficient sensitivity and resolution can be achieved. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal gross morphological changes but unfortunately produce implant-related artifacts (especially involving metallic implants) that obscure relevant changes in the surrounding tissue.",

The antibody is directed against lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a surface-associated component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Expressed by the bacteria at high levels, this antigen is a promising target for directed imaging and therapeutic agents.

To control for variability in the size of the femurs between the individual mice, data are presented as averages of the fold increase of the measurement of the postoperative femur over the contralateral, non-operative femur. The femur volumes of S. aureus-infected postoperative legs had a doubling of bone volume for the entire femur (2.1 \u00b1 0.06, n = 8) compared with sterile, postoperative legs, which had a slight increase over their non-operative counterpart (1.2 \u00b1 0.03, n = 4, P < 0.000 1), the large size and structural differences of which can be seen in representative scans ( Fig. 4a-e) . Taken together, CT data analysis showed that the S. aureus-infected operative legs had a marked expansion of the femur volume compared with sterile postoperative legs, which is consistent with our previous observations. 16, 23 Specificity of the anti-LTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) In order to specifically measure the infectious entity itself, we developed an immunoPET agent against LTA, a cell-surface component of Gram-positive bacteria. An anti-LTA mAb (SAC55) was identified from memory B cells isolated from a patient recovering from an S. aureus skin infection. This human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) was evaluated for binding specificity and selectivity for LTA-positive strains of pathogenic bacteria with clinical significance. Affinity measurements by Octet of SAC55 binding to immobilized LTA showed strong binding for the target (Fig. 5a) . SAC55 was also found by whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to bind specifically to LTA-positive bacteria, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but not to Gramnegative bacteria (specifically Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), whereas the control IgG did not bind to any of the LTA-negative bacterial species tested ( Fig. 5b) SAC55 also bound to in vitro grown S. aureus and S. epidermidis as measured by flow cytometry in the presence of human sera (Fig. 5c ), thus indicating that the binding epitope for this anti-LTA mAb is not obscured by the presence of human sera. Similarly, this anti-LTA mAb retained binding to the bacteria ex vivo, indicating that LTA is expressed, and its epitope is accessible for antibody binding on bacteria harvested from infected mice (Fig. 5d) . These results indicate that SAC55 is a valid candidate to specifically detect LTA-expressing bacteria in an infected animal.",

[ 18 F]FDG has previously been explored as a non-specific probe for evaluating PJI with varying success. 18 PET provides insight into the metabolism of host tissue, as cells that utilize radioglucose trap the tracer locally. PET provides millimeter-scale tomographic images of tracer distribution throughout the whole body, while CT provides higher-resolution attenuation maps of use for anatomical localization, abnormal tissue findings, and to identify sites of bone degeneration. We have shown that FDG uptake in the surgical distal femur of infected mice was much greater than that of the contralateral, nonsurgical femur and also correlated with the BLI findings in the surgical vs nonsurgical sites. However, we also found increased FDG uptake in the sterile surgical leg (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that some uptake is due to inflammation caused by the surgery. While [ 18 F]FDG may easily identify robust PJI, indolent infections with low bacterial burdens, or those being actively treated, may be indistinguishable from sterile background inflammation. 25 [ 18 F]NaF has previously been used to assess the impacts of tuberculosis and total hip arthroplasty, as it is taken up by the surrounding bone matrix at these degenerative sites. [19] [20] [21] While gross morphological changes were seen in this study after months of infection in the mouse model, such changes may not be distinguishable in the absence of long-term infection. Remodeling of the bone due to sterile inflammation may again preclude the distinction of indolent infection vs sterile inflammation, as confirmed when comparing the sterile implant to the contralateral knee (Fig. 3b) . While CT and [ 18 F]NaF PET may not aid in early diagnosis of PJI, they may be useful once substantial remodeling has occurred.
