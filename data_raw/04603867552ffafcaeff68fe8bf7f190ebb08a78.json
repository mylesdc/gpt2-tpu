During the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, for example, the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions, and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization. Here, we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods. In particular, we show that without greater care in model formulation, we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations.",

Subsequent refinements of the model have incorporated an additional exposed (infected but not yet infectious) class (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered [SEIR] models) (see Protocol S1 for mathematical equations). One of the fundamental mathematical assumptions in such models is that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is constant, irrespective of the period already spent in that class. While mathematically very convenient, this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [18] [19] [20] . A more sensible formulation would be to specify the probability of leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class, such that initially the chance of leaving the class is small, but the probability increases as the mean infectious/latent period is reached. This would give rise to a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious periods, with a stronger central tendency. A convenient way to describe such distributions is to write an expression for the infectious class (neglecting the latent class for this example) as follows: ",

The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function, P(t), and as such the average infectious period, denoted by 1/c, is given by R ' 0 P\u00f0t\u00dedt [21] . The probability density function of the infectious period, p(t), is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function, \u00c0dP(t)/dt. Different functional forms for p(t) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model. For example, setting p(t) equal to e \u00c0ct /c recovers the classical exponentially distributed SIR model. More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing p(t) to be a gamma probability density function [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , with parameters c and n (see Protocol S1). An alternative (and computationally efficient) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nc being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses. The advantage of this formalism is that when n \u00bc 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model, which has a large variance, while as n!' we obtain a fixed infectious period. The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A ; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data.",

            "text": "The dynamical consequences of these differences in the distribution of infectious and latent periods have received some attention over the past two decades. It has been shown, for example, that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [21, 24] , though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [22, 26] . When contact rates vary seasonally, for example, to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [28, 29] , changes in p(t) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [25, 26, 30 ]. An issue that has received surprisingly little attention, despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible ''deliberate exposure,'' is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population. This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within-host dynamics of viral disease, such as HIV, for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [31, 32] . In particular, Lloyd [33] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions. Here we are interested in the application of this work to between-host transmission dynamics. As can be seen in Figure 1B , changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve: in comparison to a gamma-distributed model, the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model (i) takes off at a dramatically slower rate, (ii) predicts a significantly smaller (approximately 56%) peak number of cases, and (iii) lasts much longer (almost twice as long).",

Alternatively, one may use the well-established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic, the growth rate is approximately exponential [17, 20] , with the rate determined by R 0 . First, we use this approach to examine, in general, how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data.

The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1/r and 1/c, respectively, and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data. This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33] . The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A . It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0 . In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing n), lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k. On the other hand, as the variance in the latent period is reduced (increasing m), higher values of R 0 are estimated. Indeed, we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle: if we ignore the latent period, then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. When the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B ). In closely examining equation 4, we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class (1/r \u00bc 0) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included (1/ r . 0) (see equation S1 in Protocol S1). Therefore, when faced with a rapidly spreading infection, either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures (such as mass vaccination) that will be needed to control the epidemic. The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk. The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed (lower surface) or fixed (higher surface). We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k. (B) At higher values of k, R 0 may be substantially over-or underestimated using the classical exponentially distributed model (n \u00bc m \u00bc 1) compared to periods of fixed lengths (n \u00bc m!'), depending on whether an exposed class is included (solid lines) or not (dashed lines).

For illustration, we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [37] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching. In the absence of independent data, this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters. Of course, here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges, since the influenza virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [38] . We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n. For comparison, we also determine the best-fit parameters in the absence of any latent period. The least squares errors and estimated R 0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3 . These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section: (i) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R 0 , and (ii) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R 0 than their gammadistributed counterparts.",

However, the best-fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model (m \u00bc 2, n \u00bc 2) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ): the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six (up to the peak in incidence) or more points are used. This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take-off (k \u00bc 1.0837 d \u00c01 ), and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4. For the SIR model (n \u00bc 1, 1/c \u00bc 2.2 d) we obtain an R 0 of 4.38 whereas for the SEIR model (m \u00bc 2, n \u00bc 2, 1/r \u00bc 2.6 d, 1/c \u00bc 2.1 d) we obtain an R 0 of 16.9. Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. Given that we are fitting an additional parameter, it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions. However, this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .",

Depending on the precise details, inappropriate model selection may give rise to either gross over-or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection. However, even when parameter estimates are reliable, choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations concerning individual-level control strategies. Historically, it has been shown that contact tracing and the effective quarantine of infected individuals and those potentially exposed is an important means of infection management [13, 39, 40] . We introduce both these measures into the SEIR epidemic model, assuming that there is a small delay in detecting newly infectious individuals, which may represent an asymptomatic phase or uncertainty in diagnosing symptoms (see Methods and Protocol S1). As we show in Figure 4 , the precise levels of isolation of infected individuals and of quarantining contacts required to control the outbreak and the predicted level of disease incidence are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed SEIR model or a more realistic framework is used.",

It is much more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed because it essentially truncates the tail of the distribution, so that the infectious period of a few individuals is dramatically reduced. This effect is not as pronounced in the gamma-distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods (see Figure 1A ). In the same way, a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model because during this time many individuals will have naturally left the infectious class. Under the assumption of a gamma-distributed infectious period most individuals are infectious for a minimum period of time so early detection is (C) We plot the incidence data along with the SEIR best fit (m \u00bc 2, n \u00bc 2) and that obtained by ignoring any latent period (n \u00bc 1)-the SIR best fit. (D) The best-fit estimate of R 0 changes for these two models as we increase the number of points used in the fitting procedure. When fitting the models, for each value of n (and m), we are estimating the average infectious period, 1/c, and transmission parameter, b (and average latent period, 1/r). The effective population size for the influenza outbreak was known to be N \u00bc 763. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020174.g003 more important. While the predicted difference between the exponential and gamma-distributed models depends on the duration of the infectious period and the fraction of contacts traced, it is generally true that models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will give rise to overly optimistic predictions concerning the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals.",

We have also formulated a model that takes into account the distribution of the latent period during quarantine and find similar qualitative results to those shown in Figure 4 . However, if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period and there is only a small amount of isolation of infected individuals, then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma-distributed model, because more exposed individuals in the exponentially distributed model will leave quarantine before they develop the infection.",

Although the data required for such a task are often available from post hoc analyses of epidemics they are certainly lacking for a novel emerging infection. Instead, the uncertainty surrounding assumptions about the distributions should be incorporated into quantitative predictions made from epidemiological models, especially since this may well be greater than any uncertainty that arises from noise in the data. Of course, more sophisticated fitting methods than those used in this paper exist [43] [44] [45] [46] , but if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate, the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant.",

For the same basic reproductive ratio, R 0 \u00bc 5, and the same average infectious period, c \u00bc 1, larger values of n lead to a steeper increase in prevalence and an epidemic of shorter duration.

            "text": "Background When a new infectious disease emerges, such as SARS, it is important to try to predict how the disease will behave, e.g., how infectious it is and what its latent period is, so that the spread of the disease through the population can be estimated and appropriate public health measures such as quarantining can be decided on.What Did the Authors Do? They assessed different currently used mathematical models of disease outbreaks, including models that took no account of latent periods, and another that assumed that the latent and infectious periods had a particular pattern-called exponential. They showed that both of these assumptions could potentially lead to underestimating the way the disease spreads. They then tested their predictions on a known outbreak of influenza that occurred in a school.What Do These Findings Mean? Public health officials may need to rethink the way that they try to predict outbreaks of infectious disease. Minimally, they need to be sure that they put into any model the most accurate predictions of the behavior of the disease.Where Can I Get More Information? The Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom has a Web site that explains its work on assessing infectious disease outbreaks: http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/default.htm The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States is a good place to start for information on any new infectious diseases: http://www.cdc.gov/",
