In the current study, the long-term viral safety of macrobead implantation into pancreatectomized diabetic dogs treated with pravastatin ( = 3) was assessed while 2 dogs served as nonimplanted controls. A more gradual return to preimplant insulin requirements occurred after a 2nd implant procedure (days 148, 189, and >652) when compared to a first macrobead implantation (days 9, 21, and 21) in all macrobead implanted animals. In all three implanted dogs, porcine C-peptide was detected in the blood for at least 10 days following the first implant and for at least 26 days following the second implant. C-peptide was also present in the peritoneal fluid of all three implanted dogs at 6 months after 2nd implant and in 2 of 3 dogs at necropsy. Prescreening results of islet macrobeads and culture media prior to transplantation were negative for 13 viruses. No evidence of PERV or other viral transmission was found throughout the study. This study demonstrates that the long-term (2.4 years) implantation of agaroseagarose encapsulated porcine islets is a safe procedure in a large animal model of type I diabetes mellitus.",

As noted above, a necessary component of the transplantation of an allogeneic pancreas or the islets alone is the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Because complications from such immunosuppressive therapy can include increased susceptibility to infections, malignancy, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity, allotransplantation must be carefully considered and is often not suitable for young patients [3] .

The use of pigs as an islet source provides an unlimited number of organs for islet isolation and encapsulation. Further, porcine insulin is nearly identical to human insulin, differing in only a single amino acid and it has been used in the clinic since its discovery in 1922 [7] . The double layered agarose encapsulation of the porcine islets also provides at least some protection from recipient immune responses to the xenogeneic islets and is likely to ameliorate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. In fact, we have previously shown the porcine islet macrobeads to enable the discontinuation of exogenous insulin for more than 6 months (study termination) in spontaneously diabetic BB rats without immunosuppressive therapy [6] .",

Insulin production during a 24 hr period of in vitro culture was determined once a week prior to macrobead implantation for each batch of islet macrobeads (see below) so that an average quantity of insulin secretion per macrobead in the four weeks prior to each implant could be calculated (see Table 3 ). The daily exogenous insulin requirements of each macrobead implanted dog were multiplied by 4 (first implant) or 3 (second implant) and enough macrobeads implanted to provide either a 4\u00d7 or 3\u00d7 dose of insulin. As insulin production varies with every batch of islet macrobeads, each preparation of islet macrobeads was evenly divided amongst the different recipient dogs such that each animal received a proportion of each batch of macrobeads based on exogenous insulin requirements.

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrate the safety of transplanting agarose-agarose porcine islet macrobeads in a fully discordant large animal model as a treatment for insulin dependent diabetes. Importantly, specific immunosuppressive therapy was not administered, although pravastatin was given for its mild anti-inflammatory properties. All three dogs that received porcine islet macrobeads were insulinfree for approximately 2 weeks following the first implant procedure. Preimplant insulin requirements were reached over the following week such that by three weeks after implantation all animals were again on full insulin requirements. Remarkably, the implanted dogs did not reach preinsulin requirements following the second implant, until significantly longer periods of time. In fact, one animal still had not reached preimplant insulin requirements, at necropsy, on day 652 following 2nd implant. A significant issue with any xenotransplantation procedure is the possibility of xenozoonosis. In the case of porcine islets, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) is encoded throughout the porcine genome, and because it is unlikely to be removed, this virus has generated considerable attention of the xenotransplantation community and regulatory authorities (see review by Denner and Tonjes [16] ). Although PERV was shown to infect human cells in vitro [17] , there is no evidence of transmission to humans including farmers, veterinarians, or abattoir workers, all of whom are exposed daily to numerous porcine secretions, excretions, blood, and tissues. More than 80 years of using porcine insulin in the clinic has also not revealed any transmission of PERV. Preclinical studies in nonhuman primates have also not detected any evidence of PERV transmission [18] even with high dose immunosuppression and high titers of PERV [19] . Also assuring are the negative human clinical findings of PERV transmission to date including burn patients treated with porcine skin [20] , patients with hemophilia treated with porcine factor VIII [21] , and patients receiving extracorporeal porcine hepatocyte therapy [22] [23] [24] , as well as from two clinical trials of porcine islets following implantation [25, 26] . Nonetheless, the accidental transmission of animal viruses and PERV in particular mandate a carefully thought out strategy to manage such risks [27, 28] .",

We have recently demonstrated the proliferation of macrobead encapsulated porcine insulin-producing cells over the first few weeks of culture [29] . During this time, insulin production increases from starting levels and gradually stabilizes. This allows a determination of the precise insulinproducing capacity of encapsulated islets and the subsequent implantation of a patient-tailored dose of macrobeads to meet individual insulin demands.",

Traditional organ allografting techniques do not allow for the extended testing times required to assure the absence of xenorelated infectious diseases, and until now, the promise of islet xenotransplantation has been largely unrealized by this restraint. The agarose-agarose islet macrobead affords ample time for extensive microbiological safety testing. We consider this an advanced technique to the antemortem screening of donor animals because the tissue to be transplanted can be tested directly. This is a significant technological advance and one with the potential to finally make xenotransplantation a reality. Furthermore, additional patient safety is obtained by not requiring the immunosuppression of macrobead recipients [30] .",

All tissues were found to be negative for the screened viral sequences although some low level amplification was observed for PCV in some tissues of all dogs including the nonimplanted control animals. As low level amplification signals for the PCV target were detected in both negative control and macrobead implanted animals, it is likely that this finding is due to a cross-reaction with canine specific sequences. The negative findings from the extensive viral screening of the islet macrobeads prior to implantation also support the notion that porcine islet macrobead implantation, under the conditions of this study, can be performed safely and does not result in trans-species viral transmission.",

These results demonstrate the ability of the islet macrobeads to resist breakage in vivo. Perhaps the most impressive finding at necropsy was the mild degree of inflammatory reaction in the peritoneal cavity which was not thought to impair organ function. Furthermore, these data also demonstrate the capacity of the abdomen to accommodate a large number of macrobeads. Ongoing improvements in the insulin secretion capacity of each islet macrobead continue to allow for the implantation of fewer macrobeads in order to replace exogenous insulin. Finally, current clinical trials of a similarly sized mouse renal adenocarcinomacontaining agarose macrobead for the inhibition of various cancers have shown the human abdomen to easily house several thousand such macrobeads [32, 33] .",

Exogenous insulin totals are graphed as a sum of daily AM and PM insulin units received (closed squares). Control animals (did not receive porcine islet macrobeads) are shown in (a) ILX-1 and IWX-1. Animals that received porcine islet macrobeads are shown in (b) FOX-1, HSX-1, and KOX-1.3.7.Histopathology. Tissues and macrobeads collected at necropsy were processed and examined by a board-certified pathologist. Viable islet cells were not found in the macrobeads examined from the three implanted dogs. The majority of the macrobeads were found to contain amorphous basophilic, mineralized granules. Some macrobeads were surrounded by a proliferative inflammatory capsule characterized by a minimal to mild degree of Serum porcine C-peptide levels of macrobead implanted dogs following 1st and 2nd implant [(a): FOX-1 (triangle); HSX-1 (square); KOX-1 (circle)]. Porcine C-peptide was also detected in the peritoneal fluid of implanted study animals following glucose/arginine challenge.(b) Porcine-C-peptide was not determined (n.d.) at all timepoints for HSX-1 because fluid was not collected beyond 30-35 minutes. Macroscopic images taken at necropsy for a nonimplant control animal [ILX-1; (a), (c)] and a porcine islet macrobead recipient [HSX-1; (b), (d)]. (a)-(b) were taken at the initial opening. (c)-(d) are images of the mesentery of both animals.tissue. Peritoneal organs and tissues with a serosal surface had minimal to mild proliferative and inflammatory lesions. The lesions were composed of fibrous connective tissue covered with a thin layer of mesothelium or mesothelial cells. There were no systemic effects attributable to the presence of the macrobeads.",
