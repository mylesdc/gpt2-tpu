Dates of the stays as well as name and place of the institution were assessed. This information was used to calculate the number of inpatient stays and the sum of days patients spent in stationary care.

Health insurance is mandatory, and the access to and the reimbursement of services are comprehensive [19] . With regard to patients after ARDS, their situation is characterized by the following specific circumstances in Germany: Albeit the rehabilitation system is elaborated [22] , there are no follow-up clinics or rehabilitation units that are specialized in the care of former ARDS patients. Thus, the choice of a clinic or a rehabilitation unit is informed by the underlying disease which has caused ARDS or it follows practical considerations such as whether an institution is able to deal with a patient's health status and need of care as well as the currently available capacities.

During the Table 3 Univariable negative binomial regression analyses of days of hospitalization after discharge from ICU IRR incidence rate ratio, SE standard error, 95% CI 95% confidence interval, SAPS-II Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II, SOFA sequential organ failure assessment, GCS Glasgow Coma Scale a Derived from educational and professional levels [36] first 6 months after discharge from ICU, former sepsis patients from the control group (care as usual) spent a median time of 8 days (IQR 0-32) in a hospital and of 0 days (IQR 0-21) in a rehabilitation clinic. During the months seven to 12 after discharge, the median number of days of both hospital and rehabilitation stay was 0 [24] . However, the number of outpatient visits was comparable to our study. The representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) found that 16% of the general population was hospitalized at least once during a 1-year period for on average 9.7 nights. Not unexpectedly, this is in stark contrast to the findings from our sample: 90% of participants had one or more additional hospital stays (including rehabilitation) within the first year after discharge from ICU. With respect to healthcare use in the outpatient sector, the DEGS1 survey found that the mean number of outpatient visits (including visits to general practitioners) per year was 9.2 in the general population. However, persons over the age of 70 years and people with poor self-rated health had a mean number of 11.5 and 15.0 visits, respectively [25] . The latter corresponds to the finding obtained from our cohort and reflects a substantial morbidity among survivors of ARDS.",

However, the percentages of 32% and 14% in our study are quite high as compared to 8% and 4% of people from the general population in Germany who had contact to a psychiatrist/neurologist or psychotherapist within a 1-year period, respectively [25] . As help seeking for mental disorders can be difficult for some people, these high percentages of patients after ARDS who utilized mental health care are likely to reflect a special need of this population. A systematic review found that mental disorders are common in people after ARDS: The prevalences for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) approximately range between 20 and 40% [4] . A more recent study reported that even two-thirds of patients after ARDS are experiencing symptoms of mental disease [30] .",
