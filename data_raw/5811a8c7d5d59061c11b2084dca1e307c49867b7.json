The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different fiveyear plan periods. (3) The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector. (4) The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector. , et al.

Therefore, comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city-level carbon emissions accounting, as well as local emission mitigation strategies [28] . The second strand of research focuses on the city-level driving factors and influencing mechanisms. Decomposition analysis (e. g. Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) and Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA)) and regression method (e. g. Stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model) are the most commonly applied methods for the scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis of factors influencing city-level carbon emissions, especially the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method based on the IDA framework. As shown in Table 1 , the SDA method based on the IO technique applied in the city-level driving factors and influencing mechanisms research in China were mainly focused on the four municipalities (i. e. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing), because of the available IO data base compiled by the Municipality Bureau of ",

            "text": "Statistics. In other words, the IO data sources were lacking in other provincial capital cities and medium-sized cities in China. Consequently, the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [59] [60] [61] [62] , owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period-wise or timeseries manner [63] [64] [65] , where the preferred one in the LMDI [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . By means of LMDI method, Wang et al. [46] investigated the main driver for industrial carbon emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic band from 1996 to 2010, and the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors. Wang et al. [42] decomposed the influencing factors of residential carbon emissions in Beijing and found that the rising per capita GDP and the declining energy intensity contributed the most to emissions changes during 2000 to 2010. Similar results, conducted by Wang et al. [54] , can also be found in Suzhou city. Zhao et al. [49] decomposed the main drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai and found that industrial output, energy intensity, energy and industrial structure were major determinants for emissions changes. Shao et al. [50] adopted an extended LMDI method and investigated the techno-economic drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai, and the results showed that industrial output scale was mainly responsible for emission increments while industrial structure adjustment, R&D intensity, and energy intensity were most significant factors in mitigating emissions. Kang et al. [51] performed a multi-sectoral decomposition analysis of city-level greenhouse gas emissions in Tianjin from 2001 to 2009, including the agricultural, industrial, transportation, commercial and other sectors, and the results showed that economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments while energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions. Hopefully, previous studies about driving factors and influencing mechanisms of city-level carbon emissions performed on China's megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai etc., have made great contributions to the realization of regional low-carbon road map. But, the previous LMDI studies mainly focused on the economic growth effect, the energy intensity effect, the population size effect, and the technology progress effect influencing the change of carbon emissions. It fails to distinguish the effects of economic structure, population structure, and energy structure on the change of carbon emissions. In fact, the strongest factors that offset China's energy consumption and carbon emissions have shifted from efficiency gains to structural changes [74, 75] . Structural indicators combined with other traditional and emerging factors should also be deeply considered and investigated in China's regional energy and carbon researches, which may perform different influencing mechanism in different regions during different development stages. Compared with four municipalities, there were relatively few studies conducting on Guangzhou city, one of China's first-tier cities, with the considerable GDP scale and total energy consumption amount (Table 2) . Meanwhile, Guangzhou has the highest level of per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption than the four municipalities. Guangzhou is the provincial capital of Guangdong province, the most developed coastal region in the southeast of China (Fig 1) . In addition, Guangzhou city is an important manufacturing base in China as well as a pilot zone for low-carbon city announced by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2012. Therefore, Guangzhou city may serve as a demonstration of how to realize the targets of low-carbon city development, thereby highlighting the importance and representativeness of studying its features and drivers for carbon emissions in detail.",

However, there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [21] . Based on China's energy statistic and the reference approach of IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse gas Emission Inventories, there are mainly three approach to account, i. e. primary energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables) [63] , final energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, renewables, and electricity/heating) [61, 62] , and total energy consumption from the \"Energy Balance Table\" including the aggregate summary of energy production, energy transformation and final consumption [76, 77] . Compared with the primary energy consumption accounting and the final energy consumption accounting, apparent energy consumption data [78, 79] from the comprehensive energy balance table was recommended for this study. As shown in the Table 3 , the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules, namely, 1) total energy available for local consumption as a result of interprovincial and international energy trades, 2) input-output of energy conversion transformation for thermal power, heating, coking, petroleum refining, and gas production, 3) final consumption due to primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, and residential consumption. Primary industry, namely, agriculture, mainly includes farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. Secondary industry includes manufacturing industries and construction industry. Tertiary industry includes transportation, storage, post and telecommunication services, wholesale, retail trade and catering services, and other service sectors. Then, we calculated energy-related carbon emissions by energy types according to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table, as follows the equation:",

Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity need to be calculated by considering the total amount of imported electricity and the corresponding emissions factor of power generation The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model [56] . As for China's power supply system, electricity is supplied by the main six regional grids five-year plan period, respectively.), which were issued by the central government and performed by the local government. But in fact, carbon emissions mitigation in the boundary mainly benefited from contributions of the imported electricity from the neighbors Guizhou and Yunnan provinces via the cross-province electricity trades. During the same period, carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity dramatically increased 3.236 million tons in 2010 to 4.379 million tons in 2013. Rapidly increasing carbon emissions embodied in imported electricity indicated that there were large amounts of fossil energy were burned for power. Final products-thermal power was consumed in Guangzhou, while carbon emissions were discharged in its neighbor producers. If these carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity were allocated to the final consumer, Guangzhou would have paid more efforts and implemented more strict mitigation measures to achieve its energy saving and emission reduction targets.",

Guangzhou's industrial carbon emissions increased by 6.29 million tons mainly because the rapid economic development. The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, bringing in a 5.43 million tons increase, accounting for 86.34% of the total industrial carbon emissions changes, which was followed by the energy intensity effect of service (e-effect-Service), the carbon intensity effect of service (f-effect-Service), and the economic structure effect (s-effect). In order to achieve the basic standards of modernization (i. e. per capita GDP is more than 5000 U.S. dollar, and the third industry added value accounted for more than 50% of GDP etc.), Guangzhou paid more efforts to foster the three pillar industries (i. e. electronic information manufacturing industry, automobile industry, and petrochemical Table 5 ",

The adjustment of industrial structure in Guangzhou was mainly focused on upgrading the traditional advantage industries (i. e. iron and steel, shipbuilding, machinery and equipment, electricity, paper, and textile etc.) and fostering the new and high technology industries (i. e. Software, new material, new energy, and digital industry etc.), announced in the 11 th five-year plan for socioeconomic development in Guangzhou Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector in Guangzhou. Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector were decomposed yearly first (Table 6 ) and divided into 3 periods (Fig 5) . Although the residential carbon emissions in Guangzhou accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total carbon emissions, it exhibited a rapid growth trend during the whole research period along with the improvement of urbanization level. The total residential carbon emissions increased from 0.55 million tons in 2003 accounting for 3.61% of the total carbon emissions to 2.01 million tons accounting for 6.59% in 2013. Furthermore, the residential carbon emission increments were mainly generated by the urban residents, which increased from 0. The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model was always two times of the average income of rural residents during the same period. The energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth, resulting in a 0.26 million tons decrease, accounting for 34.87% of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value. During the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013), Guangzhou's residential carbon emissions increased by 0.51 million tons. The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) and the carbon intensity effect of urban (f-effect-Urban) were the most two dominant positive driving factors on the carbon emissions increment, bringing in 0.49 million tons and 0.29 million tons increase, accounting for 95.88% and 57.43% of the total residential carbon emissions changes, respectively.",

The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods. Overall, the affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing the carbon emission growth at the industrial sector.

Meanwhile, per capita GDP in Guangzhou grew from 38631.93 Yuan in 2003 to 92423.82 Yuan in 2013 (at the fixed price in 2003), which was 2.39 times as higher as in 2003 after ten years of rapid economic development.Along with the rapid economic development, total energy consumption increased rapidly from 23.529 million tons of coal equivalent (tce) in 2003 to63.198  million tce in 2013, showing an average annual growth rate of 9.39% over a period of 11 years. However, there were various growth trends existing in the main 9 types of energy sources over the research period. The leading energy in Guangzhou over the whole research period is still coal (raw coal plus coke), which increased from 14.494 million tce in 2003 to 22.993 million tce in 2011, then decreased to 20.198 million tce in 2013. Oil products such as gasoline and diesel oil also play an important role in Guangzhou's energy consumption system. Gasoline and diesel oil had an overall growing trend, which grew from 3.636 million tce in 2003 to16.099 million tce in 2013. In addition, the most important features of energy consumption structure in Guangzhou, is the electricity consumption. The electricity consumption as shown inFig 2,is not the thermal power or renewable energy power generated in Guangzhou, which represented the imported electricity from the neighbors of Guangdong province-Yunnan province, Guizhou province, and Guangxi province etc. The imported electricity was calculated from the comprehensive energy balance table in Guangzhou. The imported electricity increased rapidly from 0.173 million tce in 2003 to 13.118 million tce in 2013, which played an important role in the energy consumption system in Guangzhou. As shown inFig 2,there was a sharply increase in the imported electricity in Guangzhou after 2009. The rapid increase in the imported electricity resulted in the sluggish and even decrease in fossil energy consumption in Guangzhou to a great extent in recent years. In fact, the increased imported electricity consumed in Guangzhou was benefited by the \"West-East electricity transmission project\" [84] conducting by China's central government after 2000. The similar condition was familiar in other mega cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin etc[14].",

Guangzhou city is supplied by the South China Grid which covered Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. According to the \"West-East electricity transmission project\", the southern route of this project refers to transmitting Guizhou's thermal power and Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi's hydropower to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau [84]. At present, Guangdong's imported electricity was mainly from Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. More than 60 percent of the cross-province electricity trades were thermal power, and less than 40 percent were hydropower, based on our estimation according to the relevant government documents (e. g. The 12 th five-year plan for energy development in Guangdong province [85], and the 12 th five-year plan for power industry development in Guizhou province [86]). The corresponding emissions factor of power generation in South China Grid can be found in the baseline emission factors for China's regional grid announced by the National Development and Reform Commission. As shown in Fig 3, there were obviously two different carbon emissions evolution processes in Guangzhou, namely, the first stage (2003-2009) and the second stage (2010-2013). During the first stage, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion increased rapidly from 15.243 million tons in 2003 to 26.822 million tons in 2009 with an annual growth rate of 8.41%. Raw coal is still the biggest contributor to the total carbon emissions, which was followed by diesel oil, gasoline, and fuel oil. But the share of raw coal contributing to the total emissions has decreased dramatically from 63.69% in 2003 to 52.45% in 2009. During the same period, carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity increased from 0.057 million tons in 2003 to 1.080 million tons in 2009. And the share of imported electricity accounting for the total emissions has decreased from 0.37% in 2003 to 3.87% in 2009. Imported electricity has played an important but relatively minor effect on the total carbon emissions in Guangzhou during this period. During the second stage, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion increased slowly from 29.130 million tons in 2010 to 30.565 million tons in 2013 with an annual growth rate of 1.21%, and even decreased from 30.693 million tons in 2011 to29.811 million tons in 2012. Raw coal is still the biggest contributor to the total carbon emissions during this period. In such a case, Guangzhou perfectly completed the energy saving and emission reduction targets (i. e. the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit GDP decreased by 16% and 17% during the 12 th",
