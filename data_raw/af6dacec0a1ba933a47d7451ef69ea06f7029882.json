The etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in the lungs is difficult to determine, in part because a good quality specimen from the site of the infection is not readily available [1] [2] [3] [4] . Access to such a specimen would be an important advance in the monitoring and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as other lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, lung cancer, etc. Presently, oropharyngeal (OP), sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are typically used to monitor CF patients. OP specimens may be appropriate for detecting viruses, but are not ideal for most bacterial pathogens. Sputum is commonly collected to monitor CF but often contains contaminants and cystic fibrosis related bacteria (CFRB) from the upper respiratory tract. The difficulty some patients have in producing an acceptable sputum specimen further decreases the value of these samples, often causing the physician to treat the patient empirically [1] [2] [3] [4] . BAL provides a specimen from the lungs but is an invasive procedure that cannot be routinely used. BAL specimens may also collect contaminants from the upper respiratory tract 5-7 .",

When a patient coughs into the device, this air from the upper airways first flows into the reservoir (Figure 2a ). The exhaled air flows to the reservoir first as it has the least resistance compared to the filter at the end of the device. This reservoir has a volume of 250 ml, approximately 100 ml greater than the volume of anatomic dead space in the average adult 15 , which ensures that all of the upper airway aerosols are completely separated out. The expanded reservoir is inelastic, creating a back-pressure, so subsequent exhaled breath is forced through the microbial filter ( Figure 2b ).

Patients with high amounts of M. tuberculosis in cough aerosols were more likely to have transmitted to others 30 . Those that produce large amounts of pathogens in coughs may be more efficient transmitters, e.g. \"superspreaders\" 13,30 . The quantity of pathogens in a cough may be a critical metric in transmission of infectious disease, controlling epidemics, and monitoring colonization. In the Jones-L\u00f3pez et al. study, the amount of aerosolized M. tuberculosis fell dramatically after three weeks of treatment. Therefore, a cough specimen could also be used to monitor levels of resistant bacteria, if present.",

Comment #1: I am not familiar with the term Cycle Threshold, \" \". The term is introduced in the first C paragraph of the Methods and then mentioned again in the last paragraph of the Methods. It would have been helpful to me to have had a brief discussion of this term in the Introduction or Methods. The C values were discussed in full paragraphs in the Results and Discussion sections so it is clearly an important metric for this study and there could be other readers not familiar with . C Comment #2: Evaluation of microbiologic results in bronchiectasis patients is difficult. First, there is no \"gold standard\" test for identifying potential respiratory pathogens in the lungs of these patients. Microbiome studies suggest that a large number of potential respiratory pathogens populate the lungs of these patients but do not help determine which one(s) are responsible for symptoms or clinical deterioration and therefore might benefit from therapy. Similarly, microbiology results from BAL do not necessarily identify pathogens responsible for symptoms and clinical deterioration. I think these observations are pertinent with regard to the sensitivity and specificity claims of the authors. In Table 1 , it is apparent that mouth flora is not sampled with the cough technique avoiding an important mechanism of specimen contamination. In Table 2 , however, there is poor concordance between sputum and cough with regard to and , with these 2 potential pathogens isolated more commonly with Pseudomonas Staph sputum than cough. One interpretation of that observation is that sputum is more sensitive than cough for recovering potential respiratory pathogens in CF. The more frequent isolation of multiple respiratory pathogens with sputum could be interpreted the same way especially in light of the microbiome data. I am unsure where the authors believe the source of the \"excess\" and (as well as the Pseudomonas Staph specimens with multiple pathogens) is for sputum patients? Are they suggesting these \"excess\" isolates are \"contaminants\"? Comment #3: I think the authors have convincingly shown that the PneumoniaCheck\u2122 device avoids upper airway bacterial contamination during specimen collection with cough in CF patients. I think their findings with regard to the number and type of CF related respiratory pathogens and the clinical significance of those pathogens remains to be elucidated.",

The device is constructed with the intention that dead space air, presumably containing a high concentration of oral contaminants, should be collected separately, while on the other hand cough material from the lower lungs is to be collected on a specific filter constructed so that bacteria should be trapped in such a way that the material may be used for RT-PCR.Title, abstract, methods and material are clearly described as is results. Discussion is adequate and relevant.The presented results indicate high specificity with low risk of oral contaminants in cough specimens than in sputum from 20 adult CF individuals. Actually only 12 patients produced a sputum specimen, so it is a small study. However the differences were significant.Sensitivity cannot be assessed with the way the study was carried out, but comparison with other studies indicate satisfactory results. Thus, the device seems to permit improved analysis of quantitative bacteriology in lower lung specimens from CF patients. The device is described as simple to use and is suggested to be used to follow lower respiratory tract microbiology in CF patients, so that increased concentrations of significant bacterial pathogens may be noted. This may be a step forward for the management of these patients. Further studies, including pediatric studies, are needed to corroborate the findings in this study and to explore the advantages of longitudinal follow up of CF patients PCR may not suffice all the time, since bacterial resistance may have to be detected and specified in order to find an adequate treatment alternative. Needless to say this is an increasing problem.I have read this submission.
