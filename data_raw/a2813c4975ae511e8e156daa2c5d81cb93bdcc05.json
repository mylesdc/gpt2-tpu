In recent decades, Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HKHA) has been making efforts to improve the healthcare services, but there still exist some problems like unfair resource allocation and poor management, as reported by the Hong Kong medical legislative committee. One critical consequence of these problems is low healthcare efficiency of hospitals, leading to low satisfaction among patients. Moreover, HKHA also suffers from the conflict between limited resource and growing demand. An effective evaluation of HA is important for resource planning and healthcare decision making. In this paper, we propose a two-phase method to evaluate HA efficiency for reducing healthcare expenditure and improving healthcare service. Specifically, in Phase I, we measure the HKHA efficiency changes from 2000 to 2013 by applying a novel DEA-Malmquist index with undesirable factors. In Phase II, we further explore the impact of some exogenous factors (e.g., population density) on HKHA efficiency by Tobit regression model. Empirical results show that there are significant differences between the efficiencies of different hospitals and clusters. In particular, it is found that the public hospital serving in a richer district has a relatively lower efficiency. To a certain extent, this reflects the socioeconomic reality in HK that people with better economic condition prefers receiving higher quality service from the private hospitals.",

HKHA has built a world-class public healthcare infrastructure that handles around 90% of secondary and tertiary medical needs in HK. Although HKHA has been providing excellent and affordable public healthcare to citizens, it suffers from some problems like long waiting time and low service quality. In order to overcome these limitations, it is important for HA policy makers to evaluate the healthcare efficiency of hospitals, locate the bottlenecks within public healthcare service system, and establish countermeasures accordingly [1, 2] .",

Since the goals of healthcare services are always multiple, conflicting, intangible, and complex, it is difficult and intractable to set up an overall measurement of performance. Regarding the multiple inputs and outputs, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recognized as an effective nonparametric model to assess the relative efficiencies of a set of decision-making units (DMUs) [3] . Particularly, in recent decades, DEA has been widely applied to improve the productivity of healthcare-related fields in many countries [4] [5] [6] [7] , such as the United States [8] , Japan [9] , China [10] and India [11] . As discussed in [12] , DEA is more suitable for managerial decision-making, which makes it the best choice to evaluate the efficiencies of HKHA hospitals.",

An ideal scenario with the highest efficiency is producing the most outputs (e.g. the number of treated patients) using the least inputs (e.g. healthcare expenditure); and such inputs and outputs are called desirable factors. However, the maximum quantities of desirable outputs are usually bounded, given the limited desirable inputs. The reception of the patients beyond the hospital capacity will generate a congestion problem, even resulting in some unexpected mortality. A high patient mortality rate not only reflects a poor medical quality, but also may cause a dispute. Thus, the mortality rate of patient, as an undesirable output, is expected to be lower. The measurement of hospital efficiency might be biased if the undesirable factors are ignored.",

            "text": "In order to integrate undesirable factors into modeling, one straightforward idea is applying inversion transformation on the value of undesirable factors [13] . However, the transformed values are usually negative, making it difficult for DEA modeling. To circumvent this difficulty, one solution is adding a constant to the transformed undesirable factors to keep them positive [14] [15] [16] . However, the determination of this constant has a significant impact on DMU ranking and classification. Another widely used transformation is the reciprocal transformation [17] [18] [19] , but the computation complexity of this nonlinear transformation is much higher. F\u00e4re and Grosskopf [20, 21] propose an alternative approach which handles the undesirable factors by using a directional distance function. However, the form of direction vector could affect the DMU ranking. Thus, it is a critical issue to design an appropriate transformation function. In some cases, an improper transformation may generate the inverse result as it is expected. To avoid the transformation problem and preserve the original data, Liu and Sharp [22] treat the undesirable inputs as desirable outputs and vice versa, based on the physical relationship between the input and output. It has been proved as an effective approach which considers computing the operational efficiency by maximizing the undesirable inputs and desirable outputs and minimizing the desirable inputs and undesirable outputs, simultaneously. This idea is further extended by [23] , where a unified model with several different DEA approaches dealing with undesirable inputs or outputs is proposed. Besides, it is suggested that the weighted additive model [24] can be applied to handle the problem with undesirable inputs or outputs. In [25] , a slacks-based measure (SBM) is proposed, in which the unit invariant, monotone, and reference-set dependent properties are analyzed in details. The proposed SBM model outperforms CCR, BCC and Russell model in efficiency evaluation, where both the slacks for the input and the output are calculated. In [26] , a more generalized slacksbased DEA model with undesirable factors considering preference is proposed, which combines the advantages of all the factors stated above and makes several DEA models unified. The proposed method also outperforms some state-of-the-art DEA models on different databases of real applications.",

In addition, the surge of patient attendances in 2013 is mainly caused by the winter influenza season and avian influenza (H7N9). Table 4 shows the curde mortality rate of each HA hospital from 2000 to 2013. The crude mortality rate refers to the standardized hospital death rate covering inpatient and day patient deaths in HA hospitals during a year. The standardized death rate, as a standard statistical measure for temporal comparison, is calculated by applying the HA age-specific hospital death rate in the target year to the \"standard\" population in mid-2001. We observe that the Pok Oi Hospital, Ruttonjee Hospital & Tang Shiu Kin Hospital, Caritas Medical Centre, North District Hospital and Yan Chai Hospital rank top 5 regarding the value of crude mortality rate. The high crude mortality rates can be due to the facts that: (i) Pok Oi Hospital provides the elderly care for the people whose health condition and dependency level are beyond the coping We use the data in 2013 as an example to illustrate the statistical characteristics of the specific input-output factors. It is observed in Table 5 that the median value of each factor is significantly different from the average value. Furthermore, the standard deviation values are large and the maximum can be 200 times larger than the minimum, indicating that the resource utilization levels and resource allocation of the clusters are seriously unbalanced.

            "text": "Returns to scale (RTS) is the variation or change in productivity which describes the outcome from a proportionate increase of all the inputs. In DEA, an increasing return to scale (IRS) occurs when the output increases by a larger proportion than the inputs. Conversely, a decreasing return to scale (DRS) occurs when the proportion of output is less than the desired increased input during the production process. In Table 7 , the last column displays the HA hospitals' RTS in 2013. It reveals that if HKHA policy makers can properly increase the input of medical resources for the inefficient hospitals with IRS (i.e., Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and Pok Oi Hospital), these hospitals will achieve a higher service level than they expected. Notably, if HKHA policy makers continue to increase the hospital scale for the inefficient hospitals with DRS (i.e., Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital), it will be an uneconomic production process and even introduces unnecessary fiscal burden to the government. We take the year 2013 as an example, Table 8 shows the specific input-output factors, efficiency values and RTS status of each cluster. We find that KWC receives the most patient attendances; while KEC receives the least ones. In practice, HKHA allocates the medical resources for each cluster based on the patient attendances. Thus, HKHA should allocate the most medical resources for KWC and the least medical resources for KEC. However, this kind of method ignores the effect of medical case complexity of the patients. In fact, it is more reasonable to consider allocating the resources based on the complexity of the medical cases than purely on the patients' amount. In addition, the last column of Table 8 declares that the RTS status of KWC is DRS, indicating that the HKHA should reduce its medical resource inputs. Table 9 displays the slacks of each cluster measured by GSBUP, which is able to further validate the idea mentioned above. It is observed that the s D\u2212 of HKEC and HKWC with IRS is almost equal to zero; while their s G+ are not null, which means that the inefficient clusters with IRS are mainly caused by the inefficient resource utilization. On the other hand, the inefficient hospitals with DRS are mainly caused by the unfair resource allocation. This phenomenon can guide the HKHA policy makers to better control healthcare costs and improve healthcare efficiency under the service quality requirements. Considering all the slacks, the updated clusters' efficiency scores based on GSBUP-LP model can be calculated, as shown in the last column of Table 9 . The efficiency values of the comparison are displayed in Fig 2. It is observed that all the clusters' efficiencies are improved significantly, which further demonstrates that it is necessary to change the ideas for the medical investment standard. Evaluation of malmquist productivity change index. Table 10 reports HKHA hospitals' productivity change during the period 2000-2013. We observe that from 2000 to 2013, all the productivities of hospitals have made significant improvement. There are two major reasons: (i) SARS outbreak and (ii) Health services fees' reformation. The first diagnosed patient with SARS was on 21 February 2003 and the disease had widely spread in HK within just two weeks. The peak of the epidemic started from 24 March 2003, and there was a rapid influx of infected residents in HA hospitals, particularly the United Christian Hospital which was soon overwhelmed. Therefore, its productivity improves by 17.87%, particularly, the TEC and FS improve by 4.77% and 13.76%, respectively (see Table 11 ). On 29 March 2003, the Government and HA decided to designate the Princess Margret Hospital, due to its specialty in treating infectious disease, to receive SARS patients after diverting all its existing patients to other hospitals. Thus, its FS only improves by 1.81%. However, since the government intensified a strong technical support to the Princess Margret Hospital for resisting SARS, its TEC improves by 9.87% during 2000-2003 (see Table 11 ). Besides, the speed of the patient flow increase was unexpected. The additional manpower from other hospitals was deployed to Princess Margret Hospital for help, which is to reduce the medical resources input equivalently for the other hospitals. With the contribution from other hospitals to share the workload, the designation of Princess Margret Hospital officially ended on 11 April 2003. Furthermore, with the assistance of the necessary operational and information technology systems, a revised public hospital fees structure was implemented at the beginning of 2003 together with an enhanced waiver mechanism to better provide the available public resources to those in need. Along with the soaring SARS attendances, there is improvement in TEC for almost all the hospitals. Not surprisingly, the HKHA hospital productivity regresses from 2003 to 2007, since SARS has been gradually defeated during this period, and the patient attendances decrease a lot. In the periods, 2007-2010 and 2010-2013, the HKHA average productivity has generally increased except St. John Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and North District Hospital, which are not the core and mainstream hospitals in HK. In particular, the St. John Hospital provides health services for the citizens living on the Cheung Chau Island, which is a geographically isolated place. Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and North District Hospital were once voted as the one with the highest emergency surgery mortality rates, therefore, their average TEC declines by 1.84% and 1.34% during 2007-2013 (see Table 11 ). In addition to the observations stated above, it is indicated in Table 10 that the productivity and FS of Pok Oi Hospital improve a lot during 2007-2013, as it has provided ED services since 2010.",

In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimation toolbox in R [44] to obtain the Tobit regression results, as presented in Table 13 . Firstly, the poverty situation of persons with disabilities has a positive influence on HA hospital efficiency; while median monthly domestic household income and education level affect the environmental efficiency negatively. Since the median income of each cluster has almost no relationship with population density (i.e., correlation coefficient = 0.03), the empirical results reveal an interesting phenomenon: the public hospitals that serve in a richer district, has a relatively lower efficiency in HK, since people with higher degree of education and income prefer to accepting higher quality service from the private hospitals. Secondly, the proportion of population aged over 65 and HA hospital efficiency has a negative correlation, because the elderly are more likely to suffer from life-threatening diseases. Many elderly patients are physically too weak to see the doctors. Moreover, one out of three elderly HK residents lives under poverty or disabilities, so they are usually unable to take good care of themselves once in sick. In other words, the aged population might increase the complications and the mortality rate. Therefore, the aged population have a negative correlation with the HA hospital efficiency.",
