            "text": "Multiple subtypes of avian influenza (AI) and novel reassortants are frequently isolated from live bird markets (LBMs). However, our understanding of the drivers of persistence of multiple AI subtypes is limited. We propose a stochastic model of AI transmission within an LBM that incorporates market size, turnover rate and the balance of direct versus environmental transmissibility. We investigate the relationship between these factors and the critical community size (CCS) for the persistence of single and multiple AI strains within an LBM. We fit different models of seeding from farms to two-strain surveillance data collected from Shantou, China. For a single strain and plausible estimates for continuous turnover rates and transmissibility, the CCS was approximately 11 800 birds, only a 4.2% increase in this estimate was needed to ensure persistence of the co-infecting strains (two strains in a single host). Precise values of CCS estimates were sensitive to changes in market turnover rate and duration of the latent period. Assuming a gradual daily sell rate of birds the estimated CCS was higher than when an instantaneous selling rate was assumed. We were able to reproduce prevalence dynamics similar to observations from a single market in China with infection seeded every 5-15 days, and a maximum non-seeding duration of 80 days. Our findings suggest that persistence of co-infections is more likely to be owing to sequential infection of single strains rather than ongoing transmission of both strains concurrently. In any given system for a fixed set of ecological and epidemiological conditions, there is an LBM size below which the risk of sustained co-circulation is low and which may suggest a clear policy opportunity to reduce the frequency of influenza co-infection in poultry.",

LBMs are a known source of AI in which high densities of poultry, unhygienic conditions, infected drinking water and dust particles all serve to amplify transmission [3] [4] [5] [6] . The continuous introduction of naive birds into LBMs replacing those sold ensures that the pool of hosts susceptible to infection is continuously replenished, facilitating ongoing transmission of AI within LBMs. In addition, the movement of humans and poultry between farms and markets across different geographical areas further contributes to the spread of multiple AI strains [3, 5] .",

While the concept has been used for infectious diseases of humans for many years [8] and also within wildlife populations [9] it has not been applied to the persistence of AI in a multistrain system. The persistence of AI within LBMs is of public health and evolutionary importance; if multiple different AI strains persist in LBMs, there is greater opportunity for coinfection, where a co-infection is the presence of at least two independent viruses within a single host. Frequent co-infections with genetically distinct viruses increase the opportunity for novel viruses to be generated through reassortment.",

Because co-infection of a host with two different strains is a necessary prerequisite for reassortment to occur, the higher the number of co-infection events that occur, the greater the chance that transmissible and pathogenic novel reassortant progeny will be generated. Here, we use the word strain to describe a distinct lineage that may reassort with another lineage. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the frequency of co-infection in LBMs and the factors driving persistence [16] . A better understanding of factors that predict the persistence of multiple strains would provide a foundation for advancing our ability to predict the risk of reassortment. Worryingly, an increasing number of studies are showing that reassortment between different AI subtypes and human endemic subtypes can readily occur [17, 18] and spillover of AI infections into the human population continue to be reported as a consequence of exposure to LBMs.",

Interactions and importations between external farms and the market were modelled such that at one time point within a day, birds would be brought into the market and at the same time point approximately the same proportion were sold onwards (i.e. instantaneous turnover). As turnover rates within markets remain poorly quantified, we also examined the effects of different fixed turnover rates (above and below 50%) on our model outcomes. We assumed the market population size remained approximately constant, which is the prevailing opinion of fieldworkers as physical space is a scarce resource within LBMs and is therefore highly utilized [19, 20] . However, although the market population may be approximately constant across days (except at major holidays), it is unlikely to be constant throughout the course of a day-i.e. most birds come in in the morning (highest population size) and gradually leave throughout the day (population size decreases gradually throughout the day). Thus, we also evaluated how fluctuations in population throughout the day impacted CCS estimates. Insights from the variable population sizes throughout the day could be extrapolated to interpret the effects of variable population sizes during holiday seasons.",

I birds were infectious to other birds, and temporarily immune to infection with a second strain [24, 25] as a consequence of the innate immune response to infection [26] . In terms of adaptive immunity, R birds were fully recovered, and immune to re-infection with the same strain (i.e. full homologous immunity) but were susceptible to infection with a second strain with the same probability as fully susceptible hosts (S) (no cross-immunity).

The dynamics of infection and circulating strains can vary markedly between different years, therefore we considered persistence only within a single year. The definition for the persistence of co-infecting strains is more complicated. Even if direct transmission of the co-infecting strain fades out, if both individual strains are still circulating, direct transmission of the co-infecting strains can re-emerge. Thus, we calculate the CCS for the persistence of the co-infecting strains by considering the frequency with which a single introduction of both strains separately results in an epidemic of the co-infecting strains which persists for at least 1 year, ensuring the number of birds infected with strain A and B (individually), or strain AB is greater than 1 at the end of the year. The CCS was estimated through simulation. As variation in the population size directly impacted R 0 , we explored how the CCS varied when other components of R 0 were altered. For the single-strain CCS, we increased the withinflock and environmental transmissibility, infectious period, viral decay and shedding rates to 25% and 75% above the baseline values. For the co-infecting strains CCS we decreased all aforementioned parameters by 25% for the co-infecting strains and then increased all aforementioned parameters for one of the founding strains by 75%.

With a 25% decrease in the baseline parameters of the coinfecting strains, the estimated CCS was similar to the baseline estimates assuming instantaneous turnover (figure 3c). When the instantaneous turnover rate was 60% or higher, the CCS for all three levels of transmissibility was similar, and tended to be approximately 500 birds greater than for a single strain ( figure 3c,d) . Generally, across all market turnover rates only a small increase in the CCS for the co-infecting strains was seen relative to the single strain whether turnover was instantaneous or gradual (figure 3c,d).

We judged consistency by the number of model realizations that were able to simultaneously match all the summary statistics (table 1) . Models 1 and 2 scored the same for overall matching (6 out of 1000). We chose model 2 because model 1 had a very low number of matches to the number of strain 1 peaks. We present a random subset of four realizations obtained from model 2 (electronic supplementary material, figure S9 ). Models 1 and 5 were the next best performing. Both models drew prevalence values between 0 and 70% every 1-30 days, with a maximum non-seeding duration of 80 and 100 days, for models 1 and 5, respectively. Therefore, introduction of a relatively high prevalence of infection and a number of consecutive infection seeding days (greater than 5) are likely to be important features of the system. Models for which the range of seeding days was a maximum of 12 days (models 6-10), were unable to capture the calculated correlation between the two circulating strains. Models 9 and 10 had the shortest range of seeding and non-seeding days, where infection was seeded between every 1-12 days and not seeded every 2-40 days. This suggests frequent seeding and non-seeding intervals at high levels of prevalence may be able to capture the high prevalence of infection in the data (table 1), but not the dynamic interplay between two circulating strains. For models 6-10 the inability to capture some summary statistics resulted in none of these models being able to satisfy all criteria across the four statistics simultaneously (table 1) . If the stringency of the criteria were reduced to assess the intersection of realizations between two or three summary statistics, very limited overlap between statistics for the same model were seen (electronic supplementary material, table S6).",

            "text": "The trade of live birds in and between different LBMs is of cultural importance in mainland China [2] , in addition to other regions in South East Asia and some parts of Africa. Periodic closure of LBMs can halt the transmission of AI, particularly with respect to preventing new human cases [35] , however, in the absence of routine cleaning, market rest days and ensuring that birds come into the market infection free, wLBMs will continue to amplify AI. The simultaneous persistence of multiple strains within the market increases the probability that a bird will become co-infected. When co-infection risk is high, the risk of reassortment is increased, highlighting the important role that LBMs may play in the emergence of novel influenza A lineages. Our results demonstrate the importance of controlling the size of the market population to prevent self-sustaining transmission, but that uncertainty remains in terms of characterizing the ecology of LBMs in China.",

Overall, the prevalence of both strains was much higher in 2006 compared with 2005, although despite this the overall prevalence of co-infection with both strains was low. rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc.

Increases in the values of b wf , b env and viral shedding rate (v) increased the probability of persistence for a single strain, while increases in the rate of viral decay (h) decreased the probability of persistence. All parameter values are presented in the electronic supplementary material, table S1. Variation in the probability of persistence across the range of values evaluated reduced as the average daily population size of the market (N) increased. When b wf was 0.2 and N\u00bc 2000 birds the probability of persistence was 0.05; when N \u00bc 15 000 the probability of persistence was 0.7. Probability of infection persistence for four key model parameters: b wf , viral decay rate (h), viral shedding rate (v) and b env across a range of values identified in the literature, considering a range of average population sizes from 2000 to 15 000 birds. We calculated the standard deviation of the mean for the probability of persistence for each range of parameter values provided, we used + standard deviation of the mean to calculate the uncertainty about the mean for all parameters, indicated by the polygon.
