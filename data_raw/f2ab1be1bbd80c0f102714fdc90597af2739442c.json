The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes. Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.",

            "text": "Since 1997, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viral strain has caused severe disease in poultry and wild birds. Although H5N1 has not spread widely in humans, sporadic infections have been seen throughout countries of eastern Asia, the Middle East and Africa. To date, there have been more than 445 confirmed human cases of H5N1, with 263 deaths (59% mortality rate) reported by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_12_11/en/index.html). In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had physical contact with infected birds. While the primary mode of transmission may be animal-to-human, the concern remains that this virus may evolve into a strain capable of human-to-human transmission. Vaccination offers a practical and effective measure for controlling the spread of this highly pathogenic virus. The threat posed by emerging strains of influenza is unpredictable and varies among countries, as evidenced by the recent swine origin H1N1 pandemic, highlighting the need for improved vaccines that can confer broad protection against multiple viral strains and various influenza A subtypes.",

Two highly conserved influenza viral proteins, NP and M2, have been widely targeted as possible broadly protective vaccine candidates [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The main function of the nucleoprotein is encapsidation of the viral genome to form a ribonucleoprotein particle for transcription and packaging. NP also interacts with other viral proteins (PB1, PB2, and M1) and cellular proteins (Importin a, F-actin, CRM1/exportin1) for viral transcription control and nuclear transportation control [10] . M2 is responsible for protein translocation, and is expressed at a high density in the plasma membrane of infected cells in tetramer forms. This ion channel protein is also a target for the antiviral drugs amantidine and rimantadine, which control viral replication and have been used for influenza prophylaxis and treatment [11] .",

However, the mouse model is not ideal for the evaluation of H5N1 infection and vaccines due to differences in HA receptor specificity and distribution, influenza pathogenicity, as well as clinical symptomatology [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Infection in the ferret shows greater similarity to human infection in terms of anatomical distribution and disease. Outbred ferrets exhibit severe lethargy, fever, weight loss, and transient lymphopenia, as well as viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract, brain, and multiple systemic organs after infection with various strains of H5N1 virus. Thus, this model is widely considered to be more reflective of human influenza infection [13, 18, 19] . While we continued to evaluate the protective efficacy of NP and M2 in the mouse model, we extended our investigation into the ferret model in this study.",

Vaxfectin-formulated DNA vaccine encoding NP+M2 protected mice, but against high challenge doses of H5N1 virus in ferrets it only delayed time to illness and death [20] . However, triple prime with rAd boost regimens of NP in combination with M2 have been shown to protect ferrets against the H5N1 virus, albeit at a relatively low challenge dose [21] . In this study, we evaluated protective immunity induced by NP and M2 alone or in combination with HA in a triple prime, rAd boost regimen against high dose lethal H5N1 challenge. Initially, we tested the ability of DNA immunization with HA alone, NP alone, HA+NP, and HA+NP+M2 to protect against high doses of lethal H5N1 challenge in mice. We then assessed the ability of NP and M2, alone or in combination, to protect ferrets against a high challenge dose of lethal H5N1 virus, when delivered in a triple DNA prime, rAd5 boost regimen. We compared these groups to ferrets immunized with HA alone or in combination with NP+M2.",

All HA, NP and M2 genes are from A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004. The numbers of animals used in our studies were as follows: (a) 4 animals for each group of NP and M2 alone, (b) 5 animals for the NP+M2 and the negative control group, (c) in another experiment, 4 animals for all three groups: HA alone, HA+NP+M2 and the vector control. The ferrets were immunized three times with a total of 250 mg plasmid DNA in 500 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) intramuscularly in the quadriceps muscle at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. For the single component plasmid group, each animal received 83 mg DNA for each plasmid with 167 mg of control vector as filler DNA (total 250 mg). For the 2 plasmid combination group (e.g. NP+M2), 83 mg of each NP and M2 plasmid with 83 mg control vector was used (total 250 mg). For the 3 plasmid combination group (HA+NP+M2), 83 mg of each three plasmid DNA was used as total DNA remained the same (total 250 mg). At week 9, the ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with 10 10 particles of recombinant adenoviruses expressing HA, NP, M2, or in different combinations similar to their DNA immunization combinations. Serum was collected 10 days after the last vaccination. The DNA and adenovirus immunizations were conducted at BioQual, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Nine to ten weeks after the adenovirus boost, the immunized ferrets were challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus, which has the identical NP and M2 amino acid sequence as that of the immunized strain A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) as previously described [19] . Briefly, 2 days prior to infection, baseline serum, body temperature, and weight measurements of the ferrets were obtained. After the ferrets were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (24 mg/kg), xylazine (2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg) cocktail, they were inoculated intranasally with 10 7 EID 50 of virus in 1 ml of PBS. The ferrets were monitored for changes in body temperature and weight and the presence of the following clinical symptoms: sneezing, lethargy, anorexia, nasal or ocular discharge, dyspnea, diarrhea, and neurological dysfunction. Body temperatures were measured using an implantable subcutaneous temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE). Viral titers were measured in nasal washes collected on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection from anesthetized ferrets as previously described [6] . The nasal washes were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at 270uC until they were processed. Viral titers in the nasal washes were determined in eggs as described above. Any ferret that lost more than 25% of its body weight or exhibited neurological dysfunction was euthanized and submitted to postmortem examination. Body weight, clinical symptoms, signs of morbidity, and survival were monitored for 7 or up to 13 days. The statistical significance of differences in survival between groups was determined using a log-rank test.",

In this study, mice were immunized with DNA vaccines encoding HA alone, NP alone, HA+NP, and HA+NP+M2. All HA-containing groups and the M2-containing group generated significant antibody responses against HA and M2 proteins, respectively. However, only the HA+NP group elicited a response against NP protein, and that was marginally significant at best. Moreover, while all HA-containing groups were protected against lethal H5N1 challenge with a survival rate of at least 70%, immunization with NP alone did not protect mice from lethal H5N1 challenge (Figure 3) . Neutralization was determined by lentiviral inhibition assay, hemagglutinin inhibition assay, and microneutralization assay. Sera from the indicated mouse and ferret immunizations with the indicated viral antigens by DNA alone or DNA/rAd5 before the viral challenge were evaluated by pseudotyped lentiviral inhibition, hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI), and microneutralization assays (MN).

            "text": "Previous studies with NP immunization have yielded mixed results, likely dependent on the mode of gene-based vaccination and on the dose of challenge virus. Though the first studies using NP DNA immunization conferred protection against lethal influenza challenge [5, 48] , in retrospect, this result may be seen with relatively low challenge doses. In a more recent study, a challenge dose that overcame NP DNA vaccine protection was similar to the amount used here [2] . NP immunization with DNA/ rAd derived from H1N1 strain A/PR/8 resulted in protection in mice against challenge with a heterologous virus strain, H5N1 A/ HK/156, but no protection was seen against a more virulent strain, A/HK/483 [1] . It appears that protection afforded by immunization with NP in mice diminishes markedly as the dose and virulence of the challenge virus increase. However, DNA vaccination with NP in combination with M2 has been shown to protect mice in both Vaxfectin formulations and rAd-boost regimens [7, 20, 21] . While we did not investigate M2 alone in mice, a previous study has shown that vaccination with M2 alone is capable of protecting mice against heterologous strains of influenza virus challenge, including H5N1 [9] .",

This is suggestive of other useful mechanisms of protection, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, although this was not assessed in our study.

However, in ferrets, in the absence of HA, this combination only resulted in delayed illness and death [20] . Price et al. showed that NP+M2 protects ferrets against H5N1 in a triple-prime rAd boost regimen similar to the one used here, but this difference in results may be due to the higher dose of DNA in the primary immunization (ten-fold greater than the present study) as well as a much lower viral challenge dose (56LD 50 [21] compared to 3610 5 6LD 50 in this study). However, due to differences in experimental parameters such as the immunization regimen and assay standardization, direct comparisons of NP and M2 immune responses between studies are difficult. In addition, different vaccinations may alter various antibody and cellular immune responses which may affect the protective immunity in various animal models. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests while NP or NP+M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low dose viral challenges in ferrets, they are insufficient against high challenge doses of HPAI. On the other hand, HA elicits effective immune protection even against very high HPAI viral challenge doses. Although vaccines encoding NP or M2 alone are not required for protection against H5N1, they could potentially augment HA-encoded vaccines, particularly when there is a mismatch between the vaccine and viral HA proteins. Studies in mice have shown that M2 antibodies may help to reduce viral replication [8, 9, 52, 53] , while studies in ferrets have shown M2 to be associated with reductions in viral recovery [20, 54] . However, based on our H5N1 challenge results in ferrets, HA DNA immunization is superior to NP and M2 DNA immunization in terms of protection. These highly conserved viral genes may require combinatorial vaccination with HA to be suitable candidates for universal influenza vaccines.",
