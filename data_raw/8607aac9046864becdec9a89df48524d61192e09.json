            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic virus that is transmitted by bats to humans and to pigs, causing severe respiratory disease and often fatal encephalitis. Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice after vaccination with the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides. the first time NiV emerged in southern India [2] . Two strains of NiV have been identified, Malaysia and Bangladesh strains, which share 91.8% sequence homology [3] . NiV causes severe respiratory disease and encephalitis [4] [5] [6] , with average case fatality rates (CFR) of 40-75% [7] . Moreover, long-term neurological sequelae and even relapse of encephalitis are observed in many survivors of infections with both strains of NiV [8] [9] [10] .",

The glycoproteins of both viruses bind to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 [19] [20] [21] [22] , which are highly conserved across many species [23] . To date, the most promising therapeutic approach against Henipavirus infection is the one based on the application of the experimental human monoclonal antibody m102.4, which binds the ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 receptor-binding site on the glycoproteins of HeV (HeV-G) and NiV (NiV-G) [24] .

These candidate vaccines include recombinant viruses developed using vaccinia virus [28], canarypox [29], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [30-34], rabies virus [35], measles virus [36], and adenovirus platforms [37, 38] . To date, the only licensed Henipavirus vaccine is the equine vaccine against HeV, Equivac \u00ae HeV, which was approved for use in horses in Australia in 2012 [39]. This vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which comprises the soluble form of HeV-G (HeVsG) [19, [39] [40] [41] . The subunit HeVsG vaccine has been shown to protect against NiV in cats [42], ferrets [43] , and non-human primates [44], but not in pigs [45] . The ability of HeVsG to protect against NiV infection in some animal models warrants the evaluation of a vaccine that contains a soluble form of NiV glycoprotein G.",

Importantly, vaccination of mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) elicited readily detectable NiV-G-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. We identified a potential H2-b-restricted epitope in the NiV-G that stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T cells and a potential H2-IAb-restricted epitope that stimulated antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Interestingly, in comparison with full-length NiV-G, the soluble antigen NiVsG induced significantly stronger epitope-specific T cell responses.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic viral DNA served to confirm the genetic identity and genomic stability of the MVA vector viruses. The replicative capacity of the recombinant MVA-NiV viruses compared with nonrecombinant MVA was tested by multi-step growth experiments in CEF and human HeLa cells.

Our peptide library consisted of 15mer peptides that overlapped by 11mer. All peptides were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific as crude material (<50% purity) on a 1-4 mg scale. The two-dimensional peptide pool matrix system was used for screening [56, 57] . Briefly, peptides were organized into two-dimensional matrix peptide pools (H1-H10 and V1-V11) containing 11-13 peptides. For mapping of potential CD8 T cell epitopes in positive 15mer peptides, every possible sequence of peptides 8-11mer in length was determined. Theoretical peptides were then analyzed for binding to the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele H2-b using the SYFPEITHI database. The peptides of each amino acid sequence length were synthesized and tested. For identification of CD4 T cell epitopes, MHC class II binding predictions were performed on 15mer peptides found within positive peptide pools identified by IFN-\u03b3 Enzyme-Linked Immunospot assay (ELISPOT). Using the MHC Class II Binding, T Cell Epitope Prediction resource of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, https://www.iedb.org/), peptides restricted to mouse MHC class II allele H2-IAb were analyzed using \"IEDB Recommended\" prediction method [58] . The most promising candidates were then chosen for further experimental epitope prediction studies. All peptides were dissolved to a concentration of 2 mg/mL in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until use. T cell analysis by ELISPOT was performed as described previously [55] . Briefly, spleens were collected from mice 8 days after the final immunization. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by teasing spleens through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer (Falcon \u00ae Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Red blood cells (RBC) were removed using Red Cell Lysis Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), and cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI-10, which consisted of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). For experiments that required CD4 and CD8 T cell purification, splenocytes were incubated with mouse CD4 and CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and processed by negative selection using the QuadroMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec).",

These synthetic gene sequences were placed under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus-specific promoters Pvgf or PmH5 and introduced into the MVA genome by homologous recombination targeting the intergenic site between the essential MVA genes 069 and 070L. The clonal isolation of the recombinant viruses MVA-NiVsG and MVA-NiV-G was facilitated by the co-production of the green fluorescent reporter protein (GFP), as previously described [54] . The final recombinant viruses containing the NiV-G gene sequences (MVA-NiV-G and MVA-NiVsG) were obtained after removal of the GFP reporter gene by intragenomic homologous recombination ( Figure S1A , marker gene deletion). To verify the identity of the desired modification, we performed the standard quality control experiments as described previously [54] . PCR analysis of viral genomic DNA confirmed the proper insertion of the recombinant gene sequences at the target site in the genome of MVA (Figure S1B-E) and the genetic characteristics and stability of the recombinant MVA viruses. We assessed the growth behavior of the recombinant viruses MVA-NiVsG and MVA-NiV-G in multi-step growth analyses in human HeLa cells and primary CEF, which are routinely used for amplification of recombinant MVA in vaccine manufacturing ( Figure S1F ). MVA-NiVsG and MVA-NiV-G efficiently replicated in CEF and demonstrated an increase of infectivity titers that was comparable to that obtained with nonrecombinant MVA. However, MVA-NiV-G and MVA-NiVsG did not productively grow in human HeLa cells, confirming that they had retained the characteristic replication deficiency of MVA in cells of mammalian origin. These findings corroborated the expected MVA phenotype and confirmed that the recombinant viruses could be handled under laboratory conditions of biosafety level 1. Of note, we originally generated another recombinant MVA virus using the synthetic early-late promoter PmH5 for transcriptional control of recombinant gene expression and production of the full-length NiV-G protein. However, upon growth testing, this candidate virus failed to reach levels of infectious progeny in CEF to be eligible for large-scale amplification as needed for vaccine production processes.",

NiV-G is a 602 amino acid long protein consisting of an N-terminal internal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal external domain ( Figure 1A ). For NiVsG protein, an internal leader sequence and three amino acid linkers have replaced the internal and transmembrane domains ( Figure 1A ), as described previously [19, 48] . We assessed the correct expression and studied the cellular localization of the NiV-G and NiVsG by immunofluorescence microscopy of MVA-NiV-infected cells immunolabeled with anti-NiV-G antibody, followed by a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (300 nM). As anticipated, we observed different patterns of green fluorescence, with varying cellular localizations depending on the MVA-NiV construct. Green fluorescence, specific for NiV-G, was identified in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells infected with MVA-NiV-G ( Figure 1B ), but not in MVA-infected or mock control cells. This data confirmed that the recombinant full-length NiV-G protein encoded by MVA-NiV-G was indeed anchored on the cell surface. In contrast, the NiV-G-specific staining in cells infected with MVA-NiVsG virus appeared to be predominantly located within the cells and was readily detected after permeabilization. As anticipated, we failed to detect NiVsG in considerable amounts without permeabilization, confirming that NiVsG was not expressed on the cell surface ( Figure 1B) .",

Total cell lysates or culture supernatants obtained from CEF and HeLa cultures infected with recombinant MVA virus were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. We specifically detected a protein with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 72-75 kDa in lysates from CEF cells and HeLa cells infected either with MVA-NiV-G or MVA-NiVsG ( Figure 1C ). In the cell lysates, the glycoprotein was first detectable at 4 h post-infection. Since the NiVsG gene encoding sequences were modified to result in the secreted soluble version (sG), we performed additional Western blot experiments to determine whether the protein still maintained glycosylation sites comparable to wild-type NiV-G. Lysates and supernatants obtained from cultures of DF-1 cells infected with MVA-NiVsG were treated with enzymes that deglycosylate proteins and analyzed by western blotting. Enzyme treatment resulted in a reduction in the molecular mass of recombinant NiVsG protein from 70-75 kDa to 58-60 kDa ( Figure 1D ), matching the expected size of unmodified G protein. This suggested that recombinant NiVsG has retained the normal glycosylation pattern of wild-type NiV-G.",

We pooled overlapping peptides using a twodimensional peptide matrix system ( Figure 3A ) and screened for their ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 by ELISPOT. IFN-\u03b3 production above background levels was observed after stimulation with 2 out of the 21 peptide pools tested ( Figure 3B ). CD8 T cells from mice immunized with MVA-NiVsG, but not the MVA and mock groups, showed elevated numbers of IFN-\u03b3 spot-forming counts (SFC) after stimulation with peptide pools V1 and H1 ( Figure 3B ). In the next step, the peptides within the V1 and H1 peptide pools were used to characterize the T cell epitope specificities in more detail. For this, pools V1 (V1A and V1B) and H1 (H1A and H1B) were subdivided into subpools containing 5-7 peptides each. Since two 15mer peptides were shared between the pools, #1 (G73-87 = YTRSTDNQAVIKDAL) and #2 (G77-91 = TDNQAVIKDALQGIQ), these peptides were also tested separately. For this experiment, we used an identical immunization protocol and splenic CD8 T cell purification procedure. CD8 T cells from these mice were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides #1 and #2. Stimulation with the subpools H1A and V1A resulted in IFN-\u03b3 production above background levels in the MVA-NiVsG group with IFN-\u03b3 SFC mean \u00b1 SEM values of 455 \u00b1 99 and 271 \u00b1 74 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 splenocytes, respectively ( Figure 1C ). Subpools H1B and V1B, however, did not stimulate CD8 T cells in the MVA-NiVsG group. Stimulation of CD8 T cells with individual peptides #1 and #2, which were present in subpools H1A and V1A, resulted in different outcomes. IFN-\u03b3 production above the background was observed in cultures stimulated with #1 (mean = 349 \u00b1 87 SFC/10 6 cells), but not #2, in the MVA-NiVsG group. These data suggested that the 15mer peptide #1 contained peptide sequences that stimulated NiV-G-specific CD8 T cells. ",

            "text": "Currently, there is only limited information available on NiV-specific T cell immunity. In order to characterize the NiV-G-specific T cell response induced by our candidate vaccines, we first aimed to identify NiV-G polyprotein-specific T cell epitopes. IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background (MHC I = H2-Db/H2-Kb (H2-b) and MHC II = H2-IAb) were immunized twice with the MVA-NiVsG candidate vaccine via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route, and splenocytes were prepared 8 days after the final inoculation, CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified and restimulated with overlapping 15mer peptides corresponding to the NiV-G protein. We pooled overlapping peptides using a two-dimensional peptide matrix system ( Figure 3A ) and screened for their ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 by ELISPOT. IFN-\u03b3 production above background levels was observed after stimulation with 2 out of the 21 peptide pools tested ( Figure 3B ). CD8 T cells from mice immunized with MVA-NiVsG, but not the MVA and mock groups, showed elevated numbers of IFN-\u03b3 spot-forming counts (SFC) after stimulation with peptide pools V1 and H1 ( Figure 3B ). In the next step, the peptides within the V1 and H1 peptide pools were used to characterize the T cell epitope specificities in more detail. For this, pools V1 (V1A and V1B) and H1 (H1A and H1B) were subdivided into subpools containing 5-7 peptides each. Since two 15mer peptides were shared between the pools, #1 (G 73-87 = YTRSTDNQAVIKDAL) and #2 (G 77-91 = TDNQAVIKDALQGIQ), these peptides were also tested separately. For this experiment, we used an identical immunization protocol and splenic CD8 T cell purification procedure. CD8 T cells from these mice were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides #1 and #2. Stimulation with the subpools H1A and V1A resulted in IFN-\u03b3 production above background levels in the MVA-NiVsG group with IFN-\u03b3 SFC mean \u00b1 SEM values of 455 \u00b1 99 and 271 \u00b1 74 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 splenocytes, respectively ( Figure 1C ). Subpools H1B and V1B, however, did not stimulate CD8 T cells in the MVA-NiVsG group. Stimulation of CD8 T cells with individual peptides #1 and #2, which were present in subpools H1A and V1A, resulted in different outcomes. IFN-\u03b3 production above the background was observed in cultures stimulated with #1 (mean = 349 \u00b1 87 SFC/10 6 cells), but not #2, in the MVA-NiVsG group. These data suggested that the 15mer peptide #1 contained peptide sequences that stimulated NiV-G-specific CD8 T cells. Graphs shows IFN-\u03b3 SFC (spot-forming counts) of stimulated CD8 T cells. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Asterisks represent statistically significant overall differences for a specific peptide subpool or individual peptide. * p < 0.05.",

            "text": "To map the potential CD8 T cell epitope within the NiV-G protein in more detail, we dissected the 15mer peptide #1 into every possible 8-11mer sequence ( Figure 4A ). The sequences were then analyzed for H2-b binding computationally using the SYFPEITHI database, and the four best of each amino acid length were chosen (Table 1) . To test these peptides, we immunized IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice twice with MVA-NiVsG via the i.p. route and analyzed total splenocyte activation by ELISPOT assay. Of the sixteen 8-11mer overlapping peptides tested, eight resulted in the stimulation of measurable IFN-\u03b3 in the MVA-NiVsG group ( Figure 4B ). The positive peptides included three 11mer in length (11.1, 11.2, and 11.3), two 10mer in length (10.2 and 10.3), two 9mer in length (9.3 and 9.4), and one 8mer in length (8.4) ( Figure 4B ). The mean IFN-\u03b3 SFC value was lower for cells stimulated with peptide 8.4 relative to peptide 9.3. The mean values for the MVA-NiVsG group were 645 \u00b1 112 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 cells for peptide 9.3 and 380 \u00b1 85 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 for peptide 8.4. Comparative analysis of the positive peptide sequences demonstrated that the sequence of peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) was present in all positive 10-11mer peptides (Table 1 ). In addition, the sequence of peptide 8.4 (STDNQAVI) was present in the eight positive peptides. To characterize the induction of IFN-\u03b3 SFC by these peptides in more detail, IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice were vaccinated twice via the i.m. route, a commonly used route for human vaccinations, and in vitro stimulated splenocytes were analyzed by ELISPOT assay. For this experiment, we chose the most promising peptides of each amino acid sequence length (peptides 8.4, 9.3, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, and 11.2). The six peptides tested significantly stimulated the activation of IFN-\u03b3 in the MVA-NiVsG group relative to the MVA and PBS controls ( Figure 4C ). Mean SFC values, however, did not show statistically significant variations between each individual peptide. Importantly, the mean SFC value for peptide 9.3 was again nonsignificantly elevated relative to peptide 8.4 (mean \u00b1 SEM = 663 \u00b1 213 and 305 \u00b1 148 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 cells respectively). Consequently, we chose peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) (mean = 906 \u00b1 109 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 cells) as a potential H2-b-restricted epitope candidate of NiV-G ( Table 2 ). The alignment of peptide 9.3 to the full sequence of NiV-G is shown in Figure S3 . (11.1, 11.2, 10.2, 10.3, 9.3, 8.4) . Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.

In contrast to CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes, the IFN-\u03b3 SFC signals in these cultures were lower (Figures 3B and 6A) . In order to determine definitively which peptide pools were above background levels, we selected a cut off value of 20 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/10 6 cells ( Figure 6A , grey line). Mean IFN-\u03b3 SFC values above background were observed in 8 out of the 21 pools (pools H3, H4, V2, V3, V5, V6, V9, and V11) ( Figure 6A ). In order to identify potential CD4 T cell epitopes of H2-IAb, we performed a computational analysis of the 15mer peptides in the five most positive peptide pools measured by ELISPOT assay (pools H3, H4, V3, V6, and V9). Using MHC II binding predictions obtained from the IEDB online resource, we found two promising peptides. These peptides were #49 (LFMTNVWTPPNPNTV) and #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS) ( Table 2 ). Next, we used IFN-\u03b3 ICS to identify directly antigen-specific CD4 T cells after stimulation with these peptides. For this, splenocytes from mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-NiV-G or MVA-NiVsG were stimulated with peptides #49 and #50 and analyzed by flow cytometry. A small population of peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells was observed in the MVA-NiVsG and MVA-NiV-G groups ( Figure 6B ). Due to low frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, we chose a cut off value of 0.1% to differentiate between positive signals and background. Overall, CD4 T cells from the MVA-NiVsG group had a frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ above the cut off relative to MVA-NiV-G group ( Figure 6C ). The mean percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells for the two peptides was 0.09-0.17% and 0.04-0.07% for MVA-NiVsG and MVA-NiV-G, respectively. Moreover, the frequency and absolute number of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells in peptide #50 stimulated cultures was significantly higher in the MVA-NiVsG group when compared with the MVA-NiV-G group (mean = 290 \u00b1 65 and 140 \u00b1 46 cells/10 6 splenocytes respectively). For peptide #49, MVA-NiVsG vaccinated mice showed a significantly elevated frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells only. In conclusion, our data indicate that peptide #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS) is a promising H2-IAb-restricted CD4 T cell epitope candidate of NiV-G. The alignment of the peptide to the full amino acid sequence of wild-type NiV-G is shown in Figure S3 .",

            "text": "The continuous threat of suddenly emerging NiV outbreaks, particularly in Bangladesh and India, demonstrate the need for countermeasure approaches ready to use in an immediate public health response. At present, there are no licensed NiV vaccines for use in humans available. The existence of a NiV candidate vaccine should significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus in the case of an outbreak scenario. There are some experimental NiV vaccines that have already been tested in different preclinical animal models. The major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. In those studies, efficacy has been mostly associated with the generation of NiV-specific antibodies, and immune monitoring is mainly relying on the detection of virus-neutralizing antibodies [31, 60, 61] . However, there is relatively little known about the induction and the relevance of NiV-specific cellular immune responses. In that context, the availability of appropriate tools to investigate the role of T cells in NiV-specific immunity is an important prerequisite in the development of new vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, it will be indispensable to monitor in animal models the contribution of virus-specific T cells to protective immunity but also to potential NiV antigen-specific immune pathology.",

            "text": "Here, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype H2-b-restricted peptide epitope in the NiV-G protein by stimulating T cells from MVA\u2212NiVsG vaccinated IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice with a two-dimensional (2D) matrix pool of overlapping peptides. IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice have been already established as a valuable preclinical animal model for NiV infection with a LD 50 of 8 \u00d7 10 3 pfu after intraperitoneal challenge infection [15] . Moreover, in previous studies, we have already successfully demonstrated that interferon type I receptor knockout mice (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) [47] can be readily used as animal models to study the immunogenicity and protective capacity of MVA immunization [62, 63] . Here, we wished to specifically assess the ability of MVA-delivered NiV-G antigen to induce the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. In general, the envelope G protein is known as the well-conserved attachment glycoprotein for both HeV and NiV. In a previous study, a recombinant adeno-associated virus vaccine expressing a full-length NiV-G protein protected hamsters in an NiV infection model [38] . In another approach, a soluble version of HeV-G has been engineered and showed an even more advantageous efficacy when tested in different preclinical animal models [42, 43, 64] . Using HeVsG, a monoclonal antibody m102.4 was derived and has already been successfully tested as a therapeutic approach in humans. To further enhance Henipavirus G protein-induced immunogenicity, we also designed and tested a soluble version of the NiV-G protein (NiVsG) similar to the HeVsG antigen used for the generation of m102.4. To comparatively evaluate the immunogenicity of the NiVsG protein, we also generated an MVA expressing full-length G. The recombinant viruses MVA-NiV-G and MVA-NiVsG produced stable amounts of NiV-G antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells, indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene under transcriptional control of the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific early-late promoter PmH5 or the strong natural early promoter Pvgf. In the case of MVA-NiVsG, removal of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail resulted in the secretion of the NiV-G from MVA-infected cells and accumulation also in the supernatant of cell cultures, as demonstrated in Western blot analysis and immunostaining. A similar result was obtained with HeVsG, as expressed by conventional recombinant VACV [41] . In contrast, the full-length MVA-produced NiV-G protein was not released in the supernatant, indicating the stable presentation on the cell surface through the transmembrane domains. Another important aspect of proper protein expression, folding and conformational stability is influenced by the N-glycans. Recent studies indicated that NiV-G N-glycans reduce fusion efficiency because removal of some N-glycans caused cell-cell hyperfusogenicity and increased viral entry [65] . Glycosidase treatment of full-length MVA-produced NiV-G resulted in a polypeptide of 58 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass predicted from the NiV G gene encoding sequences. The glycosidase treatment of the NiVsG also indicated the presence of all the N-glycans sites within the soluble version of the glycoprotein. A first in vivo evaluation in mice revealed that treatment with the MVA-NiV-G and MVA-NiVsG candidate vaccines resulted in the induction of similar levels of G-binding serum antibodies, confirming the immunogenicity of both antigen versions [66] . In that context, the presence of binding antibodies seems to play a substantial role in the blocking of NiV entry, since the mechanism of NiV neutralization is complex and involves more antigenic sites than those required for simple receptor binding [67] . However, more recent studies in different animal models suggest that cellular immune responses are also involved in mediating protection against NiV infection [38, 68] . This observation is further supported by studies in a pig model for NiV infection showing substantial activation of CD8 T cells after oral infection with NiV [45] . In line with these preclinical data, humans surviving NiV infection [2] showed significant levels of proliferating (Ki-67+) CD8 T cells, indicating the presence of acute effector cells. These data emphasize that in addition to the humoral immune responses, T cells could be associated with recovery from NiV infection. In a more recent study, Stroh and coworkers confirmed the activation of NiV-specific CD8 T cells in mice after vaccination with NiV-like particles. These data further highlight that T cells may play a critical role in NiV infection [68] . Another hypothesis is that NiV-specific T cells could be involved in potential immunopathologies. In this context, data from infections with other neurotropic viruses, for example, West Nile virus, demonstrated that antigen-specific T cells can open the blood brain barrier and contribute to virus infections of the brain [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Thus, to allow for more detailed studies characterizing T cells in NiV-associated immunity or pathogenesis, it is essential to identify NiV-G peptide epitopes allowing for the specific MHC-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of NiV-specific T cells. We identified a nonamer epitope NiV-G-9.3 [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] (RSTDNQAVI). Analysis of this peptide sequence showed that NiV-G 9.3 75-83 could be functionally conserved in Hendra virus, but not Cedar virus (another recognized Henipavirus), G antigens ( Figure S3 ). Structural and functional analyses reveal promiscuous and species-specific use of ephrin receptors by Cedar virus [74] . This potential epitope will support a more detailed experimental characterization of T cells induced by NiV infection in the mouse model and their contribution for pathogenesis and protection. In this study, we found that MVA-NiVsG vaccination induced significantly higher amounts of NiV-G epitope-specific CD8 T cells compared with the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccine. This was a somewhat surprising observation as the immunizations with both antigens had elicited very comparable levels of G-specific antibodies. It is tempting to speculate that NiVsG, as a soluble antigen, can trigger enhanced T cell responses because it is available to two different pathways of antigen presentation. On the one hand, NiVsG as intracellularly synthetized antigen is endogenously processed and presented via MHC-I on the cell surface to activate CD8 T cells. In addition, the NiVsG is secreted in high amounts from the MVA-NiVsG-infected cells, and such extracellular antigen can efficiently fuel the cross-presentation pathway and thereby induce elevated CD8 and CD4 T cell immune responses [75, 76] . Interestingly, the MVA-NiVsG candidate vaccine also proved to rapidly induce NiV-G epitope-specific CD8 T cells after single-dose application. These data are of relevance, since the epidemiology of the more recent NiV outbreaks demonstrated that a potential vaccine candidate should rapidly protect. Importantly, an H2b-restricted epitope has been identified in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, which serve as an established small animal model for NiV infection [15] . In addition, we showed the induction of NiV-G-specific CD4 T cells upon prime-boost immunization in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 with the MVA-NiV vaccines and using peptides for in vitro stimulation, as identified by using MHC II binding predictions obtained from the IEDB online resource (www.iedb.org). This data goes well along with the hypothesis that CD4 T cell responses are also significantly elevated upon infection [77] . Again, MVA-NiVsG vaccination results in more efficient activation of CD4 T cell responses. Further experiments will be needed to characterize the contribution of NiV G-specific CD4 T cells for NiV infection in more detail. Taken together, our findings showed the activation of NiV-G-specific T cells in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice following vaccination with MVA-based candidate vaccines. We confirmed the identification of potential H2-b-restricted NiV-G CD8 and CD4 T cell peptide epitopes. In this study we also demonstrated that an MVA-NiVsG candidate vaccine may have superior immunogenicity, resulting in NiV-specific antibodies and T cells in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data emphasize the promise of future studies in this animal model further evaluating the role of NiV-specific T cells activated by the G-9.3 [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] and G-50 269-283 peptide epitopes, in both vaccine-induced protection and potential contribution to NiV-induced pathologies.",

To monitor the release of recombinant NiV-G protein from MVA-NiVsG infected cells, we also analyzed the supernatants of infected CEF and HeLa cell cultures. A protein with a molecular mass of approximately 72-75 kDa sized band was observed in supernatants from MVA-NiVsG-infected cells (Figure 1C), indicating that infected cells were secreting the soluble NiV-G protein. Secreted NiV-G protein was first observed at 16 h post-infection in the supernatants of MVA-NiVsG-infected cultures and became especially prominent by 24 h post-infection. The levels of secreted NiV-G seemed to decline by 72 h post-infection. We did not however detect NiV-G protein in supernatants of MVA-NiV-G-infected cells.
