To address the deficiencies in our understanding of the molecular events characterizing acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook a transcriptional profiling study of the nasal mucosa over the course of acute respiratory illness amongst individuals with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and no underlying respiratory disease. Methods: Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 4X44K array platform. Time point-based microarray and principal component analyses were conducted to identify and distinguish acute respiratory illness-associated transcriptional profiles over the course of our study. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify biological processes over-represented within each acute respiratory illness-associated profile, and gene expression was subsequently confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.",

            "text": "Proposed stages of acute respiratory illness. Derived from the analysis of three time point transitions of ARI, our model proposes that ARI can be divided into three stages reflecting the peak, reduction and resolution of symptoms. By encompassing clinically distinct groups, we additionally propose that the presence of underlying respiratory disease, particularly asthma exacerbation, can influence either the magnitude of gene expression or the transcriptional profiles that characterize the distinct biological processes at each respective stage of ARI. ARI, acute respiratory illness; BL, baseline; D2, day 2; D, day 6. [21, 40, 41] is present within the airway epithelium of asthmatics during exacerbation.",

While further characterization of TMEM178 is required, we consider TMEM178 and the other exacerbation genes identified within our study to represent a genuine exacerbation signature and potential targets for exacerbationspecific therapies.",

Our study indicates that people with asthma who experienced ARI-induced exacerbation are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair mechanisms and, most strikingly, a distinct set of genes constituting an exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature. Although the absence of corresponding cellular composition data of the nasal mucosa (for example, via flow cytometry) and the focus exclusively on the upper airways may have been limitations of our study, these findings represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions that characterize ARI-induced asthma exacerbations.",
