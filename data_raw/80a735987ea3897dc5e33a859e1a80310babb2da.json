The infected GALT consequently serves as the major reservoir for HIV-1 infection and could constantly shed HIV-1 and CD4 + T cells into the intestinal lumen. To examine this hypothesis, we monitored HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in fecal samples of chronically infected subjects with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared this to levels of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in urine and blood from the same subjects. Our results show that HIV-1 DNA, RNA and CD4 mRNA were detected in 8%, 19% and 31% respectively, of feces samples from infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load, and were not detected in any of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. In urine samples, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24% of infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load and 23% of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 revealed distinct virus populations in concurrently collected serum, feces and urine samples from one subject. In addition, our study demonstrated for the first time the presence of CD4 mRNA in fecal specimens of HIV-1 infected subjects, which could be used to assess GALT pathogenesis in HIV-1 infection.",

Contrast to the blood and other organized lymphoid tissues, which contain abundance of naive resting T cells, a majority of the CD4 + T cells that reside in GALT are CCR5 positive, activated memory CD4 T cells which are the preferred target cells for HIV/SIV infection [1] [2] [3] . HIV infects GALT at a very early stage of infection regardless of the route of infection and active HIV/SIV replication in GALT is present throughout the entire course of infection, which leads to GALT acting as a major viral reservoir and results in mucosal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation that contributes to generalized systemic immune activation and disease progression [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

We hypothesize that during HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 free virus and infected/uninfected CD4 + T cells constantly shed from GALT into the intestinal lumen and are discharged with feces. Therefore, the amount of HIV-1 and CD4 + T cells contained in the feces could reveal the degree of pathogenesis in GALT. Detection of HIV-1 has been reported in fecal specimens from drug na\u00efve HIV-1 infected individuals in the acute phase of infection [8] [9] [10] . There is no information on HIV-1 detection in the feces of chronically infected subjects, especially in subjects undergoing antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). Monitoring the dynamic change of CD4 + T cells in GALT of infected individuals is very important to evaluate disease progression. However, due to the anatomic location of GALT, invasive and expensive biopsy is the only current method to monitor CD4 + T cell loss in GALT. In contrast, feces could be an easily accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive specimen to assess CD4 + T cell depletion of GALT, since CD4 + T cells could shed into the intestinal lumen and be discharged in feces.",

            "text": "The gastrointestinal tract is the major reservoir of viral infected cells and the site of rapid and profound loss of CD4 T cells, which could be the result from HIV direct killing of CD4-expressing primarily infected cells, HIV indirect killing of bystander cells through HIV proteins and/or by the proinflammatory state that is associated to ongoing viral replication [22] . One subset of CD4+ T cells in GALT is Th17 cells characterized by the production of IL-17, which are involved in epithelial regeneration and membrane barrier function. HIV/SIV-mediated Th17 depletion from GALT [23] impairs the gastrointestinal barrier and leads to translocation of intestinal microbes or microbial products, which then contribute to immune activation and disease progression [24, 25] . We hypothesize that during CD4 T cell depletion, the depleted cells could shed into intestinal lumen through the impaired GI barrier and be discharged in feces. Because of the persistent active viral replication in GALT, CD4 positive cells are constantly lost from the GI tract throughout infection. Since cells and cellular proteins are degraded very quickly in the lumen of gastrointestinal tract, CD4 mRNA in feces has been monitored instead as a surrogate marker to evaluate CD4 T cells contained in the feces. However, it is possible that some of the detected CD4 mRNA were from macrophages and dendritic cells since these cells express CD4 as well.",

HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA detected in the fecal specimens of HIV-1 infected subjects could be the result either from internal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or from shedding of HIV-1 infected cells and free virus from GALT. To dissect these two possibilities, fecal occult blood test was performed in all samples. As listed in Table 3 , a total of 7 fecal samples were positive in the test: 2 from Group A, 1 from Group B, 3 from Group C and 1 from Group D. All fecal samples positive for HIV-1 RNA/DNA were negative in the occult blood test.

However, the presence of HIV-1 in urine from chronic infected subjects with or without ART has not been addressed. Our data show that HIV-1 DNA and RNA were detected in both the urine pellet and the supernatant from the HIV-1 infected subjects (Table 3) . HIV-1 DNA was detected in 7 urine pellet samples from the 29 HIV-1 infected subjects, 4 of the 7 samples from subjects (2 subjects were not on ART and 2 subjects on ART) with detectable plasma viral load, and 3 from subjects (who were on ART) and with undetectable viral load.

In addition, HIV-1 compartmentalization was revealed in gut, renal system and blood in one infected subject. The presence of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in fecal and urine samples from HIV-1 infected subjects is lesser in the chronic stage of infection compared to the acute stage of infection. Our results suggest that feces could be an informative specimen in clinic for detecting HIV and CD4 mRNA. Since a small sample size was used in the current study, future longitudinal studies are needed to show whether there is a correlation of detection of HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in feces with disease progression.",

However, such studies are very difficult and expensive to implement. We hypothesized that during the massive HIV-1 replication and CD4 + T cell depletion in GALT, HIV-1 and CD4 + T cells shed into the intestinal lumen and the amount of HIV-1 and CD4 + T cells in the feces would associate with the pathogenic changes in GALT.Since the components of human feces are very complex and so far no sensitive methods are available for detection of viral and human RNA/DNA in human feces, we have initially tested assay sensitivity for nucleic acid isolation and detection of HIV-1 DNA/RNA in feces. Our results showed that HIV-1 DNA was detected from normal donor feces mixed with 8E5 cells with the detection limit of 2.5 copies of HIV-1 DNA/reaction. HIV-1 RNA was detected from normal feces mixed with HIV-1 positive plasma with detection limit of 40 copies of HIV-1 RNA/reaction. To evaluate usage of fecal specimens to monitor HIV-1 associated GALT pathogenesis, we collected the feces samples from HIV-1 uninfected and infected donors with or without ART.In the 49 fecal samples collected in 2007 and 2008, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 1 subject from Group B (HIV-1 infected but not on ART) with detectable viral load of 35,471 copies/ml in plasma. HIV-1 RNA was detected in 4 subjects from Group B with viral load ranging between 14,690 and 55,396 copies/ml in plasma and in one subject from Group D (HIV-1 infected on ART) with detectable viral load of 16,862 copies/ml in plasma. Specificity of the HIV-1 detection was confirmed by amplifying HIV-1 gag region in these env positive samples. In the selected 5 feces samples, identical results were observed in 4 samples",
