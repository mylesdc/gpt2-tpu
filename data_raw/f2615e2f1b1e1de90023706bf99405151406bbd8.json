Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1-3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (,3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%).

Comparison of the viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness following respiratory infection. It also provides data relevant to the development of prevention strategies. The following viruses (in no particular order) have been detected during acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [1, 2] : influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), picornavirus (PIC, including rhinovirus and enterovirus), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus (HCoV). Respiratory virus infections are diagnosed in four principal ways: virus culture, serology, immunofluorescence/antigen detection, and nucleic acid/PCR-based tests. Nucleic acid tests are significantly more sensitive than the other methods described, which may have an impact on the viruses detected [1, 2] . Nucleic acid tests are now being multiplexed, allowing rapid simultaneous detection of many viruses [1, 2] .",

This study provides useful information on the prevalence, clinical profiles, and epidemiology of specific viral aetiology in adults with ARTI attending an ED in China, and will contribute to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ARTI in adults. We collected nasal and throat swab samples from adult patients attending an ED in Beijing, and analysed them using both multiple nested RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR methods to detect 13 human RVs: FluA, B, RSV, PIVs 1-3, PIC, ADV, HCoVs (-229E, -OC43, -NL63, -HKU1), and hMPV. Of the 416 samples, 220 (52.88%) contained at least one virus, which is consistent with other studies performed worldwide (34.6-62.6%) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but a little higher than a previous report from Beijing [4] . This may be due to differences in detection methods, population, and/or the time the study was performed. This also reminds us that in the year after influenza pandemics, the frequency distribution of these 13 respiratory viruses in adult patients in the Beijing area may increase, pending further studies. In addition, of the 416 samples, no viruses were detected in 196 (47.11%). This suggests the existence of other pathogens, such as human parvovirus [15] and human polyomavirus [16, 17] , or unknown others. Thus, further optimization of specimen collection (location, period) and detection methods may improve the detection rate.",

PICs, including rhinovirus and enterovirus, are frequently detected in patients with upper respiratory tract infections [18, 19] . A previous study showed that 50% of common cold infections are caused by rhinovirus [18] . PIC had the highest detection rate (17.79%, 74/416), and covered all age groups. Peaks occurred in August and September, 2010, as in previous reports [18] . This PIC detection rate is higher than that reported elsewhere [4] , likely due to the fact that the previous study focused only on rhinovirus and enterovirus, neglecting the other PICs that may cause respiratory infection. In addition, different sample collection periods and detection methods may have contributed to the discrepancies in detection rates [10] .",

Several factors may account for this disparity: we detected mainly PIV1-3, but PIV4 was in reality the most common virus; or the PIV-4 infection rate increased in recent outbreaks of ARTIs [26] . In addition, PIV causes mainly LRTIs, but samples in this study were mainly collected from patients with URTIs.

Twenty-two PICpositive patients were co-infected with FluA, ADV, 229E, PIV, HKU1, or FluB. Rhinovirus is a major etiological agent of URTIs, and is implicated in 25-70% of co-infections in hospitalized patients [18] . Therefore, further identification and typing of PIC is [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] 18] , patients infected with the four most frequently detected viruses (FluA, ADV, PIC, HCoVs) presented with obvious symptoms of respiratory infection, including headache, sore throat, cough, runny nose, chills, and coryza. Except for chills and diarrhoea (P.0.05), the clinical characteristics of ARTIs caused by these four viruses differed slightly. Headache was associated with PIC, ADV, and HCoV infection. Cough was significantly more common in influenza patients; and sore throat, cough, rhinorrhoea, nasal symptoms were more common in those infected with PIC, which were in line with previous reports [2, 6, 18] . Molecular assays are useful for diagnosis of RTIs, because it is often difficult even for the experienced clinician to pinpoint the aetiological agent based only on clinical information. Thus, etiological research may facilitate physicians' appropriate antibiotic use, and will provide useful information for surveillance and control of ARTIs [27] .",

Our study is original and unique in several aspects. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first use of sensitive, real-time RT-PCR assays targeting all four HCoVs and hMPV in adults with ARTIs in China. Compared to the reports of Ren et al. [4, 5] regarding adult ARTIs which specimens collected from the same hospital (Table 4 ), the detection rates of several aetiological agents (hMPV, total HCoVs, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1) in this study were significantly higher (P,0.05,the data were compared between groups of specimens for virus detected using a Student's t-test), although the reasons for this require further investigation. The second unique aspect of this study is the identification of four leading viral agents (PIC, FluA, ADV, and HCoVs) and associated clinical profiles in adults with ARTIs admitted to the ED. The pattern differed from those in previous reports from the same area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the potential impact of four viruses (PIC, FluA, ADV, and HCoVs) as causes of ARTIs in adults admitted to an ED in China. The main limitation of the study is that we did not evaluate other recently identified viruses (such as bocavirus, WU, and KI virus) or atypical aetiologies. An additional limitation is that the subjects were recruited only in one continuous year. It is possible that these limitations might have affected the results and should be taken into consideration.",
