            "text": "Stochastic transmission dynamic models are especially useful for studying the early emergence of novel pathogens given the importance of chance events when the number of infectious individuals is small. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, R 0 , and R eff ) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.",

Early and accurate prediction of epidemic behavior is needed to inform effective public health policy decisions which much balance the risk of major PLOS Computational Biology | outbreaks with the substantial costs of interventions. Key parameters governing the behavior of epidemics, however, cannot be directly observed and hence computational techniques are required for parameter estimation and prediction on the basis of imperfect surveillance data. In this paper, we develop a method (Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems, MSS) that utilizes accumulating epidemic data to estimate in real-time (1) key epidemic parameters including the average number of secondary cases and the mean duration of infectiousness, (2) the future number of cases, and (3) the unobserved number of infected individuals in the population. Employing comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that MSS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art calibration and prediction techniques in the majority of simulated scenarios. MSS may thus allow policy makers to respond more effectively and use resources more efficiently in the face of emerging epidemic threats.

For example, infection network models are commonly used when symptom onset date for each reported case is available [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In these models, disease spread is described as a directed network in which the nodes represent cases and the directed edges between nodes represent transmission links. In the absence of the type of detailed individual-level data required by infection network methods, compartmental transmission dynamic models have been used for parameter estimation and for projecting epidemic trajectory. These models divide the population into disjoint subgroups (e.g. susceptible, infectious, and recovered) and transitions between the epidemic states are described using ordinary differential equations (for deterministic models) [18] or Markov chains (for stochastic models) [19] .",

Therefore, the likelihood function (1) is often approximated by assuming that the epidemic observations in each period follow a discrete probability distribution (e.g. Poisson distribution) and are independently distributed across observation periods [23, 33] . For example, to approximate the likelihood function (1), Riley and colleagues assume that epidemic observations follow independent Poisson distributions where means are chosen to match the means generated from 250 model replications [23] . The method we develop here to approximate the likelihood function (1) does not retain the unrealistic assumption that these observations are independent.",

By the definition of epidemic states, the transition from state \u03bd i\u22121 to \u03bd i generates a unique set of observations, and it is trivial to find whether the state transitionn i\u00c0 1 to \u03bd i can generate the observation y i (see design of performance analysis for an illustrative example). Therefore, for a given observation y i , the probability P\u00f0 y i jn i ;n i\u00c0 1 ; y\u00de in Eq (4) is equal to 1 if the transition from staten i\u00c0 1 to \u03bd i results in observing y i , and is zero otherwise.

In the next subsections, we propose an algorithm to achieve this. Approximating state transition probabilities. Finding the exact state transition probability function p(\u00c1) can be difficult, and in many cases impossible, as state spaces in epidemic models can be quite large or unbounded. To overcome this problem, we employ a linear noise approximation (LNA) method to approximate the probability distribution of the new epidemic state \u03bd i given the previous state \u03bd i\u22121 , i.e. p(\u03bd i |\u03bd i\u22121 ; \u03b8).

The first benchmark method, which is based on an assumption of independent Poisson observations, is straightforward to understand and to implement and has been used to infer basic fundamental parameters during the early appearance of novel pathogens [23] . For the second and third approaches, we consider Particle Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter [27] as these methods won the 2014 \"Predict the Influenza Season Challenge\" sponsored by the U. S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention [41] and also demonstrate competitive performance against four other methods in a recent comparison study [27] . Benchmark method A: Likelihood approximation with the assumption of independent Poisson observations (I.Poi). We use the method from Riley and colleagues [23] as the first benchmark. This method assumes that the observations y i are independent and factorizes the likelihood function L(Y i ; \u03b8) (Eq (1)) to where P \u00f0I:Poi\u00de \u00f0\u00c1jy\u00de $ Poisson\u00f0m i \u00de. To calculate the mean \u03bc i , we obtain 1000 stochastic trajectories using parameter values \u03b8 and shift them so that the first observation for each trajectory lies within the first observation period [t 0 , t 1 ]. We then calculate the mean of observations over period [t i\u22121 , t i ] (i.e. \u03bc i ) using these simulated trajectories. This approach ignores the interdependencies between observations y 1 , y 2 , . . ., y i and approximates P\u00f0 y i jy 1 ; . . . ; y i\u00c0 1 ; y\u00de by P \u00f0I:Poi\u00de \u00f0 y i ; y\u00de.

This suggests that the state updating procedure utilized by MSS method is more effective than the state updating methods employed by PF and EnKF. It is worth noting that the high IRE for infection prevalence at the beginning and the end of epidemics is the result of the small number of infectious individuals during these phases. While this impacts the performance of all methods (including MSS), the effect is small for MSS as the state updating procedure leads to more reliable state estimates. Also, since the estimation of the effective R requires an estimate of the current number of susceptibles, the MSS method again shows a superior behavior. Fig 5A-5C shows the results of testing the hypothesis that the MSS method outperforms all benchmark methods at 0.05 significance level at different epidemic times. This figure suggests that, in the majority of cases, the MSS method demonstrates either statistically superior or similar performance to the benchmark methods (represented by Green, Blue and Black colors). We note that even for the small number of situations in which MSS is statistically dominated by another benchmark method, the absolute difference in mIRE (as shown in Fig 4B-4E and S1B-S1E to S8B-S8E Figs is small.",

In this sensitivity analysis, the MSS method demonstrated the ability to cope with noisy data and sustain its performance (S9 Fig) . We next considered a scenario for which the epidemic trajectories are provided by an SEITR model (see S1 Text subsection 2 \"Equations of the SEITR model\") but an SITR model is chosen for parameter estimation and prediction. This allowed us to test to what extent model misspecification could erode the performance of these approaches, which is important because the true epidemic process may not be known. This sensitivity analysis revealed that each of the calibration methods considered here maintained their performance under this particular model misspecification scenario with respect to most performance criteria, but had problems with estimates for R eff (S10 and S11 Figs). Each method failed to accurately estimate R eff after the peak, which may be explained by the fact that in extreme epidemic scenarios used in this experiment, only a few number of individuals remain in the Susceptible compartment. Since the misspecified model used for calibration does not include the additional Exposed compartment, the size of Susceptible compartment is overestimated by all calibration methods, which leads to inaccurate R eff estimates after the peak.",

The main difference between EnKF and MSS is that EnKF does not use an approximation for the likelihood for an observation but rather updates states and parameters based on correlation between compartments and data using multiple parameter vectors. The MSS state updating procedure allows the calculation of these correlations using a single parameter vector.

The observation variance we selected for our analyses is adapted from [27] , which is a heuristic choice but has proved reliable in previous studies [26] . We ran a sensitivity analysis on this parameter by dropping the absolute variance term from 10,000 to 1, and observed no major change in the performance of PF and EnKF methods in populations of various size. This suggests that the absolute term in the observational variance is not the determining factor in the relative performance of EnKF, PF and MSS.",

First, while including the necessary complexity to offer a suitable platform for our analyses, the epidemic model used to evaluate the comparative performance of calibration methods is highly simplified. Investigating the impact of model complexity level on the performance of calibration methods would be of immediate interest for future research. Second, our evaluation are based on \"simulated\" epidemic trajectories. While only simulated scenarios can allow us to calculate the relative errors in estimating the unknown parameters (e.g. R 0 , mean duration of infectiousness), further investigation using real-world data is required to comprehensively evaluate the performance of MSS along with other existing calibration methods.",

Our model, however, does not account for the fact that in reality only a portion of influenza cases will be reported as not all infected individuals will have severe enough symptoms to seek care. If the fraction of cases that remains undetected is known and fixed, this is easily handled in the model with the addition of compartments and parameters to reflect the observation process, However, the degree of underreporting is often unknown and may change over the course of an epidemic. Such underreporting impacts the performance of all available calibration methods, and the development of novel approaches that can better account for this phenomenon is an important direction for future research.",
