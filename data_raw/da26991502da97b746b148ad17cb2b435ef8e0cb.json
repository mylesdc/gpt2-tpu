A new contemporary strain of HPeV1, KVP6 (accession no. KC769584), was isolated from a clinical specimen. Full-genome alignment revealed that HPeV1 KVP6 shares high genome homology with the German strain of HPeV1, 7555312 (accession no. FM178558) and could be classified in the clade 1B group. An intertypic recombination was shown within the P2-P3 genome regions of HPeV1. Celltype tropism test showed that T84 cells (colon carcinoma cells), A549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG cells (glioblastoma cells) were susceptible to HPeV1 infection, which might be relevant clinically. A facilitated cytopathic effect and increased viral titers were reached after serial viral passages in Vero cells, with viral genome mutation found in later passages. HPeV1 is sensitive to elevated temperature because 39\u00b0C incubation impaired virion production. HPeV1 induced innate immunity with phosphorylation of interferon (IFN) regulatory transcription factor 3 and production of type I IFN in A549 but not T84 cells. Furthermore, type I IFN inhibited HPeV1 production in A549 cells but not T84 cells; T84 cells may be less responsive to type I IFN stimulation. Moreover, HPeV1-infected cells showed downregulated type I IFN activation, which indicated a type I IFN evasion mechanism. The characterization of the complete genome and infection features of HPeV1 provide comprehensive information about this newly isolated HPeV1 for further diagnosis, prevention or treatment strategies.",

            "text": "Human parechovirus (HPeV), a small, round-structured, non-enveloped virus with a singlestranded and positive-sense RNA genome, belongs to the Picornaviridae [1] . HPeV is structurally similar to other picornaviruses because of its icosahedral symmetry and appearance on electron microscopy [2] . It was first described in 1961 as echoviruses 22 and 23 of the genus Enterovirus on the basis of serology and clinical presentation on identification from an outbreak of diarrhea among children [3] . However, further studies showed that properties of the virus, such as nucleotide sequence in replication and translation elements, differ from other members of the genus Enterovirus. So the virus was re-classified into a new genus, Parechovirus, and the echoviruses 22 and 23 were re-named HPeV1 and HPeV2, respectively [4, 5, 6] . During the past decade, several other HPeV isolates have been reported; to date, we have the full genome sequences for eight HPeV types, HPeV1 to HPeV8, and eight other types, HPeV9 to HPeV16, are known based on their viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences (http://www. picornastudygroup.com). For replication and virus particle formation of HPeV, the open reading frame (ORF), flanked by a 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and a 3' UTR, encodes a single polyprotein that is processed to three structural or capsid-encoding proteins (VP0, VP3 and VP1, encompassing P1) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C [P2]; 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D [P3]). Unlike other picornaviruses, HPeV VP0 nucleocapsid is not further cleaved to generate the capsid proteins VP4 and VP2 [7] . HPeV differs from members of the genus Enterovirus by not shutting off host cell protein synthesis during replication; its 2A protein does not likely possess protease activity to prevent normal cellular cap-dependent translation [7, 8, 9, 10] .",

A large enterovirus surveillance in the United States from 1983 to 2003 revealed 73% HPeV1 infection and 68% HPeV2 infection in children < 1 year old [17] . Indeed, we have only a few reports of HPeV infection in patients > 10 years old [18, 19, 20] . The most common genotype of HPeV in Europe is HPeV1, followed by HPeV3 [15, 21, 22] . In Japan, HPeVs were isolated from 0.3% of 13,656 clinical samples collected from 1991 to 2005; the isolated HPeV types were HPeV3 (39%), HPeV1 (34.2%), HPeV6 (24.4%) and HPeV4 (2.4%) [18] . HPeV1 may be the most prevalent type worldwide. Serological ELISA revealed the seroprevalence for HPeVs from 22% to 88% in children between 2 and 24 months old, 70% in children 5 years old and 95% in adults [23] . Most infections of HPeVs are asymptomatic or clinically mild in severity in children > 5 years old and adults, and it is probably due to the age-dependent established antiviral immunity against widespread circulation and infection of HPeVs [23, 24, 25] .",

Nosocomial infection or outbreaks in neonate hospital departments seem to play a substantial role in both kinds of HPeV infection [26, 27] . More severe consequences of HPeV infection, such as acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and Reye syndrome, have been reported [13, 18] ; HPeV3 infection results in severe diseases of the CNS and neonatal sepsis [28] . HPeV3 infection is almost exclusively restricted to infants < 3 months old [29] , which may be explained by observations of much lower seroprevalence of HPeV3 among women of childbearing age as compared with almost universal seropositivity for HPeV1 [28, 30] ; therefore, neonates are at increased risk of HPeV3 infection because of reduced maternal antibody protection [31] . HPeV3 differs from HPeV1 by lacking the RGD motif in VP1, so an alternative receptor may exist, thus changing the cellular tropism of HPeV3 and leading to enhanced ability to spread and replicate in the CNS [32, 33] .",

We performed a Sim-Plot analysis on these known HPeV full-length nucleotide sequences against HPeV1 KVP6 to identify a possible recombination event between different HPeV prototypes. The SimPlot analysis revealed the highest similarity of HPeV1 KVP6 with HPeV1 strain 7555312 in the highly variable capsid-encoding regions VP0, VP3 and VP1, so HPeV1 KVP6 grouped with HPeV1 [35, 36] (Fig. 1A) ; however, in the more conserved regions, such as 2C and 3D, HPeV1 KVP6 had higher similarity with HPeV7 PAK5045. Such findings may have resulted from a recombination event during HPeV evolution [35] . In addition, full genome alignment showed that HPeV1 KVP6 shared the highest nucleotide sequence homology, 87%, with the HPeV1 strain 7555312 and a mean of 77% identity with other HPeV isolates (S4 Table) . At the polyprotein level, all isolates possessed a mean of 88% amino acid identity; however, HPeV1 KVP6 shared 97% amino acid homology with HPeV1 strain 7555312 ( Fig. 1B and S5 Table) . Phylogenetic analysis of structural regions, in particular of VP1 protein because of its decisive role in molecular typing of HPeV [34] , showed the HPeV1 KVP6 VP1 sequence close to that of HPeV1 strain 7555312 (Fig. 1C) , and HPeV1 KVP6 can be typed to HPeV1 clade 1B [35] . In fact, similar findings were noted in the phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural regions (data not shown).",

In addition, T84 cells (intestinal carcinoma), A549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG (glioblastoma cells) were susceptible to HPeV infection; BHK21 cells (baby hamster kindney epithelial cells), HeLa cells (human cervival cancer cells) and J774A.1 cells (mouse macrophages) were not infected with HPeV1 (Fig. 2) . Because HPeV1 infection causes clinical symptoms including respiratory-and gastrointestinal-tract and CNS symptoms [25] , the cell tropism results might reflect in part an association of HPeV1 infection and its target organs.

We found no CPE at post-infection day 10 in P5 infected cells, which might due to the extremely low virion production. Nevertheless, P6 progeny showed CPE and plaque formation; CPE was accelerated from day 9 to 3 in the later progenies, and viral titer was increased at P9 and P10 (Fig. 3A, left panels) . Genome mutation during virus passage was reported in hepatitis A and E virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) infection [38, 39, 40] . We analyzed the VP1 sequence from different progenies, because in P9 of HPeV1 KVP6, the nucleotide position 2984 adenosine was replaced by thymine and resulted in a mutation in amino acid position 768 from Asparagine to Isoleucine (Fig. 3A, right panel) . Because the amino acid position 768 is close to the RGD motif (position 763~765), whether this mutation relates to receptor binding might be of interest. Mutations other than the 2984 positive one may exist in other regions of the genome. These data suggest that HPeV1 KVP6 virulence and viral titer could be amplified by serial passage in vitro; however, the genome instability would appear during the passages.",

In A549 cells, the HPeV1 accumulated over time and reached > 10 5 PFU/ml at 72 or 96 hpi, approximately 10-fold higher than at 6 hpi, (Fig. 3F, upper panel) , with approximately 100-fold increase in T84 cells (Fig. 3F, lower panel) . Thus, T84 cells might be more susceptible to HPeV1 producing a higher level of virions than A549 cells. These viral titer findings also suggested that the virion production kinetics was not associated with the dynamic mRNA and protein expression in infected cells. However, why the second round of viral gene or protein expression did not proceed in T84 cells during 72 to 96 hpi and why the relatively low mRNA level in T84 cells is unclear. Whether these phenomena are cell type-dependent requires further investigation.",

HPeV1 infection with 6-h short-term incubation at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C retained the infectivity of the positive control; nevertheless, 39\u00b0C-treated virus could not efficiently infect A549 and T84 cells (S1A and B Figs.) , which suggested the HPeV1 is unstable at 39\u00b0C.

            "text": "Host innate immune response is critical against virus; therefore, we examined whether temperature affected viral infection-mediated innate immune activation. Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) plays a key role in virus triggering innate immunity activation; it coordinates with NF\u03baB p65 subunit and c-Jun/AP1 to bind the type I IFN promoter region to induce type I IFN transcription [41, 42, 43] . Thus, we monitored IRF3 phosphorylation to understand the HPeV1-mediated innate immune response under different incubation temperatures. HPeV1 induced high-level and long-term IRF3 phosphorylation in A549 cells at 37\u00b0C but not 39\u00b0C culture (Fig. 4C, upper panels) ; virus production failed at 39\u00b0C (Fig. 4B) . The findings of 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C incubation might reflect a typical viral load-dependent response of IRF3 activation under normal physical temperature. Additionally, 33\u00b0C is lower than 37\u00b0C, and A549 cells showed defective IRF3 activation, even though HPeV1 was produced at 33\u00b0C incubation (Fig. 4B) , which suggested the low host response to virus infection at 33\u00b0C. In fact, polyI:C-induced IRF3 phosphorylation level was lower in 33\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C in A549 and T84 cells (S2 Fig.) . Virus-mediated IRF3 activation was ambiguous at all three culture temperatures in T84 cells (Fig. 4C, lower panels) ; more HPeV1 virions were produced in T84 than A549 cells at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4B) . We also detected IRF3 activation in another HPeV1-susceptible cell line, DBTRG-5MG glioblastoma cells, which showed a similar IRF3 activation pattern as for HPeV1-infected A549 cells (Fig. 4D) .",

The infection rate of HPeV1 was estimated. IFN\u03b1-2a and IFN\u03b2 pretreatment reduced HPeV1 infection, but this effect was not shown with IFN post-treatment in A549 cells (Fig. 5A) . Surprisingly, T84 cells showed no anti-HPeV1 activity of type I IFN with pretreatment or post-treatment with IFN (Fig. 5B) . Viral titration assay also revealed the effect of type I IFN against HPeV1 in A549 but not T84 cells (Fig. 5C and D) . Therefore, we measured the level of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. As compared with T84 cells, A549 cells showed that IFN\u03b1-2a and IFN\u03b2 induced higher levels of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (Fig. 5E and F) . These data would explain in part that pretreatment with type I IFN inhibited HPeV1 infection in A549 but not T84 cells and suggested that the efficiency of type I IFN against HPeV1 was cell type-dependent.

Type I IFN-activated STAT1 phosphorylation was reduced in HPeV1-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6A, left panel) , with a slight difference in T84 cells (Fig. 6B, right panel) , which might due to the low response to type I IFN of T84 cells.

Consistently, IFN\u03b2 induced the mRNA expression of antiviral-associated proteins such as Viperin, IRF7, PKR, MxA and MAVS, which was significantly inhibited by HPeV1 in A549 and T84 cells (Fig. 6C) . These results suggested that HPeV1 infection interfered in type I IFN signaling activation.

We established a propagation and infection model of a clinically isolated domestic HPeV1 virus, a newly isolated Taiwanese strain HPeV1 KVP6, which allowed us to characterize the genome and infection features of the virus. We found genome intertypic recombination between HPeV1 KVP6 and HPeV7 in the nonstructural coding region, which might be associated with HPeV evolution and pathogenesis. In vitro study showed impaired HPeV1 replication at 39\u00b0C culture, so physically high temperature restricts HPeV1 replication. The HPeV1 infection induced an inconsistent level of innate immune responses in different cell types. We found viral-induced IRF3 activation and increased level of type I IFN production in A549 lung carcinoma cells but not T84 colon carcinoma cells; in particular, type I IFN treatment failed to inhibit HPeV1 infection in T84 cells. Our findings may explain why patients with HPeV1 infection frequently show gastrointestinitis symptoms. Furthermore, in both A549 and T84 cells, HPeV1 downregulated the activation of STAT1, downstream of IFN, and antiviral gene expression; this innate immune evasion should be critical for HPeV1 infection. SimPlot analysis showed that KVP6 had high similarity with HPeV1 strain 7555312 and SH1 but not HPeV1 prototype Harris strain. However, after the VP1 region, the similarity between KVP6 and 7555312 strains decreased, with more similarity with HPeV7 PAK5045 in 2C and HPeV4 K251176-02 in 3D of the nonstructural regions, which suggested intertypic recombination events [35, 36] . The finding would support that the most frequent breaking points for recombination flanked the capsid-encoding region [35, 36, 47] . In addition, HPeV5 and HPeV6 showed recombination at the viral genome P2-P3 junction, within the 2C [48, 49] . The C-terminus of VP1 of most HPeVs contained the RGD receptor-binding domain, which is critical for cell entry [11] , and recombination at this position could thus have important evolutionary mechanisms in HPeVs [35, 36] . Previous reports indicated frequent recombination among HPeV1, -4, -5 and -6 but more restricted among HPeV3 strains [35] ; of interest, HPeV3 lacks an RGD motif in the VP1 C-terminus [12] .",

In addition, high incubation temperature such as 39\u00b0C, considered a febrile status in humans, might inhibit HPeV1 virion production. Similar findings were reported in enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, also members of the Picornaviridae family, in that replication was reduced with increased temperature [50] . In this study, we observed viral gene-expression shutdown with high temperature, which suggested that viral RNA replication was attenuated at high temperature. A possible mechanism of temperature-regulated viral gene replication was described in the infection of influenza A virus, a single-stranded and negative-sense genomic RNA virus. The viral polymerase is dissociated from the viral genome promoter at high temperature (41\u00b0C), which leads to failed genomic replication [51] . Moreover, we found that HPeV1 infectivity was retained at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C but impaired at 39\u00b0C incubation before cell inoculation, which suggests the instability of HPeV1 viral particle in elevated temperature.",

            "text": "Following virus infection, antiviral innate immune responses are initiated in host cells. The transcription of type I IFN, mainly IFN\u03b2, is rapidly induced via cooperative binding to its promoter by three families of transcription factors: NF-\u03baB, activator protein 1 (AP1) and IRF [52, 53] . The secreted IFN\u03b2 acts on neighboring cells and activates the STAT pathway via type I IFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression, which may result in amplification of type I IFN induction via such a positive feedback mechanism [54] . Among the members of IRFs, IRF3 is critically involved in the initial induction of IFN\u03b2 when cells are infected by viruses [54] . Although we found that in A549 cells, HPeV1 induced a sustained level of total IRF3 at both 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C, phosphorylated IRF3, the activated form of IRF3, only emerged and lasted until late infection at 37\u00b0C, not 39\u00b0C. From the results we just mentioned, high incubation temperature plasmids (400 ng) and control vector pRL-TK (40 ng) for 24 h, then infected with HPeV1 for 6 h. After 24 h of IFN\u03b2 (1000 U/ml) stimulation, ISRE luciferase activity was measured by dual-luciferase assay and (C) RT-qPCR of mRNA expression.

Moreover, the effect of type I IFN against HPeV1 was inconsistent between A549 and T84 cells in that type I IFN pretreatment inhibited HPeV1 infection in A549 but not T84 cells perhaps because of the lower sensitivity of type I IFN signaling in T84 cells.",
