            "text": "Coronaviruses represent current and emerging threats for many species, including humans. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for sporadic infections in mostly Middle Eastern countries, with occasional transfer elsewhere. A key step in the MERS-CoV replication cycle is the fusion of the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the virus spike protein, S. The location of the fusion peptide within the MERS S protein has not been precisely mapped. We used isolated peptides and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) to demonstrate membrane binding for a peptide located near the N-terminus of the S2 domain. Key residues required for activity were mapped by amino acid replacement and their relevance in vitro tested by their introduction into recombinant MERS S protein expressed in mammalian cells. Mutations preventing membrane binding in vitro also abolished S-mediated syncytium formation consistent with the identified peptide acting as the fusion peptide for the S protein of MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses, positive strand non-segmented RNA viruses with the largest RNA genomes known, infect a wide range of hosts, including many mammalian species, and cause a range of diseases, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurological diseases [1] . Viruses of zoonotic potential are found within the coronaviruses, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in Southern China in 2003 [2] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] . In both cases the infection of humans is thought to have arisen by contact with an intermediate host which in turn acquired the virus from the original reservoir, presumed to be bats [4, 5] . The basis of cross-species infection lies primarily in the ability of the virus major surface spike protein, S, to bind to cell surface receptors and initiate infection. Coronaviruses use a variety of receptors ranging from sugars to extended cell surface proteins (reviewed in [6] ) and the entry receptor for MERS infection has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), found on a variety of cell types including epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [7, 8] . More recently, sialic acid has been shown to be an additional low-affinity attachment receptor whose binding might precede that of DPP4, suggesting that its distribution may also contribute to virus tropism [9] .",

Separation of the S1 and S2 domains is mediated by host cell proteases including members of the cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [12] . The S2 protein comprises the fusion peptide, two conserved heptad repeats (HR) (distant in the primary amino acid sequence but adjacent in the post-fusion conformation), a transmembrane domain and a short intracellular tail [11] . The structural features of S, including the fusion peptide, are essential for spike function and have been suggested as targets for therapeutic intervention [13] . Fusion peptides have been generally described as sequences of 15-25 apolar amino acids which locate to and order membranes on binding to enable the fusion process to begin [14] . The boundaries of coronavirus fusion peptides have yet to be precisely mapped, but the consensus is that the S fusion peptide lies in the N-terminus of the S2 domain, just downstream of the S1/S2 boundary [15] . For SARS-CoV S, mutagenesis, structural and lipid mixing studies have suggested a motif SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF which is conserved across the coronavirus family and within which the core sequence IEDLLF demonstrates only infrequent and conservative replacements [16, 17] . Most recently, this putative SARS fusion peptide has been shown to induce Ca 2+ -dependent membrane ordering consistent with its role during virus-host membrane fusion [18] .",

The identified sequence, which is related to the SARS-CoV putative fusion peptide [18] is not located at the N-terminus of HR1 as suggested in some S protein cleavage maps (e.g., [13] ), but immediately follows the second (S2 ) cleavage site originally mapped in SARS-CoV S and later in MERS-CoV S [22, 23] . Given its high degree of conservation and its location at a critical biologically relevant junction, the 15 residue wild type peptide was synthesized for in vitro activity assessment along with five variants in which selected hydrophobic residues previously Viruses 2019, 11, 825 4 of 9 implicated in the SARS fusion peptide were exchanged for alanine to probe those positions that were essential for activity (Table 1) .",

In addition, S is a target for therapeutic intervention via peptides that compete with the fusion reaction or the cleavage between S1 and S2 [13] . Here, alignments of the spike protein of MERS with several other coronavirus spike proteins revealed a conserved sequence just downstream of the S2 cleavage site with homology to a sequence previously reported to contain the fusion peptide of SARS S. Studies with the relevant peptide showed that it increased the size and deformed the shape of GUVs, consistent with the partition of the peptide into the external leaflet of the lipid membrane, as has been reported for peptides derived from other amphipathic membrane-inserting proteins such as Melittin [24] or Sar1p [29] .",

Together, the experimental data for the MERS sequence coupled with the similarity of the defined sequence with the data obtained for SARS suggest that the sequence RSARSAIEDLLFDKV and particularly the core sequence IEDLLF constitute the fusion peptide for MERS coronavirus S protein.
