Inter-university health collaboration such as the Nottingham Trent University (UK) and Makerere University School of Public Health (Uganda) partnership provide opportunities for working together in training, research and service delivery while strengthening health systems. This paper shares the experiences, achievements and opportunities of this partnership in co-learning and supporting the health system in Uganda. This includes a project being implemented to strengthen the training, supervision and motivation of community health workers in rural Uganda. Training and research are a key focus of the partnership and have involved both staff and students of both institutions including guest lectures, seminars and conference presentations. The partnership's collaboration with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health (Uganda) and local health authorities has ensured participation necessary in supporting implementation of sustainable interventions. The partnership uses several channels such as email, telephone, Skype, Dropbox and WhatsApp which have been useful in maintaining constant and effective communication. The challenges faced by the partnership include lack of funding to support student mobility, and varying academic schedules of the two institutions. The experiences and prospects of this growing partnership can inform other collaborations in similar settings.",

Health partnerships between institutions in the developed and developing world are becoming increasingly important in combating the 21st century global health challenges outlined above but more recently the focus has shifted towards the need to strengthen weak health systems in low and middle income countries. The challenge to build sustainable health systems requires the mobilization and strengthening of the workforce [5] and community health workers (CHWs) are now recognized as a core component of this strategy. Evidence shows that global health partnerships have many registered successes in reducing disease burden, mobilizing commitment and funding, and leading innovation [6] . Indeed, UK institutions including the government, non-governmental organizations, universities and individual professionals are making significant contributions towards strengthening healthcare systems in resource constrained countries [7] including Uganda.",

This was followed by several meetings facilitated in part by a Start-Up Grant provided to the partnership by Tropical Health & Education Trust (THET) which culminated in signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two universities. What we understood, even at that early stage, about each other's work was that we both worked in completely different cultural contexts in relation to public and environmental health in the UK and Uganda. In addition, we also shared an understanding that working with communities is central to delivering good public health and primary health care. Public health at NTU reflects their position in a School of Social Sciences and is framed through a social model of health, using social theory and focusing on themes of health promotion, sustainability and community development, international political economy of health, the 'contestedness' of core concepts of health and healing, and critical philosophical debates in public health. The international public health curriculum attracts overseas postgraduate and doctoral students, including many from Africa. Robust links with health promotion practitioners, environmental health professionals, and community volunteers in Nottingham have led to participatory research focusing on the grassroots in local communities.",

Initially, the partnership had a strong desire to learn from each other about our work in communities, an approach Crisp [7] talks about when he discusses the need to refocus and rebalance development approaches so that they are not uni-directional as they have tended to be in the past. Therefore, the MoU enabled us to formalize, in our respective institutions, our relationship which was important to develop our long term collaboration. The MoU sets out the principles that guide the partnership which include aims and vision, involvement of strategic partners, commitment to sustainability, and roles of partners. Our partnership thus aims to explore opportunities for potential collaboration in the following areas: exchange of information on programme development and teaching methods; exchange of staff and students; development of joint research and collaborative projects; and any other areas to promote the academic interests of both institutions in research and/or teaching. This paper shares the experiences, achievements and opportunities of this partnership in co-learning, and supporting the health system in Uganda through a project strengthening the capacity of community health workers.",

HPS is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and managed by THET. The aim of the work is to contribute to reducing the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases among the poorest communities in Uganda. Sub-Saharan Africa suffers a dual burden of disease with communicable diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, dysentery and malaria contributing 69 % of deaths, and non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity causing 25 % [8] . Upstream interventions through the promotion of health, provision of health education, and effective health communication are important strategies in reducing these diseases. Indeed, globally there is increasing recognition of the need for health systems to return to the core principles of a strong primary care system: community participation, health promotion and intersectoral collaboration [9, 10] . However, across many countries, these principles remains the most under resourced component of the Alma Ata vision. Understanding and addressing the broader social determinants of health is also an important part of the partnership's strategy and is clearly in line with Uganda's Ministry of Health (MOH) goal of reducing the occurrence of such diseases as expressed in the Uganda Health Plan [11] .",

A CHW has been defined as any health worker carrying out duties related to delivering health care, trained in some way in the context of their work, and having no formal professional training [12] . CHWs have increasingly become part of healthcare systems in most developing countries due to limited numbers of formally trained professional health workers, and are recognized as being the cornerstone in the system in order to deliver strong primary care particularly in rural communities. The human resources for health crisis is one of the factors underlying the poor performance of health systems to deliver effective, evidence-based interventions for priority health problems. This crisis is more critical in developing countries like Uganda which have registered a high rate of health workers migrating to work in developed countries in recent years [10] . CHWs can add significantly to the efforts of improving the health of the population, particularly in settings with the highest shortage of motivated and capable health professionals [13, 14] . In addition, where CHWs programmes exist, they are expected to increase equity and coverage of health services compared to alternative service delivery models [15] . Studies in developing countries, including Uganda, have also illustrated cost reduction and cost-effectiveness of community based tuberculosis care offered by CHWs [16, 17] .",

The UNMHCP is intended to provide every village in Uganda with the capacity to mobilize individuals and households for better health [19, 20] . The VHT comprises of community volunteers who are selected from within their communities to provide accurate health information, primary healthcare support and appropriate linkages to health services. They are the first point of contact for healthcare delivery in the community and have been incorporated by MOH into the health system as Health Centre I level. However, VHTs in Uganda are faced with various challenges that include inadequate training, minimal supervision and low motivation [21] . In addition, like in many other developing countries where similar CHWs programmes exist, they are marred with high attrition levels [22] and poor performance [13] . Our partnership therefore anticipated to create a significant impact on the country's health system by focusing on this cadre. VHTs mobilize community members and help to increase community participation in local health programmes. Other specific roles of VHTs include referring patients to health facilities, collecting household data, treating childhood diseases, conducting health education and acting as role models for community members.",

The needs assessment involved holding nine focus group discussions (FGDs) with CHWs, three each from urban, peri-urban and rural areas. In addition, ten key informant interviews (KIIs) were held in those communities. The key informants were health assistants (three), CHWs supervisors (three) and local leaders (four). The FGDs and KIIs were conducted by an experienced researcher with support of a research assistant. This needs assessment supplemented earlier findings [21] and confirmed the existence of several challenges affecting CHWs in the country. It was established that although CHWs did a tremendous job in primary health care and public health, they experienced several challenges that affected their work. These included insufficient initiation training, limited continuous training, lack of basic necessities such as gloves, minimal incentives for motivation, limited reference materials, minimal support supervision, and the available guides being in English (yet the majority could only read the local language). The needs assessment also established that although all four CHWs per village, who were mainly selected by the community, are involved in general duties such as health education and home visiting, only two of them were involved in integrated community case management (iCCM) of childhood illnesses (malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia). For the UK partners, these results enabled them to see the challenges facing CHWs at local level. At the same time, it was also appreciated that community development programmes using CHWs often suffer from issues such as lack of funding.",

This survey was conducted among all the CHWs in Ssisa sub-county, Wakiso district where the project is being implemented. Review of existing literature on CHWs in Uganda as well as related MOH policy documents were also reviewed. The survey established that out of the 300 CHWs to be targeted by the project, only 191 (63.7 %) were functional hence active. The non-functionality of many CHWs was established to be because of not having had an opportunity to be trained so as to be able to carry out their duties, and others who had initially been trained having dropped out of the programme. From interaction with the supervisors of CHWs, there was a higher drop-out rate of CHWs not involved in iCCM because they had received less attention from national programmes including in terms of training, supervision and motivation. The majority (95.8 %, 183/191) of active CHWs reported receiving initiation training on their work which was conducted in 2010. However, a third (32.8 %, 60/183) of them had not undergone any other training besides the initiation training. The supervisors of CHWs reported lack of transport as the main challenge in performing their duties which included delivering supplies to CHWs, and collecting monthly reports and delivering them to health facilities. Despite their key role in the CHWs programme, supervisors noted that they had received minimal training regarding their supervisory duties. This was evident given the fact that many of them could not appropriately complete the supervisory forms that were provided to them.",

However, few CHWs still had these items at the time of the survey and majority were worn-out since most of them had been received in 2010 without replacement. Although all the CHWs had never received gumboots and umbrellas, it was established that these items were necessary in performing their work especially in the rainy season. Indeed, the CHWs stressed the importance of the various incentives in carrying out their duties. Whereas most (98.4 %, 188/191) of the CHWs owned mobile phones, almost half (49.5 %, 93/188) charged them from commercial places, often characterized by travelling long distances to and from the charging points. The findings of the baseline survey further emphasized the gaps in the CHWs programme in Ssisa sub-county, Wakiso district hence the need for support.

The students received support in the field from staff and students at MakSPH. They also volunteered in on-going partnership activities in Uganda such as workshops, seminars and conferences. In addition, members of NTU have made several presentations over the period of the partnership at the Makerere University Environmental Health Students' Association (MUEHSA) conference organized annually by students of Environmental Health at MakSPH. This has increased the opportunities for transferring knowledge and sharing research findings between the two countries. The participation of UK partners in MUEHSA conferences plays a major role in enhancing inter-disciplinary knowledge about global public health issues for the Ugandan students. NTU and MakSPH staff have also made several guest seminar presentations during their respective visits to host institutions. Staff members of MakSPH have also participated in guest class lectures at NTU on Masters programmes, two of which were conducted via Skype to discuss issues of community participation from the field experience of the researchers. Our partnership base has been broadened by working with a Nottingham based health promotion practitioner with extensive experience in community development, monitoring and evaluation. Support for the partnership from the MOH, CHWs representatives and local health authorities is critical in the implementation of various research activities, and the building of trust and reciprocity underpins our activities in the field.",
