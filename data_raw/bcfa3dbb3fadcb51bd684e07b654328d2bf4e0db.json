Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits. The aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam in eight New Zealand White rabbits. Subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was followed by IV administration of a mixture of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL sufentanil and 0.45 mg/mL midazolam at a rate of 0.3 mL/kg BW/h for anaesthetic induction. Additionally, intravenous boluses of 0.1 mL of the mixture were administered every 20 s until the righting reflex was lost. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained for 60 min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex. Air and oxygen (1:2) were delivered at 3 L/min. Physiological variables were recorded before induction and at predefined time points during and after anaesthesia.",

Doses of sufentanil and midazolam were 0.48 \u03bcg/kg BW and 0.09 mg/kg BW for induction, and 0.72 \u03bcg/kg BW/h and 0.13 mg/kg BW/h for maintenance. Apnoea occurred in two rabbits. Induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial CO 2 partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and pH. Mean time from stopping the infusion to endotracheal extubation was 5 min, and to return of the righting reflex 7 min. Anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex. Conclusions: TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation is needed to establish if the protocol is useful for rabbits undergoing surgery.",

It is also the third most common pet species anaesthetised in the United Kingdom [2] . Rabbits are high risk anaesthesia patients, with a mortality risk 14 times higher than in dogs [3] . Possible reasons for this are that rabbits are easily stressed prey animals, they are difficult to intubate endotracheally and react to mask induction with volatile anaesthetics by extended breath-holding [4] [5] [6] . Rabbits have a large abdominal cavity in relation to the thoracic cavity, with the results that the pressure from the intestinal mass may interfere with respiration in dorsal recumbency during anaesthesia. Furthermore, obesity is increasing in pet rabbits, which also adds to the problem. Respiratory infection with Pasteurella pneumotropica, which is common in pet rabbits, may cause a reduction of the hydrogen ion driven respiratory drive, adding to the anaesthetic risk [7] .",

To avoid apnoea, anaesthesia must be induced slowly. Midazolam alone can cause apnoea in humans if infused too quickly IV [28] .

Despite marked respiratory depression, we chose to ventilate the rabbits minimally in order to evaluate the extent of respiratory depression. It is likely that the respiratory depression had an effect on other variables, such as the HR. However, experience shows that during short term anaesthesia, some degree of hypercapnia (6-7 kPa) is well tolerated in healthy cats and dogs [35] , and may even be beneficial since it stimulates respiration and increases blood flow to the brain [36] . The occurrence of apnoea during maintenance of anaesthesia necessitates the use of mechanical ventilation, which is the main disadvantage of the protocol since it requires successful endotracheal intubation as well as the knowledge and skills of using a ventilator.",

If intubation caused the increased HR in the present study, the medetomidine and sufentanil doses used must have been insufficient to prevent the response. The simultaneous hypercapnia and hypotension that developed may also have contributed to the increase in HR.

A high prevalence of hypotension, defined as a MAP < 60 mm Hg, has been reported in rabbits anaesthetized with e.g. isoflurane, haltothane or ketamine-medetomidine [8, 33, 43] . Maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane in NZW rabbits will give rise to MAP in the range of 33-82 mmHg [8] . The pressure measured in the auricular artery has been shown to be approximately 8 mm Hg lower than in the carotid artery [38] . In the present study MAP in the sedated rabbits (~70 mmHg) was lower than reported in non-sedated unrestrained resting rabbits (~80 mmHg), [37] and similar to MAP in rabbits after IV administration of 10 \u03bcg/kg BW dexmedetomidine (~75 mmHg), [44] . Midazolam alone [45] or in combination with sufentanil [24] , has been shown to decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure in dogs, however MAP did not fall below 65 mmHg [24] . In humans, sufentanil-midazolam also decreases MAP (~75 mm Hg), [46, 47] . In contrast to the present study, the human and dog studies included major surgery, which may have affected MAP. Uncorrected hypotension may contribute to the high mortality levels in rabbit anaesthesia [8] and cardiovascular support, which is routine in other animal species during anaesthesia, may possibly decrease mortality rates.",

Infusion was started at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/kg BW/h with a syringe pump (Braun Compact S). After 1 minute, 0.1 mL boluses of the same mixture were administered IV every 20 seconds, until induction was complete, as judged by loss of the righting reflex and muscle relaxation (loss of jaw and limb muscle tone). During induction, the rabbit was breathing 100% oxygen (2 L/min) from a face mask. Starting the infusion before bolus administration has been shown to prevent muscle rigidity, which is commonly caused by opioids [21] .",
