Host cell factors required for viral spread but not for cellular survival are attractive targets for novel approaches to antiviral intervention. The cleavage activation of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. However, it is unknown which proteases activate influenza viruses in mammals. Several candidates have been identified in cell culture studies, leading to the concept that influenza viruses can employ multiple enzymes to ensure their cleavage activation in the host. Here, we show that deletion of a single HA-activating protease gene, Tmprss2, in mice inhibits spread of monobasic H1N1 influenza viruses, including the pandemic 2009 swine influenza virus. Lung pathology was strongly reduced and mutant mice were protected from weight loss, death and impairment of lung function. Also, after infection with mono-basic H3N2 influenza A virus body weight loss and survival was less severe in Tmprss2 mutant compared to wild type mice. As expected, Tmprss2-deficient mice were not protected from viral spread and pathology after infection with multi-basic H7N7 influenza A virus. In conclusion, these results identify TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor essential for viral spread and pathogenesis of mono-basic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.",

The HA proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses harbor multiple basic amino acids at their cleavage site and are activated by furin [4] . In contrast, low pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses contain a mono-basic cleavage site in their HA proteins. Several studies showed that multiple secreted proteases can activate human influenza viruses for infection of cell lines (see [5, 6] for examples and [7] for a review). However, the analysis of cultured human respiratory epithelium demonstrated that influenza virus cleavage activation is a cell-associated process and no evidence for a role of secreted proteases was obtained [8] . Subsequently, the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family member TMPRSS2, a membrane associated protease, was shown to activate HA proteins of diverse human influenza viruses in cell culture [9, 10, 11, 12] . In addition, TMPRSS2 was found to be expressed in human respiratory epithelium positive for alpha 2,6linked sialic acid [13] . However, the role of TMPRSS2 in influenza virus spread and pathogenesis in the infected host has not yet been studied.",

Our study shows that deletion of Tmprss2 in knock-out mice strongly limits virus spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection.

Non-infected Tmprss2 knock-out mice did not show a phenotype in the absence of infection, as described previously [14] and RT-PCR analysis of kidney tissue confirmed the absence of full length Tmprss2 transcripts. Upon intranasal infection of mice with mouseadapted PR8M (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 M\u00fcnster variant, [15] ), wild type mice lost weight significantly after infection and 50% of infected mice died, whereas Tmprss2 knock-out mice did not exhibit body weight loss and showed no signs of disease (Figs. 1A; Fig. S1 ). The same results were obtained after infection with a human isolate of the pandemic HA4 (A/Hamburg/4/2009 H1N1) virus ( Figure 1B) . Also, after infection with a lethal dose of the more virulent PR8F virus isolate (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 Freiburg variant) all wild-type mice died within seven days post infection whereas no knock-out mice showed symptoms of disease ( Figure 1C ). Similar results were observed for blood oxygen saturation levels which provide a measurement for lung function. Whereas wild type mice exhibited a significant drop in peripheral blood oxygen saturation that peaked at day 8 post infection (p.i.) with PR8M virus, Tmprss2 2/2 mutant mice showed only a very mild change ( Figure 2 ).",

Here, we report that the deletion of a single host protease gene, Tmprss2, in mice protects the host against viral spread in infected lungs. Only very mild pathogenesis was observed in Tmprss2 mutant mice after infection with H1N1 virus and less severe pathogenesis was observed after infection with H3N2 virus.

However, an initial increase in viral titers was measured from day 1 to day 2 p.i. whereas at later times p.i. viral titers rapidly decreased. This initial increase in viral titers is expected because the virus used for infections had been produced in embryonated chicken eggs. It therefore carries an activated HA allowing it to enter cells and replicate [19, 20] . In addition, it is conceivable that other proteases besides TMPRSS2 may facilitate low levels of H1 cleavage and allow limited viral spread which is rapidly cleared once the antiviral immune responses have been activated. However, the cleavage activation by such alternative enzymes must be very inefficient since viral titers in H1N1 infected Tmprss2 2/2 mice were markedly reduced compared to wild type animals and no weight loss was observed. Surprisingly, H3N2 virus which also carries a mono-basic cleavage site in the HA, was able to replicate in Tmprss2 2/2 mice. However, body weight loss and mortality were significantly reduced in knock-out mice compared to wild type mice in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, viral load was not significantly lower in mutant mice after infection with 2610 3 FFU. The amino acid sequence in the HA loop which is recognized by proteases differs between HA subtypes H1 and H3 (Figure 9) . A recent study demonstrated that different proteases, including TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11d (HAT) and even trypsin, cleave HA from different subtypes and variants with varying efficiency [21] . In addition, ST14 (matriptase) has the capability to cleave HA of particular H1 subtype strains but only minimal cleavage was observed for H2 and H3 [22] . Furthermore, KLK5 and 12 (kallikrein related-peptidase 5 and 12) have been described as host proteases that are capable of cleavage activation of viral H1, H2 and H3 HA in vitro [23] . Thus, H3N2 appears to be processed to some extent by TMPRSS2, resulting in the reduced pathology in Tmprss2 knock-out mice but also other proteases are able to cleave H3 hemagglutinin in vivo. Finally, it is noteworthy that Tmprss2 2/2 mutant mice were not protected from infection with an H7N7 virus which contains a multi-basic HA cleavage site and can be activated by ubiquitously expressed proteases [4] .",

Broad spectrum protease inhibitors have been shown to inhibit influenza virus in cell culture and in vivo [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] but unwanted side effects are a major concern. The results reported here suggest that targeting a single protease, TMPRSS2, may be sufficient to achieve a notable therapeutic benefit against H1N1 influenza viruses and possibly other subtypes. Blocking of TMPRSS2 may not be associated with severe unwanted side effects, since Tmprss2 2/2 mice are healthy and do not show any phenotypic alterations in the absence of an infection [14] . Furthermore, TMPRSS2 inhibitors might exert activity against diverse respiratory infections. For example, human metapneumovirus [29] , the emerging MERS-coronavirus [30, 31] and SARS-coronavirus [32, 33, 34] can also be activated by TMPRSS2 in cell culture and might use this protease to support their spread in the infected host.

            "text": "Tmprss2 Knock-out Influenza Resistance stocks of PR8 were prepared by infection of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and for HA4 on MDCK cells as described [37] . Mutant Tmprss2 2/2 mice were on a mixed C57BL/6J -129 background [14] . Animals were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions at the animal facility of the HZI in Braunschweig. Heterozygous mutant mice were interbred and wild type, heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice were genotyped by PCR analysis and then used for infections. Genotyping of Tmprss2 alleles was carried out using a three primer strategy (P1 59TGTGCCCTTGGACAGATGACTC39, P2 59GGACTACAGATATGAGGTGTTC39, P3 59AGGCCA-GAGGCCACTTGTGTAG39) that allows to distinguish between wild type (yielding a 540 bp product) and knock-out (yielding a 400 bp product) alleles, respectively. Expression plasmids encoding human and mouse proteases TMPRSS2 were published earlier [10, 13] . Previously described expression plasmids for PR8M [38] were used as templates for amplification of the respective coding regions using oligonucleotides PR8-HA-5Acc: GGGGGTAC-CACCATGAAGGCAAACCTACTGGTCCTG, PR8-HA-3Nhe: GGGCGCTAGCTCAGATGCATATTCTGCACTG. The resulting PCR products were inserted into plasmid pCAGGS using the Acc65I and NheI sites. For cloning of HA4 HA protein, expression plasmid kindly provided by Prof. Klenk [39] was used as templates for amplification of the coding region using Figure 7 . Tmprss2 knock-out mice show reduced mortality after infection with high dose H3N2 influenza A virus infections. Eight to eleven weeks old female mice were infected with 2610 3 FFU mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intra-nasal application and survival (A) was monitored until day 14 p.i. In addition to mice that were found dead, mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. Infectious viral particles were determined in lung homogenates (B). Individual values, mean and SEM are presented. Detection limit of the assay is at 80 infectious particles per lung indicated by the blue line. Homozygous Tmprss2 knock-out mice showed significantly reduced mortality compared to wild type and heterozygote mice (p,0.0001 and p = 0.0032, respectively, using the log rank test). Viral load was not significantly different in infected wild type mice compared to infected homozygous mutant mice at days 1 to 3 p.i. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003774.g007",

Serial lung sections were stained at day 1 and day 3 p.i. with anti-influenza antibody and haematoxylin (A-H) or with haematoxylin/eosin (I-P). The overall lung tissues were more densely consolidated with larger numbers of infiltrating immune cells in wild type (I-L) compared to Tmprss2 2/2 mice (M-P). In addition, the airways of Tmprss2 +/+ mice were surrounded by higher numbers neutrophils and macrophages (I-L) whereas airways of Tmprss2 2/2 mice showed lower numbers of immune cell infiltrations (M-P). Virus-infected cells at day 1 p.i. were observed mainly in bronchiolar regions in the lungs of both mice (A, B, E, F). Both wild type and mutant mice showed influenzapositive cells at day 3 p.i. (C, G). However, the overall number of infected cells was lower in Tmprss2 2/2 compared to wild type mice. Furthermore, infected cells were mostly limited to bronchiolar regions in Tmprss2 2/2 whereas in wild type mice the virus also spread significantly into the alveolar regions (D, H). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.",
