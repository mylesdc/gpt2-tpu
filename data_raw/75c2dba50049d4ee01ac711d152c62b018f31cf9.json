            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), one of the most important lethal infections of cats, is caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the high-virulence biotype of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs). FIPVs are suggested to emerge from feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) by acquiring mutations in specific genes in the course of persistent infections. Although numerous studies identified mutations predicted to be responsible for the FECV-FIPV biotype switch, the presumed roles of specific genetic changes in FIP pathogenesis have not been confirmed experimentally. Reverse genetics systems established previously for serotype I and the less common serotype II FCoVs were based on cell culture-adapted FIPV strains which, however, were shown to be unsuitable for FIP pathogenesis studies in vivo. To date, systems to produce and manipulate recombinant serotype I field viruses have not been developed, mainly because these viruses cannot be grown in vitro. Here, we report the first reverse genetics system based on a serotype I FECV field isolate that is suitable to produce high-titer stocks of recombinant FECVs. We demonstrate that these recombinant viruses cause productive persistent infections in cats that are similar to what is observed in natural infections. The system provides an excellent tool for studying FCoVs that do not grow in standard cell culture systems and will greatly facilitate studies into the molecular pathogenesis of FIP. Importantly, the system could also be adapted for studies of other RNA viruses with large genomes whose production and characterization in vivo are currently hampered by the lack of in vitro propagation systems. IMPORTANCE The availability of recombinant serotype I FCoV field isolates that are amenable to genetic manipulation is key to studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP, especially since previous studies using cell culture-adapted FIPVs had proven unsuccessful. To our knowledge, we report the first serotype I FECV field isolatebased reverse genetics system that allows the production of high-titer recombinant virus stocks that can be used for subsequent in vivo studies in cats. The system represents a milestone in FCoV research. It provides an essential tool for studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP and, more specifically, the functions of specific gene products in causing a fundamentally different progression of disease following acquisition of specific mutations. The system developed in this study will also be useful for studying other coronaviruses or more distantly related RNA viruses with large genomes for which suitable in vitro culture systems are not available.",

They are most closely related to members of the Torovirinae, which form a second subfamily in the family Coronaviridae. Together with three other families (Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae), the Coronaviridae are part of the order Nidovirales (1) . Coronaviridae are divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are closely related to canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); all three have been classified as one virus species called Alphacoronavirus 1. Other more distantly related viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus include, for example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (2) .",

On the basis of antigenic properties, FCoVs can be classified into two serotypes (5) (6) (7) . The vast majority (80% to 95%) of natural infections occurring worldwide are caused by serotype I FCoVs, while serotype II FCoVs are less common in the field and mainly occur in Asia (3, (8) (9) (10) (11) . Interestingly, serotype II FCoVs evolve by recombination between serotype I FCoVs and CCoVs (12) (13) (14) (15) . For both FCoV serotypes, two biotypes with fundamentally different pathogenicities in cats have been defined. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes persistent infections of the gut with only minor or no clinical symptoms (16) (17) (18) . In sharp contrast, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the second biotype, causes a fatal systemic disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

            "text": "It is now generally accepted that harmless FECVs evolve into highly pathogenic FIPVs by accumulating mutations in their genomes (24, 25) . The parental FECV and the resulting FIPV from the same cat are referred to as a \"virus pair.\" To date, the mutations responsible for FECV-FIPV biotype switch have not been identified. However, on the basis of extensive comparative sequence analyses of FECV and FIPV isolates, it was concluded that mutations in the S and accessory genes are involved in the development of FIP (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . In this regard, accessory gene 3c attracted particular interest because it was found to contain deletions, frameshift mutations, and other nonsynonymous mutations in about 80% of the FIPV isolates, while FECVs carry an intact 3c gene. Accordingly, mutations in 3c were considered important virulence markers associated with FIP development (25, 32) . More-recent publications suggest that an intact 3c gene is required for viral replication in the gut and that, in contrast to previous suggestions, 3c mutations are not necessarily linked to the development of FIP (26, (33) (34) (35) . However, at this stage, the possibility cannot be excluded that mutations leading to truncation or loss of 3c coding sequences contribute to the emergence of viruses causing FIP. In reports of recent studies based on comparative sequence analyses of complete FECV and FIPV genomes, three substitutions in the S gene were suggested to discriminate FIPVs from FECV (26) (27) (28) . Two of these changes were located in the fusion peptide (FP) and one in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of the S protein.",

However, the idea that particular mutations in the FCoV S gene and/or accessory genes indeed lead to a biotype switch from FECV to FIPV remains to be experimentally verified. In order to assess the involvement of mutations in FIPV development, the generation of well-defined viruses by reverse genetics is required (37) . One major obstacle for studies on the molecular pathogenesis of FIP is the failure to grow serotype I field FECVs/FIPVs in standard cell culture systems (38) . Thus far, reverse genetics systems for FECV field isolates have not been available. Only a few serotype I FIPV laboratory strains can be grown in vitro, but those viruses lost their ability to induce FIP due to cell culture adaptation (6, (39) (40) (41) (42) . Although serotype II FIPVs can be grown in cell culture and some of them also induce FIP, the lack of corresponding serotype II FECVs limits their use (15, 17) .",

Vaccinia virus-based systems have been shown to be excellent tools for the generation and genetic manipulation of full-length coronavirus (CoV) cDNA clones that can be used to produce full-length genome RNA that, following transfection, initiates a viral replication in suitable cells (40, (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Generally, virus titers obtained after transfection (passage 0) are low and the production of high-titer virus stocks of the recombinant viruses requires an amplification step in vitro. Accordingly, reverse genetic systems have been established only for CoVs (including FCoVs) for which cell culture systems are available that efficiently support viral replication (40, (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. To address this problem, we sought to recover recombinant FECV without any in vitro passaging steps. As a first step toward this goal, we generated a recombinant serotype I FECV in which the S gene was replaced with that of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. The latter virus was chosen as an S gene donor because previous experiments had demonstrated that this particular S gene conveyed efficient viral growth in vitro (40, 47) . Using this approach, we sought to address the issue of whether the genome of the FECV field isolate characterized in this study supports the replication of and gives rise to the production of infectious FECV progeny when engineered as a chimera with the 79-1146 S gene.",

As shown in Fig. 1A , the modification of vrecFCoV-II was carried out in multiple steps by vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination. First, the 79-1146-derived sequences downstream of the S gene (3a, 3b, 3c, E, M, N, 7a, 7b, and the 3=UTR) were replaced by the corresponding parts of the FECV field isolate cDNA, resulting in vrecFCoV-II-FECV 3a-3\u00b4UTR . Second, serotype II-derived 5=UTR and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) sequences were removed from the cDNA and the serotype II ORF1b was replaced by the corresponding FECV part. Thus, the resulting vrecFECV 1b-3'UTR -S 79 vaccinia virus contained the FECV-derived ORF1b, ORF3abc, E, M, N, 7ab, and 3=UTR sequences and the S gene of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146.

            "text": "Generation and characterization of recombinant serotype I FECV. Our ultimate goal was the generation and recovery of a recombinant serotype I FECV without any heterologous sequences. Accordingly, the experiment performed with chimeric virus recFECV-S 79 as described above was only an intermediate step. To generate recombinant serotype I FECV field virus with its authentic FECV S gene, the serotype II S sequence in vrecFECV-S 79 was replaced with the appropriate S gene from the FECV field isolate, resulting in vrecFECV ( Fig. 2A) . The recovery of recombinant viruses from the full-length FECV cDNA was performed as described above. Since serotype I FECV cannot be propagated in vitro, we expected that recombinant viruses would not be able to grow in cell culture. It was therefore not surprising that inoculation of FCWF cells with the supernatant of electroporated cells did not lead to a CPE. Moreover, FECV-specific antigens could not be detected with a monoclonal antibody (anti-M) by immunofluorescence. To address the issue of whether FECV particles were released from the electroporated cells, the cell culture supernatant was subjected to an ultracentrifugation step and the pellet obtained was used for further analyses, including (i) electron microscopy, (ii) Western blotting, and (iii) RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B , transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that in the supernatant of electroporated cells, virus particles with coronavirus-like morphological features, including the typical spike structures, were present which looked indistinguishable from recFECV-S 79 particles. To verify that the recFCoV particles contained CoV structural proteins, we performed a Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C , a prominent band corresponding to the FECV structural M protein could be detected, corroborating the release of recFCoV particles from the transfected cells. Next, the incorporation of viral genome RNA into these particles was assessed by using a capsid protection assay as described previously (49) . For this purpose, purified particles were subjected to RNase treatment to remove any free viral RNA prior to RNA extraction from the virus particles. The presence of viral genome RNA in these particles was confirmed by RT-PCR.",

As indicated above, the titer of this virus could not be determined by plaque assay. We therefore decided to use a Western blot analysis to estimate the amount of M protein present in purified recFECV particles. As a reference, we used the M protein content of a control virus that was known to produce infectious virus progeny following electroporation of viral genome RNA and that can be titrated by virus plaque assay. Following electroporation of in vitro-transcribed full-length genome RNAs of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 , respectively, in a parallel experiment, cell culture supernatants of electroporated cells were collected and subjected to two rounds of ultracentrifugation. The pellet fractions were resuspended in identical volumes of NTE buffer. Equal amounts of the purified recFECV and recFECV-S 79 stocks, along with 1:2 and 1:10 dilutions prepared from these stocks, were subjected to Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody to compare the amounts of M protein present in the viral rescue experiments performed with recFECV and recFECV-S 79 , respectively (Fig. 2D) . Quantification of the M protein signals in the respective diluted and undiluted fractions revealed very similar amounts of this protein for recFECV and recFECV-S 79 (Fig. 2E ). On the basis of the comparison of the M protein contents and the titers determined for recFECV-S 79 using a virus plaque assay with FCWF cells (5 \u03eb 10 6 PFU/ ml), we concluded that recFECV also contained about 5 \u03eb 10 6 virus particles/ml. To further support this conclusion, we also determined the genome copy numbers in all fractions (stock and dilutions 1:2 and 1:10) of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after removal of possible RNA molecules outside the particles (capsid protection assay). This experiment revealed very similar genomic RNA amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 in both the undiluted and the diluted material (Fig. 2F ). . The intensity of the bands was analyzed using a ChemiDoc imaging system and Image Lab software. The intensity of each band was compared to that of the recFECV-S 79 stock.

While the virus particles with serotype II spike (recFECV-S 79 ) enabled efficient infection of cat cells, the authentic FECV spike did not allow the virus to grow and spread in a cell monolayer in vitro. The lack of CPE development and FECV-specific antigens in FCWF cells inoculated with recFECV-containing cell culture supernatant suggests that the in vitro propagation of recFECVs critically depends on the particular S gene used to construct this virus rather than on other viral genes. Furthermore, in spite of the inability to passage recFECV in vitro, we showed that similarly large amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 virions could be recovered from cells in passage 0 without further amplification by viral passaging in permissive cells.",

Later, fecal samples from these cats were found to be positive only sporadically until the end of the study (Fig. 3A ). To rule out the possibility that the negative results were due to the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR used in these studies, we subsequently used a qRT-PCR assay to reevaluate a total of 16 fecal samples (2 samples/week/cat) collected from cats 3 and 4. Two samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 1 week p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR also tested positive using the qRT-PCR assay. The swabs obtained from cat 3 were found to contain 4.7 \u03eb 10 3 and 2.9 \u03eb 10 3 genome copies, respectively, while the swabs obtained from cat 4 contained 2.3 \u03eb 10 3 and 1 \u03eb 10 4 genome copies. Similarly, samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 4 weeks p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR tested positive by qRT-PCR (3.45 \u03eb 10 2 and 4.14 \u03eb 10 2 genome copies for cats 3 and 4, respectively). The remaining samples collected from cats 3 and 4, respectively, that had tested negative by nested RT-PCR (week 2 to 8) remained also negative by the qRT-PCR assay. These data indicate that analyses of the results from the two assays (nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR) led to the same conclusions.",

The titers against recFECV were determined using type I FCoV-infected CRFK cells, whereas the recFECV-S 79 titers were measured using type II FCoV-infected cells. Upon infection with recFECV (cats 1 and 2), the serum antibody peak titers that developed were lower than the titers observed for the cats infected with recFECV-S 79 (cats 3 and 4). In the cats inoculated intraperitoneally (cats 2 and 4), serum antibodies developed faster and reached peak titers earlier. After intraperitoneal infection of cat 4 with recFECV-S 79 , the serum antibody reached peak titers of \u03fe1: 20,480 at 3 weeks p.i. and, after a few more weeks, declined to 1:2,560. The serum antibody titers determined for cat 3, which was infected oronasally with the same virus, reached similar peak titers (\u03fe1:20,480) but only after 7 weeks p.i. The serum antibody responses were found to be similar for the two cats infected with recFECV (cats 1 and 2), with slightly higher titers being regularly observed for cat 2, which had been infected via the intraperitoneal route. While the serum antibodies reached a peak titer of 1:2,560 in cat 2, a peak titer of 1:320 was measured for cat 1, with no further increase being recorded after week 5 p.i.",

To conclude the animal experiment, we performed additional studies using postmortem samples obtained from cat 1, which had been infected oronasally with recFECV. To analyze virus spread in vivo and determine sites of viral replication, the cat was euthanized and a range of organs, including lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and abdominal lymph node samples as well as gut sections, were collected and used for subsequent analyses. Using nested RT-PCR, FCoV-specific RNA could be detected only in the colon samples. To clarify whether the negative results were due to the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR, we reinvestigated all organ samples by a qRT-PCR assay. The obtained results were in complete agreement with the outcome of the nested RT-PCR assay. As before, FCoV RNA was exclusively detected in colon samples (4.6 \u03eb 10 5 genome copies/g tissue). Consistent with this, an immunohistochemistry (IHC) study revealed that FCoV-specific antigens could be detected only in samples originating from the colon (Fig. 4) . These data are in agreement with the localization of FECV nucleic acid and proteins reported for naturally occurring persistent FECV infections (18, 54, 55) and corroborate our conclusion that the recFECV generated in this study is able to establish persistent infections that are similar to those caused by FECVs from the field.",

Notably, six nonsynonymous mutations were found in the S gene, two in the M gene, and one in nsp4.

The biotype switch from FECV to FIPV (i.e., the lethal biotype of FCoV) has been estimated to occur in approximately 5% of persistently infected cats (4, 59) . Over the past years, significant efforts by several laboratories have been made to identify genetic changes that are involved in FECVto-FIPV biotype switches. This information is essential for understanding the molecular basis of FIP pathogenesis, which, in turn, may help the development of new diagnostic tools and, possibly, novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to combat this important disease. Differences between the genomes of FECVs and FIPVs have been identified by comparative sequence analyses of FECVs and FIPVs and were assumed to be responsible for the biotype switch (26) (27) (28) (29) . Although the described changes correlate with the emergence of FIPV, the specific contribution(s) of single or combined amino acid substitutions to viral pathogenesis and disease progression in infected cats was not established because suitable experimental systems were not available at the time. For this, recombinant viruses with known genome sequences, along with a set of genetically engineered mutants derived from this particular parental virus, have to be generated by reverse genetics and characterized in animal experiments. Unfortunately, FECV field isolates do not grow in cell culture and, more specifically, fail to produce infectious virus progeny unless they are adapted to in vitro growth conditions by serial passaging, which is known to result in mutations in different regions of the viral genome. The lack of suitable cell culture systems also posed a major obstacle in the development of reverse genetics approaches for these viruses. So far, reverse genetics systems have not been established for any of the field viruses, apart from several cell culture-adapted FCoV strains that, however, turned out to be unsuitable for studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP (37, 40, 46, 60, 61) . The major hurdle in establishing reverse genetics systems for FECV field isolates was the inability to recover infectious recombinant viruses from a cDNA clone. We therefore consider it a major achievement that an efficient FECV rescue system could be developed in the present study. Following extensive procedures performed to optimize a previously established vaccinia virus-based system (40, 44, 46, 47) , high-titer recFECV virus stocks were produced.",

            "text": "Recombinant FECVs were generated using a two-step strategy. First, we sought to confirm that the serotype I FECV-derived backbone enables efficient viral replication if combined with the S gene of the serotype II FIPV strain 79-1146. The latter was used because this particular S protein was previously shown to support virus growth in cell culture irrespective of the FCoV backbone used (40, 47) . The resulting chimeric virus, recFECV-S 79 , could be rescued and grown to high titers in vitro, confirming that the FECV backbone was fully functional. Second, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the full-length FECV cDNA (including the authentic S gene). Next, BHK cells expressing the FECV N protein were electroporated with recombinant full-length recFECV RNA and supernatants collected from these cells were used to inoculate feline cells. Given that these cells are not permissive for type I field FCoVs, we were not surprised that neither CPE nor FECV-specific antigens could be detected in cat cells inoculated with the supernatant of electroporated BHK cells. However, using a range of methods, we were able to show that recFECVs had been released from the electroporated cells. The release of coronavirus-like particles was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, and the identity of purified (and RNase-treated) particles was corroborated further by RT-PCR analysis using FECV genome RNA-specific primers and Western blotting with a FCoV M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. The M protein content and genomic RNA content determined for the recFECV and recFECV-S 79 preparations were found to be very similar (Fig. 2D to F) , which led us to conclude that the rescue efficiencies were similar for the two viruses. The data also support the idea that the in vitro propagation of recombinant FECVs exclusively depends on the type of the spike protein of virus particles. Next, we addressed the issue of whether recFECV can induce a productive infection in the natural host. Cats were infected with recFECV or recFECV-S 79 using equal amounts of virus. In the two groups, the virus was applied oronasally to one cat and intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the other. Infection with recFECV resulted in continuous virus shedding during the entire course of the experiment. Of 61 fecal swab samples obtained on a daily basis, 57 and 59 samples were found to be FCoV positive (by nested RT-PCR) in the cats infected oronasally and intraperitoneally, respectively. These data show that, irrespective of the infection route, recFECV established persistent infections of the gut. The analysis of FCoV-specific antibody responses revealed that recFECV induced relatively low antibody titers that were very similar to what was previously reported for natural infections with FECV (8, 54, 62) . Similar results were observed after oronasal infection of two additional cats (cats 5 and 6) in an independent experiment, indicating that recFECV could reproducibly induce a harmless persistent infection. To determine the major sites of recFECV replication in vivo, the cat infected oronasally (cat 1) was subjected to a postmortem analysis at 8.5 weeks postinfection. Among the large number of tissue samples collected, only the colon tissue samples tested positive for FCoV M protein and viral genome, while viral RNA and protein could not be detected in other tissue samples, confirming that recFECV had established a persistent infection of the colon. This observation is in agreement with the localization of the virus reported for natural FECV infections (18, 54, 55) . Finally, we determined the recFECV sequence from fecal samples collected right before the cat was euthanized. The sequence analysis revealed that the majority of nonsynonymous nucleotide changes mapped to the S gene and particularly to the S1 subunit. Desmarets et al. found 8 nonsynonymous mutations in the S1 subunit of the FCoV spike at 84 days p.i. (50) . Since the S1 domain is known to be a major antigenic determinant for the induction of adaptive immune responses (54, (63) (64) (65) (66) , it is conceivable that the observed changes in this subunit represent immune escape variants. A structural model produced by Protein Homology/ analogy Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre 2) for the recFECV S1 subunit suggests that the observed amino acid substitutions in the S1 domain map to surface regions outside the receptor-binding site (Fig. 5) . This localization of amino acid substitutions on the surface of the S1 subunit (including its 0 domain) strongly suggests that these changes might contribute to viral escape from the host immune system rather than increasing/ adjusting the affinity to a cellular receptor as suggested in a previous study of the HCoV-229E S protein (67) . Taken together, the recFECV sequence data obtained from samples collected at a late stage of infection provide independent evidence that the recFECV produced in this study is adapted to the specific ecologic niche from which it was initially isolated (i.e., feline colon). Thus, recFECV can be expected to provide an excellent tool for future studies into the biological properties of FECVs and the genetic changes required to generate the FIPV biotype.",

The samples tested positive (with nested RT-PCR) only sporadically (in 12 and 11 of 61 fecal swab samples) in the cats infected oronasally and intraperitoneally, respectively. Data generated by qRT-PCR confirmed these results. Interestingly, and in contrast to the titers obtained for FCoV, very high (\u03fe1:20,480) serum antibody titers were determined for both recFECV-S 79 -infected cats, reflecting a strong immune response that was most likely due to a systemic infection. The lack of clinical symptoms in the cats infected with FECV-S 79 indicates that the S protein alone of an FIPV strain does not lead to a biotype switch even though it may be responsible for a transition from an enteric to a systemic infection. Interestingly, by the time of necropsy (8.5 weeks p.i.), none of the organ samples obtained from the cat infected oronasally with recFECV-S 79 tested positive for FECV by PCR and IHC. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that the strong immune response elicited by the reFECV-S 79 infection eliminated the virus.",

            "text": "The efficient rescue of recFECV and its ability to cause a persistent enteric infection in cats represent a milestone in FCoV biology research because the molecular pathogenesis of FIP can now be studied by direct approaches. Using recFECV as a tool, the role of FECV-FIPV \"discriminatory mutations\" in the emergence of FIPVs can be directly evaluated. For example, previously proposed \"discriminatory mutations\" in the S protein, such as M1058L, S1060A, I1108T, and D1108Y (26) (27) (28) , as well as a nonfunctional furin cleavage site (29) can be introduced into the recFECV S gene and possible effects on the pathogenicity of the resulting recombinant viruses analyzed in vivo. Also, using the technology established in this study, an FECV-FIPV \"virus pair\" obtained from a cat suffering from FIP will serve as a basis to construct a set of chimeric serotype I field viruses to identify the genes and mutations that determine an FIPV biotype. To do this, infectious clones of an FECV and the corresponding FIPV have to be produced. Systematic exchanges of genome segments from FECV with matching genome segments from FIPV will allow the mapping of the genetic changes required for turning an FECV biotype into an FIPV biotype. Obviously, the protocols developed in this study may also be useful to develop reverse genetics systems for other RNA viruses with large genomes (such as other coronaviruses and nidoviruses) for which suitable cell culture systems are not available.",
