            "text": "The contribution of distinct central nervous system (CNS) resident cells to protective alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) function following viral infections is poorly understood. Based on numerous immune regulatory functions of astrocytes, we evaluated the contribution of astrocyte IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling toward protection against the nonlethal glia-and neuronotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59. Analysis of gene expression associated with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 function, e.g., pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), revealed lower basal mRNA levels in brain-derived astrocytes than in microglia. Although astrocytes poorly induced Ifn\u2424 mRNA following infection, they upregulated various mRNAs in the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway to a higher extent than microglia, supporting effective IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responsiveness. Ablation of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (IFNAR) in astrocytes using mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice resulted in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality, coincident with uncontrolled virus replication. Further, virus spread was not restricted to astrocytes but also affected microglia and neurons, despite increased and sustained Ifn\u2423/\u2424 and ISG mRNA levels within the CNS. IFN-\u2425, a crucial mediator for MHV control, was not impaired in infected mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice despite reduced T cell CNS infiltration. Unexpectedly however, poor induction of IFN-\u2425-dependent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on microglia supported that defective IFN-\u2425 signaling contributes to uncontrolled virus replication. A link between sustained elevated IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and impaired responsiveness to IFN-\u2425 supports the novel concept that temporally limited early IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses are critical for effective antiviral IFN-\u2425 function. Overall, our results imply that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling in astrocytes is not only critical in limiting early CNS viral spread but also promotes protective antiviral IFN-\u2425 function.",

ISG expression is associated with numerous biological activities, including antiviral and immunomodulatory pathways, e.g., interference with translation, apoptosis, and enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (Ag) presentation (2) (3) (4) . While the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response is critical in stemming CNS viral replication and spread, it is rapidly downregulated and insufficient to eliminate virus in the absence of subsequent adaptive immune responses (5) (6) (7) .

            "text": "Detection of viruses and induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 are initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which differ in subcellular localization and are specialized to recognize distinct molecular entities in virus structural components, genome, and/or replication intermediates (2, 8, 9) . PRRs which recognize RNA viruses include endosome-associated membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mainly TLR3, and the cytoplasmic retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and melanoma differentiationassociated antigen 5 (MDA5). Specialized PRR adapter proteins transmit signals to activate IFN response factor 3 (IRF3), IRF5, and IRF7, which translocate to the nucleus to induce IFN-\u2424 and a subset of IFN-\u2423 genes (9) . Secretion of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and signaling through IFNAR subsequently activate ISGs and the \"antiviral state.\" PRR activation also activates nuclear factor B (NF-B)-regulated genes, thereby inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to facilitate recruitment of innate and adaptive effector cells (2, 9) . Virtually all nucleated cells are able to induce and respond to IFN-\u2423/\u2424, including CNS resident cells (5, 6) . The CNS does not harbor plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are potent peripheral IFN-\u2423/\u2424 inducers (3, 10) , and therefore has to rely on intrinsic induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424. CNS resident cells have been shown to differ widely in the repertoire as well as magnitude of basal and inducible transcripts encoding PRRs and factors associated with the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway (5) (6) (7) 11) . As IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling can rapidly induce genes involved in virus sensing and their signaling components, cell types which are not effective initial IFN-\u2423/\u2424 inducers may nevertheless contribute to the overall innate antiviral activity by efficient IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling and amplification of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response (5, 11, 12) . The interdependence of CNS cells in achieving an IFN-\u2423/\u2424-dependent antiviral state thus requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Microglia and astrocytes are the CNS resident cells most prominently involved in early innate responses to injury, autoimmune attack, or infection (6, 7, 11, 12) . In infections these early responses are essential to attract peripheral immune cells and limit viral dissemination (2, 3, 8) . Importantly, not only productively infected but also abortively infected astrocytes mount innate responses that contribute to protection (3, 13, 14) . CNS infections by several neuronotropic RNA viruses, including La Crosse virus, rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), suggested that astrocytes, not neurons, are the main source of IFN-\u2424 expression and contributors to virus control through both TLR and RLR activation pathways (14) (15) (16) . Both microglia and astrocytes express various PRRs, and their sentinel function is supported by their rapid response to microbial infection (5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18) . In addition to participating in direct antiviral functions, astrocytes regulate CNS homeostasis, support neuronal function, and participate in formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (19, 20) . Both astrocytes and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 actively participate in BBB function to restrict CNS entry of molecules, cells, or pathogens (19, 21) . IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling specifically to astrocytes promotes BBB integrity in the cerebellum and protects from West Nile virus infection (22) . Thus, both astrocyte IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction and signaling regulate the outcome of infection within the CNS at different functional levels. The essential role of IFNAR signaling in limiting viral dissemination within the CNS is supported by neurotropic virus infections of IFNAR-deficient (IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice (3, 5, 6, 23). However, caveats for IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice are the reduced basal levels of factors involved in the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway as well as loss of innate myeloid cell dynamic activity in response to infection (11, 24, 25) . Further, while much information on CNS innate responsiveness is derived from primary glial and neuronal cultures, the in vivo studies of IFN-\u2424 induction highlight how unsuspected players, such as abortively infected astrocytes, contribute to pathogen control (14) .",

            "text": "Based on the prominent role of astrocytes in participating in innate responses, this study set out to assess how IFNAR ablation in astrocytes affects pathogenesis in a gliaand neuronotropic coronavirus infection. The murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 infects microglia, astrocyte, neurons, and oligodendroglia following intracranial (i.c.) administration (26, 27) . Although MHVs are at best poor inducers of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 (28) (29) (30) , they do induce IFN-\u2424 in microglia/macrophages (18) . Importantly, even the low levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 are essential to prevent viral dissemination and mortality (31, 32) . The studies here reveal distinct patterns of basal and inducible levels of mRNAs encoding components of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway in astrocytes and microglia isolated from naive and infected adult mouse brains. Despite expressing lower baseline mRNA levels, astrocytes upregulated IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway gene expression to a greater extent than microglia, supporting effective IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses. Ablation of IFN\u2329R in astrocytes using mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice resulted in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality by 7 days postinfection (p.i.). This contrasted with mild clinical symptoms and no fatalities in infected control IFNAR fl/fl mice. Uncontrolled viral spread throughout the CNS parenchyma of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice not only was associated with increased astrocyte infection but also affected neurons and microglia, despite overall elevated and sustained levels of mRNAs for IFN-\u2424 and IFN-\u2423 genes and ISGs. IFN-\u2425, a crucial mediator of MHV control in the CNS, was not impaired, despite reduced T cell CNS infiltration. Unexpectedly however, defective IFN-\u2425 signaling was implicated by impaired induction of IFN-\u2425-dependent MHC class II expression on microglia. Overall our results imply that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling in astrocytes not only is critical in limiting CNS viral spread but also promotes lymphocyte-derived protective antiviral IFN-\u2425 function.",

            "text": "Astrocytes exhibit distinct induction of and responsiveness to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 compared to microglia. Although MHV A59 replicates in glia and neurons, it induces IFN-\u2423/\u2424 only in microglia, not astrocytes, using primary cell cultures (29) . To assess the relative induction of and responsiveness to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 in astrocytes and microglia in vivo, we used infected GFAP-GFP mice to isolate CD45-negative, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive (CD45 \u03ea GFP \u03e9 ) astrocytes and CD45 int CD11b \u03e9 microglia by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) ( Fig. 2A ). Measurement of viral N relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs in either glia population revealed viral replication in both microglia and astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. and a decline by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2B ). While increased viral N mRNA in microglia relative to astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. did not reach statistical significance, overall viral N mRNA levels mirrored those in total brain. The same populations of purified cells were used to measure transcript levels of the Ifn\u2423/\u2424 genes, genes regulating IFN-\u2423/\u2424, signaling and selected antiviral ISGs (Fig. 2C) . In naive mice, constitutive expression of these genes was lower or undetectable in astrocytes compared to microglia. Following infection, Ifn\u2424 mRNA was upregulated by day 3 p.i. in microglia but was not upregulated until day 5 p.i. and was less robust in astrocytes. In contrast, Ifn\u24234 and Ifn\u24235 mRNAs were not significantly upregulated in microglia but were increased prominently in astrocytes by day 5 p.i. Consistent with the decline in viral RNA, Ifn\u2423/\u2424 mRNAs dropped to baseline levels by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C ). Transcripts for components required for IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling showed no significant differences between astrocytes and microglia throughout days 3 to 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C) . While infection mediated a decline in Ifnar1 mRNA relative to basal levels in microglia by day 5 p.i., it did not alter expression levels in astrocytes. Stat1 mRNA levels varied between cell preparations and showed no significant changes throughout infection in either cell type. Irf9 transcripts were not affected by virus infection in microglia but increased modestly in astrocytes. In contrast, individual ISGs were regulated distinctly not only between the glia populations but also within each glia type over time (Fig. 2C) . MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit1 and Ifit2) and 2=,5=-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (Oas2) transcripts (11, 31) . Although Ifit1 mRNA was increased in both populations by day 3 p.i., the relative induction was significantly higher in astrocytes than in microglia at all time points. In contrast, Ifit2 mRNA was induced more prominently in microglia at day 3 p.i., reached similar levels in both cell types at day 5 p.i., and dropped thereafter in both populations. Lastly, Oas2 mRNA showed peak upregulation in microglia by day 3 p.i. and modest induction in astrocytes (Fig. 2C) . Under the assumption that viral mRNA levels reflect similar replication in both glial populations, these data support microglia as superior initiators of IFN-\u2424 production relative to astrocytes following MHV A59 infection in vivo; these findings are consistent with results from primary neonatal cell cultures (18, 29) . Moreover, delayed Ifn\u2424 upregulation in astrocytes suggested that their sensitivity to viral replication is enhanced once viral sensors are elevated via IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling. This notion was supported by delayed, yet more extensive, upregulation of the Ifn\u2423 as well as the Ifit1 and Ifit2 genes compared to that in microglia. ISG upregulation further appeared to be independent of direct changes in Ifnar, Stat1, or Irf9 transcript levels.",

MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3 have all been established as PRRs contributing to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction in MHV-infected microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes (18, 27, 37, 38) . Basal Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 transcript levels were all significantly lower in FACS-purified astrocytes than in microglia (Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, astrocytes rapidly upregulated Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 mRNAs to levels observed in microglia as early as day 3 p.i. (Fig. 3) , when total Ifn\u2423/\u2424 mRNA peaked in the brain (Fig.  1 ). Relative to basal levels, the fold increase in astrocytes exceeded that in microglia. All three PRR transcripts declined by day 7 p.i., reflecting the decline in IFN-\u2423/\u2424. With the exception of mRNA encoding IKK, a kinase involved in both induction and IFNAR signaling, constitutive levels of transcripts for PRR signal transduction factors represented by IRF3 and IRF7 were also lower in astrocytes (Fig. 3) . Expression of the cellular kinase Ikk mRNA was gradually increased in both glial populations over time up to day 7 p.i., with increases more pronounced in microglia (Fig. 3) . Irf3 mRNA expression was decreased in microglia following infection and remained unchanged in astrocytes, contrasting with upregulation of Irf7 mRNA in both cell types between days 3 to 5 p.i. and downregulation thereafter (Fig. 3) . These data are consistent with constitutive IRF3 expression but inducible expression of both IKK and IRF7 following infection or IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment of non-CNS cells (39) . Overall, the data suggest that initial production of IFN-\u2424 in microglia results in upregulation of select ISGs in astrocytes, thereby amplifying IFN-\u2423/\u2424. However, it remains unclear whether astrocytes induce IFN-\u2424 directly via virus-derived PRR activators or via mediators released from necrotic or apoptotic cells in the inflamed CNS environment. Regardless, the results demonstrate that astrocytes are sensitive responders to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and active participants in the IFN-\u2423/\u2424-induced amplification loop.",

To evaluate to what extent the absence of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling in astrocytes predisposes astrocytes over other cell types to enhanced infection, brains from infected mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl and IFNAR fl/fl mice were analyzed for viral N protein in combination with antibodies (Abs) specific for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and microglia/macrophages (IBA1). Characteristic staining and colocalization patterns at day 4 p.i. in wt mice are depicted in Fig. 5A . Microglia and neurons showed prominent perinuclear cytoplasmic N protein localization, with some extension into processes in microglia. In contrast, viral Ag was only occasionally detected in the cytoplasm of astrocytes and was localized mainly proximal to, but not overlapping with, astrocytic processes. In this context it is critical to note that the anti-GFAP Ab used to identify astrocytes stains main stem branches but not the cytoplasm or fine processes of astrocytes and poorly stains gray matter astrocytes (20, 40) , suggesting that viral protein may localize to astrocytic processes poorly detected by anti-GFAP Ab. Total N protein staining revealed an \u03f33-fold-higher positive area in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl than in IFNAR fi/fi mice as determined by pixels per observed field at day 4 p.i.; the difference increased to \u03f340-fold by day 6 p.i., when virus already declined in IFNAR fi/fi mice (Fig. 5B) . Keeping the limitations of GFAP staining in mind, colocalization of viral Ag with GFAP was overall increased at day 6 p.i. Furthermore, when the relative proportion of the dual-positive area within the total viral Ag-positive pixel area was assessed, percentages were similar in both mouse strains at day 4 p.i. but were 2-fold higher in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice than in controls at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 5C ). Viral Ag-positive microglia were also overall increased in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. However, the relative proportion of the dually viral Ag-and IBA1-positive area per total viral Ag-positive area was comparable between groups at both days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 5D) . To evaluate the relative infection of astrocytes versus microglia, we also measured the proportions of viral Ag-positive area relative to GFAP-or IBA1-positive areas. While infection of microglia increased from \u03f320% to \u03f330%, it increased from \u03fd5% to 15% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice between days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 6) . Although infected neurons were increased in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl compared to IFNAR fl/fl mice throughout the brain by day 4 p.i., they declined significantly in both groups by day 6 p.i. Remaining elevated neuronal infection in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. was still particularly evident in lower and distal parts of the brain (pons and medulla) (Fig. 5E) . Analysis of apoptosis to explain the decline in virus-infected neurons indicated and microglia in brain cortex of both mouse groups at day 6 p.i.

While these results likely underestimate the extent of viral infection in astrocytes, they support that the absence of astrocyte IFNAR signaling leads to increased viral dissemination most prominently within astrocytes but also to microglia and neurons.",

We therefore evaluated how the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes modulates expression of select NF-B-dependent chemokines and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) (43, 44) . Transcripts for Cxcl1 and Ccl2, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively, were similar at day 3 p.i. but were significantly upregulated at day 6 p.i.

(Fig. 9 ) further indicated that IFNAR abrogation on astrocytes does not impact proinflammatory cytokine induction. In contrast, Ccl5 mRNA, which is prominently expressed by T cells during MHV infection (46) , was significantly reduced compared to that in IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i.

Consistent with elevated Cxcl1 mRNA, neutrophils in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl brains were increased by \u03f38-fold at day 6 p.i. relative to those in IFNAR fl/fl mice, although numbers in both groups were already reduced compared to those at day 3 p.i.

As both CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential to reduce infectious MHV, with IFN-\u2425 playing a prominent antiviral role (33, 47) , we further assessed if impaired T cell recruitment and IFN-\u2425 production within the CNS is associated with lack of virus control. Indeed, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were reduced in the CNS of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 10C) . However, similar IFN-\u2425 levels (Fig. 10D) , despite reduced T cell numbers, suggested that increased viral replication leads to increased Ag presentation, thereby triggering more or prolonged IFN-\u2425 production by T cells in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice (48, 49) . Impaired access of T cells to the CNS parenchyma was ruled out as an explanation of loss of viral control, as we found no differences in anatomical distribution of CD3 \u03e9 T cells within perivascular and parenchymal sites between the two groups (data not shown). Uncontrolled viral replication in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice despite similar IFN-\u2425 production thus implied that viral replication overwhelms the T cell response or that IFN-\u2425 signaling is impaired.",

Nevertheless, a prominent indicator of IFN-\u2425 signaling in microglia/macrophages is induction of the transcription factor class II transactivator (CIITA), a master regulator of MHC class II expression (51, 52) . Interestingly, Ciita transcripts were barely induced in brains of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, in contrast to robust upregulation in control mice, at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 10E) . Analysis of MHC class II expression on microglia by flow cytometry confirmed that the very modest Ciita mRNA induction impaired IFN-\u2425-dependent MHC class II upregulation. Only \u03f316% of microglia expressed MHC class II in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, compared to \u03f376% in IFNAR fl/fl mice, and the mean fluorescence intensity, reflecting expression levels, per cell was also lower (Fig. 10F) . Other IFN-\u2425-dependent factors include the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 (53, 54) . While CXCL9 expression is inducible mainly by IFN-\u2425, CXCL10 is inducible by IFN-\u2423/\u2424, IFN-\u2425, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (42, 55, 56) . Furthermore, CXCL9 is produced by macrophages/microglia and endothelial cells, but not astrocytes, whereas CXCL10 is induced prominently in astrocytes during inflammation (53, 57) . Assessment of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 mRNAs showed similarly low levels in both groups at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 10G) . However, unlike IFNAR fl/fl mice, mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxcl9 mRNA by day 6 p.i. In contrast, Cxcl10 mRNA levels were elevated by \u03f32.5-fold in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. but did not increase in IFNAR fl/fl mice. Given that mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice do not express IFNAR on astrocytes, Cxcl10 mRNA upregulation is likely driven by IFN-\u2425 and/or TNF. Overall, these results implied that microglia, but not astrocytes, are significantly compromised in IFN-\u2425 responsiveness in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice.",

            "text": "Preexposure to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 modifies IFN-\u2425 responsiveness in myeloid cells. One explanation for the differential responsiveness to IFN-\u2425 in microglia versus astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice is that prolonged IFNAR signaling via elevated and sustained IFN-\u2423/\u2424 expression may skew subsequent IFN-\u2425 responsiveness. This is supported by an antagonistic effect of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 on IFN-\u2425 responses in macrophages following IFN treatment or Listeria infection (58) (59) (60) . We therefore used the viral RNA mimic poly(I\u00b7C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog recognized by TLR3 as well as RIG-I/MDA5, to induce Ifn\u2423/\u2424 mRNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and monitor IFN-\u2425 responsiveness. Previous in vivo data revealed that poly(I\u00b7C) administration into the CNS of mice induced Ifn\u2423/\u2424 mRNA by 4 h, which was sustained out to 12 h (11). BMDM were thus pretreated with poly(I\u00b7C) for 4 or 12 h and subsequently treated with IFN-\u2425 for 18 h. IFN-\u2425-only treatment was included as a positive control. Poly(I\u00b7C) alone did not induce Ciita mRNA at 4 h and induced it only sparsely by 12 h. However, while IFN-\u2425 treatment alone effectively induced Ciita mRNA, it failed to induce Ciita mRNA in cells pretreated with poly(I\u00b7C) for either 4 or 12 h (Fig. 11) . Similarly, poly(I\u00b7C) alone only sparsely induced Cxcl9 mRNA at 4 h compared to induction by IFN-\u2425 treatment alone, and short poly(I\u00b7C) pretreatment suppressed Cxcl9 mRNA induction by IFN-\u2425. Assessment of an inhibitory effect of prolonged poly(I\u00b7C) exposure was preempted by induction of Cxcl9 mRNA levels similar to those with IFN-\u2425. Finally, treatment with poly(I\u00b7C) alone was superior to IFN-\u2425 alone in upregulating Cxcl10 mRNA, with saturation already achieved at 4 h. These results are consistent with poly(I\u00b7C)-mediated upregulation of CXCL10 via IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and TNF and preempted use of Cxcl10 as a target gene to assess suppressive functions on IFN-\u2425 signaling in this experimental setting. Overall, these data indicate that preexposure of macrophages/ microglia to a virus-induced inflammatory milieu including IFN-\u2423/\u2424 has the potential to negatively regulate subsequent IFN-\u2425 signaling. However, the magnitude of IFN-\u2423/\u2424mediated suppression of IFN-\u2425-dependent gene induction depends on other regulatory elements in the respective target gene promoter. These results reveal that the duration and/or level of cell exposure to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 can substantially diminish responsiveness to temporally lagging IFN-\u2425, thereby reducing IFN-\u2425 protective functions.",

Our studies comparing the capacity of adult astrocytes relative to microglia to respond to MHV A59 infection revealed that astrocytes expressed lower basal levels of PRRs and signaling components to induce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and ISGs than microglia, consistent with published gene array data (61) . Nevertheless, despite a delay in response to infection, astrocytes exhibited strong upregulation of PRRs, Ifn\u2423s, and select ISGs, supporting that astrocytes are well positioned to respond to paracrine IFN-\u2423/\u2424 to amplify their innate antiviral response. The critical role of IFNAR signaling in astrocytes to block viral spread was confirmed by rapid virus dissemination throughout the CNS upon abrogation of IFNAR signaling in astro-cytes. Thus, although basal expression levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling components have been shown to determine the responsiveness of cells to insults (11, 62) , our data reveal that cells expressing low basal levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway components can nevertheless trigger a protective innate immune response through paracrine IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling.",

This is clearly demonstrated by elevated and sustained Ifn\u2423/\u2424 as well as select ISG expression despite IFNAR deletion on astrocytes. However, vast dissemination of virus throughout the CNS clearly indicated that IFNAR signaling specifically in astrocytes plays a dominant role in host protection, which could not be compensated by IFNARcompetent glia and neurons. While microglia appeared to exhibit some autocrine action as suggested by less overall infection relative to that in astrocytes, neurons in the brain stem appeared to be most susceptible and vulnerable to infection in the absence of astrocyte IFNAR signaling. Although we cannot exclude that inherently reduced activation of innate viral components in neurons may contribute to their susceptibility, our data indicate that overwhelming infection of IFNAR-deficient astrocytes increases adjacent neuronal infection. West Nile virus infection of neuronal cultures demonstrates that neurons have the capacity to mount innate viral responses via TLR and IRF activations (63, 64) . Moreover, neurons have also been demonstrated to induce IFN-\u2424 following TMEV and La Crosse virus infection in vivo (65) . Nevertheless, these responses were very sparse and focal. In contrast, subsequent studies of La Crosse virus infection in IFN-\u2424 reporter mice showed that apparently noninfected astrocytes and microglia in close proximity to infected neurons were prominent IFN-\u2424-producing cells, while IFN-\u2424 expression by infected neurons was rare (16) . More recent data demonstrate that IFN-\u2424-producing astrocytes appeared to be transiently or abortively infected during various infections associated with neuronal tropism (14) . The spatial extent of innate protection induced in an infected environment may thus depend on the prominent infected cell type. As both microglia and astrocytes have far-reaching processes, release of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 from these cells may provide more extensive protection than release from neuronal cell bodies. Two independent studies with VSV indeed indicate that locally induced IFN-\u2424 in the olfactory bulb can trigger ISGs in distal parts of the brain, although one indicates astrocytes and the other neurons as the prominent IFN-\u2424 inducers (15, 66) . Regardless, the vast increase of virus in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice supports the notion that the inability of astrocytes to clear virus, rather than loss of direct ISG effects on other CNS cells, is responsible for loss of viral control.",

            "text": "Finally, our results show that extensive virus spread in the absence of protective astrocyte IFNAR signaling cannot be controlled by T cells. Although previous studies of CXCL9 and CXCL10 monoclonal antibody (MAb) blockade to reduce CXCR3-dependent T cell recruitment showed a reduction in T cell migration and loss of viral control in a related MHV infection (75, 76) , subsequent studies in CXCL9-and CXCL10-deficient mice indicated that CXCL10 is more critical for effective adaptive immunity (57) . Impaired T cell accumulation despite unimpaired Cxcl10 mRNA in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice was thus unanticipated. While an overwhelming virus load may lead to Aginduced T cell exhaustion and death (77) , dysregulation of T cells requires future investigation. Regardless of reduced T cell numbers, their initial activity as monitored by IFN-\u2425 secretion was not impaired. IFN-\u2425 signaling is essential for MHV control within the CNS by both exerting direct antiviral effects and enhancing MHC class I and II upregulation (78) . However, reduced induction of IFN-\u2425-dependent Ciita and Cxcl9 mRNAs showed that microglia were significantly impaired in IFN-\u2425 responsiveness. In contrast, increased Cxcl10 mRNA expression in the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes implied that IFN-\u2425 signaling in astrocytes remained intact. The notion that elevated and sustained IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling acts as a negative regulator of IFN-\u2425 signaling was supported by earlier reports showing antagonistic effects of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 on IFN-\u2425-induced activation of macrophages (58-60). One possible mechanism may involve downregulation of the IFN-\u2425 receptor (IFNGR), as shown during Listeria infection (58) . Our in vitro studies further supported selected downregulation of IFN-\u2425 responsiveness by IFN-\u2423/\u2424 via pretreatment of BMDM with the dsRNA mimic poly(I\u00b7C). IFN-\u2423/\u2424-dependent sensitization of microglia/macrophages to subsequent IFN-\u2425 responses may provide a mechanism to limit excessive immune responses leading to tissue damage. In this context it is of interest to note that both IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and IFN-\u2425 responses are tightly controlled by negative regulators, including phosphatases (79) . Cross talk between IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and IFN-\u2425 responses may thus provide additional levels to protect the host from exacerbated proinflammatory responses.",
