Knowledge regarding their occurrence and worldwide transmission is important to control outbreaks and prevent epidemics. Here, we performed shotgun sequencing of toilet waste from 18 international airplanes arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark, from nine cities in three world regions. An average of 18.6 Gb (14.8 to 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated, cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases for bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes with genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes as the most abundant in all samples. We found significantly higher abundance and diversity of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, including critical important resistance (e.g. bla CTX-M ) carried on airplanes from South Asia compared to North America. Presence of Salmonella enterica and norovirus were also detected in higher amounts from South Asia, whereas Clostridium difficile was most abundant in samples from North America. Our study provides a first step towards a potential novel strategy for global surveillance enabling simultaneous detection of multiple human health threatening genetic elements, infectious agents and resistance genes.",

In addition to the direct severe consequences for human health, infectious diseases may cause an increased financial burden on health systems and may imply restriction on travel, trade, etc. Global spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens is another major threat against human health, yet we don't know much about how these genes travel and spread worldwide 6 .",

The technology is applicable for complete sequencing of entire microbial communities 15 and directly on clinical samples 16 . It has also been argued that the technology might have major implications for especially developing countries where NGS as a one-fits-all tool could enable these countries to avoid the establishment of more complex diagnostic methods as those already established in developed countries 14 . NGS combined with novel hot-spot sampling points could potentially provide simultaneous diagnosis of all known pathogens and resistance genes. As international airplane flights are known to be a major route of transmission for infectious diseases 17 , airports have previously been suggested as potential control points for limiting the spread of disease outbreaks 18 . In the past airline travel has been restricted to a narrow demographic. Due to dramatic improvements in cost, availability, logistics and airline networks, this is no longer the case, and airline travel is expanding rapidly to all segments of society and to regions previously considered remote. Clearly there are still biases in the population representation in airline traffic, however it is strategic to implement antimicrobial surveillance with modes of transport since they represent transmission of antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases, and air travel is an important avenue to address, for which surveillance protocols are currently weak or non-existent. In 2012 approximately 1.11 billion passengers travelled on an international flight; a number expected to increase beyond 1.45 billion in 2016 19 . Thus, airports offer a potentially optimal site for global surveillance.",

Strangely enough studies into the changes of the gut composition during travel are scarce, even though it has been indicated that major changes in both the gut composition and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance may occur 27 and that foreign travel is a major risk factor for acquisition of selected resistance genes 28 .

Here we showed the feasibility of collecting and analysing long-distance airplane toilet waste for determining the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance genes and selected human pathogens. In addition to insight into the global macro-transmission of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance, this may also open a novel avenue for simultaneous global surveillance of all infectious agents and quantification of transmission into different countries. Rather than the current surveillance approach where pathogen specific networks are established at laboratories in a limited number of countries, it might be more rapid and cost-efficient with sampling and analysis of the human waste that is transmitted around the World. Such a system is also flexible towards identifying and sampling putative hot-spots and will make it is easier to obtain samples from a new area. A number of obstacles do however, need to be overcome to make this happen. Thus, in order to provide data for action it would be necessary with large scale sequencing facilities close to the sampling site, as well as a global database for real-time exchange of data. The current study included only 18 samples and it would even with the current technologies be a challenge to sequence samples from hundreds of flights on a weekly basis. In addition, more studies are needed to determine how representative the results are of the country of origin. In general airline travel is expanding rapidly and the demographic is not as biased at present compared to years ago. A growing group of people is travelling and they can of-course act as carriers of diseases and antimicrobial resistance genes around the World.",

At the sites of origin toilets were emptied, rinsed with water and disinfected prior to departure. Idu-Flight was used as disinfection agent, which is a deodorizing liquid, based on glutaraldehyde and benzalkoniumchloride. On arrival to Copenhagen the air flight waste containers were emptied by the SAS Cleaning and Service. For our purpose, one car was designated to empty the airplane waste containers, which were toughly rinsed with water prior to collecting samples. From each of the individual airplanes 6-8 waste toilets were emptied under high vacuum pressure into the special container at the service car. This procedure mixes the content thoroughly and no individual fecal clumps or toilet paper can be visually identified. Three individual \u00bd L samples where then collected using sterile tubes from the cars waste container and placed in a refrigerator. Subsequently, a container was rinsed with water before collecting toilet waste from another airplane. Between one and seven flights were collected during a maximum of 12 hours and immediately transported in closed containers for hazardous goods to the Technical University of Denmark and processed immediately.",

E6070L). Libraries were prepared according to manufacturer's directions with slight modifications as follows: Following end repair with incubation of 20 minutes at 12 \u00b0C followed by 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C the samples were purified on a Qiagen Minelute silica spin-column following manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was ligated to Illumina blunt-end adapters as described by Meyer et al. 39 , for 20 minutes at 20 \u00b0C and again purified on a Qiagen qiaquick silica spin-column following manufacturers instructions. Subsequently, the fill-in procedure was performed for 20 minutes at 65 \u00b0C followed by a heat inactivation step for 20 minutes at 80 \u00b0C. Libraries were then used directly for post-library indexing PCR with unique indexing for each sample 31 . Indexing PCR was done in 100 \u03bc L reactions using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 10 \u03bc L template DNA library under the following conditions: 1) 30 seconds at 98 \u00b0C, 2) 20 seconds at 98 \u00b0C, 3) at 30 seconds at 60 \u00b0C, 4) 30 seconds at 72 \u00b0C, 5) 5 minutes at 72 \u00b0C, 6) hold at 4 \u00b0C. Step 2-4 was repeated for 4 cycles. Subsequently, the PCR products were cleaned with Qiagen qiaquick spin columns. Concentrations were measured on a Qubit fluorometer 2.0 (Life Technologies) using the dsDNA HS assay and subsequently analyzed on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies). All 18 samples were pooled into one pool in equimolar concentrations for a final concentration of 9 nM.

Paired end read data was processed by mapping airtoilet fastq samples against several reference sequence databases, which can be downloaded as described in Table S2 . Initially, trimming and removal of adaptor sequences was done using cutadapt 40 with settings for minimum read length being 30 bp and a minimum Phred quality score of 30, to trim low-quality reads before adaptor removal (cutadapt parameter -quality-cutoff). Subsequently reads were processed through a mapping approach build on bwa mem 41 and samtools 42 software. Bwa mem (ver. 0.7.7-r441) was used with default settings to map reads against reference sequence databases. Throughout the mapping approach, only the most reliable hits were accepted i.e. properly paired reads were accepted provided that each read maps with an alignment length being at least 80% of the read length. As part of the initial cleaning process, potential PhiX i.e. PhiX174 control reads were removed using the procedure described above and all remaining reads are likely to have a biological origin. The read statistics for the pre-processing steps are shown in Table S1 for each of the 18 samples available. Next, reads were mapped to a number of reference sequence databases following one of two possible routes, being either chainmode or fullmode mapping. A flowchart of the two mapping procedures is shown in Figure S4 . All samples were mapped against the databases that can be created from public available reference sequences. In Fullmode a resistance gene database (ResFinder) was used. In Chainmode the follow ordered list of databases were used: MetaHitAssembly, Bacteria, Plasmid, Human, Invertebrates, Protozoa and Virus. Reads that mapped to the Bacteria database were subsequently used to extract hits of pathogen specific origin. Three pathogens with the highest read counts were considered as shown in Table S6 (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104, Clostridium difficile R20291, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni IA3902). In this table we only show the most confidently mapped reads and referee to them as unique meaning those where the bwa flags ' AS' and 'XS' differ. The flag ' AS' is the alignment score and 'XS' is the score for the second best alignment.",

The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 G for 30 min to precipitate as much non-viral material, such as toilet paper, tissue and bacteria, as possible and the recovered supernatant were adjusted to pH 7.5 using HCL. Viruses were then precipitated from the supernatant by incubation with polyethylene glycol 8000 (80 g/L) and NaCl (17.5 g/L NaCl) during agitation (350 rpm) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Pellet was resuspended in 0.75 ml PBS and the suspension was clarified by chloroform/butanol extraction (1:1 vol/vol), during which the mixture was vortexed for 30 sec followed by 5 min storage at room temperature before centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 G for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Nucleic acids were extracted from the remaining water phase using BioMerieux reagents and miniMag apparatus (BioMerieux, Herlev, Denmark) according to the protocol of the manufacturer except for eluting the nucleic acids in 100 \u03bc l elution buffer. One-step real-time RT-PCR for the detection of NoV genogroup I and II in 2.5 \u03bc l extracted RNA was carried out as described elsewhere 43 using a StepOnePlus \u2122 System real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies Europe BV, Naerum, Denmark). Quantification of NoV GI and GII genome copies was done by interpolation to standard curves derived from NoV GI.3b and GII.1 RNA transcripts. Inhibition of amplification during RT-PCR detection of NoV GI and GII was evaluated by adding GI.3b and GII.1 transcripts, respectively, as internal amplification controls to each sample RNA extract and to nucleic acid-free water. The amplification efficiency was calculated by dividing the RNA transcripts recovered from the sample RNA by the RNA transcripts recovered from the nucleic acid-free water and was accepted for values above 50%. The extraction efficiency of viral nucleic acid was evaluated in all samples using Mengovirus, strain vMC 0 (ATCC VR-1597) as internal process control. Prior to extraction, approximately 1 \u00d7 10 4 plaque forming units of MC 0 were spiked into the samples and nucleic acid-free water. After extraction, the levels of MC 0 were determined by realtime RT-PCR 43, 44 . The extraction efficiency was calculated by dividing the MC 0 RNA recovered from the abbatoir matrix by the MC 0 RNA recovered from the nucleic acid-free water and was accepted for values above 1%. The extraction efficiency was only used to evaluate the method performance and not incorporated into the calculation of virus concentration in the air flight samples.
