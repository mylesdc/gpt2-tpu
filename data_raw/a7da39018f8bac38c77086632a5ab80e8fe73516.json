Specific concerns are related to false negativity due to probe binding failure. One option for compensating for such deficiency is to integrate a second identically labelled probe in the assay. However, how this alteration influences the reaction parameters has not been comprehensively demonstrated. In the present study, we evaluate a TaqMan protocol using two identically labelled hydrolysis probes (simple, LNA (locked-nucleic-acid)) and MGB (minor-groove-binder) modified probes and combinations thereof in a single assay. Our results based on a synthetic amplicon suggest that the second probe does not compromise the TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR parameters, which repeatedly and reproducibly remained comparable to those of the corresponding single-probe assays, irrespective of the relative probe orientation, whether opposite or tandem, and probe modifications or combinations thereof. On the other hand, the second probe additively contributed to the overall fluorescence signal. The utility of the dual-probe approach was demonstrated on practical examples by using field specimens. We hope that the present study might serve as a theoretical basis for the development or improvement of TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR assays for the detection of highly variable nucleic acid templates.",

The probe is a short, sequence specific oligonucleotide, which binds within the region delimited by the primers. One end, usually the 5\u2032 terminus, of the probe is labelled using a fluorescent dye, while the other one, the 3\u2032 end, is tagged with a quencher. The fluorescent dye and the quencher form a donor-acceptor FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair 2 . As the amplification proceeds, the TaqMan probe hybridizes to the target sequence downstream of one of the primers. These two oligonucleotides form an effective unit. Once the upstream primer begins to be extended, the Taq polymerase mediated 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 hydrolysis of the probe takes place, leading to the disruption of the FRET pair accompanied by dye release from the quenching effect.

The parsing of the reaction mechanism in more detail suggests that, in addition to effective pair-mediated signal generation, the second primer-induced opposite strand synthesis runs in parallel. Since this process is not captured by fluorescence imaging, the opposite strand remains invisible. Hence, the signal observed during the TaqMan qPCR is generated in fact upon only 50% of the accumulated amplicon strands. Visualization of the \"invisible\" amplicon fraction by coupling the second primer with a hydrolysis probe, or more generally by including more distinct probes amidst the forward and reverse primers, could therefore significantly reduce the probability of probe binding failure and improve the inclusivity of a given assay.",

The dilution curves showed a parallel course for the particular dual-probe and the corresponding single-probe subsets in the early exponential phase of amplification. This resulted in highly similar Cq values, supported by low standard deviation (SD) across the entire dilution gradient, irrespective of the combination of the hydrolysis probe modifications or the tested orientations thereof. The close Cq values were also reflected in the parallel and overlapping calibration curves, where the corresponding assays had comparable amplification efficiencies (Fig. 4 , Panels a-c and Supplementary Information 1, Calibration (a-c) curves of the simple-simple, simple-MGB and simple-LNA dual-probe assays in opposite orientations.

Specifically, we did not find as significant improvement in Cq and efficiency values of the dual-probe assays across our data set as reported by Yip and colleagues 15 . However, the theory of qPCR does not suggest significant improvements in these parameters either. In tandem orientations, the two probes bind to one of the DNA template strands. Assuming that the tandem-probe and the corresponding single-probe assays exhibit comparable efficiencies, the recognised template amount in each cycle is identical, i.e. 50%, since in both cases the probe binding and hydrolysis take place upon a single strand of a double-strand template. Hence, all the assays would have identical Cq values and the differences would only be reflected in the higher fluorescence yield of the tandem-probe assays. On the contrary, a dual-probe assay with opposite probe configuration simultaneously detects both strands of the template during each single cycle. Indeed, there is a 2-fold difference between the opposite and tandem-probe assays, which would theoretically yield lower Cq values. Nevertheless, the theory further suggests that if a qPCR is 100% efficient, the 2-fold measurements differ by one cycle between the means 24 . However, in reality, the amplification efficiency is never absolute, and therefore, the expected one cycle difference between the 2-fold dilutions is reduced. In addition, it is burdened with higher experimental variations 25 . Hence, the Cq improving-effect of the second probe in opposite orientation is difficult to distinguish. In summary, there is no obvious theoretical explanation for the observed contradictions. Instead, it seems that the Cq and reaction efficiency improvements observed by Yip and colleagues 15 resulted from sequence mismatches in the first probe and the compensatory effect of the second one. This option was not further investigated.",

In agreement with Yip and colleagues 15 , the second identically labelled probe had an additive effect on the overall reaction fluorescence, which increased it by up to 60% in comparison with the single-probe assays. This represents a significant improvement which facilitates the evaluation and interpretation of weak positive specimens. Further, identically labelled FAM probes enable pre-existing internal controls to be used without the necessity of re-labelling.

To meet this requirement, the primers and the probes have to be selected at the most conserved regions of the targeted genome. Optionally, evolutionarily conserved regions are identified by multiple sequence alignment (MSA), including sequences from a broad time period and from different geographic regions and host species. However, the more diverse the sequence collection of the MSA, the less abundant the conserved positions are. So, once the primers have been selected, the MSA may not provide additional evolutionarily conserved positions suitable for probe selection. The advancement of the dual-probe TaqMan strategy is to enable probe selection at semi-conserved motifs, where the two probes may complement or overlap one another in sequence inclusivity. This might facilitate the development of novel screening assays. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that the opposite dual-probe system is inherently predisposed towards lower Cq values and should be the preferred choice during assay design.",

            "text": "Despite the indisputable advantages, the dual-probe TaqMan technique has several drawbacks. Primarily, the second probe introduces an additional level of complexity into the assay. Therefore, the dual-probe assay requires more comprehensive optimization, evaluation and validation than a single-probe TaqMan assay. Attention should mainly be paid to the generation of nonspecific fluorescent signals, which should be tested on a panel of negative specimens, as well as non-template controls. Further, when one of the probes is knocked out, it cannot be distinguished at first glance which one was influenced. The probe failure is reflected only in the drop of the overall signal intensity of the assay. This requires more attention during the interpretation of the results. Additional disadvantages are the increased reaction cost and possibly an extra pipetting step during the master mix preparation. However, in spite of the negative aspects mentioned above, we are firmly convinced that the dual-probe strategy using identically labelled probes may serve as a valuable option in the development or improvement of a TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR assay for the detection of highly variable nucleic acid templates.
