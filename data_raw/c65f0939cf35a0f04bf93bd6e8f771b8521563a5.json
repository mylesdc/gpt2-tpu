Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.",

Understanding the risk factors underlying the transmission dynamics of that epidemic and evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures are essential to minimise the scale and cost of any future outbreak. Epidemic modelling [3, 4, [5] [6] [7] proved critical to decision making about control policies which were (in some cases controversially) adopted to control the 2001 epidemic [8] [9] [10] .

[4] used maximum likelihood methods to fit to the observed incidence time series, but did not attempt to fit to the spatio-temporal pattern of spread. In their later work, the same authors developed a more robust method for estimating species-specific susceptibility and infectiousness parameters and spatial kernel parameters (see Supplementary Information to [3] ), but at the time the statistical basis for the methods developed was lacking. In retrospect, the methods developed turned out to be closely related to those developed during the SARS epidemic by Wallinga and Teunis [11] , although the earlier work incorporated population denominator data to allow for spatial-and species-based heterogeneity in disease transmission. Nevertheless, the methods employed had the limitation of not being fully parametric, meaning they could not be extended to fit arbitrary transmission models to the observed data. Keeling et al. [5] used maximum likelihood methods to estimate transmission parameters, but it was also supplemented by more ad hoc least-squares matching to regional incidence time series.",

The mixing matrix embedded in (2) quantifies the 4 species-specific mixing rates between animals on different farms: cattle-to-cattle (S c I c ) sheep-to-cattle (S c I s ), cattle-to-sheep (S s I c ) and sheep-to-sheep (S s I s ).

However, allowing infectivity to vary continuously in time results in an over-specified model and problems of parameter identification and confounding. We therefore examined two sets of models in which changes in transmission parameter were restricted to 2 significant points in time denoted by T cut , namely 23 rd February (when the national ban on animal movements was introduced) and 31 st March (when control measures were intensified and the so called 24/48 hour IP/CP culling policy was introduced). Models were respectively fitted to the individual case data from the start of the epidemic (conditioning on the first infection) or from after 23rd February (conditioning on the 54 farms that were already infected by that date). A detailed history of the epidemic is given by Kao [9] . We separately fitted model variants which assumed a discrete change in parameters on 23 rd February and on 31 st March. Confounding meant that only a very limited number of parameters could be varied in time, so we examined the effect of varying infectiousness and kernel parameters separately. We fitted four separate time-varying model variants: (i) varying the cattle infectivity by a factor and keeping sheep infectivity constant through time (Cattle Infectivity model); (ii) varying sheep infectivity by a factor but not cattle infectivity (Sheep Infectivity model); (iii) varying both cattle and sheep infectivity by the same ratio (Cattle & Sheep Infectivity model); (iv) varying the kernel parameters (Time Varying Kernel model). For the last model variant we also fitted a version which includes non-assortative mixing between species (see equation (8)).

This is encouraging for the inference procedure, as the main control measure initiated on that date was the banning of (Figure 3a and Figure 3b ). The parameter estimates are less precise before 23 rd February (Table 1) due to the relatively small number of IPs (about 57) before that date. Looking at the most complex model (namely the interaction model with time varying kernel), cattle were estimated to be 5.7fold (4.6, 6.8) more susceptible than sheep (see Figure 3c and Table 1 ). Rather than mentioning animals' specific infectivity (see Figure 3d and Table 1 ), it is more informative to comment on the cattle:sheep infectivity ratio parameter for the most complex fit (this ratio does dot appear in the tables as it is not a model parameter).

Also, at this stage, the calculations are made as if culling was a non-informative censoring process. This is a reasonable assumption for all proactively culled farms except for DCs (which by definition had been identified by veterinarian as having had a high risk of exposure) but our method may underestimate the infection rate. In calculating the infection to report delay distributions, we divided the epidemic after 23 rd February into 3 time periods: 23 rd February-31 st March, 31 st March-1 st May and 1 st May-5 th October. In these intervals a total of 1332, 4498 and 1627 farms were slaughtered, respectively. Our best fit model conditioned on 23 rd February predicts different infectivity regimes before and after 31 st March (see Parameter Estimates and Table 2 ) but we split further the second period of time due to different delays in reporting to culling. The infection to report delay is 8.6 and 8.8 days for the last two periods of time respectively but the infection to cull delay drops from 9.4 and 8.8 days respectively. Applying this approach to the interaction model with time varying cattle infectivity which conditioned on the 23 rd of February, we calculated the expected proportion of proactively culled farms which were infected. We estimate that approximately 1.3% (1%, 1.6%) of 7457 culled non-IP farms may have been infected -97 in total (Figure 6a ). Of the 1332 farms culled between 23 rd February and 31 st March, 1.7% (1%, 2.4%) may have been infected (23 farms). Of the 4498 farms culled between 31 st March and 1 st May, we estimate 0.7% (0.5%, 1%) were infected (34 farms).

Interestingly, however, it is the kernel parameter estimates which are altered as the latent period is varied with the kernel becoming slightly less local with increasing latent period.

Qualitatively, the results agree with those obtained by Keeling et al. [5] in identifying cattle as being the key species in the 2001 epidemic. Using the interaction model conditioned on 23 rd February with time varying cattle infectivity, we estimated that 88% of IPs between 23 rd Feb-31 st March were infected by cattle and only 12% by sheep. Sheep-to-sheep transmission only accounts for 3.1% of IPs in that period. After 31 st March (when we estimated that cattle infectivity increased slightly, see Table 2 ) Allowing for non-random mixing between species indicates contacts between farms are assortative on the basis of species composition of the farm; i.e. like species mix with like. This agrees with intuition about the nature of farming practices (e.g. sharing of personnel and equipment is likely to be more common if 2 farms have the same livestock species). The implications of the moderate degree of assortativity we found for control measures remains to be explored.",

Also we shared the concern of earlier work that the distribution of contact distances in traced contacts may well be biased [3] . We therefore estimated the kernel function, using an offset power-law functional form. The higher value of the kernel power parameter we estimated after 23 rd February (2.67 vs. 1.70 before - Figure 3a) is consistent with the expected dramatic shortening in the typical contact distance following the national movement ban. This localized spread together with the higher estimated level of infectivity in cattle after 31 st March explains the long tail of the epidemic seen in 2001.",

However, the discrepancy may also reflect model inadequacy. We have not here allowed for other farm-level risk factors, such as the farm fragmentation index considered by Ferguson et al. [3] . We have not explored more complex non-linear models of the dependence of susceptibility and infectiousness on the number of animals on a farm or relaxed our implicit assumption that contact rates between farms scale linearly with the local density of farms.

The very low numbers of proactively culled farms we estimated as infected suggested that the effect of this model refinement may be limited. It should be noted though that these infection prevalence estimates are in part a result of the relatively non-local kernel estimated simultaneously. If kernel estimates change in a refined analysis -and if DCs were attributed a much higher risk of infection than estimated here due to their status -then it is possible that estimated infection rates in DCs and other proactively culled farms may increase somewhat.",
