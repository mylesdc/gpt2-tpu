            "text": "Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees (''who infected whom'') from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.",

            "text": "Statistical methods for analyzing detailed epidemiological data collected during infectious disease outbreaks have seen rapid development in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . These methods probabilistically reconstruct likely transmission links between cases using data on the timing of symptoms and, where available, contact tracing data or other proximity information. The resulting transmission trees allow estimation of the number of secondary infections generated by each case, and thus of the transmission intensity (characterized by the reproduction number, R) over time. Pathogen genetic sequence data provides valuable additional information on potential transmission links between cases in a disease outbreak, particularly when reliable contact tracing data is not available. Indeed, using sequence data alone to estimate transmission rates during epidemics is increasingly frequent [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . As genetic sequences can now be obtained nearly in real-time [19, 20] , this new source of information opens up exciting perspectives not only for understanding past outbreaks, but also for unraveling the transmission routes of ongoing outbreaks and subsequently adapting public health responses.",

            "text": "Integrated analysis of both epidemiological and sequence data clearly would maximize our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, but there are methodological and computational challenges. These challenges center on constructing and evaluating a unified likelihood for both the genetic and epidemiological data. One of the first attempts at integrated analysis [21] used phylogenetic trees to constrain the set of transmission trees then explored by an epidemiological transmission tree inference algorithm. An alternative approach [22] highlighted limitations of phylogenetic methods for reconstructing densely sampled outbreaks, and proposed an alternative graph theoretic approach for reconstructing 'genetically parsimonious' transmission trees, i.e. trees implying the smallest number of genetic changes amongst the sampled isolates. While simple and fast, this method also has a number of limitations: dates of infection are not inferred, the probability of a given transmission event cannot be assessed, and unobserved cases or multiple introductions of the disease cannot be detected. Substantive methodological developments have been made by Ypma et al. [23] and subsequently by Morelli et al. [24] , both of which proposed unified likelihoods for genetic and epidemiological data to analyze livestock disease outbreaks (avian influenza H7N7 [23] and foot-and-mouth disease [24] ). However, those methods require that the outbreak has a single introduction event and that all cases are observed, which limits their applicability to restricted epidemic contexts.",

We use the distribution of the generation time (i.e. time interval between a primary and a secondary infection) [7, 8] to define the epidemiological likelihood of a given transmission tree. This is coupled with a simple model of sequence evolution defining the probability of the genetic changes observed between the pathogen genomes along a chain of transmission. Our model is embedded within a Bayesian framework allowing estimation of dates of infections, mutation rates, separate introductions of the pathogen, the presence of unobserved cases, and the transmission tree. Estimate of the effective reproduction number over time, R(t), can also be obtained. As an improvement over previous approaches [23, 24] , our method does not require all cases to be observed or there to be a single introduction event which triggers an outbreak.

Better results were achieved when the sampling coverage was high (compare settings 'Base' to 75%, 50% and 25% of missing cases). In the absence of genetic information, the transmission tree was very difficult to infer (setting 'No mutation'). Differences in basic reproduction numbers (settings 'Low R' and 'High R') and in the shape of the generation time distribution (settings 'Short generation' and 'Long generation') induced some variation in the proportions of successfully recovered ancestries, although these remained satisfying in every case ( Fig. 1 and Table S1 in Text S1). Dates of infections were inferred with accuracy in most settings ( Fig. S2 and Table S1 in Text S1). However, this result was mostly driven by the shape of the generation time distribution, with broader distributions leading to greater uncertainty in the dates of infection (Fig. S2 ). While perfectly inferred in fully sampled outbreaks, the number of generations between ancestor and descendents became ambiguous as the proportion of missing cases increases (Table S1 in Text S1). Mutation rates were also mostly well estimated (Table S1 in Text S1, Fig. S3 ), albeit with a tendency to over-estimation. This bias was stronger when sampling grew sparser (settings with 75% and 50% missing cases), and to a lesser extent when the number of imported cases grew large (setting 'Many imports'). Detailed investigation of individual simulations suggested that misdetection of imported cases and increased numbers of erroneous ancestries may be responsible for over-estimating the mutation rates in these settings. The inference of sampling coverage varied largely amongst different simulation settings (Table S1 in Text S1, Fig.  S4 ): well recovered in fully sampled outbreaks, it was largely overestimated in sparse samples (settings with 75%, 50% and 25% missing cases), and slightly underestimated with longer generation time.",

To assess whether our approach could detect such heterogeneity, we implemented two types of simulations in which there were systematic differences in infectivity between groups of hosts. In a first set of simulations, the host population was divided into two groups of equal sizes (e.g. adults and children) with low and high infectivity (infectivity in one group was twice that of the other group, with equal susceptibility). In the second setting, we included rare (5%) super-spreaders, who had the same susceptibility to infections as non super-spreaders, but were 13-fold more infectious. In both sets of simulations, infectivity was fixed for each individual at the beginning of the simulations. The classification of individuals into super-spreaders and regular spreaders was considered as known when comparing estimated reproduction numbers.",

Recently, the reconstruction of transmission trees (''who infected whom'') has been revolutionized by the availability of pathogen genome sequences. Exploiting this information remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. Here, we introduce a new method which uses both pathogen DNA and collection dates to gain insights into transmission events, and detect unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. Our approach is also useful for identifying super-spreaders, i.e., cases which caused many subsequent infections. After testing our method using simulations, we use it to gain new insights into the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Our approach is applicable to a wide range of diseases and available in a free software package called outbreaker.",

Similar results were observed in simulations including superspreaders (Fig. 4 , bottom panel), in which estimates of R values at an individual level were excellent when using genetic information (Fig. S8) , and very poor without it (Fig. S9 ). The reconstruction of average R values over time was not improved by the inclusion of genetic information (Fig. S10 , S11), which is unsurprising as this mainly depends on correctly inferring the dates of infections, which was unaffected by the absence of genetic data (Fig. S1, S2 ).",

According to previous estimates of the mutation rate [25] , we expect that most direct transmissions (. 99%) will exhibit between 0 and 5 mutations. Using this result, we performed a simple graph analysis to derive possible clusters of direct transmissions, which suggested the existence of one main cluster of cases that may be linked directly, the remaining 4 isolates falling into three groups (Fig. S15 ). However, this crude analysis only relied on genetic diversity, and did not take into account information on the collection dates of the isolates or on the duration of the infectious period.",

Our method is also the first tool for outbreak reconstruction widely available as a free software (the R package 'outbreaker') and able to run on standard desktop computers. The analysis of simulated data suggests that our approach will be applicable to a wide range of pathogens with various basic reproduction numbers, generation time distributions, and genetic diversity. We have shown how our approach can be used to infer effective reproduction numbers at an individual level. Importantly, this allows for detecting differences in infectivity of different groups of cases, and for the identification of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that while epidemiological data may suffice for the estimation of mean aggregated quantities such as the mean effective reproduction Figure 1 .

We note that our framework could easily be extended to model the uninfected population. This could be done by modifying our likelihood so that the probability of the time of infection of a case would be based on an explicit model of the force of infection; individuals not infected during the outbreak would also contribute to the epidemiological likelihood as is standard in such situations [4] .

While the reconstruction of transmission tree seems relatively robust to large proportions of unobserved cases (up to 75% of missing cases, Fig. 1 ), our method is clearly tailored to densely sampled outbreaks, and not meant for the analysis of large-scale, more sparsely sampled epidemics. In such cases, phylogenetic methods are preferred as they explicitly reconstruct unobserved common ancestors of the sampled pathogen genomes, and can be used to infer, if not the transmission tree, the past dynamics of the disease [30, 31, 32] .",

While this method should be useful to detect separate introductions of different pathogenic lineages in an epidemic, it may be sensitive to other events prone to creating genetic outliers, such as sequencing errors or recombination. Care should therefore be devoted to ensuring data quality and filtering out polymorphism due to recombination. Moreover, the assumption that imported cases are genetically distinguishable from other cases may not always be true, especially when multiple introductions take place from a closely related lineage. Such cases cannot be detected by genetic data only, and would require other sources of information (e.g. contact tracing) to be considered. In this respect, an interesting feature of outbreaker is the ability to fix known imported cases (as well as any other known transmissions) before reconstructing the transmission tree.",

In this case, a conservative approach should allow for a wide range of possible times to infection, at the expense of increased uncertainty in the inferred ancestries. As our method is numerically efficient for the analysis of small outbreaks, we suggest testing different generation time distributions to assess the robustness of the results.

Our model assumes that a single pathogen genome exists within each host, and is therefore not designed to account for multiple infections. A simple workaround would consist in duplicating cases of multiple infections into single infections, assuming that multiple infections are made of independent, single colonization events. However, this would not allow for disentangling multiple infections from mere within-host evolution of a single lineage. A more satisfying approach would consist in modeling explicitly the evolution of isolates within host, but this will likely result in a much more complex model and is beyond the remit of our current approach.",

Within-host diversity is particularly prominent in pathogens that infect a host for a long time relative to their withinhost replication cycle (e.g. HIV or Hepatitis C Virus), pathogens that can be carried for a long time (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), pathogens where the infectious inoculum is large (e.g. bloodtransmitted HIV), or super-infection is frequent (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae in hyper-endemic settings). Limited host diversity leads us to assume that genomes sampled from infectors are effectively ancestral to genomes sampled from secondary cases, allowing us to equate phylogenetic and transmission trees. This substantially reduces the complexity of the inferential problem, and reduces by orders of magnitude the dimensionality of the space of linked augmented variables to be explored. The assumption of no withinhost diversity will likely be appropriate for acute infectious pathogens in outbreaks, but will also be relatively appropriate for situations where there is a strong bottleneck on diversity upon transmission and limited opportunities for superinfection, such as sexually transmitted HIV. Inclusion of within-host diversity in the model inference is an important but likely complex task, though efficient approximations may be possible. A related development will be the inclusion of multiple samples per individual, used to sample cross-sectional and longitudinal genetic diversity within infected hosts. Another somewhat simpler extension would be the inclusion of a 'relaxed' molecular clock, which would allow accounting for heterogeneities in mutation rates amongst different pathogen lineages.",

Because the estimates of parameters governing an outbreak are often correlated, accurate knowledge of one can be used to refine the estimation of the others. For instance, specifying known transmission chains or imported cases will improve the estimation of the mutation rates, as well as the overall reconstruction of the transmission tree. Conversely, fixing the mutation rate to its 'true' value (or a good estimate thereof) is likely to improve the detection of imported cases. As currently implemented, our method allows for fixing any parameter as well as individual ancestries, which are used in the likelihood computations but not changed during the MCMC. This feature should be especially useful for incorporating known transmission events or introductions of the pathogen into the population, based for instance on clinical investigations and contact tracing information. However, results of contact tracing studies should always be considered cautiously, and could be contradicted by the analysis of corresponding sequences, as illustrated by the SARS outbreak in Singapore.",

The function d(s i ,s j ) computes the number of mutations between s i and s j , while l(s i ,s j ) computes the number of nucleotide positions which can be compared between the two sequences. w is the distribution of the generation time, defined as the time interval between the infection of an individual and his seeding of new secondary cases. f is the distribution of the time interval between infection and collection of an isolate. Both w and f are assumed to be known, and are not part of the estimated parameters. Augmented data are used to model the transmission process, which is not observed directly [5, 34] . We denote a i the index of the most recent sampled ancestor of case i, and k i the number of generations separating cases a i and i (k i \u00a71). For imported cases, a i is fixed to 0. The date of infection for case i is denoted T inf i . We use the simplest model of sequence evolution considering one single mutation rate (m), measured per site and per generation of infection. Unlike approaches based on strict molecular clocks (e.g. [24] ), a generational clock models the accumulation of genetic diversity with new infections while overlooking within-host evolution [23] .

The same distribution was used for the the time to collection. Details of the parameters used to run outbreaker are provided in Supporting Methods. The statistical confidence in determining the ancestry of a given case was quantified using the entropy of the frequencies of the posterior ancestors. With K different ancestors of posterior frequencies f k (k~1,:::,K), the entropy is defined as:",

This figure summarizes the reconstruction of the outbreak, showing putative transmissions (arrows) amongst individuals (rows). Arrows represent ancestries with a least 5% of support in the posterior distributions, while boxes correspond to the posterior distributions of the infection dates. Arrows are annotated by number of mutations and posterior support of the ancestries, and colored by numbers of mutations, with lighter shades of grey for larger genetic distances. The actual sequence collection dates are plotted as plain black dots. Bubbles are used to represent the generation time distribution, with larger disks used for greater infectivity. Shades of blue indicate the degree of certainty for inferring the origin of different cases, as measured by the entropy of ancestries (see methods and equation 12): blue represents conclusive identification of the ancestor of the case (low entropy), while grey shades are uncertain (high entropy). doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003457.g005",
