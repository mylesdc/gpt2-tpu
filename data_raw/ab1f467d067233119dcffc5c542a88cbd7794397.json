The resulting data is often quite disparate, stored in separate locations, and not contextually related. Collaborative Molecular Modeling Environment (C-ME) is an interactive community-based collaboration system that allows researchers to organize information, visualize data on a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) basis, and share and manage that information with collaborators in real time. C-ME stores the information in industry-standard databases that are immediately accessible by appropriate permission within the computer network directory service or anonymously across the internet through the C-ME application or through a web browser. The system addresses two important aspects of collaboration: context and information management. C-ME allows a researcher to use a 3-D atomic structure model or a 2-D image as a contextual basis on which to attach and share annotations to specific atoms or molecules or to specific regions of a 2-D image. These annotations provide additional information about the atomic structure or image data that can then be evaluated, amended or added to by other project members.",

            "text": "To address these concerns, ''collaboratory systems'' have been put into operation. Collaboratory systems are often computerbased systems that manage research workflow processes and allow different lab units to communicate and share data. Wulf defined a collaboratory as a ''center without walls, in which the nation's researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, and accessing information in digital libraries'' (Wulf W (1989) ''The national collaboratory.'' Towards a National Collaboratory. Unpublished report of a National Science Foundation invitational workshop, New York: Rockefeller University). Bly refines the definition to ''a system which combines the interests of the scientific community at large with those of the computer science and engineering community to create integrated, tool-oriented computing and communication systems to support scientific collaborations'' [1] . Chin and Lansing state that the research and development of scientific collaboratories has, thus far, been a tool-centric approach [2] . The main goal was to provide tools for shared access and manipulation of specific software systems or scientific instruments. Such an emphasis on tools was necessary in these early development years because of the lack of basic collaboration tools-text chat, synchronous audio, videoconferencing-to support rudimentary levels of communication and interaction. Today, however, such tools are available in off-the-shelf software packages, such as Microsoft LiveMeeting, and IBM Lotus Sametime. The design of collaboratories can move beyond developing general communication mechanisms to evaluating and supporting data sharing in the scientific context. New communication channels can be added to facilitate collaborative exchange of ideas and data. Social network services are an example of a novel communication channel that has attracted large numbers of participants. Services like MySpace and Facebook provide a web site for members with similar interests to interact and share information through a variety of formats, such as, discussion groups, voice and video, file sharing, and email. The success of these services has to be considered within a scientific context to provide an effective on-line environment for scientific collaboration.",

Research teams are increasingly interdisciplinary and collaborative among laboratories in different departments and institutions located around the world, so it is important for them to have the tools to bridge the gaps of specialization, geography, and time. Researchers must employ data organization and workflow management tools to share the context of their data. The ability to quickly search and retrieve complex 3-D data in real time is critical to the efficiency and productivity of large-scale research work. Currently, the insufficient level of detail made available by published literature, both in print and online, makes it challenging for researchers to share their knowledge. For instance, data from large-scale structural genomics initiatives , such as, PSI I & II (US), SGC (Europe), SPINE (Europe), RIKEN (Japan), will require centralized and automated facilities across continents, new methods to divide labor, and novel tools to disseminate and annotate the data to put it into the larger scientific context of systems biology.",

An instructor in a graduate level pathology course, for example, uses C-ME to present students with examples of pathology reports in 2-D image formats. The instructor prepares appropriate annotations ahead of class time, and students reviewing the material after class can add comments or leave questions for the instructor. Additionally, image-based medical specialties can use the features of C-ME for education. In a pathology fellowship training program, where visual microscopic skills are paramount, learning modules for various pathologic diseases are created. This gives trainees the opportunity to practice making diagnoses by looking at microscopic images, as they will in their future daily practice. But unlike in real life, these microscopic images come with embedded annotations, files, PowerPoint presentations and on-line literature reviews, highlighting the corresponding disease information the trainees need to master in association with each image of abnormal cells.
