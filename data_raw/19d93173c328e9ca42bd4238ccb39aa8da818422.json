A negative impact on family income was reported by 33% of all patients at 6 months and 28% at 12 months. There was nearly a 50% reduction in the number of patients who reported employment as their sole source of income at 12 months (19% to 11%) compared with pre-admission. One quarter of patients reported themselves in need of care assistance at 6 months and 22% at 12 months. The majority of care was provided by family members (80% and 78%, respectively), for half of whom there was a negative impact on employment. Amongst all patients receiving care, 26% reported requiring greater than 50 hours a week. Following discharge, 79% of patients reported attending their primary care physician and 44% had seen a community nurse. Mobility problems nearly doubled between pre-admission and 6 months (32% to 64%). Furthermore, 73% reported moderate or severe pain at 12 months and 44% remained significantly anxious or depressed.",

            "text": "Up to two thirds of ICU survivors may experience significant problems with physical and psychological health as well as social functioning [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, there is limited rigorous research into the social and economic impact that a period of critical illness imposes on both the patient and their immediate family and to date there have been limited attempts to estimate the magnitude of this issue. In 1994, Covinsky et al. demonstrated that 34% of seriously ill hospitalized patients required considerable care-giving assistance from a family member in the 12 months following hospital discharge [11] . In 20% of cases, a family member had to leave work and overall a third of families reported a loss of the major source of income. In 2002, Swoboda and colleagues reported the long-term effects on patients' families after a prolonged stay in a surgical ICU [12] . Almost 60% of responding families provided a moderate or large amount of caregiving between 1 and 9 months after hospital discharge. Just under half had to leave work after 1 month, and more than a third of families had lost savings after 1 year; families moved to a less expensive home, delayed educational plans, or delayed medical care for another family member [12] . A Canadian study, which consisted predominantly of previously healthy and relatively young patients (median age of 43) , reported that only 49% had returned to work 1 year after discharge from and ICU, increasing to 73% at 5 years. The reported return to work was mostly driven by economic necessity and difficulties in obtaining state financial support [13] . In the UK, extensive experience of talking with survivors of critical illness and their families [14] , suggests that the socio-economic consequences of critical illness similarly extends beyond the individual to impact upon the health and social care systems. Potentially the incomplete physical and non-physical recovery from a period of critical illness experienced by some has an impact on the resumption of independent living and employment; this situation, plus any consequential requirement for care, may jeopardize their wider family social and economic stability.",

The demographic questions were adapted from a draft of the Office of National Statistics' questionnaire intended for use during the 2011 national census [25] . A potential list of other questions was derived from previous question sets used in the study of chronic conditions that are associated with an established social, economic and caregiver burden [26, 27] . This potential list was reduced to a manageable question set in terms of time to complete, complexity and intrusiveness. The acceptability and face validity of this question set was subsequently assessed by a group of ICU survivors and relatives, who formed part of the UK Intensive Care Society Patient and Relatives Group, as well as a selection of experienced ICU clinical staff.",

A negative impact on employment was reported by 33% of all patients at 6 months and 28% at 12 months. In parallel, critical illness also impacted on reported family earning source and income. Excluding those patients who were retired prior to ICU admission, there was a demonstrable reduction in reported income from wages or self-employment at 6 months ( Figure 2 ). This reduction predominately occurred in those patients who reported employment as their sole source of income prior to admission; any loss of employment at 6 months largely continued at 12 months and was accompanied by an overall increase in the proportion of patients receiving state financial support. Interestingly, the sum total of individual patients claiming state financial support was less at 12 months in comparison with 6 months. This reduction appears to occur amongst the 32% of patients not retired prior to ICU admission who report receiving their income from at least two separate sources. At 12 months after ICU discharge 45% of all patients reported no change in their monthly family income, whilst 32% reported a reduction and 22% an increase.

Swoboda and colleagues [12] reported that almost 60% of responding families provided a moderate or large amount of caregiving. In a further study of informal caregiver burden, caregivers reported spending on average nearly 6 hours a day providing assistance [29] . The highest reported need for care comes from a short-term study by Im et al. of patients who had received at least 48 hours ventilation [30] ; 74.8% needed support at 2 months after ICU discharge; the median time spent on providing care was 4 hours/day.",

Our findings concerning changes in employment status for this general ICU population do echo those of the Canadian ARDS cohort, although our population was around 10 years older and thus retirement was more common [13] . Importantly, outcome cohort studies such as this one cannot prove a causal relationship between critical illness or intensive care stay per se and the impact described; effects in individuals may be due to their acute illness or progression of pre-existing disease. Similar effects may possibly be observed in a population of survivors of serious illness who did not spend time in intensive care; future studies should perhaps enroll such populations as comparator groups.",

A significant proportion of those who do return to work do not return to their preexisting level of income or workload commitment. The majority of the care required is provided by family members. In addition, the reduction in patients who return to employment at 6 months and the corresponding use of state financial support remains fairly static at 12 months. This suggests that those family members who become informal caregivers make adjustments to their working lives, resulting in a reduction in financial status. More positively, we did not observe patterns of intimate relationship breakdown or loss of original home, but we cannot exclude this being a major issue in other populations or occurring at a later date. We would cautiously conclude that in families who were experiencing the greatest disruption, this effect was apparent by 6 months and had not materially improved by 12 months. This exploratory study has demonstrated a significant socio-economic burden following critical illness. As important are the methodological lessons learnt, which will hopefully guide future research and ultimately intervention studies aimed at improving these important outcomes.",
