In the township of Ve Golokuati in Ghana, several \"camps\" of Epomophorus gambianus roost in fruit trees that provide ecosystems services for residents. This study explored human-bat interaction in the township and the potential risks of disease transmission from bats to humans. Data were derived through questionnaire administration and participatory appraisal approach involving focus group discussions, participatory landscape mapping, and transect walk. The study found that most human activities within the township, such as petty-trading, domestic chores, and children's outdoor recreation, exposed people to bats. Though there have been no reported cases of disease spillover from bats to humans from the perspective of residents and from medical records, respondents whose activities brought them closer to bats within the township were found to be more likely to experience fevers than those who do not interact with bats frequently. The study recommends education of community members about the potential risks involved in human-bat interactions and makes suggestions for reducing the frequent interactions with and exposure to bats by humans.",

In the township of Ve Golokuati, the Afadzato South District capital in the Volta Region of Ghana, several \"camps\" of E. gambianus roost in mango and other fruit trees that provide shade and other ecosystems services for residents. Concerns have been raised about the closeness of bats to humans because of the ability of the former to spread zoonotic diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Viruses isolated from bats include lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and related coronaviruses (SARS-related 2 Journal of Environmental and Public Health have been most widespread in Africa [9] . Ebola outbreaks have been recurring since the first major case in DR Congo in 1995, which affected more than 260 humans and caused 186 deaths, was reported [14] . The most recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 infecting about 27,898 people and causing 11,296 reported deaths [17] raised public apprehension about human-bat interactions. This is because the outbreak has been traced back to a single incident of a young child playing in the vicinity of a hollow tree frequented by bats [18] , now identified as a potential source of spillover of the EBV [11, 14, 19] . The ability of bats to spread zoonotic diseases and the fact they live close to humans heighten the potential threat of disease spillover.",

They are well known for their roles in seed dispersal, pollination, maintaining soil fertility, and aiding in nutrient distribution [6, 20, 21] . Muscarella and Fleming [20] noted that bats facilitate seed dispersal in clear-cut strips as a result of how they defaecate and spit out seeds during flight. They also observed that many fruit bats use one or more feeding roosts each night and tend to deposit the vast majority of seeds ingested far away from fruiting plants. Through this habit, bats help to maintain species diversity by introducing seeds from outside disturbed areas. Bats in general have further been identified as bioindicators through their sensitivity to climate change, environmental degradation, and contamination by agrochemicals and other toxins [22, 23] .",

While some earlier studies indicated that urbanization results in decreases in diversity and abundance of bats [26] , others believe that the prevailing conditions and the patterns of development in the urban periphery encourage bats to concentrate in those areas [25, 27] . Urbanization can thus support bat-related activities and enhance ecosystem services for humans.

They roost low in trees during the day and are not disturbed by the presence of people [30] . Apart from the nuisance created from noise [1] , not much has been documented on how their proximity affects humans and, until recently, this was not considered to be a problem. In addition, there have been no records of any disease spillover from bats to humans in Ghana or in the study area. The Ebola outbreak in parts of West Africa in 2014, as well as its link to bats as a potential source of contagion [31] , has heightened people's concern [18] about bat-human interactions and their sense of risk. Thus better understandings of the cohabitation of humans and wild animals and the potential implications for human well-being are required urgently.",

The town is located in the forest-savannah ecotone dominated by Guinea Savannah Woodlands. However, anthropogenic drivers, notably land conversion through rotational farming, lumbering, fuelwood extraction, and bush burning, have degraded the forest cover considerably. The town has a population of about 6,000 people, dominated by the Ewespeaking ethnic group of the Volta Region. It is a \"nucleated\" settlement with houses built closely together without any clear layout. Apart from the major roads that pass through the town from east to west and north to south (see Figure 1 ), a few streets exist. Houses and compounds are separated by winding footpaths. Residents share facilities such as public places of convenience, water sources, and the open spaces such as recreational fields. Epomophorus gambianus was the most dominant bat species in the study area, but, in a few cases, small numbers of other species such as the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) and Peter's dwarf epauletted bat (Micropteropus pusillus) were observed. The M. pusillus and E. gambianus both occur in the township and are distinguished mainly by their facial looks and size, with M. pusillus being smaller. Also M. pusillus roost mostly in the lower parts of the same trees as E. gambianus. Residents believed that the two species were the same and that the separation was by age, but ecological studies carried out as part of our general studies on bats, which involved capturing of the bats, confirmed that indeed they were two different species. According to the residents, the bats migrated to Ve Golokuati in mid-to-late 1990s. It was, however, not clear where the bats came from. Whereas some believed that the bats migrated from Wli Water Fall area, a Wildlife Sanctuary located about 25 km from Ve Golokuati, others were of the view that the bats came from nearby bushes which were no longer habitable because of disturbances, notably incessant bush fires and agricultural conversion.",

The bats reportedly moved on a daily basis between 5:30 pm and 6:00 pm and again between 4:30 am and 5:00 am. During these times when thousands of bats are in flight, the risk of contaminating water harvesting systems by bat through aerosolization of bat droppings is very high. The focus group discussion further revealed that domestic stock (e.g., sheep, goats, and poultry) also interacted both directly and indirectly with the bats. Most of these animals were sheltered in pens and coops within the households but were allowed to roam in search of food during certain times of the day when they fed on foliage and fruits dropped by bats (also see [36] ). Pets, notably cats and dogs, live within households but are also left to roam about freely within the township to hunt and scavenge for food. The threat of exposure to disease, through human-bat interactions, is reinforced by the predatory behaviour of the pied crow (Corvus albus) which targets the young E. gambianus just as they are being weaned. According the respondents, the crows often left bat carcasses which were often scavenged by dogs. This is noteworthy because, in the event of any disease spillover, transmission via domestic animals cannot be discounted.",

Indeed, the genesis of occurrence of bats in the study area is not very certain, but research has shown that, generally, bats relocate in response to a range of environmental factors [39, 40] . According to Rebelo et al. [41] , climate change has the potential to reduce the suitability of bat roosting sites, particularly tree roosts.

Furthermore, the bats within the township were protected from threats and other disturbances better than in the wild. In a number of locations in Ghana where bats occur, they are under some form of protection for various reasons such as traditional taboos, military presence, or deliberate protection [42] . Human-bat interaction occurs for a number of reasons. Hayman et al. [7] observed that such interaction occurs because humans are encroaching on bats' habitats, just as bats are utilizing human structures as roosts. The interactions may be indirect, in the form of odour from faecal droppings, urine, aerosolization of saliva, and glandular body secretions [43] . It may also be direct through hunting and processing of bat bushmeat for consumption [2, 10] . In Ve Golokuati, the findings showed that human interaction with bats is both direct and indirect, which suggests that the residents may be at risk to disease spillover. The \"host-parasite continuum\" framework [28] , suggests that wildlife, domestic animals, and human populations coexist and that disease spillover occurs within a finely balanced host-agent continuum. The framework highlights the ways in which underlying factors such as agricultural intensification, translocation, and human encroachment are responsible for emerging infectious diseases.",
