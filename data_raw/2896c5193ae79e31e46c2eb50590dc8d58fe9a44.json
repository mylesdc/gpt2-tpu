Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are generally self-limiting but occasionally persistent infections have been described. This study aimed to identify persistent HRV infections and investigate the clinical and virologic characteristics of patients with persistent infections. From January 2012 to March 2015, 3714 respiratory specimens from 2608 patients were tested for respiratory viruses by using a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A retrospective study was performed. Patients with at least two specimens positive for HRV/enterovirus taken 45 days or longer apart were identified and the HRV/enteroviruses were typed. Patients with persistent infection were compared to patients with reinfection and patients with cleared infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral protein(VP)4/VP2 region was performed. 18 patients with persistent HRV/enterovirus infection were identified. Minimum median duration of persistence was 92 days (range 50-455 days). All but one patients with persistence were immunosuppressed. Immunosuppression and hematologic disorders were more frequent in patients with persistence (n = 18) than in patients with reinfection (n = 33) and with cleared infection (n = 25) (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, this retrospective study identified HRV persistence in vivo which occurred mainly in immunosuppressed patients.",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are classified into three species (A, B and C) within the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae [1, 2] . HRVs mainly cause upper respiratory tract infections. However, they can also cause lower respiratory infection and are associated with exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases [3] , such as asthma [4] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [5] and cystic fibrosis [2, 6] . Viral persistence has been described for several Enterovirus species, and it was linked to clinical entities, e.g. persistent infection with poliovirus is associated with post-polio syndrome and persistent infection with Coxsackievirus is associated with chronic myocarditis and dilatative cardiomyopathy [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . and type 1 diabetes is also strongly suspected because several studies detected enteroviral RNA and/or viral proteins in peripheral blood and/or pancreatic tissue of patients with type 1 diabetes [15, 16, 17, 18] . HRV infection usually presents as an acute infection with viral shedding of up to 42 days as shown by experimental HRV infection [19] . A recent study followed healthy infants in the first year of life and found that HRV RNA rarely persisted beyond 30 days after HRV infection [20] . Persistent HRV infection has been occasionally described in immunosuppressed patients, namely transplant recipients [21, 22, 23] and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia [24, 25] but to date it is unclear how widespread the phenomenon of HRV persistence is. In fact, in a previous study we found no evidence for HRV persistence in asthmatic children [4] .",

The details of the distribution of these patient groups with regard to the total number of specimens tested per patient is shown in S2 Table.

To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of persistent HRV/enterovirus infections so far published. Most patients in this study were hospitalized (54/76, 71.1%) and immunosuppression was frequent (47/76, 61.8%). All but one patients with persistent infection were immunosuppressed, and immunosuppression was associated with HRV/enterovirus persistence (p = 0.003, Table 1 ). The only patient with persistent infection who was not immunosuppressed suffered from cystic fibrosis. To our knowledge there is only one other report of HRV persistence in a cystic fibrosis patient, namely a HRV-A infection in a 43 year-old-patient [28] . In contrast, our patient had an infection with HRV-B69. Hematologic disorders were the underlying condition in most patients with HRV/ enterovirus persistence and statistically associated with persistence (p = 0.001, Table 1 ). Interestingly, a recent study found HRV persistence in 8 paediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [29] . In our study, 10 of the 18 patients (55.6%) with persistent infection were stem cell transplant recipients, 1 child and 9 adults. This population of highly immunosuppressed patients seems to be predisposed for HRV/enterovirus persistence. The minimum median duration of HRV/enterovirus persistence in our patients was 92 days, ranging from 50 to 455 days. To our knowledge, a longer duration of persistence has so far only been described twice [23, 28] .",

Although systematic surveillance for respiratory viruses is not performed at our centre, there is possibly a bias in so far as the physician probably prescribes more readily diagnostics for respiratory viruses in patients that he/she judges at increased risk. That may have led to an overrepresentation of immunosuppressed patients in our study population. However, the fact that immunosuppressed patients probably had more specimens sent for diagnostics for respiratory viruses does not mean that these were necessarily persistent infections. This is supported by the fact that specimen number was not significantly different between the reinfection and persistence groups (Table 1) .

Persistence was assumed in patients who harboured the same HRV/enterovirus type in consecutive specimens even if these were taken at a long time interval because reinfection with the same type seems extremely unlikely due to host immunity and due to the high number of circulating types of HRV. In patients in whom we did not find evidence for persistence (i.e. those who had a different HRV type in the second specimen), we do not have data on the duration of the infection with the different HRV types. This is a point that has to be addressed in future studies as well as the clinical relevance of HRV persistence. This is important, because, like persistence of other enteroviruses, HRV persistence might be associated with chronic diseases, for example diabetes type 1 or dilatative cardiomyopathy. The fact that the second respiratory specimen was obtained at various time intervals following the first HRV/enterovirus positive specimen also impacted the \"cleared infection\" group. Only 25 patients had a negative follow-up specimen that was taken in the time interval of 3 to 44 days after the first specimen and thus permitted to classify them as \"cleared infection\". 49 patients had a negative follow-up specimen that was taken 45 days or longer after the first specimen. Thus a persistent infection (according to our definition) could not be excluded and therefore these patients were not included in the \"cleared infection\" group.",
