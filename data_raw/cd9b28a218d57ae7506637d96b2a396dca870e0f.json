In January 2012, the project SARI case definition was changed to the revised WHO SARI case definition (2011), which applied to all cases of any age [11] .

Isolation of influenza virus from a patient meeting the SARI case definition does not prove causality as influenza has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals in several studies [22] . Although the SARI case definition broadened over the course of the study, it likely does not fully capture all cases that might be hospitalized with respiratory illness due to influenza [11] . Moreover, it is likely that the broadening of the case definition resulted in increases in the number of patients enrolled and influenza cases detected. There may also have been limitations in the performance of surveillance. All participating hospitals provided care across the age spectrum, but SARI cases were predominately under five years of age and there were few deaths among the elderly. It is possible that the SARI case definition is less sensitive for elderly patients than for pediatric cases, that there was less surveillance among medical wards with elderly patients, or that healthcare seeking behavior of the elderly differs from that of children with a greater tendency for health seeking in young children. While efforts were made to regularly train staff in active case finding, no audits were done to assess how well or how completely the case definitions were applied. Consequently, there is the potential that differential effort was made in capturing pediatric versus adult cases for enrollment and testing.",

As aforementioned, no audits were done to assess the completeness of case ascertainment; however, it is possible that the detection of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in July 2009 led to heightened awareness about influenza and greater adherence to surveillance protocols. This hypothesis is supported by WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) data, which show an increase in positive influenza specimens beginning in 2010, predominantly of the subtype influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. [23] The exclusion of Nahdha Hospital, a large referral hospital located in the capital, Muscat, may have impacted findings. The catchment population of Nahdha Hospital overlaps with three other tertiary care and two other secondary care hospitals that receive SARI cases in Muscat and more severe cases may go to two of these other facilities (the Royal and University hospitals). Therefore, estimates from Nahdha Hospital would most probably underestimate the true SARI incidence. Determining the denominator population for use in the incidence estimate of this large referral hospital would have been problematic hence Nahdha Hosptial was excluded from analyses.",

The epidemiology of pandemic influenza has been documented to be different from that of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with a higher burden among school-age children and young adults. [24] Initiating influenza surveillance in Oman has had a number of important benefits. Firstly, it provides important information to drive policy on influenza control in Oman. Since 2001, the Oman Ministry of Heath has recommended and offered influenza vaccine to healthcare workers at no cost.
