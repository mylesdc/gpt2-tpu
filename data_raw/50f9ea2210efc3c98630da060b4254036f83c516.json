Infections in pregnant cattle lead to abortion via transplacental (congenitally from mother to fetus) transmission. In this study, a N. caninum profilin (NcPROF), was expressed in silkworm larvae by recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid and was purified from the hemolymph. Three NcPROF constructs were investigated, native NcPROF fused with an N-terminal PA tag (PA-NcPROF), PA-NcPROF fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF), and bx-PA-NcPROF with additional C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM). All recombinant proteins were observed extra-and intracellularly in cultured Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was partly abnormally secreted, even though it has the transmembrane domain, and only it was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, but PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. Additionally, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified from silkworm hemolymph by anti-PA agarose beads while PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. The purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein bound to its receptor, mouse Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR-11), and formed unique nanoparticles. These results suggest that profilin fused with GP64TM was secreted as a nanoparticle with binding affinity to its receptor and this nanoparticle formation is advantageous for the development of vaccines to N. caninum.",

Although the morphologies are quite similar, these parasites are biologically different and are considered as zoonotic compared with toxoplasmosis where it affects human, sheep and many other warm-blooded animals [3] . Neosporosis infection occurs from unsporulated oocysts in feces followed by ingestion by the cattle, transformation from the transformed into Escherichia coli BmDH10Bac, respectively, as described previously [15] .

The mixture of each recombinant BmNPV bacmid DNA was incubated at room temperature (RT) for approximately 45 min before injection into the silkworm larvae. Subsequently, approximately 50 \u00b5L of the mixture was injected into a fifth instar silkworm larva (Ehime Sansyu, Ehime, Japan), and the larvae were reared at 25 \u2022 C and 65 \u00b1 5% relative humidity with the artificial diet Silkmate S2 (Nosan, Yokohama, Japan) for 6-7 day. The collected hemolymph was diluted with 10-fold of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and was injected again into fifth-instar silkworm larva and reared for 4-5 d. The larval hemolymph was collected through cutting the caudal leg, was mixed with 5 \u00b5L of 200 mM 1-phenyl-2-thiourea, and then was centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C.

For the expression of NcPROF in Bm5 cells, diluted hemolymph containing recombinant BmNPVs was added to the cultured Bm5 cells in a 6-well plate at 27 \u2022 C in Sf-900II medium (ThermoFisher Scientific K.K.) supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific K.K.) and 10% FBS (Gibco, Tokyo, Japan).

The culture supernatant (culture media) was collected after centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C together with the same solution as the larval hemolymph. Infected-Bm5 cells were mixed with the same solution and were subjected to the same treatment as the larval fat body, followed by separation of cell lysate soluble and insoluble fractions after centrifugation. The supernatants of the larval hemolymph, fat body, cell medium, cell lysate soluble, and insoluble were immediately frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until further analysis.",

            "text": "In this study, three NcPROF constructs were generated. PA-NcPROF has a PA tag sequence at its N-terminus ( Figure 1A) , whereas bx-PA-NcPROF has the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori at its N-terminus ( Figure 1B) . Meanwhile, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM has the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV at the C-terminus of bx-PA-NcPROF ( Figure 1C ). The bombyxin signal peptide (bx) is responsible for the secretion of recombinant proteins to the hemolymph of silkworm larvae [17, 18] . The GP64TM were used as a fusion partner with NcPROF as a target protein to be incorporated into the cell membrane [19] . All NcPROF constructs were observed in both the fat body and hemolymph when they were expressed in silkworm larvae (Figure 2A ). PA-NcPROF, bx-PA-NcPROF, and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM comprise 176, 195, and 226 amino acids, respectively, and their estimated molecular weights are 19, 21, and 25 kDa, respectively. All NcPROFs were expressed and verified intra-and extracellularly in Bm5 cells ( Figure 2B ). The molecular weight of PA-NcPROF was approximately 25 kDa by western blotting. The molecular weight of native NcPROF in this study was similar to that of full-length profilin expressed in E. coli (22 kDa) [12] . This finding suggests that PA-NcPROF expressed in silkworm larvae may be not modified posttranslationally. bx-PA-NcPROF was observed in the fat body and hemolymph at 25-30 kDa as a large obscure band that appeared as two bands. The molecular weight of the lower band was the same as that of PA-NcPROF and that of the upper band was larger than that of PA-NcPROF. This finding suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF may be partially modified posttranslationally after the cleavage of the bombyxin signal peptide. In fact, N128 was predicted as an N-glycosylation site estimated by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM product was observed at 30-40 kDa by western blotting. Interestingly, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was observed in the hemolymph and culture medium although it was fused with the transmembrane domain of GP64. In our previous report, N. caninum-derived antigens NcSAG1 and NcSRS2 fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 were not observed in hemolymph [9] . In this study, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted into hemolymph, in part, and the culture medium from Bm5 cells. It has been reported that profilins of T. gondii and Babesia canis were partially secreted even though no signal peptide is predicted in these genes [20, 21] . In this study, NcPROF was also secreted regardless of the addition of the signal sequence. To investigate N-glycosylation of the N-glycan of three NcPROFs, PNGase F treatment was carried out ( Figure S1 ). Molecular weight of each NcPROF was not changed between before and after the PNGase F treatment, indicating no N-glycan was attached into the three NcPROFs. These results suggest that the two bands of bx-PA-NcPROF did not come from its N-glycosylation. Hence, it showed that the bx-PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM were not posttranslationally modified with an N-glycan in endoplasmic reticulum even though these proteins have the bx signal peptide. In addition, the discrepancy of the molecular weight of each PROF to its estimated that was not caused by the N-glycosylation. In nature, estimated pI of this NcPROF is around 4.89, which may have influence on the mobility of NcPROFs on the SDS-PAGE gel [22] . In addition, the negative charge of acidic residues may create repulsion and this repulsion caused the anomalous migration of protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels [23] . This may be the reason why the molecular weight of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was increased.",

It showed that PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not precipitated by ultracentrifugation (100,000\u00d7 g), while bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was pelleted. Normally, transmembrane proteins are anchored in the membrane fraction of cells and are not easily secreted. However, glycoproteins from some viruses are secreted and are partially incorporated into extracellular vesicles when they are overexpressed [24, 25] . Moreover, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV facilitated the display of recombinant proteins on BmNPV particles. These findings suggest that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted as nanoparticles or by display on the envelope of BmNPV particles. bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was then purified from silkworm hemolymph using anti-PA tag agarose. As shown in Figure 4A , bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified as a single band in SDS-PAGE and was further verified by western blotting ( Figure 4B ). This finding indicates that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM does not display on the surface of BmNPV particles because no band was observed in the purified sample except for bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM. These results suggested that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM forms only some nanoparticles and can be secreted into hemolymph and the culture broth. The yield of purified NcPROF-GP64TM was approximately 14 \u00b5g from 3 mL of larval hemolymph.",

            "text": "Recently, it was reported that TLR is responsible for parasite recognition and the induction of cytokines in T. gondii [26] . NcPROF induces limited protection and the T-cell response in mice [13] . In this study, NcPROF expressed in silkworms was investigated to determine whether it binds to recombinant mTLR11. The binding of purified bx-NcPROF-GP64TM to mTLR11 was not clearly observed compared with that of the negative control. Because bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM formed multimers under nonreducing conditions, DTT was then added to purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM before ELISA ( Figure 5A,B) . As shown in Figure 5C , the specific binding was enhanced by an increment of almost 72.7% after DTT treatment and simultaneously increased the binding ability when different concentrations (100, 300, 500 ng/well) were challenged. Hence, it suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM expressed in silkworm larvae is functional. These results indicate that multimer formation might prevent bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM from binding to mTLR11. Similar to the results of a previous study, Hedhli et al. [27] , showed that PROF of T. gondii secreted into Drosophila S2 cell broth with the signal sequence of insect binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) enhanced the cellular and humoral responses in mice after DTT treatment. These results indicate that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted through the secretory pathway in the host and irregular disulfide bonds were formed in the endoplasmic reticulum. In nature, NcPROF does not have the signal peptide at its N-terminus and does not enter the endoplasmic reticulum [20, 28] . ",

            "text": "The morphology of purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was observed using TEM. Nanoparticles with a diameter of 30 nm were observed in purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM ( Figure 6A ). To further analyze the purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM, immuno-TEM was conducted. The recombinant proteins were probed with rat anti-PA tag (NZ-1) and goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) conjugated with 12-nm gold beads. As shown in Figure 6B , bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM demonstrated a spherical morphology with a diameter of approximately 30 nm. These results indicate that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted as nanoparticles ( Figure 3) . Vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) could be recovered from the culture supernatant when VSV-G alone was expressed in mammalian cells [24, 25] . Similarly, the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was incorporated into exosomes when its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were replaced with those of VSV-G [29] . Extracellular vesicles containing virus-encoded glycoprotein were secreted into the culture supernatant when mammalian cells were infected with the modified Vaccinia virus Ankara strain [30] . Additionally, glycoprotein 64 (AcGP64) of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus was secreted into the culture medium when AcGP64 was expressed in mammalian cells [31] . In this study, it is possible that the bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein formed nanoparticles when it was expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells. In our previous paper, antigens of N. caninum fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 were displayed on the surface of BmNPV particles, but few of these fusion proteins were secreted into silkworm hemolymph [9] . These studies suggest that the secretion of recombinant fusion proteins with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 depends on the properties of recombinant proteins of interest. Currently, nanoparticles were only observed in purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM but not in the other two constructs. Additionally, when purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was treated with 1% TritonX-100, some of this protein moved to the fraction at low sucrose concentration during sucrose density gradient centrifugation ( Figure S3 ), implying that this fusion protein forms nanoparticles. We are investigating whether these nanoparticles are aggregates or not and how these nanoparticles form. Apicomplexan profilin, including NcPROF, is a promising protein target with an adjuvant activity as a vaccine candidate [10] . Previous research from Gause et al. [32] , stated that delivery of the subunit antigen using particle-based delivery systems can lead to significant improvement in immunogenicity because these systems have now been enhanced by engineering through the physiochemical properties of the particle to promote an immune response. Hence, it was advantageous to purify bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM because it naturally forms unique functional nanoparticles without modification through its physiochemical properties to deliver subunit antigens through a particle-based delivery system. Antigen-displaying nanoparticles have been normally prepared by the co-expression of viral structural proteins and antigens or chemical conjugation and genetic fusion of antigens to virus-like particles [33, 34] . In this study, NcPROF-displaying nanoparticles were prepared in insect cells and silkworm larvae only by expression of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM, which has the bombyxin signal sequence and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 at its N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively.",

NP_001103771.1) at its N-terminus and transmembrane cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (GP64TM) (GenBank accession no. BAF32568.1) at its C-terminus. The synthetic sequence of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was digested using EcoRI (NEB, Tokyo, Japan) and NotI (NEB, Tokyo, Japan) and was cloned into pFastBac1 (ThermoFisher Scientific. K.K., Tokyo, Japan), resulting in the construct pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM. The gene coding bx-PA-NcPROF was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using (bx-PA-NcPROF) with primer sets ( Table 1 ). The amplified gene was digested by EcoRI and XhoI and was cloned into pFastbac1, resulting in the construct pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF. Additionally, pFast/PA-NcPROF and pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF were generated by PCR amplification with primers listed in Table 1 and then underwent self-ligation. Subsequently, the constructed pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM, pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF, and pFast/bx-PA-NcPROF were Acknowledgments: We extend our deep appreciation to Jeawook Lee and Kenshin Takemura for their help and guidance for acquiring the TEM and immuno-TEM images.",
