Determining whether behavior at intake may predict subsequent illness in the animal shelter may influence the management of dogs housed at animal shelters and reduce overall disease. While normally associated with mild disease and low mortality rates, respiratory disease nevertheless poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the stressful environment of animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether behavior at intake can predict subsequent occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease in dogs at animal shelters. In a correlational study, 84 dogs were assessed throughout their stay at a city animal shelter. The dogs were subjected to a behavioral assessment, 1 min in-kennel behavioral observations across two observation periods, and the collection of urinary cortisol:creatinine (C:C) ratio. The occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease was monitored through repeated clinical exams (rectal temperature and the occurrence of nasal and ocular discharge, and presence of coughing and sneezing). A basic PLS Path regression model revealed that time in the shelter (estimate = .53, p < .001), and sociability (estimate = .24, p < .001) and curiosity scores (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and anxiety scores, however, were not associated with illness. Urinary C:C, taken on the first full day, did not predict subsequent illness when accounting for time. Limitations included attrition of dogs, a small percentage receiving vaccinations, and continuous and non-systematic rotation of dogs in the kennels. Understanding if behavior can predict subsequent illness may improve shelter management practices, and in turn, result in improved live-release outcomes.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease, while normally associated with mild symptoms and low mortality rates, poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the highly stressful environment of PLOS animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature [1] . Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), also known as kennel cough complex, is composed both of bacterial and viral agents associated with low mortality but high prevalence (canine adenovirus-2, canine parainfluenza virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, canine herpesvirus, canine influenza, Mycoplasma bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma cynos) and agents associated with high mortality though much lower prevalence (canine distemper virus and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus [1] [2] [3] ). CIRDC signs include ocular and nasal discharge and cough [1] . The highly infectious nature of the complex has implications for animal shelters due to the need to isolate symptomatic animals, inability to neuter infected animals, and the reluctance of potential adopters to bring infectious animals into their homes, where they may have other dogs. Associated veterinary care for symptomatic animals also taxes limited shelter resources [4] . Finally, canine distemper and Strep zoo, though less prevalent than the others in the complex, can be associated with significant loss of life in a crowded shelter [5] . The outcome of these challenges is that many shelter dogs exhibiting signs of CIRDC may be euthanized rather than placed for adoption if there are budget and/or time constraints [6, 7] . Not only does the shelter provide an ideal setting for disease transmission, with dogs housed in close proximity to each other, but the stress of the shelter environment likely reduces the immune system's ability to respond to microbial challenge [1, 8] . Differential susceptibility to various pathogens has been well established in young dogs and pregnant females [9] as well as individuals who are immunocompromised due to an already established disease (e.g., feline immunodeficiency virus [10] ). However, other less obvious factors, such as increased stress, may increase susceptibility in the shelter. The shelter environment presents an array of psychosocial stressors for dogs, resulting in increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as indicated by elevated cortisol levels in animals in that environment compared to animals in pet homes, at least in the first few days after admittance [11] . The HPA axis is the pathway that is responsible for the activation of the stress response in animals. An environmental stressor triggers the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin, which, in turn, stimulate the production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) in the anterior pituitary. The release of the latter hormone stimulates the release of corticosterone or cortisol from the adrenal cortex into the blood stream, depending on the species [12, 13] . The high levels of cortisol (or corticosterone) inhibit further production of the CRH and ACTH resulting in a negative feedback loop (see [14] for a discussion in shelter dogs). Cortisol levels negatively correlate with the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) in dogs [15] . Yet s-IgA plays a central role in the mucosal immune system, the body's primary defense against infection of the respiratory system [16] .",

Correlations between behavior and physiological ability to cope with environmental stressors, such as disease and parasite infection, have been demonstrated in a wide variety of species. Capitanio, Medoza, and Baroncelli [18] found that rhesus macaques that were high in the sociability trait showed a more rapid decrease in plasma cortisol concentrations, a higher IgG response, and a lower viral load when challenged with a simian immunodeficiency virus. Pigs that spent more time struggling when flipped over on their backs for a brief amount of time, have been found to have a higher concentration of cortisol and lower immune function [19] . Free-roaming tom cats that were higher in aggression had a higher viral load of feline immunodeficiency virus [20] . Trapped Norway rats, who had a higher presence of wounds (as an indicator of aggression), also showed a higher level of hantavirus infection, and in turn, higher infection status males showed elevated serum testosterone and corticosterone concentrations, among other differences in neurotransmitters [21] . The activity-exploration profiles of Siberian chipmunks, as measured by a standardized test, predicted the numbers of ticks present on the animals; tick load increased with space use [22] . More recently, the predictive effect of behavior on immune function under chronic stress conditions has been extensively explored in cattle [23, 24] . Temperamental cattle, those that display shorter latency to exit and higher velocity when exiting their enclosure, have been shown to have a higher cortisol concentration and a weaker immune response to pathogens [23] .",

The complex \"boldness\" trait was statistically derived from scores from several other tested traits (e.g., activity, attentiveness, dominance, and sociability).

Withholding vaccination from all dogs would have made our results easier to interpret. However, dogs are routinely vaccinated in shelters with multivalent vaccines that include highly effective protection against lethal diseases such as distemper virus and parvovirus. For this reason, withholding vaccination for the purposes of this study was not deemed ethical. At the time of the study, the animal shelter had poor disease management practices, including poor sanitation, poor medical care, no vaccination at-intake, overcrowding, and continuous rotation of dogs in the kennels.

This short observation period was previously used to detect behavioral differences across kenneled dogs in the animal shelter environment [28, 29] . On Days 1 through 14, using a slip lead, the dogs were led outside into a 34m x 26m fenced yard and the dog's health was assessed. The yard contained synthetic grass and concrete with a large window looking into the yard from inside the shelter. On Day 3, prior to the health assessment, a behavioral assessment was conducted and saliva and urine were collected. If insufficient volumes of these samples were obtained, the sample collection was repeated for Day 5 or 6. Saliva samples were collected prior to the health exam using inert polymer swabs (SalivaBio Children's Swab, Salimetrics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) held in the dog's mouth for 60 s, but were lost due to human error during analysis; therefore, no data are reported.",

When considering each behavioral variable for each observation period, 254 behavioral variables were scored across the study period. We implemented a variable quality selection procedure.

Second, we removed all variables that showed little variability across dogs. Variables with a standard deviation of less than .01 were removed, leaving a total of 141 behaviors.

To test the hypothesis that Curiosity, Sociability, Anxiety, and Activity may impact illness risk, the coded behaviors were categorized into latent variables by the first author based on previous research by Hennessy et al. (see Table 5 [31, [33] [34] [35] [36] ). Each behavioral indicator variable was included as a reflective indicator of the latent variable. For the classification of behaviors not listed in the previous study, we attempted to group similar behaviors into established categories. For example, \"gazing\" and \"proximity\" to car were grouped with \"approach\" to car. In-kennel behaviors were interpreted taking into account previous research that showed that some behaviors correlated strongly together and were emitted by dogs when a person was actively interacting with them through the kennel [29] . Previous research has shown that \"back of kennel\" is highly correlated with \"front of kennel\" and can be considered in unison; the same phenomenon occurs for \"facing forward\" and \"facing backwards\". Combined, these can be labeled \"back and forth facing or motion\" as was done in Protopopova et al. An example of this phenomenon can be demonstrated by observing a dog pacing back and forth in the kennel. Because \"gazing\", \"jumping on cage\", \"barking\", \"whining\", and \"wagging tail\" increased in previous research when a person actively solicited attention, these may be considered as part of sociability [29] . Hekman and colleagues previously found that panting and lip licking were positively correlated with salivary cortisol concentrations, indicating stress [37] . Thus, we included \"panting\" and \"licking self\" into the \"anxiety\" latent variable. \"Leaning on the wall\" has previously been found to correlate with a long length of stay at the shelter [29] , which may indicate some form of distress. Therefore, we elected to place this behavior into the \"anxiety\" latent variable; however, we recognize that this Table 4 . Operational definitions of the additional behaviors that were observed in the sociability and the curiosity components during the behavioral assessment. was a subjective decision. \"Barking\" and \"proximity to the experimenter\" during the boldness/ shyness test were logically grouped into the \"anxiety\" latent variable as they may have indicated distress of the dog as a result of the toy car; again, we recognize that this was a subjective decision. All activity-related behaviors were grouped into the \"activity\" latent variable.",

Most dogs were available for the behavioral assessments through the first 3-4 days; however, only 19 dogs remained by day 14. During this time, health became progressively worse. Fig 2 shows the change in the health observations across time. Health steadily worsened as indicated by increases in the severity of the illness observation scores. In addition, temperature increased indicative of fever. Fig 3 shows the mean rectal temperature across time as well as the 95% confidence interval (boot-strapped confidence intervals obtained via packages ggplot2) [38] . The dotted line indicates the threshold for fever (39\u02daC). At study initiation, the 95% confidence interval was well below the fever threshold.

Across time, each sign of upper respiratory illness (coughing, sneezing, ocular and nasal discharge, and fever) became more severe. Whereas increases in all signs of illness were already evident as early as the third day in the shelter, by two weeks, the average dog in this animal shelter had a fever, colored nasal discharge, clear ocular discharge, and half of dogs were coughing and/or sneezing. This data supports previous research that found that the risk of coughing increased by 3% each day [39] . Out of the four behavioral components, only Sociability and, to a much lesser extent, Curiosity, but not Activity or Anxiety was associated with illness. Dogs who had higher standardized scores in both Sociability and Curiosity in the first few days after intake, were more likely to have higher illness scores. Sociability consisted of tail wagging and jumping on the cage when a person came up to the kennel and jumping, leaning on, and staying in proximity to the person during the sociability test. Curiosity consisted of paying attention to the remote-controlled car (approaching, retreating from, gazing at, and staying in proximity to the car) during the boldness test. The decision to label these behaviors as \"Curiosity\" rather than \"Boldness\" was arbitrary and was informed by subjective opinion by the authors that the dogs' behavior was more closely in line with the human concept of curiosity (i.e., information seeking) rather than boldness (e.g., a willingness to take risks). Furthermore, in our study, we did not assess for repeatability and thus are limited in the interpretations of our data in terms of personality or temperament literature.",

However, the relationship appeared less clear between standardized Curiosity and Illness scores, with some potential outliers driving the positive correlation. It is also noteworthy that Sociability and Curiosity were moderately correlated, suggesting a potential underlying trait or that a more complex path model might be suggested for future larger studies. Previous research has suggested that the various behavioral components may be part of a greater whole. For example, Svartberg and Forkman [36] suggested that various traits, such as sociability and exploration, among others, may be related to a single higher-order dimension. Corsetti and colleagues [26] have also combined the individual traits of activity, attentiveness, dominance, and sociability to differentiate dogs into proactive and reactive coping styles. However, they found that dogs displaying the proactive style (higher boldness, higher sociability) had a lower incidence of illness; our current results seem to be contrary to this previous data. However, Corsetti et al. [26] did not find any statistically significant predictors when assessing individual traits, such as boldness, activity, sociability, or anxiety; the lack of statistically significant correlations among individual traits to illness ). Urinary C:C ratio, taken on the first full day, was not associated with subsequent illness in the animal shelter. Previous research suggests that coping style has a link with the responsiveness of the HPA axis. The proactive coping style has previously been found to correlate with low cortisol responses in dogs [40, 41] . And in fact, we did find that cortisol had a low negative correlation with the sociability component. Interestingly, the same negative correlation of cortisol and sociability (but to conspecifics) was found in rhesus macaques [18] . However, instead of the proactive temperament protecting the dogs from illness (through the reduction of cortisol), we found a positive association between sociability and illness. As the correlation between cortisol and sociability was low, this finding may be a Type I error, and no true relationship may exist between the two in this population; alternatively, the relationship between proactive coping style and HPA reactivity may differ in this species or in this environment.",

The probability of encountering a parasite increases mechanically as the animal engages in exploratory behavior. For example, pumpkinseed sunfish that exhibited a bold temperament were more likely to have a higher parasite load [42] . Tom cats who exhibited a more dominant and bold temperament were also more likely to be infected with feline immunodeficiency virus [20] . Norway rats with higher testosterone were more likely to engage in fighting and more likely to have a hantavirus infection [21] . Wood mice that were infected by nematode exhibited more locomotion [43] . Similarly, in our study, dogs that were more curious and social may have encountered more infected surfaces, thus were more exposed to pathogens than dogs that were not curious nor social. However, during the time of the study, the animals were typically group housed in relatively small kennels with continuous rotation of animals and no sanitation prior to new arrivals. Therefore, the already very high risk of transmission in this particular shelter reduces the likelihood that the RoP hypothesis accounts for the entirety of these results. Nevertheless, this hypothesis remains a viable candidate for the explanation of the found phenomenon, and more data and experiments are required.",

            "text": "An additional hypothesis has been put forth to explain whole-animal differences in immune function, the Pace-of-Life-Syndrome (PoLS) hypothesis. The PoLS hypothesis has originally been used to differentiate different species by their \"pace of life,\" or metabolic and reproductive evolutionary strategy [44, 45] . For example, some species may prioritize reproduction but not immune function or longevity. This strategy may be regarded as \"live fast, die young.\" In contrast, some species may prioritize longevity and immune function instead of reproduction -the \"live slow, die old\" strategy [45, 46] . Recently, the PoLS hypothesis has been utilized to explain whole animal differences within a single species [47] . In fact, such differences have been previously suggested in dogs [48] . Thus, it is possible that intra-species differences in dogs may also follow these two evolutionary strategies, with one strategy prioritizing immune function and the other prioritizing reproduction. Perhaps dogs that are curious and social are utilizing the \"live fast, die young\" strategy, and are thus not prioritizing immune function. In fact, due to dogs' reliance on human influence, perhaps human-directed sociability is a strategy for dogs to ensure medical care; thus, by putting more resources into sociability, fewer resources are needed for immune system function. Chersini, Hall, and Wynne [49] suggested that dogs may utilize human intervention for their survival; people rate pups at weaning as most desirable, and this is also the time when dams leave their pups to fend for themselves. With pup survival being only around 70% in free-ranging situations, human involvement becomes crucial to the dog [50] . While intriguing, our current data are not adequate for supporting or refuting this hypothesis. In order to provide support, future data need to show that social and curious dogs also have higher litter size, higher basal metabolic function, and shorter lives. In addition, future data would need to show that people will spend more money or effort on healthcare of social dogs.",
