However, information from a variety of words in article titles, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus used to evaluate research trends in global stem cell research was published in 2009 (14) . It was concluded that the application of stem cell transplantation technology to human disease therapy had become the orientation of all stem cell research in the 21 st century. In 2012, several bibliometric analyses of applications relating to stem cell transplantation technology were reported for diseases such as Parkinson's disease (15) , cerebral ischemia (16) , spinal cord injury (17) , Duchenne muscular dystrophy (18) and epilepsy (19) . A sharp increase in stem cell research has been observed since 1991 (14) . Not only have publicly and privately funded scientists been working in the field of stem cells, multi-national government funded policies have become equally as influential, for instance, the impact of federal funding policy (20) , the Japanese government (14, 21) and Canadian research policy (22) .",

The database was searched under the keywords \"pluripotent stem cell\" and \"pluripotent stem cells\" in terms of topic (title, abstract, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus) within the publication year with a limit of 1991 to 2012. KeyWords Plus supplied additional search terms extracted from the titles of articles cited by authors in their bibliographies and footnotes in the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI; now Thomson Reuters, New York) database, and substantially augmented title-word and author-keyword indexing (23) . Non-article-type documents such as reviews, meeting abstracts, editorial materials, proceedings papers, letters, book chapters, news items, corrections, and notes were excluded. The final filter was the front page, in which only the articles having the search keywords in their first page including article title, abstract, and author keywords were retained (24) . The impact factor of a journal was based on the Journal Citation Report 2012. The number of citations of an article in a single year, for example 2012, was referred to as the C2012 and the total number of citations since publication to 2012 was referred to as the TC2012 (25, 26) . The collaboration type was determined by the addresses of the authors. Collaboration could be classified as either a single-country article, in which all authors' addresses were from the same country, or an international collaborative article, which was co-authored by researchers from multiple countries (27) . The records were downloaded and reorganized using Microsoft Excel 2010. In the SCI-EXPANDED database, the corresponding author was designated as the \"reprint\" author; this study instead used the term \"corresponding author\". In a single author article where authorship was unspecified, the single author was both first author and corresponding author. Similarly, for a single institution article, the institution was classified as the first author's institution and the corresponding author's institution. Affiliations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were reclassified as being from the United Kingdom (UK) (27) . Affiliations in Czechoslovakia were checked to be in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Affiliations in Hong Kong before 1997 were included with China (24) .",

The 2,844 articles were authored by 12,914 authors, among whom 9,648 (75%) contributed to only one article, 1,790 (14%) contributed to two articles, 653 (5.1%) contributed to three articles, 326 (2.5%) contributed to four articles, 159 (1.2%) contributed to five articles and 338 (2.6%) contributed to six or more articles. Moreover, 126 articles (4.4%) were single-author articles, 250 (8.8%) had two authors, 257 (9.0%) had three authors, 254 (8.9%) had four authors, 293 (10%) had five authors, 257 (9.0%) had six authors, 247 (8.7%) had seven authors, 233 (8.2%) had eight authors, 211 (7.4%) had nine authors, 154 (5.4%) had ten authors and 562 (20%) had more than ten authors. Figure 1 shows publication trends with articles searched by keywords \"pluripotent stem cell\" and \"pluripotent stem cells\" in terms of topic (title, abstract, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus), front page (title, abstract, author keywords), and article title only. In recent years, more pluripotent stem cell related articles have been published and the keywords are not always found in the article titles. Number of articles located via SCI-EXPANDED and the number of articles with the required keywords somewhere in the front page of the article were not the same. The rapid increase in the number of articles published after 2007 can be attributed to a couple of groundbreaking articles on pluripotent stem cell research. In 2006 and 2007, Takahashi at Kyoto University of Japan published as first author in Cell, articles entitled \"Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors\" (28) and \"Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors\" (29) . Within the same time period followed literature such as, \"Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells\" (30) , \"Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells\" (31) and \"In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state\" (32). Table 1 presents the top articles cited in TC2012. Out of these 10 articles, seven were published after 2003 and one in 1991, 1998 and 2001, respectively. The journals in which these articles were published were Cell [impact factor (IF2012=31.957)] with four articles, and Nature (IF2012=38.597) with three articles, and one each in Nature Biotechnology (IF2012=32.438), Science (IF2012=31.027) and Tissue Engineering (IF2012=4.065). The citation index of an article might not be a direct measure of its quality or importance; it is a measure of recognition that may suggest its visibility or impact on the scientific community (33) . Some scientists previously studied the citation life cycles of highly cited articles (34, 35) . The articles with top TC2012 were recently reported (24) . The citation lives of the top ten articles are shown in figure 2 . The articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular articles in the last 20 years. In general, only the trends of the top three articles by Takahashi and Yamanaka (28) in 2006, Takahashi et al. (29) in 2007, and Yu et al. (30) in 2007 saw continuous sharp increases since their publication years, while the slopes of the other publications climbed initially but then reached a plateau after which they continued to be of high impact with more than 100 annual citations. However, the article by Chaudhary and Roninson (12) in 1991, which reached its peak citation rate five years alter its publication, subsequently decreased to 17 citations in 2012. Highly cited articles may not always be those with the highest impact (36) . Some of the top ten highly cited articles in 2012 had just been published, for example in 2009 (25) . Their citation lives are shown in figure 3 . The articles with the highest C2012 were considered those with the most impact in the past few years. Recently published articles, for example, \"Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells\" (37) and \"Somatic coding mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cells\" (38) have great potential, but they did not have a high TC2012 because the time span was not sufficient to accumulate a large number of citations.",

In total, 2,844 articles were published in SCI-EXPANDED from 1991 to 2012. Articles were published in 689 journals and were listed in 95 Web of Science categories in the science edition in 2012. Stem Cells and PLoS One were the most common journals in pluripotent stem cell research. Mainstream research was in Web of Science category cell biology. There was a sharp increase in articles annually after 2007. Articles without the required search words on their front page could be still found in SCI-EXPAND-ED which is designed for researchers to find literature but not for bibliometric study. The citation lives of the top articles in total citations as well as in publication year and recent year showed that the impact of top articles in a research field might alter according to novelty and not only time. In general, the so-called \"classic\" articles had low citations in their publication year. The G7 were part of the top ten countries in terms of publication. It was noted that the USA, as a country, contributed the most independent and internationally collaborative articles, as well as the most first and corresponding author articles. Institutionally, Harvard University published the most inter-institutional articles and overall articles, while Kyoto University published the most first and corresponding author articles. The papers of the Nobel Prize winner in 2012, Prof. Shinya Yamanaka, who published four articles ranked among the top ten in terms of total citations and citations in the most recent year, have followed a distinguished pattern with steep slopes indicating rapidly increasing citation counts. Stud-ies on induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been found to be the most popular research focus in recent years in pluripotent stem cell research. As seen by the popularity of stem cell research in various countries and the acknowledgment of the potential of pluripotent stem cells to aid in patient specific therapies in our ever increasing elderly population, regenerative medicine will continue to progress with the advent of new research findings.",
