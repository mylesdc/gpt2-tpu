However, since the 20 th century, long term mechanical ventilation (LTMV) has become important in the management of two overlapping groups of patients; those who have recovered from an acute episode of respiratory failure but who require ongoing ventilatory support despite being clinically stable and those who require ventilation electively to avoid the requirement for urgent ventilation. Added to the above, is the increased awareness of the value of a rehabilitative focus, to enhance function and improve autonomy of the ventilator assisted individual (VAI) in a non ICU environment.",

It hinges on the prompt initiation of elective ventilation for those whose conditions are progressing to cardio-respiratory failure. Good clinical and laboratory monitoring is important as the onset of respiratory failure may first be identified through a deterioration of nocturnal blood gases. Progression may include brief exacerbations with respiratory failure requiring ICU management and relatively easy weaning. As with mandatory ventilation, it is necessary to have access to home respiratory care services as well as scheduled monitoring after the initiation of ventilator support. The following example illustrates the relevance of monitoring in those likely to develop respiratory failure.",

It is also influenced by the attitudes and preferences of the patient and family as well as the availability of formal and informal (caregiver) support services. In Europe (Fig. 3) [4] the prevalence of HMV varies widely (France 17/100,000 to Poland 0.1 per 100,000), as does the distribution of diseases requiring ventilatory support (thoracic cage disorders, neuromuscular disorders and airway disorders). If the patient is unable to return home immediately, a chronic assisted ventilatory care (CAVC) unit will provide a safe, non-acute care environment with a rehabilitative focus, to optimize health related quality of life and promote autonomy. The CAVC unit requires a multidimensional continuum of services, by an interdisciplinary team trained both in ventilator management and rehabilitation. The preferred patient is medically stable, mentally alert, understands that ventilatory assistance is long term, is prepared to participate in comprehensive training and will relocate with appropriate supports. In order for a patient to return home, it must be safe and have the required utilities as well as trained care givers. The availability of home health care, technical support and organized followup is critical.",

A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices, can optimize outcome of NIV Non invasive ventilation (NIV) may be considered as one of the most important advances in respiratory medicine over the past 20 years, [8, 9] and is increasingly being utilized world-wide [10] . A PubMed search from January 1966 to March 2015 with the term \"non invasive ventilation\" defines NIV as \"any form of ventilatory support applied without endotracheal intubation (ETI)\". There is strong evidence (Level A) for the use of NIV to prevent ETI in acute on chronic respiratory failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and to facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Less evidence supports the use of NIV for patients with severe acute asthma exacerbations, post-operative or post-extubation acute respiratory failure (ARF), pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8, 9] . Nevertheless, many other potential applications have been proposed [12] . This review will focus on potential new indications for NIV. Although potentially risky, bronchoscopy may be required for some severely hypoxaemic patients [13] . In the past, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) did not recommend flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in such conditions when supplemental oxygen cannot correct an arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) at least to 75 mmHg or an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) to 90 % [14] . On the other hand, non-use of bronchoscopy in these high risk patients may result in less effective, empiric treatment. Until recently, when bronchoscopy wws needed in hypoxaemic conditions, only ETI and mechanical ventilation were available to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Unfortunately, invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with complications related to ETI, baro-or volutrauma, and the loss of airway defense mechanisms. NIV has the potential to avoid these complications while ensuring a similar level of ventilatory efficacy and control of hypoxemia.",

Another RCT in hypoxaemic patients showed that during bronchoscopy NIV increased the PaO 2 /inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO 2 ) ratio, whereas the patients randomised to only oxygen therapy showed a worsening in oxygenation [16] . NIV during bronchoscopy is also useful in hypercapnic COPD patients with pneumonia [17] . CPAP was able to reverse reductions in tidal volume and respiratory flow associated to flexible bronchoscopy in spontaneously breathing young children [18] . In patients with acute exacerbation of COPD due to community-acquired pneumonia, in danger of ETI and unable to clear secretions, NIV with early therapeutic bronchoscopy was feasible, safe and effective [19] . A recent study suggests that in awake, critically ill patients with moderate to severe hypoxaemia undergoing bronchoscopy, the application of NIV is superior to High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen in oxygenation before, during and after the procedure [20] . NIV during bronchoscopy may be performed by means of commercial or modified oronasal or full-face masks [21] . These reports support the use of NIV during fiberoptic bronchoscopy especially when risks of ETI are high, such as in immunocompromised patients. However, an expert team with skills in both endoscopy and NIV should be available for any emergency [12] . In general, this should be performed in ICU.",

Three relatively small studies investigated the effect of home NPPV after acute hypercapnic respiratory failure successfully treated in COPD patients. One study showed that, compared to sham (continuous positive airway pressure) ventilation, NPPV significantly reduced the probability of recurrent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure [55] . Another study compared home NPPV versus standard therapy in chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure patients after acute exacerbation in order to prevent clinical worsening [56] . The authors demonstrated that the probability of clinical worsening was significantly lower in the group receiving home NPPV, with additional improvements observed in exercise capacity.

However, those studies supporting this intervention had limitations, including small sample size, retrospective nature, and a lack of control group. Struik et al. [58] evaluated whether home NPPV after successfully treated acute respiratory failure reduces re-hospitalization and improves survival. The investigators randomized patients to home NPPV or standard treatment 48 h after \"acute\" ventilator support was terminated. The study failed to show a positive effect of home NPPV on time to readmission or death. This was not anticipated and stands in clear contrast to the smaller studies published before. Looking deeper into the study it can be seen that both groups had reductions in PaCO 2 over time. Therefore, one explanation of why this multicenter study was negative was the fact that patients were randomized too early: given the natural course of the disease, patients might have been randomized while they were still recovering from acute hypercapnia. Therefore, home NPPV might have been prescribed to patients not suffering from chronic hypercapnia. This study underscores the importance of carefully selecting patients for home NPPV.",

Therefore, it appears unlikely that differences in 1 year survival between the K\u00f6hnlein study [52] and others [58, 59] are due only to \"high inspiratory pressures\" or simply reductions in PaCO 2 [52] . As a matter of fact, the control group of the K\u00f6hnlein study suffered from a high mortality rate, which may indicate that severity of disease rather than the correction of hypercapnia or the beneficial effect of \"high inspiratory pressures\" primarily drives survival in patients treated with NPPV. Furthermore, claim that chronic hypercapnia is associated to worse survival is questionable -at least in those patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy [43] . Furthermore there is growing evidence that mortality in COPD is influenced by several other factors, such as exercise capacity, comorbidities and inflammatory status [60] .",

From a clinical point of view, it seems reasonable that patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation in hospital and suffering from prolonged hypercapnia, the ones you can define as acute on chronic hypercapnia respiratory failure, might benefit most.

Therefore, despite recent studies adding some new data, the authors cannot recommend the widespread use of this therapeutic intervention after an episode of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure in COPD.

Instead, this modality should be reserved for individual cases, treated in specialized centers experienced with NPPV for the treatment of stable hypercapnic COPD.",

Because of the formula employed for payment by Medicare, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system, hospitals begin to lose large amounts of money when length of stay exceeds 14 days. Transfer of patients out of an acute ICU to a stepdown unit or LTACH saves money on a per-day basis, largely by lower nurse-to-patient ratios, and by increase in the availability of ICU beds for more profitable cases such as elective surgeries.",

Patients randomized to trach collar were disconnected from the ventilator and allowed to breathe through the tracheostomy. During the first day, the patient was allowed to breathe unassisted for a maximum of 12 h. The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and assist-control ventilation was instituted for the next 12 h. On the second day, the 12-h trach-collar challenge followed by assist-control ventilation was repeated. On the third day, the patient was disconnected from the ventilator and allowed to breathe unassisted through the trach collar up to 24 h. In the pressure-support arm, on the first day the initial level was titrated to achieve a total respiratory frequency of less than 30 breaths per minute. Attempts were made to decrease pressure support by 2 cmH 2 O three times each day.

A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that the rate of successful weaning was 1.43 times faster with trach collar than with pressure support.

Of the entire 500 randomized and non-randomized patients, 54 % were alive at 6 months after enrollment and 45 % were alive at 12 months. This survival rate is surprisingly high. To put the numbers in perspective, 1-year survival in older (66 years) patients ventilated in an ICU was approximately 40 % [64, 65] .

During a trach-collar challenge, the amount of respiratory work is determined solely by the patientthe ventilator cannot do any work. As such, a physician observing a patient breathe through a trach collar has a completely clear view of the patient's respiratory capabilities. During pressure support weaning, a clinician's ability to judge weanability is clouded because the patient is receiving ventilator assistance and it is extremely difficult to distinguish between how much work the patient is doing and how much work the ventilator is doing [66] . Accordingly, clinicians are more likely to accelerate the weaning process in patients who perform unexpectedly well during a trach-collar challenge than when a low level of pressure support is being used. This notion is borne out by the Kaplan-Meier plot, which shows that the superiority of trach collar over pressure support was evident within the first ten days of the study [63] .",

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), able to exercise muscles with minor burden on cardio-ventilatory system, can be easily performed in the ICU and applied to muscles of patients laying in bed to prevent the ICU neuromyopathy [77] .",

Provision and maintenance is often carried out by external companies, without any accepted standardisation, and a regular feedback to the clinical centres is usually lacking [84] . The need to reduce healthcare costs has prompted the development of telemedicine for home assistance [85] . However, only few controlled studies evaluating its effectiveness are available so far.

Furthermore, in COPD patients, mechanical ventilation had greater short term effectiveness, based on survival to hospital discharge (76 % vs. 38 %), and had higher 2-month and 6-month survival. Curtis and colleagues [118] pointed out an additional important problem related to EOL is the strategy of communication: the physicians' frequent difficulties in discussing EOL care with patients and their families and caregivers Health care utilization is strongly weighted toward the end of life in COPD as well as in other diseases. For example, Andersson and colleagues [119] showed that more than 68 % of all COPD admissions and 74 % of all days in hospital occurred in the 3.5 years before death. The last 6 months of life accounted for 22 % and 28 % of all COPD admissions and days, respectively. Suboptimal surveillance, inadequate services, and absence of palliative home care are common in severe COPD patients with EOL issues [120] . This also holds for respiratory patients who are housebound with high levels of morbidity and high requirements for community health services. COPD patients approaching EOL require, at a minimum, education on diagnosis and disease process, available treatment modalities, what they have to do and what to expect, and information on prognosis. Despite this, only 32 % of respiratory patients report discussing EOL cares with their physicians [120] . Stated barriers in this study included, \"I would rather concentrate on staying alive than talk about death\" or \"I'm not sure which doctor will be taking care of me if I get very sick.\" Thus, it is necessary to identify areas of communication that physicians do not address and areas that patients rate poorly, including talking about prognosis, dying and spirituality.",

During hospitalisation, 74.4 % of patients had been admitted to an ICU and 27 % received resuscitation manoeuvres.

In particular, caregivers require major assistance during the delicate times of discussing advance care planning and directives and critical treatments decisions. Clinicians are, therefore, an important target group for education on this type of communication. The Calgary-Cambridge model for medical consultations and the SPIKES (Setting up, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Emotions, Strategy and Summary) [124] for breaking \"bad news\" provides examples of consultation guides that integrate patient agenda with biomedical issues. Communication of advance care planning, defined as an ongoing discussion among patients and family members may be a more effective mean to meet patients' wishes.",
