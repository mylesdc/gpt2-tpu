The replication of STMV depends on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by TMV U5, which has since been renamed Tobacco mild green mosaic virus. Other strains of TMV such as U1 and U2 also have been shown to support the replication of STMV 1 . The genome of STMV is composed of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 1059 nucleotides (nt) 2,3 . STMV RNA does not show appreciable sequence homology with helper TMV RNA, except for the 3\u2032 -terminal 150 nt that exhibit 65% homology with the corresponding tRNA-like structure (TLS) located at the 3\u2032 end of TMV RNA 2 . Biologically active icosahedral virions of STMV are 17-18 nm in diameter with a T = 1 symmetry 4 and are assembled from 60 identical capsid protein (CP) subunits of 17.5 kDa 2 .

In the current study, we extended the agroinfiltration system to further shed light on the contribution of the CP, more specifically the N-terminal 13aa motif, to STMV replication. We have engineered a series of mutations affecting the positively charged amino acids located within the N-terminal 13aa motif and evaluated their effect on replication and packaging. Application of a wide range of molecular techniques revealed that replication and packaging are regulated by protein-protein (i.e. CP and HV-RdRp) and protein-RNA-protein (i.e. HV-RdRp-STMV RNA-CP) interactions. First, we found that, the N-terminal 13aa motif has a regulatory role in STMV replication. Second, the genomic context of the N-13aa motif has a profound influence in modulating (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strand accumulation. Third, a single positively charged arginine residue located at the third position in the N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP is obligatory for the interaction between CP and HV-RdRp. Fourth, a Far-Northwestern analysis revealed that CP is obligatory to promote interaction between HV-RdRp and STMV RNA (i.e. a protein-protein-RNA interaction). Finally, we observed that STMV CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 specifically are defective in packaging full-length STMV genomic RNA. This study shows that packaging and replication of STMV RNA are regulated by the N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP.",

Among these 25 aa, the first 13aa are rich in basic residues and are predicted to interact with RNA inside the assembled capsid 10 . Application of DisProt 11 predicted that the N-terminal 25 aa region is disordered while the remaining 134 aa are highly ordered (Fig. 1B) . Preliminary data on the replication of STMV in plant protoplasts suggested a role for STMV CP and more specifically for the N-terminal13aa in replication 7 . We opted to extend the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system (agroinfiltration) developed recently for STMV in our lab 9 in dissecting the mechanism involving the CP-regulated STMV replication. To this end, we constructed three independent variant agrotransformants of wt STMV (pSTMV; Fig. 1C ). These are as follows: (i) Agrotransformant CPKO was constructed by substituting the translation initiating methionine codon located at nucleotides 162-164 with a stop codon (i.e. 162 AUG 164 \u2192 162 UAG 164 ) (Fig. 1C) ; (ii) agrotransformant CP\u0394 13aa was designed to express the CP devoid of the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at the translation initiation site and a start codon at aa14 (Fig. 1C) and (iii) agrotransformant CP13aa was designed to express only the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at aa position 14 (Fig. 1C) .",

Plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls. At five days post infiltration (dpi), total RNA and protein preparations were isolated and subjected respectively to duplicate Northern blot hybridization to detect progeny (+ ) and (\u2212 )-RNA and Western blot analysis. Duplicate Northern blots probed for assessing the affect of CP on the accumulation of progeny (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strands are shown in Fig. 2A . Quantitative analysis of progeny RNA with respect to the wt control is tabulated and shown in Fig. 2B . This experiment was repeated three times and we consistently observed that the presence of CP, more specifically the N-terminal 13aa, had profound influence on progeny accumulation. Quantitative data in Fig. 2B represents the relative (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strand accumulation for each CP mutant when compared internally to that of wt. It was observed that, complete absence of CP, exemplified by the behavior of CPKO, decreased the plus-strand accumulation by 90% while minus-strand accumulation was not affected. By contrast, CP lacking the N-terminal 13aa motif (i.e. CP\u0394 13aa) reduced the plus-strand accumulation by 47% while a 3-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed. Interestingly, expression of only the N-terminal 13aa motif had no detectable effect on plus-strand accumulation while a 4-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed (Fig. 2B ). Taken together, these results suggested that the N-terminal 13aa motif of the STMV CP has two independent roles for regulating (\u2212 ) and/or (+ )-strand synthesis (see Discussion). With respect to CP accumulation, as expected, in addition to the wt control, a detectable level of a faster migrating CP was accumulated for variant \u0394 13aa but not for other variants ( Fig. 2A) . To detect the 13aa motif by Western blot, the 13aa motif was FLAG tagged and its expression was confirmed by using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (see below) .",

            "text": "Recently, we demonstrated that production of a truncated form of STMV RNA is a hallmark feature associated with STMV replication in N. benthamiana 9 . It was observed that with either mechanical inoculation of STMV with its HV or co-expression of STMV with HV-RdRp via agroinfiltration, a truncated non-replicative form of STMV lacking the 3\u2032 terminal 150 nt (i.e. STMV\u0394 150) was also accumulated along with the wt genomic RNA. Additional experiments demonstrated that production of STMV\u0394 150 is linked to HV-dependent replication and is not a product of ribonuclease activity 9 . To verify the production of STMV\u0394 150 in leaves expressing each of the three variant agrotransformants (CPKO, \u2206 13aa and 13aa), total RNA preparations were subjected to RT-PCR. Production of STMV\u0394 150 was associated with either wt STMV ( Fig. 2A , lane 1 in RT-PCR panel) or a variant competent to express the 13aa (i.e. CP 13aa in Fig. 2A , lane 5 in RT-PCR panel) but not with those variants defective in expressing the 13aa i.e. CPKO or CP\u0394 13aa ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3 and 4 in RT-PCR panel). Since the production of STMV\u0394 150 is linked to HV-dependent replication 9 and the fact that expression of the 13aa plays a crucial role in STMV replication (Figs 2A and 3B ) 7 , these observations suggest that expression of the 13aa is linked to the production of STMV\u0394 150 by an unknown mechanism.",

Plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls while those infiltrated only with empty vector served as negative controls. At 4 dpi, virions were purified, negatively stained and examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Icosahedral virions of 18 nm characteristic of STMV were recovered from leaves infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP (Fig. 2C ). By contrast, no virions were detected in leaves infiltrated with any of the three CP variants (Fig. 2C ). In agreement with previous findings 5 , our observations further confirm that the N-terminal 13aa region is required for virion assembly. and minus (\u2212 ) strand progeny RNA and CP were respectively probed by Northern and Western blot analysis. RT-PCR assays of wt STMV and the indicated CP variants were performed using total RNA isolated from leaves harvested at 4 dpi. (B) Quantitative analysis of (+ ) and (\u2212 ) progeny RNA of wt STMV and each CP variant was performed by scanning the autoradiographs using a Typhoon Phosphoimage scanner (Model 9410, GE Health Care) followed by ImageQ software analysis. Data was quantitated and compared internally with each levels of (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strands to that of wild type. Conditions for Northern and Western blots and RT-PCR analysis are as described previously 9 Results shown in Fig. 2A accentuate the importance of the N-terminal 13aa region in STMV replication. To precisely identify the role of positively charged aa encompassing the N-terminal 13aa of STMV CP on replication, an alanine residue was substituted singly for each arginine or lysine residues normally located within the N-terminal 13aa motif resulting in the construction of a set of five variants of CP 13aa (i.e. 13aa/3A, 13aa/5A, 13aa/7A, 13aa/10A and 13aa/11A in Fig. 3A ). Each of these CP agrotranformants was co-infiltrated with pRP into N. benthamiana leaves and progeny were evaluated using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 3 ). Northern blots were probed for assessing the affect of CP and its variants on the progeny accumulation ( Fig. 3B ) and quantitated as described above (Fig. 3C) . First, we evaluated the affect of the N-terminal 13aa motif and five variants on plus-strand accumulation (Fig. 3B , panel i). Except for variant 13aa/3A, plus-strand accumulation for the remaining four variants was indistinguishable from that of the internal control (i.e. wt) (Fig. 3C ). Secondly, we evaluated the effect of these mutants on minus-strand accumulation (Fig. 3B , panel ii). Since each of the five alanine substitutions were engineered into the genetic background of the wt 13aa construct, data was normalized against wt 13aa. Except for variant 13aa/3A, where the (\u2212 )-strand accumulation was equivalent to that of the control (i.e. 13aa), a 3-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed for the remaining four variants (Fig. 3C ). Taken together, these observations accentuate the significance of having a positively charged residue at their respective positions, and specifically that the 3 rd position is obligatory for sustained replication.",

Among the four variants, CP production was more prominent with variant 7A than others (Fig. 4E ). By contrast, CP for variant 3A was only detectable when a 10-fold excess of total protein was loaded (Fig. 4F ). To verify whether these variants were competent to assemble into virions or virion like particles (VLPs), virions were purified from infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves. Figure 5 summarizes the results. EM and Northern blot hybridization evaluated the physical morphology of purified virions and their packaging phenotypes, respectively. The biological nature of the purified virions was tested by an infectivity assay. Results are summarized in Fig. 5 . Icosahedral virions of 18 nm were detected in wt as well as in variants 5A, 7A, 10A and 11A but not in variant 3A (Fig. 5A) . Northern blot analysis of virion RNA profiles revealed interesting results. For example, only virions of wt contained full-length STMV RNA as well as truncated STMV (i.e. STMV \u0394 150) (Fig. 5B, lane 6) , a characteristic feature of STMV in N. benthamiana 9 . By contrast, virions of all four variants contained only the truncated STMV \u0394 150 but not full length (Fig. 5B, lanes 2-5) . Presence of full length and STMV \u0394 150 in virion preparations of wt and the absence of full length and presence of STMV \u0394 150 in all four CP variants were further confirmed by an RT-PCR assay (Fig. 5C) . In contrast to the wt control (Fig. 5D, lane 1) , the inability to induce infection in N. benthamiana plants mechanically inoculated with virions of HV and each of the four CP variants (Fig. 5D, lanes 2-6) further confirm that CP variants are incompetent to package full length STMV RNA. Reasons for this defective packaging phenotype are considered under the Discussion.",

One set of N. benthamiana plants was infiltrated to co-express HV-RdRp (i.e. pRP, Fig. 1C ) and either wt STMV (i.e. pSTMV) or one of three selected N-terminal CP variants (3A, 5A and 7A). Another set of N. benthamiana plants was infiltrated to co-express pRP and only 13aa tagged with FLAG (13aa c-FLAG ). Plants co-infiltrated with P19 and either pSTMV or 13aa c-FLAG served as controls. At 4 dpi, total protein was extracted from infiltrated leaves and incubated with anti-126 kDa antibodies, followed by the precipitation of the complex with protein G-agarose beads and Western blotting with anti-126 kDa, CP or Anti-FLAG antibodies. Results are shown in Fig. 6A . It was observed that wt CP, variants 5A and 7A, but not 3A, were co-precipitated with HV-RdRp (i.e. Anti-126 kDa) (Fig. 6A, panel ii) . These results validate that a direct or indirect interaction exists between HV-RdRp and STMV CP and the arginine residue located at position 3 is obligatory in promoting this interaction.

            "text": "Viral replication is a complex process involving numerous macromolecular interactions 12 . In positive strand RNA viruses, although replication is primarily catalyzed by virus encoded RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp), several lines of evidence suggest that CP is intimately associated with this active process to stimulate replication 12 . For example, CP-regulated viral RNA synthesis occurs via CP-RNA interactions as in the case of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) 13, 14 or CP-RdRp interactions as in the case of member viruses of the Coronaviridae 15 and rubella virus 16 or CP functioning as an RNA chaperone 11, 17, 18 . The results presented here demonstrate that a cooperative interaction between HV-RdRp and STMV CP ( Fig. 2A) , more specifically the N-terminal 13aa region (Figs 3  and 4) , plays an important role in STMV replication and packaging. Mutational analysis further revealed that a positively charged residue at the third position in the N-terminal 13aa motif (Figs 3B, 4B,D and 6A) promotes the interaction between HV-RdRp and STMV CP. These features are commonly shared with AMV 14,19 and rubella virus 16 . In AMV, minus-strand synthesis requires the viral RNA to be in a 3\u2032 pseudoknot conformation and to be free of CP; upon CP binding a conformational switch blocks minus-strand synthesis and favors plus-strand synthesis 20, 21 . However, since the 3\u2032 UTR of STMV inherently mimics a TLS, a conformational switch analogous to AMV is not required to initiate minus-strand synthesis. Similar levels of minus-strand accumulation between wt and the CP defective variant CPKO (Fig. 2A, compare lanes1 and 3) suggest that in STMV minus-strand synthesis by HV-RdRp is independent of the CP.",

First, the critical role played by the CP is exemplified when the replication profile of wt and mutant CPKO is compared (Fig. 2A) . Since the levels of (\u2212 )-strand accumulation for wt and mutant CPKO are indistinguishable ( Fig. 2A, compare lanes  1 and 3) . It is reasonable to conclude that CP has no detectable effect on (\u2212 )-strand synthesis and a significant reduction in (+ )-strand synthesis by mutant CPKO (Fig. 2A, lane 3) suggests CP plays a critical role in (+ )-strand synthesis.",

This suggests that the role of the N-terminal 13aa motif is attributed to (+ ) strand synthesis. However, on mutating four of the five positively charged amino acids to alanine in the wt 13aa (i.e. 5A, 7A, 10A and 11A), the balanced accumulation of (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strand RNA was altered resulting in increased accumulation of (\u2212 )-strands (Fig. 3B) . Interestingly, this scenario was changed when the above-mentioned four mutants were incorporated into the background of full length CP. This is exemplified by increased accumulation of (+ )-strands over the (\u2212 )-strands (Fig. 4B) . Collectively, these observations suggest that (+ ) and (\u2212 )-strand accumulation is regulated by the context of the N-terminal 13aa motif.",

An analogous scenario was observed in AMV. Mutational analysis of the N-terminal basic residue of AMV CP revealed that substitution of alanine for lysine at position 18 completely abolished replication 19 .

Many in vitro viral self-assembly studies show that RNA packaging can be largely explained through electrostatic interactions 24 . Based on these experimental observations, we recently introduced a very simple generic model to study the spontaneous encapsulation of the genome by the CP 30 . In this model, we consider RNA as a negatively charged polymer interacting attractively with positively charged CP. More specifically, we use a phenomenological model to investigate the total free energy of the virion, F virion = F capsid + F RNA + F int , with F capsid the free energy of the capsid, F int the free energy associated with capsid-RNA interactions and F RNA the free energy of RNA. Since STMV CP is positively charged, we model the capsid as a charged sphere so the term F capsid involves the repulsive electrostatic interaction between positive charges on the CP. In our approach, RNA is modeled as a self-avoiding flexible branched chain. Thus the term F RNA includes the contribution of RNA entropy, the secondary structure of RNA, and the excluded volume interaction related to the second viral coefficient. We find the optimal length of RNA and its distribution within the capsid through minimization of the free energy F virion explained above.",

            "text": "Data shown in Fig. 8 demonstrates the result of our calculations, F virion vs genome length. The \u03c3 in the figure corresponds to the charge density of the inner wall of the capsid. It is 0.24 electron/nm 2 for the capsid constructed by mutated coat proteins (5A, 7A, 10A and 11A) and it is 0.3 electron/nm 2 for the wt capsid. The solid black curve shows the free energy of RNA encapsulated by wt proteins while the dashed red curves correspond to that by the mutated coat proteins. Blue dots and orange squares respectively represent the encapsidation free energy of STMV\u0394 150 (908 nt) and wt RNA (1058 nt). As illustrated in the figure, in the case of the mutated capsid, the encapsidation free energy of STMV\u0394 150 RNA is significantly lower than that of wt RNA (14.28k B T) leading to the exclusive encapsulation of STMV\u0394 150 RNA. However, in the case of wt CP, the encapsulation free energy of STMV\u0394 150 RNA is lower than that of wt RNA by only1.47k B T, explaining why both STMV\u0394 150 and wt RNA can be encapsidated by wt CP. As a matter of fact, while the ratio of free STMV\u0394 150 to wt RNA is very low (24:76) 9 , the ratio of packaged STMV\u0394 150 to wt RNA is much larger (55:45) indicating a clear preference for encapsidation of the shorter RNA. More specifically, these calculations reveal that the electrostatic interaction between mutated capsid proteins and full length RNA is not strong enough to compact the genome to fit in a small size capsid. In other words, due to the size of the STMV capsid, the energetic cost of encapsidation of negatively charged wt RNA is very high and thus the shorter genome is encapsidated more favorably even by wt capsid proteins. While the number of charges on the wt capsid proteins are sufficient to encapsidate the full length genome, it is important to note that wt RNA gets encapsidated much less efficiently than STMV\u0394 150 RNA. These theoretical results offer the basis to explain results presented in Fig. 5C .",

However, a question that naturally arises would be why does the CP bearing the 3A mutation not encapsulate either STMV\u0394 150 or wt RNA? We offer the following explanation. Our observations (Fig. 5C ) suggest that non-specific interactions are insufficient to drive the self-assembly of a ssRNA virus by CP. The presence of an arginine residue located at position 3 reveals the necessity of a specific interaction between RNA and CP for the successful assembly of a virion. The interaction could be due to a specific nucleation site on the CP for RNA or the specific CP-RNA interaction could alter the conformation of the CP resulting in a stronger protein-protein interaction leading to virion assembly. The experiments presented in this paper show that an amino acid residue (i.e. arginine) at a specific site (i.e. position 3) is crucial for successful packaging. Identification and disruption of contacts between particular CP residues and RNA could contribute to our knowledge of developing novel antiviral drug strategies for RNA viruses pathogenic to pathogenic to humans and animals.",

Characteristic features of agroconstructs pRP and pSTMV were described previously 9 . CPKO, an STMV CP variant is characterized by having a 162 UAG 164 stop codon in the place of an 162 AUG 164 start codon. CP variant CP\u0394 13aa was engineered to express CP lacking the N-terminal 13aa motif due to the presence of a stop codon between nt 162-164 ( 162 UAG 164) and a start codon between nt 200-202 ( 200 AUG 202 ). CP variant CP13aa is engineered to express only the N-terminal 13aa motif by having a stop codon at amino acid position 14 located between nt 200-202 ( 200 UAG 202 ). Each agroconstruct contains in sequential order (L to R), double Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoters (indicated by arrowheads), a ribozyme (R, indicated by a bent arrow) derived from Tobacco ring spot virus (TRSV) and a NOS terminator (T).

Interaction between STMV RNA and CPs of wt, variants 5A and 7A, but not with either CPKO or variant 3A, was detectable [Fig. 7A, panel (ii)]. These Northwestern analyses confirm interaction between CP and RNA while Co-IP assays (Fig. 6A) established that CP interacts with HV-RdRp. To further evaluate whether CP is required to promote interaction between STMV RNA and HV-RdRp, we performed another Far-Northwestern analysis. Results demonstrated that the presence of STMV CP enabled the interaction between HV-RdRp and STMV RNA [Fig. 7B, panels (I to iii)]. Taken together these results provide evidence that CP enhances selection of STMV RNA templates by HV-RdRp.",
