To date, not many studies have been reported on the identification of suitable reference genes in buffaloes. The present study was undertaken to determine the panel of suitable reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Briefly, MEC culture from buffalo mammary gland was exposed to 42 \u2218 C for one hour and subsequently allowed to recover at 37 \u2218 C for different time intervals (from 30 m to 48 h). Three different algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper softwares, were used to evaluate the stability of 16 potential reference genes from different functional classes. Our data identified RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 genes to be the most appropriate reference genes that could be utilized for normalization of qPCR data in heat-stressed buffalo MECs.",

This is generally attributed to their specific morphological, anatomical, and behavioural characteristics [1] . The effect of heat stress on mammary epithelial cell (MEC), the major cell type in lactating mammary gland, could be one of the prime factors responsible for lower milk production in animals. Understanding of expression profile of these cells from different livestock species during different physiological stages would provide molecular basis of heat stress specific transcriptomic response of mammary gland. Recently, few efforts [2, 3] have been made to unravel the transcriptional response of mammary gland to heat stress condition; still, the molecular mechanism of such responses are thought to be too complex to understand. qPCR is a common tool to determine the expression level of any target gene; for accurate quantification of expression level, there is a need to identify the appropriate reference genes under the particular experimental setup. Such approaches are helping a great deal to normalize the real time data for reliable interpretation of expression studies in different species [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In earlier studies, researchers have relied mostly on GAPDH, ACTB, and RS18 as suitable reference genes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, Vandesompele et al. and Bustin et al. had shown that use of single reference gene can lower the reliability of expression data and strongly advocated use of multiple reference genes for each experimental setup [10, 12] .",

These reports suggested that expression levels of commonly used reference genes vary considerably between different tissues and experimental conditions. Such variations reported in different studies [10, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] indicated that there cannot be set universal reference genes for all tissues or experimental conditions, and hence there is a need for identification of tissue specific stably expressed genes [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Environmental heat stress affects the mammary gland that results in low milk production or truncated milk production. Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are responsible for converting most precursors into milk constituents and transporting them to the mammary lumen, the first line that gets affected by heat stress. As MEC ares the predominant cell types in lactating mammary gland, changes in their genes expression could provide an insight of the mammary gland mechanism. The present study was therefore undertaken to identify a panel of appropriate reference genes for normalization of transcriptional data of heat-stressed buffalo MECs. A total of 16 known reference genes, namely, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), betaactin (ACTB), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), ribosomal protein S15A (RPS15A), beta 2-microglobulin (B2M), alpha 2-microglobulin (A2M), ribosomal protein L-4 (RPL4), ribosomal proteinS18 (RS18), ribosomal protein L-22 (RPL22), ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase1 (HPRT1), GTP-binding protein (GTP), eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1), and ubiquitin C (UBC) belonging to different functional categories, were evaluated (Table 1 ).",

To check the sequence specificity, primers were aligned against publicly available databases at NCBI and UCSC's Cow (Bos taurus) genome browser gateway using BLASTN. Prior to qPCR, primer specificity was further confirmed in a 20 L PCR reaction using the same protocol described for qPCR except for the final dissociation protocol.

All candidate genes performed well displaying values below the accepted limit of 1.5. The genes were ranked from the most stable (lowest value) to the least stable(highest value): RPL4, (Figure 2) . Additionally, pairwise variation termed as \"V value\" was also calculated to determine the optimal Determination of the optimal number of control genes for normalization Figure 3 : Determination of optimal number of reference genes for normalization by calculation of pairwise variation ( ) of normalization factor ratios for different number of genes. number of genes necessary to calculate normalization factor. As suggested by Vandesompele et al., genes showing V value below the cutoff limit of 0.15 were selected as optimal number of genes for normalization [10] . In this analysis, we started with the two most stably expressed genes and then sequentially included less stably expressed genes. The lower the pairwise variation the better the combination of genes is. From this perspective, the V value was also calculated by adding the third and fourth less stable genes, that is, 3/ 4 and 4/ 5 combinations. The contribution of each gene to the variance of normalization factor ratio was calculated to illustrate the effect of adding or removing a particular gene from the final set of reference genes. Our result showed that a combination of the two most stable genes (RPL4 and EEF1A1) gave V value of 0.037 which is well within the acceptable limit ( Figure 3) . Similar approach has been used in a number of other studies to find out the suitable housekeeping genes [16, 19, 20, 36] . However, as the aim in such studies is to achieve an overall variation of less than 0.15 with minimum number of genes, EEF1A1 and RPL4 gene-combination could be appropriate to normalize the target genes expression in heat-stressed buffalo MECs.

In addition, intergene relation for the 10 most stable reference gene pairs was also estimated. The highly correlated reference genes were combined into BestKeeper index, and the correlation between each reference gene and BestKeeper was analyzed. The Pearson correlation coefficient ( ), coefficient of determination ( 2 ), and the values were estimated to describe the correlation between reference genes and BestKeeper index ( Table 6 ). The best correlation was observed for RPS9 ( = 0.983) and RPS23 ( = 0.840) followed by EEF1A1, RPL4, HMBS, and UXT with values of 0.679, 0.567, and 0.565, respectively.

In this study, our focus was to identify suitable reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo MECs as no such information is available in buffaloes. The findings of the present study will be a step forward to initiate transcriptional studies in this important dairy species of Indian subcontinent. The present analysis using different statistical applications clearly revealed a panel of the most stable reference genes (RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23) at different time points under heat-stressed condition of buffalo MECs. Our results for ranking of the most stable reference genes utilizing these different algorithms were quite comparable, albeit not identical. Similar to our findings, RPL4 was also reported to be one of the most suitable genes in multiple tissues, namely, udder, muscle, liver, and kidney of water buffalo [37] . On the other hand, our results showed unstable expression with respect to the most commonly used reference genes, for example, ACTB and GAPDH. In the past, investigators have relied mostly on GAPDH, ACTB, and RPS18 as reference genes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Historically, GAPDH and ACTB genes have been used quite frequently as single control gene in more than 90% of the studies [21] and were considered good references for many years. But in the recent past, the expression of these reference genes has been shown to be affected by experimental condition [30, 38] . Several other studies have also shown variation in their transcription level [10, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] making them unsuitable for transcriptional studies. Proper evaluation of these two reference genes in any cell type or tissue of interest is therefore mandatory for correct interpretation of qPCR results.",

Overall, RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 were selected to be the three most stable reference genes for normalization of gene expression data in heat-stressed buffalo MECs under in-vitro conditions. Vandesompele et al. [10] and Bower and Johnston [39] have also recommended the use of geometric average of the most stable reference genes for accurate normalization of qPCR data. As this is the first paper on testing the reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo MECs, our analyses were restricted to some of the well-known housekeeping genes reported in other livestock species. In conclusion, RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 are the best reference genes for heat-stressed studies in buffalo MECs, and their geometric means would provide accurate normalization factor. For other experimental settings involving buffalo MECs, the use of these reference genes may be carefully evaluated as their expression may change in other specific experimental conditions. However, the panel reference genes identified in the present study would certainly be useful for accurate normalization of buffalo MECs expression data during heat challenge experiments. ",
