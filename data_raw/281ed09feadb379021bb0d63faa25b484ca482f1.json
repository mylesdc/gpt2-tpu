PTSD can damage functional capacity and interfere with social functioning. However, little is known about recovery from PTSD after floods. This study used 2013-2014 follow-up data on survivors of the 1998 Dongting Lake flood who were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up and identify predictors of recovery from the PTSD diagnosis in 2000.",

A total of 19.4 % of the flood survivors with PTSD in 2000 continued to suffer from PTSD in 2013-2014. In the multivariable logistic regression model, individuals who had lost relatives (OR = 12.37, 95 % CI = 2.46-62.16), suffered from bodily injury (OR = 5.01, 95 % CI = 1.92-13.08), had a low level of social support (OR = 5.47, 95 % CI = 1.07-27.80), or had a negative coping style (OR = 4.92, 95 % CI = 1.89-12.81) were less likely to recover from PTSD. Conclusions: The prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up indicates that natural disasters such as floods may have a negative influence on survivors' mental health for an extended period of time. Individuals who have lost relatives, suffered from bodily injury, had a low level of social support, or had a negative coping style were less likely to recover from PTSD. Therefore, effective psychological intervention measures are necessary for facilitating the recovery process from PTSD, especially for individuals with adverse prognostic factors.",

            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder caused by unusual threats or catastrophic events. According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), PTSD consists of four clusters of symptoms, namely, intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyper-arousal [1] . PTSD can damage functional capacity and interfere with social functioning [2] . Hidalgo's study showed that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population was approximately 1 to 9 % [3] . More generally, individuals with PTSD may experience a long recovery process after traumatic events [4] . For example, James found that half of the police officers with PTSD after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks-with a diagnosis made between 2003 and 2007 continued to have PTSD in 2011-2012 [5] . Additionally, according to a Chinese study, one-third of convalescent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients with PTSD in 2003 were reported to have PTSD after the 4year follow-up [6] . However, different traumatic events may result in different PTSD rates and different PTSD prognoses. Currently, research on PTSD has mainly focused on the incidence of PTSD or the risk factors of chronic PTSD after traumatic events such as earthquakes [7] and wars [8] . Studies on PTSD experienced after floods, let alone addressing the predictive factors of PTSD recovery after floods, are limited [9] .",

According to some studies, the PCL-C has high internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.94) [20] , with relatively high levels of sensitivity (94-97 %) and specificity (86-99 %) [21] . Moreover, research has shown that the Chinese version of the PCL-C has sound validity and reliability [22] . The PCL-C consists of 17 items that are split into three domains, namely, re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal. Among the 17 items, all items referring to re-experiencing, half of the items referring to avoidance, and half of the items referring to hyperarousal contained event-specific wording (e.g., \"\u2026as a result of the Dongting Lake flood in 1998\"). The scale of each of the 17 items ranges from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). In this study, a score of 44 was used as a cutoff to identify PTSD at follow-up. The diagnostic efficiency of these criteria was 0.94 [21] . Participants were classified into two groups. The first group was the group that fulfilled the criteria for PTSD diagnosis during the follow-up period, while the second group was the group that met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the 2000 survey, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the follow-up.",

This prevalence rate emphasizes the importance of early identification of risk for longterm PTSD, which has been previously suggested [25] [26] [27] . Few studies have investigated PTSD in the long term or beyond 15 years [28, 29] . Among these studies, one showed that 7 % of Buffalo Creek flood survivors had a PTSD diagnosis at the 17-year follow-up [28] . In another study, 29 % of Aberfan disaster survivors met PTSD diagnostic criteria at the 33-year follow-up [29] . Additional research, with shorter longitudinal follow-up times, has found, for example, PTSD prevalence rates of 53 % among 9/11 police responders at the 5-year followup and PTSD prevalence rates of 34.3 % among SARS patients in 2000 at the 4-year follow-up [5, 6] . It is wellknown that the type of traumatic event and the intensity of disasters may influence PTSD prevalence rates among survivors [15] . Moreover, follow-up time may also affect the PTSD prevalence rate. Longer follow-up time may provide survivors with sufficient time to recover from the trauma and, therefore, could result in a lower PTSD prevalence rate at follow-up.",

In this study, flood survivors who developed PTSD after the flood and had experienced loss of relatives or physical injury were less likely to recover from PTSD compared with their PTSD counterparts who did not experience loss of relatives or physical injury. In addition to this finding, a previous study showed that loss of relatives and physical injury were risk factors for the onset of PTSD after traumatic events [30] . Therefore, traumarelated stressors may not only be related to the onset of PTSD but may also be associated with PTSD recovery. Among the Chinese, for example, whether a family is cohesive plays an important role in one's mental health, and kinship is the centre of the social network. Therefore, experiencing loss of relatives, especially a spouse or parents, may be particularly stressful for Chinese citizens. Additionally, the quality of life of individuals who have experienced bodily injury from the flood may be seriously affected by pain or disability brought about by the disaster. Therefore, it may be more difficult for them to recover from PTSD. Social support refers to the quality and function of social relationships, and may have an effect on the way one copes with stress [31] . In this study, a high level of social support was found to be a predictor of PTSD recovery in flood survivors. This is in agreement with a previous study that found that social resources can provide a buffer against psychological distress following potentially traumatic events [32] . Moreover, social support also correlates with the onset of PTSD [33] . Our study found that social support was correlated with PTSD recovery. Therefore, it is important to provide more social resources to individuals who have experienced trauma, as these resources may have long-term impacts in alleviating the psychological effects caused by traumatic events.",

The results of the present study showed that females were less likely to recover from prior PTSD in univariable analysis, but being female proved not to be an independent predictor of recovery from prior PTSD in the multivariabe analysis. Moreover, the effects of education level and age on the incidence of PTSD are controversial [40, 44, 45] , and the results of this study indicated that neither variable was significantly related to PTSD recovery in flood survivors.",

For example, at follow-up 7-8 years after September 11, 2001 with the police officers who experienced the events, James found that 41.0 % had at least 2 life-threatening stressors since the terror attack [5] . In our study, 22.4 % of the participants reported post-flood stressors at a longer follow-up period than that in James' study. This is mainly because the post-flood stressors indicated in this study included an assessment of the number of stressful life events and a rating of how terrified the person felt by each event. Thus, the rate of individuals who reported having both stressful life events (e.g., traffic accidents, cancers, loss of a relative, etc.) and feeling terrified (e.g., reexperiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal) may be decreased. However, this study found that post-flood stressors were not significantly associated with recovery from PTSD, although previous studies have indicated that post-disaster stressors or stressful life events were related to the psychological outcome of individuals following traumatic events [5, 46] .",

The reason for the lack of a significant relationship between them could be attributed to the fact that the post-flood stressors identified in this study were measured after a 13-14 year gap since the year 2000. This reasoning is supported by Perez, who found that the number of trauma exposures were a predictor of a worse course of PTSD, but only during some intervals in the 15-year follow-up period [47] . Therefore, it is possible that post-flood stressors and recovery from PTSD might be significantly correlated at the time when the participants were exposed to the post-flood stressors, but not when the follow-up study was conducted.",

Firstly, the impact of income could not be analyzed because most of the participants did not want to provide information about their income. Secondly, fluctuations of PTSD symptoms over time were not assessed. Thirdly, participants who enrolled in this study were likely to have a chronic course since they were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000, almost 2 years after the Dongting Lake flood. Thus, the prevalence of PTSD at the 13-14 year follow-up may be overestimated. Finally, all participants of this study were Chinese of Han Ethnicity. Hence, the results may not be applicable to flood survivors in other populations.",

The prevalence rate of PTSD among this group at the 13-14 year follow-up since the diagnosis of PTSD in 2000 was 19.4 %. Traumatic events such as floods may negatively affect survivors for a long period of time. Individuals who lost relatives due to the flood, suffered from bodily injury, had a low level of social support, or had a negative coping style after the flood were less likely to recover from PTSD. Therefore, with little or no psychological intervention following trauma, approximately one in five individuals diagnosed with PTSD at 2 years post-event will continue to experience severe PTSD symptoms, even 15 years later. More research is needed to design and evaluate early interventions following disasters, particularly for those with increased vulnerability. ",
