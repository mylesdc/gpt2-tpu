            "text": "Campylobacter jejuni remains one of the major gut pathogens of our time. Its zoonotic nature and wide-spread distribution in industrialized countries calls for a quick and reliable diagnostic tool. Antibody-based detection presents a suitable means to identify pathogenic bacteria. However, the knowledge about immunodominant targets is limited. Thus, an approach is presented, which allows for the rapid screening of numerous cDNA derived expression clones to identify novel antigens. The deeper understanding of immunodominant proteins assists in the design of diagnostic tools and furthers the insight into the bacterium's pathogenicity as well as revealing potential candidates for vaccination. We have successfully screened 1536 clones of an expression library to identify 22 proteins that have not been described as immunodominant before. After subcloning the corresponding 22 genes and expression of full-length proteins, we investigated the immunodominant character by microarrays and ELISA. Subsequently, seven proteins were selected for epitope mapping. For cj0669 and cj0920c linear epitopes were identified. For cj0669, specificity assays revealed a specific linear epitope site. Consequently, an eleven amino acid residue sequence TLIKELKRLGI was analyzed via alanine scan, which revealed the glycine residue to be significant for binding of the antibody. The innovative approach presented herein of generating cDNAs of prokaryotes in combination with a microarray platform rendering time-consuming purification steps obsolete has helped to illuminate novel immunodominant proteins of C.jejuni. The findings of a specific linear epitope pave the way for a plethora of future research and the potential use in diagnostic applications such as serological screenings. Moreover, the current approach is easily adaptable to other highly relevant bacteria making it a formidable tool for the future discovery of antigens and potential biomarkers. Consequently, it is desirable to simplify the identification of structural epitopes, as this would extend the spectrum of novel epitopes to be detected.",

            "text": "C. jejuni is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium possessing a helical-shaped morphology [1] . In industrialized countries, C. jejuni has been one of the primary causal agents of gastroenteritis. In 2012, in Germany alone 62626 cases have been reported [2] . Campylobacteriosis predominantly induces mild, self-limiting diarrhoea, however severe cases have been reported [3] . Several studies have shown the potential contribution of Campylobacteriosis in the development of neuropathies such as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [4, 5] . The prominent route of infection is the improper handling and insufficient cooking of poultry [6] . The broad distribution of this pathogen in combination with a high clinical relevance necessitates fast and reliable diagnosis. Although several genomic typing methods exist [7, 8] , these are often timeconsuming and inappropriate for a point-of-care application. Instead, a direct approach detecting the whole bacterium is beneficial. This can be achieved by using specific antibodies to membrane-associated antigens similar to the Latex-Agglutination-Test that is already available for several bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter [9] .",

Although methods exist to isolate mRNA from bacteria [20, 21] , it is generally considered to be more challenging as compared to eukaryotic RNA, where Oligo(dT) primers are sufficient [22] . Therefore, we refrained from isolating the mRNA prior to reverse transcription. Instead, the generated cDNA was normalized, i.e. trimmed down, afterwards by the use of a duplex-specific nuclease [23] . This approach has been shown to effectively reduce the amount of rRNA-derived molecules, thereby altering the overall composition in favour of the mRNAderived cDNA without including a bias [24] . Further optimization of library construction was achieved by using a ligationindependent cloning as well as electroporation, which have been shown to enhance overall cloning efficiency [25, 26] .",

These are located on the outer rim of the protein, hence easily accessible for antibody binding to occur. Although, the structural information is merely based on modelling, the z-values of this model fall within close proximity to zero (-0.88) commonly associated with x-ray crystallographic results [37] . Consequently, the probability of this model to match the real structure is high.

For C. jejuni the generation of monoclonal antibodies against cj0669 is mandatory to further investigate the affinity and kinetics of the observed binding event by BIAcore. This might grant further insight whether or not this sequence is a suitable candidate for specific detection in a biosensor or if cj0669 is a suitable vaccine candidate. Mutagenesis of cj0669 might help to illuminate the function of this protein and its potential role if any in pathogenicity. Once this is determined, a monoclonal antibody might be used to cocrystallize the antigen for X-ray crystallography to assign a measured structure to the predicted model.

After cDNA generation, normalization is performed to minimize the number of rRNA derived clones. Next, screening is performed using polyclonal antibodies and potentially immunogenic proteins are selected. The corresponding clones are sequenced and the genes and proteins identified, either by exact match (sequenced strain) or homology (clinical isolate). A set of candidate proteins is selected focusing only on previously unknown antigens, while known antigens are discarded. Immunodominant nature of each full-length protein is assessed by ELISA and microarray analyses to further narrow down the number of proteins to be tested via epitope mapping, if desired. Linear epitope mapping reveals potential antigenic sites, which are tested for specificity and in alanine scan.

From these normalized rfis a median and standard deviation was calculated. If the median normalized rfi of the positive control was below the median normalized rfi of any of the negative references whilst considering the standard deviations, the test was rendered invalid. If the test passed the above criterion, the Q values were calculated as follows:",

After addition of 7 mL 1x TBS (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. 2 ml of each reaction were removed, mixed with 8 ml of 5x loading buffer (Fermentas) and 1 ml DTT and heated for 5 min at 70uC. The separation was performed on a Mini-Protean TGX Gel (Biorad, any kD, 15 wells) in a Protean II xi Cell chamber (Biorad) for 30 min at 200 V.

Electropherogramm and RNA Integrity number (RIN) for sample 5, a total RNA isolated from C. jejuni NCTC 11168, after analysis using the RNA 6000 Pico kit and the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The RIN equals 9 and the ratio of 23S to 16S rRNA is 1.8. On the right hand, a virtual gel picture is presented as calculated by the Agilent Expert 2100 software. (TIF) Figure S2 LIKELKRLGI is conserved in C. jejuni. The protein sequence of Cj0669 was BLASTed and subsequently aligned according to a BLOSUM62 matrix. As a reference sequence TLIKELKRLGI of Q0PAK5, the protein encoded by cj0669 from C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was used. The dots indicate an agreement to the reference, while differences are given by the one letter amino acid code. The first 13 sequences including the references are 100% identical and are all derived from C. jejuni proteins. For other species of Campylobacter such as C. coli or C. upsaliensis several of the residues are replaced. For other organisms, especially Helicobacter pylori the degree of replaced residues increases. The positions showing the most conservation throughout are residues 3, 6, 9 and 11. However, residue 10, the glycine which was revealed to be paramount for the binding of the antibody is not found in Helicobacter pylori proteins. (PDF) Figure S10 Specific vs. non-specific binding to potential linear epitopes of cj0920c. The bars represent the mean values (n = 15) of rfi values after incubation with polyclonal antibody to C. jejuni (green) and Salmonella enterica (orange). The mean values for each peptide fall within the same range or possess overlapping standard deviations. Thus, no specific interaction of the antibody to the epitope is present; rather a non-specific binding seems likely. (TIF) Figure S11 Binding specificity assay of TLIKELKRLGI with anti-Salmonella antibodies. The different sequences tested in alanine scanning are shown in the box-whisker-plot (n = 15) with each box representing 50% of the values. The whiskers encompass 98% of the values, the median is indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a small rectangle. The 12 boxes in green on the left represent the results after incubation with polyclonal antibody to S. enterica. For comparison, the two red boxes show the original signals from Fig. 4 for the sequence TLIKELKRLGI as well as TLIKELKRLAI, after incubation with polyclonal antibodies to C. jejuni. All the green boxes fall into the same range as the altered sequence TLIKELKRLAI, where alanine replaced the glycine residue, which possessed only 10% intensity of the original sequence. Thus, no specific interaction of the antibody to the epitope is present; rather a non-specific binding seems likely. (TIF) Figure S12 Primers used in this study. The name of each primer, the corresponding target gene or vector and its sequence in 59 to 39 direction is given. For each gene, F represents the forward primer and R the reverse.

Error bars were calculated by propagation of uncertainty by Gauss. Peptides 44 and 45 of cj0669 show mean rfi values of approximately eight and six thousand A.U. respectively after incubation with polyclonal anti-Campylobacter antibodies. However, using E.coli antibodies the signals are almost gone amounting to less than 500 A.U. in rfi.

Each box represents 50% of the values, while 98% fall within the whiskers. The median is represented by a horizontal line within each box and the small rectangle corresponds to the mean of each sample. The original sequence TLIKELKRLGI shows a mean fluorescence intensity of about 10000 A.U. For most amino acids within this sequence, replacement by alanine has no to little effect. However, if glycine is replaced by alanine the peptide loses most of its binding activity, clearly seen by a drop of mean rfi to less than 1000 A.U. This equals a drop of more than 90% in intensity. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065837.g004",
