The 7a protein is present in the virus particle and has been shown to interact with several host proteins; thereby implicating it as being involved in several pathogenic processes including apoptosis, inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. In this study we present data demonstrating that the SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with human Ap 4 A-hydrolase (asymmetrical diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, EC 3.6.1.17). Ap 4 A-hydrolase is responsible for metabolizing the \"allarmone\" nucleotide Ap 4 A and therefore likely involved in regulation of cell proliferation, DNA replication, RNA processing, apoptosis and DNA repair. The interaction between 7a and Ap 4 A-hydrolase was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured human cells transiently expressing V5-His tagged 7a and HA tagged Ap 4 A-hydrolase. Human tissue culture cells transiently expressing 7a and Ap 4 A-hydrolase tagged with EGFP and Ds-Red2 respectively show these proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm.",

In addition, 7a can block cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase via the cyclin D3/pRb pathway [16] . Also, interaction between 7a and hSGT (human small glutamine-rich tetricopeptide repeat containing protein) has been demonstrated although the biological significance of this interaction needs to be further elucidated [17] .

            "text": "There is no consensus opinion in subcellular localization of 7a protein [for review see [11] ]. 7a protein was found co-locolaze with trans-Golgi marker, Golgin97 [9] , in the Golgi compartment [14] . Other reports demonstrated co-localization with endoplasmic reticulum marker GRP94 or the intermediate compartment marker Sec 31 [7, 17] . Since the co-immunoprecipitation experiment showed interaction between HA-tagged 7a and V5-tagged Ap 4 A-hydrolase, we hypothesized that these proteins may co-localize in human cells. To visualize these proteins, we tagged them with fluorescent proteins: 7a with EGFP and Ap 4 A-hydrolase with DsRed2. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-C2-ORF7a and pDsRed2-Ap 4 A, and sub-cellular distribution of proteins was examined by confocal microscopy.",

It is well established that over-expression of 7a protein in cultured cells induces apoptosis via increasing level of caspase-3 protease activity [13] . Interestingly, Ap 4 A is also involved in caspase activation [34] . Elevation of Ap 4 A level could be achieved by direct upregulation of the amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases, or down-regulation of the Ap 4 A-hydrolases, or both, in response to the appropriate signal. Our data indicate that 7a interacts with Ap 4 A-hydrolase and thus may down-regulate the Ap 4 A-hydrolase enzymatic activity. Theoretically, this would result in an increase of Ap 4 A level and contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Further study is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

As for 7a, it has been demonstrated that its expression inhibits phosphorylation of one of the key regulators of cell cycle progression -Rb protein [15] . The hyperphosphorylation of Rb allows activation of E2F family of transcription factors, permitting the transcription of the S phase genes [39] . The inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by 7a suggests that the expression of G1 cyclin/cdk complexes is suppressed. On the other hand, flow cytometric analysis indicated an involvement of Ap 4 A at an early stage of G1/S arrest by dephosphorylation of pRb via reduction of CDK 2 activity [36] .",

Further insight into the functions of both 7a protein and Ap 4 A-hydrolase will still have to be gained before the physiological importance of their interactions can be elucidated. In addition, more experiments are required to determine the significance of the obtained data. For instance, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays need to be repeated using SARS-CoV infected cells and protein-specific anti-sera. Also, it will be useful to infect cells with SARS-CoV carrying a deletion of the 7a gene [4] in order to study apoptosis and cell cycle regulation in the infected cells.",
