When expressed in isolation, CoV accessory proteins have been shown to interfere with innate antiviral signaling pathways. However, there is limited information on the specific contribution of MERS-CoV accessory protein 4b to the repression of the innate antiviral response in the context of infection. We found that MERS-CoV 4b was required to prevent a robust NF-\u03baB dependent response during infection. In wild-type virus infected cells, 4b localized to the nucleus, while NF-\u03baB was retained in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the absence of 4b or in the presence of cytoplasmic 4b mutants lacking a nuclear localization signal (NLS), NF-\u03baB was translocated to the nucleus leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This indicates that NF-\u03baB repression required the nuclear import of 4b mediated by a specific NLS. Interestingly, we also found that both in isolation and during infection, 4b interacted with \u03b1-karyopherin proteins in an NLS-dependent manner. In particular, 4b had a strong preference for binding karyopherin-\u03b14 (KPNA4), which is known to translocate the NF-\u03baB protein complex into the nucleus. Binding of 4b to KPNA4 during infection inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit. Thereby we propose a model where 4b outcompetes NF-\u03baB for KPNA4 binding and translocation into the nucleus as a mechanism of interference with the NF-\u03baB-mediated innate immune response.",

Virus accessory genes are potential contributors to pathology, possibly by interfering with the innate immune response. However, understanding their interactions with host proteins in the context of infection is rudimentary. Here, we provide evidence that the MERS-CoV accessory protein 4b functioned, at least in part, to prevent a robust NF-\u03baB dependent response during infection. This effect depended on the nuclear localization of 4b, which was associated with the cytoplasmic retention of NF-\u03baB. We show that 4b interacted with \u03b1-karyopherin proteins (importins) involved in the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB, inhibiting the binding of \u03b1-karyopherin to NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit. We propose that 4b contributes to the evasion of the innate immune response by binding \u03b1-karyopherin proteins, leading to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB nuclear transport.

Since then, 2100 confirmed cases and 730 deaths have been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of~36% (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 10-november-2017-mers-oman/en/). Currently, MERS-CoV remains a public health threat, as new infections continue to occur and no approved vaccines or antivirals are available. Furthermore, MERS-CoV is endemic in camels, making it likely that the virus will be an ongoing concern. Evidence from a number of studies has demonstrated that MERS-CoV strongly inhibits IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [1] [2] [3] , although our knowledge on how the virus interferes with the host antiviral response is still limited. The contribution of viral proteins to the inhibition of the innate antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses has been mainly addressed in cells overexpressing individual viral proteins, not in the context of virus infection.",

            "text": "The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of proteins are critical regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity [4] . In na\u00efve cells, NF-\u03baB proteins are present in the cytoplasm in association with inhibitory proteins (I\u03baBs). Cellular stimuli, including pathogens and stress, induce I\u03baB phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, releasing NF-\u03baB proteins and allowing their nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NF-\u03baB proteins promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, stress-response proteins, and anti-apoptotic proteins. NF-\u03baB activity is essential for lymphocyte survival and activation, and for initiating and propagating optimal immune responses. By contrast, the constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is often associated with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Exacerbated NF-\u03baB activity has been demonstrated to be important for the inflammatory immunopathology induced by respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [5, 6] and influenza A virus [7] . Here, we found that nuclear MERS-CoV 4b protein contributes to the inhibition of the host NF-\u03baB-mediated pro-inflammatory response by preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In addition, we identified karyopherin-\u03b14 (importin-\u03b13), which is responsible for the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB, as a 4b binding protein. We found that 4b binding to karyopherin-\u03b14 inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit, thus preventing NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and, as a consequence, expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. The ability of 4b to block NF-\u03baB is likely to be relevant for MERS-CoV-induced in vivo pathology and virulence.",

Viruses deleted in the accessory proteins, like the parental virus [3] , were unable to induce IFN (S1 Fig) in contrast to the effective induction of IFN-\u03b2 by poly(I:C) transfection, implying that additional proteins expressed by the virus act as IFN antagonists [9] . Interestingly, dual deletion of genes 4a and 4b led to a significant increase in the expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 as compared to the wild-type infection (S1 Fig). Since the transcription of these genes depends on NF-\u03baB [4] , these results suggested that one or both proteins repressed NF-\u03baB activation during MERS-CoV infection.",

The 4a and 4b genes have overlapping coding sequences and are expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA, and thus 4b is likely expressed by either internal ribosomal entry or \"leaky scanning\" of ribosomes [10] . The 4a deletion preserved the transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) preceding 4a gene, which comprise the conserved sequence (CS), and 26 nt downstream of the CS, including the first 22 nt of ORF 4a. In addition, the 3' 101 nt of the 4a gene preceding ORF 4b were maintained in order to preserve translation of 4b protein, as suggested for other CoV ORFs that are translated by similar mechanisms [11] . In the case of MERS-CoV-\u03944b the 4b gene was almost entirely deleted excluding the 4a/4b overlapping sequences and the 3' most 53 nt, in order to maintain the TRS for transcription of gene 5 ( Fig 1A) . MERS-CoV-\u03944a and MERS-CoV-\u03944b were recovered from plasmids pBAC-MERS FL -\u03944a and pBAC-MERS FL -\u03944b, respectively, in Huh-7 cells with titers similar to those of wild-type virus. After two passages in cell culture, the recombinant viruses were sequenced to confirm their stability. The replication kinetics of these singly mutated viruses in Huh-7 cells was not significantly different from that of the wild-type virus ( Fig 1B) , with only a slight decrease in titers at some time points. These results confirm that proteins 4a and 4b were not required for virus replication in cell culture [8] . The presence or absence of 4b and 4a proteins in Huh-7 cells infected with the recombinant viruses MERS-CoV-\u03944a, MERS-CoV-\u03944b and MERS-CoV-\u03944ab was confirmed by Western-blot and immunofluorescence assays. The expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins (A in S2 Fig) and their subcellular distribution (B and C in S2 Fig) were similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that 4a and 4b gene expression was not affected in the deletion mutants. While 4a protein showed a cytoplasmic distribution [9, 12, 13] partially colocalizing with viral dsRNA, 4b protein localized to the nucleus of infected cells, as previously described [10] .",

While deletion of 4a did not have any effect on the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 as compared to the wild-type virus, deletion of 4b significantly increased their expression to similar or even higher levels than those observed in MERS-CoV-\u03944ab, indicating that the 4b protein contributed to the repression of NF-\u03baBdependent gene expression.

A recombinant MERS-CoV-DUP cDNA with a 189 nt duplication including the 4a/4b overlapping sequences (88 bp) and 4a preceding sequences (101 bp), likely required for 4b translation, was generated as a control (DUP, Fig 2A) . Two mutant MERS-CoV cDNAs including the 4a/4b duplication were then engineered either containing alanine mutations of NLS-S1 (RKR!AAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1), or both the intermediate Lys residues and NLS-S2 (KK!AA and KRR!AAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2). Recombinant viruses were rescued from infectious cDNAs in Huh-7 cells and the expression of 4a and 4b proteins was characterized. No significant differences in the expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins in Huh-7 cells were observed by Western-blot analysis, as compared to the wild-type virus (A in S3 Fig) , confirming that genome engineering of 4b NLS mutants did not affect virus gene expression. Accordingly, the cytoplasmic distribution of 4a protein observed in MERS-CoV-wild-type-infected cells was not affected in the NLS mutants (B in S3 Fig) . Analysis by confocal microscopy of 4b subcellular localization (Fig 2B) confirmed that 4b protein was mostly detected in the nucleus in MERS-CoV-DUP-infected cells, as observed in cells infected with wild-type virus. In contrast, mutation of 4b NLS-S1 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1 prevented the nuclear localization of 4b, which was mainly restricted to the cytoplasm. Mutation of NLS-S2 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2 only partially prevented the nuclear import of 4b, with protein detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results demonstrated that in the context of infection, 4b NLS-S1 was essential for nuclear localization, while NLS-S2 had only a partial effect on 4b nuclear import, as described in 4b overexpression experiments [10] . The growth kinetics of MERS-CoV NLS mutants in Huh-7 and Calu-3 (a bronchial epithelial cell line) cells (Fig 2C and C in S3 Fig) confirmed that neither the duplication of 4a-4b sequences nor the mutation of 4b NLS-S1 or NLS-S2 affected viral replication as compared to the wild-type virus. This indicates that the nuclear localization of 4b protein during infection did not have a significant impact on virus replication in cell culture.",

Alternatively, activated NF-\u03baB has been reported to rapidly induce expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 to restore NF-\u03baB inhibition [15] . To examine the impact of viral infection on I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, we further treated infected cells with TNF-\u03b1 for different time periods at 14 hours post-infection, which is expected to induce a sustained reduction in I\u03baB\u03b1 levels. At this time point, significant levels of 4b had accumulated (B in S4 Fig) , providing a scenario where we could evaluate potential inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation by 4b. Degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in infected cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 was associated with induction of pro-inflammatory mRNAs, thus confirming that TNF-\u03b1 activated the NF-\u03baB pathway (C in S4 Fig) . Furthermore, 4b protein significantly reduced the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-\u03b1 in infected cells as compared to infection with \u03944b virus, reinforcing the potential of 4b protein to repress the NF-\u03baB response (C in S4 Fig) . However, no differences in I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were observed in infections with \u03944b and 4b NLS-mutant MERS-CoVs after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, suggesting that the 4b protein did not inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig 3E and A in S4 Fig) . Together, these results indicated that inhibition of the NF-\u03baB response by the 4b protein did not occur at steps prior to the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB.",

The latter interacts with nucleoporins to promote nuclear import [16] . Since MERS-CoV 4b protein includes a bipartite NLS and localizes to the nucleus during infection, we tested whether the bipartite NLS sequences of 4b were required for KPNA4 binding. The basic amino acids in NLS-S1 or NLS-S2 were replaced with alanine in plasmids (4b-mNLS-S1-FLAG or 4b-mNLS-S2-FLAG) and subsequently transfected into Huh-7 cells. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies followed by Western-blot ( Fig 4D) . Endogenous KPNA4 did not co-immunoprecipitate with 4b proteins mutated either in NLS-S1 or NLS-S2, in contrast to wild-type 4b protein. This indicates that MERS-CoV 4b protein requires both NLS-S1 and NLS-S2 for efficient interaction with KPNA4. It also strongly suggests that 4b interacts with KPNA4 as a mechanism to enter the nucleus.",

The importin-\u03b11 subfamily, consisting of KPNA2 and KPNA7, are general importers of cargo that bear a classic NLS; the importin-\u03b12 subfamily, consisting of KPNA4 and KPNA3, are known for their specificity for NF-\u03baB and the regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC)-1; and finally the importin-\u03b13 subfamily, consisting of KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6, is best known for binding phosphorylated STATs as well as several Influenza A virus proteins and Ebola virus VP24 [17] . In our screen, 4b protein only pulled down importin-\u03b12 subfamily members (S5 Fig), which are known to bind NF-\u03baB. To directly test whether 4b preferentially interacted with importin-\u03b12 subfamily proteins, we analyzed the ability of 4b protein to interact with \u03b1-karyopherins of each subfamily. KPNA1 (importin-\u03b13 subfamily), KPNA2 (importin-\u03b11 subfamily), and KPNA3 and KPNA4 (importin-\u03b12 subfamily) were expressed as KPNA-FLAG fusion proteins in Huh-7 cells along with HA-tagged 4b protein. Cells were collected 48 hours post-transfection and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The presence of KPNA and 4b protein was detected by Western-blot with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, respectively ( Fig 5A) . Quantification of relative binding to each karyopherin ( Fig 5B) showed that 4b protein preferentially bound to KPNA4, and to a lesser extent, KPNA3. Binding of 4b protein to karyopherin-\u03b1 family members during infection was assayed in a similar fashion. Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing KPNA-FLAG fusion proteins and infected 48 hours later with wild-type MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. Cells were collected at 20 hpi and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed with anti-4b and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig 5C) . In the context of infection, MERS-CoV 4b protein also preferentially bound to KPNA4 over all other karyopherins, including KPNA3 (Fig 5C  and 5D ). However, 4b could at least minimally bind to other KPNAs, possibly explaining the ability of 4b-mNLS-S2 to partially access the nucleus. The favorable interaction between 4b and KPNA4 is consistent with the idea that 4b prevented the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB by binding to KPNA4 [18] .",

Additionally, during MERS-CoV infection, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was inhibited in the presence of wild-type nuclear 4b protein, in contrast to 4b cytoplasmic mutants. Therefore, we hypothesized that in infected cells, wild type 4b protein would interfere with NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of 4b and the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit at 24 hpi in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell either with wild-type MERS-CoV or with MERS-CoV recombinant viruses expressing cytoplasmic 4b-NLS mutant proteins. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and confocal microscopy analysis showed that during infection with the control viruses, MERS-CoV-wildtype or DUP, 4b protein mainly localized to the nucleus while most of the p65 protein was detected in the cytoplasm (Fig 6A-6C and S6 Fig). In contrast, in infections either with MERS-CoV-\u03944b or MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1, p65 was detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2 infection, the dual distribution of 4b protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm was associated with the presence of p65 in both cellular compartments. This observation suggested that partial access to the nucleus of 4b-mNLS-S2 was enough to allow a significant increase in p65 nuclear import as compared to that observed in the presence of nuclear wild-type 4b protein.",

To address this question, co-IP experiments with FLAG antibodies in Huh-7 cells transfected with a KPNA4-FLAG plasmid and infected with MERS-CoVs expressing 4b-NLS mutant proteins were performed. These results confirmed that binding of KPNA4 to 4b protein was also NLS-dependent in the context of infection (Fig 7) . Interestingly, in wild-type MERS-CoV-infected cells, immunoprecipitation of KPNA4 did not pull-down p65 while it did it in \u03944b and 4b NLS mutant virus infected cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that 4b interacts with KPNA4 in a NLS-dependent manner as a mechanism to gain entry into the nucleus, leading to the inhibition of p65 nuclear import by KPNA4.",

To date, all studies involving MERS-CoV proteins and their interactions with the innate immune response have been done with viral proteins expressed in isolation [10, 12, 13, 19, 20] . These studies can give a glimpse into the mechanisms used by the virus to block interferon and other innate immune factors. However, proteins expressed in isolation may not function as they do in the context of an infection, due to excessive protein production, improper localization, or the presence/absence of specific cellular or viral proteins [21] . Previous reports indicated that when expressed in isolation, 4b blocked IFN expression induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or by overexpression of cellular factors that function in the IFN-induction pathways [20] . Inhibition of IRF-3 or IRF- These results suggested that 4b could inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03b2 in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here, we show that MERS-CoV-\u03944b infection did not induce IFN in Huh-7 cells, while a limited IFN response was observed in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that additional mechanisms independent of 4b expression are used by MERS-CoV to inhibit IFN production [3, 22, 23] .",

We found that 4b was required to prevent a robust NF-\u03baB dependent response during infection of both Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells (S1 Fig and Fig 1C) . This function required the NLS sequences of 4b, as opposed to a previous report [10] , in which overexpressed 4b proteins lacking the NLS were still able to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 induction and to a lesser extent NF-\u03baB signaling. Importantly, we found that the nuclear localization of 4b was associated with the cytoplasmic retention of NF-\u03baB (Fig 6) and consequently, with the repression of NF-\u03baB-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig 3A and 3C) . We also found that both in isolation and during infection, 4b interacted with \u03b1-karyopherin proteins in an NLS-dependent manner. Interestingly, 4b had a strong preference for binding karyopherin-\u03b14, which is also known to translocate the NF-\u03baB protein into the nucleus [18] . Interestingly, 4b binding to KPNA4 during infection inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit (Fig 7) . Thereby we propose a model where 4b outcompetes NF-\u03baB for KPNA4 binding and translocation into the nucleus (Fig 8) . Alternatively, other functions of 4b or additional MERS-CoV proteins might also contribute to the NF-\u03baB antagonism, as described for other coronaviruses, which include multiple proteins that antagonize the host IFN and NF-\u03baB responses [22, 27] .",

Nuclear localization of 4b is exceptional among the other known viral PDEs, found in the cytoplasm. However, in the context of MHV infection, minor expression levels of MERS-CoV 4b in the cytoplasm are sufficient to prevent RNase L activation and, in fact, removal of the NLS did not improve RNase L antagonism.

CoV nsp1 and SARS-CoV ORF 3b proteins are sufficiently small to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex [30, 32] .

Herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein interacts with the nucleoporin Nup62, an structural component of the NPC, leading to the inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport pathways mediated by transportin or importins [36] . Similarly, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BGLF4 kinase interacts with the nucleoporins Nup62 and Nup153 inhibiting canonical NLS-mediated nuclear import while promoting the nuclear import of non-NLS-containing EBV lytic proteins [37] .",

A similar mechanism of inhibition has also been described for Ebola virus VP24 [41] . Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection suppresses IFN responses by inhibiting STAT1/2 nuclear transport through the induction of caspase-3-dependent degradation of KPNA1 [42] . Poliovirus and rhinovirus infection induce proteolysis of the NPC components Nup153 and p62, leading to a general inhibition of nuclear import [43, 44] . The association of viral proteins with the host nuclear import pathway confirms its relevance in virus-host interactions, regulating innate immunity and cellular responses to infection.",

Therefore, viruses in diverse families have evolved a variety of mechanisms to target nuclear transport of the NF-\u03baB complex and thereby inhibit its activation. The nucleocapsid protein of Hantaan virus inhibits NF-\u03baB activation by limiting p65 nuclear translocation, as shown in overexpression experiments [45] , presumably by its interaction with importin-\u03b1 through a putative NLS. Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 competitively inhibits NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation by binding to KPNA2, 3 and 4, presumably through two NLSs within NS5, which surprisingly does not accumulate in the nucleus [46] . Alternatively, viral proteins such as Herpes simplex virus 1 UL24 inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway by binding p65 and p50 subunits and preventing their nuclear translocation [47] .",

            "text": "In CoVs, there is also evidence supporting the relevance of the NF-\u03baB pathway in pathogenesis. Increased NF-\u03baB activation is a determinant of the exacerbated lung inflammatory pathology caused by SARS-CoV infection [6] . Consequently, inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation and increased survival of SARS-CoV-infected mice [5] . Dual regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling during HCoV-229E infection has been described, consisting in the simultaneous induction of the NF-\u03baB pathway, which has a pro-viral effect, and the restriction of the NF-\u03baB response to limit transcription of pro-inflammatory and other potentially antiviral host cell genes [48] . Here, our results with MERS-CoV 4b protein are compatible with this concept of repression of the NF-\u03baB-mediated pro-inflammatory response during CoV infection. Viral antagonists of the innate immune response contribute to the pathogenic potential of coronaviruses in vivo [27, 49] . In particular, inhibition of nuclear import by SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to mediate pleiotropic alterations in host gene expression during infection [50] that enhance viral pathogenesis in vivo [51] . In addition, MERS-CoV 4b protein expressed in mice by chimeric MHV viruses acted as an RNase L antagonist contributing to pathogenesis in vivo [28] . From this study and from the results reported here, it might be speculated that deletion of MERS-CoV 4b protein would enhance the host antiviral response leading to virus attenuation in vivo. However, the possibility that the increased NF-\u03baB-response induced by 4b deletion could result in lung inflammatory pathology [5] cannot be excluded until in vivo studies are performed.",

In WT MERS-CoV infection, 4b protein with an intact NLS binds KPNA4 for nuclear translocation thereby outcompeting NF-\u03baB binding to KPNA4, which retains NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm and inhibits the expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, in the absence of 4b (MERS-CoV-\u03944b) or in the presence of cytoplasmic 4b NLS-mutants (MERS-CoV-4b-mNLS), which do not bind KPNA4, NF-\u03baB is imported into the nucleus by KPNA4, where it binds to DNA \u03baB sites to promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006838.g008",
