The present time-series analyses of short and long oligonucleotide compositions in these genomes showed directional changes in their composition after invasion from a nonhuman host, which are thought to recur after future invasions. In the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak, directional time-series changes in a wide range of oligonucleotides were observed in common for three geographic areas, and the directional changes were observed also for the recent MERS coronavirus epidemics starting in the Middle East. In addition, common directional changes in human influenza A viruses were observed for three subtypes, whose epidemics started independently. Long oligonucleotides that showed an evident directional change observed in common for the three subtypes corresponded to some of influenza A siRNAs, whose activities have been experimentally proven. Predicting directional and reoccurring changes in oligonucleotide composition should become important for designing diagnostic RT-PCR primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness.",

To face the world-wide threats caused by zoonotic RNA viruses, which suddenly cause serious outbreaks by invasion from nonhuman hosts and mutate rapidly, we must understand the molecular evolutionary changes in their genome sequences extensively by innovating various technologies, including those used in big data analyses, e.g., large-scale word count. Time-series word count of oligonucleotides in genome sequences can be conducted without specialized assumptions and prior knowledge and is useful for unsupervised data mining. Importantly the obtained results are easily understandable, even for those unfamiliar with molecular evolutionary studies.",

Viruses are inevitably dependent on many host factors for their growth (e.g., nucleotide pools, proteins and RNAs) and must escape from host antiviral mechanisms (e.g., interferon-induced systems) [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, after the invasion of zoonotic viruses from nonhumans, a certain level of directional change in genomic sequences and thus in mono-and oligonucleotide compositions should occur during human-to-human transmission. In fact, the G+ C% of influenza A virus strains isolated from humans is lower than that of strains isolated from natural hosts, which were avian 10 , and the CG dinucleotide in an A/U context has been preferentially eliminated from classical H1N1 influenza viruses during human-to-human transmission 11 . By using BLSOM (Batch Learning Self-Organizing Map) 12,13 , we previously found directional compositional changes in a wide range of oligonucleotides 14, 15 that occurred after the onset of the influenza H1N1/09 pandemic of 2009 [16] [17] [18] .",

Long oligonucleotides are key elements of diagnostic PCR primers 19 and potentially promising nucleic-acid therapeutics (e.g., antisense RNA, siRNA and miRNA) 19, [20] [21] [22] [23] . RNA viruses mutate very rapidly, and therefore, their sequence changes should be intensively characterized for designing diagnostic and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness. The present time-series analysis on influenza A genomes showed that the 20-mers exhibiting the most evident directional changes observed in common for three different subtypes corresponded to several influenza A siRNAs, which were experimentally validated.

Because of the recent major threat to public health in West Africa, more than 1000 genomes of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) strains, isolated from humans from 2014 to 2015, have been sequenced, and the sequences are available from the NCBI Virus Variation Database 24 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/ebola/). To study molecular evolutionary changes in EBOV genomes in the current epidemic, we obtained 1020 strains, for which the isolated dates are given. Although we focused on full-length genomes, a minor portion was relatively short in length, or many unidentified \"N\" bases were included, partly because of the stringent sterilization treatment obligated by the local government 3 . Because these will give odd values of mono-and oligonucleotide compositions, we focused on 935 genomes longer than 18.5 kb after omitting N bases, which were derived from 244 Guinea, 156 Liberia and 535 Sierra Leone strains.

Because mutations occur primarily as random processes, mononucleotide compositions for strains isolated even around the same day clearly differed from each other, which resulted in evident compositional diversity. Despite this diversity, which should also be due to sequencing uncertainty, linear regression lines appear to show a time-dependent increasing or decreasing trend, a possible increase for C% and G% and a possible decrease for A% and U%. This is consistent with the excess U-to-C mutations found by two groups 2,3 . 24 .

This could be done because the genome sequence data were distributed rather evenly by area and month; the average number of strains per month was 22.2, 41.2 and 17.3 for Guinea (blue), Sierra Leone (green) and Liberia (brown), respectively. We omitted the data for a few months, for which no more than 5 strains were available in the respective area. Figure 1b shows a more conspicuous increasing or decreasing trend than Fig. 1a , and the time-series increasing or decreasing trend revealed by the regression line for the elapsed months was the same among the three areas for all nucleotides, except for an ambiguous case of G% for Guinea. In more detail, positive and negative directions of the regression line were primarily common among the three areas, although the slope angle appear to differ; Table 1 lists Pearson's correlation coefficients calculated separately for the three areas. The highest negative (\u2212 0.94) or positive (0.92) correlation among mononucleotides was observed for A% or C%, respectively, in Liberia, which corresponded to a decrease of 10.2 As or an increase of 11.4 Cs per genome at the final stage of the current outbreak.

A separate regression analysis that could examine the statistical significance of directional changes from the epidemic start for all three areas, was conducted, by including the data of strains isolated at or near the beginning of the current epidemic (i.e., 2014 March strains in Guinea) in Liberia and Sierra Leone data. The results thus obtained by the latter analysis were consistent with those obtained by the former, and the null hypothesis (i.e. no correlation) was rejected at statistically significant levels in most cases, as described in Figure legend Short oligonucleotide composition in ebolavirus genomes. Next, we analyzed each dinucleotide composition in the genomes grouped for each month. The results presented in Fig. 2a , Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 1a show that a common increasing or decreasing trend was observed among the three areas for more than half of the sixteen dinucleotides. Correlation coefficients higher than 0.8 or less than \u2212 0.8 are colored in Table 1 . For nine of the ten colored dinucleotides, the coefficient in the other two areas primarily shows the common directional trend.

We thus calculated the ratio of the observed dinucleotide occurrence to that expected from the mononucleotide composition (obs/exp) and found a decrease for UU and GC and an increase for GU, UG, AC and UA, which was common among the three areas ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1a) .

A spatiotemporal word count can be conducted without specific assumptions or prior knowledge and visualizes viral evolutionary changes in an easily understandable way. Two distinct models can explain the common increasing or decreasing trend among the three areas, which was observed for a wide range of mono-and oligonucleotides. [Model 1] Throughout the current EBOV epidemic, virus movement between the three areas was extensive; therefore, the time-dependent trend of directional changes in oligonucleotide composition was common among the areas. [Model 2] Even without the extensive mixing of viruses, common directional changes can occur. For example, viruses inevitably depend on many host factors for their growth, but human cells may not provide an ideal growth environment for invading viruses; therefore, common directional changes occur after invasions from nonhumans for supporting more efficient growth in human cells. In this connection, Park et al. 3 reported there was no clear evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Furthermore, although an increasing or decreasing trend for a wide range of mono-and oligonucleotides is common among the three areas, their actual composition (%) and the slope angle of the directional change often differ among the areas. This observation is consistent with Model 2 and the report by Park et al. 3 but not with Model 1, as discussed below from various aspects.",

Additionally, antiviral mechanisms 7-10 should differ between humans and natural hosts. Host macromolecules involved in viral growth (either supporting or inhibiting) should primarily recognize oligonucleotides, such as several nucleotides or longer, rather than mononucleotides. Hence, we analyzed time-series changes in pentanucleotide (5-mer) occurrences. We first calculated correlation coefficients for all 1024 (= 4 5 ) 5-mers and sorted them by the averaged correlation coefficients for the three areas. Figure 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1b show time-series patterns of 5-mers with evidently high or low correlation coefficients; 384 or 50 (of 1024 types) 5-mers showed a common decreasing or increasing trend among the areas, respectively. Examination of the ratio of the observed occurrences to those expected from the mononucleotide composition (obs/exp) showed that directional changes of many 5-mers cannot be explained by a cumulative effect of mononucleotide changes (data not shown), as found for various dinucleotides. When further examining the 5-mers showing the common directional change in more detail, their actual occurrence level and slope of Supplementary Fig. 1b) , and the difference often became clearer compared to that for mono-and dinucleotides. This cannot be explained by the aforementioned Model 1.

EBOV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, and the sequences registered in the database and analyzed here were complementary to viral genome sequences, but MERS virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and, therefore, genome sequences were analyzed. This difference, however, cannot explain differences in directional changes in monoand oligonucleotide composition of EBOV and MERS viruses.

The time-dependent gain of U 5 (Fig. 3b) clearly differs from its loss for EBOV (Fig. 3a) . Although the regression lines (blue lines in Figs 3b and 4) were calculated only for human strains, occurrence data for camel strains (brown) were primarily positioned around the regression line, thus fitting the previous report that MERS viruses were repeatedly transmitted between camels and humans in the present epidemic 25 .

Alternatively, because 20 times more sequences are available than for EBOV, we selected years with at least ten strains of one category to reduce the artefactual effects derived from sequencing uncertainty.

Here, we discuss the backset occurring after one outbreak may relate to the differential slopes of directional changes observed for different subtypes (Figs 5 and 6 ). pH1N1 strains, which are primarily derived from one outbreak, show an evidently steeper slope than H1N1 and H3N2 strains derived from multiple outbreaks, indicating a higher rate of pH1N1genome sequence changes. The first discussion was whether pH1N1 had an evidently higher mutation rate than H1N1 and H3N2. We propose here that without introducing the higher mutation rate of pH1N1, its seemingly higher rate of genome sequence changes can be explained by the model that conforms to the abrupt backset that occurred after an outbreak. When considering a viral infection spread, the ratio of persons with or without proper resistance to the viral infection (e.g., antibodies The same colored and smaller symbols than for human subtypes are used for avian A subtypes because differences among avian subtypes were not a concern in the present study. Because the B type has moved gradually toward human A subtypes, this type appears not to have reached its hypothesized goal, which may possibly lie between human A and B types, but nearer the latter. (b) A horizontally long panel for A% of three human A subtypes is presented for clarifying detailed changes occurring within and after one outbreak of pH1N1.

Therefore, the blooming strains (and their close relatives) in a certain outbreak (especially in a pandemic) may not be a very suitable strain for restarting the next outbreak because antibodies highly effective against the blooming strains are held by a large portion of humans. Less blooming strains, that are less adapted to humans, may become good starting strains for the next outbreak, resulting in a backset after one outbreak, as observed in Figs 5b and 6b and Supplementary Fig.  2 . Hence, the evolutionary change focusing on strains belonging to a single outbreak looks higher than those belonging to multiple outbreaks, giving a steeper slope. To illustrate this interpretation, we added hypothetical data of H3N2 strains belonging to one outbreak as a series of small light-brown dots representing the dinucleotide compositions hypothesized for individual months, whose slope angle simply mimics that of pH1N1. Although other various mechanisms must be included to explain the backset after one outbreak, we propose that the steep slope of pH1N1 can be explained without introducing the higher mutation rate of pH1N1.",

At the beginning stage of three independent epidemics, most strains had one copy of the 20-mer, but during the course of human-to-human transmission the copy number decreased in the viral population and were almost completely lost at the final stage in all three subtypes; i.e., the strains having this 20-mer sequence progressively reduced their share in viral populations, regardless of differences in subtypes.

Actually, VIRsiRNAdb 29 , which have complied the experimentally validated siRNA sequences, contains 96 siRNAs for influenza A viruses; and their length ranges from 19 to 21. When we searched viral siRNA sequences that were highly homologous to the 20-mers with an evident common increasing or decreasing trend with a BLAST search against VIRsiRNAdb, we found that four 19-mer influenza A siRNAs (virsi1635, 1640, 1645 and 1650), which had the same sequence (CAGCAGAGUGCUGUGGAUG) but were experimentally validated in different cell lines, showed a complete match to the 19-mer sequence harbored by the aforementioned five 20-mers, which are components of one 24-mer (AGGAACAGCAGAGUGCUGUGGAUG). Although these five 20-mers gave practically the same decreasing pattern to that listed in Fig. 7a , the compensatorily increased 20-mer responding to their decrease differed slightly in changed positions among the subtypes. Figure 7b ,c present patterns of the compensatorily increased 20-mers, which had nonsynonymous and synonymous changes from the original 20-mer, respectively (for details, see the Legend). This indicates that the sequence ranging over a certain length is possibly inconvenient for efficient growth in human cells ranges and that changes within the range can resolve the possible inconvenience. Since both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes were observed, the possible inconvenience should not relate to protein sequence.

An important issue is clarification of biological mechanisms responsible for directional changes in oligonucleotide occurrences after host changes.
