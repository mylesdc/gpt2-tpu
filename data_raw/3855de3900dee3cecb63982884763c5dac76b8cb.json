Since that time, many approaches have been tried to deliver antiviral antibodies into the cell cytoplasm in a more efficient manner to transition the approach from experimental to therapeutic. An early validation step in this process is the intracellular expression of antibodies from transfected plasmid DNA that enables the rapid evaluation of the resulting \"intrabodies. \" The process is straightforward and enables screening for desired characteristics such as improved solubility and characterizing inhibitory activities. Rarely IgG genes have been directly employed in this approach for antiviral strategies (4) since they are complex multidomain (n = 12) and multi-chain (n = 2) molecules tending to favor secreted environments for productive expression. Instead, smaller antibody fragment genes like Fab (four domains), scFv (two domains), and derivatives have been explored and shown to be functional within the reducing cytosol to varying degrees [for reviews, see Ref. (5, 6) ].",

Since intrabodies are by definition within the cell, they also lack classical effector regions to enhance antiviral activity through classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Unengineered sdAbs also lack the bivalency of IgG and are devoid of antiviral enhancements possible through avidity. Consequently, approaches to employ monovalent intrabodies and antibody mimetics as antivirals have tended to focus on impeding very specific viral functions where the impact of direct binding to target antigen is likely to be large. Examples include a scFv that binds to HPV16 E6 protein and inhibits p53 degradation (10) and a sdAb that inhibits HIV rev multimerization (11) .",

We hypo thesized that leveraging the steric bulk of macromolecular viral assemblies against one another would convert a normally innocuous monovalent sdAb into one with highantiviral potency. Therefore, rather than focusing on inhibiting specific interactions between virus-virus or virus-cell proteins, we reasoned it should be possible to disrupt viral replication by promoting aberrant interactions. We aimed to crosslink cytosolic viral macromolecules using sdAb engineered as tandem dimers. In this manner, we should elicit a large impact on viral replication with a small amount of sdAb, which is ideal for advancing down a therapeutic track where high efficacy is ultimately required. We have christened these sdAb \"Xintrabodies\" to fuse the abbreviation for crosslinking (X) with the term for intrabody.",

All sdAb were capable of forming highly sensitive monoclonal affinity reagent sandwich assays (16) by reacting with detergent-treated virus preparations or recombinant NP suggesting the epitope they bound was displayed polyvalently along the NP polymer as visualized previously by others (17, 18) . While our original plan was to employ these sdAbs in developing preclinical diagnostics, we rationalized they might also be promising candidates for exploring our crosslinking approach since the mass of NP polymers would be tens of MDa versus 30 kDa for the sdAb dimers.",

            "text": "A peculiar feature of many viral replication pathways is the formation of virogenic inclusion bodies or virus factories that could lend themselves to being particularly attractive sinks for intrabodies. The high concentration of target antigens and compartmentalization of certain cell processes are thought to drive more efficient genome replication, viral component, and/or even viral particle assembly (depending on the particular virus). Consequently, these sites could be very vulnerable to a crosslinking strategy as opposed to targeting diffusely distributed antigens throughout the cytoplasm. For both MARV and EBOV, the inclusions are highly dynamic sites of replication and contain large numbers of NP polymers (19) (20) (21) and several other viral proteins (L, VP24, VP30, and VP35) that together form the ribonucleocapsid (RNC) that encapsidates the RNA genome. These RNC assemblies have been shown to leave the inclusions on a one by one basis for transport through the cytoplasm for assembly at the cell periphery (22, 23) . At the membrane, the RNCs interact with matrix protein VP40 to form enveloped infectious virus particles studded with the host cell targeting molecule GP that are then released. We hypothesized that the introduction of Xintrabodies into this model system will crosslink the RNC within the inclusions and impede the migration of NP to the cell periphery and restrict its ability to be packaged (Figure 1) . FigUre 1 | Overall hypothesis of the approach showing that crosslinking a viral structural protein within the cell using a multimeric single-domain antibody (sdAb) will impede viral replication by disrupting the orderly assembly of infectious virus particles (virions). The dimeric sdAb can be introduced into the uninfected target cell or virus-infected cell via endogenous gene expression, gene delivery, protein transfection, or protein transduction to mediate the antiviral activity. Here, we focus on utilizing Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus nucleoprotein (NP) as our model target since we have sdAb to hand that bind polyvalent assemblies. Our working theory is that our sdAb dimers or Xintrabodies are crosslinking NP epitopes among ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) within viral factories and inhibiting their transport to the cell membrane for further assembly into virions. It should be noted that other antigens involved in assembly may be equally effective provided suitable sdAb are available, although targeting antigens that occur in viral factories may be advantageous owing to high local concentrations. The overall approach may be applicable to many other viruses and scaffolding components and leverages relatively small amounts of minute 30 kDa dimeric sdAb crosslinking MDa sized targets to impede productive viral replication. Herein, we describe our studies on assembling, producing, and evaluating sdAb monomers and dimers in vitro and cell culture, comparing and contrasting their impacts on NP crosslinking in vitro, NP incorporation into virus-like particles (VLPs), and replication of virus. resUlTs ensuring Tandem sdabs Were able to Bind antigen Since all of our sdAb were originally selected using g3p phage display with free N-termini we had to ensure that fusions retained binding and ideally showed enhanced activity reflective of avidity when expressed as sdAb-sdAb dimers. We therefore assembled monomers and dimers of anti-MARV sdAb A, B, and C and anti-EBOV sdAb E in our standard dual expression and display vector pecan126 (16) for production of protein in the Escherichia coli periplasm. All clones were well expressed as monomers as expected (Figure 2A ) and as dimers ( Figure 2B ) highlighting the modularity of the single-domain fold for recombinant expression campaigns. To test the binding ability of the sdAb in vitro, we generated polymeric MARV and EBOV NP by HEK 293T transient expression and a purification regime that ended with CsCl gradient centrifugation to band the polymers.",

Despite the apparent drop in expression levels, the dimeric forms of sdAb B and sdAb E are still just visible on Coomassie blue staining of the soluble fraction ( Figure 3D ) indicating that at least when expressed alone in the HEK 293T system, these sdAb formats are highly productive.

The M1, M2, E1, and E2 sdAbs were produced in E. coli with the C9 tag through periplasmic expression, IMAC purification, and gel filtration to generate highly pure proteins similar to those produced above ( Figure  S1A in Supplementary Material). Again, in multiple hands, we noticed similar production levels apparent for monomers and dimers from E. coli expressions suggesting tandem dimers are straightforward to produce in this host. Polymeric HA-tagged MARV and HA-tagged EBOV NP proteins were generated using the same optimized scaled up transient HEK 293T expression and purification protocol as above ( Figure S1B in Supplementary Material). Different molar ratios of sdAb monomer and dimer proteins were combined with purified HA-NP, equilibrated for 1 h, and then the mixtures analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 4 ; Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). Here, the purity of the HA-NP preparations can be clearly seen as they form the classical helical filamentous structures seen by others. Only the dimeric forms of each sdAb were able to crosslink their corresponding HA-NP polymers in a genus-specific manner while the monomeric forms had no discernible effect. The crosslinking ability of the dimers extended to 1:1 and 0.1:1 M ratios of sdAb to HA-NP though uncrosslinked helical NP filaments are visible at lower ratios, suggesting the sdAbs are being out-titrated. At the lower concentrations, the anti-MARV dimer appeared to be better at crosslinking than the anti-EBOV dimer and following quantification, we assessed it to be approximately 10-fold more potent at aggregating HA-NP ( Figure 5 ). Crosslinking NP polymers in vitro in this manner reassures us that the arbitrarily chosen 20 mer linker between the tandem sdAb B proteins does not restrict binding to two epitopes on a single polymer (intra-NP binding) but allows inter-NP binding. It would be of interest to explore whether alterations in linker length and composition might further improve crosslinking efficacy.",

When NP and VP40 are coexpressed, the result is VLPs made of NP and VP40. VLP composition in terms of \u00b1NP there fore gives us a convenient way of analyzing the impact of Xintrabody expression on NP packaging. Since the particles are non-infectious, the approach is useable at BSL-2 for added convenience. Transient expression of combinations of MARV VP40, HA-NP, and the various sdAb constructs in HEK 293T cells revealed that NP was missing from those VLPs secreted from cells cotransfected with dimeric anti-MARV sdAb (M2) plasmid ( Figure 6A) . Examination of the cell lysates corresponding to these VLP expressions ( Figure 6B ) revealed that HA-NP was well expressed suggesting that the Xintrabody had not blocked NP production but a later step in VLP assembly. Importantly, the levels of sdAb are so low as to be not visible by Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels when coexpressed with the viral proteins, yet the dimeric sdAb still has a dramatic inhibitory effect. A similar pattern for EBOV was evident when combinations of EBOV VP40, HA-NP, and the various sdAb were employed ( Figure 6C ) in that dimeric anti-EBOV sdAb (E2) inhibited NP incorporation into particles while other sdAb did not. Again, analysis of whole cell lysates revealed that EBOV HA-NP was being produced within the cells in large amounts suggesting a post-translational block of NP incorporation into VLPs was being elicited by E2 ( Figure 6D ). Figures S3A,B in Supplementary Material show Western blots of the MARV and EBOV cell lysates, respectively, to confirm expression of the sdAb monomers and dimers (since we were unable to visualize these through gel staining) and also confirm expression of NP and VP40.",

By analyzing the transient coexpression of MARV VP40, MARV HA-NP, and the M1, M2, E1 and E2 sdAb via immuno-staining the cells, we were able to monitor the impact of intrabody expression on NP and VP40 colocalization, which is normally evident during virion assembly. The M1 monomer shows a mix of cytosolic diffuse presence and localization with HA-NP as expected and does not appear to reduce the overlap of HA-NP with VP40 seen in the merged image ( Figure 7A ). In contrast, the M2 dimer appears to lose the diffuse cytosolic staining pattern, colocalizing at HA-NP pools, which are reflective of the virogenic inclusions. HA-NP VP40 colocalization appears to be inhibited and VP40 localization to the membrane appears reduced. As our ELISA data showed the dimeric M2 sdAb may well have better ability to target NP polymers over the monomeric sdAb and may well be enhanced at the NP pooling sites. It is important to note that in the presence of M2 dimer the HA-NP does not appear to be present at high levels in any locations other than focused punctate sites suggesting the dimeric sdAb is indeed restricting NP leaving to traffic to the membrane for assembly. The control anti-EBOV E1 and E2 as expected do not appear to colocalize with NP since they are not cross-reactive with MARV, enabling VP40 and NP to colocalize as seen in the merged images. We applied the same methodology to transient transfections of EBOV VP40 and HA-NP and saw the same general trends in that cognate dimer sdAb E2 localized to EBOV HA-NP pools and appeared to restrict colocalization with VP40, whereas the other antibody formats including the monomer sdAb E1 did not ( Figure 7B ).",

We confirmed the ability of each sdAb dimer to colocalize with its cognate NP following transient expression of either MARV HA-NP ( Figure 8C ) or EBOV HA-NP ( Figure 8D ) within parental, Vero-M2 or Vero-E2 cell lines. We next challenged the cells in a plaque titration with MARV to reveal that the Vero-M2 line is capable of reducing the number of plaques approximately fivefold when compared to control Vero wild-type cells or the Vero-E2 cell line (Figure 9A) . When a similar experiment was performed with EBOV no difference in the number of plaques was observed between Vero-E2 and the other cell lines (Figure 9B) , FigUre 9 | Impact of Xintrabodies on viral replication. Marburgvirus (MARV) (a) and Ebolavirus (EBOV) (B) were titrated on wild-type Vero cells (wt) or the stable lines expressing the anti-MARV dimer (M2) or anti-EBOV dimer (E2) and plaque formation under semi-solid overlay allowed to proceed for 10 days. The experiment was performed twice for MARV and three times for EBOV and error bars represent the SD. Diameters of approximately 150 plaques from the titrations were measured using ImageJ measure analysis tool and plotted for MARV (c) and EBOV (D). An unpaired, one-tail t-test analysis revealed a p-value of <0.0001 (****) while ns indicates no significant difference. Bars indicate SD and the mean.

The experiment was performed three times for MARV and twice for EBOV. An unpaired, one-tail t-test was conducted using Excel, * indicating a p-value <0.05 and ** indicating a p-value <0.005. suggesting that plaque number was not being limited in the semi-solid overlay system. However, analysis of the plaque diameters revealed a significant decrease in the sizes of plaques for MARV in Vero-M2 ( Figure 9C ) and for EBOV in Vero-E2 ( Figure 9D ) compared to the non-cognate and wild-type cell lines. To better study the dynamics of viral replication and the impact of sdAb dimer upon it, we challenged the wild-type and cognate dimer cell lines within a liquid overlay setting. Supernatants were harvested in a time-course and the resulting progeny were titrated on wild-type cells. For both MARV and EBOV, there is a significant reduction in progeny virus early in the time-course but the impact diminishes as the experiment progresses ( Figure 9E) . The impact of anti-MARV and anti-EBOV sdAb dimers are far from optimal and by no means providing sterilizing immunity, yet combined with all of the previous data are indicating that the Xintrabody approach has potential.",

In this manner, we take advantage of small amounts of dimeric sdAbs having a big effect on large amounts of antigen. The approach is admirably suited to targeting viral factories where large amounts of viral antigens can lie in close proximity and become very vulnerable to a crosslinking intrabody or Xintrabody approach. We certainly benefited from a panel of four anti-MARV sdAb clones from which to identify productive intrabodies. In the first place, perhaps tandemization is not ideal where free N-termini are required to take full advantage of bivalency and other N-terminal free oligomerization strategies such as leucine zippers (30) could be useful here. Second, several sdAbs were not especially productive when expressed in the cytosol, yet there are sequence tags available that can rescue poorly soluble clones (31) and can even enhance degradation of target antigens.",

Microscopic analyses of dimeric sdAb revealed them to be focused on pools of NP and capable of restricting the distribution of NP to the areas where VP40 was localized. Combined with the electron microscopic views of in vitro crosslinking of purified NP and sdAb dimer preparations, it is tempting to speculate that in cells we are crosslinking RNC in the virogenic inclusions, yet finer resolution immuno-electron microscopy would be required to confirm this as certain. The stable cell lines expressing the anti-MARV and anti-EBOV Xintrabodies did not show the same dramatic effect as the VLP system but nonetheless resulted in smaller plaques and reduced virus yields when compared to wild-type cells at early timepoints. Yet, when one considers the low levels of constitutively expressed recombinant proteins in cell lines not employing gene amplification or locus control regions, it is quite remarkable that our dimeric sdAbs had any impact at all. Furthermore, it is more than likely that host gene expression patterns are altered upon virus infection to reduce dimer production even further during the course of viral replication one could envisage employing a host cell promoter induced upon infection to drive more Xintrabody expression (32) . Antiviral sdAbs reactive with several viral glycoproteins have been shown to be massively improved in neutralization potency and breadth of reactivity when multimerized and can even protect against disease in animal models [for review, see Ref. (33) ]. To the best of our knowledge, leveraging a multimerization routine for intrabodies has not yet been demonstrated and indicates Xintrabodies to be a novel potential therapeutic antibody development route. Though novel for recombinant intrabody technology, the strategy of crosslinking pathogen antigens as a defense mechanism is not new to nature. The immune system encodes natural crosslinkers of viral proteins including the carbohydrate-binding innate defensins, which can crosslink surface glycoproteins to create an inflexible barricade that inhibits entry to cells (34) . The innate Mx proteins can be induced cytoplasmically and smother intracellular polymeric target proteins including many viral NPs (35) . Adaptive immunity can also generate potent crosslinkers of monomers within the HA trimers of influenza A virus (36) to inhibit viral entry processes. Intra-spike crosslinkers based on IgG-derived Fab have also been further engineered to elevate anti-HIV potency a 100-fold and to reduce the chances of immune evasion (37) . Heterologous lectins from algae such as Griffithsin also mediate crosslinking of viral glycoproteins and are being explored as antivirals against HIV (38) and can be enhanced by engineering multimerized forms (39) . Perhaps for us the most relevant example of the potency of the crosslinking strategy is the anti-influenza A virus small compound drug nucleozin which exerts both early and late effects through impedance of N (NP) and RNC trafficking with the latter impact restricting packaging also (40, 41) .",

Here, we note that despite recombinant antibody technology having thrived for over 25 years, examples of success in assembling functional transbodies have been very limited (44) . The approach may be fickle owing to incompatibility between compartments required for optimal antibody expression (periplasm) and the highly structured and charged tags required for transduction, e.g., HIV tat domain (45) . Once protein is generated, the efficiency of reaching the cytosol may also be low due to endosomal entrapment though newer approaches appear to overcome this impasse using cell surface binding motifs to drive locally higher concentrations favorable for endosomal uptake and release (46) . More recently, cyclic arginine rich motifs have shown promise as efficient sdAb delivery motifs (47) though these assemblies required in vitro ligation of the motif to the antibody, which may complicate scale-up. Despite these caveats, one group has pioneered monomeric transbodies to several viruses including influenza A (48), HCV (49) , and more recently even Ebola (50) which is encouraging us to pursue the transition of Xintrabodies to Xtransbodies.",

Eagle's MEM (Lonza) plus 4 mM l-glutamine and 2 mM sodium pyruvate was mixed 1:1 with agarose. Virus was carefully removed with a P1000 pipette and overlayed with 2 ml of the EMEM agarose. The agarose was allowed to solidify for 10 min at room temperature and the plates incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10-11 days with humidity and CO2. The plates and overlays were then fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and removed from the BSL-4 via the chemical dunk tank. Overlays were then removed and cells stained with 1% crystal violet for plaque counting. The experiment was repeated a total of two times for MARV and three times for EBOV. Following scanning of the plates, approximately 150 clearly separated plaques for each cell line were analyzed using ImageJ to record the diameters. An unpaired one-tail t-test within Graphpad was used to identify statistical significance. Marburg Musoke and Ebola Zaire Kikwit growth kinetics were evaluated on Vero E6 wild-type or the constitutive sdAb dimer expressing cell lines Vero-M2 and Vero-E2, respectively, seeded at 8e+5 cells per well in 6-well plates in 2 ml complete medium at approximately 18 h prior to infection. Medium was removed and 500 \u00b5l of virus in SF DMEM added per well at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with humidity and 10% CO2 with gentle rocking for 1 h. The virus was carefully removed with a P1000 pipette, cells washed once with 1 ml of complete medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2, 6, or 9 days in 2 ml complete medium. At time of collection, medium from a single well was removed by a P1000 pipette, clarified in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube in a microfuge at 8,000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then transferred to Sarstedt 2 ml screw cap micro tubes (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany) and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C until required. Each time point was titrated on duplicate wells of wild-type Vero E6 cells and the titer averaged. The time-course, collections, and titrations were repeated a total of three times for MARV and twice for EBOV with plaque forming units per milliliter obtained on each stable cell line presented as percentages of those obtained on the wildtype cells \u00b1SD. An unpaired one-tail t-test was used to identify statistical significance.",
