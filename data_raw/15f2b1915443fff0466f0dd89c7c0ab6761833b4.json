However, bioinformatic analysis recently identified an overlapping ORF (ORFX) in Seg-9. We show that ORFX encodes a new non-structural protein, identified here as NS4. Western blotting and confocal fluorescence microscopy, using antibodies raised against recombinant NS4 from Bluetongue virus (BTV, which is insect-borne), or Great Island virus (GIV, which is tick-borne), demonstrate that these proteins are synthesised in BTV or GIV infected mammalian cells, respectively. BTV NS4 is also expressed in Culicoides insect cells. NS4 forms aggregates throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, consistent with identification of nuclear localisation signals within the NS4 sequence. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that NS4 contains coiled-coils, is related to proteins that bind nucleic acids, or are associated with membranes and shows similarities to nucleolar protein UTP20 (a processome subunit). Recombinant NS4 of GIV protects dsRNA from degradation by endoribonucleases of the RNAse III family, indicating that it interacts with dsRNA. However, BTV NS4, which is only half the putative size of the GIV NS4, did not protect dsRNA from RNAse III cleavage. NS4 of both GIV and BTV protect DNA from degradation by DNAse. NS4 was found to associate with lipid droplets in cells infected with BTV or GIV or transfected with a plasmid expressing NS4.",

In most cases each genome segment encodes a single protein from a single open reading frame (ORF), expect segment 9 (Seg-9) and segment 10 (Seg-10), both of which encode two nearly identical proteins initiated from in-phase AUG codons close together near the upstream termini (VP6 and VP6a encoded by Seg-9, and NS3 and NS3a encoded by Seg-10) [2, 5] . However, in vitro translation of BTV RNA segments reproducibly generated a number of smaller translation products of unknown significance, that were usually dismissed as unimportant byproducts of translation [2] .",

VP1, VP4 and VP6 are minor enzymatic proteins that are packaged along with the ten genome segments within the central space of the virus core [6, 7] . The orbivirus outer-capsid layer is composed of two additional structural proteins (VP2 and VP5 of BTV), which mediate cell-attachment and penetration during initiation of infection. These outer-capsid proteins are more variable than the core proteins and most of the non-structural proteins, and the specificity of their reactions with neutralising antibodies determines the virus serotype (as exemplified by VP2 of BTV [8] ). The relative number and locations of the BTV structural proteins have been determined in biochemical and structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography [7, 9, 10, 11, 12] .",

VIB represent the primary site of virus replication and assembly. The smallest of the BTV non-structural proteins that were previously identified, are membrane glycoproteins NS3 and NS3a, which are expressed in large amounts in insect cells, but not in mammalian cells. They are involved in the release of progeny virus particles from infected cells [15] .

Highest identity was detected between BTV and EHDV (50%), followed by PHSV and YUOV-1 (30%). Amino acid identity in NS4 between the tickborne and insect-borne viruses, ranged between 5% to 18% (table 2). Local blast analyses using BLAST-P or TBLAST-N identified significant matches (as defined by the E value in BLAST) between NS4 proteins encoded by other orbiviruses. Analysis of NS4 protein sequences using the pfam program, which uses the hidden Markov model (HMM) based profiles to identify or predict protein functionalities [31, 32] , revealed strong similarities to certain conserved functional motifs. AHSV NS4 exhibits strong relatedness over almost its entire length with DUF domains that have helical structures known to be involved in nucleic acid binding and/or modification [33] . Previous analysis of GIV NS4 identified a 72 amino acid fragment (aa 82 to 153) with 39% similarity to dsRNA-binding domains of similar length (approximately 68aa) in other reovirus proteins [ [18] or other dsRNA binding proteins [34] . BTV NS4 (77aa long) also exhibits relatedness (over aa 14-54) to a DUF domain, belonging to the MetJ/Arc repressor superfamily [35] , which has a ribbon-ribbonhelix-helix DNA-binding motif, with the beta-ribbon located in and recognising the major groove of operator DNA.",

GIV-NS4 showed sequence similarity to UTP20, a small subunit processome component and a component of the nucleolus. UTP20 is part of the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) protein complex (U3 snoRNP) and is involved in 18S rRNA processing [53] . Whether NS4 interferes with the processing of the 18s rRNA remains to be clarified in future work.",

NS1 and NS3 play an important role in orbivirus exit mechanisms from infected cells [15] . BTV infects mammalian cells, usually resulting in a lytic infection, while infection of KC cells derived from the BTV vector Culicoides sonorensis, become persistently infected with little or no evidence of cell lysis [56, 57] . Previous work showed that intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in BTV infected cells [14] . As a consequence, cells became persistently infected and viruses exited by budding instead of via cell lysis. Although BTV NS3 is effectively expressed in insect cells [15] , it is much less abundant in mammalian cells [4] . It was suggested previously [14] that the relative levels of NS1 to NS3 synthesised during infection dictate the fate of cellular pathogenesis as of whether the virus exit occurs by lysis or budding.",

The presence of the NS4 in the plasma membrane late in infection suggests that it may play a role, alongside NS1 and NS3, in virus exit. Further co-localisation studies will be carried out to assess NS4 interactions with other viral or cellular protein components. ",
