Euro Surveill. 2019;24(45):pii=1900140. https://doi.Background: Well-established influenza surveillance systems (ISS) can be used for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance. In Portugal, RSV cases are detected through the ISS using the European Union (EU) influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition. Aim: To investigate clinical predictors for RSV infection and how three case definitions (EU ILI, a modified EU acute respiratory infection, and one respiratory symptom) performed in detecting RSV infections in Portugal. Methods: This observational retrospective study used epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data (October 2010-May 2018. Associations between clinical characteristics and RSV detection were analysed using logistic regression. Accuracy of case definitions was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A 0.05 significance level was accepted. Results: The study involved 6,523 persons, including 190 (2.9%) RSV cases. Among 183 cases with age information, RSV infection was significantly more frequent among individuals < 5 years (n = 23; 12.6%) and \u2265 65 years (n = 45; 24.6%) compared with other age groups (p < 0.0001). Cough (odds ratio (OR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-6.5) was the best RSV-infection predictor considering all age groups, while shortness of breath was particularly associated with RSV-positivity among \u2264 14 year olds (OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 2.6-17.4 for 0-4 year olds and OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 1.5-28.8 for 5-14 year olds). Systemic symptoms were significantly associated with RSV-negative and influenza-positive cases. None of the case definitions were suitable to detect RSV infections (AUC = 0.51). Conclusion: To avoid underestimating the RSV disease burden, RSV surveillance within the Portuguese sentinel ISS would require a more sensitive case definition than ILI and, even a different case definition according to age.",

Moreover, according to a study in the same year, the global burden of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection has been estimated at 33.1 million annually resulting in over 3.2 million severe illness that required hospitalisation in children younger than 5 years [5] .",

            "text": "Currently, the available options for clinical management of RSV disease are symptomatic supportive care [6] as well as Palivizumab. Palivizumab is a humanised antibody against the F glycoprotein of the virus. It prevents RSV infection and has been shown to reduce the number of hospitalised cases by half [7] . It can also be employed to treat RSV but it does not reduce RSV mortality and its use is limited to selected populations in high-resource settings [6, [8] [9] [10] . Several RSV vaccines are progressing in phase III clinical trials and RSV vaccines are expected to become available in the coming 5 to 10 years. With this perspective, evidence-based support for vaccination policies at the national, regional and global levels is necessary and, in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) made it a high priority to establish robust age-specific estimates of those affected by RSV and globally-compatible RSV-diseaseburden surveillance systems [11] . Many countries however detect RSV infections within existing surveillance systems for influenza [12] [13] . Moreover, one of the challenges to implement a global RSV surveillance system is the lack of a uniform case definition. Influenza case definitions may be less sensitive for RSV and, consequently, have the potential to underestimate the RSV burden [14] . Indeed, a broader ARI case definition, which includes a sudden onset of symptoms and at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or coryza), has been considered to be more suitable for capturing RSV infections [1, 15] .",

Furthermore, none of the evaluated three case definitions was able to discriminate among RSV-positive and negative cases with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically reliable because all these definitions presented an AUC of 0.51. However, the optimal case definition should be determined considering the epidemiological context, available resources, study population and the objective for which it is being used. Only one respiratory symptom showed the highest sensitivity with 99.5%, which may be very good to better understand burden, seasonality and mortality associated with RSV infection. In fact, a very high proportion of hospitalisations are due to respiratory symptoms [21] . For vaccine effectiveness studies, a highly specific case definition would be more suitable [26, 27] and the ILI and ARI-like case definitions showed higher specificities (21.1% and 20.8%, respectively) than only one respiratory symptom, albeit they were low in comparison with previous studies in hospitalised children [12] .",

Firstly, missing symptoms of myalgia and malaise were mostly among individuals aged under 14 years. Secondly, the number of persons of this age group was very low in comparison with other age groups, with only 21 children under 1 year old included in the study, thus not allowing further age-stratified analyses in the 0\u221214 year-old age group. Thirdly, the analysis did not differentiate between inpatients and outpatients and, indeed, most collected information was from outpatients, whose underlying risk factors were unknown. Finally, data were collected based on EU ILI case definition and thereby, individuals presenting only one respiratory symptom might have not been selected to test for any respiratory virus resulting in a selection bias. Therefore, these findings may not be representative for inpatient respiratory disease surveillance and the most severe spectrum of cases with RSV infection. However, we believe that this study may contribute to decide the best option for RSV surveillance in Portugal, especially at a community level, and may help support public health strategies and interventions at a European and global level regarding the prophylaxis and treatment options.",
