Fifteen puppies were evaluated; the pathology reports and histopathologic slides of these animals were reviewed to determine the pattern of histopathologic lesions. The intralesional identification of antigens of canine (distemper) morbillivirus (CDV), canine adenovirus-1 and -2 (CAdV-1 and -2), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum was evaluated by IHC within the histopathologic patterns observed. All puppies contained CDV nucleic acid by molecular testing. The most frequent histopathologic patterns were intestinal crypt necrosis (n = 8), white matter cerebellar demyelination (n = 7), necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis (n = 7), interstitial pneumonia (n = 7), and gallbladder oedema (n = 5). All puppies contained intralesional antigens of CDV in multiple tissues resulting in singular (n = 3), and concomitant dual (n = 3), triple (n = 5) and quadruple (n = 4) infections by CAdV-1, and -2, CPV-2, and N. caninum; T. gondii was not identified. Concomitant infections by CDV was observed with N. caninum (100%; 1/1), CPV-2 (100%; 8/8), CAdV-1 (100%; 8/8), and CAdV-2 (100%; 8/8). Intralesional antigens of CDV and not CAdV-1 were identified in cases of gallbladder oedema. The \"blue eye\" phenomenon was histologically characterized by corneal oedema and degenerative lesions to the corneal epithelium, without inflammatory reactions.",

Consequently, these puppies demonstrated pathologic and histopathologic findings that could be attributed to conventional canine diseases including CD, ICH, parvoviral enteritis, CIRD, and neosporosis. Additionally, antigens of CDV were more frequently identified by IHC in the epithelial cells of the lungs (n = 11), predominantly in the white matter of the cerebellum (n = 5), and brainstem (n = 4) of these puppies (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). It must be highlighted that CDV antigens were only identified from five dogs with a histopathologic diagnosis of white matter demyelination. Furthermore, antigens of CDV were identified in the epithelial cells of the intestine (enterocytes and dilated/necrotic crypts) of two puppies that were simultaneously infected with CPV-2. This widespread distribution of CDV antigens in affected organs, demonstrated the tropism of this virus to produce infection in multiple tissues. Molecular findings. The CDV N protein was amplified from the urine and/or brain fragments of all puppies evaluated during this study by RT-PCR assays, sequencing confirmed these results. Furthermore, the amplified products contained the desired 287 base pairs of the partial fragment of the CDV N protein. ",

The location (cytoplasmic or nuclear) for the labelling of the antigens for all infectious disease pathogens observed during this study is consistent with previous studies 26, 36 . During this investigation, 60% (9/15) of the puppies demonstrated triple or quadruple infectious diseases; similar results were described in a population of German Spitz puppies 18 , while a 45-day-old puppy was infected by five pathogens 10 , and triple viral infections were diagnosed in dogs from Mexico by IHC 26 . These findings suggest that concomitant infectious diseases in dogs, principally in puppies, as observed in this and other studies 8,10,12,21,22,26 may be more frequent than previously described, and can result in sudden death, as occurred in all puppies from this study, probably due to multiple organs failure 10 . Although this study was focused on the identification of traditional infectious disease pathogens of dogs, it cannot be ignored that the possibility exists of the occurrence of additional infections associated with emerging 19,37 infectious disease agents.",

This methodology has the advantage of confirming the participation of infectious disease agents in the development of disease processes, since tissue antigens are easily observed within histological sections 39 . Alternatively, other investigations have used several methods to associate the participation of pathogens with disease in dogs, including the exclusive identification of characteristic histopathologic findings 5, 7 , histopathology with electron microscopy 20 , genotyping 35 , and with the IHC identification of associated pathogens 21, 26, 38 , or histopathology with molecular testing 10, 12 , and in situ hybridization, ISH 12, 27 . Moreover, these investigations have identified the presence of infectious disease pathogens using molecular techniques in symptomatic 9,23,24 , or asymptomatic 19 dogs. Although there are advantages and disadvantages with the utilization of diagnostic IHC 40 , this method is recommended for the identification of intralesional antigens of infectious disease agents in Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections 36, 39, 41 , and has been used extensively in veterinary medicine 39 . Additionally, immunohistochemistry, ISH, and electron microscopy, unlike molecular identification methods, clearly demonstrates the active participation of the infectious disease agent in the development of the disease process, while the molecular identification of disease pathogens does not necessarily imply that the identified pathogen is the cause of the associated disease process 42 .",

These findings demonstrated the disseminated tropism of CDV for epithelia and its capacity to induce clinical disease with associated histopathologic alterations in multiple tissues. The concomitant infections identified in most puppies can be attributed to the immunodepressive effects of this virus 3,4 , associated with the immature immunological system of these puppies, which facilitated the development of simultaneous infections in the same puppy. The immunodepressive effects associated with infections induced by CDV is associated with the selective destruction or impairment of cells that express the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) due to tropism for lymphoid tissues 4 . Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that in cases of fatal CDV-induced infections, as occurred during this study, there are reduced gene expressions of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) 43 . Collectively, reduced expression of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4) and downregulation of CD150 cells may be the key to understand the immunodepressive effects of CDV.",

Most cases of white matter demyelination of the cerebellum during this investigation contained CDV-positive astrocytes; similar findings were described 11, 38 , indicating that these puppies were in the initial phase of neurological distemper in progression to develop canine distemper encephalitis, CDE 2,3,44 . These findings indicate that demyelination continues to be an important histopathologic lesion of neurological distemper 2,3,15 , with the cerebellum being the tissue of choice for the histopathologic diagnosis of CDE in immature dogs, since this neuroanatomical location is frequently affected in CDE 2,44 .",

            "text": "Positive immunolabelling for antigens of CAdV-1 were observed predominantly in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of puppies with a histopathologic diagnosis of necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis and to a lesser extent in cases of interstitial pneumonia; similar findings have been described in ICH 10, [45] [46] [47] [48] . Additionally, gallbladder oedema was observed during the autopsy of several of these puppies during this investigation, as well as in other studies 20, 45, 46 . Moreover, the \"blue eye\" phenomenon and gallbladder oedema observed in one puppy are considered as typical clinical findings associated with CAdV-1 30, 33, 49, 50 . Intriguingly, positive immunolabelling to CAdV-1 was observed within hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells but not at the oedematous epithelium of the gallbladder in any of these cases, while there was positive immunoreactivity to CDV at the oedematous gallbladder in one of these puppies. These findings might suggest that gallbladder oedema in ICH is not a direct viral-induced lesion but may be associated with CAdV-1 related haemodynamic alterations that are characteristic of this disease 30, 49 , resulting in oedema to the gallbladder but without IHC evidence of this viral pathogen. However, the absence of positive IHC detection of CAdV-1 antigens in these cases can also be related to the clearance of the virus from the gallbladder and be time dependent, since infected dogs develops effective antibody response resulting in virus clearance from the liver seven days post-infection 30 . The authors have not located any manuscript that described this association, so these results are unique and add to the understanding of this important disease of dogs. In addition, the positive labelling of CDV at the oedematous epithelium of the gallbladder may simply represent the widespread tropism of this virus for epithelia and not directly related to the development of oedema at this or any other location. This is one of the few investigations that have evaluated the histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of the \"blue eye\" phenomenon of ICH in modern diagnostic veterinary pathology, and adds to the excellent experimental studies that described the histopathologic features of the ocular disease in the 1960s 31,32 with emphasis in Afghan hounds 51 , experimental confirmation of the type III hypersensitivity lesions 52 , and a review of this unique lesion 50 . This ocular lesion is traditionally considered and accepted as a type III hypersensitivity reaction of CAdV-1 [30] [31] [32] 50, 53 , and occurs in 20% of recovered puppies after 2-3 weeks of being infected 31, 32, 53 . However, in the case herein descried (puppy #15) as well as the eye from a previous study 10 , there was oedema of the corneal stroma with disruption of the anterior corneal epithelium and the Descemet's membrane; these lesions were previously described in experimentally induced CAdV-1 infection puppies in which where there were accumulations of neutrophils, mononuclear inflammatory cells 31, 32, 51 , and fibrinous exudation 31, 32 , frequently resulting in uveitis and interstitial keratitis 31, 32 . However, in the cases herein described, moderate inflammatory reactions were restricted to the conjunctiva of puppy #15 and not observed in any anatomical region of the eye of a puppy from a previous study 10 . Alternatively, degenerative alterations to the corneal epithelium were not described in the experimentally induced ocular disease 31, 32, 52 . Furthermore, the post-infection period of the occurrence of corneal oedema in ICH seems to coincide with the initial manifestations of hepatocelular necrosis 30, 49 . However, in puppy #15 with the \"blue eye\" phenomena, hepatocellular swelling (hydropic degeneration) and not hepatocellular necrosis was the predominant histopathologic pattern with positive immunoreactivity observed only within epithelial cells of bile ducts. While in puppy #16, there was necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies characteristic of CAdV-1, with the hepatic disease being further aggravated due to the concomitant presence of intralesional cysts of T. gondii 10 . Additionally, the hepatocellular alteration as observed in puppy #15 is frequently described in ICH 49 , and may be associated with reduction in levels of blood glucose 33 . Consequently, it is proposed that CAdV-1 should be considered as a possible cause of hepatocellular degenerative lesions in puppies, principally those that have died after an acute onset of clinical manifestations.",

            "text": "Collectively, these findings may suggest that the histopathologic features of the ocular lesions associated with CAdV-1 seem to be predominantly degenerative in the spontaneous disease herein described and inflammatory in experimental-induced infections. Although the differences in histopathologic findings observed between the spontaneous ocular disease and the experimentally induced lesions 32,52,54 are not fully known, we postulate that these differences might have occurred due to several factors. Firstly, they may be related to the routes of inoculation in the experimental studies; being subcutaneous and intravascular 31, 51 or intraocular 32, 52 , as compared to the oronasal exposure in the natural disease. Secondly, the post-inoculation observation period of 2-3 weeks 31 relative to the one week after initial manifestation of disease in the spontaneous disease can also contribute to these histopathologic differences. Furthermore, these time-based differences can be related to the pattern of histopathologic lesion observed in ICH. The hepatic pattern observed in puppy #15 was degenerative and not necrotic, and may probably represent an initial manifestation of hepatocellular injury induced by CAdV-1, since hepatocelular degeneration is commonly observed in ICH 49 , and antigens of CAdV-1 were identified in another puppy with this pattern of hepatic injury. Thirdly, the viral load used in the experimentally induced infectious studies might have been significantly elevated when compared to that of the spontaneous exposure of susceptible puppies to CAdV-1. Notwithstanding the above findings, two inflammatory phases of the CAdV-1 associated ocular disease were proposed 50, 52, 55 : the first is considered as a subclinical/clinical infection that is characterized principally by oedema with mononuclear accumulations and occurs at the anterior uvea, while the second is predominantly manifested by corneal oedema with histopathologic lesions indicative of type III hypersensitivity and results in keratouveitis. However, these phases are based on the results of experimental induced studies and not on the spontaneous occurrence of this unique ocular disease. Nevertheless, additional spontaneous cases of the \"blue eye\" phenomenon are required to efficiently characterize and understand the histopathologic findings of the ocular lesions in puppies naturally infected by CAdV-1.",

In this case, the puppy did not demonstrate clinical manifestations suggestive of muscular disease; therefore, canine toxoplasmosis and not neosporosis was suspected, since T. gondii is frequently identified in dogs infected by CDV 9,10 . This puppy contained CDV RNA by RT-PCR, with additional positive immunolabelling for CDV, CAdV-2 and CPV-2, resulting in a quadruple infection; five infectious disease agents including T. gondii and CDV were diagnosed in puppy 10 . Moreover, coinfections of Leishmania chagasi, N. caninum, and T. gondii have been investigated in dogs, where it was suggested that the immunodepressive effects of L. chagasi might have influenced infections by N. caninum and T. gondii 58 . Therefore, one wonders if the known immunodepressive effects of CDV 4 might have favoured the development of the protozoan infection in this puppy. This case represents one of the few documented reports of coinfections involving CDV and N. caninum in dogs. A clinical study demonstrated seropositivity to N. caninum in a dog with neurological manifestations and the simultaneous molecular identification of CDV nucleic acid 9 . Nevertheless, additional studies confirming concomitant infections involving these two infectious disease agents are required to efficiently evaluate this intriguing relationship.",

These findings suggest that CAdV-2 can be associated with extra-pulmonary disease and that the occurrence of this pathogen should be investigated in multiple tissue of dogs. Additionally, the widespread identification of CAdV-2 in multiple organs and in several puppies can be associated with the immunosuppressive effects of CDV 2 , since all puppies were simultaneously infected by both pathogens.",

However, when the head conformation of purebred dogs was analysed, brachycephalic breeds were more frequently affected relative to dolichocephalic dogs; similar findings were described in an epidemiological study of 250 dogs naturally infected by CDV 16 . Moreover, it was proposed that brachycephalic breeds are more predisposed to develop CD 60 , other neurological disorders, ocular and facial dysfunctions 61 when compared to dolichocephalic dogs. Although the actual reason for this breed predisposition to develop diseases has not been fully elucidated, phenotypical head conformations of brachycephalic dogs was suggested as a possible reason due to differences in the orientation of the olfactory bulb in these specific breeds of dogs 61 . Additionally, dysfunctions to the olfactory bulb have been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases in humans due to the accumulations of pathologic proteins, \u03b1-synuclein, and neurofilament protein in the affected areas 62 . Consequently, it can be theorized that brachycephalic breeds of dogs are more likely to develop neurological disease, including CD, relative to their dolichocephalic counterparts, due to predisposed genetic confirmations at the olfactory bulb. Nevertheless, studies are needed to confirm the possible existence of histological differences at the olfactory bulb of brachycephalic and dolichocephalic breeds of dogs.",

Canine morbillivirus (CDV) continues to be one of the most important infectious disease agents of puppies and due to its immunosuppressive effects can facilitate the development of other infectious disease pathogens. The histopathologic pattern observed in the spontaneous cases of the \"blue eye\" phenomenon associated with infection by CAdV-1 in ICH was predominantly degenerative in nature. Antigens of CAdV-1 were not detected in association with gallbladder oedema in multiple animals from this study. Hepatocellular degeneration may be an initial degenerative phase of infections associated with CAdV-1, particularly in puppies that died suddenly. Interstitial pneumonia in dogs should be associated with multiple viral infectious disease pathogens, and several infectious disease pathogens must be included in the differential diagnosis during the investigation of the cause of death in puppies.",

Only sections of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, lung, small intestine, eye, and liver were evaluated during this study. These organs were selected for analyses due to: 1) all were present in each puppy; 2) the infectious disease agents investigated are known to produce specific histopathologic pattern(s) in these organs; and 3) to maintain the uniformity of the pathologic investigation. In addition, when available, the target organs (e.g., eye, thymus, palatine tonsils, and urinary bladder) of these viral agents were also revised. Furthermore, the eye of a puppy with the \"blue eye\" phenomenon from a previous study in which five infectious disease agents were identified 10 was evaluated for histopathologic findings associated with CAdV-1, since in that previous study 10 the histopathologic features of the ocular lesions were not described.",
