Consequently, new challenges have emerged, including: border-related conflicts, food security risk due to declines agricultural production, vectorand water-borne diseases, (especially in areas with inadequate health infrastructure), flooding and exacerbation of desertification by changes in rainfall and intensified land use [2] . Predictions related to water resources include: (a) decreased rainfalls in portions of the Sahel, (b) increased rainfalls in east central Africa, (c) increased temperature ranging from 0.2\u00b0C to >0.5\u00b0C per decade, especially in the semi-arid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa [6] . Some studies have also suggested that major climate change will influence water resource use, natural resources management and biodiversity, human health, food security, resettlement and infrastructure re-allocation, and desertification [2, 6] . Variance in climatic conditions will impact significantly on disease ecology and epidemiology with upsurge in human-animal disease conditions due decreased salinity of the soil which can increase the number of toxic bacteria and breeding sites for mosquitoes and rodents.",

Endemic antimicrobial-resistant Africa will need to prioritize rapid detection, prompt response to ErEIDs, optimize the benefit of geospatial epidemiology in policy decisions and utilize interdisciplinary educational programs. ) . Intense human-animal interactions, and consumption of non-certified pathogen-free animal products facilitate the spread of zoonoses pathogens come with heavy clinical and economic burdens, especially in the developing countries. Recent review had indicated that endemic infections associated with antimicrobial resistance requires a particular attention because such diseases are linked with approximately 44 to 77% of all annual human deaths in Africa [3] . It has been estimated that, by 2050, more lives will be lost due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) than cancer [3] . One major component of antimicrobial resistance is the overuse of antimicrobials in the production of livestock, which are then passed to humans [3] . Because vaccines reduce the incidence of infectious diseases (and, therefore, antibiotic use), immunisations might reduce AMR [1, 3, 7] .",

For example, the Critical Response Time (CRT or time available to implement effective epidemic control measures) should be considered in decision-making [1, 5] . That is so because for any intervention to be very effective (\u2248 100%), it must be deployed under a realist timeframe; if it requires a longer period of time, it will necessarily be (i) less effective (if not ineffective), and (ii) more expensive [5] . CRT may or may not include geo-referenced data. When it lacks geographical data, it becomes much shorter, making useless almost any intervention. Thus, the real significance of CRT is that it should be expanded (giving decision-makers more time to complete interventions) \u2212 which can only be achieved when high-resolution geo-referenced epidemiologic data are analyzed in time and space. Thus, to achieve improved epidemic control measures, geographically explicit data should be collected from epidemics, analysed and lessons learnt made available for future interventions. Only such (local or regional) data can support scientifically valid decision-making. Yet, even recent epidemics have been addressed with ad hoc policies, such as the classic '3-km radius control rings' -which assume all epidemics (ie, all pathogens, all host species, and all local geographies) are identical [1] [2] [3] . Failure to consider local bio-geo-epidemiological information has led to widespread dissemination of major epidemics, such as Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [8] .",
