However, there are a number of issues listed below that will need to be solved prior publication. 1) A quantitative assessment of IGF-1R surface levels upon treatment with Lec B is needed as the PM staining in Fig. 2B are not totally clear, with a lot of background signal. A more quantitative measurement of IGF-1R surface levels at steady state and upon Lec B treatment at different time points should be provided (e.g. by FACS). A parallel treatment with L-fucose would be a critical control for LecB specificity in causing IGF-1R downmodulation from the cell surface. 2) A time course of intracellular IGF-1R accumulation upon LecB treatment should also be shown in addition to surface to prove that disappearance from the PM is paralleled by the IGF-1R accumulation in intracellular compartments (i.e. endocytosis).",

            "text": "3) The authors suggest that IGF-1R might be degraded upon LecB, as they showed that the IGF-1R fraction bound to LecB decreased over-time (Fig. S6A ). This is a very interesting and important data that should be moved in main figures. However, authors need to prove that this decreased is really due to degradation by performing treatment with lysosome inhibitor (e.g. chloroquine or Bafilomycin) to show that IGF-1R levels are restored. Did the authors check whether total IGF-1R levels (not only the bound fraction) decrease over time upon LecB incubation? Please show total levels of IGF-1R receptor in Fig. 3B . 4) The data that the fraction of ubiquitinated protein bound to LecB increased over time is intriguing (Fig. S6B) . Is IGF-1R itself ubiquitinated upon LecB? This would be a very interesting data as it would indicate that the mechanism of LecB induced endocytosis of IGF1R could be mediated by ubiquitin, which is indeed a critical internalization and sorting signal toward a degradative compartment. 5) The data on LC3 are very interesting, but incomplete. The authors proposed that LecB mediates LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), as they observed an in increase in LC3-II but they could not observe autophagosomal double-membrane structures. To prove this, authors should show, for instance, that their pathway is sensitive to Vps34-KD (or to phagocytosis inhibitors) but not to inhibition of autophagosome formation (treatment with 3-Methyladenine or FIP200 KD, see Florey et al, NCB 2011).",

            "text": "Minor points 1) Please note that the acronym for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is EGFR and not EGF-1R. 2) Since the other RTKs found in the mass spec are not further investigated in the manuscript, I would change the sentence in the abstract and along the manuscript 'LecB associates with several growth factor receptors and dampens their signaling pathway', as it is not shown. This work focuses on the effect of P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes. They found that LecB co-immunoprecipitated with several growth factor receptors : EGFR, Met, and IGF1,2R. They also showed that LecB induced IGF-1R internalization without activating the receptor (MAPK, mTor), in contrast to its natural ligand (IGF-1). Instead LecB induced cell cycle arrest. Finally the authors investigated LecB-mediated endocytosis and showed that it induced LC3 positive vesicles where IGF-1R co-localized and that LecB could also be found associatd to Lamp1 and Rab9 but not to recycling endosomes. Consistently, EM data showed that LecB was associated to membrane ruffles and internalized into degradative vesicles especially in intralumenal vesicles. Overall the study proposes a new function of LecB that would be to induce the endocytosis and degradation of some signaling receptors, hence swhitching off keratinocyte proliferation and survival. The work is very interesting, although it does not describe the full mechanism of LecB action. Moreover, each point sum up above are supported by strong data.",

            "text": "3-About the endocytosis part, I wonder whether this LecB-induced endocytosis and sorting of the receptors to the degradation can be used by other receptors than IGF1R, Met, EGFR. Indeed, these 3 signaling receptors are known to be endocytosed via a clathrin-independent process (Boucrot et al, 2015). It would be very interesting to determine if other cargo like Transferrin receptor (TfR, endocytosed by a clathrin-dependent route, not signaling and always recycling) is uptaken into LC3-positive vesicles upon LecB treatment. This will allow at drawing a clearer mechanism of LecB action on signalling receptor trafficking pathway. In Fig. 5 We appreciate the experimental suggestion. However, it is not possible to investigate the surface expression of IGF-1R via FACS, as LecB induces a strong attachment of the cells to plates (even after 30 minutes exposure), making cell detachment only possible by scraping, which affects the integrity of the plasma membrane. Therefore, we employed cell surface biotinylation to measure the surface and intracellular levels of the receptor at any given time. These experiments confirmed a time-dependent loss of the receptor from the plasma membrane, which can be blocked by L-fucose supplementation (Fig S2A, B) . Combining cell surface biotinylation and western blot, we had respectively quantified the intracellular receptor levels upon LecB treatment and discriminated between IGF-1R and its precursor form. These results show an intracellular decrease of IGF-1R, which is concomitant with an increase of the precursor form. This suggests, on one hand, a degradation of the receptor and on the other, the activation of a cellular response to compensate the receptor depletion (Fig S2C, D) . Besides, immunofluorescence experiments showed both a redistribution of the receptor, which forms accumulations in LAMP-1-positive compartments over time, and a strong increase of lysosomes upon LecB treatment (Fig S1C, D) .",

To address whether the decrease of IGF-1R is due to lysosomal degradation, we blocked lysosomal turnover with bafilomycin A1. As expected, treatment with bafilomycin A1 alone increased the IGF-1R levels. Combined treatment of bafilomycin A1 and LecB after 3 h partially counteracted LecB-evoked IGF-1R degradation. These new results demonstrate a decrease of the total levels of the receptor after 3 h of LecB treatment, which is only partially restored by bafilomycin A1 treatment (Fig S1E, F) . The incomplete recovery indicates that LecB might use additional pathways, to lysosomal degradation (e.g. proteasome), to deplete the receptor.",

            "text": "the authors could add another experiment showing TfR endocytosis and intracellular trafficking upon LecB treatment as compared to IGF1R.Reviewer #1Landi et al. studied the effects of the exposure of Lectin B (LecB) from P. aeruginosa on human keratinocytes. LecB associates with IGF-1R (and possibly with other RTKs, like EGFR) and downregulates its surface level upon long term treatment, without causing receptor kinase activation. It also causes a decreased Erk signalling activation and cell cycle arrest. The authors proposed that LecB induces internalization of IGF-1R and its trafficking towards a lamp1-positive, LC3-positive, compartment, leading to reduced signaling.The manuscript tackled an important issue in cell biology, and unveils an interesting and novel mechanism of action of LecB to dampen proliferation and survival in the host cells.However, there are a number of issues listed below that will need to be solved prior publication.1) A quantitative assessment of IGF-1R surface levels upon treatment with LecB isneeded as the PM staining inFig. 2Bare not totally clear, with a lot of background signal. A more quantitative measurement of IGF-1R surface levels at steady state and upon LecB treatment at different time points should be provided (e.g. by FACS). A parallel treatment with L-fucose would be a critical control for LecB specificity in causing IGF-1R downmodulation from the cell surface.",
