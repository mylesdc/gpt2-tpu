Here, we examined the activity of blood Vpr using an assay system by which retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (L1-RTP) was detected. We also investigated the in vivo effects of recombinant Vpr (rVpr) by administrating it to transgenic mice harboring human L1 as a transgene (hL1-Tg mice). Based on our data, we discuss the involvement of blood Vpr in the clinical symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).",

Biochemical analyses revealed that rVprinduced L1-RTP depended on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein \u03b2. By using a sensitive L1-RTP assay system, we showed that 6 of the 15 blood samples from HIV-1 patients examined were positive for induction of L1-RTP. Of note, the L1-RTP-inducing activity was blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for Vpr. Moreover, L1-RTP was reproducibly induced in various organs, including the kidney, when rVpr was administered to hL1-Tg mice.",

Vpr has a variety of biological functions, including cell cycle abnormalities at the G 2 /M phase and apoptosis of T cells and neuronal cells (for a recent review, see ref. [2] ). Notably, it was shown that Vpr was present in the blood of HIV-1-positive patients [3] , and we previously reported that 20 of 52 blood samples from HIV-1-positive patients examined were positive for Vpr [4] . Blood Vpr was detected in patients with high titres of HIV-1 and, interestingly, was also detected in patients with low viral titres [4] . On the other hand, purified recombinant Vpr protein (rVpr) functions as a trans-acting factor [5, 6] , and rVpr activated viral replication in latently infected cells by increasing production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by monocytes [7] . Further analyses revealed that rVpr-induced IL-6 production depended on p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP-\u03b2) [7] . These observations suggest that blood Vpr could induce various clinical symptoms, but it remained unclear whether blood Vpr is biologically active.",

            "text": "Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) and Alu are major endogenous retroelements, accounting for~17 and~10% of the human genome, respectively [8, 9] . As an autonomous retroelement, L1 can retrotranspose not only itself but also other retroelements, such as Alu and SVA (short interspersed element-variable number tandem repeat-Alu, SINE-VNTR-Alu). Intriguingly, a single human cell contains more than 5 \u00d7 10 5 copies of L1, 80-100 of which are competent for retrotransposition (L1-RTP) [10] . During early embryogenesis, L1-RTP incidentally disrupts gene structures, leading to the development of inborn errors [11, 12] . Of note, approximately 100 types of inheritable diseases have been identified as sporadic cases caused by mutagenic RTP of L1 or Alu [12] . Although most studies of L1-RTP have focused on early embryogenesis [13] [14] [15] [16] , recent lines of evidence suggest that L1-RTP is also induced in somatic cells [17] [18] [19] [20] . In tumors of epithelial-cell origins and hepatomas, de novo L1 insertions were detected in the vicinity of tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that L1-RTP is actively involved in carcinogenesis [21, 22] . Because L1-RTP alters cellular properties by causing various genetic alternations, including gene deletions [23, 24] , DNA damage [25] , apoptosis [26] and immune responses [27] , deregulation of L1-RTP in somatic cells likely functions as a trigger of various diseases.",

Interestingly, rVpr reproducibly induced L1-RTP in various organs, including the kidney, when administered to mice that harbored human L1 as a transgene (hL1-Tg mice) [28, 29] . Clinically, HIV-1-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), which is mainly observed among African-Americans [30] , is an end-stage renal deficiency that is found without apparent correlation with the viral load [31, 32] . In view of reports that Vpr is a candidate molecule responsible for HIVAN [33, 34] , we propose that monitoring blood levels of Vpr is important for determining its involvement in the pathogenesis of HIVAN.",

When HuH-7 human hepatoma cells were treated with rVpr, L1-RTP occurred in approximately 50 of 10 5 cells ( Figure 1C , P < 0.02). rVpr caused no apparent cytotoxicity (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The activity of rVpr was also confirmed by a PCR-based assay using pEF06R [37, 38] , in which the signal intensity of the 140 bp band, which corresponds to a product of L1-RTP, was increased by treatment with rVpr ( Figure 1B , lower panel for the rationale of the PCR-based assay and 1D, lane 2). A quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was also carried out using a TaqMan probe designed to detect a junction point of two exons of the EGFP gene ( Figure 1B , bottom; see also Additional file 2: Figure S2 for standard qPCR curves). Data revealed that rVpr significantly increased the frequency of L1-RTP ( Figure 1E , P < 0.05). Notably, rVpr-induced L1-RTP was completely blocked by 8D1 and C217, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Vpr ( Figure 1D , lanes 5 and 6) [4] , but not by an irrelevant mAb against a spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( Figure 1D , lane 4, SARS). Vpr-induced L1-RTP was also observed in HEK293T cells, in which the activity of~1 ng/mL rVpr was detected ( Figure 1F , lanes 10-12; Additional file 3: Figure S3 ).",

Among 15 samples analyzed by a PCR assay, 6 were positive for L1-RTP induction ( Figure 2A , upper panel; patients' clinical information is summarized in Additional file 4: Table S1 ). Notably, L1-RTP activity was selectively blocked by 8D1, indicating that the L1-RTP activity in HIV-1 patients is attributable to Vpr ( Figure 2B and C). Interestingly, Vpr-induced L1-RTP was detected in patients with low HIV-1 titres ( Figure 2D and Additional file 4: Table S1 ). To confirm this, we carried out immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (IP-WB analysis), and successfully detected Vpr in one of two blood samples that were positive for L1-RTP (no. 15; Additional file 5: Figure S4 , arrowhead). Estimated concentration of the blood Vpr, when compared to the signals of standard rVpr, would be approximately 5 ng/mL (Additional file 5: Figure S4 ). In contrast, we could not detect Vpr in another sample (no. 1).",

            "text": "To determine the effects of rVpr in vivo, we next investigated L1-RTP after administration of rVpr to hL1-Tg mice ( Figure 1B , solid line). As shown in Figure 3A , L1-RTP was detected in organs including the lymph nodes, liver, thymus and spleen upon intraperitoneal administration of~200 ng of rVpr three times every 2 days (Additional file 6: Table S2 ). Interestingly, the qPCR analysis detected L1-RTP in the kidney after six intravenous administrations of 10 ng of rVpr ( Figure 3B ). To demonstrate that rVpr-induced L1-RTP was dependent on the reverse transcriptase activity of ORF2 [9] , we first carried out in vitro experiments to examine whether rVpr-induced L1-RTP was blocked by nucleotide analogue inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RTIs) [39, 40] . As shown in Figure 3C , stavudine (d4T) and tenofovir inhibited the rVpr activity for L1-RTP induction (lanes 3 and 4), but lamivudine (3TC) and azidothymidine (AZT) did not (lanes 1 and 2). The inhibitory effects of d4T on rVpr-induced L1-RTP were potent, and the compound could effectively block the induction of L1-RTP at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM (Additional file 7: Figure S5 ). We next investigated the effects of 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-3\u2032-deoxy-4\u2032ethynylthymidine (4\u2032-Ed4T), a stavudine analogue with more specific activity as an RTI and fewer side effects [41] . As shown in Figure 3D , 50 \u03bcmoles of 4\u2032-Ed4T, when administered intraperitoneally 2 h before intravenous administration of 250 ng of rVpr, efficiently attenuated L1-RTP (compare lanes 2 and 3). qPCR analysis also clearly showed the inhibitory effects of 4\u2032-Ed4T ( Figure 3E ).",

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that AhR functions as a cellular factor responsible for rVpr-induced L1-RTP. To prove this, we first assessed the effects of 3\u2032-methoxy-4\u2032-nitroflavone (MNF), an AhR inhibitor [48] , and observed that 10 \u03bcM MNF completely blocked rVpr-induced L1-RTP (Additional file 9: Figure S7 ). Moreover, downregulation of endogenous AhR expression by AhR siRNA was accompanied by reduced rVpr-induced L1-RTP (see Figure 5A , lane 4, and 5B for a representative result from experiments using two different AhR siRNAs; see also Additional file 10: Figure S8A and B for data obtained using another AhR siRNA). By contrast, downregulation of ARNT1 by siRNA ( Figure 5C ) did not attenuate L1-RTP ( Figure 5D , lane 9 and Additional file 10: Figure S8D , lane 9). AhR and ARNT1 form a heterodimer (AHR complex) and are involved in the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression in response to environmental pollutants [49] . Both AhR and ARNT1 siRNAs blocked the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression by 6-formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan photoproduct (Additional file 11: Figure S9 ), indicating that each siRNA efficiently inhibited the functional properties of the AHR complex, further suggesting that rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on AhR, but not ARNT1.",

            "text": "Chromatin recruitment of ORF1 induced by rVpr is dependent on AhR L1 encodes two proteins, open reading frame-1 (ORF1) and ORF2, which are~40 and~150 kDa, respectively, and are present in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes and cytoplasmic stress granules [50, 51] . Moreover, L1-RTP is initiated by target-primed reverse transcription within the genome [9] , and ORF1 functions as a nucleic acid chaperone during L1-RTP [52] . These observations suggest that ORF1 is recruited to the chromatin fraction in response to rVpr treatment. To demonstrate chromatin recruitment of ORF1, we transfected a plasmid DNA that encodes ORF1 into HuH-7 cells, and then carried out WB analysis of the chromatin fraction of the transfected cells after treatment of rVpr. The rVpr-induced chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by MAPK inhibitors examined ( Figure 7A , lanes 4 and 6) and the AhR siRNA ( Figure 7B , lane 4; see also Additional file 13: Figure S11 for results from an independent experiment performed using a different AhR siRNA). To further show that ORF1 and AhR form a complex, we transfected a plasmid DNA encoding a chimeric protein of ORF1 and EGFP (pORF1-EGFP) into HuH-7 cells, and then performed IP-WB analysis. IP using \u03b1-AhR followed by WB analysis using \u03b1-EGFP revealed that ORF1 and AhR were associated ( Figure 7C, lane 2) . The reverse experiment, in which IP using \u03b1-EGFP was followed by WB using \u03b1-AhR, confirmed formation of this complex ( Figure 7C , lane 5). The interaction between ORF1 and AhR was also detected in cells in which both ORF1 and ORF2 proteins were expressed exogenously (Additional file 14: Figure S12 ). Previously, we reported that FICZ is a potent activator of L1-RTP, and that its activity was dependent on ARNT1, but not on AhR [37] . To determine the functional link between ORF1 and ARNT1, we performed IP-WB analysis after transfecting pORF1-EGFP into HuH-7 cells. ORF1 was detected in an extract of cells treated with FICZ and was recovered using \u03b1-ARNT1 ( Figure 7D , upper panel, lane 10). By contrast, it was not recovered from extracts of cells treated with rVpr using \u03b1-ARNT1 ( Figure 7D, upper panel, lane 12) . Consistent results were obtained in a reverse experiment, in which WB using \u03b1-ARNT1 was performed on a sample recovered by IP using \u03b1-EGFP ( Figure 7D, lower panel) . In this case, the cell extract obtained after FICZ treatment yielded a positive signal ( Figure 7D, lower panel, lane 10) . These data suggest that the association between ORF1 and ARNT1 is induced by exogenous FICZ but not rVpr.",

We confirmed by in vitro experiments that rVpr did not increase expression of L1 mRNA or the splicing efficiency of an immature EGFP transcript derived from the reporter L1 construct (Additional file 15: Figure S13 ). Moreover, no apparent changes in the CpG methylation status were observed in the 5\u2032UTR of the exogenous hL1 gene in the kidneys of hL1-Tg mice that had been treated with rVpr (Additional file 8: Figure S6 ). Our data suggest that rVpr-induced L1-RTP is controlled at the post-transcriptional level, although it has been proposed that L1-RTP is influenced at the transcriptional level by the methylation status of the L1-5\u2032UTR [53, 54] .",

A PCR-based assay revealed that the \u0394C12 mutant was not active for the induction of L1-RTP (Additional file 16: Figure S14 ). It has been shown that Vpr has an affinity for nucleic acids, which is attributable to the basic moiety in the C-terminal region of Vpr [55] . To exclude the possibility that the induction of AhRdependent L1-RTP by Vpr depends on binding to nucleic acids, we investigated the interaction between Vpr and AhR after nuclease treatment. IP-WB analysis combined with treatment with benzonase, a nuclease that degrades both DNA and RNA, revealed that their interaction was not reduced (Additional file 17: Figure S15A ). Additionally, ORF1 and AhR constitutively formed a complex, and their interaction was also resistant to nuclease treatment (Additional file 17: Figure S15B ). Moreover, rVpr triggered chromatin recruitment of ORF1 in an AhR-dependent manner ( Figure 7B ). Taken together, these data suggest that Vpr functions as an AhR ligand, and activates a cellular cascade for the induction of L1-RTP.",

Interestingly, we previously examined blood Vpr by IP-WB analysis, and detected Vpr in 20 of 52 blood samples from HIV-1 patients [4] . Interestingly, the positive frequencies observed in these two sets of experiments are comparable, but greater numbers of samples are needed to conclude that blood Vpr is exclusively biologically active. Although it was reported that an antibody against Vpr is present in patients' blood [56] , and implied that Vpr activity would be blocked by such autoantibodies, our current experiments proved that blood Vpr is active for the induction of L1-RTP. Because L1-RTP can alter cellular properties by inducing DNA damage and apoptosis [9] , it is tempting to speculate that blood Vpr can modify clinical outcomes of AIDS patients.",

We observed that administration of rVpr induced L1-RTP in various organs, such as the lymph nodes and spleen. Additionally, we found that Vpr also induced L1-RTP in the kidney ( Figure 4A and Additional file 6: Table S2 ). Notably, even a single injection of 250 ng of rVpr into the tail vein induced L1-RTP in the kidneys ( Figure 4A , right panels), suggesting that the kidney is a target organ of Vpr-induced L1-RTP. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Vpr induced L1-RTP in RTECs, especially in proximal RTECs ( Figure 4D ). Previously, it was reported that Vpr and Nef are candidate mediators of HIVAN: forced expression of these viral genes in mouse podocytes resulted in proteinuria and glomerular diseases [34] . Although it was proposed that renal dysfunction is a direct effect of primary HIV-1 infection in RTECs [58] , it remains to be investigated whether repeated administration of rVpr causes renal insufficiency. HIVAN develops mostly in people of African descent, and shows the strong influence of genetic traits [59] [60] [61] . However, its mechanism remained completely unknown. Importantly, HIVAN has no apparent correlation to viral load [31] , and, intriguingly, it has been proposed that the kidneys are a latent reservoir of HIV-1 [62, 63] . Based on these observations, it is plausible that both bloodcirculating Vpr and Vpr secreted locally from a latent reservoir (the kidney, for example) attack RTECs. To prove this, further studies are required to determine whether the kidney is an organ from which Vpr is constitutively secreted.",

By analysis of tumors using second-generation sequencing technology, de novo L1 insertions were detected in the vicinity of tumor suppressor genes [21, 22] , suggesting that L1 insertion was actively involved in carcinogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that de-regulation of L1-RTP is positively linked to the development of autoimmune diseases [27] . Although these lines of evidence revealed that L1-RTP is induced in somatic cells and is involved in the development of human diseases, it remained unclear how L1-RTP is induced in somatic cells. It was previously reported that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP), a food-borne carcinogen, induced L1-RTP in the mouse mammary gland, a target organ of carcinogenesis, when it was administered orally to hL1-Tg mice [29] . Given that PhIP is present in broiled meat [64] and has been detected in human breast milk [65] , it is plausible that humans are susceptible to the induction of L1-RTP by environmental factors. Further study is required to demonstrate the activity of L1-RTP under pathological conditions, enabling the roles of L1-RTP in disease development to be specified.",

Thus, occurrence of L1-RTP was determined by evaluating the size of the amplified product [28, 29, 37] . After staining of amplified DNA with SYBR Green I (LONZA, Basel, Switzerland), signal intensities of the 140 bp bands were measured using a molecular imager (FX-PRO; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized by the signal intensity of the \u03b2-actin band, used as the internal control.

These two lines were selected because they display low background L1-RTP during embryogenesis but respond vigorously to environmental compounds [29] . The CpG island of the 5\u2032 untranslated region of introduced human L1 (L1-5\u2032UTR) was highly methylated in #4 and #67 mice, as assessed by a PCR-based assay using methylation-specific primers [29] .
