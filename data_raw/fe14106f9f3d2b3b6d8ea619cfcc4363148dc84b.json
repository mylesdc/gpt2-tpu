Twenty-five PRRSV-seronegative piglets were used. At 1 day of age, pigs were administered with a single dose of vaccine via the IM (n = 10) or the IN route (n = 10).

IFN-\u03b1 was detected in all vaccinated pigs following vaccination, indicating the potential for development of an effective Th1 adaptive immune response.

The innate immune system is the first mechanism of defence to prevent viral invasion and replication and influences the adaptive response of the immune system. Adequate early activation of the innate immune system is critical to initiate generation of protective adaptive immunity to achieve complete viral clearance [2] . However, PRRSV induces a slow and weak innate response [1] . The quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV, like IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, appeared to be significantly lower than in pigs infected with Influenza A virus or Porcine respiratory coronavirus [3] [4] [5] . The development of neutralising antibodies (NA) is also known to occur later in the course of the infection although non-neutralising antibodies appear by 7-14 days post-inoculation [6] . In that way, both humoral and cell-mediated specific immunity are delayed, compromising clearance of the virus [7] .",

Using the same antibody transfer system, a titre of 1/8 or higher protected piglets against the development of viraemia, with sterilising immunity being obtained at titres of 1/32 [9] . These results suggest that a vaccine capable of inducing NA titres of 1/32 against a given PRRSV strain should prevent the clinical disease produced by it and could be an important tool in the control of PRRSV [10] . It has to be taken into account, however, that these studies used a homologous challenge model. Despite the significant role that NAs seem to play in protection, their effectiveness might be limited against heterologous isolates, as demonstrated by the limited ability of PRRSV hyperimmune sera to effectively neutralise a variety of heterologous strains [11] .",

Control pigs (T01) had low to undetectable NA titres throughout the study. All vaccinated pigs developed some level of NA after vaccination and before challenge. In pigs vaccinated by the IM route (T02), NA were first detected at Day 56 after vaccination ",

            "text": "PRRSV is known to interact with the immune system of the host and to modulate the immune response after infection. PRRSV induces a slow and weak innate immune response [3, 4] , and a delayed adaptive immune response [1, 6, 15] . The objective of this study was to characterise the development of the innate, humoral and cell mediated immune responses to PRRSV after vaccination of 1-day-old na\u00efve pigs with a PRRSV-1 based MLV vaccine by the IM and IN routes, before and after challenge with a PRRSV-1 isolate at 18 weeks post-vaccination. Levels of cytokines IL-10, IL-8, IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, as well as levels of NA, were measured. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which has been linked to regulatory T cell activity and to decreased cellmediated immune responses, by inhibiting the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 [18] . It has been hypothesised that in some strains of PRRSV the induction of IL-10 pushes the immune response towards a relatively ineffective induction of IFN-\u03b3 specific response [19] . In this study, the induction of detectable levels of IL-10 was rare, both after vaccination and after challenge. During the post-vaccination phase, a Titres are expressed as the inverse of the highest dilution at which NA activity is detected. DC day of challenge, ND non-detectable (below limit of detection of the technique), NS non-significant single pig (from the IN-vaccinated group) showed induction of a low level of IL-10 (10.9 pg/mL). After challenge with the Olot/91 strain, four pigs were positive for IL-10 with levels up to 346.6 pg/mL. The near absence of measurable IL-10 induction by the vaccine virus indicates that vaccination did not induce any significant response attributable to this regulatory cytokine, either in the period of innate response (day 3) or in later stages of the trial. IL-10 mediated immunomodulation/ immune dysfunction was not a general feature of this vaccine strain, as demonstrated by induction of a high number of IFN-\u03b3-SC. This is a positive feature of the vaccine strain, since IL-10 has been related to an inhibition of the development of an effective immune response against PRRSV [10] . IL-8 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces chemotaxis in target cells, primarily neutrophils and other granulocytes, causing them to migrate towards the site of infection [20] . Usually macrophages detect antigen first, and are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Some studies have linked an IL-8 response to enhanced resistance to PRRSV infection [21, 22] . In this study IL-8 was detected in only two pigs following vaccination, and not at all in the non-vaccinated group, suggesting that the vaccine did not generate intense inflammatory reactions. Young pigs have a reduced ability to produce IL-8 in response to an immune stimulation, compared to adults [13] . However, IL-8 was detected in the majority of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs after challenge, indicating that the ability of pigs to produce IL-8 was not impaired after challenge. There were no significant differences between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. The lack of induction of this pro-inflammatory cytokine is consistent with the good safety profile of the vaccine (no systemic or local reactions observed after vaccination; data not shown).",

Interaction of IFN-\u03b1 with receptors on target cells establishes a potent antiviral state. In addition, IFN-\u03b1 serves as an important link between innate and adaptive immunity, and can enhance the development of a strong T helper type 1 (Th1) inflammatory response [1]. IFN-\u03b1 induction has been reported to be weak or absent for some PRRSV strains. The active inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 production, and inhibition of various IFN-induced cellular gene products, has been attributed to specific viral proteins and implicated as a primary cause of the impaired immune responses to the virus [1, 24] . In this study, IFN-\u03b1 was detected in all vaccinated pigs, regardless of route. IFN-\u03b1 levels increased between days 3 and 7 following vaccination, while remaining low in the non-vaccinated control group. These results would be consistent with the development of antiviral responses. Consistent induction of IFN-\u03b1 secretion shortly after vaccination indicates the potential for development of an effective Th1 adaptive immune response dominated by IFN-\u03b3, which was demonstrated by frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-SC in response to the virus well above 100 per million. IFN-\u03b3 (type II interferon) is a pro-immune cytokine that has an ability to inhibit viral replication directly, but its most important function is immunomodulatory. IFN-\u03b3 is the primary cytokine that defines Th1 cells: Th1 cells secrete IFN-\u03b3, as do natural killer (NK) cells. It is considered to be correlated with protection, although IFN-\u03b3 response in PRRSV infected pigs appears to be delayed [7, 25] , and it is considered to be weak, compared to other swine viruses such as Aujeszky's Disease virus [1]. In the current study, IFN-\u03b3-SC were detected in all vaccinated pigs, increased steadily in number between days 28 and 125 post-vaccination, and remained high after challenge (means of 133 and 156 cells/5 \u00d7 10 5 PBMC in the IM and IN treatments, respectively), confirming that vaccination can positively modulate IFN-\u03b3 gene expression and sustain IFN-\u03b3 secretion when cells are re-stimulated [7] . The number of IFN-\u03b3-SC in non-vaccinated pigs remained low.",

Specifically, it was noted that those animals having a high NA titre at challenge were able to clear viraemia in 6-8 days, or even did not become viraemic. One IM-vaccinated animal with a low NA titre at challenge did not become viraemic, but had the highest IFN-\u03b3 response. NA and IFN-\u03b3 responses were measured against the vaccine strain only. Results would likely be different (lower) against a heterologous virus, such as the challenge virus used in this study. However, it is important to establish homologous baseline performance of the vaccine before considering the effects on heterologous cross-reaction on these immunoassays. The ability of the vaccine to protect against this heterologous challenge virus is evident from the viraemia results. The magnitude of the induction of NA and IFN-\u03b3-SC (using homologous antigen) will serve as an important internal control in future studies with other challenge viruses.",

It has been demonstrated that 1 day-old pigs can have a reduced ability to respond to immunological stimulation compared to pigs of weaning age [13] . The present study has demonstrated that piglets vaccinated at 1 day of age can develop innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that are sufficient to protected them from a wild type PRRSV challenge up to at least 16 weeks after vaccination. One explanation for this apparent contradiction is the live nature of this vaccine. The vaccine virus actively replicates for weeks following vaccination, without causing disease, allowing time for the immune system of the neonatal pig to reach a greater level of maturity before eliminating the vaccine virus.",
