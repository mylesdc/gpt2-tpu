We have used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) for broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results indicated that in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per \u00b5L ) whereas sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold greater using virus microarrays. When virus was spiked into a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, whereas virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive, and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in cell lines tested and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A",

Several endogenous retroviruses belonging to alpharetrovirus, betaretrovirus, or gammaretrovirus genera were identified [25, 26] . Avian leukosis virus (ALV) sequences were detected by PLEX-ID in all human cell lines except HeLa. Furthermore, in-depth mass spectrometry analysis of each well, revealed \"unknown\" BCs that were not present in Athogen's curated database. Some of the peaks were found to be potential \"unidentified\" alpharetrovirus sequences, which were compared to Athogen's curated database. The analysis revealed that the BCs for the unidentified alpharetrovirus sequences were near-matches to ALV, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), or human mammary tumor virus (HMTV). This information revealed that the HeLa cell line, which appeared to be free of ALV sequences, did in fact harbor ALV-like sequences with a BC three mutations away from known ALV BCs. In addition, Rous-associated virus 2 (RAV-2)-like sequences were detected in Raji, A204, and HeLa cells. Similarly, unidentified betaretrovirus sequences were detected in all of the human cell lines (Table 3) and the BCs were found to be closely related to known HERV-K BCs. This analysis revealed that A204 and HEK293 were not outliers, but simply harbored an endogenous betaretrovirus whose BC was represented in the curated database, whereas the other human cell lines harbored variants of an endogenous betaretrovirus not found in the curated database. In addition, simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1)-related sequences were detected in A204 and HEK293. Since alpharetroviruses and betaretroviruses were found in all of the human cell lines, a BLAST search was performed using their respective PLEX-ID forward and reverse primer sequences (data not shown). The analysis revealed multiple hits to human chromosomes, suggesting that the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus sequences detected were due to endogenous retroviral sequences known to be present in human DNA [26] .",

No unidentified BCs were found after in-depth mass spectrometry analysis. It should be noted that the SRV-1-related sequences found in the human cell lines and monkey cell lines had closely related BCs, but were not identical. PLEX-ID analysis of the canine MDCK and Cf2Th cell lines identified RD114-like gammaretrovirus sequences. Additionally, \"undistinguishable\" gammaretrovirus sequences were found in both cell lines whose BC matched several known gammaretroviruses (Table 3 ). Since the identification of RD114-like sequences in the canine cell lines was unexpected, a follow-up strategy was developed to understand the origin of this viral hit (Section 2.3).",

Since the first round of PCR amplified a slightly longer fragment from the MDCK cells than the nested PCR, we used the 74 bp fragment instead of the 64 bp fragment for further analysis (Figure 2a) .

Since the PLEX-ID amplicon was identified as RD114 and the sequence shared strong sequence identity with several Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones, an alignment was done with RD114 complete retrovirus genome (Genbank ID AB705392.1) as the query and the identified Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones (A-L) as the subject entries (Figure 2b) . Although PLEX-ID identified viral sequences belonging to RD114, the blastn alignment revealed three small regions (region 1, 2, and 3) with high alignment scores (80-200 and >200) to RD114 gag and pol (Figure 2b) . Each of these BAC clones was located in different regions of chromosome 1 or in different chromosomes altogether.

Proviral motifs were found in at least one location within each BAC clone; the range spanned by the provirus is listed in column 5 of Table 4 . In some cases, two proviral sequence chains (seq) were detected within a single BAC clone. For example, clones xx-73E6, and xx-219I19 each harbored two potential proviral regions; one provirus sequence chain shared similarity with RD114 (e.g., CfERV A and D) and the other sequence chain did not (e.g., CfERV M and N). It is likely proviruses that did not have homology to RD114 were related to other retroviruses [37] .",

Some proviruses like those found within clone xx-73E6 and xx-35E2 appear to possess many motifs, but only a fraction of the motif is present. Thus, these ERVs are likely inactive as a result of genetic duplications, insertions, deletions, and/or frameshifts that have occurred during host duplication over millions of years. These variations are clearly depicted in the alignment shown in Figure 2b , where different degrees of RD114 similarity are found in certain regions within each BAC clone.",

In addition, analogous pol regions of human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and ALV were used as distant delatretrovirus and alpharetrovirus homologs, respectively. We aligned the nucleotide sequences using both ClustalW and MUSCLE alignment options in MEGA 5.1 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis program) [36] to ensure the results were robust and not dependent on the type of alignment used. The phylogeny was constructed using a maximum-likelihood analysis based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (Figure 3 ) [34] . Bootstrapping (1000 replicates) was used to support the confidence at each node [35] . The results suggest that these ERVs diverged from a gammaretrovirus, perhaps RD114, but have undergone significant genetic change as demonstrated by the divergence within this set of sequences (Figure 3a) .

The infectious titer for XMRV was 10 4.5 TCID 50 per mL [39] and for SFV-1 was 10 5.5 TCID 50 per mL. For both viruses, 10-fold serial dilutions (range 10 0 -10 \u22127 ) were made from the original virus stock and the number of particles per \u00b5L was determined based upon RT activity using a modified STF-PERT assay (designated as two-step fluorescent-PERT; TSF-PERT). The number of particles in the original stock was determined as the average of the calculated particles at each dilution based upon a standard curve using HIV-1 RT enzyme (Worthington Biochemical Corporation Lakewood, NJ, USA, cat. No. LS05006; lot No. X1H2839), which was determined to have 262 pU of RT activity per particle [40] . The STF-PERT one-step assay [40] was modified into a two-step assay that no longer requires the use of AmpliWax \u00ae PCR Gem 50, a product that has been discontinued. In addition, the TSF-PERT assay was designed as a partially automated process compatible with the Eppendorf epMotion 5070 robot (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA, cat. No. 960000111). The RT master mix, standards, and samples were manually added to the 96-well plate as previously described [40] and the RT reaction was carried out using an Eppendorf MasterCycler ProS (Eppendorf, cat. No. 950030020). Once complete, the RT plate was placed on a 96-well cold Thermoblock (Eppendorf, cat. No. 960002083) and the PCR master mix was placed on a TMX 24 \u00d7 SafeLock Thermorack (Eppendorf, cat. No. 960002070). The Eppendorf epMotion 5070 robot dispensed 25 \u00b5L of the PCR master mix into each well. Finally, the plate was sealed and processed for Taqman qPCR. The results indicated that XMRV had 3.12 \u00d7 10 5 particles per \u00b5L and SFV-1 had 4.02 \u00d7 10 5 particles per \u00b5L .",

Nucleotide sequences were generated on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and sequence analysis was done using Vector NTI (Invitrogen).

However, SFV-1 could not be detected by the PLEX-ID due to the absence of relevant primers. LLMDA was a log more sensitive for detection of both XMRV and SFV-1 as compared to PLEX-ID and RT-PCR, but LLMDA could not detect these viruses in a background of 10 4 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. Selected samples of the XMRV (RNA dilutions 10 \u22126 -10 \u22127 ) and SFV-1 RNA panels (RNA dilutions 10 \u22125 -10 \u22126 ) were also tested with the ViroChip. In the absence of Sf9 total nucleic acids, the XMRV 10 \u22126 RNA dilution sample was detected by the ViroChip, whereas, the SFV-1 RNA dilution 10 \u22125 was not detected. In addition to the LOD studies, we used the new virus detection methods to analyze some vaccine-related cell substrates for the potential presence of novel viruses. Total nucleic acids were used for the detection of both DNA and RNA viruses. Analysis of cell lines by PLEX-ID and virus microarrays indicated the presence of various retrovirus-related sequences. However, the origin of these sequences could be attributed to the presence of cellular DNA containing endogenous retroviral sequences or viral transcripts that may be expressed constitutively from some endogenous retroviral DNAs (proviruses) [43] . However, this situation is applicable to all nucleic acid-based assays that can detect retroviruses. To assess the origin and nature of the retroviral sequences a follow up strategy using PCR, sequencing, and bioinformatics was developed. The analysis revealed that the unexpected RD114 sequences detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines were associated with defective endogenous gammaretroviruses. Similarly, blast analysis and amplicon base count comparisons also revealed that endogenous retrovirus sequences were responsible for positive hits within the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus families detected in human cell lines.",

These results emphasize the need to use a combination strategy for virus detection in evaluating the safety of biologicals or screening patient samples. It was noted that some expected virus sequences that were known to be present as fragments in some cells lines were not detected by any of the methods: e.g., adenovirus in HEK293 cells and 293T/17 cells, and HPV in HeLa cells. This may be due to the absence of primers for the viral specific regions in the assays. These results also indicate the need for further updates of the PLEX-ID panels and virus arrays to enhance detection of known and novel viruses.",
