They are known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses, manifesting in almost negligible expression of type-I interferons (IFN-I). This evasion strategy suggests an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent RNA-based sensing of infection in vertebrate hosts. Here we show that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) activity is key to prevent early induction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) host cell responses. Replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is greatly attenuated in vivo and severely restricted in primary cells even during the early phase of the infection. In macrophages we found immediate induction of IFN-I expression and RNase L-mediated breakdown of ribosomal RNA. Accordingly, EndoU-deficient viruses can retain replication only in cells that are deficient in IFN-I expression or sensing, and in cells lacking both RNase L and PKR. Collectively our results demonstrate that the coronavirus EndoU efficiently prevents simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors, such as Mda5, OAS and PKR.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are long known to be particularly successful in evading host innate immune responses. This manifests in barely detectable interferon responses during the first hours of infection and greatly facilitates establishment of robust virus replication. This phenotype of early innate immune evasion is common to all coronaviruses and can have detrimental consequences particular for infections with highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We therefore hypothesized that there must be an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent sensing of coronavirus infection by infected host cells. Our study now describes this function, namely the highly conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease activity. We found that coronaviruses that lack this enzymatic activity are readily visible to infected host cells that can now mount a swift and potent host response restricting virus replication within hours. Our study provides a new paradigm of a first layer of RNA virus innate immune evasion during the early phase of infection, that takes place at the site of RNA synthesis, and is based on removal of dsRNA that would otherwise trigger the simultaneous activation of cytoplasmic host cell sensors.

They rely on the ability to differentiate between immunological \"self\" and \"non-self\" in order to swiftly activate diverse antiviral effector mechanisms. Conceptually, sensing of virus infection is mainly mediated through recognition of viral nucleic acids, which are considered to comprise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by specialized host cell pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) [1] . Double-stranded (ds) RNA, an obligate replication intermediate of positivestranded RNA viruses that is accumulating during replication, is known as an important PAMP within the cytoplasm of infected cells. Host cell responses to dsRNA are versatile and include the expression of IFN-I by activating RIG-I like helicases (RLRs), such as Rig-I and Mda5, the inhibition of host cell translation by activating PKR, and the degradation of viral and host cell-derived RNA by activating the OAS/RNase L pathway [2] .",

They are well known to evade innate immune activation, particularly during the early phase of the infection [3] [4] [5] [6] . Coronavirus innate immune evasion is multifaceted and involves ribose-2'-O methylation of viral RNA, as well as compartmentalised RNA synthesis at virus-induced membrane structures comprised of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles [7] [8] [9] . The importance of functions encoded by the CoV replicase gene is further exemplified by non-structural protein (nsp) 1 that suppresses host gene expression by mediating host mRNA degradation [10, 11] , and nsp3 that contains a papain-like proteinase with deubiquitination activity interfering with IFN-I host cell responses [12, 13] . In addition, a number of accessory gene functions, although less conserved, have been described to target downstream events of innate immune activation, such as a phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity encoded by some coronavirus strains, which degrades 2',5'-oligoadenylate messenger molecules essential for RNase L activation [14, 15] .",

The EndoU domain is harboured in non-structural protein (nsp) 15 that is considered as an integral component of the coronaviral replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) [16] [17] [18] [19] . By using immunofluorescence microscopy analyses in HCoV-229E-infected cells with a HCoV-229E-nsp15-specific monoclonal antibody the characteristic perinuclear staining pattern known from various other CoV nsps was reported [19] . For MHV-A59, a similar study reports MHV-nsp15-specific perinuclear puncta that were detected using an MHV-nsp15-specific rabbit antiserum that partially overlapped with MHV nucleocapsid staining in MHV-A59-infected cells [20, 21] . Moreover, MHV nsp15 was shown to co-localize with viral RNA and to fractionate in similar fractions as other nsps following MHV infection [21, 22] . Notably, upon ectopic expression of a fusion protein comprised of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and MHV-nsp15, a pattern of cytoplasmic speckles, distinct from the characteristic pattern of the CoV replicase complex was observed, suggesting that the localization of ectopically expressed nsp15 or GFP-nsp15 fusion proteins may differ from the localization of nsp15 that is expressed in the context of the CoV polyprotein 1ab [20] . The CoV EndoU has uridylate-specific endonucleolytic activity on single-stranded and dsRNA [17] and is related to (i) cellular enzymes prototyped by XendoU [16, 23] and (ii) viral homologs conserved in all nidoviruses known to infect vertebrate hosts including fish, birds and mammals, suggesting an important role for this enzyme in an ancient cellular pathway. Over the past years, a wealth of structural and biochemical information has been obtained for EndoU. However, the precise role of this virus-encoded nucleolytic activity in coronavirus/nidovirus replication remains enigmatic [17, 18, [24] [25] [26] . Surprisingly, although EndoU is coexpressed with other key replicative proteins as part of the viral replicase polyprotein, its enzymatic activity is not essential for viral RNA synthesis in most cell culture systems [26] . In this work we illustrate a pronounced impact of the coronavirus EndoU activity on innate immune evasion. Specifically, we show that genetically engineered mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respectively, that encode an EndoU active-site substitution known to abolish nucleolytic activity, were severely attenuated and elicited an immediate and simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors.",

Replication of MHV H277A was reduced in L929 cells, but peak titers almost reached those of wild-type MHV-A59, confirming that the coronavirus EndoU activity is dispensable for virus replication in vitro ( Fig 1B) [25, 26] . In sharp contrast, compared to wild-type MHV-A59, the EndoU-deficient MHV H277A was severely attenuated in vivo (Fig 1C) . MHV H277A replication was not detectable in spleen and liver of C57BL/6 mice at two days post intraperitoneal infection with 500 plaque-forming units (pfu), demonstrating that the EndoU activity is required for efficient replication and spread in vivo. Notably, replication and spread of MHV H277A was partly restored in mice deficient for the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR), with viral titers of MHV H277A in the spleen and liver of IFNAR-deficient mice that did not reach those of MHV-A59. Interestingly, concerning the role of Mda5 and TLR7, which are known as main cytoplasmic and endosomal PRRs for coronaviral RNA, respectively, MHV H277A replication was not restored in Mda5-deficient, TLR7-deficient, or Mda5-and TLR7-deficient mice. This phenotype clearly differs from that described for coronaviruses that lack ribose-2'-O methyl-transferase (OMT) activity [9] . Thus, in experiments reported previously, we found that replication of OMT-deficient MHV (MHV D130A ) is restored in mice that are deficient for Mda5 and TLR7, suggesting that lack of ribose-2'-O methylation is tolerated if these two RNA sensors are absent. The lack of any detectable replication of the EndoU-deficient MHV H277A in Mda5-and TLR7-deficient mice therefore indicates that Mda5-and TLR7-mediated IFN-I expression may not exclusively restrict MHV H277A replication and that other mechanisms contribute to the observed attenuation of MHV H277A replication.",

Moreover, replication of MHV H277A was even more severely reduced in bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, and accompanied by early induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig 2B and  2C) . Notably, levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA were only transiently (6 to 12 h.p.i.) elevated in MHV H277A compared to MHV-A59 infected macrophages, and declined along with viral titers and viral RNA during the late phase of infection.

Mda5 has been described as the main RNA sensor of coronavirus infection in murine macrophages [29] . Compared to wild-type macrophages, IFN-\u03b2 expression was reduced in Mda5-deficient macrophages following MHV H277A infection, as shown by qRT-PCR and IFN-\u03b2 ELISA (Fig 3A and 3D ). Surprisingly, and again in contrast to the phenotype of the OMT-deficient MHV D130A [9] , MHV H277A replication was not restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages ( Fig 3A) . Similarly, although IFN-\u03b2 expression was likewise reduced in MAVS-deficient macrophages, MHV H277A replication was not restored in MAVS-deficient macrophages (Fig 3B and 3D ). Even in IRF3/ IRF5/IRF7 (IRF3/5/7 -/-) triple-knockout macrophages, that display an almost negligible induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression, MHV H277A replication was not fully restored (Fig 3C and 3D ). IFN-\u03b2 protein assessed by IFN-\u03b2 ELISA was below detection in all three macrophage genotypes (Mda5 -/-, MAVS -/-, IRF3/5/7 -/-; Fig 3D) . These results indicate that MHV H277A replication is either highly sensitive to already marginal amounts of IFN-I, or that other antiviral host cell responses may contribute to the attenuation of MHV H277A .",

Therefore, we infected murine L929 cells and human MRC5 lung fibroblasts with MHV H277A and HCoV-229E H250A , respectively, and applied different dosages of IFN-I for 4 hours prior to infection. Compared to wild type MHV and HCoV-229E, respectively, both EndoU-deficient viruses indeed displayed a pronounced sensitivity to IFN-I pre-treatment ( Fig 4C) . Remarkably, MHV H277A displayed a sensitivity to IFN-I treatment that is comparable to that of the highly IFN-I sensitive OMT-deficient mutant MHV D130A (S1 Fig). However, compared to the OMT-deficient mutant MHV D130A the phenotype of the EndoU-deficient MHV H277A differs mainly in the lack of restoration of replication under conditions with strongly reduced IFN-I expression (e.g. in Mda5 -/macrophages; Fig 3A) , suggesting that other, most likely IFN-I inducible, antiviral effector mechanisms account for restriction of MHV H277A replication. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the coronavirus EndoU activity plays a pivotal role in innate immune evasion in the context of the IFN-I system. EndoU-deficient coronaviruses induce activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway As noted above, coronavirus EndoU-deficiency results in a pronounced sensitivity to IFN-I treatment that is comparable to that of the highly IFN-I sensitive OMT-deficient mutant . Virus replication was measured at 24 h.p.i. by plaque assay (MHV) and at 48 h.p.i. by qRT-PCR (HCoV-229E), respectively. Data represent three independent experiments, each performed in two to three replicas. Data are displayed as differences to untreated controls and statistical comparisons between wild type and EndoU-deficient viruses were performed for each concentration. Mean and SEM are displayed.

However, replication of MHV H277A was not restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages. This observation prompted us to consider that replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses may activate additional dsRNA-triggered antiviral pathways. We therefore assessed the integrity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a marker for the activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway [31] , during MHV H277A infection in primary murine macrophages. Indeed, the breakdown of rRNA in MHV H277A infected wild-type macrophages was readily detectable as early as 6-12 h. p.i., thus coinciding with the induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression during the early phase of the infection (compare Figs 5A and 2C). This finding is highly surprising since MHV-A59 encodes a PDE activity that has been shown to degrade 2',5'-oligoadenylate messenger molecules essential for RNase L activation [14] . However, the PDE activity was apparently not sufficient to prevent RNase L activation in macrophages that had been infected with EndoU-deficient MHV H277A . To exclude that the lack of EndoU activity may directly impact on viral RNA synthesis and lead to reduced levels of subgenomic mRNAs, we assessed the level of genomic and subgenomic mRNA2 (encoding the PDE activity) by qRT-PCR. As shown in S2 Fig, genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA2 were equally reduced in MHV H277A infected wild-type macrophages, suggesting that the lack of EndoU activity does not result in selective reduction of subgenomic mRNAs. Importantly, while breakdown of rRNA was also readily detectable in Mda5-and MAVS-deficient macrophages, rRNA remained intact in RNase L-deficient macrophages, demonstrating that infection of EndoU-deficient MHV H277A indeed results in the activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway and subsequent degradation of rRNA (Fig 5A; S2 Fig) .",

Likewise, we did not observe breakdown of rRNA in L929 cells (Fig 5B) . We therefore assessed the levels of OAS 1a, 2, and 3 expression in L929 with or without IFN-I treatment (12.5 U). As expected, expression of IFN-\u03b2 was elevated in MHV H277A -, but not in MHV-A59-infected L929 cells, irrespectively of IFN-I pre-treatment (S4 Fig). Importantly however, expression of OAS 1a, 2 and 3 in L929 cells was significantly elevated following IFN-I treatment (S4 Fig), and accordingly, rRNA breakdown was readily detectable in IFN-I treated L929 cells that had been infected with MHV H277A (Fig 5B) .

This strongly suggests that yet another antiviral pathway, in addition to OAS/RNase L, is activated during MHV H277A infection. One obvious candidate is PKR, a kinase that can be directly activated by dsRNA to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), resulting in translation inhibition of cellular and viral mRNAs. Indeed, as shown in Fig 6B (left panel) , we readily detected phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 at 9 h.p.i.. In addition, we assessed the extent of translational inhibition at 9 h.p.i. by using puromycin and subsequent FACS analysis. As shown in Fig  6B, wild-type MHV-A59 infected cells showed active translation comparable to mock infected macrophages, while translational inhibition was observed in MHV H277A -infected macrophages. Finally, we assessed replication of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A in PKR-deficient macrophages, and as shown in Fig 6C, PKR-deficiency alone was also not sufficient for the restoration of MHV H277A replication. Importantly, however, we observed elevated replication of MHV H277A in primary macrophages that are deficient for both, PKR and RNase L that almost reached that of MHV-A59 ( Fig 6D) [34] . In order to more precisely analyse the degree of restoration of MHV H277A replication in IFNAR-and in RNase L/PKR-deficient macrophages, we performed a statistical analysis and compared the differences of calculated MHV-A59 and MHV H277A peak titers between C57BL/6 and IFNAR -/-(p = 0.008), between C57BL/6 and RNase L -/-/PKR -/-(p = 0.004) and between IFNAR -/and RNase L -/-/PKR -/-(p = 0.612) (Fig 6E) .

We obtained essentially the same result when we assessed dsRNA and nsp2/3 by FACS analysis following infection of IFNAR -/macrophages (Fig 7B and 7D) , suggesting that dsRNA is also increased in MHV H277A -infection under conditions of reduced host cell responses.

Second, we observe breakdown of ribosomal RNA indicative of activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway that temporally coincides with IFN-\u03b2 expression. Third, we show that efficient restriction of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is furthermore dependent on PKR since restoration of EndoU-deficient MHV H277A replication required the absence of both, PKR and RNase L. Our data suggest that direct restriction of replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is mediated by RNase L-mediated RNA degradation and inhibition of host cell translation through activation of PKR. In contrast, the effect of IFN-I appears to be indirect through the induction of ISG expression, that includes OAS/RNase L and PKR. Whether other ISGs may contribute to the restriction of EndoU-deficient coronavirus replication remains to be determined. Finally, we show that MHV H277A replication is associated with increased dsRNA levels during the early phase of the infection, providing a likely PAMP for the observed simultaneous activation of multiple cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensors in cells infected with EndoU-deficient coronaviruses.",

All three types of sensors, MDA5, OAS1-3, and PKR, are known to recognize dsRNA, suggesting that the PAMP (s) relevant for their activation during infection is/are of viral origin. Notably, RNase L correspond to Fig 4A) and RNase L -/-/PKR -/-(data correspond to Fig 6C) macrophages are displayed. Statistical analysis was performed to compare differences of calculated MHV-A59 and MHV H277A peak titers between C57BL/6 and IFNAR -/-(**, p = 0.008), between C57BL/6 and RNase L -/-/PKR -/-(**, p = 0.004) and between IFNAR -/and RNase L -/-/PKR -/-(p = 0.612; ns) macrophages following MHV-A59 and MHV H277A infection. Viral endonuclease and innate immunity activation can be triggered by different OAS proteins and may depend on particular cell types and virus infections [35] . For example overexpression of OAS 3 was shown to provide RNase L-dependent activity against dengue virus and chikungunya virus infection [36, 37] , while OAS 1 and OAS 3 have been implicated in antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus [38] . It recently has been shown that among the human OAS proteins 1, 2, and 3, OAS 3 seems to be mainly responsible for mediating RNase L activation following either polyI:C transfection or virus infection, suggesting a superior role of human OAS 3 over OAS 1 and OAS 2 in restricting virus replication [33] . Interestingly, structural and biochemical studies revealed that OAS 3 is selective for binding of long dsRNA (>50 bp) by involvement of an RNA-binding, but noncatalytic domain, and that OAS 3 is weakly or not activated by short dsRNA or single-stranded RNA, respectively [39] . Likewise, PKR preferentially dimerizes upon binding to dsRNA of similar length (>60 bp) [40, 41] and Mda5 is actually most efficiently activated by even longer dsRNA (>2 kbp) [42] and higher-order structured RNA containing single-stranded and dsRNA [43] . It is thus tempting to propose that viral dsRNA represents the natural substrate of the coronavirus EndoU. However, it remains to be determined which kind of viral dsRNA is cleaved by the EndoU or triggers Mda5, OAS, and PKR activation. Compared to MHV wildtype infection we observed a slight but reproducible increase of dsRNA in MHV H277A -infected macrophages by FACS analysis during the early phase of the infection (4-6 h.p.i.) that became more prominent at 9-12 h.p.i., suggesting that the majority of dsRNA is not cleaved by EndoU. This likely includes dsRNA being shielded within double-membrane vesicles and replication intermediates actively involved in viral RNA synthesis that are likely protected by the RTC and the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore speculate that coronaviruses may have evolved a viral RNA quality control mechanism to evade dsRNAs sensing, and that EndoU substrates may comprise dsRNA intermediates within stalled RTCs engaged in genome replication or transcription that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis.",

However, the recent discovery of insect nidoviruses (family Mesoniviridae) [44, 45] and re-analysis of the ronivirus genome (family Roniviridae; infecting crustaceans) revealed that these two nidovirus families do not encode an EndoU domain [44] . In the light of our results it is tempting to speculate that the EndoU domain has evolved in vertebrate nidoviruses (Corona-and Arteriviridae) to counteract vertebrate-specific innate immune sensing of viral RNA in the context of the type-I interferon system, while the absence of the EndoU domain in roni-and mesoniviruses is indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms of RNA virus innate immune sensing and antiviral effector pathways in invertebrates (e.g. crustaceans and insects) [1] .",

            "text": "MHV as a natural mouse pathogen has been instrumental to understand the delicate balance between host IFN-I responses to infection and counteracting mechanisms of coronavirus innate immune evasion. While MHV evades innate immune sensing in most target cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) remain as major IFN-I producer cells during early coronavirus replication to ensure protection of MHV target cells and control of potentially lethal coronavirus infections [46, 47] . While pDCs sense coronaviral RNA within endosomes through TLR7, our data demonstrate that the coronaviral EndoU delays Mda5-mediated cytoplasmic sensing in macrophages and likely other cell types. This enables coronaviruses to establish robust replication and spread at the entry port of infection. However, in the case of highly pathogenic strains or newly emerging zoonotic coronaviruses, delayed IFN-I responses can have detrimental consequences as recently demonstrated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection [3] . Early and rapid SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract combined with a delayed IFN-I response can result in dysregulated innate immune responses and inflammatory cytokine-driven extensive lung damage. Therefore, antiviral intervention aiming at inhibiting the coronavirus EndoU activity may be a promising approach to restore efficient sensing of coronaviral RNA and thereby activating IFN-I expression as well as antiviral effector pathways such as PKR and OAS/RNase L.",

            "text": "There is a growing number of virus-encoded ribonucleases that have been reported to execute diverse steps in the context of cellular mRNA quality control and mRNA decay [48, 49] . For example, herpesvirus-encoded endonucleases are known to broadly target cellular and also viral mRNAs that are subsequently further processed by cellular exonucleases, such as Xrn1, in order to broadly restrict host cell gene expression [50] . While this strategy indirectly impacts host cell innate immune responses, a more specific interaction of RNA decay and host cell dsRNA responses has recently been described for vaccinia virus decapping enzymes D9 and D10 [51, 52] . They remove 5'-cap structures of partially overlapping vaccinia virus mRNAs that arise during the late phase of infection in order to preclude any accumulation of viral dsRNA and subsequent activation of dsRNA sensors such as PKR and OAS. Notably, also in this case Xrn1 is required to further process the de-capped mRNAs. Our data show that early during coronavirus infection the EndoU activity conceptually fulfils the same task, namely the removal of dsRNA that would otherwise trigger host cell dsRNA responses, such as IFN-\u03b2 expression and activation of PKR and OAS/RNase L. It will be interesting to address whether Xrn1 is involved in further degrading the coronavirus EndoU cleavage products or if this function could be fulfilled by the coronavirus-encoded exonuclease (ExoN) activity residing in nsp14. Interestingly, like the EndoU, the coronavirus ExoN is an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, and ExoN has been demonstrated to provide an RNA proofreading function that permits coronaviruses to stably maintain their extraordinary large RNA genome [53] [54] [55] . A functional link between the two coronaviral ribonucleases, ExoN and EndoU, would suggest an unprecedented concept of viral RNA quality/decay control that goes beyond RNA proofreading and includes the removal of dsRNA-based PAMPs at the site of RNA synthesis to efficiently evade innate and intrinsic antiviral host cell responses.",

The FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) Mix (Roche) was used for measuring mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2, GAPDH and Tbp (S1 Table) . Induction of IFN-\u03b2 was normalized to levels of the household genes GAPDH and Tbp (geometric mean) and expressed as \u0394\u0394C T over mock (\u0394C T values calculated as C T reference-C T target) [62] . Expression of OAS1a, OAS2, OAS3 and RNase L mRNA in mock infected macrophages and L929 cells was normalized to levels of GAPDH [63] (S1 Table) . Expression levels were displayed as \u0394C T values (C T reference-C T target). Copy number of cell-associated viral RNA isolated from MHV infected macrophages was determined using the RT TaqMan PCR system (TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2x), No AmpErase UNG, Applied Biosystems) with primers and probe specific to the MHV genome fragment encoding the nucleocapsid (S1 Table) . Copy numbers were determined by using a standard curve, consisting of an in vitro transcribed RNA of known copy number, obtained from a plasmid comprising the MHV-nucleoprotein sequence.",

The coefficients A, M and P were determined individually for the groups to be compared (MHV-A59 and MHV H277A ), as symbolized by the index G. The model was chosen on pragmatic grounds because it was able to describe the time courses of all data very well and the coefficients represent biologically relevant aspects of the kinetics that can be addressed directly by statistical tests. The analyses were performed in R, version 3.2.3 [66] with the function nls [67] using the algorithm \"Port\" restricting the coefficients to positive values. P-values and confidence intervals were determined by parametric bootstrapping, resampling the residuals from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance estimated from the variance of residuals of the fitted model. Confidence bands were generated by connecting the point-wise 95% confidence intervals of the predictions. The significance of the difference between treatments in differences between maxima of the groups (i.e., the Group-Treatment interaction) was determined by bootstapping the difference-in-difference. The assumption of normally distributed residuals was checked and confirmed with normal-quantile quantile plots. All other data were analysed using R v.
