Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.",

Due to the virus's high evolutionary rate, significant resources must be spent to update vaccines each year in order to match the dominant epitope of the season. Even with annual strain selection, major antigenic reassortment can obviate otherwise promising vaccine candidates, as occurred with the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like H3N2 strain in 2003 [4, 5] . To prevent such vaccine failures, a solid understanding of the global spread of influenza must inform the design process. If reservoirs for new viral strains can be identified, surveillance in these areas can better optimize prediction of seasonal variants in seeded regions.",

Important motivating factors for such analysis include increased aerosol transmission in cold and dry conditions, as well as increased indoor crowding and decreased host immunity in cold and wet conditions [6, 7] . In the temperate zones, influenza exhibits distinct seasonality with flu-related cases spiking in the winter. However, several papers have confirmed the presence of viral diversity even between these epidemic peaks [8, 9, 10] , suggesting two possible scenarios during the inter-epidemic period: either viral infections locally persist at a low level only to reemerge as the dominant strains of the epidemic season, or an outside source introduces new genetic diversity into temperate populations each year. Although a degree of local persistence may occur, phylogenetic analysis supports the latter scenario, with few direct links between strains of the same region but successive seasons [8, 9, 10] .",

At first blush, northern-southern temperate oscillations seem credible. Each year, northern and southern temperate climates have alternating seasonal influenza epidemics, lasting from November to April, and May to September respectively [11] . A possible mechanism of viral spread could involve transmission from the seasonal peak of one temperate zone into the season ebb of the other. On the other hand, specific epidemiological characteristics suggest a tropical origin for influenza. For example, although both climates share a similar yearly burden of mortality from influenza, the tropics do not possess the same consistent seasonal peaks during the winter months [9, 12, 13] . With a constant, low-level circulation of viruses year-round, the tropics represent an ideal epicenter for the extended transmission of new viruses to the rest of the world [14, 15, 16] .",

Most papers focus on H3N2 as a single entity, when in reality, it co-circulates with several other subtypes, the most important of which is seasonal H1N1 [11] . Although they possess different surface antigens, H3N2 and H1N1 share enough genetic similarity to display cross-immunity. As a result, seasonal H1N1 may demonstrate transmission patterns distinct from H3N2's [18, 19] . Such codependence between different subtypes is exemplified by the pandemic years of 1957 and 1968, when H2N2 replaced preexisting H1N1 and H3N2 replaced preexisting H2N2, respectively [20, 21] . Similarly, the antigenically different pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009 has largely overtaken previously circulating H1N1 and H3N2 [22] . During the years our dataset took place, evidence that H3N2 and H1N1 rarely co-dominate in a season further supports the idea of codependent dynamics [7] .",

The first involves clustering isolates of high sequence similarity by region and season. Since we would expect highly similar sequences from the same time and location to be related, we considered seeding events between clusters to be of greater significance. Consideration of clusters rather than individual sequences nullifies the overrepresentation of a high number of isolates from a single region and season ( Figure 1 ). As a second strategy for eliminating bias, we determined statistical significance of inter-cluster seeding events by modeling transmission as a binomial distribution with prior probabilities based on the proportion of sequences isolated before a given time point. To illustrate our methodology, Figure 2 depicts the 2003-2004 flu season, which was marked by failure to predict the dominant, tropically-derived Fujian/411/2002-like H3N2 strain. We identified a strong seeding pattern from the tropics to all three climate zones, supporting the effectiveness of our methodology.",

The virus's rapid rate of evolution makes the selection of representative strains for vaccine composition a difficult process. From a global health viewpoint, how to optimally implement a limited stockpile of vaccines is another fundamental question that remains unanswered. An understanding of how influenza spreads around the world would greatly aid the design and implementation process, but regional and seasonal bias in collected virus samples hampers epidemiologic analysis. Here, we show that it is possible to counter this data bias through probabilistic modeling and represent the global viral spread as a network of seeding events between different regions of the world. On a local scale, our technique can output the most likely origins of a virus circulating in a given location. On a global scale, we can pinpoint regions of the world that would maximally disrupt viral transmission with an increase in vaccine implementation. We demonstrate our method on seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 and foresee similar application to other seasonal viruses, including swine-origin H1N1, once more seasonal data is collected.",

In particular, our HA dataset for H1N1 contained no sequences from Hong Kong and only 1 (0.091%) China sequence, while NA contained 9 (0.69%) Hong Kong and 3 (0.23%) China sequences.

Importantly, clustering HA1 by climate and continent was corroborated by findings from the complete HA and NA sequences, lending credence to the validity of the dataset.

From the data, an inferred seeding hierarchy would begin with China at the epicenter of an E-SE Asian influenza subnetwork. Our analysis supports China as the most predictive seeder of many Asian countries, including Hong Kong. Both China and Hong Kong then serve as a launching pad for the dispersal of new seasonal variants to the rest of the world [14, 17] , in particular USA and an Oceanic subnetwork dominated by interchange between Australia and New Zealand. Viruses from USA, the largest seeder of the entire world, then spread to a number of South American, European, and African countries. Interestingly, Australia and Hong Kong are equally probable seeders of the USA ( Figure 3D ). Detailed transmission events are enumerated in Table S2 . An inset of the Asian subnetwork is depicted in Figure 4C , a demonstration of this study's high geographic resolution. After clustering, there were a total of 10 observed seeding events into the northern temperate zone: 1 from the north, 4 from the tropics, and 5 from the south. Up until that year, the skewed regional distribution of HA sequences included 541 (48.3%) northern temperate, 240 (21.4%) tropical, and 339 (30.2%) southern temperate isolates. Multiplying these percentages with the 10 observed seeding events yielded expected counts of 4.8, 2.1, and 3.0. Therefore, the number of seeding events from the north was less than expected, and from the tropics and the south, more than expected. Corresponding binomial p-values-0.986, 0.043, and 0.049, respectively-indicated that there were two statistically significant events, the most significant of which was transmission from the tropics into the northern temperate zone. Similar analysis for transmission into the tropics and the southern temperate showed that only the tropical zone was a significant seeder. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001005.g002",

Importantly, we can accurately detect internal events in temperate countries since their flu seasons are discrete. On the other hand, the specificity for internal events in the tropics is much lower due to unpronounced seasonal peaks. To minimize the number of local false positives, we demarcated seasons within the tropics on a per country basis. We found that for all climate zones except the tropics ( Figure S4A ) and all continents except Asia ( Figure S5A ), the number of internal seeding events paled in comparison to the proportion of external seeding events,. The more numerous internal events in the tropics and Asia indicate a high level of circulation between tropical countries and between Asian countries. This pattern is supported by the highly interconnected E-SE Asian subnetwork depicted in Figure 4C . The small proportion of internal events for countries supports the notion that local persistence often plays only a minor role in influenza transmission [8, 9, 10] (Figure 6A ).",

As an analogy, consider the influenza network as a system of connected train stations each representing a single region seeding influenza. In such systems, trains begin and end their routes at terminal stations. Similarly, influenza commuters begin their journeys at terminal sources and end at terminal sinks in each season. These start and end terminals can represent regions where new influenza variants respectively originate and ultimately spread to. To quantify the terminal characteristic, we calculated the outdegree minus the indegree of each node, which we term ''degree flow.'' Positive degree flow indicates terminal sources, while negative indicates terminal sinks. Countries were also ranked by calculating the proportion of nodes in a 1,000 randomized networks with a greater, or lesser, degree flow (Text S1). For analysis by climate zone, the tropics was identified as the only terminal source, suggesting that flu spreads from the tropical belt outward to both temperate zones ( Figure S4B ). As for continental clustering, Asia was the only terminal source, indicating that global circulation begins in Asia and ends in terminal sink continents, of which North America was the most prominent ( Figure S5B) . On a country level, Hong Kong and China were the greatest terminal sources, corroborating our observations ( Figure 3D) . Australia was also a conspicuous terminal source, especially within the Oceanic subnetwork where it seeded the greatest terminal sink, New Zealand. Several South American countries, including Chile and Argentina, figure as terminal sinks too, correlating with such countries as antigenically delayed [8] (Figure 6B ).",

Graph theory metrics-terminal and waypoint sinks and sources, as well as degree and betweenness centralities-pinpoint potential regions in which increased vaccinations could stem the transmission of influenza globally as well as locally. Increased analytical resolution could optimize vaccine design by choosing the dominant antigenic strain of a country's most predictive seeder. Vaccines could be catered to each country, rather than each hemisphere. At the very least, our analysis advises strain selection from the tropics, from which seasonal strains are dispersed each year.

Consequently, the conclusions of this paper may not necessarily apply to current dynamics of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1. However, the fact that H1N1 shares a tropic-centric movement pattern with H3N2 despite cross-reactivity suggests that these patterns may still persist even in the presence of the cross-reactive S-OIV. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that when more sequence data is deposited in NCBI, a similar methodology can be applied to predict global circulation of S-OIV as well.",

For each segment, only protein coding regions were considered. Furthermore, we only used sequences with full date (year, month and day) and location information to build hierarchies. Geographical coordinates of each isolate were obtained using geolocation information from Google Maps. Sequences were then aligned using the ClustalW v. 1.83 multiple sequence alignment package using default parameters for H3N2 and H1N1, respectively. For each segment, sequences were aligned and those that were poorly aligned compared to the rest of the dataset were removed until all sequences aligned with a Hamming distance no greater than 0.15. Given estimated mutation rates of 6.7610 23 nucleotide substitutions per site per year [12, 19] , Hamming distances over the 20-year span of our dataset are expected to be no more than 0.15 of the sequence length. Outlying sequences were most likely incorrectly sequenced and were discarded from analysis.",

First, we determined the most parsimonious evolutionary paths traversed by the flu virus. To this end, we sorted sequences from earliest to most recent viral isolates. Working backwards from newest to oldest, we calculated the sequence similarity of each virus to all earlier isolates regardless of geography. We defined a virus's most likely ancestor to be the sequence with minimum Hamming distance. From this data we built evolutionary paths for each virus. Related sequences were clustered (grouped) together by common geography and season to simplify the paths. For example, a chain of related viruses in the same region and season would be collapsed into a single umbrella node representing all of them. Our analysis was then based on looking at the transitions between clusters rather than individual viruses. We counted these ''seeding events,'' where the closest ancestor of a given cluster of sequences is from a different region or season [8] (Figure 1 ). When tallying seeding events, non-unique solutions were not considered where a given viral isolate possessed multiple closest ancestors from different geographical zones or seasons (Text S1, Figure S6 ).",

For each entry, there was a maximum number of 22 seeding seasons, the range in the date of isolation for all datasets. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001005.g003",

(A) Seasonal variants emerge from Asia and make their way to North America. A smaller connection from North America to South America is consistent with the finding that South American isolates are antigenically delayed[8]. (B) Clustering by country showed tropic-centric movement patterns. (C) H3N2 seeding events in the South-East Asian/Oceanic subnetwork showing China, Hong Kong, and Australia as major hubs. Arrows signify the direction of the seeding event. Each edge is color-coded according to weight: the number of seeding events represented.

One explanation is the lack of Hong Kong and China sequences in HA compared to NA. The difference between HA and NA counts may reflect the impact of including even a marginal number of Hong Kong and China sequences. If H1N1 sequences were more evenly distributed by region, one may anticipate seeding counts more aligned with those of H3N2.
