            "text": "Duck is a major waterfowl species in China, providing high-economic benefit with a population of up to 20-30 billion per year. Ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). The immune mechanisms against DTMUV invasion and infection remain poorly understood. In this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were infected with DTMUV and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. In total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. The key DEGs in immune system included those of the cytokines (IFN \u03b12, IL-6, IL-8L, IL-12B, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (IRF7, NF-\u03baB, STAT1, TMEM173, and TNFAIP3), pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and antigen-presenting proteins (CD44 and CD70). This suggests DTMUV infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. However, these cytokines could not protect DEFs against viral attack. Our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding DTMUV-infected DEFs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against DTMUV infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of DTMUV infection.",

DTMUV, similar to other flaviviruses, is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with an approximately 11 kb genome. The virus belongs to the Ntaya antigenic group of the family Flavirviridae [2] . It infects ducks in addition to geese [3, 4] , chickens [5] , sparrows [6] , mice [7, 8] , and pigeons [9] . More importantly, a wide spectrum of mammalian cells exhibit cytopathic effects (CPEs) following Tembusu virus infection, such as A549, BHK21, Hela, Vero, and SH-SY5Y [10] , and also including HEK293 according to our recent study. These findings imply that the virus has expanded its host range and may pose a threat to mammals' health [11] .",

Once the virus invades host cells, the first line of cellular defense (i.e., host innate immune system) involves the activation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. Subsequently, interferon (IFN)-related signaling pathways are activated, resulting in the induction of IFN-stimulated genes, which can inhibit viral replication [12] .

As shown in Figure 6 , 95.7% (22/23) of DEGs were upregulated in Toll-like receptor pathways at 12 hpi compared with 81.3% (26/32) of DEGs at 24 hpi. In Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways, 100% (13/13) of DEGs were upregulated at 12 hpi compared with 92.3% (12/13) at 24 hpi. In Chemokine signaling pathways, 100% (19/19) of DEGs were upregulated at 12 hpi compared with 77.4% (24/31) at 24 hpi. In NOD-like receptor signaling pathways, 100% (9/9) of DEGs were upregulated at 12 hpi compared with 76.9% (10/13) at 24 hpi. Regarding DEGs involved in the Hematopoietic cell lineage, a higher percentage of DEGs were upregulated at 12 hpi than at 24 hpi (90.9% (10/11) vs. 59.9% (13/22) ). Cumulatively, these results indicated that stronger immune responses were induced by DTMUV infection at 12 hpi than at 24 hpi. Detailed information about the major immune-relevant enriched genes is shown in Table S4 . ",

For the chemokine signaling pathway, the top six DEGs were CCL19, CCR7, IL-8L, LOC101795038 (fractalkine-like), STAT1, and CCL20. For the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the top six DEGs were TNFAIP3, IL-8L, IL-6, NFKBIA, NFKB1, and BIRC2. For the hematopoietic cell lineage, the top five DEGs were CD7, LOC101800410 (T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1b-3-like), IL-6, ANPEP, and CD44. For the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, the top six DEGs were IRF7, IL-12B, IFN-\u03b12, transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173/STING), IL-8L, and IFIH1.

            "text": "In this study, some key PRRs in the above mentioned pathways were recognized by DTMUV, such as RIG-I, and MDA5, which triggered the host innate immune response. As previously reported, MDA5 and RIG-I can recognize long RNA fragments or dsRNAs (not triphosphorylated) and 5 -triphosphorylated or short RNA fragments, respectively [5, 34] . The two PRRs were also recognized by other flaviviruses, such as Dengue virus [35, 36] , Zika virus [34, 37] , Hepatitis virus [38] , Japanese encephalitis virus [35, 39] , West nile virus [40, 41] , and Avian tembusu virus [5] , indicating that DTMUV may trigger the same innate immune signaling pathway as the above flaviviruses. In this study, DTMUV was sensed by PRRs in DEFs, and various immune molecules were efficiently induced. The results were somewhat similar to those obtained in a previous study, which uncovered that IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 were upregulated in the spleens of DTMUV-infected ducks [33] . However, these cytokines could not inhibit DTMUV replication in DEFs. This may be the reason for the occurrence of \"cytokine storm\", which is a phenomenon of multiple inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and MCP-1, etc.) overproduced for resisting pathogens. The overexpressed cytokines can also cause great harm to the host when they resist pathogen invasion [33, 42] .",

NF-\u03baB is a vital transcription factor that regulates genes responsible for a variety of immune response [42] . STAT1, is one of the most important members of the STAT protein family, which plays important roles in regulating cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [45] . In addition, inactivation of NF-\u03baB or disruption of IRF7 could significantly reduce the productions of type I and type III IFN in response to avian Tembusu virus infection in 293T cells [5] . The results of the current study illustrated that the three above mentioned transcriptional factors were significantly upregulated in DEFs at 12 and 24 hpi after DTMUV infection. Meanwhile, these highly expressed transcriptional factors provide favorable conditions for the high production of ILs, IFNs, and chemotactic factors.",

The PCR assay was conducted using TransStrat Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) on a 7300 Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Bio systems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each 20-\u00b5L reaction mixture contained 0.5 \u00b5L of each primer, 1 \u00b5L of DNA template, 10 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7Trans Strat \u00ae Top Green qPCR Super Mix, and 8.0 \u00b5L of ddH 2 O. The PCR amplification program followed the following protocol: 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, followed by 42 cycles at 94 \u2022 C for 5 s, 60 \u2022 C for 31 s, and dissociation stage. Each sample had three biological replicates, and the duck glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene served as the endogenous reference gene. The relative expression levels of DEGs were transformed using the 2 \u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method. All data are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of five replicates. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to compare RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data using the SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA)",
