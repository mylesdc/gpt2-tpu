            "text": "Background: Dengue, caused by one of the four serologically distinct dengue viruses (DENV-1 to \u2212 4), is a mosquito-borne disease of serious global health significance. Reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tests, along with effective vaccines and vector-control strategies, are highly required to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality. Evaluation studies revealed that many commercially available NS1 antigen (Ag) tests have limited sensitivity to DENV-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes. These studies indicated the need for development of new NS1 Ag detection test with improved sensitivity to DENV-4. An NS1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) specific to DENV-4 may improve the detection of DENV-4 cases worldwide. In addition, a serotype-specific NS1 Ag test identifies both DENV and the infecting serotype. Methods: In this study, we used a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO*) cloning vector to express a SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein to develop NS1 DENV-4 specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These newly developed MAbs were then optimized for use in an anti-NS1 DENV-4 capture ELISA. The serotype specificity and sensitivity of this ELISA was evaluated using (i) supernatants from DENV (1-4)-infected Vero cell cultures, (ii) rNS1s from all the four DENV (1-4) and, (iii) rNS1s of related flaviviruses (yellow fever virus; YFV and West Nile virus; WNV). Results: From the evaluation studies of the newly developed MAbs, we identified three DENV-4 specific anti-NS1 MAbs: 3H7A9, 8A6F2 and 6D4B10. Two of these MAbs were optimal for use in a DENV-4 serotype-specific NS1 capture ELISA: MAb 8A6F2 as the capture antibody and 6D4B10 as a detection antibody. Conclusion: This ELISA was sensitive and specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV (1-3) serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses. Taken together these data indicated that our MAbs are useful reagents for the development of DENV-4 immunodiagnostic tests.",

            "text": "Dengue is a serious disease of public importance with increasing worldwide spread. It is caused by an infection with any one of the four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4). Current diagnosis of an acute DENV infection primarily relies on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a highly sophisticated test. To improve dengue case detection in dengue endemic countries, a highly sensitive, specific and simple rapid assay is needed to provide early support for patients and to accurately differentiate dengue from other acute febrile illnesses. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a unique diagnostic marker for early detection of DENV compared to serological tests (i.e., anti-DENV IgM) because it is detected in the serum of DENV-infected patients as early as one day post onset of symptoms (DPO) to 18 DPO at concentration up to 50 \u03bcg/ml and it is a confirmatory test [1] . Whereas anti-DENV IgM is not present until five days after illness onset, can cross react with other flaviviruses thus not considered a confirmatory test especially in regions where multiple flaviviruses co-circulate. NS1 is highly conserved glycoprotein and possesses both group-specific and serotype-specific epitopes hence it can discern DENV from other flaviviruses and has the potential to differentiate between DENV serotypes [2] .",

            "text": "Our rationale to develop a DENV4 ELISA was due to the limited sensitivity of NS1 tests for detection DENV-4 infections. Recent evaluation study using retrospective samples from South America showed lower sensitivity of seven commercially available NS1 Ag tests for DENV-4 compared to the other three serotypes [7] . Also, metaanalysis for DENV detection in Asia showed the lowest sensitivity of the commercial NS1 Ag tests was against DENV-4 detection [16] . Further, studies conducted in Brazil showed the lower sensitivity of Platelia NS1 Ag ELISA (BioRad) for DENV4 detection [13, 14] . Collectively, these data suggest the need for development of new NS1 Ag detection test that incorporates monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with higher sensitivity to In order to improve the performance of NS1 Ag detection tests with higher sensitivity to DENV-4, it is important to understand why the current NS1 Ag detection tests failed to detect DENV4 infections efficiently. Almost all the present commercial NS1 Ag detection tests are based on cross-reactive anti-NS1 MAbs to all four DENV serotypes due to common epitopes. Epitope mapping studies have identified epitopes LX1 (113-YSWKTWG-119) and LD2 that are common to all four DENV serotype [2, 17, 18] . Several studies showed the absence of significant amino acid sequence variation in the epitopes of serotype-crossreactive MAbs [2, 19, 20] . This is consistent with Aryati and colleagues observation that there was no link between NS1 gene (amino acid) sequence variation and the poor performance of Dengue Early (Panbio) for DENV-4 detection [6] . Factors other than NS1 gene (and/or amino acid) sequence variation may impact the bio-accessibility and/or binding of the conserved epitopes to MAbs depending on the serotype. For example, the bio-accessibility of the conserved epitopes may vary according to the serotype/genotype when the NS1 protein is folded and assembled to form the NS1 hexamer. Hence, this suggest the common linear epitopes targeted by MAbs could be partially accessible on the NS1 hexamer isoform of DENV-4. The crystal structure by Akey and colleagues identified 108 linear epitopes that were mapped to the hexamer form of the protein primarily to the wing domain, C-terminal tip of the Beta bladder and Beta roll which are the most exposed epitopes. This study also demonstrated that the Beta rolls are most likely unexposed epitopes and the spaghetti loop and glycosylation sites are exposed epitopes [21] . Future studies may be able to use the crystal structure predicted exposed epitopes to design novel NS1 immunogenic MAbs.",

In order to avoid cell lysis and thereby the release of proteolytic enzymes into the culture medium, DENV-infected Vero cells were monitored every day for cytopathic effect (CPE), and culture supernatants were harvested and filtered on day 3 or 4 post infection at5 0% CPE. The same procedure was followed for control antigen from mock-infected Vero cells. Culture medium was concentrated (3X) by using Amicon, Centricon-30 K (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and treated with SIG-MAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

A combination of three methods: western blot assay, iELISA and fixed cell ELISA were used to select hybridoma clones that could secrete MAbs reactive to DENV NS1. Three MAbs designated hereafter as 3H7A9, 6D4B10, and 8A6F2 had reactivity to DENV-4 rNS1 but not to SUMO* tag. Also, these three MAbs did not cross-react with any of rNS1s from the other three heterologous DENV serotypes and other related flaviviruses (yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV)). The remaining three (10H10B5, 10H8F7, 4B6C10) were found to be specific to SUMO* tag (Tables 1  and 2 , Figs. 3, 4 and 5) . This result was expected since the mice were immunized with SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein, and the relative size of SUMO* tag,~11.5 kDa. The light-chain and heavy-chain isotypes of all the six MAbs, including those which are DENV-4 serotypespecific were IgG2b and \u041a, respectively. Competition ELISA result (data not shown) in combination with result from sequencing the three complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) of MAbs (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) revealed that our three DENV-4 NS1 serotype-specific MAbs were distinct with different binding regions on the DENV-4 NS1.",

However, 3H7A9 had a relatively lower affinity (Fig. 4) and was not utilized for development of our NS1 capture assay. Thus only MAbs 6D4B10 and 8A6F2 were utilized for the development of a new NS1 capture ELISA. Based on the limit of detection (LOD) curves, shown in Fig. 6 , a matched pair 8A6F2/biotinylated 6D4B10 had the lowest LOD (32.5 ng/ml) while a matched pair 6D4B10/B-8A6F2 was not robust to capture and/or detect DENV-4 rNS1 even at a higher concentration (Fig. 6b) . Those matched MAbs pairs that did not perform well could be due to: (i) the denaturation/random orientation of 6D4B10 as a result of direct binding to the microtiter plate, (ii) biotin molecules might have bound on the antigen binding region of 8A6F2, or (iii) a combination of two [24, 25] . Nevertheless, result from a direct ELISA (data not shown), in which microtiter plate-wells were coated overnight with DENV-4 rNS1, and detection of bound antigen was made by biotinylated 8A6F2, suggest that the loss of antigen-antibody binding in an NS1 capture ELISA format based on match pair 6D4B10/ biotinylated 86FA2 was not linked to the biotinlyation. Determination of the best working concentration of capture and detection was done by checkerboard titration and the optimal concentrations for coating MAb, 8A6F2 and detection MAb, biotinylated 6D4B10 were found to be 10 \u03bcg/mL and 1:2000 dilution, respectively.",

Coli and standard baculovirus antigen expression because SUMO* tagged DENV-4 rNS1 was secreted as soluble molecule in culture medium and our previous studies with E.Coli protein expression did not yield any immunogenic MAbs. Furthermore, the purified SUMO* tagged DENV NS1 did not require complex multi-steps for solubilizing and refolding as required by E.Coli protein expression. We used SUMO* as an N-terminal tag to enhance the solubility, stability and correct folding of DENV-4 rNS1 [22, [28] [29] [30] . SUMO fusion technology has previously been used for successful expression of functional hexameric DENV-2 rNS1 in insect cell lines, and the rNS1 protein product was properly glycosylated as it exist in its native form [31] . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding a successful expression of soluble and stable DENV-4 NS1 with a correct folding using SUMO* fusion technology. We then demonstrated the utility of purified SUMO*-DENV rNS1 for generation of MAbs that could be applied for development of immunodiagnostic tests for dengue. Production of a properly-folded soluble NS1 protein appears to be crucial for the development of MAbs, which are reactive to epitopes on hexameric NS1. Isolation and purification of proteins expressed in E.Coli required solubilization in harsh detergents (e.g., SDS and urea) which denatured the target protein and required complex refolding process. DENV NS1 expressed in E. Coli often resulted in insoluble aggregates (i.e., inclusion bodies) [32] [33] [34] [35] . Expression of rNS1 in insect cell line such as Sf9 and Sf21 using a baculovirus expression system has been utilized [26, 27] but, in our experience (unpublished data), the expressed rNS1 protein also remained insoluble, and required solubilization and refolding.",

The results (data not shown) confirmed that all the three MAbs bind to distinct non-overlapping regions and can be used to develop sandwich immunodiagnostic assay. The distinctness of these three MAbs was further verified by sequencing the three complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) of MAbs. MAb 3H7A9 was DENV-4 serotypespecific but had weak affinity to DENV-4 hence was not used for assay development. Only MAbs 6D4B10 and 8A6F2 were chosen to develop an NS1 capture ELISA. In order to use biotin-streptavidin based capture ELISA format, different pairs of unbiotinylated and biotinylated MAbs were evaluated. Subsequently, a match pair of unbiotinylated 8A6F2 as a capture antibody and biotinylated (B)-6D4B10 as a detection antibody provided the most robust results compared to 6D4B10 as capture and B-8A6F2 as the detector. The reason for the poor performance of the later matched pair MAbs may be due to: (i) the denaturation/random orientation of 6D4B10 as a result of direct binding to the microtiter plate, (ii) biotin molecules binding to the antigen binding region of 8A6F2, or (iii) a combination of these two [24, 25] . Nevertheless, a direct ELISA (data not shown), in which microtiter plate-wells were coated with DENV-4 rNS1, and detected by B-8A6F2 showed reactivity of the biotinylated 8A6F2 to DENV-4 rNS1 protein, suggesting the loss of antigen-antibody binding in NS1 capture ELISA format (capture with 6D4B10 and detect with B-86FA2) was not due to the biotinlyation. This MAb pair may function efficiently if one avoids direct binding of this MAb to the microplate surface by using lower affinity capture MAb, 6D4B10 immobilization method or a linker. The newly developed DENV-4 NS1 specific capture ELISA therefore used 8A6F2 as the capture and B-6D4B10 as the detection antibody. The DENV-4 serotype-specificity was assessed using rNS1 of flaviviruses, including all four DENV serotypes and culture supernatants from Vero cell-infected with all four DENV serotypes. Because flaviviruses family of viruses may cross react in immunodiagnostic test due to their highly antigenic similarities, we included YFV and WNV to ensure DENV specificity. The results confirmed that these MAbs specifically bound to DENV-4 in the NS1 capture ELISA and not to other flaviviruses (WNV, YFV).",

            "text": "Another factor that could have contributed to the poor sensitivity of NS1 Ag detection tests for DENV-4 is the low level expression of NS1 in DENV-4-infected patients as compared to in dengue patients infected with the other three serotypes [5, 36] . An NS1 capture ELISA specific to DENV-4 could improve the detection of DENV-4 cases and a serotype-specific NS1 Ag test can identify dengue and the infecting DENV serotype [37] . NS1 ELISAs for each one of the four DENV serotypes have been previously described [38] [39] [40] however, none of them are commercially available and hence currently the only commonly used laboratory methods to determine DENV serotype is RT-PCR. There are two main advantages in identifying the DENV serotype: (i) risk factors for severe dengue have associated to more pathogenic DENV serotypes, and (ii) the sequence of infection of DENV serotype in primary and secondary infections is also believed to be a risk factor for severe disease. Taken together, there is a need for improvement of the current NS1 assay for detection of DENV-4 serotype. This could be done by developing multiplex lateral flow assay (LFA) that utilize broadly binding anti-DENV NS1 MAbs as well as our MAbs specific to DENV-4 NS1. However, this requires an investigation on the utility of our DENV-4 -specific MAbs for LFA.",

Based on our characterization results and competition ELISA, the NS1 capture ELISA for potential early detection DENV-4 infection was established using a combination of two highly sensitive MAbs: 8A6F2 as coating antibody, biotinylated 6D4B10 as detection antibody and an optimized protocol was developed. The assay was specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses. Our preliminary results indicated that our MAbs are useful reagents for development immunodiagnostic assays (e.g., ELISAs and LFA) that specifically detect DENV-4 infection. These DENV serotype specific MAbs have the potential to change the way we detect dengue by providing tests that are user friendly to resource poor regions to adopt them for diagnosing dengue. Given that the current commercial NS1 tests are less sensitivity to DENV-4, our paired MAbs could be useful for development of multiplex assay that detects all four serotypes simultaneously in regions where DENV-4 circulates. However, one major limitation of this study is that these MAbs were not tested using DENV-4 clinical specimens thus these MAbs require further validation. Furthermore a full validation testing should be conducted to better understand the limitations of these MAbs in flavivirus clinical specimens.",
