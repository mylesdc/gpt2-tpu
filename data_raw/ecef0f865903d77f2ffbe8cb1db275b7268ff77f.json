            "text": ": (A) Temperature dependence of yeast invertase-FPc conjugate (Inv-FPc) activity. At each temperature, a 1.8 uL mixture containing 1.8 \u03bcg Inv-FPc/FP/MBs and 250 mM sucrose was incubated for 3 min, followed by measurement of glucose yielded using a glucometer. (B) Time dependence of yeast invertase inactivation. After pre-heating at 55 o C for variable periods of time (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 30 min) in the absence of sucrose, 50 \u03bcg/mL yeast invertase (270 kDa) was mixed with 500 mM sucrose at a 1:1 volume ratio and further incubated at 55 o C, followed by a glucometer measurement every 5 min. (C) Time dependence of thermostable yeast invertase (TmINV) inactivation. Experiments were similar to those shown for Figure S1B , except that 10 \u03bcg/mL thermostable invertase (55 kDa) was used. This represents an equimolar concentration (mole/L) of invertase as in Figure S1B . For all experiments in Figures S1B and S1C, 25 mg/dl glucose was also manually spiked into the sucrose solution to guarantee there was a readable signal on the glucometer. Figure S2 . Detection of DNA mimic of the LAMP loop (1A-T) using the OSD-to-glucose transduction. 1A-T directly initiates a one-step strand displacement (OSD) reaction to release the Inv-FPc reporter sequence from the capture FP sequence conjugated to magnetic beads. After magnetic separation, the released Inv-FPc reporter sequence is then detected by the production of glucose by the conjugated invertase and readout via a glucometer. (A) Kinetic curves of glucose generation in presence of different concentrations of 1A-T and 1 \u03bcM non-specific sequence (Random sequence). (B) Concentration dependence of 1A-T using the 40 min glucometer signal collected from Figure S2A . For these assays a commercially available yeast invertase was used with 1 hour 25 o C OSD. Figure S3 . Agarose gel electrophoretic characterization of LAMP amplicons produced from target and non-target templates. N-1, N-2, P-1, P-2, P-3 represent LAMP reactions amplified from 2E2 copies, 2E4 copies, and 2E6 copies of MERS-CoV sORF1A DNA (=MERS), buffer control, and 7E5 copies of non-specific target control (RPOB), in presence of the MERS-CoV specific primer set, OSF1A.55. N-3 represents LAMP reaction amplified from 7E5 copies of non-specific target control (RPOB) in presence of a RPOB specific primer set. For each sample, LAMP reaction is carried out at 55 o C for 1.5 hour. Then a 5 \u00b5l aliquot of the each reaction mixed with 3 \u00b5l of 6 \u00d7 DNA loading dye is analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Figure S7 . Detection of synthetic ZEBOV DNA (ZEBOV-VP30) using LAMP-to-glucose transduction in synthetic sputum or human saliva. Glucometer responses to 1E2 copies (P-1), 1E3 copies (P-2) and 1E4 copies (P-3) of synthetic ZEBOV VP30 (= ZEBOV) or to a DNA buffer control (0 copies, N-1) in the presence of (A) 26% treated mucin synthetic sputum or (B) 20% treated human saliva. Reaction conditions were as in Figure 3 . The error bars represent standard deviations calculated from two parallel assays. The thermostable TmINV was used in these experiments.",

The PCR reactions were set up following the WHO recommended protocol. Each 25 \u03bcL reaction contained 0.4 \u03bcM reverse and forward primers, 0.2 \u03bcM Taqman probe, 1 \u03bcL of a SuperScript\u00ae III reverse transcriptase and Platinum\u00ae Taq DNA polymerase mixture (provided in the Invitrogen superScriptIII OneStep RT-PCR system), 0.2 mM dNTP mixtures, and different amounts of MERS-CoV RNA or synthetic RNA. The reaction conditions were as follows: 55 o C for 20s, 94 o C for 3s, followed by 50 cycles of 94 o C for 15s and annealing/extension at 58 o C for 30s.The synthetic RNAs with known copy numbers were to quantify the extracted MERS-CoV RNAs. The equivalence was approximately 25,000 copies of synthetic RNA equals 15 PFU MERS-CoV RNA.The sequences of the primers used were: Reverse primer: 5'-CCACTACTCCCATTTCGTCAG-3' Forward primer: 5'-CAGTATGTGTAGTGCGCATATATGCA-3' Taqman probe: 5'-FAM-TTGCAAATTGGCTTGCCCCCACT-TAMRA-3' Realization of high temperature OSD and one-tube LAMP-OSD transduction. The graph shows the signal amplitude (\u0394Glucose meter signal, positive signalnegative signal, left y-axis, rectangles) and signal-to-background ratio (positive signal / negative signal, right y-axis, dots) of the three sensing protocols. Positive signal is glucometer response to RNA extracted from 60 PFU MERS-CoV. Negative signal is glucometer response to buffer negative control.Protocol 1: 1.5 hour 55 o C RT-LAMP, 1 hour 25 o C OSD, and 23 min 55 o C glucose generation is carried out in a sequential pathway. Protocol 2: 1.5 hour 55 o C RT-LAMP, 1 hour 55 o C OSD, and 11 min 55 o C glucose generation is carried out in a sequential pathway. Protocol 3: RT-LAMP and OSD is carried out simultaneously (in one tube) at 55 o C for 1.5 hour, followed by 15 min 55 o C glucose generation. The thermostable TmINV was used in all these experiments.
