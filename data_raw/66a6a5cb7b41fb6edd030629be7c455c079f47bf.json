            "text": "Laboratory cats were infected with a serotype I cat-passaged field strain of FIP virus (FIPV) and peritoneal cells harvested 2-3 weeks later at onset of lymphopenia, fever and serositis. Comparison peritoneal cells were collected from four healthy laboratory cats by peritoneal lavage and macrophages predominated in both populations. Differential mRNA expression analysis identified 5621 genes as deregulated in peritoneal cells from FIPV infected versus normal cats; 956 genes showed > 2.0 Log 2 Fold Change (Log 2 FC) and 1589 genes showed < \u22122.0 Log 2 FC. Eighteen significantly upregulated pathways were identified by InnateDB enrichment analysis. These pathways involved apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, pathogen recognition, Jak-STAT signaling, NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, several chronic infectious diseases, graft versus host disease, allograft rejection and certain autoimmune disorders. Infected peritoneal macrophages were activated M1 type based on pattern of RNA expression. Apoptosis was found to involve large virus-laden peritoneal macrophages more than less mature macrophages, suggesting that macrophage death played a role in virus dissemination. Gene transcripts for MHC I but not II receptors were upregulated, while mRNA for receptors commonly associated with virus attachment and identified in other coronaviruses were either not detected (APN, L-SIGN), not deregulated (DDP-4) or down-regulated (DC-SIGN). However, the mRNA for Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16A/ADCC receptor) was significantly upregulated, supporting entry of virus as an immune complex. Analysis of KEGG associated gene transcripts indicated that Th1 polarization overshadowed Th2 polarization, but the addition of relevant B cell associated genes previously linked to FIP macrophages tended to alter this perception.",

            "text": "Macrophages are the main host cell supporting FIPV replication in vivo [1] . It is therefore important to study how FIPV infected macrophages respond to infection, because they also mediate the resultant immune/inflammatory responses. FIPV replication appears to be very cell associated throughout the disease course and there appears to be no discernable cell-free viremia [1] . However, it appears that virus may spread to distant sites within these cells, as similar appearing infected macrophages dominate in organs such as the brain [2, 3]. Attempts to mimic this infection in vitro have relied heavily on monocyte/ macrophage cultures derived from PBMC rather than on actual peritoneal-type macrophages. Although monocyte cultures internalize FIPV much more efficiently than CRFK cells [4] , virus replication in such cultures tends to be low and is not sustained in a chronic state as in nature. It is unlikely that the interaction between FIPV and macrophages can be easily mimicked by in vitro cell culture systems using other cell types.",

The omentum and mesentery were diffusely irregularly thickened by sheets of inflammatory cells on the peritoneal surface and multifocally within the adipose parenchyma. The sheet of inflammatory cells on the peritoneal surface of the omentum was comprised of large numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, and lesser numbers of scattered small lymphocytes ( Figures 1A and B) . The adipose tissue of the omentum was multifocally expanded by lymphoid aggregates centered around blood vessels and scattered lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that a large proportion of cells in the exudate lining the omentum were large CD18 immunoreactive round cells ( Figure 1C ), consistent with monocyte/macrophages. A small proportion of scattered cells were immunoreactive for CD3 (T lymphocyte marker, Figure 1D ) and very few cells immunoreactive for CD79\u03b1 (B lymphocyte marker, Figure 1E ). The specific cellular targets for apoptosis were determined by TUNEL staining and the FIPV infection status of stained cells interrogated by a combination of DIFA staining using polyclonal cat Ig and indirect immunoperoxidase staining using a mouse monoclonal antibody to the FIPV N protein. Omentum with FIP lesions was used as the target tissue. TUNEL-positive cells were scattered on the peritoneal surface of the inflamed omentum and comprised ~ 10% of the total cells ( Figure 1F ). The morphology of the strongly staining cells was characteristic for activated macrophages, i.e., they were large and highly vacuolated ( Figure 1G ). Apoptosis in the omentum was limited to large highly vacuolated macrophages and TUNEL stained lymphocytes and neutrophils were sparse even though there was an extensive lymphocytic/neutrophilic infiltrate. Therefore, the spleen was also examined by IHC and TUNEL staining. Unlike the omentum, lymphoid cells were arranged in a more orchestrated (reactive) manner around existing structures such as germinal centers and marginal zones. Apoptotic cells were concentrated in the germinal centers of splenic lymphoid follicles (Figures 2A and B) . These were presumably B cells based on IHC. This response may have been related or unrelated to the FIPV infection. Some unidentified cells in the marginal zones were faintly stained by TUNEL.",

Although the results of the present study supported these earlier published results, such studies used serotype II, tissue-culture adapted FIPV on an atypical host cell (e.g., CRFK cells) and employed a limited number of replicates. The present study used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in peritoneal cells from four healthy cats with gene expression from peritoneal cells of 11 cats that had been experimentally infected with non-tissue culture adapted serotype I FIPV, which more closely paralleled the natural infection. The present study also identified a greater number of significantly dysregulated genes (5621), with many of them expressed at levels 200-fold higher (956) or lower (1589) in FIPV infected versus normal peritoneal cells. There were two inherent limitations of the present study, purity of cells and accuracy of RNA-seq as a predictor of cytokine translation. Peritoneal cells were not purified, because any purification method would likely cause significant changes in differential gene expression profiles. This lack of purity was not seen as a problem, as peritoneal cells collected from both healthy and diseased cats contained a predominance of macrophage-type cells. Eosinophils were present in the normal peritoneal exudate cell population but made no contribution whatsoever to the cells in peritoneal exudate from cats with FIP. Neutrophils were present in both populations but did not appear grossly activated in either situation in stained smears. Finally, the differentially expressed genes were associated mainly with macrophage type cells and not with neutrophils. Therefore, the assumption was that the present differential gene expression profiles reflected primarily macrophage-type cells.",

Despite the inconsistencies, researchers still see value in RNAseq analyses, especially when translated proteins have a short half-life and the genetic complexity of the system being studied is low [27] . It appears that the half-life of cytokines generated by infected/activated macrophages in this experimental FIPV infection model is very short. Fever and lymphopenia appear suddenly with the onset of peritonitis [1] and disappear within hours of virus inhibition using a potent anti-viral drug [12] .

A more focused interpretation of the data was obtained from functional gene pathways, especially those identified by InnateDB, Qiagen, and KEGG databases. Only three InnateDB pathways were significantly under-expressed, all related to normal cellular functions, while 18 pathways were over-expressed. Four of the most significant up-regulated pathways were associated with microbe recognition-toll-like receptor signaling, RIG-I-like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Recognition of a foreign invasion, and in this case by an RNA virus, is the essential first step in the initiation of an immune and/ or inflammatory response. It is also noteworthy that five of the eighteen most significantly upregulated InnateDB pathways were associated with infectious agents such as hepatitis C virus (another RNA virus), leishmaniasis, American and African trypanosomiasis, and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are all associated with pathogens of macrophages (except for hepatitis C virus) that result in persistent intracellular infections and disease. FIPV is the only RNA virus known to cause granulomatous lesions that mirror those of classic non-viral macrophage pathogens [28, 29] and it is understandable why systemic feline mycobacteriosis is nearest in clinical and pathologic features to FIP [30] . It is also noteworthy that two InnateDB pathways resembled those associated with graft versus host disease and allograft rejection, while two other pathways were shared with type I diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis. These conditions all involved problems in differentiating self from non-self that lead to inflammation. Reasons for upregulation of the osteoclast differentiation pathway was more difficult to understand.",

M1 (killer) macrophages are activated by LPS and IFN-gamma, and secrete high levels of IL12 and low levels of IL10. This pattern was confirmed by mRNA expression with IL10 mRNA being down-regulated and IL12 mRNA upregulated. Although brief expression of mRNAs associated with M1 macrophages may be beneficial, excessive and/or prolonged M1 polarization can lead to pathogen-induced inflammation rather than immunity [31] .

Among alphacoronaviruses, human Table 9 Differential expression profile of genes related to Th1 and Th2 cell bronchitis virus NL63 uses ACE2, HCOV-229E L-SIGN, and TGEV and PRCV bind to aminopeptidase N (APN). The betacoronaviruses MERS and SARS bind to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), respectively. However, the route by which FIPV infects monocytes and macrophages is much less certain, but both APN and DC-SIGN have been implicated at one time or another. Aminopeptidase N was initially identified as the receptor for all group I feline, canine, porcine and human coronaviruses [41] and later cited as a receptor for serotype II but not for serotype I FIPVs [42] . Subsequent in vitro studies also indicated that the predominant serotype I strains of FIPVs found in nature do not use aminopeptidase N as a receptor [5, 43, 44] . Blocking of aminopeptidase N receptors has also no effect on serotype I FIPV binding and infection of feline monocyte cultures [45] . mRNA for aminopeptidase N was not identified in peritoneal exudate cells from serotype I FIPV infected cats in the present study, further supporting its non-essential role in FIPV infection of monocytes and macrophages. There is evidence that serotype I strains of FIPV may use DC-SIGN to bind and infect cultured CRFK cells [46] . Van Hamme et al. [45] also found that blocking of DC-SIGN inhibited binding of serotype I FIPV to feline monocyte cultures by one-third and infection by 80%. However, DC-SIGN mRNA was significantly underexpressed in the peritoneal exudate cells from cats with FIP, making it an unlikely receptor for in vivo infection. A related lectin, L-SIGN (CD209L), has been shown to be the receptor for the closely related human coronavirus 229E [47] . L-SIGN is expressed at high levels by hepatic cells [48] and is a high affinity receptor for hepatitis C virus [48] . An mRNA for L-SIGN was not detected in the present study. Likewise, the mRNA for ACE2 was also not detected, while the mRNA for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was upregulated, but below the level of the study cutoff of plus or minus Log 2 FC. The down-regulation of DC-SIGN mRNA was unexpected, as it functions as an attachment receptor for enveloped viruses such as hepatitis C virus [48] by a process known as cis-infection. Trans-infection of dendritic cells by cytomegalovirus, whereby virus infection goes from one cell type to another, has also been associated with DC-SIGN [49] . HIV-1 also uses DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressed by antigen presenting cells for its delivery to target cells such as CD4 + lymphocytes by trans-infection [50] . DC-SIGN may also be important in the capture and internalization of these pathogens for processing and antigen presentation and not merely replication [51] .",

A common feature of the pathogens mentioned above is that they all can cause chronic infections that last a lifetime. This persistence has been linked to how DC-and L-SIGN and pathogen interact. Hepatis C virus can misuse DC-and L-SIGN by certain mechanisms to escape lysosomal degradation [52] . This \"misuse\" of DC-SIGN is thought to circumvent antigen processing or alter TLRmediated signaling and skew immune responses towards Th2 rather than Th1 [53] . A Th2 type immune response to infection with S. mansoni is associated with its persistence and soluble carbohydrate egg antigens can cause a switch towards a Th2-cell-mediated immune response [54] . Mycobacteria may also target DC-SIGN to suppress DC function and modulate immune responses [55] . Therefore, the paradoxical down-regulation of DC-SIGN in FIPV infected macrophages may be one explanation for FIPV persistence in those cats that fail to contain the virus within the first few days following infection [1].",

Although there are several Fc receptors, Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16a) was the only Fc receptor gene that was both detected and over-expressed to a noticeable level in peritoneal exudate cells from cats with FIP. The likely sources of Fc\u03b3RIIIA mRNA were NK cells, monocyte/ macrophages and neutrophils. Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the receptor on NK cells responsible for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). An important, and yet to be confirmed role for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, is as a means for macrophage infection by FIPV. There is evidence that FIPV antibody binding is involved in the internalization of FIPV by macrophages [6] and that this process involves an Fc-type receptor [7] as shown for flaviviruses [57] .",

It is also widely believed that innate host defenses are crucial in the initial control of an infection but that they are insufficient for ultimate pathogen clearance [59] . It follows that survival of pathogens in macrophages is due to inhibition of adaptive (presumably cellular) immunity [60] . However, evidence that cellular immunity is crucial for preventing FIP is sparse and largely indirect. PBMC or whole blood cultures from FIPV immune cats proliferate in response to live virus exposure in vitro [57] and produce IFN\u03b3 in response to T cell epitopes of the viral N protein [61] . Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses can be elicited in the palpebral mucosa [58] or skin [62] with FIPV antigen in immune cats. The occurrence of FIP is also much higher in FECV enzootic cats naturally infected with feline leukemia virus, a known T cell immunosuppressive retrovirus [63] . The most convincing evidence for the role of cellular immunity comes from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. MHV, like FECV/FIPV, is a coronavirus that exists in enteric (wildtype) and systemic (mutated by laboratory passage) biotypes [64] . Infection of IFN\u03b3 deficient mice with systemic MHV caused a disease virtually identical to FIP [65] . It is also noteworthy that enteric MHV infection of B cell deficient mice causes a more prolonged intestinal infection, while the same virus in T cell deficient mice causes an FIP-like disease like what occurs when systemic MHV is inoculated into IFN\u03b3 deficient mice [66] . This suggests that FECV infection is controlled more by B-cell immunity, while FIPV infection is controlled by T-cell immunity.",

Evidence that favored Th2 pathway activation was not apparent from analysis of KEGG selected genes. Deficient Th2 associated polarization became less obvious when IL6, CD40, BAFF and Blimp-1 (PRDM1) genes were added to the list of KEGG Th2 differentiation genes.

CD40L expressed by T cells can provide signals to B cells that induce proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, antibody secretion and prevention of apoptosis during B cell differentiation [67] . BAFF is expressed in B cell lineage cells and plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of B cells [69] .
