            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major public health problem causing approximately 1.9 million child deaths in 2000 [1] . About 20% of child mortality (,5 years) is due to pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis and 90% of them are attributed to pneumonia [2] . Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and hospitalization in developed countries and a major cause of mortality among children living in developing countries [3] where socio-economic issues such as malnutrition are aggravating factors. To date, it is difficult to reliably predict the pathogen based on clinical signs and symptoms [4] . Respiratory pathogens etiologies could help to better understand acute febrile illnesses in malaria endemic area and orient adapted therapies. Viruses were considered as causative agents of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) and have been investigated in several studies [5] . Since 2001, several new respiratory viruses have been described such as metapneumovirus (HMPV) [6] , human coronavirus (HCoV), NL63 [7] and HKU1 [8] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [9] . Various respiratory viruses that caused epidemics and pandemic, such as swine lineage influenza ALRIs A (H1N1) virus infection, in 2009, have heightened the need to develop sensitive and rapid diagnostic test. The development of molecular methods such as multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) greatly facilitates the etiological study of respiratory infections but it does not, especially in developing countries, assist the clinician in the care of patient. Madagascar is a country with low HIV prevalence (estimated at 0.2% in 2010 [10] ) and malaria is endemic with stable transmission during all year on the East Coast. Recent studies on surveillance of fever among child result in malaria over-diagnosis with consequent under diagnosis of other fever-causing disorders such as pneumonia [11] . Little is known about the pathogens responsible for ARIs especially in rural areas. A recent study shows that respiratory viruses play an important role in children under 5 years old consulting in public and private clinics in Antananarivo with Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILIs) symptoms [12] . In Ampasimanjeva, a small village located in a rural area endemic for malaria, a recent study showed that 68% of acute fever illnesses among children are not explained by malaria (Ratsimbasoa, personal communication). The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of a large panel of respiratory pathogens including viruses and atypical bacteria among a well clinically defined cohort of acute febrile children between 2 to 59 months of age presenting clinical ARIs symptoms in Ampasimanjeva.",

Between February 2010 and February 2011, each child presenting an axillary temperature .37.5uC or a history of fever within the previous 24 hours was followed-up by physicians. First, each febrile child was evaluated with a rapid diagnostic test for malaria. Those positive for malaria (n = 21) were treated with Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and were not enrolled in the study. Those with a negative test for malaria (n = 916) and presenting symptoms of acute respiratory infections (n = 295) defined by the presence of Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) signs or auscultatory signs were included in the study. Among the 295 children enrolled, 24.1% (71/295) had taken an antipyretic treatment and 6.8% (20/295) had declared taking antibiotics before consultation. After completing a full clinical record, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was performed on each child enrolled. The swab was placed in a universal transport medium (UTM, Copan) and stored at 4uC until sent to the Centre d'Infectiologie Charles M\u00e9rieux at Antananarivo, Madagascar for analysis. Pending the molecular diagnostic, biological samples were stored at 280uC.",

The rural community of Ampasimanjeva consists of seven villages located in south-eastern Madagascar (coordinates 21u 44 90 ''South/48u 29 0'' East) dominated by an equatorial climate with high humidity. Recently, 1,549 children under 5 years of age were referenced and among them, 937 presented a fever and were examined at the hospital during the study period. Of these children, 295 presented ARIs clinical signs and a negative test for malaria. To better understand the role of the viral and atypical Table 3 . Relationship between child temperature and ARI viral and bacterial etiologies. bacteria agents in nasopharyngeal swabs, we stratified the respiratory clinical symptoms into 4 major groups to obtain defined ARIs cohorts. Seventy five percent (n = 220) of the acute febrile children had a nasopharyngeal sample containing at least one virus or atypical bacterial agent. The low rate of negative specimens shows that the technique used in this study is highly sensitive and the spectrum of pathogens is large, covering most of those implicated in the ARIs. In this study, the frequently encountered pathogens were the HRV, HMPV A/B, HCoV, RSV A/B and HPIV. The most representative pathogens into the defined clinical groups were HMPV, HPIV, HRSV and HAdV for pneumonia, other ALRIs, Flu-like illnesses and URTI, respectively. The human rhinovirus, HMPV A/B and RSV A/B were single detected while HCoV, HPIV and HBoV were most often co-detected. Human rhinovirus was found largely in all clinical manifestations. HRV has long been considered to be a benign virus causing mild upper respiratory tract infections, but there is evidence that HRV is also involved in ALRIs [13] more specifically in bronchiolitis [14] , but its role is not yet well defined in pneumonia [15, 16] . HRV is frequently found as asymptomatic carriage [17, 18, 19] , a comprehensive study on genotypes from HRVpositive samples would be interesting. As, it seems that the new and potentially more pathogenic HRV-C which has been recently discovered [20, 21] is correlated with the severity of ARIs [22, 23] .",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we did not investigate the viral and atypical respiratory pathogens in control population as asymptomatic carriers. This could limit our interpretation to ascribe the etiological agents to the defined clinical groups. However, some of the potential etiological agents described here are rarely identified or less common in asymptomatic patients, except for rhinoviruses [19, 34, 35] . A longitudinal case/control study would be interesting to validate the relevance of these agents in acute respiratory infections despite the difficulty to obtain approval requirements from ethical committee. Our results highlight a significant proportion of viruses among children with ARIs. However, the viral etiology of an infection does not exclude the coexistence of a bacterial infection nor superinfection, often observed, for example, with pneumococci following influenza virus infection [36] . The bacterial etiology could not be evaluated in this study but remains important enough to be investigated further. Using information gathered from clinical records, it appears that 87.5% of children received antibiotics as a result of auscultation. If only viruses are actually mostly the cause of ALRIs in Ampasimanjeva, simple recommendations such as those proposed by WHO and UNICEF [37] could reduce the morbidity and mortality. Secondly, we did not evaluate the proportion of respiratory pathogens among children with malaria (n = 21). In the absence of appropriate diagnostic tools in low income countries, integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) at health facilities is presumptive and symptom-based: fever for malaria, and fever/cough/difficult breathing for pneumonia. These overlapping symptoms, compatible both with malaria and pneumonia, necessitating dual treatment, need to be evaluated in further studies. Unexplained acute febrile illness is the only common factor in children living in endemic malaria region. In this study, we showed that the fever cannot be considered alone to guide clinical diagnosis. Moreover, respiratory pathogens do not seem to be related to fever prognosis except for Influenza viruses. Finally, the interpretation of the fever may be biased by the use of antipyretic treatment, and 24.1% of our patients had evidence of antipyretic use before study enrollment. Finally, this study was conducted over one year, covering both hot/rainy and cold/dry seasons, to get a preliminary description of respiratory pathogens and respiratory pathogens spread during this period. This short time period should be prolonged to deepen our knowledge about these pathogens and perhaps anticipate epidemics in light of improving the health care of children.",
