The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2-4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling).",

ARI epidemics need be recognized as soon as possible if prevention and mitigation measures are to be effective [6, 7] . The electronic medical record (EMR) includes numerous entries (e.g. clinical notes, vital signs, diagnostic codes, test results) that could combine to facilitate the discovery of individual cases [8, 9] or outbreaks of ARI [10] . In integrated health delivery systems, EMR data originate across the continuum of care, from ambulatory visits to intensive care units. A monitoring system rooted in such a comprehensive EMR implementation could provide early insight into outbreak severity and support the flow of information necessary to manage specific patients as well as the overall epidemic [11] [12] [13] .",

In this context, we asked if statistical methods that consider longterm EMR data patterns could benefit ARI epidemic detection. Because most ARI result from viral diseases that exhibit marked seasonality, we hypothesized that fitting multi-year timeseries of daily ARI case counts with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SAR-IMA) models [15, 16] could accelerate epidemic detection, compared to methods that base their forecasting on the recent past only [17] . To begin to test this hypothesis, we used software to recreate surveillance systems operating prospectively on synthetic or authentic historical datasets. Our results suggest that, under realistic surveillance conditions, SARIMA could help shorten outbreak detection delay.",

EMR entries were extracted from Veterans Integrated Service Technology Architecture hierarchical databases (MDE v.6.1.0.0, Strategic Reporting Systems, Inc. Peabody MA) and transferred to relational databases (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp, Redmond CA). We used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases, defined as: [Positive influenza culture/antigen OR Any two of the following, of no more than 7 days duration: cough; fever or chills or night sweats; pleuritic chest pain; myalgia; sore throat; headache] AND Illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology [8] . We chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th version) included in an ARIrelated set used by a surveillance system of national scope [19] ; b) CDA2 (sensitivity 69%, PPV 54%) retrieved outpatient visits assigned a diagnostic code that belonged to a grouping modified for increased performance at the VA [8] ), and where automated text analysis of the visitrelated clinical note(s) identified at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition [8, 20] . CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10] , illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone; c) CDA3 retrieved CDA2 patients subset with a core body temperature of more than 37.8\u02daC measured on the day of their index visit (sensitivity 71%, PPV 68%). Our rationale for choosing CDA3 was that while its high performance could translate into timely epidemic detection, low daily case counts could represent a challenging substrate for time series modeling. To generate CDA-specific time series of daily case counts, each ARI CDA was applied to a relational database containing EMR documentation of outpatient clinical encounters [8] over a 7-year period, from January 1999 to December 2005. These time series formed the basis for the authentic \"backgrounds\" used for the whole-system simulations (see Fig 1A ( insert), Table 1 , and S1 File). EMR data included in CDA 1-3 have been extracted daily at the VAMHCS. Thus, any of the CDA tested could be incorporated in a prospective surveillance system.",

The proportion of community cases presenting to the VA Maryland Health Care System was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [22] .

We wrote software to simulate prospective surveillance systems operating on the authentic historical background datasets described above (R v. 2.10.1, http://www.r-project.org). The software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. Starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series, and to the \"Background-only\" time series. The value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. The 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods (from August 1 st 2002 to July 31 st 2003, and from August 1 st 2003 to July 31 st 2004). In a final phase, the software applied a family of threshold values beyond which the computed daily statistics would constitute an \"alarm\". On a given day and for a given threshold, an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a \"false alarm\". An alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \"true alarm\" (Fig 1B and 1C) . For a given alarm threshold, the software computed two benchmarks: 1) the \"Detection Delay\", the time from outbreak injection to the first true alarm, averaged for the 52 weekly surveillance cycles for a given one-year study period; 2) the daily false alarm rate (FAR), defined as the number of unique false alarms during the evaluation year, divided by 365 days. Corresponding pairs of Detection Delay and FAR were computed over broad ranges of alarm thresholds and used to plot CDA-specific activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [23] .",

To gain insight into year-to-year variation in system performance, we performed surveillance simulations over two different one-year time periods: a) 8/2002-7/2003, a year with an average ARI incidence; and b) 8/2003-7/2004, a year with a high seasonal incidence of ARIs. In keeping with prior observations [10] , EARS-based surveillance exhibited a better performance when using CDA2 for ARI case detection than when using CDA1, with consistently shorter outbreak detection delay at any FAR for both study periods (in Fig 3, Fig 3A (2002-03) and Fig 3B (2003-04) ; for CDA2, compare open black to closed red squares in Fig 3C (2002-03) and Fig 3D  (2003-04) ). Gains in timeliness due to SARIMA were highest at low FAR and were larger for CDA1 than for CDA2 (in Fig 3, compare the distance between the black and red tracings in panels A and B to that in panels C and D). Examination of the AMOC curves in Fig 3 suggests that at the commonly used daily FAR of 1%, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by~14-16 days for CDA1, and by~5 days for CDA2.",

We avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic, as this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. Our comparison period thus began on May 24 and ended August 22, before the very large second wave of the epidemic reached Baltimore. During this period, there were peaks in laboratory-based surveillance for pH1N1 in Baltimore, MD, but no corresponding local peak of ARI visits observed in CDC's BioSense syndromic surveillance system.",

Some of these methods have been applied to the same data sets and formally compared [18, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Of the two studies that addressed the value of historical data, a generalized linear model (GLM) that took advantage of 3 years of past data often outperformed EARS [39] , whereas a seasonally adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) method did not [18] . Even though a number of explanations could help reconcile these results, we note that as the size of an epidemic signal increases relative to the background noise, outbreak recognition becomes easier and the performance of alternative detection methods becomes more and more difficult to distinguish [39, 41] . This rationale could explain why the GLM approach implemented by Jackson et al. did not add value under all conditions, but performed well with slow-escalating outbreaks qualitatively similar to the one used in our study [39] . In our particular real-world case, we found SARIMA to be more sensitive than EARS at discovering signals related to the pH1N1 pandemic wave that hit Baltimore in the summer of 2009. However, there was no associated timeliness advantage to SAR-IMA, as the initial peak of ARI cases was large enough to be picked by both statistical approaches. Given the variability in real-world outbreak signals, a negative finding for one specific outbreak does not reduce the impetus to design ever more sensitive and specific surveillance systems.",
