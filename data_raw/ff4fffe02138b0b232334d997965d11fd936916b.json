The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.",

CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study. The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter. The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (r s = 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall. An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (r s = 0.55, P = 0.0005).",

Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in LRTI and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged <5 years also in developing countries [6] . This was confirmed in a WHO-sponsored denominator-based study of RSV-associated LRTI in four developing countries [7] . Moreover, while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe LRTI in otherwise healthy children in highincome countries [8] , little information on its epidemiology is available from resource-poor settings. A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published, but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [9] [10] [11] . Seasonality of RSV and influenza in tropical and sub-tropical regions differs from the well-defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates, and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [1, 12] . Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures, such as development and introduction of vaccines in low-and middle-income countries.",

In brief, nucleic acids were extracted from 360 \u03bcl of NPA (or plasmid RNA from positive control transcripts) using a nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control (virus transport medium), starting at nucleic acid isolation. Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 \u03bcl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors. cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (ABI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), RNase inhibitor (ABI) and 3 \u03bcl of extracted viral RNA. Amplification reactions were performed using GeneAmp \u00ae PCR System 2700 (ABI). Ten \u03bcl of newly synthesized cDNA was added to a mix consisting of 2.5 U of AmpliTaq \u00ae Gold DNA polymerase (ABI) and a Super-Mix containing seven pairs of forward and backward primers flanking unique sequences of the seven viruses (the hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1, 2 and 3, the matrix protein gene of InfA, the NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB, the NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV). After initially holding the PCR mixture at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, amplification was performed as follows: two cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and then 38 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by an additional 7 min at 72\u00b0C and immediate cooling to 4\u00b0C.

It should be noted that many of these studies also included measles. A recently published denominator-based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three RSV epidemics reported that 13% of cases with LRTI were attributable to RSV infection, which was diagnosed using IF [31] . In India, RSV accounted for 17% of hospitalized cases with LRTI in New Delhi [32] and 7% of LRTI cases included in a 3-year longitudinal community study in Haryana [28] . After RSV, InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study, as reported elsewhere [1, 3, 28] . We detected hMPV in 4.2% of pneumonia cases. It is estimated that MPV worldwide accounts for 5 to 7% of ARI in young children requiring hospitalization [33] . In India, hMPV was detected in 3.2% of 662 children hospitalized for ARI over a 2-year period from April 2005 [34] .",

However, the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear. Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival, transmission efficiency, and host immunity, or have an indirect effect through climatedependent behavior change, such as indoor crowding and eating habits [55] . We detected more than one virus in 3.3% of the virus-positive NPA specimens, which is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study [56] , but lower compared with studies using molecular methods detecting a wider array of viruses [57, 58] . The frequency of viral co-detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [59] and the number of pathogens tested for [58] . By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses, a study in 515 Korean children aged \u2264 5 years detected viruses in 312 (60.6%) of cases and a viral co-detection in 36 (11.5%) [45] . In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study, the Korean study also detected adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus; and, notably, the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co-detections. The clinical role of bocavirus in pneumonia in otherwise healthy children is unclear [60, 61] , as is the importance of multiple viral infections [57, 59] . Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co-detections [61] , as could case-control studies.",

Moreover, by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours, we primarily recruited new cases of pneumonia.

A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel. Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [64] . Atypical bacteria, like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cause pneumonia more frequently in school-age children, but can also cause mild infections in younger children [65] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia. However, nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy, young children [66] . Moreover, their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [67] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings. S. pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus-associated pneumonia in children in hospital, especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [68] . The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 (Figure 2) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B (Figure 3 ). There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [69] . Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection. Again, quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia.",

RSV was the most common agent isolated, and occurred with considerable temporal variation. As for many other common childhood infections, such as diarrhea, the occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures in resource-poor settings.

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.",
