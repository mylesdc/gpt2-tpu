            "text": "We compare two broad types of empirically grounded random network models in terms of their abilities to capture both network features and simulated Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics. The types of network models are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and extensions of the configuration model. We use three kinds of empirical contact networks, chosen to provide both variety and realistic patterns of human contact: a highly clustered network, a bipartite network and a snowball sampled network of a \"hidden population\". In the case of the snowball sampled network we present a novel method for fitting an edge-triangle model. In our results, ERGMs consistently capture clustering as well or better than configuration-type models, but the latter models better capture the node degree distribution. Despite the additional computational requirements to fit ERGMs to empirical networks, the use of ERGMs provides only a slight improvement in the ability of the models to recreate epidemic features of the empirical network in simulated SIR epidemics. Generally, SIR epidemic results from using configuration-type models fall between those from a random network model (i.e., an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model) and an ERGM. The addition of subgraphs of size four to edge-triangle type models does improve agreement with the empirical network for smaller densities in clustered networks. Additional subgraphs do not make a noticeable difference in our example, although we would expect the ability to model cliques to be helpful for contact networks exhibiting household structure.",

They also derive a solution for final epidemic size of clustered networks that is asymptotically exact for large network sizes using bond percolation approximation methods. Importantly they also extend their results on epidemic dynamics beyond edge-triangle configuration networks to a further generalisation that includes cliques (i.e., fully connected subgraphs) of size 4 and above to model household structure. Cliques of size n are included in the network model by analogy with trianglessize n clique corners are counted in addition to stubs and triangle corners. We note two of their key results. 1) The global clustering coefficient is not sufficient to determine the full epidemiological impact of clustering. Comparing with a different model [13] such that the two models are calibrated to have the same degree distribution, the same global clustering coefficient and the same disease parameters, epidemic dynamics can be quite different, especially when clustering is extensive. Thus, the specific nature of the clustering appears relevant for epidemic dynamics. 2) Clustering slows epidemics and reduces final size, at least for a particular subclass of edge-triangle networks considered (negative binomial degree distribution, tunable fraction of edges in triangles, mean and variance of the degree distribution held constant).",

For example, the necessary generating functions are provided for edges, triangles, squares, diamonds (a square with diagonal, also known as a 2-triangle), and 4-cliques. The joint distribution for node \"roles\" is the key distribution of interest. These five subgraphs require six node roles (i.e., two for the diamond).

            "text": "It is recognised that contact networks can play an important role in studying and understanding epidemic dynamics [1] . For these purposes, network models are important for at least two reasons. First, researchers may have an empirical network, but want to simulate additional, similar networks to avoid \"over-fitting\" to the particular observed network. Second, researchers may have no data on empirical contact patterns, so use a model, possibly informed by an empirical or textbook distribution, for example. One family of network models arises from a collection of network research expanding on the standard \"configuration model\" [2, 3] . An alternative approach uses the family of Exponential Random Graph models [4] , combined with simulation of disease transmission. In this paper we try to make some progress in bridging these two network modelling domains in the context of network epidemiology. We do not try to investigate the effects of node degree variation or clustering on epidemic dynamics, per se. (Welch et al. [1] has a nice summary of current results.) Nor do we study the suitability of theoretical solutions, that are asymptotically correct, to finite empirical network sizes. (We recognise some researchers use variations of the configuration model, but then simulate a disease transmission process.) Rather, we are trying to make some progress in understanding which subgraphs are relevant to the study of epidemic dynamics and how the strengths and shortcomings of each modelling domain affect conclusions on epidemic dynamics. A key feature of our work is a focus on empirical contact networks, which therefore have realistic patterns of human contact.",

Key quantities of interest like final size, epidemic duration, and the infectivity threshold for epidemics, are solvable without explicit stochastic simulation of the epidemic (e.g., using a system of ODEs or bond percolation results). 4) Variability in quantities of interest are also solvable.

Summation is over all possible subgraph configurations C, \u03b8 C is a parameter corresponding to the configuration C and is non-zero only if all pairs of networks variables in C are conditionally dependent, z C (y) = \u220f (i, j)2C y ij is the network statistic corresponding to the configuration C (indicating whether all ties in C are observed in y), and \u03ba is a normalizing constant which ensures Eq (2) describes a proper distribution. The homogeneity assumption means there can be one parameter for each configuration, thus reducing the number of sufficient statistics to specify the model. As has been pointed out (e.g., [15] ), in practice ERGMs are difficult to analyse and can display pathological behaviours that limit their usefulness. The former concern is certainly true in the general case, although there has been some progress [19] . Realistically, the study of both ERGM networks and epidemic dynamics on ERGM networks must rely on stochastic simulation of both the networks and epidemics on the networks. Pathological behaviours, which often make model fitting difficult for the earlier Markov models, are less serious with new social circuit specifications for ERGMs [16, 20] . In addition, several other concerns might be raised. 1) Model fitting currently requires Markov Chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMCMLE) techniques that become computationally intensive as the number of nodes and edges grows. This imposes a practical constraint on the size of networks that can be modelled with ERGMs (although the new snowball methods-see below-open possibilities for parameter estimation of large networks). 2) Model fitting has generally assumed the entire network has been observed, which is unrealistic for large networks. However, recent results [21] have relaxed this \"whole network\" requirement such that a \"snowball sample\" [22] can be used. An alternative approach for less than whole-network data has also been proposed [23] . 3) Model fitting can be tricky, requiring the \"right\" collection of configurations to be included to adequately capture network features. network census [26] [27] [28] . 1) High degree nodes are more likely to appear in the sample, so their probability will be over-estimated. 2) The samples are sensitive to the initial seed nodes chosen, which in practice may be a convenience sample rather than a random sample. 3) Homophily within the population can lead to some sub-groups being over-or under-represented in the sample, particularly if the set of seed nodes poorly represents the population. While there are techniques to fit ERGMs to snowball sampled data [21] , we are not aware of a technique to estimate a network's node role distribution from a snowball sample. For the purposes of this paper we propose a method to estimate the joint distribution of stubs and corners, thus fitting an edge-triangle model.",

For this study we consider networks given by 75, 60 and 6 minute durations (referred to as HS75, HS60 and HS6 respectively), which give a range of densities. Clearly the network ties from larger c are a subset of the ties from smaller c. We use these three networks to illustrate the effects of increasing network density and connectivity. Details of the networks are provided in Table 1 . (To confine comparisons of simulated epidemics to similarly sized networks, isolates have been removed from HS75 and HS60 networks.) Mean node degree increases from 2.5 to 57.5 as shorter duration contacts are included. We also show maximal clique sizes. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be made larger by including an adjacent node (i.e., not a subset of a larger clique). Maximal clique sizes range from 1 to 4 nodes for HS75, to between 1 and 25 nodes for HS6. Loosely, HS75 is a sparse network with small cliques while HS6 is dense with high mean numbers of contacts and large cliques.",

Of course, as network density increases, large maximal cliques arise as a consequence of the network having many edges.

They do not say how to count the subgraphs to create the role sequence or estimate its distribution. To model an empirical network this is most critical. Here we describe our method to form the node role sequence by decomposing the empirical network. For example, to fit an edge-triangle model we first count triangle corners at each node, subject to the condition that two triangles cannot share an edge. Thus, once an edge is identified for a triangle, it is removed from use in future triangles. In this sense we \"decompose\" the empirical network by removing edges as node roles are assigned. Edges not counted as part of a triangle are counted as stubs at their incidence nodes and account for all remaining edges. This approach can be generalised when additional subgraphs are included in the model, as described in S1 Appendix for the decomposition for the model with the largest number of subgraphs (i.e., our fourth variation). Finally we note that how one decomposes the empirical network into non-overlapping subgraphs is not unique. In this study the decomposition generally occurs in decreasing size/complexity, starting with the cliques of at least five nodes (most nodes to fewest nodes) and ending with stubs, as shown in S1 Appendix. Note that node roles for triangles are assigned before node roles for 4-cycles to give the most favourable opportunity to capture clustering. Node roles for the truss are assigned after 3-triangles and 4-cliques, but before diamonds, which are a subgraph of the truss.",

Since the quality of that fit would affect our results, using the observed node role sequence provides more controlled comparisons. Joining random stubs and corners can create self-loops and multiple edges. It has been suggested to maintain these ties [15] since excluding them makes theoretical calculations more difficult. Asymptotically, as the number of nodes grows the density of self-loops and multiple edges goes to zero, so they are not such a concern for larger networks. As in [12] , we choose to delete them. Self-loops do not add to epidemic dynamics. Multiple edges do not fit within the framework of a binary incidence matrix, and are inconsistent with decomposing the empirical network into subgraphs that do not share edges.",

The general approach to fitting an ERGM is to select a collection of configurations and use MCMCMLE to estimate parameters while MCMC simulation is used to evaluate model fit and simulate from models. All ERGMs for the high school networks in this study contain five configurations for structure and one configuration for homophily based on person type. The edge configuration controls network density. An \"isolates\" term controls the number of isolates produced by the model. Where the number of isolates in the empirical network is zero, this parameter helps keep the number of isolates small.

In short, we consider six estimators for the node degree distribution, form an estimate for a node's number of triangle corners conditional on it's degree, simulate networks and form snowball samples to identify which estimated node degree distribution produces snowball samples most like the observed sample. The choice of an estimator for the node degree distribution is not straightforward and balances effects such as bias from the higher likelihood of including nodes of high degree in a snowball sample, reduced data from excluding particular waves of the snowball, and deviations from simplifying assumptions and approximations.

Edge-triangle type models here use the node role sequence, which is not parsimonious, so we do not list the counts for the various node roles of each node here. On the other hand, ERGMs often have only a few parameters so the model is easily expressed. Table 3 shows the ERGM specification for a model of the HS75 network. Table 4 shows the goodness-of-fit results (burn-in 10 8 iterations, 20 000 iterations per network, 4000 networks). Column 1 lists the various statistics that are observed. Column 2 shows the value of the statistic for the empirical network (\"Sample\"). Columns 3 and 4 show the mean (\"Mean\") and sample standard deviation (\"Std. Dev.\"), respectively, of the statistic over simulated networks. Column 5 shows the \"t-ratio\", defined as (X \u2212 m)/s where X is the observed value, and m and s are the sample mean and sample standard deviation across the simulated networks, respectively. For each parameter, using standard methodology, the model is considered to be a good fit for the empirical network if the t-ratio has absolute value less than 0.1 for parameters explicitly in the model (shown in boldface) and less than 2 otherwise. Under a Gaussian distribution approximation these roughly correspond to the middle 8% and 95% of a parameter's distribution, respectively. Column six shows this requirement expressed as an interval (\"Goodness-of-Fit Interval\") given by (m \u2212 cs, m + cs) where c = 0.1 for statistics explicitly fit in the model and c = 2 otherwise. For each parameter, the model is a good fit if the observed statistic lies within it's goodness-of-fit interval. The model itself is a good fit if all the parameters have good fit. The ability of this model specification to closely capture all these features of the empirical network, including ones not explicitly modelled, is strong evidence that a useful model has been specified. Empirical values are shown along with the sample mean (\"Mean\") and sample standard deviation (\"Std. Dev.\") across 4000 simulations. The sample mean and standard deviation are expressed as a t-ratio in column five and a goodness-of-fit interval in column six. For all parameters the absolute t-ratio is always smaller than 0.1 for parameters explicitly modelled, and smaller than 2 otherwise. Equivalently, the observed statistic always lies within it's goodness-of-fit interval. Based on standard methodology, the network model re-creates all these features of the empirical network to an acceptable standard.",

For probabilities of transmission near one, the distribution of those maxima will govern the distribution of the epidemic duration. Indeed, if nodes are infected and infectious for one time unit the epidemic duration from a randomly chosen seed node will be its maximum geodesic distance, plus one for the seed node infection. For the HS75 network, the mean of the nodewise maximum geodesic distances in the large component is 22.8. For the 468 nodes in the large component, 70 have their maximum to the end of the 8 node chain, and 385 have their maximum to the end of the 14 node chain, 13 are equidistant to both end nodes and three are additional nodes.

A tendency for a model to produce a bigger large component suggests bond percolation results will also predict larger epidemic final size. Fig 6 shows results for the estimated final size in the simulated SIR epidemics. For each probability of transmission and network model, results are reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval (across 100 networks) of the mean final size (across 1000 SIR simulations). The similarity in final size across models when the probability of transmission is near one reflects the similarity in large component size. Table 2 .) The results for probability of transmission larger than 0.7 (empirical network notably larger than all network models) reflect similar results in large component diameter. More precisely, for the observed network the epidemic duration when the probability of transmission is one is 23.7 (95% CI: 23.5-23.9), which can be understood as 1 time unit for the seed node and then one for each new infection. (Recall the mean of the nodewise maximum geodesic distances in the large component is 22.8.) Epidemics can vary in how long they take to get started. Miller [8] suggests time shifts to account for these differences before temporal averaging. To further investigate differences across network models, we aligned the start of epidemics by accounting for the variable times to achieve R min . For each simulation we record the time until just before R min is achieved, and the durations from that time until the peak incidence of the epidemic and until the epidemic is over. We find that across the network models, the mean times until R min is achieved are indistinguishable from each other and from results for the observed network (not shown for brevity). Further, graphs of the time from R min to both the epidemic peak and the end of the epidemic resemble Fig 7 but rescaled in the vertical direction (not shown for brevity). Importantly, even after accounting for the variability in the time for an epidemic to get started, epidemics still last longer (on average) on the observed network for probabilities of transmission larger than 0.7. Another quantity of interest, the proportion of simulations with epidemic outbreaks is similar to final size across the network models (not shown for brevity). In particular, it illustrates that for configuration-type networks, outbreaks are less likely to occur when additional clustering is present.",

Some of the network models considered here (especially the ERGM) are parameterised to capture such network features. However, even in a network with mean node degree of 2.5 we found only small differences arising from the ability of a network model to capture such features. A much larger difference is apparent from what might be considered the absence of clustering in our HS75 network due to long chains off a highly-connected core. The results on epidemic duration show similarity between edge-triangle models and the ERGM, and all show mean epidemic durations that are too short compared to the observed network. Long chains can slow an epidemic by increasing the number of transmissions required to reach nodes and might also increase the number of cutpoints in the network. Each cutpoint has the potential to interrupt the epidemic by transmission failure. Overall, this suggests there may be advantage in exploring subgraphs that promote longer chains in addition to ones that promote increased clustering.",

(Of course, all networks become clique-like with high enough density.) Clearly this difference must be balanced by the time spent to develop a model, elapsed time to obtain the model and computational effort to work with a model. In the case of the relationships network for example, in developing the ERGM, 31 models were considered (10 with fixed 9-star and same-sex edges) over the course of a week. Some modeller time was saved by performing estimations overnight. Goodness-of-fit results reported here require 2.5 hours to produce and are an essential step to ensure a useful network model has been found. Twelve earlier goodness-of-fit results (2-3 hours each) ruled out earlier models. In a best case scenario, one could anticipate the need to fix features of the network, and get lucky with the choice of configurations in the model. It is still unlikely to develop the model in under two days. On the other hand, fitting an edge-triangle model can be performed with less specialised expertise and in a negligible amount of time. For the purposes of network epidemiology (not network-based inference which is a separate, excellent domain for ERGMs) these issues must be carefully weighed.",

As an example, creating the largest node role sequence for the HS6 network (the largest, densest network used here, with many cliques) required less than eight minutes on a PC. After some effort optimizing the counting algorithms, it likely would perform faster. Because an edge is assigned to only one subgraph, a feature of the decomposition is that once an edge is assigned it can be removed from further consideration. Thus, decomposition of the network becomes less demanding as more edges are assigned to subgraphs. All of this suggests the number of nodes and edges for which the the configuration-type models are useful is at least several orders of magnitude larger than for ERGMs, with the usual provisos on memory and storage limitations for big networks, which are independent of the model.",

The three statistics of the fourth column (number of isolates, size of the largest component, diameter of the largest component (i.e., the maximum geodesic length between any two nodes in the largest component) show aspects of the connectivity of the networks. The diameter of the large component is relevant because when the probability of disease transmission is near one, the disease will propagate one hop per time unit. Thus, the large component diameter is an upper bound on the epidemic duration when the probability of disease transmission is near one and nodes are infected and infectious for one time unit. (If there were more than one seed node per component the epidemic duration would typically be less, but the large component diameter would still be indicative.)
