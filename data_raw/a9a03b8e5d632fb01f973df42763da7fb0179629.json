            "text": "Background. Flaviviridae viruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which threat human constantly mediated by mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies. Considering the recent increase in the prevalence of the family virus and its risk potential, we investigated the codon usage pattern to understand its evolutionary processes and provide some useful data to develop the medications for most of Flaviviridae viruses. Results. The overall extent of codon usage bias in 65 Flaviviridae viruses is low with the average value of GC contents being 50.5% and the highest value being 55.9%; the lowest value is 40.2%. ENC values of Flaviviridae virus genes vary from 48.75 to 57.83 with a mean value of 55.56. U-and A-ended codons are preferred in the Flaviviridae virus. Correlation analysis shows that the positive correlation between ENC value and GC content at the third nucleotide positions was significant in this family virus. The result of analysis of ENC, neutrality plot analysis, and correlation analysis revealed that codon usage bias of all the viruses was affected mainly by natural selection. Meanwhile, according to correspondence analysis (CoA) based on RSCU and phylogenetic analysis, the Flaviviridae viruses mainly are made up of two groups, Group I (Yellow fever virus, Apoi virus, Tembusu virus, Dengue virus 1, and others) and Group II (West Nile virus lineage 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, Usutu virus, Kedougou virus, and others). Conclusions. All in, the bias of codon usage pattern is affected not only by compositional constraints but also by natural selection. Phylogenetic analysis also illustrates that codon usage bias of virus can serve as an effective means of evolutionary classification in Flaviviridae virus.",

            "text": "All amino acids, except for methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp), are coded by more than one synonymous codon in the organism. The phenomenon that alternative synonymous codons do not occur equally is referred to as codon usage bias and this is a process of long-term accumulation. As an important evolutionary phenomenon, it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [1] . Compositional constraints and natural selection are thought to be two main factors influencing codon usage variation among the gene in different organisms [2, 3] . Flaviviridae viruses are singlestranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which threat human constantly mediated by mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies, such as Zika virus, Dengue virus, Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and other viruses. Because their hosts are from the vertebrates and invertebrate, most of Flaviviridae viruses are related to some human diseases. For example, Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus are mediated by mosquitoes. Dengue virus contains four serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) and its infection may cause symptoms from mild dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever, even dengue shock syndrome [4] and stabilizing selection acts on the codon usage bias [5] . Spread of the Japanese encephalitis virus, reported from WHO, produced a total of 27, 059 patients during 2006\u223c2009, out of which 86% were from China and India, 20\u223c30% were caused to be fatal and 30\u223c50% of the survivors were found to cause serious postinfection neurological sequelae and Japanese encephalitis virus has low codon usages bias influenced by both mutational pressure and natural selection [6] . Zika virus producing a number of microcephaly in Brazil is rapidly spreading to other parts of the world since 2015. Zika coding sequences have relatively conserved and genotype-specific evolution of codon usage bias [7] . Powassan virus, yellow fever virus, and spondweni virus are mediated by ticks. Powassan virus is a fatal, neurotropic virus, with a 671% 2 BioMed Research International rise in cases in the last 18 years, which has become an emerging danger worldwide [8] . Yellow fever virus can cause yellow fever which is endemic in many African and South American countries [9] . Spondweni virus can cause a selflimiting febrile illness characterized by headache, myalgia, nausea, and arthralgia similar to Zika virus infections [10] . Codon usage patterns of some members from the Flaviviridae viruses have been studied, such as Zika virus [7] and Dengue virus [5] . But the population codon usage characteristics of all Flaviviridae viruses have not been reported by now. Considering the recent increase in the prevalence of the family virus and its risk potential, we investigated the codon usage pattern to understand its evolutionary processes and provide some useful data to develop the medications for Flaviviridae viruses.",

ENC of 20 indicates that there is only one of the synonymous codons for each amino acid and the value of the 61 means that all corresponding amino acids are coded by all synonymous codons equally.

Further, for insight into its potential role on shaping the codon usage pattern, the base contents in the third position of Flaviviridae viruses were also calculated and A 3S %, U 3S %, G 3S %, C 3S %, and GC 3S % in these viruses were 33.11\u00b10.0405 (mean \u00b1 SD), 34.54\u00b10.0253, 27.01\u00b10.0104, 29.14\u00b10.0275, and 44.83\u00b10.0508, respectively. It is clear that U 3S % was distinctly high and G 3S % was the lowest when compared to other base contents in the third position ( Table 2) . The result of CAI shows that in relation to E.human, the CAI values of Flaviviridae virus range from 0.673 to 0.740, with an average value of 0.714 and a SD of 0.0163 (Table 1) .",

It indicated that codon usage bias in Flaviviridae viruses is a little low. To investigate the factors affecting Flaviviridae virus codon usage bias, the ENC values were plotted against the GC 3S values. In ENC versus GC 3S graph, the curve represents the expected values of ENC with the only factor of mutation and the points represent the actual values of ENC of coding sequences in the Flaviviridae viruses ( Figure 1 ). According to the ENC-GC 3S plots, all the viruses clustered together below the expected ENC curve, which indicated that in addition to mutation pressure, other factors, such as translational selection, also influence the codon usage pattern of Flaviviridae viruses coding sequences. [14] . another word, Flaviviridae viruses prefer A/U-ended codons ( Figure 2 ). We performed CoA on the RSCU values, which revealed that the first, second, third, and fourth axis accounted for 50.68%, 9.16%, 3.51%, and 1.63% of the total variation, respectively. Thus, the codon usage bias could be mainly explained by the first axis and second axis values which were plotted to understand the distribution of synonymous codons usage patterns. Each point represents a virus and the closer the points are, the more similar the patterns of the viruses are. As shown in Figure 3 , Flaviviridae viruses can be divided into two groups and the others, in which Group A includes Yellow fever virus, Apoi virus, Tembusu virus, Dengue virus 1, Wesselsbron virus and Group B includes West Nile virus ",

As ENC-GC 3 plots analysis shows, mutational pressure and other factors shaped the codon usage patterns of Flaviviridae viruses, which is similar to hepatitis C virus [22] . In fact, Hongju et al. have previously reported that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is weak and the influencing factors of the patterns are not only mutation pressure, but also translational selection, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity [14] . Although in previous studies [14, 23] on Zika virus, it is observed there were greater frequencies of A 3S /G 3S than U 3S . There were some viruses showing contrary characteristics; for example, Aedes flavivirus U 3S % was 0.2994 and G 3S % was 0.279; Alkhurma virus U 3S was % 0.3617 and G 3S % was 0.2773. By comprehensive analysis of all results, it can be found that overall U 3S % was more and G 3S % was lowest. Since Flaviviridae viruses prefer A/U-ended codons and A 3S % has a remarkable correlation with ENC (Table 3) , we think that compositional constraint shaping the synonymous codon bias was from the content of nucleotides A and U on the third codon position. This result was different from many reports in which compositional constraints influencing codon usage bias are from G and C contents (Zhou et al. 2004 ) [20, 24] . In addition, it can be found that the correlations of both Gravy values and Aroma values with ENC values are significant, which indicates the role of natural selection in shaping the codon usage patterns of the Flaviviridae viruses [6] . Besides, the codon usage patterns of this family were influenced by nature selection which dominates 93.8% and mutation pressure which dominates 6.2% (Figure 4) . In CoA-RSCU analysis, the Flaviviridae viruses can be divided into two groups and the others. The viruses which have similar codon usage patterns are clustered together. It is similar to the result from Neutrality plot analysis and the phylogenetic tree. All in, it is found that Yellow fever virus, Apoi virus, Tembusu virus, and Dengue virus 1 always clustered together.",
