If a subject was ill at one month of age the visit was postponed for approximately two weeks until the infant was again asymptomatic. The procedure of collecting nasal epithelial cell for transcriptomic analysis was modified previous published method 1 . Prior to brushing, the nasal cavity was washed with sterile non-bacteriostatic saline to remove any mucus, debris or intra-airway inflammatory cells, as previously described 2 . Immediately following, a nasal brush sample was obtained from the same nares using a sterile Copan flocked swab (FLOQSwabs, product #518C, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta CA) that was inserted completely into the anterior nares and rotated with an up and down circular motion for approximately 3-5 seconds to recover cells from the inferior turbinate. The swab was immediately placed in RNA stabilizer (RNAprotect, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and stored at 4\u00b0C. All subjects tolerated the procedures without difficulty. A second nasal swab was also collected from the contralateral nostril without washing for microbiomics analysis.",

We used a non-specific filtering strategy to remove genes with low expression values indistinguishable from background signal. We first computed i M , the 95% quantile for the ith gene expression among all subjects, for all genes. Next, we defined trimmed maximum log-expressions as 2 log ( 1) ii LM \uf03d\uf02b and pooled all i L s to form a density plot (Supplemental Figure 1 ). Two clusters of gene expression were identified; those with low expression (L i < 3.0 or M i <7.0) and those with higher expression (L i \u2265 3.0 or M i \u22657.0).

Totalnucleic acid was extracted using 200 \u00b5L of sample with the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit on a QIAcube (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with a final elution volume of 75 \u00b5L. Recombinant RNasin\u00ae Ribonuclease Inhibitor (2 \u00b5L, Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each nucleic acid sample.TaqMan\u00ae Array Card (TAC) technology was used on the ViiA7 instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to perform real time PCR (rPCR) in a non-multiplexed format. The 384 well micro-fluidic card (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was preloaded with primer and probe sets to detect 23 viral and bacterial pathogens plus internal controls in duplicate as previously described8,9 , with primer and probe modifications as outlined in SupplementalTable 2.Viral targets included influenzaA and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus 1 through 4, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus (hBoV), and parechovirus. The card also detects H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, M. hominis, Ureaplasma, and B. pertussis. Seven samples and one no-template control were assayed per card using 20 \u00b5L of sample with AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The thermocycling conditions were 45\u00b0C for 10 minutes, 94\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds followed by 60\u00b0C for 1 minute. A sample was considered positive for a pathogen when the duplicate wells registered a rPCR curve crossing the threshold. Discrepant results were confirmed in individual rPCR assays performed in a 96 well format on a Life Technologies 7500 real time PCR system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The presence of Moraxella cataarrhalis was assessed separately by real-time PCR essentially as described, with minor modifications 5,10 . Primer and probe sequences were similar to these prior studies (300 nM; 5'-GTGAGTGCCGCTTTACAACC-3', 5'-TGTATCGCCTGCCAAGACAA-3'), with the exception that the probe was labeled with FAM (200nM; 5'FAM-TGCTTTTGCAGCTGTTAGCCAGCCTAA-BHQ1).

The red line represents the defined detection level (c=3.0 for L i , or 7.0 for M i ) used in non-specific filtering. Among the 25,237 genes assessed, 13,978 genes passed this non-specific filtering threshold and were considered expressed in the HINT. Supplemental Figure 2. Pathway analysis of genes with highest variation in the HINT. Pathway analysis was performed for the 200 genes identified as having the highest coefficient of variation in expression (see Methods) in the HINT, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, as described in Methods. Shown here are significantly affected canonical pathways, listing the percentage of virus-associated genes (blue bar) and the percentage of all genes in the genome that correspond to each listed pathway (red bar). The pathways are ranked by p-value (p<0.05), with the most significant at the top. Supplemental Figure 3. Pathway analysis of genes associated with the presence of pathogenic virus. Pathway analysis was performed for the 282 genes identified as having significant differences in mean expression in subjects with the presence of any virus, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, as described in Methods.
