Their secondary structures are crucial for the RNA functionality, and the prediction of the secondary structures is widely studied. Our previous research shows that cutting long sequences into shorter chunks, predicting secondary structures of the chunks independently using thermodynamic methods, and reconstructing the entire secondary structure from the predicted chunk structures can yield better accuracy than predicting the secondary structure using the RNA sequence as a whole. The chunking, prediction, and reconstruction processes can use different methods and parameters, some of which produce more accurate predictions than others. In this paper, we study the prediction accuracy and efficiency of three different chunking methods using seven popular secondary structure prediction programs that apply to two datasets of RNA with known secondary structures, which include both pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted sequences, as well as a family of viral genome RNAs whose structures have not been predicted before. Our modularized MapReduce framework based on Hadoop allows us to study the problem in a parallel and robust environment.",

We observe similar results for the 23 pseudoknotted sequences, except for the NUPACK program using the centered chunking method. The performance analysis for 14 long RNA sequences from the Nodaviridae virus family outlines how the coarse-grained mapping of chunking and predictions in the MapReduce framework exhibits shorter turnaround times for short RNA sequences. However, as the lengths of the RNA sequences increase, the fine-grained mapping can surpass the coarse-grained mapping in performance.",

A sequence of these bases is strung together to form a single-stranded RNA molecule. RNA plays important roles in many biological processes including gene expression and regulation. RNA molecules vary greatly in size, ranging from nineteen nucleotide bases in microRNAs [1] to long polymers of over 30,000 bases in complete viral genomes [2] . Although an RNA molecule is a linear polymer, it tends to fold back on itself to form a 3-dimensional (3D) functional structure, mostly by pairing complementary bases. Among the four nucleotide bases, C and G form complementary base pairs by hydrogen bonding, as do A and U; in RNA (but not DNA), G can also base pair with U residues. The overall stability of an RNA structure element is determined by the \"minimal free energy\" defined as the amount of energy it would take to completely unpair all of the base pairs that hold it together (e.g., by denaturing it with heat).",

Searching for a structure with global minimal free energy may be memory and time intensive, especially for long sequences with pseudoknots. To overcome the tremendous demand on computing resources, various alternative algorithms have been proposed that restrict the types of pseudoknots for possible prediction in order to keep computation time and storage size under control. Yet, most programs available to date for pseudoknot structure prediction can only process sequences of limited lengths on the order of several hundred nucleotides. These programs, therefore, cannot be applied directly to larger RNA molecules such as the genomic RNA in viruses, which may be thousands of bases in length. At the same time, minimal energy configurations may not be the most favorable structures for carrying out the biological functions of RNA, which often require the RNA to react and bind with other molecules (e.g., RNA binding proteins). Our current work suggests that local structures formed by pairings among nucleotides in close proximity and based on local minimal free energies rather than the global minimal free energy, may better correlate with the real molecular structure of long RNA sequences. This hypothesis has yet to be supported by more detailed experimental evidence. If proven correct, our approach will open the door to a new generation of programs based on segmenting long RNA sequences into shorter chunks, predicting the secondary structures of each chunk individually, and then assembling the prediction results to give the structure of the original sequence.",

We used this approach on the genome sequences of the virus family Nodaviridae, leading to the discovery of secondary structures essential for RNA replication of the Nodamura virus [11] . However, the study also identified the necessity of having a more effective segmentation strategy for cutting the sequence so that the predicted results of the chunks can be assembled to generate a reasonably accurate structure for the original molecule. Indeed, the selection of cutting points in the original RNA sequence is a crucial component of the segmenting step. In this paper, we propose to approach the problem by identifying inversion excursions in the RNA sequence and cutting around them. We consider two alternative inversion-based segmentation strategies: the centered and optimized chunking methods. Both methods identify regions in the sequence with high concentrations of inversions and avoid cutting into these regions. In the centered method, the longest spanning inversion clusters are centered in the chunks, while in the optimized method, the number of bases covered by inversions is maximized. Preliminary results have been presented in the authors' work [12, 13] .",

In this paradigm, the programmer specifies two functions: map and reduce.

The runtime system automatically groups all the values associated with the same key and forms the input to the reduce function. The reduce function takes as input a key and values pair \u2329k 2 , list(v 2 )\u232a, performs the reduce function, and outputs a list of values -i.e., Reduce \u2329k 2 , list(v 2 )\u232a list \u2329v 3 \u232a.

As the cutting process can be performed in different ways, the search for effective ways to cut sequences can require a large search space and generate a large number of independent prediction jobs that can potentially be performed in parallel. The workflow for a parallel chunk-based RNA secondary structure prediction and accuracy assessment consists of the following four steps: (1) chunking: each RNA sequence is cut into multiple chunks (or segments) according to various chunking algorithms and parameters; (2) prediction: the secondary structure for each chunk is predicted independently by using one or more prediction programs; (3) reconstruction: the whole secondary structure of a sequence is reconstructed from predicted structures, one for each chunk; and (4) analysis: reconstructed structures are compared against known structures to assess prediction accuracies. Figure 3 .a shows the prediction workflow. Note that the chunks do not necessarily have the same length: the lengths depend on the chunking method and parameters used. Also note that the chunk's prediction time and memory usage can vary based on the number of nucleotides in the chunk and the prediction program used. In most prediction programs the time and memory used do not grow linearly but exponentially with the number of nucleotides, with the exponential factor depending on the program complexity and its capability to capture complex RNA secondary structures such as pseudoknots.",

In many bioinformatics applications, the problem calls for identifying high concentration regions of a certain property in the nucleotide bases of biomolecular sequences. For example, replication origins in viral genomes have been predicted by looking for regions that are unusually rich in the nucleotides A and T in DNA sequences [20] . In this paper, we follow the same approach for RNA sequences, but our focus is whether or not the nucleotide base is found inside an inversion. We refer to the excursions generated by this property as \"inversion excursions.\" The excursion method requires assigning a positive score to each nucleotide if it is a part of an inversion (including the two stems and the gap between them), and a negative score if it does not. We go through the entire nucleotide sequence accumulating the scores to form inversion excursions.",

As shown in Figure 7 , the sequence is segmented into six chunks using the centered chunking method. These six segments cover the entire sequence. Labels 1 through 6 in Figure 7 represent the six segments with decreasing order of peak excursion scores. After the peak scores are sorted, the peak with the highest excursion score is considered first. In this example, we use the maximum chunk-length c = 100. The highest peak is found at Position 297 with peak bottom at 257. As there are other inversions after the highest scoring peak, we follow the entire excursion to the end at Position 356. After locating the last peak in this excursion at 343, we center the sequence segment from 257 to 343 to produce the chunk covering the 100 positions from 250 to 349, then the second highest scoring peak at Position 54 is considered and the above procedure is repeated. This time, the peak bottom is at Position 19 and the last peak before the end of this excursion is at Position 70. Centering the segment consisting of Positions 19 -70 in a chunk of 100 would require 24 positions on each side, extending the chunk beyond the beginning of Figure 5 Peaks, peak bottoms, and peak lengths.

Centered chunking method where x = peak length. We take the sequence segment between the peak bottom and the position of the very last peak in the excursion, and place the sequence segment in the center of the chunk. the sequence; we therefore adjust the chunk to start at Position 1 instead. Note that during the segmentation process, we might get a chunk that overlaps with previously established chunks. In those cases, we have to reconcile the situation by reducing one of the chunk lengths. For example, after establishing the first two chunks (labels 1 and 2 in Figure 7 ), the next highest peak to be processed is at Position 114, with peak bottom at Position 89. Centering this peak produces a chunk from Positions 52 to 151, overlapping with Chunk 2. We resolve such conflicts by giving priority to the chunk with the higher number of bases within completely contained inversions. With this rule, we give priority to Chunk 2, and reduce Chunk 3 to Positions 101 -151. The process continues for the remaining Chunks 4 -6.",

            "text": "Given an RNA sequence, the search for the best set of chunking parameters (i.e., maximum chunk length c, chunking method, minimum stem length L, and maximum gap length G) requires us to traverse or search a multilevel tree (i.e. the chunking tree in Figure 3 .b). In the chunking tree, each path from the root (RNA sequence) to the leaves (RNA chunks) represents a set of parameter values of the chunking method (i.e., c, L, and G). The overall workflow (including the chunking, prediction, reconstruction, and analysis steps) naturally adapts to fit into the MapReduce (MR) paradigm and can be easily implemented with Hadoop for which the chunking and predictions can be solved by multiple mappers while the reconstruction and the analysis are done by a single reducer. In our framework, each MR job is designed to partially traverse the multi-level tree. Multiple MR jobs can be executed in parallel to explore the whole tree. The multiple searching paths combine attributes of both breadth-first search (performed by multiple MR jobs in parallel) and depth-first search (performed by a single MR job). While traversing the tree with multiple MR jobs, we can explore the impact of different chunking methods as well as different c, L and G values for a given sequence. An example of an MR job is shown in the circled part of Figure 3 .b, for which we assume the centered chunking method, with fixed c = 60 bases, and we vary L and G between 3 and 8 and between 0 and 8 respectively. As previously outlined, for a sequence and a combination of parameters, the mappers perform the chunking and predictions. The input to each mapper is a \u2329k 1 , v 1 \u232a value pair, in which k 1 is the ID of the sequence, and v 1 is the chunking parameters' values (including the chunking method). Each mapper cuts the sequence according to the chunking parameters values in the chunking step by identifying a variable number of chunks meeting the parameter requirements. Note that each combination of parameters (each branch of the tree) can result in a variable number of chunks. Each mapper performs the prediction on one or more chunks using a certain prediction program. Here we use five secondary structure prediction programs capable of predicting pseudoknots (IPknot [24] , pknotsRG [25] , HotKnots [3] , NUPACK [26] , and PKNOTS [8] ) and two programs that do not include this capability (i.e., UNAFOLD [27] and RNAfold [28] ). Other programs can be easily used in our framework as a plug-and-play software module. After the prediction, each mapper outputs the list of \u2329k 2 , v 2 \u232a pairs as the intermediate output to reduce. The k 2 is the ID of the whole secondary structure to which the predicted chunk belongs and v 2 is the predicted secondary structure of the chunk. After the Hadoop runtime system groups all the values associated with the same key and passes the \u2329k 2 , list (v 2 )\u232a to the reducer, the reducer reconstructs the whole Figure 11 RF00209_A sequence and secondary structure. RF00209_A sequence and its experimental secondary structure from RFAM database. In the bracket view representation, bases that are hydrogen bonded with other bases are represented by a \"(\" or a \")\" and a matching pair of \"(\" and \")\" indicates that the bases at those positions are paired to be part of a secondary structure. Unpaired nucleotide bases are represented by a \":\" (colon). secondary structure of the sequence using all the v 2 (predicted chunk structures) associated with the same k 2 . If required, the reducer analyzes the results in terms of their accuracy. After the accuracy has been computed, the reducer outputs the final results as a list(v 3 ), in which v 3 is the AR for reconstructed structures.",

In our framework, each mapper runs the chunking process on an RNA sequence with a given set of parameter values and then predicts one or multiple chunks. The granularity of the mapping can vary based on the number of chunks each mapper is assigned to predict. Our MR framework includes both a coarse-grained mapping and a fine-grained mapping as shown in Figure 12 , in which each box represents a mapper. With the coarsegrained mapping, each mapper explores one branch of the chunking tree: it cuts the sequence into a set of segments based on a combination of L and G values and predicts all the segments it generates locally in order. With the finegrained mapping, multiple mappers explore one branch of the chunking tree: each mapper cuts the same sequence into the same set of segments, but this time it predicts only one chunk that it generates. This means that if, for example, the sequence is cut into five segments, then there will be five mappers exploring the same branch of the chunking tree, replicating the chunking process but predicting only one distinguished segment of the five chunks available. The mappers determine which segment to predict based on a hash function; thus the mappers do not need to synchronize their work or directly agree on what chunk to predict. The hash function uses the ASCII value of the chunk identifier as the key and the identifier of each mapper as the value. The function selects the segments to mappers in a round robin fashion.",

Likewise, the AW value is the percentage of agreement between the known structure and the predicted structure when the whole sequence is used. These values indicate how closely the predicted structure resembles the real structure. A larger AC value means that the chunk-based predicted structure is more similar to the real structure. For a given dataset, prediction program, and chunking method, our MR framework collects multiple predicted structures associated with different c, L, and G parameters. The MAC value for a sequence is the maximum AC value, which gives the highest accuracy that can be attained for that sequence by the chunking method and the specific prediction program employed. In Figures 13.d and 14 .d, the AW of the sequences in the two datasets are presented respectively. From these figures, it appears that most of the prediction methods have similar accuracy ranges regardless of the chunking method used and whether the prediction was obtained with the whole sequence or with the chunks; however, the PKNOTS program produces somewhat lower accuracies. This lower accuracy is quite expected because PKNOTS is actually the earliest algorithm allowing for pseudoknot prediction. The other prediction programs with pseudoknot prediction capability that have developed afterwards have incorporated improvements over the original PKNOTS.",

We have been conducting studies to identify how the prediction accuracy correlates with these parameters. Some of the results have been reported in preliminary work of the group [12, 13] . So far we have not found any definitive criteria that work for all sequences in general. Rather, the nucleotide base composition and length of the individual sequence, as well as the sequence length limitations imposed by the particular prediction program, need to be taken into account. Second, the fact that segmentation can in many cases improve the prediction accuracy for an RNA sequence is somewhat counterintuitive. One possible explanation is that secondary structure prediction algorithms are generally based on global minimal free energy, resulting in the most thermodynamically stable isoforms. However, these structures may not be most favorable for biological functions, which often require RNAs to interact with other molecules or unfold during replication. Our results suggest that local structures formed by pairings of bases in close proximity, rather than the global energies, may better correlate with the real structures of large RNA molecules.

In each subfigure there are three groups of times, one for each maximum chunk length. Each group lists the 14 sequences sorted based on their length in nucleotide bases. More specifically, Figure 17 .a presents the times and number of map tasks when the coarse-grained MR implementation and the centered method are used; Figure 17 .b presents the times and number of map tasks when the coarse-grained MR implementation and the optimized method are used; Figure 17 .c presents the times and number of map tasks when the fine-grained MR implementation and the centered method are used; and Figure 17 .d presents the times and number of map tasks when the fine-grained MR implementation and the optimized method are used. As already presented above, when using coarse-grained mapping, each mapper performs the chunking for the assigned sequence using a set of parameter values for the max length of stems (L) and gap sizes (G). The mapper then predicts the secondary structures of all its local chunks. This results in the exploration of a whole branch of the tree by the mapper. The total number of branches (and map tasks) is given by the combinations of L and G values (i.e., 54). When using fine-grained mapping, chunking of a sequence based on a set of L and G values is performed across mappers and mappers are assigned resulting chunks in a round-robin fashion. Computationally this is performed by replicating the chunking processes across mappers and by using a hash function to assign different chunks to different mappers. The number of chunks equals the number of map tasks and depends on the number of inversions identified in the chunking process.",

Table 6 quantifies the similarity for both subgroups (i.e. RNA2 and RNA1) which is within 3%. This observation is different from the previous work in which the centered method resulted in shorter execution times due to the fact that a different implementation of the chunking methods and a different program were used. When comparing centered vs. optimized chunking methods for the fine-grained mapping, the optimized method results in a slightly lower execution time. As shown in Table 7 , the execution times of fine-grained mapping when using the optimized chunking method for both subgroups (RNA2 and RNA1) is 11% to 18% slower than using the centered method. Table 8 shows the average number of chunks (i.e., map tasks) for both subgroups using centered and optimized methods. We can see that the optimized method results in 10% to 19% less chunks. The optimized method tends to cut sequences into fewer chunks, which leads to fewer map tasks and shorter MapReduce total times. This observation is different from the previous work in which the centered method results in shorter execution times due to the same reason we mentioned above [17] .",

            "text": "When decoupling the total time in its components, we observe that the time components for the reduce function and shuffling are very marginal compared to the times used for the mapping functions (around 1% of the total time). We also observe that, as we explore a prediction tree, some mappers are performing more work than others, resulting in idle time and low efficiency. The load imbalance among mappers depends on the granularity and chunking methods used. To better understand the causes of load imbalance we cut down the mapping times into compute time (i.e., chunking and predictions) and idle time (i.e., waiting for all the mappers to complete their predictions). Figure 19 shows the percentage of compute and idle times in map function for coarse-grained mapping vs. fine-grained mapping as well as for centered vs. optimized methods. More specifically, Figures 19.a and Average total times for the seven sequences in RNA2 and in RNA1 for coarse-grained mapping using centered and optimized methods. Figure 19 shows how fine-grained mapping reaches better efficiency compared to coarse-grained mapping. In other words, with fine-grained mapping, the mappers spend more time doing real chunking and predictions. We observe in Figure 17 (left y-axes) how fine-grained mapping has a larger number of map tasks and each map task is shorter (it predicts only one chunk) making easier for the Hadoop scheduler to allocate the several tasks efficiently by using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) policy. On the other hand, coarse-grained mapping has a smaller number of map tasks and each map task is longer (all the sequence chunks of a given L and G combination are predicted by a single mapper). In this case, once the scheduler assigns a longer task to a mapper, it has to wait for its completion, even if the other mappers have generated their chunk predictions, before proceeding to the reduce phase. We also observe that as the maximum chunk length increases from 60 to 300 bases, the map efficiency tends to drop. More specifically, the average map efficiency for coarse-grained mapping decreases from 36% to 25% on RNA2 and from 18% to 15% on RNA1 when using centered or optimized chunking methods. The average map efficiency for fine-grained mapping decreases from 91% to 79% on RNA2 and from 97% to 93% on RNA1. This is due to the fact that the centered and optimized chunking methods tend to produce more chunks with shorter chunk lengths when using a maximum chunk length of 60. On the other hand, when using a maximum chunk 300, the same methods tend to produce fewer chunks each with longer lengths.",

To study this phenomenon, we consider the Nodamura virus (NoV) RNA2 sequence which shows the largest drop in efficiency when moving from 60 to 300 max chunk lengths, as shown in Figure 19 . Figures 20 and  21 show the number of chunks and their lengths (i.e., max, min and median) for the different L and G parameter combinations with centered and optimized methods when the maximum chunk length is equal to 60 ( Figure 20) and when the length is equal to 300 ( Figure 21 ).

At the same time the length of each set of chunks increases as well as the length variability within the set of chunks for a defined combination of L and G values. Note that for some combinations of L and G, the chunking process does not identify any set of chunks and we do not report any result for these cases. This confirms our observation that as the number of chunks decreases, the chunk lengths increase but not homogeneously within a prediction, causing load imbalance and loss in efficiency. Selecting the shorter maximum length for the sake of efficiency is not always a wise decision: a maximum chunk length of 60 bases may be too short for the type of RNA sequences we are considering. In Figure 20 , the median is very close to the maximum length of 60 for the centered methods, indicating that we are cutting out valuable parts of the inversion and ultimately of the secondary structures we are predicting.",

Furthermore, the chunk-based predictions can, on average, attain accuracies even higher than those obtained from predictions using the whole sequence.
