However, the effects of DOX, which is widely used in porcine husbandry by feed, on the porcine intestinal epithelium are unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that DOX damaged mitochondrial morphology and induced the co-localization of mitochondria with autophagosomes, suggesting that DOX induces mitophagy in IPEC-J2 cells. We also found evidence that DOX increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial-specific ROS in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, 50 \u00b5g/ml DOX significantly decreased production of interferon-\u03b2 and facilitated replication of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus in IPEC-J2 cells. These results demonstrated that DOX induced mitophagy and ROS production, which damaged the intestinal epithelium. As DOX is used extensively in pig husbandry, uncontrolled application poses a significant threat of viral infection, so stricter policies on its usage should be required.",

Depending on the types and sizes of animals and the type of antibiotic, the dose of antibiotic varies from 3.0 to 220.0 g/kg of feed (McEwen and Fedorka-Cray, 2002) . Doxycycline (DOX) is a second-generation tetracycline derivative used widely in pig husbandry (Zhang et al., 2015) . It is reported that the concentration of DOX in swine manure that collected from different developing phases of livestock in 4 typical farms of Tianjin, China, were in the range of 8.6-59.8 mg/kg (Xian-Gang et al., 2008) . In fact, very high concentration of veterinary antibiotics (up to hundreds of mg/kg) have frequently been found in animal excreta in China (Chen et al., 2012) . According to the drug specifications of commercial doxycycline, the recommended usage does of DOX is in the range of 100-200 mg/kg of feed or water in China. It occupies the A-site of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocks recruitment of aminoacyl-tRNA into the bacterial ribosome, which inhibits protein synthesis (Chopra, 1994) . Given the proteobacterial origin of mitochondria, DOX also has powerful inhibitory effects on mitochondrial ribosomes and protein synthesis . This antibiotic can destroy mitochondrial dynamics and promotes the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in cells (Moullan et al., 2015) .",

We first found that DOX induced mitophagy rather than apoptosis in this cell line. Moreover, DOX decreased IFN-\u03b2 production in IPEC-J2 cells transfected with poly (I: C).

Antibiotics that induce mitochondrial dysfunction could cause oxidative damage in mammalian cells (Kalghatgi et al., 2013) . DOX also affects mitochondrial morphology in cultured cells (Moullan et al., 2015) . We tested whether DOX induces production of intracellular ROS in IPEC-J2 cells. DCF fluorescence intensity, which indicates the intracellular level of ROS, increased significantly after a 24-h incubation with the positive control rotenone or DOX at all concentrations examined (Figure 2A) . The mitochondrial-specific ROS indicator MitoSox, which could selectively detects superoxide in mitochondria, was used to examine mitochondrial ROS levels. Once oxidized by superoxide, mitochondrial-targeted MitoSox generates red fluorescence. MitoSox fluorescence was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2B) . We also measured the mRNA levels of Nrf2 and superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, which are involved in modulating ROS levels, to further examine oxidative stress status. According to the results, their expression were increased in a dose-dependent manner after a 24-h exposure to DOX (Figures 2C,D) . We speculated that DOX could lead to the accumulation of ROS and damaged mitochondria. The mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by Rh123, but no changes were detected ( Figure 2E) . We then used two types of mitochondrialspecific label to distinguish respiring (MitoTracker Red) vs. total (MitoTracker Green) mitochondria. Dysfunctional non-respiring (MitoTracker green-positive, MitoTracker rednegative) mitochondria increased dramatically after DOX treatment (Figures 2F,G) . DOX could induce oxidative stress and increase the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in IPEC-J2 cells.",

            "text": "Based on the evidence that autophagy protects cells from apoptosis and the so-called apoptosis/autophagy paradox hypothesis (Gonz\u00e1lez-Polo et al., 2005; Fimia and Piacentini, 2010) , we determined whether DOX induces autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells. LC3 is a labeling protein found on the autophagosome membrane. Newly synthesized LC3 is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. However, LC3I is transformed into LC3II when autophagy occurs, and the latter accumulates on autophagosome membranes. Therefore, the degree of autophagy can be determined by the LC3II: LC3I ratio (Tanida et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2013) . Thus, we examined expression of the LC3 autophagosome protein in IPEC-J2 cells by Western blot analysis. The LC3II: LC3I ratio increased in a dose-dependent manner during a 24-h incubation with DOX compared with the control; the exception was the 1 \u00b5g/ml DOX group, in which the LC3II: LC3I ratio increased only slightly (Figures 3A,B) . To this end, we used CCCP and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) (Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2009) as a positive-control group. Moreover, we established stable IPEC-J2 cells that expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion protein. DOX treatment led to the punta formation in GFP-LC3-labeled vesicles. In contrast, most cells in the control group displayed a weak and diffuse cytoplasmic GFP-LC3 fusion protein signal ( Figure 3C ). The number of GFP-LC3B puncta per cell is shown in Figure 3D . An increase in LC3II or GFP-LC3 vesicles can occur due to increased synthesis of autophagosomes and due to impaired autophagosomelysosome fusion. Therefore, a simple assessment of LC3II levels or LC3-positive vesicles cannot distinguish between the two scenarios. Thus, we used the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter construct to measure autophagic flux (Kimura et al., 2007) . The green fluorescence of this tandem autophagosome reporter is attenuated in the acidic pH of the lysosome by lysosomal hydrolysis, whereas red fluorescence is not. Therefore, autophagosomes have both GFP and mRFP signals, whereas autolysosomes have only mRFP signals, because GFP is attenuated in the acidic lysosomal environment. RFP-LC3-labeled puncta structures FIGURE 3 | DOX induces complete autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells.

We used TEM to observe whether DOX induced mitochondrial and autophagosome damage. As shown in Figure 4A , oval mitochondria in the control group had the complete crista structure. However, mitochondria became swollen and had few cristae in IPEC-J2 cells after a 24-h incubation with DOX. Double-membrane vesicles enclosing the mitochondria were also observed. Dysfunctional mitochondria number was shown ( Figure 4B) . We speculated that this structural change was caused by mitophagy. It has been reported that mitophagy clears the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which is important for mitochondrial turnover (Hara et al., 2014) . For further evidence, we constructed the multi-functional pLVX-EGFP-LC3B-IRES-mito-mCherry lentiviral vector and transfected it into IPEC-J2 cells to detect mitophagy induced FIGURE 4 | DOX induces complete mitophagy.

Obvious GFP-LC3B and mito-mCherry were clearly co-localized in IPEC-J2 cells after a 24-h DOX treatment at all concentrations examined ( Figure 4C) . However, the complete of mitophagic flux was unknown. For this reason, we used a sensitive dual-fluorescence reporter expressing mRFP-GFPmito fused in-frame to a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Bcl-xL transmembrane structure) to monitor mitophagy and lysosomes for degradation. Many bright red color-labeled mitochondria were present as puncta after different incubation durations with DOX ( Figure 4D) . In contrast, treatment with CQ restored the expression of green fluorescence and resulted in yellow color-labeled mito in CCCP-or DOX-treated cells ( Figure 4D ).",

We observed a high dose of DOX enhanced cell viability, it might be due to that mitochondrial mass could affect the result of MTT assay (Gerlier and Thomasset, 1986) . DOX inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, increases the level of ROS, and reduces ATP synthesis through its mitochondrial actions (Kalghatgi et al., 2013) . Our results show that DOX increased the level of ROS or mitoROS in a dose dependent manner and induced oxidative stress in IPEC-J2 cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential of IPEC-J2 cells was not affected by DOX (Figure 2) , albeit three studies have reported that DOX decreases mitochondrial membrane potential (Sourdeval et al., 2006) . DOX provides a balance between mitochondrial fission and the accumulation of fragmented mitochondria (Moullan et al., 2015) . The number of dysfunctional mitochondria increased significantly in IPEC-J2 cells after DOX incubation (Figure 2) . We can observe that the number of dysfunctional mitochondria for both 1 and 100 ug/ml of DOX is similar. It might be due to the fact that 100 ug/ml DOX can induce significantly mitophagy to maintain relative mitochondrial dynamics by removing damaged mitochondria. A review reported that six of seven studies support the apoptotic action of DOX, whereas one study showed an anti-apoptotic effect (Sagar et al., 2010) .

Replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases in response to Parkin-mediated mitophagy (Kim et al., 2013a) , and HBV favors its own replication by promoting bulk autophagy (Tang et al., 2009; Sir et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011) . The late stages of mitophagy must be completed to attenuate RLR signaling . Our data suggest that DOX decreased IFN-\u03b2 production in IPEC-J2 cells transfected with poly (I: C) (Figure 5) . As a result, DOX promoted replication of TGEV, which is a single-stranded RNA virus (Figure 6) . We also provide evidence for the effects of DOX on IPEC-J2 cells. DOX induced mitophagy to mitigate the antiviral innate immune response, which might contribute to the replication of TGEV in intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest caution to prevent the abuse of DOX in pig husbandry.",
