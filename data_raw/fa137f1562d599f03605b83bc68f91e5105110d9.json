Look in any leading biomedical journal and the at- What do we mean by a moving target? The molecule aimed at with a drug may move location, from organ to organ or be transported within the body so that delivery of the drug is crucially important. The molecule may be present at a higher expression rate in some individuals or as a result of disease. In others it may be absent as a consequence of genetic differences such as single nucleotide polymorphisms so that the tested drug has no effect. As a corollary, the target itself may not move, but the treated organism can modify the drug, for instance by degrading the drug, meaning the \"bullet\" loses momentum and barely reaches the target. In addition, transport proteins (eg P-glycoprotein) are expressed which carry the drug back outside the targeted cells. With some drugs, the effects observed may be unrelated to the target at which it is aimed, because unbeknown to the medical \"hunter\", the \"shot\" has been sliced and a totally unexpected target has been hit, leading to so-called \"off-target effects\". All these off-target changes have a marked effect on the precision of the pharmaceutical bullet, since the reproducibility of the treatment is considerably reduced. 3, 4 Alternatively, the target molecule can transform, not just in an oncological sense. It may occur in different isoforms or conformations, be changed or differentially expressed in response to cell stimuli or pathophysiological processes and can be modified over time in culture, with the time of day or as a result of aging.",

Adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, particularly on the gastrointestinal system are pronounced, but more sinister long-term genetic effects can arise. For instance, treatment of mice with the chemotherapeutic agents, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C, or procarbazine caused apparent genome-wide instability with significant elevation of simple tandem repeat mutation frequencies in the sperm and bone marrow of their offspring. 28 Thus, intergenerational effects of anticancer therapy may potentially place the children of treated parents at risk, suggesting that a warning of potential effects on offspring should be given to patients of childbearing age to be treated with chemotherapy. As with infectious diseases, the collateral damage caused by nonspecific cytostatic therapy could well be a health threat to future generations and highly specific multi-targeting could well be a better option. In fact, the most recent informationbased research suggests that a variety of different tumor types exhibit a recurrent regulatory structure consisting of functional master regulator proteins which are dysregulated in a posttranslational manner. 29 Multiple targeting of this network of master regulator proteins, potentially starting also with screens in vitro, may be a way ahead for cancer therapy.",

Moreover, in addition to histones, other proteins that are subject to acetylation might also be affected by HDAC activity. Interestingly, it appears that concomitant inhibition of cancer-associated inflammation with an inhibitor of the transcription factor, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), may act synergistically with HDAC inhibitors and reduce side-effects-a further indication of the potential benefit of combined drug therapy of disease. 43 Often the epigenetic modifications seen in healthy and transformed cells are studied experimentally only for a few hours or days.",

But other types of drugs, including analgesics, are able to modify epigenetic markers such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation. 46, 47 Thus, the post-translational silencing or activation of genes may be continued to subsequent generations. In this respect, a warning note is raised by the finding discussed earlier that treatment of male mice with standard chemotherapeutic drugs results in transgenerational instability in their offspring. 28 Variability in natural populations is often driven by environmental or infection induced posttranslational genetic modifications and it is highly probable that drug treatment may need to be included among the modifying factors. 48 ",

Consequently, the immune system begins to recognize antigenic molecules beyond those of the specific, external chemical determinants to which a specific immune response was initially induced. 52 Not only does this lead to autoimmune tissue damage but also to the recruitment of a variety of different humoral, cytotoxic, and immunoregulatory mechanisms. At a later stage of many chronic autoimmune diseases it is, therefore, difficult to determine the basic underlying defect.",

But epitope drift can also complicate the use of experimental models of autoimmunity. One of us (MJP) well remembers performing a series of studies years ago on the tissue injuring effects of lymph node lymphocytes from Lewis and Wistar rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, 54, 55 during which the reactivity of the lymphocytes was gradually lost with time, presumably due to epitope drift, and the project had to be stopped. These observations are supported by results of a study by other authors on adjuvant arthritis induced in Sprague Dawley rats from two different vendors. 56 The rats from the two sources varied in their susceptibility to arthritis, as well as in immune (various proinflammatory cytokines) and endocrine (plasma ACTH and corticosterone) responses. The authors suggested that different types of genetic drift in the two colonies were probably responsible, a possibility raised in a previous publication. 57 It would be well worthwhile to carry out a comparative study between different labs of the range of antigenic reactivity of lymphocytes from animals in which the same initial stimulus is used to induce the autoimmune response. One would guess that this reactivity would differ considerably, indicating that the researchers are not necessarily assessing the same response. supplements to strengthen the immune response. There is also increasing evidence that probiotics such as Lactobacillus can not only modify the constitution of the gut microbiome but also promote innate immunity. In this way, they also indirectly enhance adaptive immunity. [63] [64] [65] Even in laboratory animals, though, dietary changes can occur unexpectedly. In one study in which one of us (MJP) was involved, eicosanoid metabolites, including PGE2, were determined over a period of several years in platelets and inflammatory exudates from different experiments on laboratory rats fed an essential fatty acid deficient diet. With time, the quantities of eicosanoids generated enigmatically increased. 66 The source was eventually found to be an unannounced change made by the diet manufacturer in the source of the oil used to ensure essential fatty acid deficiency.",

For instance, sex hormones affect not only the pH and motility of the gastric intestinal tract, but also the expression of oxidative metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporter proteins. 118 Nevertheless, in the rat 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)induced colitis model, sulfasalazine itself is able to restore the TNBS-induced gut dysbiosis, as reflected by increasing counts of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing and lactic acid-producing bacteria, as well as decreasing counts of proteobacteria, thereby ameliorating colitis. 123 Enhancement of SCFA production by gut bacteria is also thought to be one of the mechanisms by which the anti-diabetic type 2 drug, metformin, modifies glucose metabolism and cardiovascular responses. 124 Thus, changes in the gut microbiome, caused by diet or lifestyle differences, can potentially alter the metabolism and thereby the efficacy of drugs, even in similar strains of rodents, since as we discussed previously, animals from different suppliers can differ in responses to xenobiotics. 56 Indeed, an extensive sequence analysis of the gut microbiome in three different mouse strains from two suppliers, revealed considerable differences in bacterial composition between the same strains from different suppliers. 125 Polymorphisms in drug transporter proteins are a more subtle source of concern, since these differences affect not only metabolic behavior of drugs but also their specific distribution to organs, tissues, and cells. On the one hand, efflux transport of drugs out of tumors and bacteria is a major reason for drug resistance, 126, 127 necessitating continual development of new approaches to cancer and infections, preferably using the multitarget approach to minimize the potential for resistance. 126, 127 On the other hand, while differences in drug transporters are known to affect hepatic transport and kidney excretion of drugs, it is also worthwhile noting that these transporter proteins can also affect drug transport into other tissues and organs. For instance, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATPs) regulate intestinal absorption of macrolide antibiotics. 128 OATP 1A2 is most highly expressed in the brain and appears to regulate drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. 129 ",

The growth of a dysregulated cancer or other cell could be slowed so that more time is available to target a more specific mechanism. In this way, the serial use of two to three pharmacological agents, preferably with long drug-target residence times, would probably have greater efficacy than a single potent agent that only proves to be effective in a limited number of patients because of the inherent instability of the target mechanism. This approach is already taken to good effect in the treatment of hypertension in which a diuretic, for instance, is combined with a sartan and/ or a calcium antagonist to consistently decrease blood pressure. 137 We emphasize four already existing approaches (Figure 4 ) that can be taken either singly or in combination, to try to minimize effects of pharmacological plasticity: 145 The challenge is to identify, possibly by reverse pharmacology through extrapolation backwards from the clinical condition, a phenotype or set of symptoms to use as potential functional targets for initial screening. Subsequently, when an active hit or lead compound is identified, target deconvolution has to be carried out to investigate potential mechanism(s) of action. Recently, proposals have been made for establishing a \"chain of translatability,\" starting with the identification of a disease-associated molecular characteristic or signature such as a disease-associated gene expression profile. 146 This is then succeeded by cellular models which aim to reconstruct a cellular phenotype as similar as possible to that of the disease condition and subsequently, use of relevant animal models of disease.",

This approach is also taken in our laboratories, using different test models with a range of functional, molecular, biochemical, and imaging methods, at various stages of compound testing, to reflect the clinical conditions. 50, 147, 148 Where the target consists of a complex of interacting mechanisms, as in pain, a computational functional genomics-based approach can help to improve accuracy, clarifying both the specific targets to aim at for defined pain types and also offering insight into the target mechanisms for pharmacological modification either by individual drugs or a combination of therapeutic agents. 149 Sequential-slowing down the target, before moving in to the hit/kill, by aiming sequentially at one or more targets upstream and then one or more targets downstream, using single drugs with multiple actions or a combination of drugs with varied actions. This is illustrated by the long-established combination in a single dosage form of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, an inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthetase, and trimethoprim, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. Together they act synergistically to inhibit the bacterial synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid. A further example of this approach is the sequential combination of drugs acting at different stages of cell signal pathways. Several growth factors act through the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway which is crucial for cell proliferation and angiogenesis. A downstream effector of this pathway is the regulatory protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Addition of the anticancer drug, docetaxol to adenocarcinoma cells in vitro for 24 hours, followed by the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus was highly synergistic in suppressing phosphorylation of mTOR as well as in suppressing proliferation in lung cancer cell lines. 150 The authors proposed that this sequential combination may be effective in overcoming resistance of tumors to mTOR inhibitors.",

A wide variety of different pharmacological, physical, nutritional, and other procedures are used in the hospital setting to treat the ill patient. However, a therapeutic program synchronized for the various factors we have discussed is rare. Considerable potential appears to exist in modifying the gut microbiota to improve drug efficacy, as discussed previously in relation to drug metabolism. Thus, by modulating the gut bacterial population there is increasing evidence that the efficacy of current anticancer chemotherapeutics can be enhanced and their toxicity reduced, 152 perhaps by simple measures such as regular use of probiotics. Obviously, in the treatment of all human diseases, drug therapy is usually just one of the measures taken to improve the health of the patient. But the optimal conditions for implementing supportive measures are not often assessed, certainly not in preclinical investigations. For instance, the efficacy of the appetite suppressant, diethylpropion, used clinically to cause short-term weight loss, was greater when given to rats at night when their activity was greatest and when the animals were also placed on high fat dietary restriction. 153 In many chronic diseases, muscle loss occurs and general metabolic deficiencies arise. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for instance, there is increasing evidence that combined nutritional and exercise interventions can be effectively used in combination with drug therapy. 154 In contrast, in the treatment of cancer, caloric restriction, as with ketogenic diets, has been found to both enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity. 155 Measurements taken during such synchronized treatment studies should be made at set times and seasons, allowing for the fact that the duration of action of some drugs is long. Such synchronization of drug therapy with other factors will undoubtedly become possible in the near future, as the combined use of the 4Ds, drugs, diagnostics, devices and (big) data, becomes increasingly possible. 156 In any case, even with established drugs, it is crucial to be vigilant and to be aware of new findings that can impact the way in which drugs are prescribed and used.",

Although diet can be controlled during phase 1 clinical trials in human volunteers, such dietary control is much less feasible in later stage trials. Intake of various types of fatty acids, trace elements and fruits rich in vitamins can all affect immune responses. For example, adequate zinc and selenium intake is necessary for the effective functioning of the immune system. 59 Among other effects, zinc is important as a cofactor for T-cell signaling, thereby facilitating differentiation and maturation of T lymphocytes, as well as promoting phagocyte and NK cell function. 59 It is often used as an adjuvant treatment for infections and is recommended by the WHO for infectious diarrhea in children in developing countries. 60,61 Selenium is crucial for the function of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes and other endogenous selenoproteins, such as thioredoxin reductases.

Changes in the external environment, in addition to modifying the epigenetic profile, nutritional condition, and gut microbiome, can also modify targets and their responses to drugs. The modern propensity for travel, for instance, carries with it additional constraints. Most of us are aware of the physical challenges of intercontinental air travel: jetlag, sleeplessness and lack of concentration and difficulty in adjustingto seasonal and daylight alterations. The reason is that our whole organism, including individual cells, is regulated by body clocks and autoregulatory products of cellular clock genes which regulate transcription factors and control our daily circadian and seasonal rhythms.73 Jetlag results predominantly from light-induced modification in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master body clock, which governs subsequent changes in the periphery. These include alterations in the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland which govern the sleep/wake cycle.74 Light is, thus, widely viewed as a \"time giver\" or in German, Zeitgeber. Not only is our sleeping behavior regulated by the light-induced release of the pineal hormone melatonin, but the courses of diseases can also be modulated by light.75 An example is the common symptom of rheumatic diseases, morning stiffness, resulting from disturbance in patients of the diurnal modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and endogenous anti-inflammatory cortisol levels, as seen also with corticosterone in experimental arthritis in rats.76 Cortisol levels are inappropriately low in patients in the early morning and are mirrored by changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts and proinflammatory cytokines which have the opposite circadian cycle.77 Restoration of normal circadian rhythms may well be the reason why in years past, patients with rheumatic diseases improved considerably when sent to sanatoria in sunny countries and helps to explain some of the regenerative effects of sleep in various disorders.

There is growing evidence that in patients with severe sepsis, kept in an intensive care unit for days, the circadian rhythm is disturbed. Modification of the light and dark cycle by intensifying the contrast and minimizing light-dark disruption or treating with melatonin can exert beneficial effects on the outcome of the condition.75,82,83 At least in immuno-inflammatory disorders, it is worth pointing out that the cyclical circulating concentrations of melatonin, itself a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, may exert a direct effect on immunopathology.84 All these light-induced variables markedly affect the sensitivity and responsiveness of molecular targets and alter their response to drug actions.Such cyclic changes may not just be diurnal, occurring over a 24-hour light-dark period, but seasonal (circannual) changes arise as a result of shortening and lengthening of the daylight time. This is not of great significance in laboratory animals, as they are kept under controlled conditions. It is highly likely that the pharmacological responses to many drugs in humans, however, depend on both circadian and circannual rhythms. It was shown recently that 400 genes associated with the immune system in white blood cells and adipose tissue show very marked circannual variations.85 In Europe, the peak expression of anti-inflammatory genes, such as the anti-inflammatory circadian transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, and the nadir of inflammatory genes such as interleukin-6, occurs in July and the reverse in December. The opposite pattern is seen in Oceania.At least in humans, introduction of a healthy diet, regular sleep, and exercise can go a long way toward synchronizing many biorhythms and stabilize drug targets. Interestingly, such modifications of lifestyle have clear effects on chromatin modifications which reflect the extent of biological aging.86 This finding provides further evidence for the possibility to modify with drugs, diet, or exercise the epigenetic processes that are associated with age-induced deterioration or adverse mutation.",

This clarification also includes the time or phase of the disease process during which the target mechanism is most intimately involved and therefore, most susceptible to pharmacological intervention. Unfortunately, this improved understanding of the optimal timing for drug administration does not always lead to a modification of disease therapy since established drug use tends to be modified more as a result of limiting side-effects than as a result of optimization of efficacy based on improved understanding of pharmacology. Two examples of the importance of timing for drug efficacy can be cited.Acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin has been used for anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic therapy for nearly 150 years and it is now being used as an antiplatelet and potentially anticancer agent. It has been estimated that 2000 tons of acetylsalicylic acid are synthesized annually, though in many cases, together with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is clearly overused. This is particularly the case in the elderly, as the many thousands of deaths due to drug-induced gastrointestinal bleeding attest.98 What most patients and presumably prescribing physicians are unaware of is the fact that NSAIDs generally provide only symptomatic relief from pain and inflammation and have little effect on the time course of acute inflammation. This is certainly true of the common cold, a viral infection, in which only the inflammatory symptoms are reduced.99",

Polymorphisms in oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) are very well documented and are the basis for clear guidelines on the assessment of potential drug-drug interactions in terms of metabolic interference between concomitant drug therapies. 94,119,120 As considered earlier, such metabolic interactions become even more important in the elderly, in whom polypharmacy is common and rate of metabolism decreases, making interactions much more likely. 94 Exercise and sport on the one hand, but factors such as smoking on the other hand, can have profound effects on the expression of metabolic enzymes. These effects include discrete modification of the methylation of the key metabolic regulatory enzyme adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in blood and skeletal muscle cells. 121 Consequently, lifestyle changes may not only affect susceptibility to disease, as discussed above in relation to chronobiology, but also the metabolism of drugs. The gut microbiome can exert profound effects on drug metabolism. Thus, metabolism by gut microbiota of uremic solutes, bile acids and steroid hormones can lead to modification of both phase I CYP-mediated oxidative reactions, as well as phase II drug conjugating enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferases or sulfotransferases, affecting the metabolism of a number of drugs. 122 Conversely, bacterial enzymes can directly metabolize some drugs, thereby affecting their efficacy.

The same approach is used in military actions, to slow down or damage a superior opponent and thereby, it becomes easier to destroy. To use the metaphor we started with in the introduction, the sometimes crazy movement of cars at a major road intersection is best controlled by forcing the cars into specific lanes and introducing co-ordinated traffic lights. The potential for traffic jams is markedly reduced.In pharmacological terms, this can be achieved by the co-ordinated use of different drugs. A comparable concept has been proposed in relation to drug doses used for the treatment of disease.135,136 The authors, for instance, suggested that a combination of low doses of anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs acting at different stages in the generation and action of PGE 2 [on release of substrate by phospholipase A 2 , metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclo-oxygenase and microsomal PGE synthase and finally action of PGE 2 on its different receptors] could be used.

With global concern awakened by recent epidemics of influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola and Zika viruses, the need for effective antivirals has become more urgent.

With a combination of drugs, including non-nucleotide and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and viral entry inhibitors, the introduction of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy, composed of at least three different drugs, has effectively reduced the mutation rate and enabled many chronically HIV-infected patients to live relatively normal lives.18 Such combination therapy directed at a specific viral target is also under extensive investigation for the therapy of other viral infec-If the target is not specific and the use of the therapeutic armament is too indiscriminate, like a shotgun, the long-term therapeutic outcome can be potentially worse than the disease originally targeted.

Intriguingly, recent detailed docking studies with over 3 million compounds revealed it is possible to bias the effect of a compound acting on a single receptor toward one or the other downstream signaling processes. Docking to the \u03bc-opioid-receptor led to the identification of a compound which preferentially activated signaling through the G protein Gi, with clear analgesic activity, avoiding signaling through the \u03b2-arrestin pathway, associated with the side-effects of respiratory depression, constipation, and tolerance.138 In view of the much increased understanding of signaling pathways, this might be a promising approach.Screening conditions, in addition, should reflect, as closely as possible, those occurring in the immediate environment of the putative disease target. A recent review has drawn up a generic set of principles-including genomic context, cellular heterogeneity, incubation conditions and relevant stimuli-by which a suitable in vitro screening cell system can be established.139 Even repurposing of known drugs for new indications can be more specific. In this context, a set of guidelines has been proposed to facilitate in vitro test selection for kinase inhibitors-which have a variety of off-target effects-in order to define potentially therapeutically beneficial offtarget pharmacological effects.140 Stratification of animal and clinical systems, based on biomarkers or genetic clustering, as well as F I G U R E 4 Proposed drug treatment measures to reduce pharmacological plasticity age, sex, and disease stage, even diet, with consideration of circadian and circannual rhythms, should also improve specificity. To gain a hold on some of these less easily controllable variables, it is essential to make effective use of reference compounds. This involves checking whether their responses remain the same under all conditions and whether the pharmacological response from the test situation is as expected. Since the reference compound may also have some off-target effects, a biomarker of its mechanism of action should be included.Simultaneous-multitargeting several mechanisms at once.Currently, this usually involves treating diseases with multiple drugs.We have already seen how in the elderly this can cause problems.It is preferable if individual drugs can be developed with multiple relevant actions. Recent studies suggest that single small molecule compounds may be developed to hit several targets simultaneously.Thus, glitazone compounds have been described recently for metabolic disorders with partial PPAR\u03b3 agonist, potent COX-2 antagonist (nanomolar IC50 values) and moderate 15-LOX inhibitor (micromolar IC50 values) activities. These compounds were anti-inflammatory on macrophages in vitro and in acute inflammation in vivo.141 Whether this activity requires all mechanisms of action or can be attributed to just one or two of them, remains to be established. Other approaches to multi-targeting include network targeting, as with optogenetics in which neuronal circuits are modulated by marking of specific genes with rhodopsin which responds to light,142 or with phenotypic assays which use functional readouts as opposed to single target-based assays. Considerable interest has arisen in the use of phenotype assays, both in primary cellular or stem cell systems in vitro and in animal models of disease.143,144 For instance, it was reported that NSI-189, a benzylpiperizine-aminiopyridine that stimulates general neurogenesis of human hippocampus-derived neural stem cells in vitro, is able to exert multidomain effects on cognition and depression, suggesting that phenotypic multitargeting may also be viable for CNS disorders.",
