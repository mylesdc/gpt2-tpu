For laboratory diagnosis of H7N9 virus infection, related studies and guidelines have confirmed that the nucleic acid-positive rate of lower respiratory specimens, such as sputum, airway aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, is higher than that of upper respiratory specimens (1, 2) . Clinicians give preference to sputum specimen for influenza virus test and genotyping because this kind of specimen is easy to obtain. However, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) of sputum specimens yields false-negative results owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus (3) . Meanwhile, viscous sputum specimens usually cannot undergo automated extraction, and thus, a pre-homogenization process is desirable before isolating nucleic acids for rRT-PCR. In fact, some influenza A virus (IAV) detection kits lack homogenization reagents, and some clinical laboratories may have applied improper preprocessing methods, such as adding normal saline (NS) and mixing by vortex.",

            "text": "During H7N9 virus epidemic, nearly 60% of the specimens received by laboratories to detect influenza virus were sputum. For these specimens, appropriate preprocess was essential. In this study, all of the sufficient sputum samples were preprocessed in three methods, IAV RNA extracted and tested by the same method, and comparison results were of important guiding significance. It was reported previously that treatment with N-acetyl-lcysteine and sodium citrate solution came out in whole homogenization of sputum samples, which was unable to destroy mRNA or rRNA of mycobacteria in sputum samples. However, for the purpose of detecting RNA targets in purulent sputum, this method was not appropriate (3, 9) . DTT and PK are often used for the homogenization processing of sputum specimens, which can fully digest mucous protein, release epithelial cells, and consequently increase the concentration of extracted RNA. Purulent sputum samples with treatment of DTT or PK can undergo automated extraction. Based on the experimental results of 217 specimens, our conclusion is that DTT and PK could be used to improve the homogenization effects of sputum and increase the positive rates by 5.53-6.91% higher than that of the NS group. Of the 17 missed specimens, 9 were genotyped as H7N9. Although these specimens were weakly positive, the missed detection of these highly pathogenic agents might result in serious consequences (1) . Vortex with NS is often adopted in respiratory viruses' culture from sputum, but the method is not appropriate for detection of IAV by rRT-PCR.",

Comparison of 49 positive specimens in all of the three groups demonstrated that the Ct values of the DTT and PK groups were significantly lower and their nucleic acid concentration and A260/A280 ratio within 1.8-2.0 were higher than those of the NS group. This finding might be attributed to the inability of NS to dilute sticky sputum through violent vortex. Some cells cannot be released from sticky sputum and thus lead to inadequate specimen decomposition and RNA extract reduction. Meanwhile, high amounts of proteins in sticky liquid are retained and can influence PCR by disturbing the cell lysis of nucleic acid extraction that inhibits DNA polymerase activity.",

For few negative specimens, concentration and purity were higher, which was inconsistent with the results. Therefore, the nucleic acid purity and concentration examined with a spectrophotometer were not the only factor that determined the positive rate. These findings indicated that false-negative results might be attributed to PCR inhibitor residues in nucleic acids. Further optimizing of liquefier combinations, preprocessing steps and nucleic acid extraction reagents could be conducted to decrease PCR inhibitors and increase target nucleic acid concentration.",
