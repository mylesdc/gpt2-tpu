As one component of the PHEPR system, information contributed by health care providers (HCPs) to public health is aggregated, analyzed and used by public health agencies, in part, to inform early event detection and situational awareness [2] .

In public health responses involving bioterrorism, HCPs have an especially important role since they will likely report such cases of unexplained or unusual illness to state and local public health officials who, in turn, may be able to conduct investigations and identify specific epidemiologic patterns or characteristics potentially indicative of bioterrorism [12] .",

To do this, and given that individuals will seek medical care in multiple locations during an emergency, HCPs need to be aware of public health threats and emergencies, issue guidelines and updates, and facilitate surveillance [14] . On September 11, 2001, when telephone and paging systems failed, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene successfully used email and fax to distribute public health broadcast alerts to all NYC emergency departments, commercial and hospital laboratories, infection-control programs, and select providers [15] . In an emergency, effective communication will not only depend on the information/message, but on the type of communication system or tool, the delivery format, and the robustness of the system. While timely, efficient, and effective communications between public health and HCPs is an important part of public health emergency preparedness and response (PHEPR), most publications concerned with this exchange have emphasized the HCP-to-public health component. Yet, it is well-established that the \"return\" of information to HCPs is also significant. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the systems and tools used by public health to generate PHEPR communications to HCPs, and to identify specific characteristics of message delivery mechanisms and formats that may be associated with effective PHEPR communications.",

Given its wide coverage, we were surprised to find so few studies attempting to systematically verify that HAN messages are received, processed, and/or acted upon by the intended recipients outside of public health agencies. As a result, in part, of current studies of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, we are now learning that PHEPR messages may not be reaching their targeted audiences. For example, results of a cross-sectional survey of health departments, physicians, and pharmacists in Kentucky regarding information dissemination and receipt during the early H1N1 outbreak found that deficiencies exist in the effectiveness of public health PHEPR communications to HCPs. While 81% of responding local health departments (LHDs) rated their capacity to disseminate information to HCPs as very good or excellent, only 52% of surveyed physicians and 16% of surveyed pharmacists reported receiving any information about H1N1 from a LHD. Seventy-four percent of pharmacists were not aware of their LHD's emergency plan in the event of an influenza outbreak [31] .",

While any PHEPR situation presents challenges in communicating about uncertainties, collaborating across and within organizations, and communicating timely messages [32] , every additional messaging source raises the potential for redundant and conflicting information. COCA disseminates updates bi-weekly (more frequently when there is emergency information or event-specific updates). Excluding HAN alerts, a tally of messages disseminated through COCA from 2008-2010 yielded 140 messages that each contain as many as 7 topical messages.",

Staes et al (2011) presented an objective analysis of communication between public health agencies, health care organizations, and frontline HCPs during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. The investigators conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand communication processes between public health and frontline HCPs and found that HCPs received redundant messages; were challenged to keep up with evolving and tailored messages from multiple organizations at a time when clinic volumes, patient concerns, and media exposure were increasing; and were overwhelmed by e-mail volume. The study suggests that PHEPR messages sent to HCPs be concise and clearly identified [33] .",

For practical reasons we limited ourselves to materials written in the English language. While we did not limit ourselves to U.S. systems or studies, it is possible that systems of PHEPR messaging to HCPs developed in Europe and Asia may be written in other languages. It is also possible that our search strategy did not cast either a wide or targeted enough net to capture relevant literature. Perhaps modifications to the terminology or concept operators would have yielded better retrieval sets. We were limited to resources accessible through our academic libraries and their inter-library partnerships so may have missed some material. Another limitation is our elimination of articles missing or with uninformative abstracts. Again, it is possible that this omitted key articles from our results. Lack of data was an issue as many articles did not contain sufficient descriptive information. Despite these limitations, our results show that detailed descriptions of PHEPR messaging from public health to HCPs are scarce in the literature and, even when available are rarely evaluated in any systematic fashion.",

Given the importance of HCPs in PHEPR, more research needs to be done to further investigate how public health can communicate effectively with HCPs. There are numerous questions about these systems and tools that need to be answered, some basic, such as: Have PHEPR messages been successfully delivered? Were they read and, if yes, can the date or time of their delivery and their content be recalled? Is there an optimal frequency for sending PHEPR messages? What components of a message are most important for the message to be perceived as credible, authoritative, complete? What impact do PHEPR messages have on HCP behavior, surveillance or reporting of suspected or confirmed events of public health interest or PHEPR knowledge?",

The primary aim of REACH is to determine the effectiveness of various message delivery systems (email, fax, and SMS) for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs and to compare the effectiveness of communication methods between these two groups across diverse communities. This is however, only one effort. To meet present-day and future information needs for emergency preparedness, concentrated attention needs to be given to evaluating the effectiveness of PHEPR systems in a scientifically rigorous manner [36] .",
