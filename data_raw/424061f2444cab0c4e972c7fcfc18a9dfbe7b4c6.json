The timeliness gap was calculated as the difference in days between the report release dates of the matching outbreaks in the WHO and ProMED-mail systems. Civil liberties scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses were collected to reflect countries' development and health workforce statuses. Then, logistic regression was performed to determine the correlation between the timeliness gap and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status, controlling for year.",

In response to the outbreak of SARS, the 58 th World Health Assembly adopted a new set of International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) on May 23, 2005 to close the gaps in the global health surveillance system. As the only regulations for the global surveillance of high-priority infectious diseases, the revision of IHR 2005 responded to the needs of an effective global health surveillance system [6, 20] . IHR 2005 not only included national obligations to achieve a set of core surveillance and response capacities by eliminating technical, resource, governance, legal and political obstacles in the health system, it also required members to assess any public health emergency of international concern within 48 hours and to notify the WHO within 24 hours to ensure the timely receipt of the information. In addition, the WHO was allowed to consider reports from unofficial sources, in accordance with Article 9 [21] . Because public health events overlap with trade and security issues, global health surveillance issues have attracted increasing attention. However, the effects of IHR 2005 on the reporting timeliness gap and the association between transparency and the reporting timeliness gap have yet to be evaluated.",

Transparency can be represented by the extent of civil liberties and the circulation of public information. Civil liberties are the rights and freedoms that protect individuals from unfair infringement by the government of the nation in which they reside and are the basic tenets of democracy. Moreover, civil liberties set limits on the government so that its members cannot abuse their power and interfere unduly with the affairs of private citizens. Countries with strong civil liberties typically also have well developed mass media that is capable of reporting infectious disease news promptly after its occurrence [22] . Therefore, the public can receive information about a disease outbreak earlier through media or other channels in countries with better transparency. Consequently, in countries with good civil liberties, ProMEDmail might receive reports of new emerging infectious diseases from individuals or the media and release the information earlier than the WHO, which would likely receive official information from the government at a later time and post reports after receiving official clearance.",

More specifically, we first collected all avian flu and H1N1 disease outbreak reports released on the WHO Disease Outbreak News website [25] . We then looked for the same disease incident report on the ProMED-mail website based on the information indicated in the original WHO report, including disease name, country, date of onset and other details [13] . For multi-country outbreak reports from the WHO, each country report was matched separately with its corresponding report in ProMED-mail. Outbreak reports for China, Taiwan and Hong Kong were also separated for matching. In addition to the initial outbreak reports, WHO Disease Outbreak News also posts reports that are labelled as \"updates\". These reports were examined for details indicating the spread of the initial disease outbreak to other regions of the affected country. Where there was new information about the outbreak spreading to other areas, we searched ProMED-mail for a matching report. Updates that mentioned only an increased number of cases without additional information about geographical spread were excluded, as were reports about WHO technical meetings and epidemiological survey findings. Additional information about the release date and source of the reports in ProMED-mail were also collected for further analysis.",

Furthermore, the timeliness gap was significantly associated with civil liberties and human development indices but not health workforce density. Better civil liberties and human development were associated with longer delays in reporting of avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks. Following the emergence of the global threat of SARS, countries became increasingly aware of the importance of timely reporting and the need for global collaboration in infectious disease control. The sharp decrease in the timeliness gap between ProMED-mail and the WHO report presented in 2003 and 2004, immediately following the SARS outbreak, is one reflection of this awareness. With the development of this strong consensus, the International Health Regulation 2005 was adopted. The fact that the average timeliness gap of H1N1 reports was shorter than the timeliness gap of avian flu reports demonstrates an increasing awareness of the seriousness of not disclosing information regarding a \"public health emergency of international concern.\" As a result, the yearly average reporting timeliness gap decreased significantly over time. However, this result does not reflect an improvement in the timeliness gap between the real time of an outbreak and the reporting time. In countries with inadequate surveillance systems or with insufficient civil liberties to release outbreak information, the shortened timeliness gap might be meaningless for public health concerns. Thus, further study is needed to understand the relationship between improvements in reducing the timeliness gap and the timely reporting of outbreaks.",

It is undeniable that WHO reports are sometimes faster than ProMED-mail reports due to delays caused by countries' insufficient civil liberties. However, given that ProMED-mail, the non-official global surveillance system, can freely receive outbreak information from the media at any time, it is understandable that the reporting timeliness gap between ProMED-mail and the WHO was larger in countries with better civil liberties. The finding that countries with greater civil liberties have longer timeliness gaps is consistent with our hypothesis that outbreak news is reported and disseminated more quickly and easily by the mass media in countries with greater civil liberties. However, official reporting can be very much delayed due to the multiplicity of stakeholders or the tardiness inherent in the reporting procedures of bureaucracies in official organisations and systems [29, 30] .

            "text": "Similarly, human development was also found to be negatively associated with the timeliness gap. In general, countries with higher human development exhibited longer reporting timeliness gaps. Human development is defined by a combination of health, education and economic status indicators. According to previous studies, countries with greater civil liberties tend to be more democratic societies with better economic status, more widespread education and better overall health. Within a developed society, the complex process of administration undeniably slows the standard process and operation of official organisations and systems [29, 30] . Therefore, countries with higher human development status have longer average reporting timeliness gaps. However, it is important to note that human development is not always a negative predictor of reporting timeliness. The shortest timeliness gap was found not in countries with low human development scores but rather in countries with medium human development scores. In other words, human development plays a positive role in improving reporting timeliness for countries in which development remained substandard. Relatively poor health technology or health resources in countries with low human development scores may account for this phenomenon. However, further research is needed to better understand the relationships between these factors. No significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce was found in this study. Although a curved relationship between timeliness gap and health workforce was found, no significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce was indicated in our logistic regression analysis. The significant correlation between the health workforce density and the human development index might be one explanation for this finding. In addition, this phenomenon might reflect the importance of public health efforts other than health workforce density. Although an adequate health workforce is one of the fundamental components of any public health system, there are other important factors related to reporting timeliness, such as the quality of the health workforce, the awareness of unusual diseases among the health workforce, and the overall effectiveness of the healthcare system. Therefore, the lack of a significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce density in our study may be attributed to these additional factors.",

Although we analysed historical reporting timeliness gap data, we used human development and health workforce data from a single year to analyse the association between timeliness gap and the various factors. Thus, changes in human development status and health workforce density from 2003 to 2009 were not accounted for in this study. In addition, the sharp decrease in the timeliness gap between ProMEDmail and WHO reports in 2003 may produce spurious results. Moreover, the results of our study might overemphasise the effect of transparency on the reporting timeliness gap because we were not able to analyse other factors related to the timeliness of reporting, such as IT and communication infrastructure.",

In addition, this study found significant associations between the reporting timeliness gap and civil liberties and human development. We have discussed this phenomenon previously, as well as the need to explore these issues in further studies. We suggest that efforts to increase transparency should be considered to further improve the global disease surveillance system. In the meantime, we must also consider that even with the best intentions, the release of disease information can be delayed by complex factors such as the number of stakeholders involved and the complex internal reporting systems of multiple official organisations.
