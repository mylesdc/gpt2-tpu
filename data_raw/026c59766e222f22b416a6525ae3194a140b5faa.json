            "text": "Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance, are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents of significance to human and animal health. In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges.",

            "text": "Bats (order Chiroptera, 1232 species [1] ), the only mammals capable of actively sustained flight, are among the most diverse and species-rich vertebrate taxa. They play key roles in various ecosystems throughout the world [2, 3] . Furthermore, they also harbour pathogens and act as reservoir hosts of viruses that might be of relevance to human and domestic animal health [2] . Although the transmission of viruses from bats to humans has been proven only for rabies and some other lyssaviruses [3] , as well as for Nipah [4] and Hendra virus [5] and assumed for SARS-CoVlike viruses [6] , a wide range of highly pathogenic viruses have been detected in bats, e.g. Ebola [7] and Marburg [8] viruses. As a consequence, virus discovery techniques have in recent years been used widely to identify previously unknown viruses in bats and have led to recognition of numerous new species in saliva, faeces as well as in respiratory and alimentary specimens (e.g. astroviruses [9] , coronaviruses [10] , paramyxoviruses [11] . In some cases the identified viruses (e.g. coronaviruses) are phylogenetically related to human viruses [10] indicating possible prior transmission to humans, although for most viruses there are no indications for recent zoonotic transmissions from bats to humans. The majority of the newly described bat viral species are RNA viruses, but several DNA viruses (e.g. circoviruses [12] , polyomaviruses [13] , adenoviruses [14] and herpesviruses [15] ) have also been detected recently. In addition, two studies describe the identification of members of the Parvoviridae family in fecal samples of different species of bats [12, 16] The Parvoviridae, comprising the subfamily Parvovirinae (viruses that infect vertebrates) and the subfamily Densovirinae (viruses that infect arthropods), are non-enveloped viruses, containing a single stranded DNA genome of approximately 5 kb. The Parvovirinae subfamily is currently subdivided into 5 well established genera (Parvovirus, Amdovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Bocavirus) and a new genus (PARV-4 like viruses) that contains 5 viruses that have recently been identified: Human Parvovirus 4 (PARV4, identified in humans in 2005) [17] classified into three genotypes, Bovine Hokovirus (BoHV, 2008) [18] , Porcine Hokovirus (PoHV, 2008) [18] [19] , and a Chimpanzee and a Baboon PARV4-like virus (2010) [20] . Some of the Parvovirinae viruses require a co-infection with a helper virus to be perpetuated (the majority of the viruses within the genus Dependovirus), but most can replicate autonomously.",

So far virus discovery in bats was predominately performed in stool samples [9, 12, 14, 16] , but we chose serum/EDTA-plasma samples since human parvoviruses can appear in high concentrations in blood [21] . Three bat species were examined: Eidolon helvum and Artibeus jamaicensis/A. lituratus, frugivorous bats from Ghana and Panama, respectively. A sequence independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing [22] . By applying this methodology two new parvoviruses were identified. To further analyze the characteristics of these new viruses, the nearly fulllength genome sequences were determined, their prevalence in the respective populations was investigated, and viral concentrations in blood and different organs were determined.

The technique was successfully used to discover human coronavirus NL63 [36] . Nowadays, VIDISCA is combined with second generation sequencing techniques and the method allows identification of viruses in clinical samples [22] . In search for previously unknown bat parvoviruses we combined VIDISCA with Roche-454 sequencing and generated high amounts of sequence reads from pools of bat blood derived from various bat species originating from Ghana and Panama (in total 227931 reads). In one pool of 2 serum samples collected from frugivorous Eidelon helvum bats from Ghana and in one pool of 50 EDTA blood samples collected from frugivorous Artibeus jamaicensis bats from Panama 136 parvoviral hits (0.65% of the Eidelon helvum bat reads, resulting in 15 different fragments) and 168 parvoviral hits (2.4% of the Artibeus jamaicensis bat reads, resulting in 22 different fragments) were identified. Respectively 42.5% and 52.5% of the complete genome were obtained with VIDISCA-454.",

All these characteristics offer the opportunity to pathogens to easily be maintained within the population and to be diffused in other populations and different geographical areas.

Among DNA viruses, parvoviruses exhibit the highest mutation rate, almost comparable to that possessed by RNA viruses, and they are extremely recombination prone [43] . Furthermore, host-switching has been reported [40] , although co-divergence (lead by co-evolution) of parvoviruses and their host is also noticed [44] . All these characteristics make parvoviruses one of the most likely candidates to be future emerging viruses. For these reasons it is of extreme importance to further pursue the search for novel parvoviruses and to clarify the real impact of the circulation of these viruses in bats and other mammals to identify and better characterize mechanisms linked to zoonotic transmission and host switching.",

            "text": "To evaluate whether bats carry viruses belonging to the Parvovirinae subfamily, we analyzed blood samples from two phylogenetically distant bat families [45] living in distant geographical areas. Both groups share similar ecological traits as they both feed on fruits as main diet. We used VIDISCA, a sequence independent virus discovery technique, combined with Roche-454 high throughput sequencing and discovered 2 novel members of the subfamily Parvovirinae: Eh-BtPV-1, a PARV4-like virus, identified in Ghanaian Eidelon helvum bats and Aj-BtPV-1, initially identified in Panamanian Artibeus jamaicensis bats and representing the first member of a putative new parvoviral genus. To our knowledge, Eh-BtPV-1 is the first potentially autonomously replicating member of the subfamily Parvovirinae identified in bat blood. Eh-BtPV-1 exhibits monophyletic origin with human PARV4 and the other primate, bovine and porcine viruses more recently identified [17] [18] [19] [20] . Unfortunately the baboon virus could not be included in the phylogenetic analysis due to the limited length of baboon viral sequence that is available (296 nts). Interestingly, based on computational prediction, beyond the putative major ORFs of Eh-BtPV-1 a small ORF termed MARF was additionally found in the unique part of VP1 overlapping the PLA 2 motif, but in a different reading frame. MARF was subsequently detected in all PARV4-like viruses so far known suggesting that the presence of this ORF characterizes this putative genus. Besides, Eh-BtPV-1 resembles a separate branch within the genus and, amongst the PARV4-like viruses identified until now it is the virus closest to the root of the genus. These data may suggest that a possible zoonotic transmission could have occurred in the past allowing the ancestor virus to be transmitted from bats to other mammals, as it has been already proposed for SARS-CoV [6] and other coronaviruses [10] . Since Eh-BtPV-1 is equally divergent from primates, bovine and porcine viruses, an independent introduction of an ancestral bat virus into different mammalian species can be hypothesized. It can also be assumed that either humans or other mammals could have played a role in transmitting the ancestral virus from bats to the other species. However, for exactly clarifying the role of bats in the evolution of this group a greater spectrum of PARV4-like viruses potentially present in bats has to be elucidated.",

Since the colonies are often in close contact with the human population and in some African areas the bats are habitually used as source of food [47] , as is the case with Eidolon helvum in Ghana [48] , studies are needed to investigate whether the virus could be transmitted to a human host, e.g., by antibody studies in individuals involved in bat bush meat processing.",

Aj-BtPV-1 was circulating in the respective A. jamaicensis population at a rate of 7.6% and, based on phylogenetic analysis, it clearly appears that at least three different lineages are currently circulating in this bat species. Interestingly, Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in blood collected from a bat belonging to the closely related species A. lituratus. Although the number of analyzed A. lituratus bat is low (18) , the prevalence of viraemia (5.5%) was close to that detected in Artibeus jamaicensis bats. Aj-BtPV-1 is the first member of a potential new genus within the Parvovirinae subfamily, although its existence needs first to be accepted by the advisory board of the ICTV. Still, its discovery could open new research paths aiming to search for similar viruses in other mammals including humans. The presence of high viral variability may also increase the chance that further mutations could favor a viral transmission to other species. Artibeus jamaicensis, a bat from the endemic family of New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) that only occurs in Central and South America, forages mainly on fruit and occasionally nectar, pollen and leaves [49, 50] . It regularly covers several kilometers in search of suitable food resources, thereby crossing barriers such as open water [50, 51] . This foraging behavior can bring animals in contact with humans and other animals, i.e., livestock, especially when agricultural farming areas are used as foraging grounds [39] .",

Additionally, in one of these studies a virus (TM-2p) was identified which is topologically located in the phylogenetic tree between the two parvoviral subfamilies Parvovirinae and Densovirinae [12] . Since fecal samples from insectivorous bats were investigated, TM-2p might be a virus infecting insects rather than bats and gotten into stools after having been ingested through the diet [12] .

Our data also indicate that the viruses can spread easily throughout the body and that they circulate within the bat population with frequencies up to 8%. Furthermore, the presence of bat parvovirus in the intestinal tissue suggests that those viruses might be present in feces, as already reported for adeno-associated bat parvoviruses. Taken together, the data from the present and previous studies [12, 16] demonstrate that a variety of parvoviruses is currently associated with bats with different geographic origin (Old and New World), different phylogenies (Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae and Molossidae), different ecologies (fruit eaters and insectivores) as well as climatic ranges (temperate to tropical regions).
