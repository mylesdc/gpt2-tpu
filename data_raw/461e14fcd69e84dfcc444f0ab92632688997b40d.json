            "text": "Over the past three decades, the swine industry in the United States has experienced several significant disease outbreak events with highly pathogenic viral pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and, most recently, the swine enteric coronaviruses, including porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (1) (2) (3) (4) . These disease events have resulted in significant clinical consequences with increased morbidity and mortality, in some cases reaching 100%, as well as economic devastation to the swine industry with financial losses estimated in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (1, 5) . Among other shared characteristics, all three causative agents had been previously known to cause mild or non-pathogenic disease in swine prior to the re-emergence event (4) . Additionally, emerging and/or novel diseases that present with common clinical signs consistent with expected production diseases may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to widespread transmission amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence of a disease outbreak with high morbidity, high mortality, and rapid, transboundary spread brings about fundamental questions regarding the epidemiology and origin of the agent as well as an immediate need for both short-and longterm response activities and mitigation strategies to control the outbreak and prevent future events (4) .",

Additionally, genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that United States (U.S.) strains of PEDV were closely related to Chinese strains, particularly the 2012 strain from Anhui Province in China (10) , fueling concerns that imported, contaminated commodities from China may have been the route of introduction into the United States. Growing anecdotal evidence and early investigative studies (11) have further implicated feed and feed ingredients as the possible transmission vehicle for PEDV although the source(s) and route(s) of introduction have not been definitively identified. Compounded by the recent outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in Asia and Europe 1 , there is rising concern that contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed, could introduce Abbreviations: ASF(V), African swine fever (virus); Ct, cycle threshold; DDGS, dried distillers grain with solubles; LA, liquid antimicrobial; MCFA, medium chain fatty acid blend; PCV2, porcine circovirus type 2; PDCoV, porcine delta coronavirus; PED(V), porcine epidemic diarrhea (virus); PHFD, porcine high fever disease; PRRS(V), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (virus); PRV, pseudorabies virus; SDPP, spray-dried porcine plasma; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. 1 World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) (2018) .

PHFD is considered a PRRS-related syndrome. Using a survey administered to individual households in a southern province of Vietnam, investigators found that, among other things, the use water green crop as pig feed and the presence of ducks, with or without direct contact with pigs were positively associated with clinical signs consistent with PHFD in swine. Water green crop are fed directly to pigs after harvest, without processing. The authors hypothesize that ducks potentially amplify the virus, similar to data shown for PRRSV, and contaminate the water green crop fed to pigs. It is also believed that porcine high fever disease virus can persist in water, further contaminating the greens before harvest. The findings of this study suggest that unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients could be contaminated with virus by other animals with subsequent transmission to swine (16) .",

The final logistical regression model showed that protecting feed and water sources, separation of sick and healthy pigs, and washing/disinfecting equipment were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. These findings indicate that preventing rodent access to feed sources and the use of commercial feeds, as opposed to swill feeding, were potentially protective measures in the farms studied (15) .",

A similar study focused on ASF in Latvia also suggested that feeding potentially contaminated (via wild boar) fresh grass or crops was a risk factor for ASF occurrence in backyard holdings; however, swill feeding could not be excluded as a source (19) . A study conducted in Kenya in 1921 demonstrated that ASFV could be transmitted to pigs when they consumed infected feces and urine but failed to transmit when contaminated sweet potatoes or bananas were consumed (20) . While several references were provided for documented transmission of ASFV to domestic pigs through feeding of swineorigin feed ingredients, there is limited data on the relationship of ASFV transmission and non-animal origin feed ingredients (17) .",

Feces from 30 pigs was collected, inoculated with Aujeszky's disease virus and blue eye disease virus, and mixed with molasses and sorghum for fermentation. Flasks of ensilage were incubated at room temperature for 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Presence of virus was detected by observation of cytopathic effects on cellular monolayers and indirect immunofluorescence. Samples were positive for virus on day 0 but not at any subsequent time point. The findings indicate that fermentation is sufficient for the inactivation of the viruses tested under the experimental conditions used and could be an acceptable means for eliminating these viruses from feces used for animal feed. These results may not be applicable to viruses of other families (23) .",

Fasina et al. (15) identified feed and water control to be significantly associated with decreased risk of ASF infection in Nigeria, noting that feed and water biosecurity practices can prevent virus contamination by rodents and wild birds (15) . Consistent with these findings, an expert opinion elicitation study conducted in Australia found industry representatives believed commercial pigs were most likely to be exposed to highly pathogenic PRRS through access to contaminated animal feed and feed additives imported from southeast Asia (18) . These studies suggest that protecting unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients from contact with animals may decrease the likelihood of pathogen contamination.

They used previously collected epidemiologic data to develop scenarios and identify hypothetical routes of PEDV introduction into the United States and conducted follow-up studies to gather evidence for the most plausible scenarios. The follow-up studies included testing organic soybeans and pet jerky treats imported from China and archived serum samples opportunistically collected from feral swine; all results were negative. The authors did not identify a proven source or route of PEDV introduction into the United States. However, it was suggested that incomplete farm feed/ration records negatively impacted investigators' ability to thoroughly evaluate the potential epidemiologic role of feed or feed ingredients. The authors identified totes used to transport bulk feed or feed ingredients as providing \"the simplest explanation\" for the investigation findings (27).",

The authors used a cell culture based assay and model fitting to estimate a delta value, calculated as an indicator of the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For the spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the greatest delta values were obtained for PDCoV and TGEV in soybean meal, at \u223c42 days each. Soybean meal at room temperature also provided the highest delta value for PEDV, at 7.5 days. Other findings indicated that at room temperature, moisture and ether content were important determinants of virus survival. The authors found no difference in virus survival in feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients incubated at temperatures higher than 70 \u2022 C.

PEDV was detected by RT-PCR in the interior of the unopened bags of the new supplier's pellets, suggesting contamination occurred prior to delivery of the feed to the farm. Additionally, the source facility (supplier) tested positive for PEDV as did individual ingredients at the source facility. Piglets were provided ad libitum access to the RT-PCR positive mash 3 (mean Ct = 36.5) along with dry pellets from the same lot for 7 days and observed for clinical signs of PED. During the bioassay, none of the pigs developed clinical signs of disease and diagnostic tests were negative for PEDV (31) . Explanations for the failure to demonstrate infectivity were similar to those provided by Pillatzki et al. (36) , with the addition that the small number of piglets used in the bioassay and the short feeding trial period lowered the sensitivity of the bioassay and did not realistically reflect the field setting. Despite the negative findings, Bowman et al. (31) stated \"feed cannot be ruled out\" as the source of the outbreak in the Ohio swine operation.",

Analysis of feed material across the 3 affected sites by real-time RT-PCR indicated the presence of PEDV RNA with Ct values ranging from 19.50 to 22.20. For the swine bioassay, piglets were divided into three groups: the treatment group; the positive-control group; and the negativecontrol group. Piglets were fed via natural feeding method. Clinical signs consistent with PED were observed in piglets in the treatment group and the positive-control group. At necropsy, rectal swabs and intestinal tract samples from the treatment group and the positive-control group were positive for PEDV by PCR and immunohistochemistry with evidence of microscopic lesions. In the negative group, clinical signs, viral shedding, or PEDV-positive intestinal tract samples were not observed. Molecular sequencing of viral RNA obtained from treatment and positive control groups confirmed consumption of feed and not cross-contamination as the source of infection (11) .",

Eighteen common swine feed ingredients were selected: corn, conventional soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), SDPP, purified plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal, red blood cells, 3 vitamin/trace mineral mixes, choice white grease, soy oil, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine, limestone, and dry choline chloride. Samples of each ingredient were divided into two groups (treated and nontreated), in replicate, and spiked with PEDV. The samples were stored outside in winter conditions in plastic totes. At 1, 7, 14, and 30 days post-inoculation, samples were removed for diagnostic testing. The samples were tested for PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV by RT-PCR. Viable PEDV, indicated by positive VI, at 30 days post-inoculation was detected from nontreated SBM, DDGS, red blood cells, meat and bone meal, lysine HCL, and D/L methionine. Non-treated choice white grease, threonine, and limestone were positive on VI at varying sampling days. Only SBM and meat and bone meal remained PCR positive at day 30; all LA-treated ingredients were VI negative (38) .",

Fourteen swine feed ingredients commonly imported from China to the United States were selected: organic and conventional soybeans and soybean meal (SBM), lysine HCL, D/L methionine, tryptophan, vitamins A, D, and E, choline chloride, rice hulls, corn cobs, and feed-grade tetracycline.

In addition to positive and negative controls, samples were treated with LA or MCFA and spiked with PEDV. The samples were housed in a programmed environmental chamber based on the temperature and percent relative humidity for each segment of the shipping journey. At designated days post-inoculation, samples were removed and submitted for diagnostic testing by RT-PCR and VI.

Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or protect virus survival. The feed ingredients that have shown to support virus survivability and viability include conventional soybean meal, lysine, choline chloride, and vitamin D (38, 39, 41) . Of interest, Dee et al. (41) noted that PED virus viability in organic SBM could not be demonstrated. This finding could discount previous speculation that the rise in organic swine farming may have contributed to PEDV introduction in to the United States. The authors also noted that ASFV demonstrated strong survivability characteristics, remaining viable under laboratory-simulated conditions with or without the feed matrix. Similarly, Senecavirus A, the surrogate for foot-and-mouth disease virus, showed the highest degree of stability as viable virus was recovered from 10 of 11 ingredients (41) . Both formaldehyde-based LA and MCFA treatment rendered virus inactive, regardless of ingredient type, suggesting these mitigants might be useful as part of a risk management strategy for reducing viral load in feed ingredients (38, 39) .",

There is a lack of field data demonstrating whether, how, and when non-animal origin feed ingredients may become contaminated with swine viruses. Further, although some field epidemiological investigations have associated contaminated (PCR positive) feed with the source of virus introduction on affected farms, to date, experimental studies of virus transmission via feed and feed ingredients have yielded inconsistent data. Additionally, the development of diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes of non-animal origin feed ingredients is necessary to allow more accurate estimation of the frequency with which these materials are contaminated with virus, which viruses are present, and, if present, at what concentrations. Subsequent assays to determine the level of virus in the final, processed feed product would be useful to estimate the likelihood that contaminated non-animal origin feed ingredients could serve as a transmission pathway for swine viruses and to what degree feed should be prioritized as a biosecurity risk.",

Similarly, the entry route for swine viruses into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among domestic swine farms. Thus, if swine viruses contaminate non-animal origin feed ingredients, a multi-modal transmission mechanism is likely to occur. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus transmission, it is important to understand how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel) interface with one another, in particular, how the production and distribution of feed interacts with other potential or known sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel) to contribute to disease transmission both into and within the United States. Similarly, it's important to understand the relative risks of various transmission pathways and where feed ingredients fit in among broadly accepted risk pathways such as movement of infected pigs and fecal contamination of fomites (e.g., transport vehicles). By understanding the magnitude of the risk of feed ingredients, one can better balance the costs of sourcing \"safe\" feed ingredients and the nutritional needs of pigs with the costs of applying various mitigation strategies to potentially contaminated feed (e.g., heat or chemical treatment or feed holding times).",

Commercial swine operations may use the absence of PRRS on the farm as an indicator of thorough implementation and enforcement of biosecurity measures. In the studies reviewed, Bowman et al. (31) stated that the \"effectiveness of the biosecurity measures in place was evidenced by the absence of PRRS cases.\" However, the entry of PEDV (and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial premises suggests that current biosecurity standards may be insufficient to prevent certain virus incursions. Virus characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry, including globalization of trade, intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive movement of pigs and related production components could contribute to biosecurity breaches. Robust biosecurity measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, to prevent the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity strategies, particularly the extensive movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to meet today's swine industry paradigm.",

A major knowledge gap exists in sources of potential contamination and where feed or feed ingredients may become cross-contaminated. Very little information is available on how non-animal origin feed ingredients are produced and sourced outside the United States and current studies have produced little scientific evidence of whether, how, or when non-animal origin feed ingredients become contaminated with swine viruses in regions outside the United States. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to contamination along the entire feed supply chain, from harvesting of plant-derived feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been identified. To compound this issue, reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes (bulk) of non-animal origin feed ingredients are not available. Taking a systematic approach to the entire (transboundary) feed production system, similar to the hazard analysis and critical control points process used in food safety, may help to identify vulnerabilities in the production process, better inform the development and application of mitigation measures to reduce viral contamination risks, and help stakeholders allocate resources toward mitigation measures based on the likelihood of virus contamination.",

If the primary concern lies in the importation of contaminated feed and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, processed, and transported prior to importation are needed. However, the lack of validated feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting small amounts of virus in large volumes of material limits the ability to determine whether and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients may become contaminated with viruses and limits the ability to identify critical control points in feed production, distribution, and storage to mitigate risk. Although LA and MCFA were shown to be effective chemical mitigants against PEDV, additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other chemical treatments, the application of heat or pressure (pelleting) to feed, and holding times for feed or feed ingredients. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination in the feed supply chain and virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.",

(36) used a swine bioassay to investigate whether PEDV PCR-positive samples of complete feed, feed premix, and SDPP (Ct values of 33.8, 34.2, and 30.0, respectively) that had been retained by feed manufacturers could serve as a source of PEDV transmission to neonatal swine. The piglets inoculated with the PEDV-positive feed samples along with the negative-control piglets remained negative for PEDV by PCR and clinically healthy throughout the study period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of PED. The authors provide several plausible explanations for the failure to demonstrate infectivity, including the nucleic acid detected in the feed samples did not represent infectious virus; the feed samples had relatively high Ct values (range: 30.0-36.5); and an extended storage time between collection of the sample and the bioassay may have reduced or eliminated the infectivity of the PEDV.
