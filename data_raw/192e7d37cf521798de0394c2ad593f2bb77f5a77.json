Job is one of the most important causes of anxiety in individual's lives (Rahimi, 2009; Mehrabi et al., 2005) . Anxiety disorders appear to be pervasive, and increasingly prevalent in workplaces in recent years. The etiology of most anxiety disorders, is multifactorial so, in most cases a combination of several factors cause anxiety including; individual genetic, developmental, work and non-work causes. It seems that, both; work-related organizational-individual and, social risk factors interact. The interaction determines the onset, progression and course of anxiety disorders (Saki et al., 2002; Mattew et al., 2003) .",

Also, their study showed that, nurses who were working at internal disease and surgery wards experienced maximum level of anxiety compared with another wards of hospital. Whereas in our study, the most important reason of anxiety was exposure with biologic factors at the workplace. Rahimi and colleagues in 2004 conducted a study in order to know the range of anxiety and related factors in nurses from Tehran hospitals. From all those samples 44.1%, 54.1 and 1.8% had experiences high, moderate and low level of anxiety, respectively. Etemadi et al. in 2004 evaluated relationship between occupation-related stress with nurses' job satisfaction at CCU and heart diseases wards in Tehran University of medical science. They concluded that stress level of the nurses working for less than one year and young nurses were significantly higher than other nurses. Another study in Hamedan by Khodaveisi and colleagues in 2005 , the maximum stress was seen in young nurses aged between 20-24 years old. Also, Married nurses had high stress compared with the single ones. In this study, there was a strong relationship between anxiety and age, so that, with increasing age, obvious and hidden anxiety decrease, significantly.",

Also, the most important factors related to stress was \"unpleasant smelling\" in operating room (76% of participants), and the least important factors was interrelationship with their colleagues (29.7% of paticipants). While, in this study, the most important cause for anxiety was concern about encountering with infected biologic factors. All health care providers in hospitals, especially nurses in Iran, are dealing with health-care issues related to the spread of serious infectious diseases, including: hepatitis B and C, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and HIV. In recent years, many efforts has been performed to reduce the risk of disease transmission to nurses at work place. However, the risks of being infected with these diseases are considered as one of the most important occupational disease yet (Costigliola et al., 2012) .",
