On the other hand, it is possible that the detection rate differs geographically. RSV was the most frequently virus detected in patients with respiratory infections, followed by PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV. Our data support previous reports of RSV, PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV as the major agents associated with LRTIs among children in a hospital setting. 12, [19] [20] [21] [22] The HBoV infection rate (24.1%) in the present study is consistent with earlier reports (1.9%-24.6% 8, 9, 16, [23] [24] [25] [26] , and the incidence of HMPV (18.2%) in patients with respiratory tract infections is similar to that in other regions (1.5%-18% 2, 9, 17, 23, [26] [27] [28] .

HMPV and HBoV frequently resulted in hospitalization, 8,16 which has been reflected in our results. There was no difference in the mean hospitalization duration of HBoV-positive (7.93 \u00b1 3.43 days) and HMPV-positive (8.28 \u00b1 3.57 days) patients. This is not in agreement with the study by Calvo, in which hospitalization duration was longer in patients with HMPV. However, our data are in line with the findings of Davis. 8 Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to young children with LRTIs due to the considerable hospitalization duration. In our study, HBoV and HMPV infections were almost completely confined to infants and children; 63.9% (168/263) of HBoV patients and 61.8% (123/199) of HMPV patients were hospitalized during their first year of life, in agreement with the study by Edwards. 17 This is likely due to the weak immunity of children aged <1 year.

In contrast, Jiang reported that coinfections were significantly more frequent among patients with a low than a high viral load. Previous studies 15,26 reported no difference in the clinical manifestations of children with single and multiple infections. In our study, patients infected with HBoV only were older (26.05 \u00b1 31.22 months) than those infected with HBoV and other respiratory viruses (15.89 \u00b1 18.94 months) (P = .005). Analyzing the correlation between viral load and coinfections is problematic because viral load can change rapidly over the disease course; this might explain the conflicting results among studies. Evaluating the clinical significance of one or more coinfecting viruses is difficult. 34 Viral load is an important determinant of the severity of LRTIs caused by HBoV and HMPV.16,36,37 Our findings indicated that a high viral load was not associated with more severe disease, in agreement with a previous study.6 However, the effect of viral load on disease severity remains controversial. Of the HBoV-and HMPV-positive patients, 83.7% (220/263) and 85.9% (171/199), respectively, were coinfections, and the coinfecting viruses may have contributed to disease severity.
