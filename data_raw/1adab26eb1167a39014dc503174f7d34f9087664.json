It is not well-known whether influenza virus infection affects cell death and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in HIV-1-infected patients. Using a lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, we examined the in vitro effects of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) infection on cell death and HIV-1 RNA production in infected cells. We found that pH1N1 infection increased apoptotic cell death through Fas and Bax-mediated pathways in HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. Infection with pH1N1 virus could promote HIV-1 RNA production by activating host transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways and T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-related pathways. The replication of HIV-1 latent infection could be reactivated by pH1N1 infection through TCR and apoptotic pathways. These data indicate that HIV-1 replication can be activated by pH1N1 virus in HIV-1-infected cells resulting in induction of cell death through apoptotic pathways.",

While HIV directly and selectively infects CD4+ T cells, the low levels of infected cells in patients is discordant with the rate of CD4+ T cell decline and argues against the role of direct infection in CD4 loss [15] . A viral protein, neuraminidase (NA), derived from the human influenza virus was reported to enhance the level of HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and HIV-1 replication [16, 17] . However, it is not known whether influenza A virus in blood affects HIV-1 replication, or reactivates HIV-1 replication in HIV-1-infected cells. Here, we showed that pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection increased apoptotic cell death and HIV-1 replication in HIV-1 infected Jurkat cells.",

As shown in Figure 2A , more DISC formation was found with the pH1N1/HIV-1 infection relative to HIV-1 infection or pH1N1 alone. Figure 2B showed that high level of expression of p53 and Bax proteins was detected in Jurkat cells infected with pH1N1 infection and HIV-1-infected cells, compared with pH1N1 or HIV-1 alone. These data indicate that pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection can induce both Fas-mediated and Bax-mediated apoptotic pathways.

It has been well-known that some host transcription factors are required for HIV replication, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), NFAT, AP-1, which are up-regulated when T-cells become activated [19] [20] [21] . They stimulate viral gene expression through transcription with the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 [22] .

Western blotting analysis showed that pH1N1 infection increased NFAT expression and activated NF-kB signaling ( Figure 5C ). pH1N1 infection could activate both apoptotic pathways with an increased expression of pre-apoptotic proteins (such as Fas, DISC formation, FADD, and Bax) and a decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (such as FLIP and Bcl-2) (Figure 6 ), suggesting that apoptotic pathways may be also involved in pH1N1-induced reactivation of HIV-1 replication.

It has been reported that pathogenesis due to influenza infections was associated with alterations in the lymphohematopoietic system, leading to the destruction of lymphocytes and histopathological necrosis of lymphoid tissues [33, 34] . There is little information available on whether and how influenza infection could damage the immune system directly and alter its ability to control other infectious pathogens that ultimately are detrimental to the host.

Distal lung epithelial cell apoptosis and apoptosis-resulting in necrosis were described as a classical feature of H5N1-or pandemic H1N1-induced ARDS [40] . Epithelial cell apoptosis is generally seen as a major underlying cause of diffuse alveolar damage in many forms of ARDS [40] . So far, it has been clear that influenza infection can affect both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways [18] . It was also reported that after influenza virus infection, some CD4+ cells in the spleen and thymus may express viral proteins [41] , and a population of T cells is susceptible to influenza A virus in infected mice [42, 43] . Influenza virus infection has been shown to activate TCR-signaling pathways in Jurkat cells [16] and pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection causes apoptotic death in HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells (Figures 4 and 5B,C) . Previously, we reported that pre-apoptotic molecules from apoptotic pathways increase HIV-1 replication, while anti-apoptotic proteins inhibit viral RNA yield [23] . Consistent with our previous observation, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection can increase HIV-1 replication with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic molecules, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, and with an increased activation of T cells through TCR-related signaling pathways ( Figures 1C, 2 and 6 ) required for T-cell activation and HIV-1 replication; however the detailed mechanisms by which pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection induces HIV-1 replication needs further study.",

Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is also able to reactivate HIV-1 replication from its state of latent infection through activating apoptosis and TCR-signaling pathways.",
