The accuracies were evaluated by comparing model forecasts to actual values with mean absolute percentage of error. Sensitivity of prediction errors to model training time was also evaluated. The ARIMA models indicated that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, non-trauma, and trauma visits may correlate positively with ED revenue, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with ED revenue. Moreover, mean minimum temperature and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature, relative humidity and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with non-trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature and relative humidity may correlate positively with pediatric visitor volume, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with pediatric visitor volume. The model also performed well in forecasting revenue and visitor volume.",

Although most medical organizations attempt to predict hourly or daily patient admissions, no studies have reported monthly forecasts of ED revenue, and very few have reported monthly forecasts of ED visitor volume. Moreover, no studies have simultaneously evaluated the possible associations of meteorological, clinical, and economic factors with ED revenue and visitor volume. Additionally, although the annual budget is a major consideration in hospital management, excellent care quality has the highest priority. Since ED medical services can easily incur large budget deficits, accurate revenue prediction provides the data needed to adjust budgets accordingly so that health care providers can allocate sufficient resources in advance. This study therefore analyzed the effects of 2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine meteorological, clinical, and economic factors on monthly ED revenue and visitor volume.",

Mean minimum temperature, accumulated rainfall, and stock index fluctuation were all positively correlated whereas mean maximum temperature and relative humidity correlated negatively with number of monthly trauma visits, with the lag time ranging from zero to two months. Table 3 shows the parameter estimates for the optimum ARIMA mode (1, 0, 0) for the series of monthly ED revenue. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the residuals showed a good data fit (data not shown). The residual plots showed small variations around the zero mean. In no case did the magnitude of these residuals exceed double the standard deviation. As a set, autocorrelations for residuals did not significantly differ from zero, and variance was consistent, which confirmed the adequacy of the model (Ljung-Box statistic = 22.04; P = 0.483). The analysis showed that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, accumulated rainfall, nontrauma visits, and trauma visits were significantly and positively related to ED revenue, but mean minimum temperature was significantly and negatively related to ED revenue (P < 0.05). Table 4 shows the parameter estimates for the optimal ARIMA modes for the series of trauma visits, nontrauma visits, and pediatric visits. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the residuals also showed good data fit (data not shown). Mean minimum temperature and stock index fluctuation were significantly and positively associated with number of trauma visits (P < 0.05). Moreover, mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, and fluctuation in stock index were significantly and positively associated with number of nontrauma visits (P < 0.05). Additionally, mean maximum temperature and relative humidity were significantly and positively associated with number of pediatric visits, but mean minimum temperature was significantly and negatively associated with number of pediatric visits (P < 0.05).

This study found that ED revenue correlated positively with mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, accumulated rainfall, number of trauma, and nontrauma visits, but negatively mean minimum temperature. Although rainfall was significantly associated with revenue, it was unassociated with volume of trauma, nontrauma, and pediatric patients. A possible explanation is that the severity of diseases treated at EDs increases during rainy season [12] . The number of health insurance claims during the study period was not significantly related to patient volume.",

The effects of meteorological conditions on specific diseases have already been demonstrated [15] . Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of meteorological conditions on all ED patients treated in one facility. In contrast with previous reports, mean minimum temperature was associated with number of trauma patients, and mean maximum temperature was associated with number of nontrauma patients [15, 16] . The effects of weather changes on residents in different regions may explain the difference [17] . Residents of tropical climates who are accustomed to warm temperatures may have low tolerance for cold temperatures. Thus, cold weather may cause people in tropical climates to hurry and drive less carefully. Driving at high speeds is another major cause of traffic accidents in Taiwan, especially those involving motorcycles. Hence, trauma-causing accidents may increase during cold weather in Taiwan. Wearing thin clothes on days with high temperatures may also contribute to the risk of motorcycle injuries [18] .",
