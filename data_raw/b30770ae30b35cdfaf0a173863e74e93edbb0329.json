            "text": "Introduction: A hallmark of sepsis is early onset microvascular dysfunction. However, the mechanism responsible for maldistribution of capillary blood flow is not understood. Evidence suggests red blood cells (RBC) can sense local oxygen (O2) conditions and signal the vasculature, via adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to increase capillary flow. We hypothesized that sepsis impaired microvascular autoregulation over the entire capillary network, within a capillary and within the RBC. Study objectives were to: 1) measure capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries (capillaries with RBC hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) < 20 %), 2) test the null hypothesis that sepsis had no effect on RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux and 3) develop a pathophysiological model. Methods: Hypotensive sepsis was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats using cecal ligation and perforation, with a 6-hour end point. Rat hindlimb skeletal muscle microcirculation was imaged using a dual wavelength spectrophotometric intravital microscopy system, and capillary RBC supply rate (SR = RBC/s), RBC SO2 and oxygen supply rate (qO2 = pLO2/s) were quantified. Arterial NOx (nitrite + nitrate) and RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux were measured using a nitric oxide (NO) analyzer and gas exchanger, respectively. Results: Compared to control, sepsis increased capillary stopped flow and plasma lactate (p < 0.05). Increased plasma NOx (p < 0.001) was related to increased capillary RBC SR (p = 0.027). Analysis of 30second capillary SR-SO2-qO2 profiles, revealed a shift towards decreased (p < 0.05) oxygen supply rates in some capillaries. Moreover, capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries (time to restore capillary RBC SO2 > 20 %) increased 3-4 fold (p < 0.05). And, consistent with impaired microvascular autoregulation, the RBC's response to a hypoxic environment, measured as RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux, decreased by 62.5 % (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Sepsis impaired microvascular autoregulation at the capillary and erythrocyte level. Impaired autoregulation was manifested by increased capillary stopped-flow, increased capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries, decreased capillary oxygen supply rate and decreased RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux. This loss of local microvascular control was partially off-set by increased capillary RBC supply rate, which correlated with increased plasma NOx.",

However, contradictory findings have been reported (2) and, therefore, further replication of these findings in different cohorts need to be performed. The purpose of this study is to assess the immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses levels, in a cohort of patients with influenza. Methods: We studied 137 Spanish patients who developed flu (80.3 % by H1N1pdm virus). Diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of Influenza virus in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Real-Time polymerase chain reaction. Immmunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (Binding Site Human IgG Subclass kits) were measured in both acute and convalescent phase and their correlation with severity was examined. We analyzed genetic variants at IGHG2 in order to evaluated their role in the IgG2 levels. Clinical and immunological characteristics were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test when needed. Results: Ninety-three patients were hospitalized and 49 required admission to intensive care unit. Sixty-four patients developed viral pneumonia and 26 acute respiratory distress syndrome. No differences in the serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM or IgG subclasses were observed in the different subgroups according to severity of disease. Genotype G2m n-/n-was associated with lower serum IgG2 levels in the convalescent phase. Patients homozygous for the G2m(n-) allele had significantly lower serum IgG2 levels (256.7 +/-121.3 mg/dL, N = 16) than individuals carrying the G2m(n-) allele (n+/n-and n-/n-genotypes, 334,5 +/-120,4 mg/dL, N = 31) (p = 0.042). However no association of IgG2m genotypes and severity of flu was observed. Conclusions: In our study we have not been able to replicate previously reported observations. IgG2 deficiency does not appear to be a significant risk factor for severity of flu.",

            "text": "Introduction: Neutrophil play an important role as the first line of innate immune defense. Activated neutrophils become segmented and cytoplasm grows larger including granules. However, sometimes it is difficult to diffentiate whether the segmented neutrophils are on the process to grow up or not, and to decide to stop antibiotics or not. There are some reports that hyper spectral imaging (HSI) is available for analysis including diagnosis of malaria infected cells and distinction of the cells to produce antibody. In this study, we evaluated serial changes of HSI spectrum in patients with infection, and examined whether we could distinguish activated neutrophils or not. Methods: Sputum and urine samples were collected from the clinically ill three patients with pulmonary infection(n = 2) and urinary tract infection(UTI; n = 1). These samples were smeared on glass slides and gram stain was conducted. We observed the slides with HSI to get the hyper spectral data 10 times from each cytoplasm of neutrophil, and analyzed hyper spectral data with the software system, MultiSpec\u00ae. Results: We could find that neutrophils have different spectrum in each infectious stage, especially during from 400 to 700 nm wavelength. Representative image of a patient with UTI was shown in Fig. 1 . When the neutrophils became segmented and had phagocytosis, the cytoplasm of neutrophil enlarged and showed strong intensity (black lines) compared to when microorganism disappeared and the size of cytoplasm decreased (blue and red lines). Conclusions: We could find the serial changes of spectrum of neutrophils during each infectious stage. HSI may be available to decide start or termination of antibiotics. Further study is required to establish the cut off intensity level of the activated neutrophils. Introduction: Recent studies have demonstrated that the endotoxin activity levels, which were analyzed using the Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA), correlated with the severity of sepsis in patients admitted to the ICU. On the other hand, there are several reports that they dispute the clinical utility of the EAA. We focused on chemiluminescent intensity (CI) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by EAA and evaluated the predictive value for the incidence of postoperative infectious complications following elective gastroenterological surgery.",

            "text": "Methods: Forty eight patients who underwent elective surgery for gastrointestinal cancer were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were taken on the previous day (before surgery), and on the first (POD1) and third postoperative days (POD3). All blood samples were analyzed using the EAA system. We focused on CI max, which is maximally stimulated with LPS and the minimum CI, which is only stimulated with opsonized zymosan. Results: Postoperative infectious complications occurred in 23 of the 48 patients. There were significant differences in the EA levels between patients who developed postoperative infectious complications and patients who did not on POD3. Minimum CI was significantly higher in the patients who developed postoperative infectious complications at all points compared to those from the patients who did not. In addition, the ratio of maximal CI to minimum CI, which reflects the neutrophil function against maximal LPS, was significantly lower before surgery and on POD1 in patients who developed postoperative infectious complications. Although a significant positive correlation was observed between the neutrophil counts and maximal CI or minimum CI, no correlation was observed between the neutrophil counts and the ratio of maximal CI to minimum CI. Conclusions: Chemiluminescent intensities, especially the ratio of maximal CI to minimum CI, could be an early predictive marker for the development of postoperative infectious complications. Introduction: C1 inhibitor (C1INH), belonging to the superfamily of serin protease inhibitors, regulates not only complement system, but also plasma kallikrein-kinin system, fibrinolytic system and coagulation system. The biologic activities of C1INH can be divided into the regulation of vascular permeability and anti-inflammatory functions. The objective of this study was to clarify the serial change in C1INH in patients with sepsis and evaluate the impact of C1INH on their clinical course. Methods: This study was a single center prospective observational study. We serially examined C1INH activity values (normal range 70-130 %) in patients with sepsis admitted into the intensive care unit of the Trauma and Acute Critical Care Center at Osaka University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) during the period between January 2014 and August 2015. We defined refractory shock as septic shock unresponsive to the conventional therapy such as adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy to maintain hemodynamics. Results: The serial change of C1INH was evaluated in 40 patients with sepsis (30 male and 10 female; 30 survivors and 10 non-survivor; mean age, 70+/-13.5 years). We divided patients into three groups such as (i) non-shock group (n = 14), (ii) non-refractory shock group (n = 13), (iii) refractory shock group (n = 13, survivors; n = 3, non survivors; n = 10). In non-shock group, C1INH were 107.3+/-26.5 % at admission and 104.2+/-22.3 % at day1, and it increased after day1 (128.1+/-26.4 % at day3, 138.3+/-21.2 % at day 7, 140.3+/-12.5 % at day 14)(p = 0.0040). In non-refractory shock group, C1INH were 113.9+/-19.2 % at admission and it increased after admission (120.2+/-23.0 % at day1, 135.7+/-19.9 % at day3, 138.8+/-17.2 % at day 7, 137.7+/-10.7 % at day 14)(p = 0.0029). In refractory shock group, C1INH were 96.7+/-15.9 % at admission and 88.9+/-22.3 % at day1 and it increased after day1 (119.8+/-39.6 % at day3, 144.4+/-21.1 % at day 7, 140.5+/-24.5 % at day 14)(p < 0.0001). The difference between these three groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0039). C1INH in nonsurvivors did not increase significantly during their clinical course (p = 0.0773). Conclusions: In refractory shock patients with sepsis, the values of C1INH were low (especially in non survivors) at admission and day 1. The validity of C1INH replacement therapy in patients with septic shock may lead to a new strategy for management in sepsis. Introduction: There is a lack of studies comparing the utility of Creactive protein (CRP) with procalcitonin (PCT) for the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in primary care. Our aim was to study first the correlation between these markers, and second to compare their predictive accuracy in regard to clinical outcome prediction. Methods: This is a secondary analysis using clinical and biomarker data of 458 primary care patients with pneumonic and nonpneumonic ARI. We used correlation statistics (spearman's rank test) and multivariable regression models to assess association of markers with adverse outcome, namely days with restricted activities and ongoing discomfort at day 14.",

            "text": "Conclusions: CRP and PCT levels do not well correlate and have both have moderate prognostic accuracy in primary care patients with ARI to predict clinical outcomes. The low correlation between both markers calls for interventional research comparing these markers head to head in regard to their ability to guide antibiotic decisions. Introduction: Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed as a helpful tool to guide treatment with antibiotics and to improve antibiotics stewardship. [1, 2, 3] However the cut off for the PCT level has not been agreed as different studies have suggested different thresholds to predict the need for antibiotics, these cut off points ranged from 0.25 ng/mL -1 ng/mL. In our hospital the reference range is set at 0.5 ng/mL. This study aimed at identifying the best PCT level to rule out sepsis. Methods: We have retrospectively reviewed 53 intensive care unit patients, who had serial PCT tests as part of their daily blood tests. Three serial readings of PCT were collected in addition to microbiology culture results and whether the patient met the definition criteria for sepsis as set out in the 2001 International Sepsis Definition conference. Results: Out of the 53 patients, 26 (49.05 %) patients had negative microbiological cultures with no evidence of sepsis. PCT test level of 0.13 ng/mL had 100 % sensitivity as no patient below this cut off had evidence of sepsis or positive microbiology culture. The Area under the ROC was 0.702 with 95 % Confidence interval of 0.56-0.84 and a p value of 0.012 (Fig. 3) . Conclusions: Using lower PCT cut off would further enhance the ability of PCT to rule out sepsis in the critically ill patient. Introduction: Central Nervous System (CNS) infections after neurosurgical procedures with extensively drug resistant bacteria (XDR), in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, is a life threatening complication requiring early identification and immediate action. Increased number of white blood cells (WBC), high temperature and circulating acute phase proteins are common in those patients making timely diagnosis challenging. We sought to investigate the reliability of serum C-Reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) to early identify and monitor CNS infections. Methods: From January 2013 to November 2015 all cases with CNS infections were recorded. Inclusion criteria were the presence of fever > 38.5oC and compatible lumbar puncture findings (increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, increased protein and low glucose compared to serum levels). The WBC, CRP and PCT levels before (when the inclusion criteria were met) and after the infection (last intrathecal administration of Collistin 300.000 IU, Amikacin 25 mg and Vancomycin 25 mg) were compared. Results: Twelve patients (mean age 45.7 \u00b1 18.1) were studied. WBC remained high before and after infection. Conversely, CRP values were statistically different before and after the infection whereas the PCT ones were not (Table 1) . Conclusions: Based on our findings CRP carries a better predictive value than PCT as biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of CNS infections in ICU. The small number of patients is a limitation for these results. Introduction: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide with 52 amino acids which has strong vasodilator activity. Elevated plasma ADM levels have been detected in a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions, with the highest elevations observed in septic shock. Marino et al. demonstrated a strong association of admission ADM levels with the severity of sepsis, supporting an earlier report describing elevated ADM levels in those with severe sepsis and those with septic shock [1] . By using a novel assay specific for bioactive ADM (bio-ADM) as Marino et al.the aim of the study was to assess the relation between ADM measured at admission and in-ICU mortality in consecutive patients regardless the cause of admission. Methods: The French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study was a multicenter observational study, including 2087 consecutive patients followed up to one year for those who survived to ICU stay. The protocol has previously been described [2] . Plasma were collected at admission for all patients and at discharge for in-ICU survivors. ADM was measured in all plasma using a sandwich assay specific for bio-ADM. The association between in-ICU mortality and the level of ADM was assessed by univariate analysis and adjusted analysis for severity at admission measured by the SAPS-II. Improvement in area under the ROC curve and reclassification indices were assessed. Results: 2087 patients have been included, 65 % male with a median age of 63 (51-74), a median Charlson score of 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) ",

Our objective was to describe the ability of Heparin-Binding Protein (HBP) to predict the development of septic shock relative to the PIRO score. Methods: Design: A secondary analysis of a multi-centered observational study. Inclusion: 1. adults >17 years with acute infection, 2. hospital admission and 3. two measurements of HBP. Exclusion: Hypotension within the first 12 hours. Initial PIRO scores calculated on arrival. Outcome: The development of delayed hypotension (dShock) = sBP <90 after initial assessment. Analysis: Subjects were grouped according to PIRO score range using previously defined cutoffs, and outcomes for each group were summarized. Average values and change in HBP were described across each group.",

Our aim was to investigate the potential prognostic role of this new marker on a cohort of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We prospectively included 148 patients admitted to the ICU with the suspected diagnosis of sepsis. Of these, 28 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. sCD14, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded at admission ICU day 1 and ICU day 3.

Analytical sensitivity of the test is inferior to the mean PSP/reg value of a cohort of healthy individuals and the test is linear up to 1000 ng/ml of PSP/reg, thereby meeting clinical requirements. In a small-size comparison study, a good agreement was observed for PSP/reg values measured in microtiter ELISA and in the abioSCOPE. Conclusions: The analytical performances of the PSP/reg test in nanofluidic biosensors highlight that rapid and accurate quantitative measurement of low abundance proteins can be achieved at no quality costs. More data is however needed to better evaluate the diagnostic performance of PSP/reg in various settings. Quantification of PSP/reg in 5 minutes in the abioSCOPE, together with the evaluation of other specific clinical signs performed at the bedside, will hopefully improve the decision-making process of patient with suspected sepsis and improve patient's management in various clinical scenarios. Introduction: Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality in intensive care units and its incidence is increasing along with the antibiotic resistance of the causing microorganisms. The management of sepsis is technically demanding and costly with only few therapeutic options available. Prompt diagnosis and hence early treatment has a major impact on patient survival. The advent of nanotechnology has brought with it an astonishing number of novel tools enabling novel technological solutions [1] .

Expression levels of IL7R variants were measured using appropriate RT-qPCR designs: one specific of the variant encoding the membrane form of IL-7R, one specific of a variant corresponding to a potential soluble form and one covering all known splicing variants, including the 2 mentioned previously. Expression levels of these variants were described according to time and compared to 19 healthy volunteers. The association between our candidate biomarkers and day 28 status was assessed by logistic regression analyses. ROC curves were performed in order to evaluate performances. Results: We noticed a decrease of expression levels of all IL7R splicing variants in patients compared to controls. An association between mortality and IL7R decreased expression was found for measurements at D3 and the ratio of expression D3/D1. This association was observed whatever the transcription variant used, in particular at D3 for the membrane form and for the potential soluble form of IL7R (OR = 0. Conclusions: This work put in highlight a marked decreased expression level of all IL7R splicing variants studied during septic shock. Persistence of lower expression on D3 was associated with higher mortality. The quantification of the expression of IL7R could provide an interesting biomarker to identify the most seriously ill patients who could benefit from new immunotherapies.",

Data were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi-square test Pearson's correlation coefficient (IBM SPSS Statistics 22). Results: It is noted that phenylpropionic acid (PPA) disappeared in critical ill patients while always present in healthy.

Introduction: It is well recognised that coagulation is altered across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). This can range from an increased thrombotic risk to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have attempted to investigate these changes in coagulation using standard and global markers of coagulation [1] ; however, clot microstructure has not been investigated. Recent research has led to the development of a new biomarker of clot microstructure, Df, which quantifies the fibrin network of the incipient clot [2] . This study aims to investigate the role of clot microstructure in sepsis, by using new quantitative biomarker of clot microstructure, Df. Methods: This study had full ethical approval from the South West Wales Research Ethics Committee. Patients with a diagnosis of sepsis were recruited from the Emergency Department (ED) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a large teaching hospital in South Wales. Blood samples were taken to determine Df, full blood count and standard coagulation screen. A healthy control group matched for age and gender was also recruited. Results: 95 patients were included in the study: 49 with sepsis, 19 with severe sepsis and 27 with septic shock. 44 healthy volunteers were recruited as a matched control. Mean Df in the healthy control group was 1.74 \u00b1 0.03. Mean Df in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis was significantly higher (1.78 \u00b1 0.07 and 1.80 \u00b1 0.05 respectively (p < 0.05, One-way ANOVA Post-hoc Bonferroni correction)). Mean Df in patients with septic shock was significantly lower compared to all other groups (1.66 \u00b1 0.10 (p < 0.001, One-way ANOVA Post-hoc Bonferroni correction)). Df was also significantly lower in non-survivors than survivors at 28 days (1.66 \u00b1 0.13 vs 1.76 \u00b1 0.08, p = 0.006 (Students t-test)).",

            "text": "Our results indicate that patients with sepsis and severe sepsis form tight highly branched fibrin clots (as indicated by high Df). As the disease progresses to septic shock, much weaker clots are formed (as indicated by low Df). This may help to explain the dichotomy of thrombogenicity and bleeding diathesis in patients across the sepsis spectrum. The new functional biomarker, fractal dimension (Df), therefore can be used to quantify clot microstructure across the sepsis spectrum. It can also be used as an outcome measure, although this study was not powered for outcome. Introduction: It is well recognised that coagulation is altered across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). Sepsis is recognised to be a prothrombotic state, due to an increased procoagulant activity and impairment of the natural anticoagulants and fibrinolytic proteins [1] . Altered fibrinolysis could have a key role in the accumulation of microthrombi leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The aim of this study was to assess the changes in fibrinolysis across the sepsis spectrum using the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) lysis index (LI60) and D-dimer concentration. Conclusions: Fibrinolytic activity was increased in patients with septic shock. However there was an impairment of the fibrinolytic function as measured by ROTEM. The exact mechanisms leading to this are not fully understood, however consumption of fibrinolytic factors could contribute as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer concentration. ROTEM lysis index (LI60) can potentially be used as a biomarker to identify septic shock and as an outcome measure, although this study was not powered for outcome. Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted at an academic medical center and a community hospital in Utah. Adults admitted to ICUs fulfilled SIRS criteria. The attending physician and a study investigator classified patients at admission as sepsis, SIRS, or indeterminate. The reference diagnosis was determined through independent review of all clinical data at discharge by two study physicians with adjudication by a third for discordant classifications. Inter-physician admission classifications at admission and discharge were compared. Results: Of the 210 enrolled subjects, 58 (28 %) cases had at least one physician classify the patient as indeterminate, and in 9 (4 %) there was major disagreement with the classifications of SIRS and sepsis. At discharge, in 46 (22 %) cases, at least one classification was indeterminate and in 4 (2 %) there was major disagreement between classification of SIRS and sepsis. When compared to discharge classification (Fig. 7) , 142 (68 %) cases initially classed as SIRS or sepsis by the attending physician remained unchanged. Of 89 patients initially diagnosed with sepsis on admission, 66 (74 %) were deemed to be correct, 8 (9 %) were deemed SIRS and 15 (17 %) indeterminate when compared to discharge classification. Of the 40 (19 %) subjects indeterminate on admission, 12 (30 %) remained so at discharge. 19 patients initially diagnosed with sepsis or SIRS became indeterminate at discharge. One patient initially classed as SIRS and 11 as indeterminate were ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of sepsis. Conclusions: Considerable uncertainty exists with use of clinical criteria for sepsis in ICU patients. Accurate tests that improve early diagnostic accuracy are needed in the management of critically ill patients. Introduction: Temperature measurement is an essential component for decision making on intensive care both in the context of identifying and treating sepsis and also in accurate calibration of blood gas analysis. SpotOn\u2122 a Zero Heat Flux Cutaneous thermometer has been validated as a non-invasive, continuous and accurate method of measuring temperature in patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the operative and peri-operative period. 1 We compared SpotOn\u2122 with Axilla thermometers, our current method of non-invasive temperature monitoring, to establish how inaccurate our current practice was. Methods: 25 acute patients were selected on admission to intensive care at Lewisham Hospital, 17 male, 18 female, 16 medical and 9 surgical. Temperatures were recorded for an average of 47 hours on each patient using Covidien Fillac\u2122 Axilla probes and SpotOn\u2122 forehead probes as and when our current clinical practice indicated.",

In the first 12 months the care of over 9500 patients with infection was examined. Methods: A panel of clinical experts developed a sepsis measure set with the aid of BMJ evidence & identified a study population using 25 ICD10 sepsis codes. Patients with a sepsis code on discharge had their initial care examined against a series of evidence-based interventions. An Appropriate Care Score (ACS) measured compliance with the sepsis care measure set. The project is promoted by an ongoing series of collaborative events, where performance is published & best practice is shared. A healthy sense of competition drives improvement in performance & commissioners are able to monitor performance in their locality. Results: Figure 8 shows the increase in ICD-10 coding in AQ participating trusts in the region vs Non AQ participating trusts.

Hyperthermia is initiated by the action of IL-1\u03b2 at organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, where prostaglandin E2 is released.

The purpose of this study was to assess the anti-pyretic effects of Ortogel when compared to Acetaminophen administration in Intensive Care patients. Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted in our Intensive Care Unit of the Clinical Emergency Hospital in Bucharest from January to June 2015. It included a total of 70 patients, divided in two equal groups, suffering from fever of infectious cause (cutaneous temperature of 38-39 degrees Celsius, measured using Nihon KOHDEN BSM 6000 monitor, in controlled room temperature). Hemodynamically unstable patients were excluded. The study group received 30 ml gel (Ortogel) with cutaneous administration while the control group received 1 g iv acetaminophen. Primary outcomes were difference in cutaneous temperature after 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h from the baseline reading. Results: Initially, the average temperature for the Ortogel group was 39.5 \u00b1 0.11 degrees Celsius, with similar values in the control group (39.0 \u00b1 0.14).

Introduction: Hypothermia is associated with adverse outcome in patients with sepsis. Knowledge on the pathophysiology is highly limited. The objective of this study was to establish whether hypothermia was associated with differences in the systemic host response to sepsis as reflected by cytokine profile, endothelial activation markers and cellular responsiveness towards lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the first days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: A prospective observational study in patients with sepsis on ICUs of 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Hypothermia was defined as the lowest body temperature measurement below 36\u00b0C in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were immunodeficiency, active cooling, readmission or admission from operating theatre or other ICU. Logistic regression was used to investigate the independent association of hypothermia with 90-day mortality. Plasma levels of endothelial markers and cytokine levels were measured upon ICU admission and at days 2 and 4 thereafter in all hypothermic and nonhypothermic patients with sepsis. Analyses were performed in the entire cohort as well as a cohort matched for disease severity. LPS ex vivo whole blood stimulation was performed on day 1 of admission in a subset of patients. Results: Hypothermia was identified in 186 of 525 patients and was independently associated with increased mortality in multivariate analysis. At baseline, patients with hypothermic sepsis were significantly older, had a lower body mass index and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Levels of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not different between groups at all time points. Hypothermia was also not associated with an altered response to ex vivo stimulation with LPS in a subset of patients. Hypothermia was associated with sustained elevated levels of the endothelial activation marker fractalkine during the first 4 days of ICU stay compared to nonhypothermic patients in both the entire cohort and the cohort matched for disease severity. Conclusions: Hypothermic sepsis is associated with increased mortality. Patients with hypothermia showed increased levels of fractalkine, irrespective of disease severity during the first 4 days of ICU stay.

Methods: 1384 patients admitted were reviewed over CIS (Metavision, iMDsoft) in Bakirkoy Dr.Sadi Konuk.An early warning was protocolized in the system relevant to international guidelines.Septic shock alert was activated if the condition as per \"> = 2 systemic inflamatory response syndrome(SIRS) criteria together with SBP < 90 mmHg\" was established.Patients were categorized into 3 based on intervals between first alert activation and initial response as per orders for diagnostics and interventions. Group I assigned for \"early acknowledgement and response within 10 minutes after alert\", Group II as \"response within 10-60 minutes after\" and Group III as \"late response after >60 minutes\". First acknowledgement of the alert, SOFA and APACHE 2 scores; and patient outcomes were analysed. Results: 165 patients recieved alert, however only 33 were diagnozed with sepsis/septic shock on admission, on the other hand, later in course of disease, 112 patients were confirmed to have sepsis. Group I had the lowest mortality compared to others (Table 4) . Conclusions: CIS helps in early recognition and intervention of critical disease, thus has an impact in decreasing mortality.In order to further decrease mortality, training is needed to increase compliance to the alert systems.However, septic shock alert protocolized over SIRS criteria seems to lead false positive diagnosis in one third of patients.This reveals the need for revising the sepsis and septic shock definition.",

Patients were defined to have a previous prescription of \u03b2 -blockers if the prescription was active for the 3 months prior to hospital admission. Results: We identified 4,629 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, 623 of whom had a previous prescription for \u03b2 -blockers before hospital admission and 4006 of whom were not previously taking \u03b2 -blockers. Common medications used by patients were metoprolol (77 %) and carvedilol (13 %). The overall mortality rate was 30 %. Among patients who were previously taking \u03b2 -blockers, 181 (29.1 %) died in the ICU and 442 (70.9 %) were discharged alive. Of the patients who did not have a previous prescription for \u03b2 -blockers, 1,231 (30.7 %) died in the ICU and 2,775 (69.3 %) were discharged alive. There was no statistically significant association between patients having a previous prescription for \u03b2 -blockers and ICU mortality (risk ratio 0.94; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.08; p = .39). We further stratified patients on the basis of highest heart rate in the first 24 hours of ICU admission into those with a heart rate >95 beats per minute and those with a heart rate of < =95 beats per minute. There were no statistically significant association between patients who had a previous prescription for \u03b2 -blockers and ICU mortality in either group (risk ratio 0.91; 95 % CI 0.77 to 1.06; p = 0.22) and (risk ratio 1.095; 95 % CI 0.78 to 0.1.54; p = 0.60) respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated no significant association between previous prescription for \u03b2 -blockers and ICU mortality. This held true even after further stratification of patients on the basis of highest heart rate in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. This result may be due to lack of effect of \u03b2 -blockers or short-term action of medication use. Introduction: The UK Sepsis Trust aims to raise awareness of sepsis and recommends an evidence based treatment bundle for severe sepsis known as 'The Sepsis Six' [1, 2] . An audit was completed on the Obstetric units of Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, UK. We wanted to assess the impact of teaching and posters on improving knowledge. Methods: We gave an anonymous questionnaire to maternity staff to assess baseline knowledge. This tested respondent's on the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and their knowledge of the 'Sepsis Six' treatment bundle for severe sepsis [1] . Our interventions consisted of 1:1 teaching and the provision of an information poster. A re-audit was performed in the same units a week later. Results: We initially audited 33 maternity staff and re-audited 27. Those re-audited reported that all staff had received 1:1 teaching and 96 % had seen the leaflet or poster. SIRS: Initially, 82 % had heard of SIRS, could name on average of only 1.5/6 criteria and only 58 % knew 2 criteria were needed for the diagnosis. This improved to 100 %, 5.2/6 and 81 % respectively. SEPSIS: 52 % could correctly define sepsis, only 3 % could define severe sepsis with staff able to name on average only 0.8 of the severe sepsis criteria. Their knowledge also improved to 70 %, 63 % and 2.4 respectively. SEPSIS 6 MANAGEMENT: Staff knew 4.8/6 of the Sepsis Six steps for management and 88 % knew it was required within an hour. There was a slight improvement to 5.5/6 for management and a surprising decrease in initiation of treatment to 85 %. Conclusions: Our maternity staff were initially aware of SIRS and Sepsis and simple interventions required to diagnose and treat patients, however their baseline knowledge of details in diagnosis and management was poor. We demonstrated that simple interventions such as 1:1 teaching, a poster and readily available leaflet can dramatically improve knowledge. Introduction: There is paucity of data concerning the group of patients with a clinical syndrome of sepsis, suspected clinical infection and negative cultures regarding disease severity, end organ failure and outcomes. It is also not clear whether patients with only negative blood cultures (BCs) but other positive cultures have a different disease entity than patients who have no growth in all of the cultures taken. Our study attempts to further define true culture negativity and its effect on disease severity and outcomes. Methods: All blood cultures results taken in the Detroit Medical Center ICUs from December 2012 to March 2013 were collected. Any patient who had a negative BC was reviewed. All cultures taken within 10 days of the negative BCs were further reviewed. Patients were then divided into 3 groups: 1.BC positive group-BCs within 10 days of the negative BC were positive. 2. Non BC positive group -other cultures within 10 days of the negative BC were positive. 3. All culture negative. The 3 groups were compared. Results: During the study period, 300 patients had at least one negative blood culture. 132 had all cultures negative, 76 had positive BCs, and 92 had other positive cultures. The BC positive group resembled the negative group in all baseline characteristics. There was a significant difference in the admission scores, with higher SOFA and APA-CHE2 scores of the BC positive group. SOFA score was higher for the positive group throughout the ICU stay. There was no difference in SIRS in both groups. However, there was more shock, need for vasopressors, renal failure, respiratory failure and neurological alterations in the BC positive group. The BC positive group was more frequently started on antibiotics and had more antibiotic days then the negative group. They also had worse outcomes with a higher mortality in the ICU (40 % in the positive vs. 6.8 % in the negative, p < 0.0001) and in the hospital (47.4 % vs. 9.9 % respectively, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of ICU death predictors, the only independent predictors were APACHE2 > 25 and positive BC group. Disease severity was also worse in non-blood positive culture group when compared with the negative group; scores were higher, there was more end organ dysfunction, antibiotic treatment was longer and Outcomes were worse. Conclusions: We have shown that the culture negative patients have lower disease severity, end organ failure and better outcomes, and therefore should be considered for shorter antimicrobial treatments and early de-escalation. Culture positivity indicate worse prognosis even for non BCs. Introduction: In administrative data, severe sepsis cases can be identified by different ICD code abstraction strategies. Comparing those strategies, there is a substantial variability in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis depending on the codes used. To understand which mechanisms depend the precision of case identification, we aimed to investigate coding of organ dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis hospitalized in Germany between 2007-2013 comparing administrative coding with prospective data from a national cohort study. Methods: Severe sepsis patients (>18 y) were identified in a nationwide database of hospital discharge data (DRG statistics) using ICD-10 codes for I) sepsis + organ dysfunction (explicit coding strategy) and II) infection + organ dysfunction (implicit coding strategy). Explicit sepsis codes included 26 ICD-codes. Infection codes were adapted from Angus et al. (2001, Crit Care Med) . Organ dysfunctions were identified by 27 organ failure codes. Septic shock was defined by code R57.2, introduced in 2010. Comparative organ dysfunction data was extracted from a German ICU cohort study (1) . Results: Between 2007-2013, we identified I) 941 957 severe sepsis patients using explicit and II) 4 785 511 severe sepsis patients using implicit coding strategies, including 18,2 % and 3,5 % of patients with septic shock, respectively (112 787 patients 2010-2013). Respiratory failure was the leading organ dysfunction coded (56,4 % of explicitly vs. 59,6 % of implicitly identified cases). Renal failure was identified more often when using explicit coding strategies (44,7 % vs. 26,5 %). This was also true for coagulopathy (23,5 % vs. 12,5 %) and metabolic alterations (13,1 vs. 6,1 %). Hypotension was coded in 18,7 % (explicit) and 5,1 % (implicit) of cases. Compared to a prospective cohort of ICU patients with severe sepsis, distribution of organ dysfunctions was similar to the one identified by explicit coding strategies (respiratory failure: 52 %, renal failure: 42,2 %, encephalopathy: 27,7 %, coagulopathy: 22,2 %, metabolic acidosis: 17,8 %, septic shock 50,8 %).",

Hypotension and the direct code for septic shock is coded in a similar percentage of patients, but in much fewer cases compared to a prospective cohort study of ICU patients. The quality of organ dysfunction coding has substantial influence on the accuracy of coding strategies for severe sepsis in administrative data and therefore requires further evaluation. Introduction: There were improvements in the knowledge about sepsis care and also well-established guidelines. However, the morbidity and mortality of septic patients remains unacceptably high. Our objective is to evaluate the knowledge of residents in different departments regarding the; Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2012. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study via a 15 question, questionnaire which was distributed to residents in Songklnagarind hospital, a-tertiary referral university teaching hospital in southern Thailand. The interns as well as, the training residents in the Department of Internal medicine, Surgery and Emergency medicine were included in our study. Results: The response rate was 136 (89 %) from 153 residents. The residents included 46 (33 %) interns, 42 (30 %) internal medicine residents, 41 (30 %) surgical residents and 7 (5 %) emergency residents.",

Only 77 (51 %) residents would measure blood lactate in sepsis patients, and there is no difference in overall knowledge about lactate measurement and interpretation between, internal medicine residents compared with other residents. In fluid resuscitation, all residents (95.6 %) chose normal saline solution as their first choice. However, in respects to the dose of fluid resuscitation, only 28 (20.5 %) residents gave the recommended fluid bolus (30 mL/kg) and internal medicine residents had a higher percentage of correct answer than surgical residents (28.6 % vs.7.32 %, P = 0.01). One hundred and fifteen (85 %) residents and 123 (90 %) residents used appropriate target mean arterial pressure and vasopressors, respectively. Most residents could give antimicrobial agents (73.5 %) and steroid (93.4 %) appropriately in patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, only half of the residents knew the target range of blood sugar control in sepsis patients, and internal medicine residents have a better knowledge than the other residents Conclusions: Our residents' knowledge about SSC 2012 is not satisfactory. Teaching couple with the learning process of sepsis management should be further provided. Because, an improvement in knowledge will surely decrease morbidity and mortality in sepsis patients.",

            "text": "Introduction: The formation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign in 2002 [1] led to the introduction of various sepsis management bundles, with evidence of improved outcome [2] . In 2014 our ICU introduced a quality improvement project to implement our septic shock bundle, encompassing early central line insertion, dynamic fluid boluses, mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg, measuring central venous oxygen saturations, blood cultures and antibiotics. We aimed to investigate if the introduction of the bundle was associated with improved patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective search of the WardWatcher TM database identified patients admitted to our ICU with septic shock, from 2009-2011 (Group 1) and after introduction of the quality improvement bundle from 2014-2015 (Group 2). Patients with a significant underlying renal or vascular diagnosis were excluded. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores (APACHE II) and outcome measures including length of ICU stay, duration of cardiovascular support, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and ICU survival were noted. Results: A total of 171 patients were included; 88 patients in group 1 and 83 in group 2. Median compliance with all aspects of the bundle was 60 % for group 2. Mortality was 43.6 % in group 1 compared to 38.6 % in group 2 (p = 0.64). Median APACHE II scores were similar and duration of cardiovascular support was not significantly different between the two groups. Length of ICU stay (median [interquartile range]) was longer in group 2 at 6 days [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] compared to 3 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] (p < 0.001) however this significance was lost when non-survivors were excluded. There was a significantly lower requirement for RRT amongst ICU survivors in group 2 at 15.7 % compared to 34 % (p = 0.0078). Conclusions: We have shown a significant improvement in rate of RRT associated with implementation of our sepsis resuscitation bundle. Whilst implementation of care bundles has been associated with improved patient outcome, the basis of this relationship remains unclear [2] . Our work fails to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality however we acknowledge the limitations of a small sample size. Median bundle compliance is higher than in other published work [2] however ongoing quality improvement work may increase this further. We identified a longer length of stay in group 2. This may represent either a longer period of treatment before deciding to change the focus of care to palliation or a faster decline in patients within group 1.",

            "text": "Introduction: Vasopressor therapy is required to sustain life and maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension occurring with severe sepsis and septic shock, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. [1] We hypothesized that a dose of norepinephrine administered in the first 24 hours correlates with the outcome of treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We analysed a total of 632 consecutive patients with septic shock (sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation) from the EPOSS database (Data-based Evaluation and Prediction of Outcome in Severe Sepsis), which was developed to monitor and assess the treatment efficacy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients were admitted to participating intensive care units (twelve hospitalsseventeen high-volume care units) in the Czech Republic from 1st of January 2011 to 5th of November 2013. The patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 316) and nonsurvivors (n = 316). Introduction: Low-dose vasopressin (VP) recently emerged as a promising therapy for septic shock [1] . The rationale for its use is the relative VP deficiency in patients with septic shock and VP ability to restore vascular tone and blood pressure, reducing the need for cathecolamines [2] ; however VP outcome effects in septic patients remain unclear [3] [4] . Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to our general ICU for septic shock in the last 23 months (between 1/2014 and 11/2015) and treated with Norepinephrine (NE) or with the association NE + VP. Patients were treated with NE after adequate fluid expansion. VP was added (0.02-0.03U/min) in case of MAP < 60 mmHg with NE dosage > = 0,4mcg/kg/min. We analyzed severity scores and plasma lactates at ICU admission, mortality in ICU, urinary output during the first 24 hours of vasopressor and need for RRT during ICU stay. Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square tests were used for statistical analysis.",

            "text": "Results: 39 patients were enrolled, 15 patients received NE + VP (NV group), 24 received NE (NE group). Overall mortality rate was 46.1 %: 53.3 % in NV and 42 % in NE group respectively (p = 0,47). The need of RRT was greater in NV than in NE group (40vs20%, p = 0,19). Urinary output in the first 24 hours of vasopressor was lower in NV group (0,7vs1 ml/kg/h, p = 0,47). NV group patients had more severe haemodynamic impairment and also worse severity score (SOFA = 11,8vs9,9; p = 0,03), worse renal function (AKIN 3vs2) at ICU admission and higher plasma lactates levels (3,9vs3,6; p = 0,39) NV group had greater incidence of thrombocytopenia (105vs207, p = 0,03). Conclusions: We didn't find any statistically significant difference between NV and NE groups in ICU mortality, despite NV had a significantly higher predicted mortality according to the SOFA. Renal function impairment wasn't significantly different in the two groups. The greater incidence of thrombocytopenia (p = 0.03) observed in NV group is in line with other studies. Introduction: Generalized vasodilation with nonresponding hypotension is present in half death cases due to septicaemia. Methylene blue could be used as a valuable complement in refractory hypotension treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of methylene blue as contributory treatment in patients with septic shock Methods: A controlled, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial was performed. 60 patients were divided in two groups. A Group received a single dose of methylene blue calculated 2 mg/kg per body weight diluted in 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. and C Group, (control) received 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. Basal measurements of study variables were taken (MBP, lactate, base deficit, central venous saturation and CO2 delta) prior blue methylene administration and every hour afterwards, until MBP >65 mmHg without vasopressor or 72 hours passed after shock began. Data about total noradrenaline dose in mg, length of stay, mechanical ventilation length and mortality was recorded Results: MBP increased progressively first 6 hours after methylene blue infusion in A Group 22 % and C Group 9.2 % (p:< 0.05), steadily until 72 hour follow up. Noradrenaline dose decreased in the first 6 hours, on A Group an 86 %, C Group was 56 % (p:<0.05). Lactate clearance first 6 hours was 62 % in A Group, in contrast with C Group with 33 % clearance (p:<0.05). Mortality at ICU discharge on A Group was 20.0 % and C Group was 36.6 % (p: <0.05) without variation at 21 days Conclusions: Methylene blue is effective as contributory in septic shock treatment. Introduction: Coagulation disorders are common in septic patients and constitute a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the ICU. The excessive activation of coagulation involves consumption of coagulation factors and platelets which may even lead to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In the present study we investigated the usefulness of the thromboelastometry method for bedside monitoring of coagulation abnormalities in patients with DIC treated at the ICU. Methods: In the observational study, patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis and overt DIC on admission to the ICU were included. DIC was recognized using a scoring system based on the criteria proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis [1] . The results of thromboelastometry tests (ROTEM) performed on the day of admission (day 1) and then daily for the next 3 days were Results: Among 51 patients admitted with severe sepsis, 16 (31 %) had a diagnosis of overt DIC. Out of 16 DIC patients, 5 patients died (NS; DIC score 5 \u00b1 0.4, 6 \u00b1 1.0, 5 \u00b1 0.0, and 6 \u00b1 0.0 points on day 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 11 survived (S; DIC score 5 \u00b1 0.4, 4 \u00b1 1.2, 4 \u00b1 2.1, and 3 \u00b1 1.8 points). On admission, major coagulation abnormalities identified by thromboelastometry, indicating a hypocoagulable pattern of abnormalities, were recorded for patients who did not survive: increased CT (p = 0.005 in EXTEM; p = 0.51 in INTEM) and CFT (p = 0.02 in EXTEM; 0.05 in INTEM), a lower alpha angle (p = 0.008 in EXTEM; p = 0.02 in INTEM), and decreased MCF (p = 0.03 in EXTEM; p = 0.31 in INTEM), in comparison to the results recorded for survivors. Differences in thromboelastometry parameters for groups of NS and S were also observed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th days. Fibrinolysis was inhibited in nonsurvivors (LI 60 = 100 % and ML = 0 % in both EXTEM and INTEM) during the entire time of observation. Conclusions: Thromboelastometry used as a point-of-care assay made it possible to accurately monitor patients with DIC. The presence of coagulation disorders indicated by thromboelastometry identifies a high-risk subpopulation of critically ill patients. Introduction: The frequency of early (within the first three days of onset) sepsis-associated coagulopathy (SAC) and its association with clinical outcomes varies depending on the definition(s) of coagulopathy. Furthermore, the frequency of SAC may have decreased with more effective use of sepsis bundles (early antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors). Accordingly, we sought to determine the frequency and outcome of early SAC. Methods: We reviewed all patients admitted to the medical-surgical ICU of St. Paul's Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Vancouver, Canada from January 2011 to July 2013. We included patients who met SAC inclusion criteria: sepsis and platelet count less than 150,000 (or a decrease of at least 30 %) and INR greater than 1.2 within the first three days of onset of sepsis. We assessed the presence and severity of SAC and the association of SAC with hospital mortality and need for vasopressors, ventilation and renal replacement therapy (RRT). ) in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Increasing severity of the combination of abnormal INR and platelets was associated with significantly higher mortality and greater need for vasopressors and RRT but not ventilation. Increasingly abnormal INR was associated with increasing mortality in a monotonic, increasing fashion whereas only severe thrombocytopenia (platelets (<80,000) was associated with significantly increased mortality. Conclusions: SAC is common (20 -35 % of septic patients) and is associated with increased mortality and need for vasopressors, ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Accordingly, there is a need for therapies that decrease the severity of SAC to attempt to decrease mortality and organ dysfunction in sepsis. Introduction: Hypercoagulability has been described both in cancer patients and also in sepsis, leading to microcirculatory failure and organ dysfunction in the latter. However, this is often overlooked by standard coagulation tests (SCTs).The aim of this pilot study was to compare hemostasis in cancer patients in the early stage of severe sepsis/septic shock to cancer patients without sepsis Methods: Adult patients operated for solid tumors (in the first 30 days after surgery) admitted in the ICU with severe sepsis/septic shock were included in the study group (SG). Patients scheduled for elective surgery due to intra-abdominal or pelvic malignancies were included in the control group (CG). Exclusion criteria were: liver diseases, chronic kidney failure, hematologic diseases, pregnancy, chronic anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy and blood derivates or procoagulant treatments in the last 7 days. In both groups SCTs, plasma levels of coagulation factors and rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM\u00ae, Germany) were determined in the first 24-36 hours after admission in the ICU (SG) and just before surgery in the CG. The following indices were calculated from the first derivative of the clot firmness curve: Maximum Velocity (MaxVel), Time to Maximum Velocity of clot formation (t-MaxVel) and area under the curve (AUC) [1] . Results: After Ethics Committee approval, 32 patients in the SG and 26 patients in the CG were included. Patients in the SG had lower platelet number (p = 0.001), prolonged SCTs (p < 0.001 for PT and aPTT) and lower II,V, VII, X, protein C, S (p < 0.001) and antithrombin III(p = 0.015) levels. In the SG, ROTEM showed delayed activation of hemostasis, prolonged clotting times (p < 0.001) and increased t-MaxVel (p = 0.001). But clot formation was similar in both groups with non-significant differences in maximum clot firmness (MCF), MaxVel and AUC. In the SG patients with APACHEII > =25 had higher MCF (p = 0.026) and AUC (p = 0.003) as compared to patients with APACHE < 25. Conclusions: Our study showed that cancer patients with severe sepsis/septic shock had similar hypercoagulability after a delayed clot initiation as compared to cancer patients without sepsis, despite thrombocytopenia and prolonged SCTs. These abnormalities were only detected by dynamic hemostasis measurements but not with SCTs. For firm conclusions the completion of this pilot study is required. Introduction: DIC has a high prevalence among the critically ill, but a specific diagnostic test is lacking. We aimed to assess whether ROTEM is of additional value to discriminate patients with and without DIC and whether it correlates with conventional and experimental markers/tests of DIC. Methods: In ICU patients with a coagulopathy (INR 1.5-3.0), DIC was defined as a score of > = 5 points on the ISTH DIC score scale. Concomitantly with conventional coagulation tests (INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer and platelet count) ROTEM was performed. In addition, levels of coagulation factors II, V and VII, antithrombin, protein C activity and protein S were determined. Statistics by Mann Whitney and Spearman's rho. Results: 23 patients were included of which 13 had overt DIC, the majority was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis. Patients with DIC had lower platelet count and lower levels of fibrinogen, factors II, VII and VIII compared to patients without DIC. Endogenous anticoagulants; antithrombin, protein C and S were also reduced in DIC patients. Thromboelastometry profiles were more hypocoagulable in DIC patients compared to those without DIC: EXTEM CFT: 183 (Table 5) . Conclusions: In ICU patients with DIC, ROTEM showed hypocoagulable profiles and correlated with DIC score and low levels of endogenous anticoagulants. Thereby, ROTEM may be a useful tool in diagnosing DIC in the critically ill.",

            "text": "Cessation of a preexisting chronic antiplatelet therapy is associated with increased mortality rates in severe sepsis and septic shock Introduction: A prior use of antiplatelet agents was associated with a survival benefit in sepsis [1, 2] . But it remains unclear, if chronic antiplatelet therapy should be continued or not during severe sepsis and septic shock. In addition, the subsequent need of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with continued chronic antiplatelet therapy remains to be determined. We hypothesized that the continuation of a preexisting antiplatelet medication (aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) during sepsis therapy reduces mortality rates of severe sepsis and septic shock without increasing RBC transfusions. Methods: We performed a retrospective, single-center cohort study of intensive care (ICU) patients with severe sepsis or septic shock at the University Hospital of Greifswald, Germany, from January 2010 to December 2013. The local ethics committee approved the study (Identifier: BB 133/10) and waived a written informed consent because of the anonymous data collection and the quality saving and observing character of the study. The administration of antiplatelet agents before and during ICU stay, the number of transfused RBC concentrates and mortality rates up to 90 days were registered. Categorical data are represented as percentages and counts. Results: Patients whose preexisting antiplatelet therapy was continued showed increased mortality rates in contrast to patients whose medication was discontinued. The Introduction: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are one of the immune systems to suppress dissemination of infection by the netted chromatin decorated with antibacterial molecules. We reported that NETs were not observed in the abscess, but a lot of NETs appeared after abscess drainage. Since closed wound area is known to be hypoxic, we hypothesized that NETs production was affected by the concentration of oxygen. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and neutrophils were purified and stimulated with PMA. Incubation was performed for 4 hours in a CO[sub]2[/sub] incubator or in a box with oxygen scavenger. The specimens were stained with SYTOX Orange and examined by immunohistochemistry. We counted the numbers of NETs and analyzed its rate by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Five volunteers cooperated in this study. NETs were produced under both conditions. NETs amount decreased under hypoxia in the four out of five cases and the average reduction rate was 57.8 % (Fig. 11 ), although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). Conclusions: These results indicated that NETs production might decrease under low concentration of oxygen. Wound drainage may promote NETs production by providing fresh oxygen to the infected area. Further analysis has to be made to clarify the relations between NETs production and oxygen. Introduction: Administrative data is increasingly used in epidemiological research, but needs to be validated for this purpose. We therefore wanted to compare reported focus of infection in severe sepsis between administrative data and prospective cohort studies with chart review from Germany. Methods: We identified hospital cases with severe sepsis between 2007-2013 from the \"DRG-Statistik\", a database of nearly all German inpatient cases, by the specific ICD-10 code R65.1 (sepsis with organ dysfunction). Focus of infection was abstracted from documented diagnoses for each case. For comparison data on focus of infection was abstracted from a point prevalence study [1] and a prospective cohort study [2] of severe sepsis in German ICU's. Patients could have more than one focus in all three groups.",

Priorities in middle income countries should focus on improving 1) full barrier precautions and 2) using chlorhexidine >0.5 % for skin preparation. Reduction of device exposure through daily assessment of CL need remains a priority in both settings. Almost all respondents consider measurement of CLABSI key to quality improvement, however less than a quarter actually report their CLABSI rate. Our study was limited by a non-random sample of ICU doctors and nurses. Introduction: Urinary tract infections are common problems in patients in ICU with increased mortality, costs and hospitalization. The best way to treat urinary tract infections is to prevent them. The mechanism of action for preventing bacterial adhesion for noble metal alloy-coated urinary catheter is the generation of a galvanic effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of noble metal coated-catheter compared to silicone Foley catheter in patients admitted to our Toxicology-Intensive Care Unit for drug poisoning, with short-term catheterization. Methods: We enrolled 120 patients which were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: one group received noble metal alloycoated catheter (Group 1) and the other one received silicon Foley catheter (Group 2). We excluded all patients with urinary tract precontamination. Urine full examination and urine culture was taken at admission and on day 3 of catheterization. Results: The incidence of bacteriuria was 2 % with the noble metal alloy-coated catheter and 6.6 % with the silicone catheter (p < 0.05) after a mean period of 3 days' catheterization time. Age over 65 years (odds ratio 6.08) was significant risk factors for bacteriuria. The Gram negative bacteria of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most uropathogenic bacteria. We observed significant association between urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli and female gender (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Noble metal alloy-coated catheters may decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections compared with silicon ones and in the meantime may lower the need for antibiotics. Also, we noticed that the incidence of bacteriuria increased with age in both groups, but remained lower in noble metal alloy-coated catheter group. Methods : The retrospective data analysis of patients treated in surgical and medical intensive care units with positive blood culture for  Gram-negative rod during 2005-2012 years was carried out. Results: There were found 430 cases of Gram-negative rod monobacteremia, 77 (17.9 %) of them caused by Acinetobacter spp. There was no difference in gender, age, comorbidities, source of bacteremia, length of stay in intensive care unit for Acinetobacter spp. bacteremia (P > 0.05). Primary bacteremia was associated with surgical procedures (OR = 4.677, P = 0.03) and previously treatment in other hospital departments (OR = 1.02, P = 0.04). Acinetobacter spp. strain was associated with high resistance to antibiotics (P > 0.05), as: cefotaxim (n = 75, 97,4 %), ampicillin (n = 74, 96.1 %), cefuroxim and ceftazidim (n = 66, 85.7 %), gentamicin (n = 65, 84.4 %), piperacillin (n = 65, 84.4 %), piperacillin with tazobactam (n = 62, 80.5 %), ciprofloxacin (n = 59, 76.6 %), amikacin (n = 41, 53.2 %), ampicillin with sulbactam (n = 33, 42.9 %). The low resistance to carbapenems (n = 6, 7.8 %, P = 0.03) was estimated. Acinetobacter spp. strains were found to be mostly multi-drug-resistant, as resistant to > = 3 classes of antibiotics (n = 74, 96.1 %, P = 0.02), especially in postoperative patients (n = 37, 92.5 %, OR = 4.042, P = 0.04) and previously treated in other hospital departments (n = 41, 100 %, OR = 4.701, P = 0.03). Overall mortality rate of Acinetobacter spp. bacteremia was 84.4 %. Lethal outcome was associated with mechanical ventilation (n = 65, 100 %, OR = 4.105, P = 0.05), multi-drug-resistant strain (n = 64, 98,5 %, OR = 1.182, P = 0.013), elderly (n = 36, 90 %, OR = 1.662, P = 0.016), resistance to cefalosporins (n = 57, 86.4 %, OR = 2.367, P = 0.04), and alcohol abuse (n = 9, 81.8 %, OR = 3.926, P = 0.05). Conclusions: Acinetobacter spp. monobacteremia usually appears as caused by multi-drug-resistant > = 3 classes of antibiotics strain, but with low resistance to carbapenems, especially in postoperative patients and previously treated in other hospital departments. It has extremely high overall mortality rate. Mortality was associated with elderly, alcohol abuse, multi-drug-resistant strain and resistance to cefalosporins also mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Both Group A and Group B streptococcal infections were associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The APA-CHE 2 score appeared to predict the mortality reliably in patients with Group A Streptococcal infections. In patients with Group B Streptococcal infections however observed mortality was significantly higher than the predicted mortality from the APACHE 2 score. ICU and hospital length of stay were broadly comparable for those of the general ICU population over that period (means 216 and 648 hours respectively). Introduction: The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is usually investigated by cytobacteriologic analysis.we purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of the urinary strips URITOP + TM for rapid diagnosis of SBP and emphasize the utility of inoculation of blood culture bottles withascitic fluid for an accurate identification of bacteria. Methods: Our study included 44 patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites. Immediately, after paracentesis a urine test strips was performed searching visually the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on the ascitic fluid. The reaction between this fluid and the strip induced a color change. The color of the leukocyte reagent area was then compared with the color chart of the bottle and the result was scored in function of the number of crosses. Besides biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the ascitic fluid was done including bedside inoculation of five millimeters of this fluid into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Cultures of blood were also obtained from all patients. Results: SBP was diagnosed in 11 of the 44 samples. URITOP + TM test was positive in 8 cases. The reading of leukocytes strips revealed one cross, two crosses and three crosses in 15,4 %, 30,8 % and 15,4 % respectively. Nitrites were present in 69,5 % of cases. Blood and ascitic inoculation were positive in 46,2 % and 53,8 % respectively. The major bacteria isolated were gram-negative bacilli. We found a significant correlation between SBP and visual detection of white cells and nitrites (p < 10-3 for both parameters). A significant correlation was also found between SBP and both ascitic (p = 0,02) and blood (p = 0,006) inoculation. Both visual detection of leukocytes and asitic inoculation in blood culture bottles had a sensibility and a specificity of 100 %. Conclusions: Our study showed that URITOP + TM is a rapid and effective method in the early diagnosis of SBP. Besides the inoculation of blood culture bottles with ascitic fluid improves the detection of SBP and ameliorate consequently the prognosis. Introduction: Although it is well known that lymphedema of limbs is associated with higher possibility of developing cellulitis, the Introduction: Botulism is a rare paralytic illness caused by the action of a potent neurotropic exotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum species produce seven serologically distinct toxins, A-G. Human botulism is primarily caused by toxin types A, B or E. In Europe, most wound botulism is now associated with injectable drug use. Symptoms are of descending paralysis, bulbar palsies and respiratory failure. Methods: This is a review of the clinical, microbiological and public health aspects of an outbreak of botulism in Scotland from December 2014 to June 2015. Data was collected via prospective patient interview and clinical data collation. Results: 47 cases of wound botulism were reported: 23 probable, 17 confirmed, 5 discounted and two remain possible; Median age 42, range 24-55 years, 65 % were male. 98 % of cases presented with bulbar palsy but very few with descending limb weakness. 52 % of patients required surgical drainage of wound-related abscesses and 65 % required mechanical ventilation. All patients received 3-doses of trivalent anti-botulinum toxin therapy within 24 hours of clinical diagnosis. The diagnosis was microbiologically confirmed in 17 cases due to presence of C. botulinum type B neurotoxin detected by molecular assay in tissues and/or by serum bioassay. The C. botulinum strains from 10 cases showed a common profile on fAFLP typing, thereby confirming a link to a common source. All had a recent history of injecting heroin which was obtained either in, or sourced, via Glasgow. The source of infection remains unconfirmed but is thought to be due to contaminated heroin, or cutting agent. There were four deaths, botulism contributing to two. Police Scotland was closely involved in risk management through increased drug seizures throughout the region, reducing the supply of potentially 'contaminated' heroin. Public health measures included; risk communication via distributing postcards widely to PWIDs via drug agencies and needle exchange centres to increase awareness of signs and symptoms, advising smoking drugs as an alternative form of administration and the avoidance of muscle popping. Conclusions: This is the largest outbreak of botulism among PWIDs in Europe. Prompt identification of cases and appropriate clinical management resulted in low mortality amongst the cases. Interdisciplinary cooperation was integral in management of the outbreak. Introduction: Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) strains are considered to be important, since few antibiotics currently remain active against these bacteria. However, the implications associated with the surveillance of fecal carriers of ESBL-E among ICU patients are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of carrying out stool screening for ESBL-E.",

            "text": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the ICU of Fukuoka University Hospital from April 2013 to September 2014. The occurrence of infections or colonization with ESBL-E, the antimicrobial use density (AUD) values, and the clinical outcome were investigated for the described periods, and those parameters were compared between April-December 2013 (phase 1) and January-September 2014 (phase 2). Moreover, we routinely performed stool cultures for ESBL-E in phase 2. Results: Of the 1,245 patients who were admitted to our ICU during the study period, we identified 670 patients (phase 1) and 575 patients (phase 2) respectively. The rates of patients either infected or colonized with ESBL-E were significantly higher in phase 2 than phase 1 ( Introduction: ESBL and carbapenemase producing gram-negative pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge to the healthcare providers, both in hospital and in the community. Morbidity, mortality and the cost of health care delivery are all increased by the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, it becomes important to have a good knowledge of local microbial spectrum and sensitivity profile, so appropriate prophylactic antibiotics could be administered. This retrospective review was conducted to assess the prevalence of both ESBL and carbapenemase producers among the uropathogens in a newly opened tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the urine culture reports in our hospital over a one-year period, from Sep 2014 to Oct 2015. Data on the total requests and samples received, number of samples tested positive, organisms isolated and their sensitivity pattern were all collected. Results: During this period, the microbiology lab received a total of 1991 urine samples, 77 % (1533) from outpatients and 23 % (458) from inpatients. 18 % of the total samples received (358/1991) were culture positive (19 % in outpatients and 13 % in in-patients). 21 % of the outpatient and 63 % of the inpatient isolates were ESBL producers. E coli and Klebsiella were the commonest organisms isolated (290/358; 81 %). 92 % of the in-hospital and 73 % of the outpatient ESBL isolate was E. coli. 5 % of the in-hospital isolates were carbapenemase producers. Conclusions: The incidence of ESBL and carbapenemase production among in-hospital uropathogens is very high at 63 % and 5 % respectively. This confirms the global increase in the incidence of ESBLs and carbapenemases. Although carbapenemase production in the community is only 0.6 %, sepsis caused by these isolates is very difficult to treat with high mortality rates. Appropriate antibiotic use, following a deescalation strategy and good antimicrobial stewardship are very important in improving outcomes and preventing the spread of further resistance. Instead of following the general antibiotic guidelines, developing robust local guidelines based on the microbiological data on antibiotic sensitivity of the organisms to guide prophylaxis will be helpful in achieving high rates of clinical cure. Reference Introduction: Here, we determined whether the Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) class 2 integron is in the soil around our hospital, and if the soil is the cause for increasing numbers of A. baumannii infections in our intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A. baumannii has emerged globally as a significant pathogen in hospitals. It is also present in soil and water. In a previous study, we discovered that the A. baumannii class 2 integron occurred most frequently.",

Patient, soil, and hospital environment samples were collected. All isolates were identified using standard bacteriologic and biochemical methods. The phenotypes and genotypes were characterized. The standard disc diffusion method was utilized to test antimicrobial susceptibility. Integron identification was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: There were no A. baumannii bacteria isolated from the hospital environment or soil, although the bacterium was detected around the lip of one patient. Also, a total of 42 A. baumannii clinical strains were isolated from the lower respiratory tract (n = 20), blood (n = 6), urine (n = 8), and wound catheters and nasal swabs (n = 8). 65 % of the isolated species were classified as class 2 integrons. The strains were 100 % resistant to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, cefepime, ceropenem, and cefotaxime.

Introduction: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Bacteria are a worldwide threat especially for intensive care unit's patients (ICU). In Gram Negative Bacilli, the emergence and spread of Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) is one of the common causes of morbidity and mortality associated with ICU-acquired infections (ICU AI). The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology and risk factors for ESBL and CPB infections as well as the resistance patterns of these bacteria isolated in a Tunisian multidisciplinary intensive care unit. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, case-control study including all patients admitted between January and October 2015. ICU AI were defined as those acquired no less than 48 h after ICU admission. We did not include patients with no bacteriological evidence of infection. Differences in ICU mortality, length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were tested across patients with and without ICU acquired MDR bacteria infections. We also assessed infected sites, most frequent bacteria for each group (ESBL and CPB), and looked for risk factors. Results: In the study period, 184 patients were admitted to the ICU, 67 (34,41 %) had ICU AI. From these 67 patients, 35 had an ESBL infection in 53 isolates, and 21 patients were infected with CPB isolated from 30 cultures. Global mortality in the study period was 44,59 %, the mortality associated to MDR infection was 51,16 %. In fact, mortality of ESBL infections was not so higher than the global one (48,57 %) whereas CPB infection weighed down mortality to reach 71,43 %. In the same way, length of stay was significantly longer in MDR infected patients (18,37 days \u00b1 11.6 STD) than non-MDR infected ones (8,66 \u00b1 4.60 STD, p < 0,001). MV duration was respectively 15,85 days (\u00b112,51 STD) in MDR group and 6,62 days (\u00b15,10 STD, p < 0,001) in the non-MDR infected group. Length of stay and duration of MV were found to be risk factors for acquiring MDR infection in ICU. Ventilator associated pneumonia was the most frequent acquired infection as well in non MDR infected patients as in both ESBL and CPB. Acinetobacter Baumannii was the leading isolate from CPB infection (60 %) followed by Klebsiella Pneumoniae (27 %). Concerning bacilli producing ESBL, Klebsiella Pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated (54,72 %) followed by Escherichia Coli and Enterobacter Cloacae (15,09 % each). Conclusions: The prevalence of ESBL and CPB is increasing day by day in nearly every center of different countries and is responsible for large number of hospital-acquired and nosocomial infections, with very few, if any, therapeutic options. Necessary steps to prevent the spread and emergence of resistance should be taken. The mortality rate was 13 % (n = 4). We found a statistical significant association between the SAPS II score and mortality: higher scores are linked to death (Mann Whitney U test). We also found association between higher leukocyte count and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at admission with death (Mann Whitney U test). We did not find association between any other analytical abnormality at admission and at death. We also did not find any bad outcome association with patients' symptoms, physical examination abnormalities, renal or ventilation support (Person's Qui Squared Test).",

Introduction: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused several hospital outbreaks and frequently leads to severe critical illness. To learn from our experience, we described the response of our intensive care unit (ICU) to a MERS-CoV hospital outbreak. Methods: This observational study was conducted at a 1000-bed tertiary-care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia which had a MERS-CoV outbreak in Aug-Sep 2015. Our Intensive Care Department covered 5 ICUs with 60 single-bedded rooms. We described qualitatively and, as applicable, quantitatively, the response of intensive care services to the outbreak. The clinical course and outcomes of hospital workers who had MERS were noted. Results: A total of 62 critically ill MERS patients were cohorted in 3 ICUs during the outbreak with a peak census of 27 MERS patients on Aug 25, 2015 and the last new case on Sep 13, 2015. Most patients had multiorgan failure requiring support. Eight hospital employees had MERS requiring ICU admission for a median stay of 28 days: 7 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4 were treated with proning, 4 needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 53 % (0 % for the hospital employees). All MERS patients were admitted in single negative pressure rooms, which were promptly increased from 14 to 38 rooms. The nurse-topatient ratio was~1.2:1. Infection prevention practices were intensified. For example, the consumption of surface disinfectants and hand hygiene gel increased by~30 % and an average of 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day. Family visits were restricted to 2 hours/ day and the ICU physicians communicated with the next of kin by phone daily. During the outbreak, 2 ICU nurses and 1 physician tested positive for MERS-CoV, had mild disease and recovered fully. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, none refused to report to work. However, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS ICUs had upper respiratory symptoms, but tested negative for MERS-CoV. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians. Conclusions: Our hospital outbreak of MERS-CoV resulted in many patients requiring organ support and prolonged ICU stay. Their mortality rate was high but lower than previously reported. The response to the outbreak required facility and staff management and proper implementation of infection control and prevention practices. (1). We included all cases containing data about age and gender (at minimum) and excluded cases reported as clusters. Data on age, gender, comorbidities, healthcare worker, contact with camels, contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case, date of symptom onset and date of laboratory confirmation were retrieved and analyzed. Results: A total of 219 outbreak news reports were released by the WHO, 977 cases were include in our study; 68.8 % males: mean (SD) age was 53.2 years (17.9), and 31.2 % females: mean (SD) age was 53.2 years (18.4), where the youngest patient reported was 10 month and the oldest patient reported was 109 year old. Comorbidities were reported in 46.9 %: mean (SD) age was 60.1 (15.4) and 71.8 % male and 28.2 % female. Healthcare workers were reported to be 15.6 %, mean (SD) age was 38.6 (11.3) and 53.3 % male, 46.7 % female and 19.7 % of them had comorbidities. 12.1 % reported with history of camel contact; mean (SD) age was 56.7 (15.1) and 91.7 % male, 8.3 % female and 77.1 % of them had comorbidities. 25.3 % were reported to have contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS case: mean (SD) age was 43.9 (17.0), 63.0 % male 37.0 % female, 36.0 % reported to have comorbidities and 30.5 % were healthcare workers. Date of symptoms onset and date of laboratory confirmation were reported in 86.2 % and 56.5 % respectively. The overall mean (SD) of time from symptoms onset to date of laboratory confirmation was 5.2 days (4.2) (95 % CI, 4.8-5.5).

Two cases were community -acquired with the third being hospitalacquired. The organisms identified by the TAC were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Aspergillus spp. Cryptosporidium parvum and Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCJ), with one patient having two organisms detected. M. pneumoniae and PCJ were not identified on standard cultures, whilst Crytposporidum and Aspergillus spp and were both identified on conventional culture/microscopy 5 days after TAC identification. In all three cases, the results of the TAC assay resulted in change in management, with institution of new antimicrobials targeting the organisms identified combined with rationalisation of pre-existing antimicrobial treatments. Discussion These three cases illustrate how conventional cultures may miss important or unexpected pathogens, or return results late on in the course of the disease. We believe that this technology has the potential to significantly impact on the management of critically ill patients with lung infections, and are currently planning a larger scale evaluation of its use in critical care. Introduction: Pneumonia is a major cause for ICU admission and mortality. Prompt investigation facilitates tailored antimicrobial strategy, guides management, and aids prognostication. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) [1] suggest specific tests are performed for patients with severe pneumonia: Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigens, sputum and blood cultures, respiratory viral PCR swabs, and atypical serology testing. We suspected these tests were inconsistently undertaken or delayed in our ICU, and introduced a computerised pneumonia screen, 'BUNS' , (Blood cultures and viral serology/Urinary antigens/Nasal +/-endotracheal viral swab/Sputum sample) to consistently investigate this condition. Methods: All patients with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia admitted to a UK district hospital ICU over a one-year period up to 31/ 10/14 were retrospectively reviewed to determine which investigations had been requested within 24 hours of admission. These were compared to the BTS guideline [1] . We subsequently implemented the 'BUNS pneumonia screen' within our electronic investigation system. A single click auto-generated request labels for all tests in the BTS guidelines. After implementation and staff education, we repeated the data collection between 1/2/15 and 1/11/15. Results: See Table 10 . Conclusions: This study has shown that a computerised autogenerated set of investigation requests, aided by an easily remembered acronym, lead to increased proportion of patients (85 % vs 28 %) receiving prompt and consistent 'gold standard' investigations for pneumonia. We believe this reduced duplication and delay in obtaining diagnostic results, thereby improving patient care. We suggest the 'Bundle of BUNS' could be easily replicated in other ICUs, and a similar system could be introduced for other presenting conditions. Introduction: Despite the significant impact of nosocomial infections on the morbidity and mortality of patients staying in the intensive care unit (ICU), no study over the past 20 years has focused specifically on pneumonia following secondary peritonitis. Our objective is to determine epidemiological features and in-hospital mortality of pneumonia in this kind of patients. Methods: Prospective observational study involved 418 consecutive patients admitted in the ICU, who had undergone a laparotomy because of a secondary peritonitis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and development of pneumonia. Results: The incidence of pneumonia following secondary peritonitis was 9.6 %. Risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia were hospital-acquired peritonitis, >48 h of mechanical ventilation, and SOFA score. The onset of pneumonia was late in majority of patients (about 16.8 days after the initiation of the peritonitis), and the etiological microorganisms responsible for it were different than for peritonitis. The 90-day in-hospital mortality rate was 47.5 % of pneumonia patients. Independent factors associated with 30-90-day in-hospital mortality were pneumonia and SOFA score Conclusions: Pneumonia in patients who had undergone a surgery because of a secondary peritonitis, increases the 90-day mortality. The onset of pneumonia following secondary peritonitis usually is late (16.8 days) and with etiological microorganisms different than those responsable for secondary peritonitis Introduction: The \"CURB-65 score\" is a convenient, well validated tool to assess disease severity and aid in the clinical management of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1] . Recent literature however demonstrates that its use is variable and often inaccurate. Failure to use this tool may lead to over or under treatment and may result in inappropriate patient admission thereby increasing healthcare costs [2] . The aim of the initial audit was to determine the frequency of the use of the score in emergency medical care and correlate this with clinical decision-making. The data was analysed and common pitfalls were identified. After the implementation of various tools designed to address these issues a repeat audit was performed to assess for any improvements.",

Alongside this a pre-designed set of electronic antibiotic prescription sets were created and incorporated into the electronic prescribing system in use at the audit site. These accountated for allergies, patient weight and renal/ hepatic function. A further 50 case notes of patients presenting with a CAP were then retrospectively reviewed during December 2014-Jan 2015 in order to assess the impact of the above interventions.",

            "text": "Results: There was a significant increase in the number of case records containing a documented CURB-65 score after the implementation of the above interventions (43.4 % VS 92.0 %). There was an associated improvement in the accuracy of calculated scores (77.8 % VS 92.0 %). In turn, more patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy (86.7 % VS 100 %). Of note, 6 patients prior to the interventions were admitted despite their calculated CURB-65 score being 0-1 without an alternate reason being documented. After the implementation of these interventions no patients were admitted with these scores. Conclusions: Staff education, tools to aid accurate CURB 65 calculation and pre-created antibiotic order sets lead to improvements in the initial assessment and subsequent management of patients presenting with CAP. These changes should be consider for use on a wider scale. Introduction: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines acknowledge respiratory viruses as a cause for CAP, but provide few recommendations regarding diagnosis or treatment due to lack of data [1] . New technology to detect viral pathogens by highly sensitive nucleic amplification tests has allowed for identification of additional viruses through a small sample of respiratory secretions [2] . Our aim is to describe the incidence of viruses in mechanically ventilated patients with CAP in the ICU. Results: 266 patients were ventilated for more than two days. The HVAP and PVAP rates per 1000 at risk ventilation days (total diagnoses) were 5.0 (10) and 2.0 (4) respectively. Concordance between diagnoses was poor (Cohen's Kappa -0.02 (95 % CI: -0.04 to -0.01)). HVAP was statistically associated with longer stay and ventilation, in contrast to PVAP [1] and monitoring [2] . Dynamic linear/arborescent air-bronchogram is specific for VAP. Methods: 2 patients suspected for VAP were examined before and after fiberbronchoscopy (FBS) by LUS, focusing on subpleural consolidations, lobar/hemilobar consolidations and air-bronchogram. Bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) was performed. Results: Before FBS, LUS pattern wasn't specific for VAP: both patients had only bilateral consolidations with no air-bronchogram (Fig. 16a,c) . After FBS, LUS pattern changed. In patient 1, the tissuelike pattern turned into B-lines (Fig. 16b) . BAL was negative. In patient 2, the same tissue-like pattern was visualized after FBS; a dynamic arborescent air-bronchogram appeared (Fig. 16d ). BAL had P.Aeruginosa 10(6) CFU/ml. Conclusions: LUS allows early bedside VAP diagnosis. If the pattern is non specific, changes after FBS may be useful: reaeration orients to atelectasis; persistence of complete loss of aeration with dynamic airbronchogram appearance orients to VAP. Methods: This retrospective study recruited patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Anesthesiology Department, Marmara University Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey), from January 2014 to September 2015. Patients' progress was followed until the 28th day after the diagnosis of VAP, when they were considered survivors. Patients who died before the 28th day were non-survivors. Patients discharged from the ICU before the 28th day were also considered survivors. APACHE II score was assessed during first 24 h of admission; CPIS and CEPPIS score were assessed at the onset of VAP (day 1). SOFA score, serum CRP, serum PCT, pro-BNP were assessed on day 1,4, 7 of VAP diagnosis and were correlated with 28-day survival and mortality. Results: A total of 44 patients were enrolled. Of them, 23 (52.2 %) died before day 28 after VAP diagnosis. The SOFA score in our study was significantly lower in survivors at day 1, 4 and 7 compared with nonsurvivors. In terms of APACHE II score, CPIS and cause of admission; the two groups were comparable. There were no significant difference between the nonsurvivors and survivors in terms of PCT, CRP, leucocyte count at days 1 and 7. However, the leucocyte count, PCT and CRP levels on day 4 were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than survivors. Also pro-BNP levels at days 4 and 7 were significantly higher in the nonsurvivors than survivors. Conclusions: The biomarkers, PCT, CRP and pro-BNP, can predict mortality in VAP, as can SOFA score. Although, CPIS and CEPPIS has been described as useful scoring systems for diagnosis for VAP, they did no differentiate between survivors and nonsurvivors. In compare to CPIS, CEPPIS, a score based on chest ultrasonography and procalcitonin levels, may be a better predictor of diagnosis of VAP. Introductions: The aim of our observation retrospective study was to test the hypothesis that a correlation exists between pRBCs transfusion and the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP (% VP) in our both medical and surgical ICU served in community hospital. Methods: From January 2006 to June 2014 admitted to our ICU 620 patients. We looked for the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP and the following indexes according pRBCs transfusion per year from 2006 to 2014. Total, per patient, per hospitalization days (HD), per patient ventilated (pts V), per ventilation days (VD) Using linear correlation method, we looked for linear slope, correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (r2), and by linear regression method using ANOVA test we looked for p value, according % VP and pRBCs transfusion. Results: Conclusions: According to our data, there was no statistically significant correlation detected between the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP and pRBC transfusion. Our data suggest that even though pRBC transfusion may have an impact on immunosuppression and infection disease developing, the impact on the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP is not statistically significant. Introductions: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has a reported incidence of between 9 -27 % and a strong association with increased ICU length of stay and mortality [1] . Current evidence suggests that the application of a care 'bundle' may reduce the rate of VAP [2] . We aimed to assess the effects of a sequential multifaceted care bundle and audit program on VAP rates in our institution. Methods: The existing care bundle (head up positioning, daily sedation holds) was supplemented by a 3-step process of interventions between December 2008 and October 2015, each accompanied by a dedicated staff education initiative: 1) Guidance on stress ulcer prophylaxis, changing of respiratory circuitry and sedation holds; 2) Introduction of a new endotracheal tube with continuous subglottic suction and cuff pressure monitoring; 3) New oral hygiene guidance. Data was analysed using MS excel and a statistical process control chart designed for non-conformity attribute data with an unequal area of opportunity. Values are expressed as mean and upper control limits (UCLu). Results: A total number of 26480 consecutive ventilator days were assessed. Monthly VAP rates remained stable around a constant mean of 16.45 per 1000 ventilator days between December 2008 and September 2013. Following introduction of oral hygiene guidance, a statistically significant shift in process occurred identifying a special cause. This represents a reduction of monthly VAP rate to 7.44 per 1000 ventilator days (Fig. 17) . Conclusions: Introduction of a multidisciplinary stepwise VAP prevention initiative led to a significant reduction in mean monthly VAP rates over time.",

Chastre 1 , B. Introductions: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. The organism produces an array of factors that contribute to its virulence. Two such virulence factors are the Psl exopolysaccharide, which contributes to bacterial persistence, and the PcrV protein which contributes to the virulence of the organism. MEDI3902 is a novel bivalent, bispecific mAb that selectively binds to both factors, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity and immune evasion properties of the pathogen. Psl and PcrV target expression is independent of antibiotic susceptibility status; therefore, MEDI3902 also has the potential to be active against multi-drug resistant strains of P aeruginosa. MEDI3902 is being developed for the prevention of P aeruginosa pneumonia. We describe the rationale and design of the EVADE study to investigate the use of MEDI3902 in mechanically-ventilated (MV) subjects. Introductions: Colistin, a last-line therapeutic agent for the treatment of multidrug-resistance gram-negative infections, is limited in its use due to nephrotoxicity. This retrospective cohort study evaluates risk factors for colistin-induced severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Methods: Patients admitted to a university hospital ICU, were without pre-existing kidney injury, and received colistin therapy 72 or more hours were included. Patient demographics, the source of infection and outcome were collected. AKI was evaluated by using the Introductions: Despite the administration of body-weight standardized starting doses of gentamicin, a wide range in peak concentration (Cpeak) is generally observed in critically ill patients resulting from variable pharmacokinetics of gentamicin between patients and within a patient over time. This may hamper the efficacy of gentamicin treatment. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the percentage of patients that reached a target Cpeak level of 15-20 mg/L after the first dose as well as after subsequent doses during which therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was applied and 2) to quantify the impact of several patient parameters on the volume of distribution (Vd) of gentamicin, which is correlated with Cpeak.",

Since gross fluctuations in Cpeak were observed over time within patients, Cpeak should be measured repeatedly when patients receive gentamicin treatment for more than 2 days. Introductions: Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic with the potential for significant, but under-appreciated neurotoxicity due to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and antagonize GABA activity in a concentration dependent fashion. Data suggest that 15 % of ICU patients treated with cefepime will experience neurotoxicity with symptoms that range from encephalopathy, myoclonus, seizures and coma.

To treat the inflammatory reaction an antibiotic therapy is fundamental [1] . Effects of disease pattern and intensive care measures (e.g. sepsis) on heart rate and variability are poorly understood.

Results: Results obtained from 14 treatments with Unasyn\u00ae demonstrate that from the onset of the infusion the QT-interval increases additionally up to 39 ms (p < 0,05). This variation persisted for the first three minutes of therapy and returns during the next two minutes to their pre-values. Other ECG data remained unchanged during the time of treatment. Conclusions: Haemodynamic alterations -QT-interval prolongationcould be detected with onset of antibiotic treatment with Unasyn\u00ae. The similar antibiotic Tazonam\u00ae showed in another study of us no significant beat-to-beat changes. With regard to comorbidities of ICU patients, it seems reasonable that changes in cardiac electric activity might be observed even earlier during their ICU stay. Introductions: Bacteriophages are environmental viruses. Lytic phages have proprieties to penetrate and multiply inside their targeted bacteria until the release of new virions. Many clinical empirical data are available from Georgia and Poland, but no control randomized clinical trial is available. The phagoburn study assess efficacy and tolerance of two cocktails of bacteriophages against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: Natural phages were isolated from hospital and Paris sewages. They were featured by phenotype and genotype to exclude transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and lysogenic proprieties by Pherecydes-Pharma. PP0121 is a cocktail of 12 phages against E coli, and PP1131 was performed against P. aeruginosa. Cocktails are applied by a topical way in burn patients infected by E. coli or P. aeruginosa applied through an alginate gauze (Algosteril) onto infected wounds. The control arm is treated by Silver Sulfadiazine (standard treatment). The main goal is the comparison of time to reduce bacterial load of 2 quadrants on plate by daily eSwabs. 220 patients are expected. All patients are hospitalized in a burn unit to ensure a safety environment. Results: Phagoburn was funded by European Commission (FP7) in 2013 for 3,8 million Euros. After transfer from research and development to a Master Phage Bank, bioproduction of phages was performed in GMPlike conditions by Clean Cells (Nantes-France). As a systemic absorption of phages is supposed, an isolator was necessary to ensure a sterile and apyrogenic solution. The 3 european regulators (French agency ANSM, AFMPS for Belgium, and Swiss-Medic for Switzerland) allowed the first inclusion in July 2015. In December, 15 patients were already included in 11 investigators centers. Conclusions: One century after phages discovery, Phagoburn is the first mutlicentric control randomized trial ever done in the world about phage therapy in humans. Results will be available in 2016. Phages could be an old but innovative way in the war against antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance could be the leading cause of mortality in 2050. Introductions: The management of invasive candidiasis (IC) remains a major challenge. Delayed antifungal therapy is known as an independent mortality factor in Septic shock attributed to IC [1] . Thus, empiric antifungal therapy (EAFT) can be indicated in septic patients at risk of IC. However, the unreasonable administration of antifungal is implicated in emergence of resistant candida strains [2] . The purpose was to evaluate the impact of an EAFT on 28-day survival in septic patients without documented Candida infection.",

Introductions: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. We hypothesized that MPs from stored RBC bags can induce endothelial activation, either directly or mediated by immune cells. Methods: MPs were isolated by high speed centrifugation from RBC transfusion bags. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECS) were incubated for 6 hours with supernatant from RBC bags either containing MPs or depleted from MPs, with or without addition of monocytes or granulocytes. Controls were incubated with PBS as a negative and TNF as a positive control. Expression of adhesion markers were measured on flow cytometry and markers of coagulation and inflammation were measured in the culture medium. Monocytes were cultured with stained MPs and adherence was studied using confocal microscopy. Results: Supernatant from RBCs containing MPs up-regulate endothelial expression of ICAM and E-selectin with 7.8 [2.8 -22.9]% and 2.6 [-1 -7.7]% resp. compared to baseline. Up-regulation was absent when stimulated with RBC supernatant depleted from MPs. Also, upregulation depended on the presence of monocytes. MPs adhere to monocytes, which was partly abrogated after co-incubation with antiCD11b or anti-CD18 antibodies (from 100 to 67[57-72]% and to 56[47-67]% of positive cells resp.). RBC-derived EVs also strongly induce endothelial shedding of vWF. Conclusions: Up-regulation of endothelial cell adhesion markers and shedding of vWF antigen following RBC transfusion is caused by MP, and requires the presence of monocytes. Thereby, MPs from RBC units induce a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant endothelial cell response. Introductions: The development of thrombosis in ICU patients is one of the most frequent causes for unfavourable outcome. The different types severe illness are accompanied by activation of cellular and biochemical processes. The aim of the study is to investigate the possible effect of cytokines on thrombosis in trauma and neurosurgical patients in ICU. Methods: Eighty-four patients, 46 with trauma and 38neurosurgical included in the study, divided into two groups according to thrombosis incidence. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and a single blood sample collected on admission. Interleukins (IL-) -6,-8,-10 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, were determined in serum by ELISA. Statistics performed with Graphpad 5.0. Results: Patients with thrombosis showed statistically significant elevated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, p < 0.01, IL-6, p < 0.05) and lower anti-inflammatory IL-10 release (p < 0.05) on admission, compared to those without thrombosis. IL-8 admission levels, had no difference between groups (p > 0.05), due to later expression. There were no significant differences between age and hospitalization days in both groups. Thrombosis found to be correlated with poor outcome (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The early activation of cytokines in trauma and neurosurgical patients seems to play an important role on thrombosis development and further patient's outcome. Introductions: The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute burn patients has been reported to range from 0.4 %-23%.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Preoperative assessment of TG measured by CAT was predictive for blood loss following cardiac surgery. These findings may help in identifying patients at risk for postoperative bleeding complications. Introductions: Bleedings in severe thrombocytopenia (TCP) vary from mild to severe and may be even life-threatening when accompanied with hemodilution as a result of trauma and subsequent fluid resuscitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fibrinogen and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA) on clot quality and resistance to fibrinolysis in a model of TCP and hemodilution. Methods: Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers who signed an informed consent form approved by the local research ethics committee. TCP [(16 \u00b1 4) x 10 6 mL -1 ] was created by mixing plateletpoor plasma with packed cells. The samples were diluted or not to 60 % with TRIS/saline buffer and subjected to clotting in the presence of tPA. Blood was spiked with fibrinogen (3.0 mg/mL) and/or FEIBA (1 U/mL). Maximum clot firmness (MCF, mm) and lysis onset time (LOT, min) were evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry and presented as Mean \u00b1 SD. Results: MCF in nondiluted TCP blood was 18 \u00b1 5. Spiking the blood with fibrinogen and FEIBA increased it to 29 \u00b1 4 and 27 \u00b1 7, respectively (P < 0.001). Combined use of these agents increased MCF to 34 \u00b1 4 (P < 0.01). Dilution of TCP blood reduced MCF to 9 \u00b1 5 (P < 0.001). Spiking diluted blood with fibrinogen increased MCF to 15 \u00b1 4 (P < 0.01), spiking with FEIBA increased it to 22 \u00b1 4 (P < 0.01), and combination of both agents had the greatest effect on MCF that reached 30 \u00b1 6 (P < 0.01) and did not differ from its level in nondiluted blood following combined spiking. LOT in nondiluted TCP blood was 13.1 \u00b1 5.1. Spiking the blood with fibrinogen had no effect on LOT while spiking with FEIBA prolonged it to 21.5 \u00b1 7.3 (P < 0.05). Combined use of both agents further increased LOT to 33.0 \u00b1 4.6 (P < 0.01). Dilution of blood as well as spiking diluted blood with fibrinogen had no significant effect on LOT while spiking with FEIBA prolonged it to the same extent as in non-diluted blood (P < 0.05). Compared to FEIBA, combination of both agents slightly prolonged LOT, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Both in nondiluted and diluted TCP blood: (1) fibrinogen and FEIBA synergistically improve clot quality (firmness); (2) fibrinogen alone does not increase clot resistance to fibrinolysis but potentiates such effect of FEIBA if added in combination. Both agents could serve as alternative therapeutic approach to bleeding patients with severe TCP. Introductions: Activated clotting time (ACT) is currently used for dose adjustment of heparin during CPB, and has been thought as gold standard in this field. However, in difficult case, such as prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, consumption coagulopathy might also occur, and there might be need for blood components. Monitoring ACT only is not adequate in such case. The CoaguChek XS system is a portable instrument for monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy. It determines the PTINR value from a drop of capillary blood specimen, and it has been reported that accuracy seems to be better for hematocrit (Ht) >30 %. We compared PTINR measured by CoaguChek XS (CCINR) with PTINR analyzed by laboratory test (LabINR) after CPB. Methods: 34 patients who underwent CPB were enrolled. After weaning from CPB and heparin reversal by protamine administration, CCINR, LabINR, ACT, aPTT and Ht were measured. The correlations between CCINR and LabINR, ACT and aPTT, were assessed. Results: CCINR correlated well with labINR (r = 0.81, Y = -0.163 + 1.191 X). Moreover, evaluating subgroup whose Ht <30 % (N = 27, mean Ht 24.6 %), correlation was thought to be acceptable (r = 0.706, Y =0.047 + 1.058 X). On the other hand, correlation between ACT and aPTT, widely considered as \"the Gold standard h was inferior (r = 0.567, Y =0.047 + 1.058 X). Conclusions: CCINR is an useful alternative to labINR for guiding blood component therapy after CPB. Introductions: The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system has been developed as a simple tool to diagnose DIC. It is based on platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen level and fibrin degradation products (FDP) or D-Dimer results. However, the score is less useful in critical illness as D-Dimers and FDP are usually elevated due to the underlying disease. Hence neither DIC scoring nor FDP or D-Dimer measurements are routinely performed in ICU. Triggers to request D-Dimer measurements have not been established. Methods: This retrospective study included ICU patients admitted to the RLUH over a 4-year period. Demographic details were collected at admission along with routine blood results for the first 7 days. A truncated DIC score was calculated for all patients who had coagulation tests done for 7 days: Platelet count >100x10 9 /L = 0 points, >50 to <100x10 9 /L = 1 point, < 50x10 9 /L = 2 points, PT <3 s prolonged = 0 points, >3 s but <6 s = 1 point, >6 s = 2 points, fibrinogen >1.5 g/L = 0 points, <1.5 g/L = 1 point. Patients with a truncated DIC score of \u22652 were considered high risk for DIC. In this patient cohort, highly elevated D-Dimers would establish a diagnosis of overt DIC. Patients admitted after elective surgery and those who stayed on ICU <7 days were excluded. Results: 464 patients were included in the analysis. ICU mortality was 25.4 %. Mean APACHE II was 19.8 \u00b1 7.1. 272 patients had a maximum DIC score of 0 (167 patients) or 1 (105 patients) and were not at risk for overt DIC. However, 192 patients had a maximum DIC score of \u22652, with 14 patients displaying a DIC score of 5 even without D-Dimer results available. In none of the patients with a DIC score of \u22652, D-Dimer or FDPs were analysed. Only one patient with a DIC score of \u22652 had normal platelet counts and two patients showed mild thrombocytopenia. All patients with severe thrombocytopenia and 73 of 122 patients with moderate thrombocytopenia had a DIC score of \u22652. Conclusions: DIC, although associated with outcome, remains underdiagnosed in critically ill patients. In patients with moderate or severe thrombocytopenia a truncated DIC score should be calculated. If the score is between 2 and 4, measurement of D-Dimers or FDP should be requested to fully establish the diagnosis of DIC. Introductions: Diagnosing thromboembolic disease represents a challenge in older patients with COPD. The ADJUST-PE study has recently validated a new age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (age x 10) in patients older than 50 years old. When the results of this study are cautiously analyzed, it seems that the validity of this cutoff in patients with COPD is unreliable. The objective of the current study was to specifically validate or invalidate the use of the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in patients with COPD aged 50 or older. Methods: Files from patients who visited the emergency department of H\u00f4pital Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montr\u00e9al between March 2008 and May 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients aged 50 and older with COPD and with a non-high pretest probability of thromboembolic disease were included. These patients all had a D-dimer measurement and a radiologic exam (pulmonary angioscan, ventilation/perfusion lung scan or a lower extremity doppler). The results are presented in proportions with 95 % confidence intervals without continuity correction and with sensitivity measurements. Results: 195 patients were included according to those criteria. 5 were excluded from analysis because of a non-confirmed diagnosis. Among the 190 patients analyzed, 15 had a diagnosis of thromboembolic disease, resulting in a prevalence of 7,89 % (IC95% = 4,49 %-12,69 %). 4 had a negative D-dimer level with the conventional cutoff (<500 \u03bcg/L) and 15 (all of them) had a negative d-dimer level with the age-adjusted cutoff. The sensitivity of the conventional cutoff was 73,33 % (IC95% = 44,90 %-92,21 %) and the sensitivity of the age-adjusted cutoff was 0 % (IC95% = 0,00 %-21,80 %). Conclusions: In conclusion, the new age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff cannot be used safely in patient with COPD older than 50 years old who have a non-high pretest probability of thromboembolic disease. Introductions: Aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of low hemoglobulin (<7 g/dl) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because of hemodilution, on postoperative mortality and morbidity. Methods: A total of 667 patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery procedures under the use of CPB in our department during a 2 years period were retrospectively studied. The lowest value of hemoglobulin (Nadir Hb) throughout CPB was recorded. Group A consisted of patients with Hb < 7 g/dl, while group B was the control group. The following perioperative outcome indices were compared between 2 groups: Increase of Lactate (Lac) value at the end of CPB, acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by RIFLE criteria, postoperative use of non invasive ventilation (NIV), prolonged mechanical ventilation (>48 hours), perioperative infarction (PMI), stroke, total red blood transfusion > 3units, atrial fibrillation(AF) and mortality. Statistical analysis was based on chi-square test. Results: 162 patients consist group A and 505 control group. Results are shown on Table 17 . Conclusions: Optimal hemoglobulin during CPB has not been defined. Severe hemodilutional anemia (Hb < 7 g/dl) has statistical significant correlation with increase of Lac value at the end of CPB, postoperative AKI, use of NIV, prolonged mechanical ventilation, transfusion with >3 red blood cell units and has strong correlation with mortality. Introduction: Some studies have found a correlation between increased RDW and mortality in ICU patients. However, RDW values can be increased by transfusion (RBCT), erythropoiesis or hemolysis. In this study we investigated whether the prognostic value of RDW was influenced by RBCT in ICU patients. Methods: All patients admitted to ICU over 8 months were enrolled in the study. Patients were analyzed in two groups (A if no RBCT was given and B receiving RBCT before ICU admission). We measured RDW, reticulocyte index (RI) and haptoglobin on admission and 48 h thereafter. RDW was categorized in tertiles: <14 %; 14,1-15,8 %; >15,8 %. We collected 28-day mortality, changes in SOFA score and length of stay in ICU Results: 102 patients were enrolled(64 in group A and 38 in group B).Clinical variables are shown in Fig. 25 . Cox-regression analysis shows that high RDW values were significantly associated with 28-day mortality (Fig. 26) . Patients in Group B had higher level of RDW on admission (16.7 \u00b1 2 % vs. 15.1 \u00b1 2.2 %; p = 0.03). Nevertheless, the accuracy of RDW to predict mortality was similar in the two groups (ROC curve 0.697 for group A and 0.711 for group B). Patients with higher RDW had also a lower RI but similar levels of haptoglobin when compared to others. Conclusions: Among critically ill patients RBCT were associated with higher RDW but this did not influence the prognostic value of RDW.",

These critically ill children presented in many occasions with anemia and thrombocytopenia, hemodynamic instability, clotting and bleeding disorders (while they were in infection) and the administration of blood and blood product derivatives were paramount to them. The immediate recognition of transfusion indications, and the early prompt interventions lead to better and faster recovery of small patients.",

Introductions: Irrespective of aetiology, major haemorrhage is associated with poor patient outcome and its management presents considerable clinical and logistic challenges. The introduction of inhospital major haemorrhage protocols, following damage control resuscitation (DCR) principles, has demonstrated improved patient outcome and blood product delivery with reduced wastage of blood products. 1,2 However, simple adaptation of hospital-derived protocols is inadequate for use by retrieval teams and a tailored approach is required to address the specific challenges encountered.

Intensivist's task is to maintain organic homeostasis to allow PMD to reach withdrawal multiorgan in the best conditions, protecting from possible damage post neurovegetative storm (NS). NS causes severe hemodynamic instability resulting in peripheral hypoperfusion, hypotension, high values of lactates (LA), polyuria, depletion of catecholamine and stunning heart. Aim of our prospective study was to evaluate efficacy of terlipressin vs. norepinephrine in maintaining hemodynamic stability after NS [1] . Methods: 10 adult patients hospitalized in intensive care with acute brain injury, diagnosis of brain death, post NS, mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. The patients were divided into two groups: 5 patients, group norepinephrine (infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min for 6 hours) and 5 patients, group terlipressin (infusion at 1.5 mcg/kg/h for 6 hours). These parameters were collected for each patients: mean arterial pressure (MAP), values of LA. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For the comparison between the groups was used the Fisher test, considering significant for a p < =0.05. Results: After 6 hours of treatment group norepinephrine: MAP 85 \u00b1 4mmgh, LA 4.1 \u00b1 0.5mMol/L while the group terlipressin: MAP 108 \u00b1 4mmhg, LA 2.1 \u00b1 0.2mMol/L.

Methods: 40 adult patients(pts), admitted to the intensive care unit with acute brain injury, bilateral non reactive mydriasis, Glasgow Coma Scale 3, absence of any reflection and potential progression to brain death. Pts were divided randomly into two groups: Hormonotherapy group (20 pts) treated with substitution hormonotherapy (triiodothyronine, vasopressin, methylprednisolone, insulin) and Control group (20 pts) with standard treatment. In all pts serial transesofageal echocardiography evaluations were performed with focus on systolic function, evaluated with ejection fraction of the left ventricle with Simpson's method. The echocardiographic exams were performed at entrance of the pts, post neurovegetative storm and within 12 hours after diagnosis brain death.

During the neurovegetative storm, we recorded a similar myocardial stunning. However, in group who used substitution hormonotherapy is shown a recovery of systolic function to almost basal level within 12 hours after brain death while in the control group remains a dysfunction in systolic function. Considering these pts as potential heart donors we have shown that substitution hormonotherapy improves systolic function, despite the stunning post neurovegetative storm. Introductions: Bedside alarms sound when vital sign (VS) exceed thresholds due to real instability (alerts) or artifact, leading to alarm fatigue. We used machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify alarms as alerts or artifacts in VS data streams to assess impact of such a filter on alert rate. Methods: Patients had VS monitoring data (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], oximetry [SpO2]) recorded at 1/20Hz. We partitioned data into training/validation (294 admissions; 22,980 hrs) and test sets (2,057 admissions; 156,177 hrs). Alarms are VS deviations beyond stability thresholds, and annotated as real alerts or artifact. We trained a random forest ML algorithm to discriminate alerts from artifact for long alarms (>3 min) and evaluated performance in the test set on both long and short alarms (<3 min) according to how many artifact alarms can be reduced among the total number of alarms (M1); and how many artifact alarms can be correctly filtered from the total artifact alarms (M2). Results: Figure 30 shows calculation of M1 (overall alarm duration reduction = 31 %) and M2 (artifact alarm duration reduction = 94 %) The number of artifact alarms in the complete data set is estimated from artifact prevalence in the annotated sample. Figure 31 is the ROC diagram for ML algorithm for both short and long alarms. Introductions: The use of peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) has notably increased in hospitalized, critically ill and ambulatory patients. However, it is important to understand the rationale and risks associated with this new technology. The aim of this study was to describe patterns of use and complications of PICCs, which were placed in the ICU setting. Methods: Prospective observational study carried out in a 500-bed general hospital with a 14-bed ICU, in which a specialized unit for catheter insertion is available. PICCs were implanted always in the middle third of the arm, following a protocol that includes strict sterile insertion procedure and echo-radiological control. Data of patients with PICCs inserted from January 2013 to April 2015 were collected, including demographics, characteristics of insertion, complications and outcomes. Descriptive data included frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) (25th-75th percentile) for quantitative variables. Introductions: A normal central venous pressure (CVP) waveform contains five components. These components include three peaks (a, c, v) and two descents (x, y). The characteristics and amplitude of the CVP waveform components change significantly during cardiovascular distress and its visualization can provide invaluable additional hemodynamic information. We described CVP tracings recorded during an episode of pulmonary hypertension in a porcine model of shock, aiming to characterize the CVP waveform morphology in conjunction with the simultaneous hemodynamic alterations.",

            "text": "This study was supported in part by an Innovation grant from the Dutch Kidney Foundation (grant nr. 14OIP11). Introductions: The use of ultrasound is recommended to secure central venous catheter placement in the ICU. However several surveys showed that only 50 % of the CVC procedures are performed using the ultrasound guided technique. The reason why physicians continue to use landmarks were the lack of formation and the absence of ultrasound device. We designed a survey to elicit information on physician's characteristics, experience in CVC placement, training on ultrasound technique, the use of ultrasound for CVC placement, reasons for non-use of ultrasound and their opinion on the necessity to continue to teach the landmark technique to residents. Methods: This survey (14 questions) has been electronically addressed by Email to every physician belonging to the BoReal group of research (8 university's and 20 community's ICU in the North-west of France). The survey was sent to the 289 physicians (166 seniors and 121 residents) working in those ICUs. Results: We received 190 responses (response rate 66 %). Among the respondents, 66 % were less than 40 years old, 34 % were residents, 41 % presented an experience in CVC placement < =5 years and 53 % declared putting more than 1 CVC per week. 71 % of the residents declared having learned both landmark and ultrasound guided techniques during their residency. Only 18 % reported using always the ultrasound to put CVC. The main reasons why they don't use ultrasound were 1) they think they don't need it (36 %), 2) the ultrasound was not available (33 %) while 3 % declare the absence of ultrasound device in their setting and 3) 11 % reported the absence of formation on ultrasound technique. Coagulation abnormalities (64 %), obesity (54 %) and anatomical difficulties (52 %) were the main motivations to use ultrasound reported. 53 % of the respondents declared having been confronted during the last 12 months to an urgent situation where the ultrasound was not available quickly enough. Finally 91 % think that the landmark technique should still be taught to the residents. Conclusions: Our survey shows that a large majority of the intensivists still perform landmark procedures while almost every physician received a formation on the ultrasound technique. Ultrasound device is present in the large majority of the institution however their availability is still scarce. Despite the several guidelines, physicians still don't use ultrasound for every procedure and think that landmark technique should still be taught to residents. Introductions: Central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (Pv-aCO2 or CO2 gap) is recognized as an index of global tissue perfusion. Additionally, the ratio of Pv-aCO2 by arterial-to-central venous O2 content difference (Ca-vO2), has been described as indicative of \u00a1\u00aeanerobiosis\u00a1\u00afin shock. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the predictive abilities of the Pv-aCO2 gap and Pv-aCO2/Ca-vO2 ratio in patients undergoing resuscitation from shock. Methods: Critically ill patients with shock who required vasopressors or inotropes were included in a prospective, observational study. Serial measurements of Pv-aCO2 gap, lactate, and Ca-vO2 were obtained at the time of starting the vasopressor/inotrope (time 0), then at times 3, 6 and 12 hours. The Study protocol was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (RAC No. 2151 048). Results: Fifty patients were enrolled. The mean APACHE II score was 26.9 \u00a1\u00c0 7.3. Thirty patients (60 %) had septic shock, 15 patients (30 %) had combined septic and cardiogenic shock, 3 patients (6 %) had hemorrhagic shock, and two patients (4 %) had cardiogenic shock. 28-day mortality rate was 62 % (31 patients). Fifteen patients (30 %) developed acute kidney injury. Patients surviving to day-28 had a lower Pv-aCO2 gap at time 0 (7.5, IQR 7 vs. 4.8, IQR 5, p = 0.007), and demonstrated greater clearance of the Pv-aCO2 gap during resuscitation (-0.75 IQR 4.8 vs. +0.75 IQR 5.2, p =0.024). A cut-off value of \u00a1\u00dd 6 mmHg significantly predicted 28 day mortality (75 % vs. 45.5 %, p =0.033). In a subgroup of patients in whom a resuscitative target of ScvO2 70 % was achieved, a higher Pv-aCO2 gap was significantly associated with lower 28-day survival (6.7 IQR 6 vs. 3.7 IQR 4, p =0.009). Pv-aCO2/Ca-vO2 ratios were significantly lower in patients surviving the ICU and until day-28 of follow up; this relationship was observed Conclusions: This study suggests that Pv-aCO2 gap and Pv-aCO2/ Ca-vO2 ratio can be used to predict mortality in shock, especially in patients for whom the usual goals of resuscitation have been achieved. A Pv-aCO2 gap value of 6 mmHg may be used as a reasonable cut-off point. Introductions: Measurements of cardiac output (CO), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) remain important parameters for the management of critically ill patients. Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) with thermodilution technique has been considered the clinical standard in measurements of CO. However, it is an invasive technique that can be associated with complications. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a non-invasive technique allowing to calculate the CO and the PAPS. We decided to compare the CO and SPAP measured by TTE and by PAC. Methods: We prospectively included all patients monitored with PAC, sedated and under mechanical ventilation in our ICU. We excluded patients with arrhythmias, severe valvulophathy and poor echogenicity. The CO, PAOP, right auricular pressure (RAP) and SPAP were measured using the PAC (-PAC). CO-PAC was an average of three thermodilutions. The TTE CO (COTTE) was derived from the Doppler stroke volume, the E/A ratio from the transvalvular mitral flow and the Ea from the mitral annular TDI. SPAP was estimated from tricuspid gradient (SPAPecho) plus RAP (estimated by inferior vena cava diameter). Measurements made with TTE and PAC were performed simultaneously by two experienced operators. A linear regression and a Bland-Altman analysis were performed. Results: 22 patients (36 measurements) were monitored with PAC, age 64y/o(60-70), SAPS 61(60-79), ejection fraction (EF) 58 %(46-61). The linear regression between COTTE and COPAC was R2 = 0.78 (P < 0.001). The Bland and Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.4 l/min and limits of agreement from -2.8 to 1.9 l/min. The linear regression between SPAPecho and SPAP-PAC was R2 = 0.52 (P < 0.001), the linear regression improves when SPAPecho was calculated from tricuspid gradient plus RAP measured by PAC R2 = 0.62 (P < 0.001). The Bland and Altman analysis showed a bias of -3.7 mmHg and limits of agreement from -18.1 to 10.7 mmHg. Linear regression between E/A and PAOP, E/Ea and PAOP were weak, R2 = 0.33 (P < 0.001) and R2 = 0.42 (P < 0.001) respectively. Conclusions: This study confirms that COTTE correlates well with the measurement of COPAC in critical care patients sedated under mechanical ventilation. The TTE estimation of SPAP appears also reliable. But the TTE estimation of PAOP (E/Ea and E/A) in this population of patient with unselected EF is not consistent. Introductions: The CNAP technology (CNSystems Medizintechnik AG, Graz, Austria) enables noninvasive continuous recording of the arterial pressure waveform based on the volume clamp method. Recently, the manufacturer released a novel algorithm for measuring cardiac output (CO) using pulse contour analysis of the arterial waveform. In this study, we compared CO measurements with CNAP (CNCO) with invasive CO measurements using intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution (pulmonary artery catheter (PAC); PAC-CO) in postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients. Methods: In this interim analysis, simultaneously obtained CNCO and PAC-CO measurements were analyzed in 30 patients during the first hours after cardiothoracic surgery. We performed 3 independent sets of 5 consecutive thermodilution measurements each per patient. The average of the 3 closest of the 5 PAC-CO measurements was used for comparison with the average of the corresponding CNCO values. Three pairs of measurements were excluded due to artifacts resulting in 87 paired measurements for analysis. In addition, 25 cardiac output-modifying maneuvers were analyzed to evaluate trending ability. We conducted 2 separate comparative analyses: 1) CNCO calibrated to the first simultaneously measured PAC-CO value (CNCOcal) vs. PAC-CO and 2) CNCO auto-calibrated to biometric patient data (CNCObio) vs. PAC-CO. Agreement between the two methods was statistically assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and by calculating the percentage error (PE). For evaluating trending ability, the concordance rate (CCR) was calculated. An exclusion zone of 0.5 L/ min was applied. Results: For CNCOcal, the Bland-Altman analysis resulted in a mean difference of -0.2 L/min, a standard deviation of \u00b10.5 L/min and limits of agreement of -1.1 to +0.7 L/min. The PE and CCR were 18 % and 100 %, respectively. For CNCObio, the Bland-Altman analysis resulted in a mean difference of +0.5 L/min, a standard deviation of \u00b11.1 L/ min and limits of agreement of -1.6 to +2.6 L/min. The PE and CCR were 43 % and 94 %, respectively. Conclusions: In this clinical study in patients after cardiothoracic surgery, CNCOcal showed good agreement (PE 18 %) and good trending ability (CCR 100 %) when compared with intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution. For CNCObio, we observed a higher PE (43 %) but acceptable trending ability (CCR 94 %). Introductions: A reliable hemodynamic monitoring and a correct interpretation of the data are of crucial importance in the patient (pts) with SS to choose the strategy of treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The aim of this prospective study was to compare two techniques of hemodynamic monitoring to assess which is more reliable in the management of pts in SS [1] . Methods: 20 adult pts in ICU for SS. All pts were monitored with CPCCO Pulsion Medical Systems and serial TEE have been performed. The cardiac output(CO;L/min) was measured continuously with the method CPCCO(triple injection of 15 ml of 0.9 % saline solution at 4\u00b0C in the CVC, thermo dilution curve measured in the femoral artery through the catheter thermistor dedicated) and simultaneously with TEE(LVOT area multiplied the integral speed/time of aortic flow multiplied by the heart rate) at the entrance, after fluid challenge with 500 ml of crystalloid and during the use of vasopressors and/or inotropic drug(VId). Same operator measured echocardiographic CO without being aware of the CO supplied by CPCCO. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For comparison and correlation between measurements were used linear regressions according to the Bland-Altman method. Statistical significance was considered at p \u2264 0.05. Results: 120 measurements were performed. 60 with CPCCO and 60 with the TEE. 40 measurements were realized at the entrance, 20 with CPCCO(1.8 \u00b1 0.2) and 20 with TEE(1.75 \u00b1 0.3), 40 after fluid challenge, 20 with CPCCO(2.5 \u00b1 0.3) and 20 with TEE(2.7 \u00b1 0.2), 40 during the use of vasopressors and/or inotropic drug including 20 with CPCCO(4.5 \u00b1 0.3) and 20 with TEE(4.4 \u00b1 0.2). There is a good correlation and a limited bias between measurements provided by CPCCO and by TEE, both at the entrance(r = 0.992,bias = 0.15), after fluid challenge (r = 0.954,bias = 0.24), both during the use of VId (r = 0.967,bias = 0.33). These values were statistically significant (p = 0.026).",

The AP-IJVD shows the best correlation with CVP. Introductions: Dehydration is a relatively unrecognized disorder in medical ICU especially among older patients. Our aim was to determine the incidence of dehydration upon admission as well as the risk of developing dehydration during hospitalization and its effect on patient outcome. Moreover, several lab parameters were studied in order to assess the correlation to the diagnosis. Methods: All patients entering ICU in a 6 month period in 2015 were enrolled and screened for dehydration on day 1 and day 3 using clinical and lab parameters (BUN, Cr, BUN/Cr ratio, Hct, serum Na, urine specific gravity). BUN/Cr >20 was used as a diagnostic criteria. Serum osmolality was not used due to unconsistent eligibility. In total of 332 patients, 38 were excluded due to GI haemorrhage. Finally, 294 patients were included, M/F 152/142, median age 74. Statistical methods used were McNemar test (differences in dehydration on day 1 and day 3), binary logistic analysis (association of lab parameters with dehydration) and multivariate adjusted binary logistic regression model (outcome). Results: Of 294 patients 126 (42.9 %) were dehydrated upon admission. Dehydration clinically diagnosed at admission and defined by BUN/Cr >20 were significantly associated (McNemar test; \u03c7 2 = 42.01; n = 246; p < 0.001; \u03d5 =0.24). Dehydration was correctly clinically recognised in 45/126 (35.7 %). Patients with BUN/Cr >20 had 3 times higher odds to be accurately clinically diagnosed. No correlation could be found between dehydration and values of Hct, serum Na and urine specific gravity. Statistically significant positive association was demonstrated for BUN (OR = 1.08; 95 % CI 1.04-1.11; p < 0.001) and Cr (OR = 1.00; 95 % CI 1.00-1.00; p = 0.048). On day 3 133/ 249 (54.1 %) patients were dehydrated which represents significant increase (McNemar test, \u03c7 2 with continuity correction = 7.01; n = 246; p = 0.008; \u03d5 = 0.45). Overall, dehydration at any point of stay was associated with adverse outcome (death) (OR adj = 2.45, 95%CI 1.38-4.34, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Dehydration is a common finding in ICU and can be clinically easily overlooked due to insensitivity of clinicians for milder forms of dehydration which could explain a relatively high rate of misclassification. Clinical and lab parameters are insufficient for diagnosis which is consistent with previous observations. According to these data, hydration status changes during ICU stay and it's fluctuations are associated with increased mortality suggesting that maintaining an adequate hydration status is of core interest for patient outcome. Methods: Patients were randomly allocated to receive 2, 3, 4 or 5 ml /kg (body weight) of intravenous crystalloid over five minutes. Pmsf was measured using the arterial pressure after stopping blood flow in the arm with a pneumatic tourniquet inflated for one minute. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were recorded at baseline and immediately after the fluid infusion. CO was measured with LiDCOplus monitor. A positive response was defined as an increase of 10 % from baseline. From previous data, the least significant change (LSC) for Pmsf was 14 %. Medians were compared using the independent samples media test, and proportions were compared using an exact fisher test. Statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05 Results: 40 patients were included, 40 % of them were responders. The changes (\u0394 ) of Pmsf and CO in each group are described in Table 20 . There is marginal evidence of \u0394 Pmsf is related to the dose of fluids, but the \u0394 CO and the proportion of responders are not affected by the dose of fluids infused Conclusions: The dose of fluids does not affect the change in CO or the proportion of responders to a fluid challenge in septic patients.",

Introductions: Emergency department (ED) patients admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may be at particular risk for volume overload related complications due to their infected lungs. This study used the Premier administrative database containing 17 % of US hospital discharges in 2013 to examine the association between a higher amount of fluids administered on day 1, hospital mortality and ventilator free days (VFD). Methods: CAP was defined as a bacterial pneumonia diagnosis present on admission in ED patients receiving chest x-ray and parenteral antibiotics on Day 1. Day 1 total fluid volume was stratified into quartiles. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and secondary outcome was VFDs over a 30 day period. To adjust for potential confounds, patients were stratified into 5 severity groups based on their modelled predicted mortality, and a propensity model for giving fluids was built using clinical characteristics, severity of illness scores, and ICD-9-CM codes present on admission for important acute and chronic conditions. Patients were then grouped by severity of illness quintiles of predicted risk of death for the CAP population. The association of fluid administration with outcome was assessed within each quintile of mortality risk using chi-square analysis. Results: 192,806 adult ED patients with CAP were analyzed. Patients were 51.3 % female with a mean age of 69. Overall mortality rate was 7.4 % with an average of 24.6 VFDs. After propensity adjustment by severity of illness, mean amount of fluid administered on day 1 ranged from 842 ml to 2,189 ml. Within the fifth severity quintile we found a significant difference in the hospital (22.5 %) vs. predicted (18.3 %) mortality rate in the highest fluid quartile. Similarly, within the fifth severity quintile, we found a significant difference in the number of VFDs in the highest fluid quartile (16.1) compared to the rest of the quartiles (19.3-20.3). Conclusions: For adult ED patients with CAP, we found significant associations between day 1 fluids and increased mortality and decreased VFDs in the highest fluid quartile and severity group, after adjusting for severity of illness and acuity level. This study may have identified the subset of ED patients who may benefit from a more restrictive fluid strategy when presenting to the hospital with CAP. Introductions: Administration of fluids is routine in management of ICU patients. However, controversies still exist with regard to the ideal type, dose and timing of iv fluid and a large amounts of evidence has shown that fluids can have deleterious effects on several organ functions, both from excessive amounts and from their non-physiological electrolyte composition (1). The aim of our study was to assess the negative impact of positive fluid balance on outcome in critically ill patients. Methods: Retrospective study for one year (July 2014 to June 2015), including all patients admitted in medico-surgical ICU for more than 48 hours. Demographic data, SAPS II and APACHE II scores were registered at the first day. Length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, use of extra renal therapy, RIFLE score and mortality were noted. Daily and cumulative fluid balance was registered at 48 h, 7th, 14th, 21st days and at discharge. Results: A total of 183 patients were included. Mortality rate was 41 %. Severity scores were 49 \u00b1 17 and 19 \u00b1 9 points respectively in SAPS II and APACHE II. Table 21 resume cumulative fluid balance. We noted a higher rate of septic shock, longer length of stay and mechanical ventilation duration in non-survivors group. The use of extra renal therapy was higher in non-survivors group (1 vs 11 p = 0.01). RI-FLE score and diuretics use were also higher in non-survivors group (1 vs 2 p = 0.03 end 7 vs 16 p = 0.041). Non-survivors also showed higher accumulated positive fluid balance. Conclusions: Fluid accumulation is very common throughout the course of a patient's ICU stay with the evidence of the potentially deleterious effects of fluids and electrolytes on many organ systems. A more conservative approach regarding fluid management strategy in ICU patient seems to be less deleterious, but randomized controlled trials addressing this issue were needed. Regarding the cFB and the respiratory system, it was found that patients with a ratio PO2/FiO2 < =200 had a higher cFB between the 4th and 8th day. In the group of patients who required vasopressor support, cFB was higher in the 2nd and 3rd days (p = 0.04 and p = 0.036, respectively). The group of patients with a GFR <75 ml/min/1.73 m2 presented cFB slightly higher than the group with higher GFR (2nd and 4th days p = 0.049 e p = 0.041, respectively).",

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with GI feeding intolerance, defined as high gastric residual volumes (GRV), diarrhoea or vomiting while receiving NG feeding in the ICU. The proportion of patients with each of high GRV, diarrhoea, and vomiting were secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Among mechanical ventilated patients receiving NG feeding, the use of PL-148 compared to saline did not reduce the proportion of patients developing GI feeding intolerance but was associated with a decreased incidence of high GRV. Introductions: Using buffered crystalloid fluids, such as Plasma-Lyte 148 (PL-148), may reduce post-operative blood loss and transfusion requirements compared to 0.9 % saline (saline) [2, 3] . However, no studies have assessed the effect on postoperative blood loss of using different crystalloid fluids after heart surgery. Objective: To evaluate the effect of PL-148 compared with saline on bleeding following heart surgery. Methods: We conducted a single centre pilot study nested within a multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, double crossover trial. All adult heart surgery patients who required crystalloid fluid therapy in ICU as part of the SPLIT trial [1] were eligible. The primary outcome was chest drain output from time of arrival to ICU until 12 hours post operatively. The key secondary outcomes were total volume of fluid in chest drains from arrival to ICU until 24 hours if still in ICU and proportions of patients requiring any of the following blood products (packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate). Results: 251 patients were enrolled, with 131 assigned to PL-148 and 120 to saline. There was no difference in postoperative chest drain output at 12 hours (ratio of geometric means, 1.06; 95 % CI, 0.93 to 1.20; P-value = 0.42) or at 24 hours. In the PL-148 group, 28 of 131 patients (30.5 %) required blood products in ICU compared with 22 of 120 patients (18.3 %) in the saline group (OR, 1.96; 95 % CI, 1.08 to 3.54; P = 0.03). Conclusions: Among patients admitted to ICU following heart surgery, the use of PL-148 compared to saline did not reduce the amount of post-operative blood loss but was associated with increased use of bloods products. Introductions: Approximately 1 to 2 % of patients attending the Emergency Department have hypernatremia (1) . Hypernatremia over 160 mmol/L is considered to be very severe and as such needs to be treated with caution (2) . Extreme cases of hypernatraemia are rare (where sodium levels are exceptionally high), especially in adults and the most common pathophysiology in such cases would be related to severe dehydration. We see this more in the elderly population, children, the institutionalised and patients with dementia.",

            "text": "We report a unique case of extreme hypernatremia of 196 mmol/L and severe sepsis in a young 39-year-old adult with Huntington's dementia, which presented a challenge in fluid management. Results: The hypernatraemia was thought to be caused by chronic severe dehydration from poor intake and the sepsis was thought to have started as an inadequately treated urinary tract infection. The patient was initially treated aggressively with hypotonic saline and intravenous antibiotics, but was subsequently managed using a slower correction rate after identifying the chronic nature of the natremia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extreme hypernatremia and severe sepsis manifesting concomitantly in such a young patient. Conclusions: We highlight the difficulties of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid versus slow fluid resuscitation in such complex clinical situations. We highlight the difficulty of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid fluid resuscitation, necessitated by severe sepsis and acute kidney injury, against the complexities of fluid resuscitation in correcting such an extreme hypernatremia. We advocate early identification of chronic hypernatremia and effective administration of intravenous fluids in the Emergency Department that is decided on a case-by-case basis. In cases of severe and extreme hypernatraemia in particular, accurate calculation of free water deficit is essential to manage the patient effectively. In line with this, we must ensure that such patients are always weighed on admission. Introductions: HAGMA is a commonly encountered acid-base disorder in clinic practice. Multiple mnemonics were proposed to cover the common underlying causes -\"GOLDMARK(1)\", \"KUSMALE\", \"KAR-MEL\" and, of course, \"MUDPILES\". The \"I\" in \"MUDPILES\" represents some rare causes of HAGMA including \"I\"ron, \"I\"soniazid and \"I\"nborn errors of metabolism. We present a rare case of HAGMA secondary to isoniazid (INH) overdose. Methods: A 41 year old male was intubated for status epilepticus. He had a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis (pTB) and had been treated with a course of rifampicin, INH and ethambutol since 6 months ago. Results: Arterial blood gas in the Emergency Department showed severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis; pH 6.76, pCO2 80, pO2 62, HCO3 11, BE -24. The initial anion gap was 26. Physical examination was unremarkable except for fever and hypotension. Neurological examination did not reveal any lateralising signs. CT scan of the brain was normal. Mild renal impairment, and lactate acidosis resolved rapidly with initial fluid resuscitation. Serum and urine toxicology for commonly encountered drugs were also negative. Patient regained orientation on day 3 of intubation and was promptly extubated. Further history revealed that he had consumed a bottle of isoniazid tablets after an altercation with his wife the same night. Conclusions: Tuberculosis is endemic is South East Asia. INH is one of the four drugs used in the treatment of this disease. Side effects of isoniazid range from mild hepatotoxicity to the potentially fatal INH hepatitis. HAGMA refractory to conventional therapy is one of the hallmarks of INH toxicity. Though it is one of the rare causes of HAGMA, prompt diagnosis and treatment with high dose pyridoxine (2) reduces mortality and morbidity.",

            "text": "Introductions: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with increased mortality in the critically ill, especially when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required. \"Early initiation\" of RRT and its possible beneficial effect on mortality, has been the focus of many research protocols. However, published papers show no uniformity in the definition of early initiation. The main problem to determine this best moment of initiation is the lack of a distinctive parameter that can predict RRT requirement. The question rises if differences between patients with any stage of AKI and patients with RRT-requiring AKIN stage III can be identified looking at the \"classical parameters\" (serum creatinine (SCr), urea, potassium, bicarbonate, pH, cumulative fluid balance), plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (pNGAL) and urinary output (UO) at the time of first rise in SCr (first AKI). Methods: This is a retrospective subset-analysis performed on the NGAL-study database [1] in adult critically ill patients with developing AKI. Data were collected and analyzed at the time of first AKI and at the highest level of serum creatinine (peak AKI). Mann-Whitney-U test was used to detect differences between both groups. Results: A total of 59 patients developed any stage of AKI during the first 7 days after ICU admission, 15 patients required RRT eventually. At the time of first AKI, pNGAL and UO were the only parameters that differed significantly (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 respectively) between the two groups. The \"classical parameters\" showed a significant difference between groups later on at the time of peak AKI (=time of RRT initiation) (Fig. 37) . Conclusions: Critically ill patients with RRT requiring AKI have a significant lower urinary production and significant higher pNGAL concentration compared to patients with non-RRT requiring AKI at the time of first rise in SCr. The \"classical parameters\" fail to make this distinction at this very early stage of AKI. Therefore, plasma NGAL and UO might have the potential (perhaps in combination with the Furosemide stress test) to become valuable parameters in future prospective protocols that intend to study the value of early RRT initiation on hard outcome measures in critically ill patients. Introductions: The choice for the right renal replacement therapy (RRT) for severe acute kidney injury in critically ill patients has been investigated many times in the last two decades. Although some questions have been answered, in current practice many different approaches are still used in the ICU. The authors review the treatment of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in critically ill patients, indications for SLED and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients in four Portuguese ICUs. Methods: Prospective observational study conducted in 4 ICUs in 3 Portuguese hospitals for seven months. All patients with AKI who needed a renal replacement therapy were enrolled. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were collected at baseline. Results: 127 patients were enrolled, with an average age of 61,3 \u00b1 15,26, and mortality rate was 46 %. 42 patients performed SLED (33,07 %), and 85 % performed CRRT (63,97 %). The most common indications for CRRT was fluid overload (47,76 %). Most of the patients start the both procedures in the first two days in ICU. Most of the patients (59 \u00d0 60 %) were in organ failure, using the RIFLE criteria when they started RRT. Patients in CRRT were more hemodynamically unstable (norepinephrine in CRRT \u00d0 1,99 \u00b1 5,36 and in SLED -1,49 \u00b1 4,56). Mortality rate \u00d0 52,94 % in CRRT and 30,95 in SLED. Conclusions: CRRT seems to be the ideal mode of renal replacement therapy for hemodynamically unstable with fluid overloaded. However, in expert hands, the two treatments provide similar outcomes and can be complementary. We wished to evaluate current practice in the region and consider the need for regional guidance on the management of acute kidney injury in our units. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to all the consultants in intensive care within the region. Responses were anonymously collecting using internet-based survey software. Questions were based upon the currently available guidance and evidence. Results: Invitations were sent to 139 consultants who have some intensive care commitment. There were 55 responses giving a response rate of 39.6 %. Unit size varied greatly, from under 10 beds, to over 20. The majority (43.6 %) had between 10 and 20 beds. 46.3 % of respondents had less than 10 patients receiving RRT per month, 40.7 % had between 10 and 25 patients per month and 13 % had more than 25 patients per month. 43 % gave positive comments regarding the support they receive from renal services. Some areas where interactions between renal physicians and critical care could be improved were identified. Only 67 % of respondents were aware of an up to date guideline for the use of RRT in their unit. 1.9 % of respondents preferentially use the subclavian vein for siting renal access lines. 9.3 % preferentially used the femoral veins. 31 % never have visits from a nephrologist. Conclusions: There is a wide variety in practice, with some areas where practices could be improved , notably awareness of guidelines available, choice of renal access line site, and working relationships between renal and critical care. As part of a quality improvement programme, we plan to create a regional best practice recommendations document that is relevant to the systems in which we work and specific to critical care. By doing this, we hope to improve outcomes for those receiving renal replacement therapy in our units. Introductions: Acute kidney injury necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients is associated with high mortality. Timing of CRRT remains a matter of debate. We investigated the effect of timing of CRRT on 28-day mortality. Methods: A post-hoc analysis is performed on the multicenter data from the earlier published CASH study. In critically ill patients receiving CRRT, between 2005 and 2011, the effect of variables at initiation of CRRT on 28-day mortality were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to determine renal and patient-specific variables associated with 28-day mortality. Results: Of the 139 patients evaluated for inclusion, 13 patients were excluded because of a history of chronic kidney disease, 5 patients were excluded because no creatinine at CRRT initiation was available, and 5 patients were excluded because an admission creatinine below 50 \u03bcmol/L. In the 116 included patients, 28-day mortality was 37 (32 %). In univariate proportional hazards cox regression analysis, ICU admission after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( HR 4.403, p = 0.043), SOFA score ( HR 1.117, p = 0.024) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.997, p = 0.020) were associated with 28-day mortality. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (HR 1.092, p = 0.050), admission weight ( HR 1.036, p = 0.016) ICU admission because of respiratory failure (HR 9.275, p = 0.29) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.990, p = 0.022) were associated with 28-day mortality. After correction for disease severity scores, such as APACHE 2 score and SOFA score, and markers for fluid overload, such as hematocrit and cumulative fluid balance, creatinine at initiation remained associated with lower 28mortality. Even after correction for admission creatinine, only creatinine at initiation remained associated with 28-day mortality. In ROC curve analysis a CRRT initiation creatinin of 318 \u03bcmol/L was the best predictor for 28-day mortality. Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, creatinine at CRRT initiation is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality, even after correction for admission creatinine, disease severity and hemodilution. Therefore these data argue in favour of a time-dependent effect of CRRT on 28day mortality. These data suggest that late CRRT initiation may have better outcome then earlier CRRT initiation. However further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and reveal underlying mechanisms.",

Ward 1 Introductions: CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) provides long filter running times and effective dialysis doses. Thus, the risk of hypophosphatemia (hypoPO4) is high and PO4 substitution is required. We investigated whether separate infusion of PO4 or a PO4-containing dialysis fluid is more effective to avoid severe hypoPO4. Methods: Retrospective-prospective observational study in a university hospital. CRRT with RCA-CVVHD (30 ml/kg/h). PO4 substitution via a separate infusion (PO4-I; retrospective data); use of a PO4containing dialysate (CiCa dialysate K4, Fres. Medical Care)(PO4-D, prospective data). Primary outcome: incidence of severe hypoPO4. Secondary outcome: maintenance of normal PO4-levels, duration of mechan. ventilation and length stay in the ICU (with approval of local ethics committee, NCT01946113 ally ill patients requiring CRRT but contraindicated for heparin. Exclusion criteria:liver disease, liver injury, noradrenaline >0.5mcg/kg/min, ideal body weight >90 kg, receiving >6 u/hr of insulin, sodium <120 or >160 mmol/l, pH >7.5 or bicarbonate > 40 mmol/l. Primary outcome measure-filter time Secondary outcome measures:calcium replacement; Post filter ionised calcium (iCa); acid base status and serum sodium levels. A dose choice of 25 or 35 mls/ kg/min with parallel changes to the filtration fraction from 20 to 25 % as required to manage metabolic alkalosis. If metabolic alkalosis persisted, RCA was stopped. Acid Citrate Dextrose Forumula-A (ACD-A) (113 mmol/L of citrate) is administered at a weight related rate aiming for a citrate concentration of 2.5-3 %. Replacement fluid is Accusol 35 (1.75 mmol/l calcium). A post filter solution of 10 mmol/l calcium chloride is administered according to post filter ionized calcium (iCa).Bicarbonate, iCa and sodium measured at 3 to 6 hourly intervals during therapy. Introductions: The Ci-Ca CVVHD is a successfully implemented protocol in several European countries to conduct CRRT in patients with AKI [1] . This protocol recommends a calcium chloride solution (CaCl-S) for calcium supplementation. Due to non-availability of CaCl-S, we modified this approach and used a calcium gluconate solution (CaGl-S) instead. Methods: The Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol [1] relies on modifying the calcium substitution to control s-iCa, which we applied analogously in our modified protocol. Further in the Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol, the ratio between dialysate flow (Qd) and blood flow (Qb) is linked to the effect on the acid-base status and typically set to 33 %, which we essentially applied throughout the study using 3 l/h dialysate flow at 150 ml/min blood flow. Systemic ionized Ca (s-iCa)and acid-base parameters were closely monitored to ensure safe application of our modified protocol. We retrospectively analyzed 14 critically ill patients. Results: With respect to systemic iCa, our patients group had low values at start of Ci-Ca CVVHD, which might already explain the higher required amount of CaGl-S compared to literature data assuming that a calcium deficit in the patients is filled up, see Fig. 39 . Concerning acid-base results, we did see a slight tendency to alkalosis after prolonged Ci-Ca CVVHD with CaGl-S, see Fig. 40 . This might well be attributed to gluconate metabolism yielding some additional bicarbonate. Conclusions: We successfully established use of a CaGl-S with the Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol. Noting the slight trend to alkalosis, we have decided to slightly reduce the blood flow to 130 ml/min. This will reduce citrate needs and less citrate will be metabolized by the patient to bicarbonate. Table 24 as median (lower and upper quartiles). All patients were non-responding to the Standard of Care for the treatment of severe sepsis/septic shock. Therefore, CytoSorb was used as adjunctive therapy in combination with continuous renal replace therapy (CRRT), in order to control the cytokines storm and improve the hemodynamic stability. It was installed in series connection after the dialyser in the CRRT circuit for 24 h (median duration of the treatment: 48 h). Clinical parameters were collected before and after every treatment with CytoSorb. Introduction: This study quantifies the ability of CytoSorb\u00ae hemoadsorbent polymer beads to adsorb a broad selection of inflammatory pathogen-and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs & DAMPS) and cytokines from whole blood in an in vitro recirculation system. PAMPS cause either direct damage or trigger an immune response in the host to fight infection leading to the production of high levels of cytokines and the release of DAMPS into the bloodstream, which can trigger a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that can contribute to organ injury. The benefits of cytokine reduction using extracorporeal blood filtration with hemoadsorbant porous polymer beads has been demonstrated in septic animals, yet the adsorption of other toxins and inflammatory factors may also contribute to the observed benefits. Methods: Purified proteins were added to whole blood and recirculated through a CytoSorb\u00ae device or control device for 5 hours. Plasma was analyzed by ELISA. Results: Hemoperfusion of whole blood through porous polymer bead devices for 5 hours removed substantial quantities of a broad spectrum of DAMPS, PAMPS (Table 25 ) and cytokines (ns). Levels of the inflammatory proteins were reduced by <20 % during the five hour hemoperfusion through a control device (ns).",

            "text": "Deterioration of CrCl/GFR identifies patients with acute kidney injury and is important for appropriate drug dosing. In our ICU practice the MDRD-eGFR equation is standard of care for a \"reliable\" estimation of GFR. Recently, the CKD-EPI-SCr equation was introduced as a more accurate measure especially in patients with higher GFRs. However, in critical ill patients there is no steady state of SCr, which is a prerequisite in order to estimate GFR irrespective of the mathematical formula used. We regularly treat patients with demonstrably highly impaired kidney function in spite of \"normal\" estimated GFR leading to toxic levels of renally cleared drugs. We investigated the actual practice of GFR approximation in Dutch ICUs. Introduction: The serum-creatinine based estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the MDRD-equation is inaccurate in critically ill patients and tends to severely overestimate the \"real time clearance capacity\" especially in catabolic states. Recently, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C equations were introduced as more precise alternatives for eGFR. Originally, all these equations have been validated in patients with stable chronic kidney disease. Most Dutch hospital laboratories, ours included, still report MDRD-eGFR in their electronic patient data system, however many intend to, or already have switched to CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR. To date, (e)GFR is a key element in clinical decision making, even in the ICU setting. However, indiscriminate application of these mathematical equations may be questionable in the critically ill. Methods: In order to calculate GFR applying MDRD, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C formulae and assess their mutual comparability in an all-comer adult academic ICU cohort we performed a post-hoc analysis from the NGAL-study. MDRD-eGFR, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C-eGFR were calculated using admission-day data. Man-Whitney U test was used for comparison between groups. Introduction: Patients hospitalized for septic shock have an increased risk to develop acute renal failure (ARF) and require a renal replacement therapy (RRT). The best delay to start RRT is a matter of debate. A new urine test, the Nephrocheck TM has been validated. It corresponds to the urine concentration product of 2 tubular suffering markers (TIMP2 and IGFBP7) associated with a risk of developing an ARF within 12 hours. The aim of our study was to analyze the capacity of the urine TIMP2*IGFBP7 to predict the absence of evolution toward the AKIN 3 in patients hospitalized for a septic shock who present an ARF AKIN 1 or 2.",

Introduction: Gynae-oncological surgery involves a patient population that is elderly, undergoing intra-abdominal surgery sometimes with tumour extension to the ureters; long anaesthetic and surgical times with extensive blood loss. All of these factors have been highlighted in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) as factors for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) [1] . The incidence of AKI in the gynaecological population is thought to be about 13 % [2] . Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways incorporate the use of goal directed fluid therapy with cardiac output monitoring perioperatively. Our study aim was to look at the incidence of AKI before and after the introduction of an ERAS pathway in our centre. Methods: We retrospectively looked at patients undergoing major gynae-oncological surgery before and after the introduction of an ERAS pathway. There was no patient exclusion in our cohort. We used the KDIGO definition of AKI using the patient's preoperative serum creatinine as baseline. Serum creatinine on admission to the critical care unit was taken as day 1. Data was collected for day 1, 3, 7 and 30. The main outcome of the study was the incidence of AKI pre and post ERAS introduction. Contingency analysis using Yates Chi-squared was performed.",

Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent contributor to morbidity and mortality [1] . In view of this we evaluated factors that may be associated with the development of AKI after hip and knee arthroplasty and studied the subsequent effect AKI had on length of stay (LOS) and mortality. [2] . It is possible that this may be secondary to the routine post-operative admission of patients with risk factors to the HDU environment. Risk factors found to be associated with AKI were consistent with the results of previous studies [3] . Even Stage 1 AKI resulted in an increased mortality at one year. Interpretation of our findings is limited by confounding. Early recognition of risk factors will aid identification of patients at increased risk of AKI. Subsequent pre-optimisation and normalisation of reversible risk factors where possible as well as planning of appropriate post-operative care may reduce the burden of AKI.

In all hospital survivors mean eGFR rose significantly from baseline to discharge: 88.4 to 94.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (p < 0.001). However in those with AKI discharge eGFR was similar to baseline 76.4 to 74.5 (p = 0.6). 1225 patients stayed > =5 days after surgery in those with AKI mean creatinine rose rapidly and eventually settled to near baseline however overall creatinine fell progressively in the five days after surgery and was 10 % below baseline at discharge (Fig. 46) . In a regression analysis a higher discharge eGFR significantly correlated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.001), however no such relationship existed for baseline eGFR (p = 0.79). Conclusions: Baseline reduction in serum creatinine after major surgery may confound our ability to identify AKI and to assess its severity and recovery. Importantly, these effects may be more pronounced in patients with longer hospital admissions who are at higher risk of complications including AKI. Introduction: Despite of the advances in the critical care diagnosis and treatment, the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) remains high. In cardiac surgery AKI is reported to be around 30 % with need for renal replacement therapy up to 1 %. [1] We aim to characterize the differences in premorbid status, etiology, intraoperative and postoperative influencing factors for AKI development and the patients' secondary outcomes. Methods: Single center retrospective observational sturdy, AKI was determined from Acute Kidney Injury Network as an acute (within 48 h) deterioration in renal functions when serum creatinine concentration entirely increase to value of greater than 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 \u03bcmol/L) from baseline or 1.5-fold increment from baseline) [2] . Patients divided into 2 groups, group I without AKI (544 patients) and group II with AKI (181 patients). The patients admission database were recorded as well as the secondary outcome measures. Results: The mean age was 52.7 \u00b1 11.6 years. We reported high AKI association in our settings (25 %). The AKI group match the other group with respect to age, gender, body mass index, the association of diabetes or hypertension. AKI group had significantly higher additive Euro Score 6 \u00b1 4 vs 4 \u00b1 2, lower ejection fraction 47 \u00b1 11 vs 50 \u00b1 9 ( P = 0.00 and 0.00 respectively. Lengths of ventilation, stays in ICU and in hospital were significantly higher in the AKI group. The AKI group with post-operative atrial fibrillation 29.8 % vs 10.5 % (p = 0.001). AKI group had significantly higher mortality 6 % vs group I 1.7 % (p = 0.026). Interestingly, AKI was more prominent in Asian group than Arab 92(50.8 %) vs 77(42.5 %) P = 0.04 The independent risk factors for AKI in our population were additive Euro Score, cardiopulmonary bypass time, post-operative low hemoglobin, postoperative white cell count and total blood loss. Conclusions: Cardiac surgery induced AKI is highly predominant and prognostically substantial. Therapies targeting preoperative anemia, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative red blood cell transfusions, may display guard against this complication. Introduction: Acute kidney injury is a common complication after major surgery that has been associated with adverse outcomes. Methods: A retrospective study of major non-cardiac surgery in a teaching hospital over an 18 month examining the incidence of AKI with one-year follow-up. AKI was defined by KDIGO creatinine criteria. Major surgery was defined as inpatient procedures of >1 h duration. To assess the independent effect of AKI on survival, a multivariable Cox proportional-hazard survival model was developed. Results: 1897 patients were included, post-operative AKI occurred in 128 (6.8 %), of these 101 had KDIGO stage 1 (5.4 %), 19 stage 2 (1 %) and 8 stage 3 (0.4 %). Patients who developed AKI were significantly older, had a lower baseline eGFR, were in a higher ASA class and spent longer in hospital post-operatively compared to those without AKI. Hospital Mortality occurred in 17/128 (13.3 %) of patients that developed AKI post-operatively compared to only 16/ 1741 (0.9 %) of those that did not (p < 0.001). However by a year of surgery 34/94 (27 %) of patients who developed post-operative AKI had died compared to only 106/1741 (6 %) who had not had AKI (Fig. 47) , p < 0.001. In the multi-variable model accenting for multiple confounders AKI was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 3.0 (1.91-4.72) in the year after surgery. Importantly AKI defined by only a 26 \u03bcmol/L creatinine rise and AKI with recovery remained associated with on-going ibcreased risk of death to one year. Conclusions: In major surgery patients we have demonstrated an association between even mild acute kidney injury and increased risk of death in the next year. Introduction: Early detecting acute renal failure in intensive care units is important by the aspect of determination of the disease's severity and grade of the organ dysfuncion, discharging the patient from the intensive care units and decreasing mortality rate. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative workgroup proposed a classification system for acute kidney injury (AKI) identified by the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease). The purpose of our study is to assess acute renal failure development in intensive care units patients, factors affecting it and the effect of the factors over mortality via using RIFLE score. Methods: The age, height, weight, gender, diagnosis, comorbid diseases, admission reason to the intensive care and intensive care stay were recorded. Also in the first day, in the seventh day and in the 14.day after admission to the intensive care, the APACHE II score, SOFA score, RIFLE score, biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, HCO3-level), triceps thickness and waist circumference measurement were all recorded. Patients was grouped into AKI and non-AKI. Patients in non-AKI group had no oliguria and obvious creatinine rise, while patients in AKI group had oliguria and obvious creatinine rise. The AKI group was assessed by RIFLE score due to hourly urine output, creatinin rise and seperated into three groups as R = Risk, I = Injury, F = Failure. Results: Our study was carried out with 502 patients. 39,2 % of the patients was in the acute kidney \u00fdnjury group while %60.8 was in non-acute kidney \u00fdnjury group. acute kidney \u00fdnjury group was consisting of % 21,3 (n = 107) R group, % 12,4 (n = 62) I group and % 5,6 (n = 28) F group. The renal failure development is related with high age, short body height, excessive weight, existence of chronic disease and long intensive care units hospitalization period. As a result of our study renal failure was also related with high urea, creatinine, HCO3-levels, low cholesterol, albumine and prealbumine levels. Renal failure was not related with triceps thickness measurement. Intensive care units hospitalization stay and mortality were higher in patients who develop renal failure. Conclusions: we think that patients especially in intensive care units with high age, excessive weight, chronic diseases, high urea, creatinine, HCO3-levels, low cholesterol, albumine and prealbumine levels are prone to renal failure. Those patients should be carefully followed for renal failure. 96.9 \u00b1 0.002 % and 96.7 \u00b1 0.002 %, respectively. Mean survival time of the graft was 47.87 \u00b1 0.07 months in these patients and survival rates of the graft for 3,6,9,12,24,36 and 48 months were 99.2 \u00b1 0.001 %; 99 \u00b1 0.001 %; 98.7 \u00b1 0.001 %; 98.5 \u00b1 0.001 %; 97.6 \u00b1 0.002 %; 96.7 \u00b1 0.002 % and 96.3 \u00b1 0.003 %, respectively. Conclusions: In recent years, there is a significant increase in livekidney transplantations in our country, due to inadequte obtaining of organ from cadaver. We observed a quite high patient and graft survival times and a low chronic rejection incidence in our livekidney transplantation patients. Although there is a high life quality and better graft function in live-kidney transplantations compared to cadaver-kidney transplantations, cadaver-kidney transplantations should be increased. Introduction: Difficult intubation and extubations remains the most important problem in anaesthesia of patients with neck phlegmon [1, 3] . Old guidelines for airway flow [2, 3] does not fully satisfy the anesthesia procedures in patients with the neck phlegmon. We should create safe algorithm for intubation and extubation in that patients.",

In main group (n = 38) intubation was performed using fibrobronhoskope or Flaplight laryngoscope with video-adapter. Tracheostomy was not performed. Sedation was by deksmedetomidine infusion. In control group (n = 37) intubation was made by conventional laryngoscope and early tracheostomy followed by surgery. Sedation by thiopental Na or propofol. Results: The laryngoscope Flap-Flight upgraded with video-adapter was more efficient in case of difficult intubation. Early tracheostomy was associated with absolutely risk of mediastenitis (28,0 %) (95%CI: 0,14-0,47) in comparison with patients without tracheostomy. Dexmedetomidine was more effectiveness method for sedation which reduced reaction of cardiovascular system from 86 % to 9,5 % (\u03c7 =24,44; \u00d0 < 0,01). In control group was 13,5 % of postextubation ARF in comparison with 0.3 % in main group. Postponed extubation was performed from 10 to 72 hours after decreasing inflammatory, larynges edema, and trizm. Intubation algorithm: 1. Evaluate risk difficult intubation, trizm and stridor; 2. Perform laryngoscopy and classify by Kormack-Lehane: III-IV grade -use fibrobronchoscope; 3. In case of opening mouse to 1,5 cm, unable to use fibrobronchoscope -perform tracheostomy under LA. 4. In case cannot ventilate-cannot intubate surgery airway. Exctubation algorithm:1. Postponed extubation (10-72 hrs) is recommended; 2. For sedation use dexmedetomidin infusion rate 1,5-3 mqg/kg/hrs. Conclusions: The algorithm of anesthesiologist's actions was created to provide the safe airway flow in intra-and postoperative period of patients with neck phlegmon, which reduced the incidence of serious intubations from 51,4 % to 7,9 %, failed intubations from 19 % to 0,3 %, mediastinitis from 27 % to 2,6 %, deaths from 32,4 % to 2,6 % and mortality due to traheostomy from 32 % to 6,3 %.",

Bhandari Glan Clwyd Hospital, Rhyl , UK Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P220 Introduction: Nasal high flow oxygen (NHFO) is an attractive therapy for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), with reported comfort, and theoretical wash-out of CO2 and generation of PEEP. However, its clinical efficacy is uncertain. We undertook a systematic review of current evidence to support its use in adults. Methods: Medline and EMBASE were searched using the terms: nasal AND (high-flow OR high flow) AND (oxygen OR oxygen therapy. RCTs were included if comparison was made between NHFO and standard O2 therapy, or NHFO and CPAP or NIV, for AHRF in adults, and primary outcomes (intubation and mortality) reported on. Results: We identified 468 potentially relevant studies. 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria. There were important differences in patient groups, interventions and outcome measurements, precluding meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in intubation rate or mortality between intervention groups, with the exception of Frat (2015) , who demonstrated significantly reduced 90d mortality in NHFO compared with standard O2 and NIV groups, and lower intubation rate on post hoc analysis of patients with lowest PF ratio. Conclusions: There is only limited evidence from RCTs at present to support use of NHFO rather than conventional therapy for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in adults, and further study of patients at risk of requiring invasive ventilation is needed.",

We present preliminary data from a clinical study that aims to describe physiological effects of HFNC at different flow rates. Methods: We performed a prospective randomized cross-over study on This indicates that each set of data (n = 10) are normally distributed and therefore dosing is consistent. It may be concluded from this study that delivery of aerosol to adults at both high and low gas flow rates via NHF therapy is an efficient and highly reproducible means of administration. Introduction: Here we present an improved theoretical version of a valve for transtracheal ventilation as a bi-directional manual respiratory pump where a combination of low flow during inspiration, by reducing gas supply to the valve, and increased flow during expiration, by increasing gas supply to the valve, permits more effective venturi effect and efficient expiration, with low total gas consumption. Methods: The theoretical performance of the valve was modeled mathematically and the model was tested in vitro with a standard valve but by variable flow rates (Fig. 52) .",

Variable flow would provide shortening of the inspiratory time and efficient expiratory aid, and permit I:E ratios of 1:1, or even the inverse ratio ventilation. Conclusions: Satisfactory lung ventilation can be assured with transtracheal ventilation with a bidirectional manual respiration valve with variable gas flow. Conclusions: Long-term survival in patients selected for PMV with tracheostomy after failure to wean was not significantly different from that of weaned patients with tracheostomy. This suggests that survival of these patients depends more on the underlying disease(s) than on the ventilation itself. Despite the physical QoL scores being low in both groups, mental QoL was still acceptable. Recently, ultrasound has emerged as a potentially useful tool to assist PDT as it helps to identify the most appropriate location for the tracheal puncture site, guide needle insertion into the trachea, and may significantly reduce procedure-related complications.",

A two intensivists team followed up daily the patients discharged with tracheostomy from the ICU to the general ward until they were discharged from the hospital. Training sessions to the ward,s staff (doctors, nurses and nursing assistants) were made about tracheostomy cares every week. We analized clinical and epidemiologic variables, time to decannulation, complications related to the tracheostomy, decannulation failures, readmissions and mortality. Results: From February 2012 to October 2015, a total of 2568 patients were admitted to our ICU; during this period, 100 patients were discharged to the regular ward with tracheostomy tube in place. Of these, 68 % had neurological damages (due to head injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic events), 14 % chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 8 % severe miopathy, 6 % postanoxic encephalopathy, 2 % Guillain Barre and 2 % amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 10 % of the patients with a high length of stay had complications because of the tracheostomy (tracheal stenosis, granuloma and malacia), and all of them were solved. There were 2 readmissions to the ICU due to cannula obstruction. Decannulation at the ward was possible in 36 % of the patients, none of them had to be recannulated and all survived. Global mortality was 23 %, but excluding the patients under palliative cares, the mortality decreased to 5 % and the causes of death were not directly related to the tracheostomy. Conclusions: In hospitals without a step-down unit and a high healthcare demand the monitoring of the tracheostomized patients by a skilled team let to decannulate the patients at the ward with safety. It would allow discharge sooner this kind of patients from the ICU and therefore decrease the length of stay, the complications associated to the ICU admission and accordingly the costs. On the other hand, once at the ward, the team can detect early the complications, solve them and create a safety atmosphere for the patient, the family and the staff in charge. In the 2nd group, our study revealed the following complications: complication of subcutaneous emphysema -6 cs (17.1 %), but pneumomediastinum -2 cs (5.7 %), lobar emphysema -1 cs (2.8 %), suppurations -2 cs (5.7 %), situations that were resolved. All children received a special critical care under the Protocol of pneumonia prophylaxis associated with artificial ventilation: gentle suctioning of secretions with closed suction systems after cuffinflation. Placing on 30\u00b0and oral hygiene for 2-3 times/day being mandatory for each one. Also, a daily hydroelectrolitic rebalancing, calculation of individual energy need and symptomatic therapy was performed. Along with the improvement of general condition, appearance or improvement of the deglutition reflex, the oral nutrition with semi-solid preparations recommenced in 5 children (22.5 %) from the first day of tracheostomy application, in 7 cs the nutrition recommenced on 3-5 day together with partial parenteral nutrition until the full resumption of oral nutrition. It is worth noticing also the significant decrease in length of stay on artificial respiration in the 2ndgroup of children (22 \u00b1 0.9 days) compared to the 1stgroup (37 \u00b1 1.7 days). Despite the complex therapeutic effort, due to severity of basic disease in the 1 group 15 (24.5 %) children died and in the 2nd group 3 children (8.5 %) died. Conclusions: 1.The application of tracheotomy in patients with endotracheal intubation and prolonged artificial ventilation reduces the infant mortality rate. 2. In the 2 group we have noticed the decrease of the duration of treatment, which leads to a reduction in the prime cost of the child treated in the intensive care unit.",

Non invasive continuous airway positive pressure (CPAP) has been validated as effective treatment in addition to pharmacological therapy. The aim of study is to compare non invasive pressure support ventilation (PSV-NIV) and CPAP in this setting of patients. Methods: From 1 september 2015 to 15 november 2015, 24 patients were admitted to emergency department (ED) for ACPE. All patients were treated with standard medical therapy. In addition, 12 patients were treated with CPAP (group A) and 12 were treated with NIV-PSV (group B). Arterial hemogasanalysis was performed at admission (t0) and after 30 minutes from the beginning of ventilation treatment (t30\u2032) to evaluate pH, pO2/FiO2, pCO2 and lactate cleareance (lactate t0-lactate t30\u2032/lactate t0). Results: We enrolled 24 patients (10 men and 14 women). The median (o average) age was 74 years. Baseline characteristics of patientes were: sistolic blood pressure 180 mmhg, diastolic blood pressure 102 mmhg, pO2/FiO2 181, Ph 7,21, pCO2 53 mmhg, lactate 3,4 meq/l. After 30 minutes of CPAP, we noticed in group A patients an improvement of 52 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,02 points in pH value, a reduction of 10 % in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 28 %, in group B an improvement of 120 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,13 points in pH value, a reduction of 20%in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 35 %. No patients required endotracheal intubation. Two patients in A group, after 30 minutes of CPAP, shifted in PSV-NIV because of increase of pCO2. Conclusions: The preliminary results of our ongoing trial have shown a better outcome at t30\u2032 in patients affected by ACPE treated with PSV-NIV compared to those treated with CPAP in lactate clearance, improvement of pO2/FiO2 ratio, pH and pCO2 value. No differences in side effects between two groups were shown. Introduction: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is commonly used as a first line therapy for immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, although it may not be appropriate for every patient. Failure of NIV is an independent predictor of mortality and delayed endotracheal intubation may worsen prognosis. We report our center's experience and outcomes for patients with active haematologic malignancy treated with NIV. Eight patients had a \"do not intubate\" status due to their comorbidities. The most frequent reason to perform NIV was bacterial pneumonia (44 %) followed by pneumocystosis (30 %), ARDS (16 %), flu (6 %) and tuberculosis (2 %). Median time of NIV was 3,5 days. We had a NIV success rate of 60 % (14 patients were intubated, 5 did not have intubation indication and 1 patient died from another cause). The mortality rate was 28 %. We found statistically significant association between the severity scores SAPSII and APACHE and the NIV result and death (higher scores were associated with failure of NIV and death). We also found that patients with hematological neoplasia under chemotherapy had higher rates of failure of NIV and death. HIV infection was associated with death but not with NIV failure.",

We found that higher severity scores and hematological neoplasia under chemotherapy were associated with unsuccessful NIV. However NIV can be used in these patients as a comfort measure. In this prospective and observational study, we aimed to investigate the effect of fragility on the application and results of NIV in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We included in the patients over 50 years old who were admitted to Medical ICUs of our hospital. For detection of patients fragility Clinical Fragility Score (CFS) and comprehensive geriatric assesment were used. Patients who have CFS > =5 were considered as fragile. The successful NIV group (NSG) is defined as achieving success in at least two of the followings: PaO2 > 60 mmHg, PaCO2 < 50 mmHg, pH = 7,35-7,45, improvement of respiratory effort, recovery of consciousness. The relationship between entubation and fragility was also assessed. Application problems were defined as; cooperation problems, hearing problems, delirium/agitation (Richmond agitation sedation scale > 1) , claustrophobia, alzheimer, problems related with chin, mouth tooth and leak (>35 L/min). Results: We included in 85 patients who were underwent to NIV in two ICUs. Mean age of patients was 72,5 \u00b1 10,6, 60 % of them were male and mean APACHE II score was 20,6 \u00b1 5,7 (8-34).

This may reflect lower HFOV mean airway pressures in shock patients as well as having experienced personnel available 24 hours a day in our institution. We conclude there may still be a role for HFOV in severe ARDS if patients are properly selected and careful attention is paid to mean airway pressures. Introduction: Multiple studies have shown that low tidal volume, lung protective ventilation strategies may reduce pulmonary complications in non-ARDS ICU patients. In busy ICUs, discrepancies may arise between ventilator management goals and actual practice. We developed a goal-directed mechanical ventilation order set that included physician-specified lung-protective ventilation and oxygenation goals to be implemented by our respiratory therapists (RTs). Our primary outcomes were to determine if a simple respiratory therapist-driven order set with predefined goals regarding oxygenation and ventilation could be implemented with good compliance and to determine compliance with the ARDSNet PEEP/ FiO2 Introductions: Over 60 % of patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will require Endotracheal Tube (ETT) intubation and mechanical ventilation [1] . The aim was to perform an audit of ventilation regimes in critically ill patients admitted to Whiston Hospital. Its main objectives were to evaluate the current management of ventilated patients on ICU at Whiston hospital in comparison to the current local standards of best practice, with the main emphasis surrounding IBW (Ideal Body Weight) documentation and reduction in initial tidal volume (TV) from traditional guidelines. [2] . This study assesses the ability of the lung aeration scoring [3] using LUS to predict successful weaning in critically ill patients.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Lung aeration score using lung ultrasound can predict weaning failure in critically ill patients. Our study showed that a LUS score of >18 has a good prediction value. However larger randomised controlled trials are required to validate this pilot study. Introduction: Clinicians are routinely faced with the challenges of managing the ventilatory care and weaning process during the clinical course of the illness. Almost 40 % of mechanical ventilation time is spent on weaning [1] and in the last decade, automatic ventilator control and ventilation modes were designed to help weaning from mechanical ventilation. In many studies automated weaning significantly decreased weaning time in critically ill patients when compared with physician controlled weaning process [2, 3] . We conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing automated weaning with a standardized weaning protocol in a multidisciplinary ICU. Methods: From April 2014 to Mars 2015, we enrolled critically ill adults requiring more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomized since admission considering availability of SmartCare equipped ventilators (8 Evita XL in our unit: 4 with SmartCare and 4 without). We included patients who tolerated at least 24 hours of pressure support with PEP equal or less than 5 cmH2O and were not ready to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial, they were assigned to be weaned either by SmartCare (SC Group) or by the physician controlled weaning according to local guidelines (PCW Group). Weaning duration, total duration of mechanical ventilation and the success of weaning were the primary endpoints. Results: Forty-four patients were enrolled, 22 in each group. There was no difference between the two groups concerning age, sex, neurological or respiratory history, diagnosis or severity at study entry. Weaning duration and total mechanical ventilation were similar between the two groups and were respectively 6 +/-7 days in PCW Group vs 5 +/-4 days in SC Group (p = 0.63) and 11 [3-37] days vs 10 [3-23] days in SC Group. In the PCW Group, we noted only one extubation failure and there were no reintubation in SC Group. Conclusions: Although automated weaning using SmartCare did not show significant benefit for patients concerning duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of weaning when compared to physiciancontrolled weaning according to local protocols; it has certainly offer a gain of time for the medical staff in an ICU where there is no respiratory physiotherapist neither critical care specialty nurses. Introduction: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a therapy for vital support used in a significant proportion of critically ill patients. The right time to succesfully discontinue this therapy is a challenge for the intensivist The ecocardiographic evaluation of the diastolic dysfunction, the diaphragm and the lung have become an invaluable tool for weaning from MV protocols, especially in pacients with dificult or prolong weaning from MV. We propose a mathematichal model of an ultrasound protocol for weaning from MV that integrates the three modalities Methods: Based on current literature, we develop a score justified by a mathematical model based on inequations Results: When the risk of failure in the weaning process rises, for these reason the weaning process should be suspended. When the risk of failure is low and the weaning process should be continued.",

            "text": "Conclusions: The use of math models for decision making is of great importance, it sets an objective parameter within the existing evaluations. We proposed the use of inequations, to set intervals of solution with the three points of care for ultrasound guided weaning from MV. With this the inequations propose generate an area of certainty within the proposed values an the solution intervals. Introduction: Our aim was to assess diaphragm ultrasonography as a tool to predict the outcome of weaning. Methods: We enrolled 5 intubated patients who were admitted to our Intensive Care Unit at the Saint Antony Hospital of Padua; a Nutrivent nasogastric tube was placed in each to measure the diaphragm contractility as the transdiaphragmatic pressure (\u00c4Pdi) with the following formula: \u00c4Pdi = gastric pressure-esophageal pressure. We performed a diaphragmatic sonography with the M-mode technique. We calculated the diaphragm contraction speed as the slope (Scdi) of the curve provided by the diaphragm contraction during the inspiratory phase of the spontaneous breathing trials. The correlation between the mean \u00c4Pdi and the mean Scdi was evaluated using the Pearson's method according with a linear regression analysis. Results: We found a significant correlation between the \u00c4Pdi and the Scdi with a Pearson coefficient \u00f1 = -0.851 and a linear determination index R = 0.718 as shown in Fig. 60 . Conclusions: the Scdi calculated during trials of spontaneous breathing represented a bedside, standardized and reproducible tool to predict the outcome of weaning. Methods of titrating PEEP to safely recruit the lungs have included achieving adequate SpO2, attaining best compliance, or increasing PEEP while monitoring esophageal manometry to establish a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Bedside ultrasonography is available and useful as a diagnostic tool in the care of critically ill patients. Preliminary work identified marked differences in excursions between the dorsal and ventral diaphragms during lung-protective tidal ventilation in ARDS patients. We hypothesize that lung recruitment in the supine patient may be detected non-invasively by increased dorsal diaphragmatic excursions, indicating that dependent lung regions may be recruiting with adequate PEEP. Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we enrolled 7 ARDS patients treated with invasive mechanical ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in the supine position. We measured Ptp using esophageal manometry and ventral/dorsal diaphragm excursions using anatomic M-mode ultrasonography as the applied PEEP was changed (set by the treating physician) as follows: +3,+6, -3, and -6 cmH2O. A standard lung history was established by recruitment maneuvers between each PEEP change, and the sequence of PEEP changes was randomized for each subject. We used linear mixed effects models to evaluate for an association between applied PEEP and Ptp and dorsal diaphragmatic excursion (DDE). Results: Acceptable ultrasound images of diaphragm excursion were obtained in 6 of 7 patients; one patient had a large hepatic cyst precluding diaphragm ultrasound, data from this subject was excluded from the analysis. At enrollment, the mean(+/-SD) P/F ratio was 156 +/-61 mmHg, mean baseline PEEP was 12.7+/-2.2 cmH2O, and the mean SpO2 was 94+/-2.2 %. Ventral diaphragmatic excursions were unchanged by PEEP. Increasing PEEP resulted in corresponding increases in Ptp and DDE (p = .0006, p = .005). The transition from a negative to positive Ptp with increasing PEEP occurred as DDE was observed to markedly increase. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests an association between Ptp and DDE as dorsal lung is recruited by increasing PEEP. If validated in a larger sample, ultrasound evaluation of dorsal diaphragmatic movement may be a non-invasive method for estimating lung recruitment in ARDS. Introduction: Pulse oximetry (SpO2) is intensively used as a surrogate for arterial oxygenation (SaO2) however, little is known about its accuracy in daily ICU practice. Disturbed perfusion may lead to a poor signal as indicated by a lower perfusion index value (PFI) and so compromise its accuracy. We studied SpO2 accuracy in its relationship to the PFI. Methods: In a 5 month period, 281 patients were retrospectively studied resulting in 1281 concomitantly measured values of SpO2 (Philips M1191BL/M1194A), SaO2 and PFI. Inotropic use, pH, MAP, mechanical ventilation and body temperature were studied as independent variables. PFI values were categorized as low or poor with PFI < 1.0, intermediate or moderate with 1.0 < PFI < 2.5 and as reliable or high with PFI > 2.5. Data collection: All SaO2, SpO2 and PFI measurements during the first 3 days after admittance were collected unless the patient was invasively ventilated, then all measurements were collected until extubation. Statistical analysis: A linear correlation of the SpO2 and SaO2 values was assessed by Pearson's method and the mean SpO2-SaO2 difference (\u0394 ) was assessed by using the Bland and Altman method. Results: Statistical analysis showed an overall correlation (r = 0.685; p < 0.01) between SaO2 and SpO2. The Bland and Altman analysis revealed that the limit of agreement within the general mean and \u00b12SD showed a \u0394 of \u00b16 % (Fig. 61) . Of all values SpO2 overestimated the SaO2 value in 48.2 % of all cases and underestimated SaO2 in 31.4 %. Over a wide range of PFI values (median 1.4, range 0.1-19.2) we found moderate agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 with slightly better agreement for higher PFI values (Fig. 62 ). Even with a PFI > 2.5, 15.9 % of all measurements showed a difference between SpO2 and SaO2 of more than \u00b12 %. The other independent variables showed only very weak associations (r < 0.2) with the \u0394 SpO2-SaO2, except for mechanical ventilation (ANOVA p = 0.002). Conclusions: We found a clinical relevant lack of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements. In contrast to general expectations SpO2 exceeds SaO2 in 48.2 % of all measurements. PFI is of little value as differences may be great as even with a high (good) PFI value, 15.9 % of concurrent measurements of SpO2 and SaO2 differ > \u00b12 %. These findings may influence daily practice on how to adjust mechanical ventilation by SpO2 measurements. (Fig. 63a) . Correlation was poor between the capnograph's RR & EtCO2 measurements: normal EtCO2 coincided with adequate RR just 24.9 % of the time & none of the low RR measurements were revealing of a high EtCO2 (Fig. 63b ). When using RR as a proxy for MV it was also noted that low MV is observed at a wide range of RRs, with only 15.5 % of all low MV events captured by a low EtCO2-based RR (Fig. 63c) .",

Introduction: Capnography (EtCO2) is unreliable for monitoring respiratory status in non-intubated patients. We used a noninvasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM), which provides accurate measurements of minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume & respiratory rate (RR) in non-intubated patients, to compare the relationship between EtCO2 & MV in intubated patients with general anesthesia (GA), non-intubated patients with spinal anesthesia (SA) & awake volunteers. Methods: RVM data (ExSpiron, Respiratory Motion Inc., Waltham MA) were collected from 153 patients in 3 groups: Group 1, 54 patients, age:65.2 \u00b1 12.1 yrs, BMI:31.2 \u00b1 6.3 kg/m2, surgery with GA; Group 2, 60 patients, 68.9 \u00b1 9.0 yrs, 30.5 \u00b1 5.8 kg/m2, surgery with SA; Group 3, 39 volunteers, 48.5 \u00b1 13.8 yrs, 27.9 \u00b1 8.6 kg/m2, coached to breathe at varied RRs. Groups 1&2 EtCO2 data were collected via ventilator (Draeger Apollo), with an ET tube in Group 1 & sampling nasal cannula in Group 2. Group 3 EtCO2 data were collected via capnograph (Capnostream20, Covidien) with nasal cannula. Deming regression quantified the relationship between EtCO2&MV. EtCO2 sensitivity&mean EtCO2 were compared across cohorts by unpaired t-tests. Results: The EtCO2 sensitivity was significantly higher in intubated patients vs volunteers (-83.5\u00b0\u00b1 9.7\u00b0vs-30.1\u00b0\u00b1 16.1\u00b0, p < 0.001, Fig. 64a ). In non-intubated patients the sensitivity was not normally distributed & spanned the range of intubated patients & volunteers. Measured EtCO2 values were higher in Group1 than Groups 2&3 (37.2 \u00b1 4.4 mmHg vs 23.0 \u00b1 5.2 mmHg vs 31.0 \u00b1 4.0 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.001, Fig. 64b ). EtCO2 measurements were normally distributed in all groups. Conclusions: Our results show that EtCO2 lacks adequate sensitivity to changes in MV&introduces measurement bias with the nasal cannula.",

Their performance is not better than the performance of RSBI [3] . We previously investigated in a physiological study the relationship between Edi peak and Edi area under the curve (P/I Index); we concluded that P/I Index can give important information on the balance between respiratory drive and respiratory demand, and may predict weanability at clinical support level [4] .

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 54 patients ventilated with NAVA meeting criteria for SBT. For each patient, we identified 2 step: 1) enrollment, T[sub]0[/sub]; 2) end of SBT. We recorded RSBI, Edi peak, and two Edi-derived weaning indices: NVE , P/I Index. SBT failure and success were defined according to clinical protocol in use.

Conclusions: P/I Index predict ability to sustain SBT under ventilator assistance and during SBT. Subgroup A may represent a group of patients not adequately assisted, where classic indices and NVE are not able to predict the inability to start SBT. Further investigations are needed to understand whether P/I Index may provide information on adequacy of assistance during NAVA ventilation. Introduction: Opioid use decreases respiratory drive and can cause opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), which is challenging to recognize in non-intubated patients from respiratory rate (RR) alone. Using a non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM) that measures minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and RR, we examined whether RR alone can identify LowMV episodes (used to define OIRD) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods: After written informed consent, MV, TV and RR measurements were collected via RVM (ExSpiron, Respiratory Motion, Waltham MA) from 358 patients (age: 67.1, 19-91 yrs; BMI: 29.8,19-49 kg/m2) undergoing elective joint replacement surgery. 205 patients received PCA opioids in the PACU: 96 received hydromorphone (0.2 mg) and 109 received morphine (1 mg per dose). RVM measurements were calculated from 30-second segments in the 30 minutes before and after first dose. Predicted MV (MVPRED) was calculated from each patient's BSA. LowMV was defined as MV < 40%MVPRED for >1 min. LowRR was defined as RR < 6breaths/min. Sensitivity and specificity analysis correlated LowRR with LowMV. Results: For patients receiving opioids, LowMV occurred 13.7 % of the time before and 17.8 % of the time after a dose. Importantly, LowRR coincided with less than 12.5 % of all LowMV episodes. On average, patients experienced 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 LowMV episodes before opioid (range: 0-9episodes; duration: 2.17 \u00b1 0.13 min) and 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 LowMV episodes (0-9episodes; 2.40 \u00b1 0.12 min) after opioid dosage (p > 0.5). In both groups, a low RR alarm set to below 6 breaths/min would miss 88.3 % of LowMV episodes, yielding a sensitivity of 12.4 %, specificity 98.5 %, positive predictive value 60.5 %, and negative predictive value 85.8 %. Figure 67 shows a plot of paired MV and RR measurements. Conclusions: LowRR measurements alone provide an insufficient assessment of respiratory status. Our data suggest that LowMV is primarily related to a decrease in TV and not RR. Introduction: Although regional compliance (C) and resistance (R) can vary considerably between different lung regions, traditional pulmonary function tests can measure global values, only. To overcome this drawback we recently proposed a novel EIT-based method to estimate regional expiratory time constants (\u03c4 = tau). In this abstract regional values were compared with global ones. Methods: In ten intubated patients with hypoxemic and hypercapnia lung failure time constants (\u03c4 = R\u00b7C) were estimated from global and regional volume EIT signals obtained by Swisstom BB 2 (Swisstom, Switzerland). A first order exponential decay model was fitted to each regional and global impedance curve using MATLAB (The MathWorks, USA). The spread and mean of regional \u03c4 values is depicted in Fig. 68 and compared with the one \u03c4 value derived from the global signal. Results: ARDS lungs exhaled \"faster\" whereas COPD lungs were \"slower\", the latter reflecting the predominance of airway obstruction. ARDS patients show only minor regional differences and global \u03c4 corresponded perfectly with the mean \u03c4 derived from different lung regionals. In contrast, COPD patients showed a large spread of their regional \u03c4 values. Nonetheless, the mean of the regional \u03c4 values corresponded well with global \u03c4 . Conclusions: Mean expiratory time constant derived from regional EIT signals was similar to the one value calculated from the global EIT signal in both, patients with short (ARDS) and long expiration time requirements (COPD). As a sign of heterogeneous disease, the latter showed a wide spread of regional \u03c4 values. Introduction: Passive exhalation shows a characteristic exponential course with asymptotic approximation of the end expiratory lung volume. It can be described as V(t) = Vinsp \u00b7 e^(-t/(R \u00b7 C)) where V is the lung volume at time t, Vinsp the volume at end inspiration, R the resistance and C the compliance of the lungs. The product of R \u00b7 C is called \u03c4 (tau). Although R and C can vary considerably between different lung regions, traditional pulmonary function tests provide global values, only. Therefore, we recently proposed a novel method to obtain regional \u03c4 values using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). As this approach can be challenging in presence of small ventilation amplitudes, noisy signals and heterogeneity we determined in this study its robustness. Methods: In 8 intubated patients, with hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure, we measured EIT signals at 50 images per second using Swisstom BB 2 recording 30 consecutive breaths during steady state conditions. Regional breath by breath \u03c4 values (Fig. 69) were estimated by fitting an exponential model to each regional curve. Only \u03c4 values within the range of 0.05 and 3 s stemming from appropriately fitted curves (R 2 > 0.6) were considered thereby excluding poorly ventilated and poorly fitted lung areas. To estimate the robustness of \u03c4 , we calculated the regional coefficient of variation (CV) for all breaths as standard deviation divided by mean. Results: Mean and median CV values of each patient were below 5 %, however some pixels showed values of up to 25 % mainly at the lung boundaries or close to poorly ventilated areas. Conclusions: The suggested approach for calculating regional expiratory \u03c4 values provided robust results with low coefficients of variation. However, certain lung regions at the lungs' boundary showed high variability. Therefore, to increase reliability such pixels should be excluded from future calculations. Introduction: Obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or COPD are increasing in numbers and frequently lead to severe exacerbations with the need of non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Severe COPD in particular is often characterized by inhomogeneous ventilation. In case of mechanical ventilation in obstructive pulmonary diseases or ARDS, modern ICU ventilators provide accurate measurements of pressure-volume curves on a global, but not on a regional level. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in contrast is an established non-invasive tool to measure regional ventilation. The aim of our study was to calculate an EIT-based (32x32 pixel, 50 frames per second) expiratory time constant \u03c4 (tau) for each image pixel and a global one for the entire lung and to validate it against a global volume signal measured at the airway opening. Methods: In 12 intubated patients with hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure we performed EIT and pneumatic volume measurements (Swisstom BB2, Switzerland) on different PEEP level recording 100 consecutive breaths during steady state conditions with breathing frequencies between 14 and 16/min. Regional breath by breath \u03c4 values were obtained by fitting in a nonlinear least square manner an exponential function to the EIT curve of each pixel. The same algorithm was applied to the pneumatic volume curve and correlated with the mean \u03c4 of all regional EIT measurements. Results: The mean \u03c4 calculated from the regional EIT signals showed a strong correlation with the global \u03c4 calculated from the pneumatic volume signal. In 2773 breaths Pearson r was 0.8752 (0.8662 to 0.8836) and r2 0.7660. Patients with severe COPD typically showed longer time constants than those with ARDS. The mean \u03c4 calculated from the global EIT signals showed a strong correlation with the global \u03c4 calculated from the pneumatic volume signal as well (Pearson r: 0.8978). Conclusions: The mean \u03c4 calculated from the regional EIT signals shows a very strong correlation with the global pneumatic volume signal reflecting EIT as a valid method to calculate global and regional expiratory time constants. EIT therefore provides for the first time a regional breath by breath measurement of airflow obstruction and may help to guide mechanical ventilation especially in obstructive pulmonary diseases. Introduction: We have shown in pigs and ARDS patients that lung elastance can be determined without esophageal pressure as the change in PEEP divided by the change in end-expiratory lung volume, deltaPEEP/deltaEELV [1, 2] . The hypothesis is that this is an effect of contra-directional forces of the expanding rib cage and recoil of the lung that creates negative pleural pressure, which persists also at an increased PEEP/EELV. Esophageal pressure, used as a surrogate for pleural pressure (PPL) is unreliable for determining absolute endexpiratory esophageal pressure, because of extra-pleural effects on measurements. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an expanding rib cage on absolute pleural pressure changes during PEEP steps in a respiratory system model. Methods: A model with a recoiling elastic lung and expansive chest wall complex was built (Fig. 70) . Lung elastance could be varied between 46, 24, and 17 cmH2O/L. In volume control, PEEP was increased from 0 to 4, 8, and 12 cmH2O, while airway and pleural pressure was measured and deltaEELV obtained by spirometry. Results: When PEEP was increased endexpiratory pleural pressure increased during the first expiration, but then declined back to baseline, while end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (PTPEE) increased until it equaled the change in end-expiratory airway pressure (delta-PEEP = deltaPTPEE) (Fig. 71) . There was an good correlation between transpulmonary pressure at all lung volume levels derived from PAW-PPL (pleural pressure) and transpulmonary pressure derived from lung elastance calculated as deltaPEEP/deltaEELV, r2 = 0.99, y = 1.01x. Conclusions: As end-expiratory pleural pressure remains unchanged when increasing PEEP, end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure changes as much as PEEP and lung compliance can be determined as deltaEELV/deltaPEEP. (transudate or exudate).The presence of pleural or abdominal effusion is a frequent finding in patients in the ICU and Internal Medicine Department.It is possible to distinguish between transudate and exudate by Light's criteria [1, 2] .Pursuing an acid-base assessment of the fluid,we have noticed an increase in the value of lactate,beyond the blood range,in the cases that were diagnosed like exudate to the calculation of Light criteria [4] .The advantages of this test is that it is a simple test,executable by the physician and his result is available within few minutes. Methods: We collected data of 30 patients who had clinical indication for thoracentesis or paracentesis.For each patient we performed arterial blood gas with lactate,total protein and serum LDH dosage,acid-base assessment with lactate,total protein and LDH dosage,cytology and bacterial culture on the fluid.Of every patient we calculated \"liquid/serum\" lactate ratio in order to measure the eventually present increase in pleural or abdominal effusion.The diagnosis of the liquid effusion nature (exudate or transudate) was performed by Light's criteria.A statistical analysis was carried out by performing a ROC curve in order to find the best cut-off for liquid/ serum lactate ratio predicting the presence of an exudate. We performed a ROC curve to predict the presence of exudate by the liquid serum lactate ratio and we obtained an AuROC of 0.69 with the best cut-off value of 2,02 (Sensitivity 0,73 and Specificity 0,73). When we performed the same analysis only on pleural effusion patients we obtanined a an AuROC of 0,78 with the best cut-off value of 2,13 (Sensitivity 0,7, Specificity 1,0). Conclusions: Liquid/Serum lactate ratio seems to be a promising tool to predict the presence of an exudate,in particular in pleural effusions. Further studies are needed to warrant these statements. Results: 8048 records were reviewed and 79 met the inclusion criteria. A control group of patients without a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis was used for comparison (7954). Results showed 54 % of patients with pulmonary fibrosis died before discharge from the unit compared to 18.8 % in the control group p = 0.0001 (Table 34) . Similarly, 63.3 % of patients with pulmonary fibrosis died before hospital discharge compared to 26.3 % of the control group p = 0.0001 (Table 35) . Conclusions: The results from this study are consistent with previous findings. The risk of death prior to discharge from our intensive care unit is almost 30 % higher for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. From the data presented above, it may be prudent to consider that patients with pulmonary fibrosis presenting with no reversible causes of acute respiratory failure may be less likely to benefit from admission to the ICU. Introduction: For patients with ARDS supported on ECMO, the optimal sedation and analgesia strategy is unknown. Our objective was to characterize pharmacological practice in a high-volume ECMO center and describe sedation depth, incidence of delirium and mobilization in this population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to describe medication (sedative, analgesic, paralytic, antipsychotic) administration in 60 patients treated with VV-ECMO for ARDS at Toronto General Hospital. We recorded Sedation-Agitation Scale scores (SAS), medications administered, routes and doses, CAM-ICU scores, and mobilization while on ECMO. Results: (INTERIM) 23 adults (19 males, 48 \u00b1 11 years, APACHE II 31 \u00b1 5) with severe ARDS (P/F 72 \u00b1 19), mainly from pulmonary sepsis (91 %), were treated with VV-ECMO from Jan 2012-July 2014. Median duration of VV-ECMO was 9 days (IQR 5-11). At 48 hr post ECMO initiation all patients were deeply sedated (SAS[<=]3), with 96 % and 100 % receiving a sedative (midazolam 87 %, propofol 26 %) and opioid (fentanyl 91 %) infusion respectively. Within 24 hr prior to ECMO discontinuation, in patients who survived ECMO (78 %), 44 % of patients were still deeply sedated. At this time, 89 % were receiving sedatives (67 % infusion vs 22 % intermittent) and 83 % were receiving opioids (72 % infusion vs 11 % intermittent). At 48 hr post ECMO discontinuation 83 % of patients reached light levels of sedation (SAS > 3). At this time point only 61 % were still receiving sedatives (33 % infusion vs 29 % intermittent) and 50 % were receiving opioids (33 % infusion vs 17 % intermittent); 22 % were not receiving any sedative or opioid. While on ECMO 57 % of patients had cisatracurium infusions for a median duration of 16 hrs (IQR 10-76). 88 % had [>=]1 positive CAM-ICU score for delirium. Haloperidol and quetiapine were the primary antipsychotics used throughout ECMO (30 % and 57 % respectively). 57 % of patients underwent physical were accepted into the service. The remaining 50 (11 %) were transferred to another national centre due to the lack of ECMO beds at the studied centre. The mean age and duration of mechanical ventilation before referral were significantly higher in the futile group (56.1 years, 5.1 days) compared to those who were accepted (42.9 years, 3.1 days) or \u00a1\u00aetoo well\u00a1\u00af(46.5 years, 3.3 days) (p <0.05). The futile group had higher rates of multi-organ failure and severe immunosuppression. Gender, body mass index, lung injury scores and degree of hypoxaemia were similar in all 3 groups. Interestingly, 60 % of patients who were too well had higher lung injury scores (Murray score \u00a1\u00dd3) compared to 45 % and 41 % in those who were futile and accepted respectively. The survival of the \u00a1\u00aefutile\u00a1\u00afgroup was poor; whilst those who were too well and accepted had similar outcomes. At 180 days, 44 % of those who were too well had died, whilst 15 % of those who were futile survived.",

Introduction: Acute Lung Injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is characterized by tight junction's (TJ's) barrier disruption and changes in the composition and integrity of Claudins (CLDN) which are components of TJ's. CLDN5 is highly expressed and augment permeability in lung parenchyma, although the regulation by inflammatory stimuli remains elusive. This study aims to investigate CLDN5 expression and regulation by TNF, in LPS-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. Methods: Lung injury was induced by intratracheal LPS administration in adult male C57BL/6, and TNF-/-mice. Mice underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sacrificed at 6 h and 24 h after LPS administration. Histological score of ALI was assessed in lung tissues. CLDN5 cellular localization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, while its expression levels were verified by Western blotting. Results: In mice lung tissue, following LPS administration, CLDN5 immunoreactivity was distributed along the alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium. CLDN5 protein expression levels was increased by 3 fold along with ALI characteristics (augmented in BALF cellularity, protein content and ALI score). In TNF-/-mice, CLDN5 expression is statistically reduced as early as 6 h after LPS administration with consequently increased in BALF protein content. In addition increased CLDN5 expression was observed upon 24 h LPS administration. TNF biphasic action on CLDN5 expression was dependent on ERK1/2 expression levels. Conclusions: In LPS induced ALI/ARDS in mice, CLDN5 was increased associated with ALI severity. Moreover, TNF regulates CLDN5 expression, and TJs permeability dependent in part on ERK1/2 pathway. Our findings emerge the role of Claudins and especially CLDN5 to elucidate the pathophysiology of this form of injury.",

Our intensive care unit (ICU) bowel care guideline specifies initiation of treatment for constipation, defined as a patient not opening their bowels for three consecutive days. Methods: We retrospectively audited consecutive ICU patients over a two-months to establish the incidence of constipation as well as adherence to bowel care guideline. Patients were excluded if they had stayed on the ICU for less than three days, had undergone recent bowel surgery or were on an alternative bowel care protocol (e.g. encephalopathy, spinal or brain injury patients). Data collected included bowel care prescriptions, rectal examinations, episodes of bowel opening and stool type. Results: Of the 37 patients included, 43 % suffered a period of constipation during their ICU stay. Treatment for patients who had not had their bowels opened for three consecutive days was initiated in only 44 % of patients. Treatment strategies for constipation varied and were partially or fully compliant with guidelines in only 37.5 % of constipated patients.

Introduction: ICU is a local where there is a great concern with costbenefit ratio. Introduction: Although described more than 70 years ago, the refeeding syndrome remains understudied with lack of a standardized definition and treatment recommendations.

Intermediate care units provide more monitoring than general wards and less than ICU with evidence to support the benefits on cost and patient outcomes [2] .

The clinical picture consisted of vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive generalized muscle weakness requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, with subsequent ICU admission. Severe hypokalemia was documented (minimum K+ 1.2 mmol/L), complicated by frequent ventricular premature beats with prolonged QT interval (corrected value was 640 ms). Magnesium sulfate and a K+ infusion were administered, but serum K+ remained low. Serum K+ was then 2.2 mmol/L and barium levels were 0.04 mmol/L (toxic range). Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was started. This resulted in a rapid decrease in barium levels and normalization of serum K+. Clinical improvement ensued with the correction of hypokalemia and restored muscular function, allowing spontaneous ventilation and extubation 6 hours later. Barium was persistently undetectable from 12 hours after the beginning of CVVHDF (<0.006 mmol/L). The patient was later transferred to the Psychiatry department, with an uneventful hospital stay.",

Our data suggest that the percentages of ventilated patients developed VAP is independent from the use of main sedative and neuromuscular blockage agents in all ICU ventilated patients.",

Wacharasint Introduction: Obesity is one of the major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. While obesity itself is a chronic inflammatory condition, previous studies showed that the obese patient with severe infection was found associated with significantly lower mortality compared to the septic patients with normal BMI [1] . In surgical critically ill patients whether obesity confers a \"protective\" effect is not clearly defined. We hypothesized that surgical critically ill patients, which their disease pathologies differ from septic medical patients, may also have \"protective\" effect from obesity. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the THAI-SICU study databases, which recruited 4652 Thai patients who admitted to the surgical intensive care units of nine university-based hospitals in Thailand [2] . All 4579 patients whose body mass index (BMI) and mortality at 28 days were available, were included in this analysis. The patients were categorized into 4 groups based on their BMI i.e., underweight (BMI <18.5), normal BMI (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obesity (BMI >30). Primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcome was the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS Introduction: Our objective was to identify factors associated with high mortality on admission to a mixed ICU in a resource-constrained environment, and to examine the impact of high-risk admissions.

Logistic regression was used to describe predicted hospital mortality using age, Apache II score, referring specialty and preadmission CPR. The subset admitted post-CPR were further analysed. These models were then fit-tested using ROC curves. Cost of ICU stay was estimated using mean duration of stay and our current mean ICU cost. ) and daily meetings between oncologists and ICU team (OR = 0.69 (0.52-0.91)) were associated with lower mortality. Conversely, mortality was higher in ICU holding training programs in critical care (OR = 1.38 (1.05-1.81)). The number of protocols (OR = 1.52 (1.11-2.07)) and meetings between oncologists and ICU team (OR = 4.70 (1.15-19.22)) were also independently associated with a more efficient resource use (both low SMR and SRU). Admission to ICUs in cancer centers compared to general hospitals and annual casevolume had no impact on mortality or resource use.

It was an observational study which was assessed retrospectively, the data of all adults patients admitted in ICU (excluding terminals).

Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) are used to predict prognosis in critical patients based in clinical and analytic criteria obtained in the first 24 hours after admission. Through this study we aim to analyse which factors predict mortality in a cohort of febrile neutropenic (FN) patients with haematological malignancies. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study which evaluated all hemato-oncological patients with FN admitted to an ICU in a comprehensive cancer center between January, 2011 and December, 2014. Baseline clinical and demographic information was described using descriptive statistics. Factors predicting in-ICU mortality were identified using univariate logistic regression. Variables with a p value <0.20 were included in a multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 54 patients were included for analysis. The median age at admission was 48 years and 51.9 % were male (N = 28). The baseline cause of immunosuppression was Alogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (N = 20) and recent Chemotherapy (N = 34). The SAPS II and APACHE II scores had a median of 64 and 28.5, respectively. Multiple organ dysfunction was observed in 79.63 % of cases (N = 43). The single more frequent dysfunctions were respiratory, in 94.44 % (N = 51), renal, in 62.96 % (N = 34), and cardiovascular dysfunction, in 57.40 % of patients (N = 31). Renal replacement therapy was required in 11 cases. Invasive ventilation was performed in 81.48 % of patients (N = 44), with median duration of 168 hours. The median ICU length of stay was 8 days. In-ICU mortality was 31.48 % (N = 17). In univariate analysis, the APACHE II (OR 1.279, p value <0.01), SAPS II (OR 1.082, p value <0.01), renal dysfunction (OR 3.403, p value <0.05) and invasive ventilation (IV) (OR 8.7, p value <0.20) were associated with in-ICU mortality. In a multivariate analysis, APACHE II remained statistically significant (OR 1.546, p value 0.018, AUC 0.84) as IV in an exact logistic analysis. Conclusions: A high APACHE II score and IV seems to predict an elevated mortality risk in ICU patients with FN and haematological malignancies. SAPS II appears to be a less important predictor of mortality in this setting. However, it should be noted that the scores shouldn't be used to ascertain prognosis in individual cases.",

            "text": "(1) The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and nature of patient-reported alopecia in a cohort of critical illness survivors. Methods: This was a single centre, qualitative survey study completed in the ICU Follow-up Clinic of a teaching hospital in Wales. All patients who had been discharged home for at least 12 weeks, following an ICU stay of three or more days and attending the Follow-Up Clinic, were invited to complete the survey. The survey was adapted from one used in a previous study and included questions regarding patient demographics and alopecia.(2) Statistical analysis included numbers (%) and medians (IQR). Comparisons between patients with and without alopecia were made using Fisher's Exact test and Mann Whitney U test. Due to the anonymity of the surveys the Wales REC 6 confirmed ethical approval was not needed for this study. Results: The survey was completed by 75 patients attending the clinic between July and December 2014. Median age was 65 years and 35 % of patients were male. Alopecia was reported in 13 (17 %) patients and the hair loss was gradual in 12 (92 %) of the 13 patients. The severity of hair loss in this cohort ranged between less than 10 % to over 50 %, with the location of hair loss varying between the patients. In all but one of the patients hair loss occurred gradually at between one and six weeks post-ICU discharge and lasted for between one and seven months. On analysis, no significant differences were found between the patients with and without alopecia in the demographic variables. Conclusions: Limited research exists examining the incidence and nature of patient-reported alopecia in adult survivors of critical illness. The type, amount and location of the hair loss varied between patients in this study. The main limitation of this study is the survey design resulting in a lack of information regarding potential predictors of alopecia. The incidence reported in this study however suggests that further research is warranted. Introduction: South Wales is an area of relative socio-economic deprivation, with a myriad of well-recognised associated mental health problems. Patients with mental health disorders are commonly admitted to an ICU as a direct consequence of their illness, such as a suicide attempt, or due to indirect consequences, such as an intravenous drug overdose in drug addicts. As a result of these findings we set out to ascertain the effect of pre-existing mental health issues including addiction on ICU admission. Methods: A prospective study design was used in which data was collected on all admissions to the general ICU of a large teaching hospital in South Wales, over a two month period. All adult patients were screened for the following questions; Was the admission a direct consequence of a mental health disorder or recreational/ illicit psychoactive substance use? Is there a co-existing mental health diagnosis present prior to admission? ICD-10 codes were used to define mental health disorders. Outcomes studied included in-hospital mortality, ventilator days and length of ICU stay. Data analysis included Fisher Exact and Mann Whitney U tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Ethical approval was waived for this service evaluation.",

The patients with a mental health disorder were significantly younger than the controls (p < 0.05) however there was no difference in APACHE II scores. There were no significant differences in mortality, mechanical ventilation days or ICU length of stay between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the mortality rate between the patients admitted as a direct consequence of a mental health disorder and the control group (p < 0.05) Conclusions: Patients with mental health problems appear to have worse outcomes than those without. The mortality of those admitted to ICU as a direct consequence of their mental health problems is significantly higher than controls. The reasons for this are unclear and likely multi-factorial. A future multi-centre prospective study is planned in Wales to investigate the national impact of mental health disorders on ICU resources.",

Data was extracted from our ICU patient database for a one year period from Sept 2014 to Aug 2015. There were 470 admissions during this period, of which 53 patients were octagenarians making it 11.3 % of the total admissions. The demographics and outcomes of octagenarians were compared with the rest of the ICU admissions with full available APACHE 4 during this period. Results: The average age of octagenarians admitted to our ICU was 84 years. Unlike the rest of the admissions, there were more females (55 %) amongst the octagenarians. Their average APACHE 4 score was 57.6 with a predicted mortality of 13.9 %. This correlated well with the actual mortality of 11.3 %. There was no statistically significant difference between the length of ICU stay or mortality between the octagenarians and the rest of the admissions. The number of cardiac patients between the two groups was also comparable. Conclusions: 11.3 % of all our ICU admissions were octagenarians. Compared to the western population, octagenarians admitted to our ICU seem to have a lower predicted and actual mortality indicating less illness severeity. This could be due to a combination of patient factors, healthcare factors, healthcare delivery location and cultural factors. Published western data may not be helpful for discussing the outcomes with the patient and the family or decision making, before or after ICU admission.",

ICU mortality among octagenerians was 28 % and was significantly higher compared to the younger patients (19 % mortality; p <0.0005). None of the patients aged 80 or more diagnosed with sepsis survived ICU. In-hospital mortality of octagenerians was 43 %. 10 patients (4 %) were readmitted to ICU, none of whom survived. Pre-admission performance status was not predictive considering ICU or hospital mortality. Conclusions: Octagenerians have higher ICU mortality rates compared to younger patients and their in-hospital mortality doubles. Readmission to ICU in analyzed period was associated with 100 % mortality. Pre ICU performance status was independent risk factor for mortality. Careful evaluation is warranted before readmitting elderly patient to MICU. We encourage making clear therapeutic plan after ICU discharge with clear recommendations considering potential ICU readmission, re-introducing invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressor or commencing renal replacement therapy and antibiotic treatment. Introduction: Many elderly patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) despite known poor outcomes and frequent patient preference to avoid unnecessary prolongation of life. The REALISTIC-80 (Realities, Expectations and Attitudes to LIfe Support Technologies in Intensive Care for Octogenarians) trial studied the outcomes of very elderly patients admitted to ICUs in Canada. Not only was mortality high, but long-term physical and functional recovery was also poor, raising questions about the appropriateness of ICU admission in this group. These findings also carry significant economic implications. Using data from REALISTIC-80 trial, we examined the cost of ICU admission for the very elderly, factors affecting this cost, and the potential savings of reducing admissions that are either undesired by the patient or medically futile.",

Overall cost of care per patient was determined by length of stay and direct-variable costs for ICU admission. Using both univariate and logistic regression models, we investigated potentially predictive factors influencing cost, including patient outcome (death vs. survival), frailty, residence in a nursing home, as well as the presence of advance directives. An exploratory analysis was performed to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing the number of ICU admissions in this population. Results: In total, 3,064 patients > =80 years old were admitted to ICU, of which 1,917 were eligible, and 610 were enrolled in the study. The average age was 84 years; median length of stay was 5 days in ICU and 21 days in hospital. Mortality was 14% in ICU, 26% in hospital and 41% at 12 months. For non-survivors, the median time from admission to death was 12 days. Of enrolled patients, 240 (39%) remained in ICU for 7 days or more; 99 (41%) of these died in hospital. At 1 year, 28% of patients had meaningful recovery measured by the Short Form-36, a survey of general health status that includes both physical and mental health component scales. The results of the cost analysis are pending and will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: In this study, we will demonstrate the significant economic costs of critical care in very elderly patients admitted to ICU-a population for whom this level of care is often unwanted or futile. More importantly, we expect to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing these admissions, which will be crucial for informing clinical and policymaking decisions.",

Results: 78 patients were included with a median age of 87 (range 85-96). 22 patients (28%) died during their ICU stay, and a further 12 (15%) died on the ward before discharge, giving a total of 34 (44%) hospital deaths. 6-and 24-month mortality were 54% and 60% respectively. Medical patients had the highest acuity scores and highest mortality at all end-points (Fig. 102) . High APACHE III scores (Fig. 103 ) and increasing numbers of organs supported correlated with shorter time from ICU admission to death (p < 0.0001 in both cases). Of those who required support of 4-5 organs (8 patients), none survived their hospital admission. Conclusions: Almost half of patients aged over 85 admitted to ICU died before discharge from hospital, but a large proportion of patients who survived 6 months were still alive at two years. High APA-CHE III scores and organ support were associated with higher mortality. These results suggest that intensive care is of benefit to selected patients aged over 85, and that acuity of illness is a useful indicator of long-term survival. Introduction: Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a frequent complication of critically ill patients with an approximately incidence of 25%-50%. The diagnosis is clinical and consists in assessing the strength of various muscles groups in the upper and lower extremities. This problem represents one of the greatest burdens patients face after surviving ICU care.

Predictive factors of ICU-AW were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: From the 177 patients included, 20,3% developed ICU-AW. The mean age was 57,3 years and 58,3% were female. The median time of mechanical ventilation was 343,5 hours. 55,6% of patients had solid tumors and 44,4% had hematological malignancies. Glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blocking agents were administered in 88,9% and 38,9% of patients, respectively. Septic shock developed in 72,2% of patients and was found to be a predictive factor for developing ICU-AW (OR 4,15, pvalue 0,018). 66,7% of patients started or continued physical rehabilitation during the hospital length of stay approximately 12 days after admission in the ICU. 44,4% of patients with ICU-AW died 37 days after admission in the ICU. 8 patients (22,2%) with ICU-AW were re-evaluated by physical and rehabilitation medicine 144 days after hospital discharge. Significant improvement was noted in their physical status while in the program of physical therapy. Conclusions: ICU-AW is a relatively frequent problem and septic shock was found to be a predictive factor for the development of this entity.

Subsequent patients for this project (total n = 47) have all therefore been tested using the 6MWT. Good inter-rater and intrarater reliability and validity have been reported for the 6MWT (3). Conclusions: Exercise capacity measurement is not achievable for some patients with either the ISWT or the CST due to the severity of their physical debilitation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are common psychological problems post discharge (4), therefore using a test with a bleep is not appropriate.

We used the ADEPT (aim, data, evidence, process, team) format. Our initial aim was 20 minutes of active mobilisation daily in 95% of suitable ICU patients. Patients had to be able to obey commands, to have achieved a degree of cardiovascular stability and must have no musculoskeletal injuries precluding mobilisation. Vasopressor use and invasive ventilation per se were not barriers to active mobilisation. Agreed forms of active mobilisation were active limb exercises (a booklet of exercises was developed), bed edge sit (dangle), sitting out of bed in a chair, standing and walking.

Early mobilization may enhance functional recovery, reduce days in mechanical ventilation, shorten ICU and hospital length of stay, decrease the incidence of delirium and improve survival. A great part of ICU patients are on vasoactive drug therapy, but there are few data in literature about the safety of mobilization in this group. Therefore our study aimed to prove that early mobilization even of patients using low dose of vasoactive drugs is safe and feasible. Methods: Whe assigned patients who were using or not low dose of vasoactive drugs to receive 2 daily sessions of physiotherapy during their ICU length of stay and analyzed their tolerance. The exercises consisted in 3 levels of mobilization: level 1 were passive exercises, level 2 were active exercises and level 3 were orthostatic position and walking. Hearth rate, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation and MAP were evaluated in 3 moments: before the physiotherapy session, immediately after and 30 minutes after.",

Mean SAPS 3 score was 73.6 in vasoactive group and 62.7 in control group (p < 0.05). The types of vasoactive drugs were 53.5% norepinephrine, 45.1% nitroprusside and 1.4% nitroglycerine. We removed from bed and putted on the seating position 34.7% of patients in the vasoactive group and 57.3% in the other group. There weren't complications statistically significant. During the exercises there were changes on MAP, but with no major event associated, though increase in dose of vasoactive drug (p > 0.05). The only statistically significant difference between the two groups was increase in MAP in the vasoactive group immediately after mobilization (from mean MAP of 84.02 to 87.0). The mean dosage in mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine was 0.0117, nitroprusside 0.098 and nitroglycerin 0.278. Conclusions: Our study showed that mobilization of patients on low dose of vasoactive drugs therapy may be possible and safe, with little complications and no major changes in MAP. These data are very important to encourage early mobilization of patients in ICU and to ameliorate their outcomes. Introduction: During an intensive care stay, patients often have their chronic medications withheld for a variety of reasons and new drugs commenced [1] . As patients are often under the care of a number of different medical teams during their admission there is potential for these changes to be inadvertently continued [2] . Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (In-S:PIRE) is a five week rehabilitation programme for patients and their caregivers after ICU (Intensive Care Unit) discharge at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Within this programme a medication review by the critical care pharmacist provided an opportunity to identify and resolve any pharmaceutical care issues and also an opportunity to educate patients and their caregivers about changes to their medication. Methods: During the medication review we identified ongoing pharmaceutical care issues which were communicated to the patient's primary care physician (GP) by letter or a telephone call. The patients were also encouraged to discuss any issues raised with their GP. The significance of the interventions was classified from those not likely to be of clinical benefit to the patient, to those which prevented serious therapeutic failure.",

Introduction: Daily blood tests are a long running feature of ICU care, and are regarded as an essential diagnostic tool by medical staff, however the risk of iatrogenic anaemia is a very real one and there are significant costs involved. 1 Methods: Existing guidelines are intended to limit excessive testing in stable patients. We audited adherence to these and also recorded trends in haematocrit and haemoglobin to identify cases of iatrogenic anaemia on the unit. In order to establish trends and to exclude stable post surgical patients, we limited eligible patients to those who were on the unit for 3 days or more. On six randomly assigned days over a 2 month period, all eligible patients on the unit had a proforma filled retrospectively for all days up until their admission to the unit, or up to seven days previously, whichever sooner. Presence of arterial or central access was also noted, as these facilitate obtaining samples. Results: We obtained 101 patient days worth of data across 20 patients who were considered eligible. Our results demonstrated that 54% of tests done were required but more importantly, 46% of tests carried out were deemed clinically unnecessary by a panel of three ICU physicians, and 48% were ordered despite the unit guidelines stating otherwise. The inpatient cost of carrying out the unnecessary blood tests added up to \u00a3842 and the amount of blood wasted totalled 1052 ml. Based on these figures, the average volume of unnecessary blood taken from a patient per week is 73 ml. Only 2 patients selected had no central or arterial line for part of their inspected days, and this had no effect as they had tests taken daily anyway.",

Introduction: Work-related stress with the accompanying emotions provoked specifically in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is well documented over the previous years. The high-stakes, high stress environment that ICU health care professionals (HCP) practice in, are demanding intellectually, physically, and emotionally. Work engagement has been operationalized as a positive work-related state of mind and characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. The aim of the study is to explore the influence of personal resources, e.g. empathic ability on work engagement among the ICU HCP. Methods: The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey study among ICU HCP (i.e. intensivists and nurses) of Erasmus MC, a university hospital in the Netherlands. A digital link to the questionnaire was sent in October 2015 to a given e-mail address of 163 nurses in a mixed ICU, 45 nurses in a thoracic ICU, 54 nurses in a cardiac ICU and 53 intensivists. Two reminders were sent. Work engagement was measured with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, which includes 17 items five point Likert items about how a person feels at work. Additionally, 14 items based on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy measured emphatic ability. Results: The overall response rate was 66%, with a male-female ratio of .47. The mean age of the respondents was 43.4 years, mean working hours/weeks rated 33.6, and 54% finished A-levels in education. ICU HCP scored the same on vigor, higher on dedication (p < .05), and lower on absorption (p < .05) compared to the average Dutch employee. They reported no more stress related symptoms such as mental distance and sleeping disorders. Although only 2.8% of the ICU HCP assessed workload as high, compared to 3.6%, the emotional burden scored higher (3.1 and 1.8 in respective, p < .05). General HCP acted as benchmark in empathic ability. ICU HCP showed an equal score on the cognitive component (3.9 compared to 4.0) and a lower score on the emotional component (3.0 compared to 3.8, p < .05). Mean cognitive empathy is positively correlated with vigor (r = .21) although both cognitive and emotional empathy did not correlate with work engagement.",

These patients had extremely high hospital mortality, despite differences in timing of consultation, diagnosis, PPS and definition of life support limitation. This data seems to support the notion that clinical deterioration during hospitalization may be seen as an opportunity to discuss end of life goals. Introduction: End-of-life (EOL) decision making in acute care is complex, involving difficult decision, such as whether to initiate or discontinue life support, place a feeding tube or a tracheostomy, or initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the event of a cardiac arrest. Methods: our critical care nurses suffer when they think they are performing procedures that are harmful or of low efficacy and when their advocacy is ineffective. Prolonged, unrecognized suffering can be detrimental and can lead to disengagement and silence. Habitual silence or silencing in the face of perceived wrongs can result in permanent, deleterous changes in ethical values (1) . In recent studies researchers suggested that false optimism is associated with medical activism or a strong need for control over death, which is prevalent in the western world.. or ignorance or some emotional anesthesia present in us. Results: Narratives enable those involved in the ICU to negotiate the meaning of critical care for the patient. Narrative functions as an interpretive procedure that allows diverse persons-we-nurses-patient, and patient's families-to make sense of critical care.... and supplies a theory and instrument for negotiating meaning throughout the process that respects the realities and limitations of such care. Conclusions: the effective practice of medicine requires \"narrative competence.. the ability to acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights of others\". The nurses that working with us every day are often caught in the middle-an ethically untenable position-as they attempt to comply with our medical directives and simultaneously protect and advocate for their patient.",

Thousands undergo euthanasia each year, but it is unclear what the potential of this procedure can be for the donor pool. Methods: It was not possible to obtain detailed euthanasia data from Dutch authorities. All Belgian euthanasia reports of 2013 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the number of patients which could donate at least 1 organ. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the number of potential donors per organ. Exclusion was based on the contraindications for donation within the Eurotransplant region. Cancer was an exclusion criterion as the majority of malignancies are a contra-indication for organ donation. Patients with \"Multiple pathologies\" were excluded, because they would be unlikely to be accepted as an organ donor. Patients with \"Other pathologies\" were excluded, because many mentioned contra-indications for donation or details about the pathology were lacking. For subgroup Fig. 107 (Abstract P450) .

Within the Eurotransplant region, 75 years is the maximum age for donation of kidneys, lungs and pancreas islet isolation in Maastricht category 3 deceased donors. For potential liver donors, a maximum age of 60 years was used and for whole pancreas donors 50 years. Results: Of 1811 obtained Belgian reports, a total of 186 potential donors with at least 1 suitable organ for donation remained. 6 patients with a history of kidney disease were excluded, leading to 360 potential kidney donations. For lung donation 31 patients were excluded leaving a potential of 155 lung donors. 113 patients between 60-79 years old were excluded, leaving 73 potential liver donors. For whole pancreas donation, the age group of 50-79 years was excluded, resulting in 30 potential pancreas donors. Conclusions: In this first analysis of Belgian data on euthanasia in order to explore the potential of organ donation after euthanasia, 10,3% of all euthanasia cases are potentially suitable patients for donation. Whether they are willing to donate is unclear and should be studied. If only a small percentage of these patients would consider donation, this could mean an increase in donation in Belgium and the Netherlands. Introduction: The ability to communicate well with patients and their relatives is a fundamental clinical skill in intensive care medicine and central to good medical practice. Communication at the bedside, even when the patient is unconscious or sedated, may often be recalled by critical care survivors and can impact upon long-term psychological outcomes [1] .The Intensive Care Society released guidelines for the provision of intensive care services and one area which was highlighted was the patient and relative perspective, the importance of effective communication with relatives and patients and valuable time spent talking to the patient [2] .The aim of this audit was to assess the communication skills on the daily ward rounds between the team leader, normally the on call Consultant, and the patient at the bedside. Methods: An observational study comprising of 32 daily ward rounds on the 14 bedded Critical Care Unit (CCU) at Whiston hospital between October and November 2015. An average of 11 patients per ward round were recorded including non-ventilated and ventilated patients. A data collection tool was used which assessed whether the Consultant leading the ward round introduced themselves, explained what their role was and introduced the rest of the team. Results: Out of the 348 patients who were on the CCU within this time period, the majority of these patients were not ventilated. Saying that it was found that only 53% of Consultants introduced themselves, 52% explained their role and 45% introduced the rest of the team. There seemed to be a significant difference in the communication between Consultants and ventilated patients, showing that only 16% introduced themselves, 14% explained their role and 11% introduced the rest of the team. Conclusions: The communication between patients and doctors within the CCU calls for vast improvement. Given the evidence as mentioned, it is imperative that strategies are put in place to help improve the results which were found. This would include a simple adjunct next to the bedside to help remind the Consultant about the importance of effective communication. It is worthwhile re-auditing once this implementation has been put in place to see whether communication has improved. Introduction: Communication with patients and families in critical care medicine (CCM) can be complex and challenging. Physicians benefit from dedicated communication teaching, although the ideal model has not been established. Our purpose was to develop and assess the impact of a communication skills curriculum for CCM fellows. Methods: Surveys including multiple choice and free-text questions were sent to all CCM fellows, staff physicians, nurses and social workers at our institution. The results informed the design of a longitudinal communication skills curriculum for CCM fellows. The effectiveness of the curriculum is being assessed through trends in clinician feedback. Results: The survey response rate was 7/7 fellows, 15/29 staff physicians, 56/404 nurses, and 1/5 social workers. More than 50% of non-fellow respondents identified that fellows ranked below expectations in counseling about the emotional impact of emergency situations; fellows reported they had the least amount of training in this area and were least comfortable addressing patient and family emotional issues. Staff physicians were least comfortable teaching and assessing fellows' capacity to address emotion, and had received the least amount of training in this area themselves. All non-trainee groups described fellows' focus on giving information over building rapport; fellows indicated their challenges may be related to the absence of a prior relationship with patients and families, and their own discomfort in talking about death and dying. Despite challenges in the relational aspects of communication, topics of greatest interest to fellows included organ donation, adverse events, conflict, and family meetings. Preferred learning methods included simulation and feedback in clinical practice. This data guided the development of a communication skills curriculum involving 5 formal sessions over a year, and structured feedback during CCM rotations. Each formal session consisted of a didactic presentation and simulated practice. One formal session was dedicated to basic principles of communication, which were incorporated into each of the topic-based sessions. A form to guide multidisciplinary preceptors in providing feedback to fellows in clinical practice was also developed and implemented. Preliminary data indicate that fellows value the curriculum and feedback; more objective curricular evaluation is ongoing. Conclusions: Kern's model has been valuable in developing a blended communication skills curriculum tailored to CCM fellows' needs. The curriculum has been received favorably. Introduction: Conflicts between healthcare professionals and patients' relatives are rather common in the intensive care unit (ICU). As a result of societies' increased ethnic diversity these conflicts more often involve actors with a different ethno-cultural background. However few is known about the specific nature of staff-family conflicts in a multiethnic ICU environment. In this study, we give an overview of some characteristics of conflicts between family members from ethnicminority groups and staff members and compare them to characteristics of staff-family conflict in general. Methods: Ethnographic fieldwork was done in 1 ICU of a multiethnic urban hospital in Belgium. During 6 months, data were collected through negotiated interactive observation, in-depth-interviews with staff, from patients' medical records, and by making notes in a logbook.",

            "text": "Data were analyzed via grounded theory and compared to the literature on staff-family conflict in general. Results: It is known that, in general, physicians identify a situation less often as conflict-loaded than relatives, suggesting the presence of hidden conflicts during critical care [1] [2] . However, in our studied multi-ethnic ICU conflicts were found to be explicitly recognized by both relatives as well as healthcare professionals, and to be very visible and auditable on the ward. Moreover where in general relativestaff conflict tend to be centered around crisis moments (end-of-life decision making, patients' death) [3] , we found that in a multi-ethnic ICU conflicts tend to be present during various care phases (curative phase, end-of-life decision making, non-curative phase, patients' death) and concern a broad spectrum of care aspects ( e.g. bedside care activities, seeking a second opinion), easily assaulting the core of actors' identity. Consequently, end-of-life decisions, often a difficult assignment in ICUs, might be even more problematical in a multiethnic context than in general, as tensions in the pre-end of life decision making phase might worsen conflicts in the end-of-life decision making phase. Conclusions: In ICUs, staff-family conflicts tend to be more severe and overtly present in a multi-ethnic context than in general. Therefore we urge for the development of specific and effective stafffamily conflict prevention strategies in a multi-ethnic ICU. Introduction: We sought to evaluate whether the succinct Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) [1] , a validated survey, may serve as a suitable alternative to the FS-ICU. Undertaking relative experience surveys annually was outlined as a quality indicator by the Scottish Intensive Care Society Quality Improvement Group in 2012. Over the past 5 years we have completed the FS-ICU annually. This is a lengthy survey covering aspects of care & decision making. The FSS has been previously validated in large US/Canadian studies [2] . More recently the Family Reported Experiences Evaluation (FREE) validated the FS-ICU in the UK, employing the survey across 20 different ICUs with approximately 7000 forms completed. Methods: The audit was conducted across both hospitals in the trust. Over 4 weeks we distributed the CCFNI to relatives of patients on ITU/HDU once decision to step down to a ward was made. We included a section for open comments at the end of the survey. Results: Over 4 weeks a total of 44 surveys were completed. Selected results are detailed below with comparison to results from similar questions in the FS-ICU survey. Quality of care: CCFNI: 77% of relatives felt that the best possible care was being given to the patient almost all the time. FS-ICU: 72% felt the care received from doctors was excellent & 71% felt the care received from nurses was excellent. Communication: CCFNI: 73% felt that explanations about the patient's condition were given in terms that they could understand almost all of the time & the remaining 27% felt explanations were understandable most of the time. FS-ICU: 69% felt staff provided understandable explanations excellently, 31% described this information as very good. Empathy: CCFNI: 84% stated that staff members showed an interest in how relatives were feeling almost all of the time and most of the time. FS-ICU: 72% stated that ICU staff were excellent in showing interest & consideration to relative needs, and 28% said staff were very good. Conclusions: Results suggest that relatives are satisfied with the care that their relatives received at the trust. The results appear to correlate well with those from the FS-ICU in several domains such as care, communication and empathy. We therefore propose that the CCFNI can be used as an alternative annual survey to measure relatives experience on ICU.",

Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the transcripts (3). Peer Review was undertaken to ensure credibility of the findings. Results: Findings: Six key themes were identified from these interviews: the social impact of volunteering, shared experiences; supporting others; personal boundaries; support needs and personal gain. The importance of peer support and having a shared understanding of participants needs were key themes for the volunteers. Volunteers described the need for further support in areas such as: confidentiality; listening skills and understanding boundaries. Conclusions: The use of peer volunteers in this ICU rehabilitation service has been successful within this local context. Further, larger scale research studies, which explore further the impact of volunteering for ICU survivors are required.",

This study shows factors associated with the apearence of anxiety and depression. Introduction: St Elisabeth Hospital has a 30 bed ICU for critically ill adult patients. We facilitate family centred care, but in earlier years children were not allowed to visit family members in our ICU. The objective of our project was to facilitate paediatric visitation and to provide support related to the distress and needs of children with a relative in our ICU. Methods: Practical aids were developed for our caregivers. An information leaflet was made with practical information for parents. This was subdivided in developmental stages. Furthermore we created a book in which a child visits his father at our ICU. Pictures show what children can expect, which helps prepare the child for visiting. An instruction box is included with ICU materials (Fig. 108) . These materials are used to give children a more tactile experience of the ICU. Guidance materials for when a patient may die were developed included. For example: there are little boxes that can be decorated by the children to put in a memory or a token of grief. Pedagogical staff are available to support parents, children and staff. If there are more profound problems there will be referral to our children's psychologist. Our hospital photographers can be called upon to commemorate the last moments (Fig. 109) . We instructed our nurses and doctors on how to use these materials and how to guide children. We held a survey among our staff to inquire if this met their needs. Results: There's an increasing awareness to the needs of children among our staff. Children and parents are welcomed and guided by our staff. Our survey amongst our staff showed a great appreciation for the materials we developed. When relatives of children die, children can be included in the farewell visit. Conclusions: When a child is confronted with a sick or dying parent, loss and sorrow are inevitable. We, as care givers, can be more than bystanders and can help parents guide their children in difficult times. ",

We hypothesized that baseline HRV variables and changes during resuscitation, may predict outcomes from critical illness. Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed on inpatients that required a Rapid Response Team (RRT) consultation. 24-hour holter monitoring and serial measurements of physiological and biochemical data were made. Heart rate variability was measured as time domains measured over 24 hours (SDNN, ASDNN, rMSSD, pNN50%, SDANN, mean NN) and frequency domains measured hourly (Very Low Frequency VLF, Low Frequency LF, High Frequency HF, Low/High ratio). The Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (RAC No. 2151069). Results: Fifty-three patients were enrolled, mean APACHE",

Study Selection Abstracts were screened by predefined criteria, then 289 full-text articles assessed for eligibility. After applying prespecified exclusion criteria, only 14 studies were included in the systematic review (total 20048 patients -14709 from one large study). Data Extraction Studies were analysed according to published quality criteria -cohort studies were awarded a Newcastle-Ottawa Score. Data Synthesis The low number of studies reviewed and their heterogeneity did not allow meta-analysis, so a narrative review was presented. Results: We found few papers presenting useful evidence -five cohort studies, one case series and seven case reports. We found no evidence for benefit from use of SSRI/SNRIs in critical care",

Conclusions: Patients with limitations of LSC are frequently admitted in IdtCU. Hospital mortality is high and associated with age, acute and preexisting organ failures, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Life support withdrawal includes NIV terminal weaning and palliative sedation. LSC limited hypercapnic patients appear to be safely treated with NIV. The very high mortality of most severe patients raises questions on appropriateness of care and use of acute care resources",

Administration of the dose of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids for hypotension or lactate 4 mmol/L (3 hours) and application of vasopressors (6 hours) was performed in both groups, without statistically significant differences. Statistically significant differences between survivors vs. nonsurvivors were found in the parameter \"Dose of norepinephrine in the first 24 hours\", 0.211 (0.022 -1.104) vs. 0.333 (0.039 -2.333), p < 0.001, OR (95 % IS) 2.009 (1.362; 2.965), p < 0.001 Conclusions:We found that a dose of norepinephrine affects the outcome of human septic shock.

Methods: Scoping review of publications (1980-2015) reporting the effect of any intervention on outcomes for postoperative bleeding (mediastinal drain loss, transfusion requirement, coagulation parameter). Inclusions: <18 years, cardiac surgery on CPB. Exclusions: haematological disorders. Databases included MEDLINE and EMBASE. Results: 548/2794 screened articles were included: 466 (85.0 %) original research, predominantly retrospective 175 (37.6 %) and prospective 119 (25.5 %) observational studies, a smaller proportion of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 85 (18.2 %) and non-randomised controlled trials 24 (5.2 %)(Fig. 24). Study sizes ranged 5 -22,258 (median 62). Most frequently evaluated interventions: blood products (17.3 %), CPB circuit modification (13.6 %), antifibrinolytics (13.2 %)(Fig. 24). Publication numbers increased at a mean rate of 6 per year from14 (1980-85)  to 229 (2010-15). Within this group the raise of increase of RCTs was 0 (1980-85) to 35 (2010-15). Conclusions: A variety of interventions for bleeding prevention/treatment are available. Trial sizes are often small, quality of evidence low.

Changes in mean arterial pressure (\u0394MAP) systolic arterial pressure (\u0394Sys) and diastolic arterial pressure(\u0394Dias) were analysed in a regression models against the values of EaDyn , at baseline, adjusted by baseline values of the haemodynamic of interest (i.e. MAP) and the presence of mechanical ventilation. Results: There is no evidence that EaDyn at baseline predicts the \u0394MAP (p = 0.17), \u0394Sys (p = 0.21) or \u0394Dias (p = 0.17). The mechanical ventilation was a significant predictor of changes in MAP (p = 0.003), Systolic (p = 0.001) and Diastolic (p = 0.001). Conclusions: EaDyn calculated with LiDCOplus and adjusted by baseline arterial pressure does not predict changes in arterial pressure after a fluid challenge in post-operative patients.P161 Analysis of duration of post-operative goal-directed therapy protocol C.

The aim of this study in a cohort of septic patients during RRT with CPFA or Cytosorb is to evaluate with tromboelastography monitoring (TEG) three different methods of anticoagulation 1-Heparin anticoagulation. 2-Citrate anticoagulation with 10 mmol / L Citrate. 3-Citrate anticoagulation with18 mmol/ L Citrate. Methods: Thirty patients submitted to CPFA or Cytosorb had three different methods of anticoagulation :1-Unfractioned Heparin (group A). 2 -10 mmol/L Citrate (group B) 3-18 mmol/ Citrate. (Group C). All patients had monitoring of coagulation, ACT, and TEG at basal time (T0) and after 6 hours (T1). Blood samples for TEG were collected from the patient's artery (site 1) and post hemofilter (CPFA) or post cartridge (Cytosorb) (site 2). All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. ANOVA test was used for the statistical study. Results: the TEG data is show inTable 22. Statistical comparison was made for the same site.Conclusions: 1-During CPFA or Cytosorb RRT Heparine increased R (delay in activation of coagulation ) and decreased MA ( less cloth strength ) in patients , increasing the risk of bleeding. 2-18 mmol/L citrate anticoagulation decreased MA and increased R in circuits better then in Group A and B, achieving an optimal extracorporeal anticoagulation.

Methods: The preop. plasma levels of cystatin C and creatinine were measured in 1638 patients undergoing CABG. eGFRcystatin-C and eGFRcreatinine were calculated using two pairs of estimating equations, CAPA-LMrev, and CKD-EPIcystatin C and CKD-EPIcreatinine, respectively. The patients were studied over a median follow-up time of 3.5 years (2.0-5.0 y) and the mortality determined. Results: The Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that the preop presence of SPS independently predicts poorer survival in addition to previously known risk factors. The five year survival for all patients was (mean \u00b1 95 % CI) 90.0 \u00b1 1.2 %,. Survival for patients with SPS defined by the equation pair CAPA-LMrev was 58.8 \u00b1 9.0 %. Survival for patients with SPS by the equation pair CKD-EPIcystatin C-creatinine was 65.1 \u00b1 0.6 %. Conclusions: SPS is a strong, independent, predictor of mortality. Reference Grubb.

Even though there are developments in tissue matching and immunesupressive protocols, graft loss is still an important problem after live-kidney transplantations because of acute and chronic allograft nephropathy. We aimed to assess the survival rates of patients and grafts after live-kidney transplantation.Methods:The results of live-kidney transplantations between years 2011-2014 were reviewed. Patients' age, gender and tissue antigen integration were determined. The chronic rejection and primary graft failure rates were recorded. Survival rates of the grafts and patients during 3,6,9,12,24,36 and 48 months were determined. Results: The number of kidney transplantations was 11755 between 2011-2014. The source of organ in 80.8 % of the transplantations was live-donors.

Decruyenaere Ghent University Hospital, Gent, Belgium Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P227Introduction: Long-term outcome and quality-of-life (QoL) in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) after failure to wean is scarcely documented. However, due to improvements of respiratory care in the ICU, an increasing amount of patients requires PMV. This study evaluates long-term survival and QoL in patients treated by tracheostomy for difficult weaning, with or without need for PMV at ICU discharge. Methods: We retrospectively investigated post-ICU trajectories and survival in patients admitted at the medical ICU of a tertiary center between 1999 and 2013. Only patients requiring tracheostomy for respiratory failure of varying etiology and difficult weaning were included. Patients were discriminated between those who did or did not require ventilation at ICU discharge. Patient characteristics affecting survival rates were examined. QoL assessment was done in survivors using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire in 2014. Results: A total of 114 patients was included, of whom 59 required mechanical ventilation at ICU discharge and 55 were weaned from ventilation at that point. One-year survival rates were 73 % and 69 %, respectively. In patients with a follow-up of at least five years, 5-years survival rates were 40 % (16/40) for ventilated and 42 % (14/33) for weaned patients. In the ventilated group, survival rates were significantly lower in the elderly (p = 0.001) and in patients with a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.02) or chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001). QoL was assessed in 21 ventilated and 22 weaned patients after a median of 58 and 52 months. Response rates were 84 % and 81 %, respectively. Overall, QoL scores for physical functioning were low in both groups. QoL for physical functioning, assessed with SF-36, was lower in the ventilated (8/100) than in the weaned group (20/100). Scores for social functioning and mental health were less below norm and similar between both groups (62 and 52/100 vs. 62 and 48/100, respectively). A similar trend was observed with the SRI questionnaire.",

Gursel Gazi University School of Medicine Respiratory Medicine and Critical Care Department, Ankara, Turkey Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P237Introduction: Metabolic alkalosis (MA) represents up to half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients and it is important to know that if it is interact with the noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy in hypercapnic respiratory failure. Because of the frequent diuretic and steroid usage lots of hypercapnic patients with COPD and heart failure requiring NIV are also at risk for MA and it may cause hypoventilation. While many reasons of NIV failure have been studied and defined extensively MA as a reason of NIV failure has not been investigated in hypercapnic respiratory failure yet. The aim of this study is to assess if MA influence NIV success and intensive care unit (ICU) outcome in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and receiving NIV therapy. Methods: Data of 206 patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and treated with NIV screened retrospectively. Patients who received asetozolamid during the NIV therapy excluded from the study. We investigated frequency, risk factors for the development of MA and if MA effects PaCO2 reduction rate, NIV, ICU and hospital stay and mortality. Results: Sixty one of 206 (30 %) patients developed MA at 3rd day and this group were older, more obese, had heart failure and used loop diuretics more often than the other group Lenght of NIV, ICU, hospital stay were longer in MA group than the non-MA group (p:0.024, 0.006, 0.001 respectively). Arterial blood gas values at the day of MA was pH: 7.45 PaO2: 71 mmHg, PaCO2: 58 mmHg HCO3:41 meq. Admission diagnosis of heart failure increased development of MA risk 3.4 times (OR:3,4 (CI 95 %:1,6-7) p:0,001). 190 mg of furosemid dose determined as cutt of point for the development of MA (AUC = 0,782 p < 0,001, sensitivity 68 %, specifity 80 %). Duration of NIV was significantly longer in patients with MA but it was independent risk factor for only hospital stay longer than 10 days (OR:3.4, CI95%:1,7-6,8), p < 0.0001).",

Direct measurement of respiratory effort in non-intubated patients is difficult, so clinicians rely on secondary indicators of respiratory sufficiency, such as pulse oximetry & capnography (EtCO2), which have significant limitations. Clinicians often resort to using respiratory rate (RR) measurements from the capnograph. We used a novel non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM), which measures minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) & respiratory rate (RR), to assess the ability of EtCO2generated RR to quantify respiratory status in non-intubated patients.Methods: Continuous RVM & capnography data were collected from 50 subjects (age:46 \u00b1 14 yrs) using an impedance-based RVM (ExSpiron) & capnograph (Capnostream 20) with a sampling oral/nasal cannula (Smart Capnoline Plus). Each subject performed 6 2.5-min breathing trials at various RRs. The correlations between EtCO2 measurements (low: <35 mmHg, normal: 35-45 mmHg, high: >35 mmHg), capnographybased RR (low: <6 b/min, adequate: > = 6 b/min), & RVM-based MV (low: <2 L/min, adequate: > = 2 L/min) were evaluated. Results: Comparison of MV & EtCO2 measurements revealed that in only 24.6 % of the 9324 analyzed epochs did adequate MV coincide with normal EtCO2. 68.7 % of the time adequate MV coincided with low EtCO2, & 100 % of low MV corresponded to either normal or low EtCO2",

Numerous studies have demonstrated a poor outcome with patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pulmonary fibrosis [1-2]. Methods: A computerised hospital database was used to search for all patients admitted to the ICU at East Surrey Hospital with pulmonary fibrosis between 2003-2015. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel 2007 and GraphPad software. The primary endpoint was survival at unit and hospital discharge.",

It has been recognised as an objective prognostic marker of disease severity and frailty. The aim of this study is to determine, whether phase angle is a marker of malnutrition and postoperative morbidity in low operative risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. The nutrition state of cardiac surgery patients was evaluated using BIA the day before scheduled surgery. After applying selection criteria, 342 low operative risk patients were selected and classified into two groups in accordance to PA value: a low PA group and normal PA group. The correlation between low phase angle and low fat free mass index (FFMI), a marker of malnutrition, was assessed. Associations between low phase angle and adverse postoperative outcomes, defined by STS postoperative risk evaluation model, were analysed. The impact of low PA on length of stay in ICU and hospital was evaluated. Results: Low PA was detected in 61 (17,8 %) patients in the selected group, which consisted of low operative risk patients with median Euroscore II value of 1,46 [IQR:0,97-2,03] and was associated with FFMI with Pearson's R of 0,515 (p < 0,001). Low PA was associated with higher rates (13 (21,3 %) vs. 30 (10,7 %) p = 0,023) and risk of postoperative morbidity in univariate regression analysis (OR = 2,27,Cl95% = 1,10-4,66, p = 0,026). Furthermore, low PA persisted as an independent factor in multivariate regression analysis (OR = 2,50,CI95% 1,18-5,29, p = 0,016) adjusted for preoperative risk factors of postoperative morbidity. Evaluation of hospitalization length revealed tendency of a prolonged hospitalization (>14 days) rate (31 (50,8 %) vs. 105 (37,8 %), p = 0,063) in the group with low PA. Conclusions: A low preoperative phase angle is an indicator of malnutrition and determines adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. Further research is needed to evaluate clinical applications of the phase angle, such as a more accurate identification of malnourished cardiac surgery patients.

They both have low sensitivity, particularly among patients already receiving antibiotics. Another limitation is the prolonged time that it takes for diagnostic results to become available, which can adversely impact therapy and clinical outcomes. Molecular techniques to diagnose CRBSI are less established. No study to date has attempted to diagnose CVC related infections in septic ICU population using molecular techniques. Our study tested different molecular techniques designed specifically to diagnose CVC associated infections and compared them to standard CVC tip and blood cultures. We also attempted a new culture method for CVC tips using saline vortexing. Methods: ICU patients with a CVC suspected of having sepsis were included. Blood was extracted for PCR and regular cultures. CVCs were extracted and tips were cultured by the semiquantitive method and also vortexed in saline which was subjected to PCR and regular cultures. PCR was done both by Biofire commercial kit (multiplex PCR) and by RT-PCR using unique primers targeting common ICU organisms. Organism load was quantified using threshold cycle (Ct) with a cutoff of 35 used for a positive result. All methods were compared.Results: A total of 22 blood samples and CVC tips were tested. The Biofire kit and the RT-PCR identified as positive 75 % of positive CVC cultures.The Biofire kit failed to identify positive blood samples.The RT-PCR identified 66 % of them. The Biofire kit did not identify false positive samples. The RT-PCR had a false positive rate of 35 % of negative CVC tips and 67 % of negative blood samples. Blood for standard cultures was drawn prior to antibiotics in 41 % of patients, but almost all patients received antibiotics before blood was drawn for PCR. CVC line tip vortex fluid cultures showed excellent concordance with standard tip cultures.Conclusions: These molecular systems show promise for rapid line sepsis identification. False negativity is probably related to prior antimicrobial treatment. The RT-PCR also had some false positivity possibly reflecting potential treatable organisms missed by standard cultures. The commercial multiplex PCR kit showed lower sensitivity than the RT-PCR. Between June and October 2015, we disseminated an online questionnaire, available in 10 languages, to medical doctors and nurses working in ICUs through national and international ICU societies. We investigated clinical practices related to central line (CL) insertion, maintenance and measurement of CLABSI-related data.

Jarupongprapa Nakhonpathom hospital, Nakhonpathom, Thailand Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P065 Introduction: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common source of bacteremia in community setting. Predicting risk of bacteremia can help the clinicians determine the appropriate site of care and therapy. Previous studies were performed on factors associated with bacteremia, however, produced inconclusive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristics to predict bacteremia in community acquired UTI. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at Nakhonpathom hospital, a 670-bed tertiary care hospital in Thailand during December 2014 and August 2015. Inclusion criteria were age [>=] 18 years, fever, at least 1 symptom of UTI (dysuria, frequent or urgent urination, flank pain or costovertebral tenderness) and pyuria (defined by a presence of [>=] 5 WBC per high power field in a centrifuged sediment). Patients were excluded if they: (1) had healthcare associated infection; (2) had taken antibiotics during 72 h prior to hospitalization; (3) presented with severe sepsis/septic shock. Clinical factors associated with bacteremia were determined. Results: There were 106 patients. The mean [SD] age was 44 [17] years and 93 % were female. Twenty-two patients (20.8 %) had diabetes melliutus, while 9 (8.5 %) and 4 (3.7 %) had stone and structural abnormality of urinary system, respectively. Bacteremia was found in 16 patients (15 %). [i]E.coli[/i] was the most common organism (13 cases), followed by MSSA (2 cases) and [i]Proteus mirabilis[/i] (1 case). Surprisingly, 6 of 13 isolates (46.2 %) of [i]E.coli[/i] were ESBL producer. Patients who had bacteremia were more likely to have older age (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [12.6] vs 42.3 [16.9] years, p 0.004), diabetes mellitus (40 % vs 16 %, p 0.04), chill (100 % vs 61 %, p 0.01), higher body temperature (mean [SD] temperature, 101.3 [33.6] vs 100.0 [34.0] F, p 0.04), BUN/Cr ratio [>=] 16 (67 % vs 41 %, p 0.07) and CRP [>=] 20 mg/L (92 % vs 61 %, p 0.05). Multivariate analysis of factors with p < 0.1 in univariate analysis showed that BUN/Cr ratio [>=] 16 (OR 4.5, 95%CI 1.1-18.7, p 0.04) and CRP [>=] 20 mg/L (OR 10.8, 95%CI 1.3-93.4, p 0.03) were associated with bacteremia. Conclusions: BUN/Cr ratio and CRP level can be used to guide the probability of bacteremia in community acquired UTI.",

Arabi King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P074Introduction: The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been increasing in the general population. In this study, we examined the prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), its risk factors and the association with morbidity and mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who were admitted to the ICU of a tertiary-care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2011, had nasal swab for MRSA colonization on admission and stayed in the ICU for >48 hours. We calculated the MRSA colonization prevalence and studied the association between MRSA colonization status and patient characteristics and outcomes, including infections due to MRSA and mortality. Results: The cohort included 464 patients with the following characteristics: age = 51.7 \u00b1 21.9 years, APACHE II score = 23.3 \u00b1 8.7, 65.9 % males and mostly admitted from the emergency department (40.7 %) and wards (30.2 %). Thirty-one (6.7 %) patients were MRSA colonized and had similar age, gender distribution, chronic comorbidities and admission APACHE II score compared with the other patients. Patients referred from other hospitals had the highest prevalence (19.4 % versus 6.2 % for the other patients, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis with age, gender, APACHE II score and source of admission (other hospitals versus other source) being the independent variables, only admission to the ICU from another hospital was associated with MRSA colonization (odds ratio, 4.01; 95 % confidence interval, 1.48-10.90; p = 0.006). Only 3 (0.6 %) patients in the cohort had MRSA bacteremia during ICU stay and all were MRSA colonized (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 14 patients had respiratory tract infection due to MRSA, 9 (64.3 %) of whom were MRSA colonized (p < 0.001). MRSA colonized patients had similar hospital mortality (38.7 % versus 41.8 %, p = 0.74) and length of stay (42 \u00b1 43 versus 55 \u00b1 97 days, p = 0.48) compared with the other patients. Conclusions: MRSA nasal colonization was present in 6.7 % of ICU patients and was associated with MRSA bacteremia and respiratory tract infections, but not with mortality.P075 Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection in intensive care unit patients in a hospital with building construction: Is there an association?

Methods: In a prospective single-centre study all patients, who spent > 48 hours in the ICU, where screened for MDROs during a 6 month period from September 2014-February 2015. The clinical setting was a 30-bed mixed ICU in the Netherlands. Baseline characteristics were collected. Surveillance screening included rectal cultures on admission and at dismissal and sputum cultures twice weekly. Clinical cultures only on indication. Outcome measures included ventilator time in days, median [range], VAP in patients, n (%), sepsis in patients, n (%), length of stay (LOS) ICU in days, median [range] and 30-day survival in patients, n (%). Statistics included the \u03b1 -test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: 311 patients were included, 173 men, median age 64 years [18-90], median APACHE II 18 [3-73]. A total of 27 MDROs were found in 23 patients. Rectal cultures on admission revealed 17 MDROs in 14 patients, 10 MDROs were cultured in predominately sputum cultures in 9 patients during ICU stay. MDROs included 15 E. coli, 4 Klebsiella spp., E. cloacae, M. morganii, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. all 1, 2 S. Pneumoniae, 1 MRSA and 1 VRE. As only 1 patient had a MDRO positive blood culture colonisation appears more frequent than infection. MDRO+ patients were placed in full contact isolation. Ventilator time, VAP, sepsis and LOS ICU were significant higher in MDRO+ patients(Table 9). There was no significant difference in 30-day survival 19 (83 %) versus 220 (76 %), p = 0.50. Conclusions: MDROs were found in a small percentage of the patients. As MDRO+ patients had a longer ventilator time and LOS ICU they may be more sensitive to VAP and sepsis. A large part of MDROs was imported into the ICU. This underscores the importance of our MDRO Prevention program: surveillance cultures, special attention to hand hygiene and washing with 2 % chlorhexidine cloths.P077 Epidemiology and risk factors of ICU acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram negative bacilli Y.

This problem specially affects the intensive care units (ICUs). Usually at ICU, staff and residents develop an exercise of learning and capture of decisions at the patient bedside. Probably this way of work should change.Results: Since the formation of the GEO, number of new carbapenemresistant cases decreased drastically. Three new cases were reported on February, two cases on March and one on April. Since May, the cases of colonization by carbapenem resistant bacteria within the ICU have been reduced to those cases imported from other units; there have been exceptional cases generated on the unit. In these ones the failure of defense was identified, reported, and measures were taken for further occasions. Conclusions: The growing emergence of multirresistant bacteria is a real threat forcing us to adapt and change our way of working. Good coordination among hospital workers is the most effective tool as a firewall against these infections. The implementation of the techniques previously described has proven to be an effective fighting technique against carbapenemases producing bacteria. The objective of this study is to characterize and to delineate predictors of bad outcome in patients hospitalized in an Infectious Diseases Intensive/Intermediate Care Unit (ID-ICU). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to the ID-ICU with the diagnosis of MSF between 1992 and 2014. The patients were identified in our department database and subsequently the clinical records were consulted. The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were its predictors. We used the most appropriate measure of central tendency and distribu-",

Methods: All adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed medico-surgical ICU who were diagnosed with confirmed MERS-CoV between Oct 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014 were included. The diagnosis was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory samples.Results: During the observation period, 31 patients were identified as having MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 \u00b1 20 years, 71 % males). The median number of concomitant comorbid conditions was 3 (IQ: 2-4). The initial clinical manifestations of the MERS-CoV infections had occurred at a median of 2 days (IQ: 2-4) prior to hospital admission. Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were evident in 77.4 % of cases. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 87.1 % of the patients during the ICU stay, vasopressor therapy in 80.6 %, and renal replacement therapy in 51.6 %. The overall ICU mortality rate was 74.2 %. The median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQ: 4-16) and 12 (IQ: 4-16) days, respectively. Nonsurvivors were older (63 \u00b1 19 vs. 46 \u00b1 20 years, p = 0.48), had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission to the ICU, and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation (95.7 vs. 62.5 %, p = 0.48) and vasopressor therapy (95.7 vs. 37.5 %, p = 0.002). Conclusions: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Possible risk factors for death include older age, greater severity scores and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressor therapy.P082 The ICU response to a hospital outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection H.

Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) can be measured in most critical care patient and is an useful tool for this purpose. Calculations of cardiac output needing aortic valve area are strongly dependent on skills and observers. We hypothesize that LVOT-VTI is an accurate estimation of stroke volume index (SVI). The objective of the study was to assess the correlation between SVI and LVOT-VTI. Methods: Three ICU from different university hospitals participated in the study. Consecutive patients with haemodynamic monitoring on mechanical ventilation were included. Patient with aortic valve regurgitation or dynamic stenosis on the LVOT were excluded from the study. LVOT-VTI was measured by pulsatile doppler echocardiography. Five measurements of LVOT-VTI were obtained on each patient. Mean and maximum values were recorded. Simultaneously, five measurement of SVI by floating pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) or Pulse Induced Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) thermodilution methods were obtained and the mean was recorded. Mean and maximum LVOT-VTI were correlated with mean invasive SVI. Statistical analysis: correlation was assessed by Pearson correlation index and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: One hundred and two paired measurements were recorded in thirty two patients. One patient was excluded from the study due to the difficulty to obtain an adequate acoustic window. Twenty one patients were monitorized by PiCCO and eleven by PAC. The Pearson correlation index between LVOT-VTI en SVI was r LVOT-VTI could be useful as a non-invasive simple method to estimate SVI in most of mechanically ventilated patients.

We studied VRdp and RVR response to hypo-and hypervolemia in pigs with intact circulation. Methods: We measured in anesthetized pigs (n = 10; 2 early deaths) pulmonary artery blood flow (Q PA ; ultrasonic flow probe), RAP and MSFP (venous pressure at zero flow during right atrial balloon occlusion; MSFP RAO ) at baseline, after bleeding of 9 mL/ kg body weight (hypovolemia) and after retransfusion of the shed blood and an equal amount of hydroxyethyl starch (hypervolemia). Blood volume (BV; indocyanine green dye dilution) was measured at baseline and hypervolemia and calculated for hypovolemia as BV baseline minus shed volume. Stressed volume (V s ) was defined from systemic vascular compliance (C vasc = \u0394 BV/\u0394 MSFP RAO ) at MSFP RAO = 0. Statistics: analysis of variance for repeated measures. The parallel changes in BV, VRdp and Q PA , estimated by mutually independent methods, support the Guytonian model and stress the importance of RAP as backpressure to venous return.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (2015:CRD42015019539). We searched the PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL databases for articles in English. Inclusion criteria were RCTs studying adult patients with critical illness, treated in an intensive care unit. The intervention should be protocolized and based on results from hemodynamic measurements, defined as cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke volume variation, oxygen delivery, central venous oxygenation (ScvO2) or mixed venous oxygenation (SvO2). The control group should be treated without any structured intervention mentioned above. Exclusion criteria were pediatric, animal and perioperative studies. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were weight gain or fluid balance. Risk of bias was assessed independently of each other by two investigators. Statistical analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Preliminary results: Out of 575 screened papers, eight RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria were found. None of the eight studies were completely blinded. A total of 5323 patients were enrolled in the included studies. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the groups. Mortality in the hemodynamic intervention group was 23.6 % (630/2664 patients) vs. 24.1 % (641/2659 patients) in the control group, OR 0.96 (95 % CI 0.82-1.11) P = 0.95. I2 = 19 %. Conclusions: There is no evidence in the literature that hemodynamic monitoring combined with a structured intervention reduces mortality in critically ill patients. To investigate if mortality can be reduced by individualized hemodynamic management the monitoring has to be reliable, the intervention must be directed towards a meaningful treatment goal and the controls should receive standard of care.P163 Effectiveness of fluid thoracic content measurement by bioimpedance guiding intravascular volume optimization in patients with septic shock M. Aguilar Arzapalo, L. Barradas, V. Lopez, M. Cetina Hospital O'horan, M\u00e9rida, Mexico Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P163Introductions: Appropriate resuscitation and intravascular volume optimization are treatment cornerstone in septic shock. Optimization requires invasive monitoring and static measurements, due to it, is necessary a non invasive, fast and dynamic method. Thoracic fluid content (TFC) by thoracic bioimpedance surge as a monitoring system that fulfils the requirements: non invasive, easy placement and dynamic. Methods: Sixty patients were enrolled, divided in two groups with 30 subjects each, admitted at ICU with septic shock diagnosis. F Group was formed by patients in whom TFC was measured by thoracic bioimpedance, in order to guide intravascular volume optimization; C Group patients were optimized following \"Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines\", recording mortality at ICU discharge and at 28 days, mechanical ventilation length and ICU length of stay.Results: Based on TFC F Group obtained a faster and higher Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) increasing up to 42.5 % at 6 hours, compared to C Group where MAP arise only 19.5 % at 6 hours (p:<0.05). Due to lactate clearance F Group, obtained a total clearance of 54.4 % and 66.6 % at 6 and 12 hours, on C Group clearance just came up to 25.3 % and 35.8 % at 6 and 12 hours (p: 0.001). A higher mortality at ICU discharge was reach on C Group with 33.4 % vs 26.7 % (p: 0.001) from F Group, 28 day mortality was 36.5 % and 27.8 % (p:0.003) on C and F Group respectively. Conclusions: Measurement of thoracic fluid content by thoracic bioimpedance is effective while optimizing intravascular volume in septic shock.P164 A systematic review on the role of internal jugular vein ultrasound measurements in assessment of volume status in critical shock patients N.

Luciani Policlinico Modena, Bologna, Italy Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P164 Introductions: Previous studies tested the role of the internal jugular vein ultrasound exam (IJVUE) in the prediction of volume status but there are divergent conclusions on the its effectiveness in shock patients. For this reason we conducted a systematic review to check the level of reliability, validity and correlation with Central Venous Pressure (CVP) of the IJV ultrasound measures and the quality of reporting of literature on this topic. Methods: This review was based on the PRISMA guideline. The systematic search of the literature published from 1941 through 30 June 2015 explored the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were studies who investigated the reliability, the accuracy in predicting low CVP and the correlation with CVP of the IJV ultrasound measures in adult (>18 yrs) spontaneously breathing patients in shock. Three researchers selected studies using inclusion criteria and then assessed their quality using the STARD and QUADAS guidelines. The key words for literature search were: internal jugular veins, ultrasonography, volume status, central venous pressure, shock. Results: We collected 219 studies: 20 excluded with reasons, 194 because duplicates. Five studies were included for the final analysis: 3 on reliability , 4 on correlation with CVP , 5 on validity. The IJV ultrasound measures (IJV ratio, anterior-posterior IJV diameter [AP-IJVD], IJV area) showed an inter-rater agreement range from moderate to excellent .

These two groups were compared, especially in terms of fluid balance and mechanical ventilation requirements. of massive transfusion and 52 % of severe trauma head injury. After analysis of LFM,157 patients (53 %) were classified as conservative LFM and 137 (47 %) as liberal LFM. These two groups did not significantly differ in term of baseline characteristics, severe injuries, severity criteria or transfusion needs. Daily and cumulative fluid balances were also identical between these groups from Day 0 to Day 2. Conversely, liberal LFM was significantly associated with more ventilation days (11 vs 8.5 days; P = 0.02), less ventilator-free days at Day 30 (19 vs 21 days; P = 0.03), longer ICU stay (19 vs 16 days; P = 0.03) and hospital stay (30 vs 25 days; P = 0.04). Mortality rates were comparable between both groups (6 %). Multivariate analysis also highlighted that liberal LFM was independent risk factor for a reduced ventilator-free days at Day 30 (B = -2.1 [95%CI -4.1--0.1], P = 0.042), as well as ISS score, severe trauma head injury and massive transfusion needs. Conclusions: Liberal LFM was associated in our series with higher morbidity in the severe trauma patient; longer ventilation durations, and longer ICU and hospital stay.

However, as with any therapy, fluids can be associated with harm, such as added or worsening organ dysfunctions. This study aimed to determine the impact of fluid balance (FB) in the respiratory, cardiovascular, renal systems. Methods: Single-center prospective and observational study between June and December of 2014. All patients staying in ICU for more than 8 days were collected. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, the total amount of fluids administered and excreted, blood creatinine and urea, the need and dose of vasopressors, PaO2, FiO2, MAP were collected regarding the first 8 days in the ICU.

Observational studies showed that resuscitation with normal saline when compared to balanced crystalloids, is associated with acute kidney injury and death. In these studies a large volume of saline was administered. A 1 liter (L) fluid bolus is often administered in ICU patients, e.g. for hypotension or oliguria. It remains uncertain if this limited volume is also associated with adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a fluid bolus of saline (S) and Plasma-Lyte (PL), a balanced crystalloid, on electrolytes, acid-base status, hemodynamics and urine output (UO). Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized single blinded study comparing a 1 L fluid bolus of S and PL administered over 60 min, on a ICU cohort of 51 patients between 21th July 2015 and 3rd November 2015.

Methods: After approval by the local veterinary authorities, 10 female sheep were anaesthetized. After Baseline measurements 3x 10 ml blood per kg body weight were withdrawn to establish haemorrhagic Shock. Sheep were randomized to receive either 0,9 % NaCl (Saline group, n = 5) or Volulyte\u00ae (HES group, n = 5) for Resuscitation until Baseline values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were reached again. At Baseline, Shock and after Resuscitation haemodynamic variables and 5 videos of conjunctival microcirculation were recorded (CytoCam\u00ae, Braedius, Huizen, The Netherlands). The perfused vessel density (PVD) and microvascular flow index (MFI) were calculated using a dedicated software (AVA Software v3.2, MicroVisionMedical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

(2) Aiyagari V, Deibert E, Diringer MN. Hypernatremia in the neurologic intensive care unit: How high is too high? J Crit Care. 2006;21(2):163-172.Introductions: The development of hypernatraemia leads to hypertonic stress within the cells. Previous studies have shown that the presence of hypernatraemia on admission to Intensive Care is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. While rapid correction of hypernatraemia can have devastating neurological consequences; a correction speed too slow is associated with an increased risk of death. The primary objective was to assess the frequency of severe hypernatraemia in patients admitted to our Critical Care Unit, located in a tertiary referral centre and university hospital. Time to sodium normalisation, presence/absence of neurological symptoms and patient outcome was also evaluated. Severe hypernatraemia was classified as plasma sodium \u2265160 mmol per litre.Methods: We retrospectively searched the Critical Care database for laboratory sodium values \u2265160 mmol/L occurring between November 2013 and November 2015. Where appropriate, sodium was corrected for glucose. This identified all patients in whom severe hypernatremia was present on admission and those in whom it developed during their Critical Care stay. Results: We identified 14 patients with severe hypernatraemia over the past two years in our Critical Care Unit. The plasma sodium range was 160 to 196 mmol/L. All values > 170 mmol/L occurred in patients with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). The underlying aetiology was as follows: 4 (28.6 %) patients HHS, 1 (7.1 %) patient diabetic ketoacidosis, 1 (7.1 %) patient lithium-induced diabetes insipidus and 8 (57.1 %) patients with dehydration secondary to unreplaced water loses. In no case was the rate of correction greater than 10 mmol/L per day. The average length of time for correction to normal sodium level of 145 mmol/L was 6 days. Three patients (21.4 %) died in Critical Care. Two patients (14.3 %) died following discharge to the ward. The remaining 9 patients (64.3 %) were discharged home to their primary residence. All patients had neurological symptoms on presentation, primarily confusion. One patient presented with seizures. All patients were treated with 5 % dextrose. One patient developed hypernatraemia in Critical Care. Moderately elevated sodium levels were untreated in this patient prior to the diagnosis of severe hypernatraemia. The remaining patients all presented with hypernatraemia.Conclusions: Severe hypernatraemia is associated with a high mortality rate of 35.7 %. Physicians should be aware of the excessive risk associated with this condition and diagnosis should be followed by prompt rehydration and intensive clinical and biochemical monitoring.Introductions: Critical illness is a life-threatening multisystem process that can result in significant morbidity or mortality. In most patients, critical illness is preceded by a period of physiological deterioration; but evidence suggests that the early signs of this are frequently missed.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the medical data of all critically ill patients admitted to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital were reviewed between January 2013 and September 2015. Data including age, gender, SAPS III score upon admission, arrival and 24 hour ABG and electrolytes values, as well as length of stay and in-hospital mortality rate were collected. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between acid-base and electrolyte disturbances and in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results: Of the 4732 patients, 57 % were male; mean age of 58 years old, mean SAPS III score of 58 points and 33,8 % of them died in the hospital. Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients who developed mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis on their admission day (OR = 3.45, p-value < 0.001).Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis (OR = 3.91, 95 % CI = 1.37-10.21, p-value = 0.003) and hyponatremia (OR = 0.58, 95 % CI = 0.31-0.65, p-value 0.01), patients with hyperkalemia had higher mortality (serum potassium over 5,1 mEq/L 43,4 % died and serum potassium over 6,0 mEq/L 76,5 % died; p 0.01 and p 0,002 respectively), were three significant predictors of mortality, regardless of other confounding variables.Conclusions:The results show that in critically ill patients initial mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are significant predictors of mortality, but other factors after adjustment for potential confounding factors had no prognostic effect.

Correlation between poor functional levels and adverse outcomes has been found. KPS is used in decision making surrounding starting aggressive therapy. We evaluated the impact of KPS on long term renal & patient survival in AKI patients, receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) in intensive care (ICU). Methods: We prospectively enrolled AKI ICU patients between October 2011 & October 2013. Demographics, APACHE II and SOFA scores, modality & dose of RRT, ICU length of stay (LOS) and KPS were collected. Data on renal and patient survival at ICU discharge, at 28 and 90 days and also 12 months were collected. Analysis used was multivariate logistic regression (Stata 14.1) Results: 155 patients were recruited. 97 (62.6 %) were males. Median age was 62 (IQR 47-72). Median APACHE II score was 23 (IQR 18-27). patients being alive at 28 & 90 days and 12 months respectively. Adjusting for age and sex, APACHE II was the only factor associated with patient need for RRT at ICU discharge, 28 days, 90 days and 12 months (OR 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.15, p = 0.003; OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.16, p = 0.001; OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.001 and OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.001, respectively). After adjusting for age and sex, ad-Disease severity remains the main determinant of outcome in AKI patients receiving RRT on ICU. Despite the apparent relevance of KPS to outcomes on critical care, we could not in this instance show that KPS independently affected renal or patient survival.

In contrast, a PO4-containing dialysis fluid ensured normal PO4-levels in most pts. and significantly reduced the risk of severe hypoPO4.

Interestingly, when patient's PIF exceeded the flow delivered by each external source, oxygenation was lower, likely indicating higher discrepancy between externally set and alveolar FiO[sub]2[/ sub]'s(Fig. 48). Conclusions: HFNC improves oxygenation and reduces inspiratory drive and effort, thus decreasing the risk of respiratory decompensation.

The right ventricular function was not impaired, confirming that what is good for the lung may be not deleterious for the heart. Training for PICU was 30 hours and cost \u20ac620.

Conclusions: This evaluation has shown that switching to a new nitric oxide delivery system was cost effective (\u20ac9662) but the time (145.5 hours), effort and clinical risk involved was huge. A carefully considered implementation plan was essential for a safe and successful switchover. Mortality and morbidity is higher in ACLF compared to ALF. Prediction models developed in ACLF populations perform even better in ALF. This could be possibly explained by relatively few comorbidities in ALF.

We recorded the symptoms, physical signs, laboratory workup, management course and disposition of patients who came with envenomations by black widow spiders. Results A total of 8 subjects participated in the study. All of the patients were males with an age range of 25-58 years (median: 47 years). In all eight cases the black widow spider identification was made via a description of the spider. The time of onset of pain ranged from 30 minutes after the sting to 4 hours (median: 1 hour).Of the eight patients, three were asymptomatic , three had leg pain and two patients had abdominal pain. One patient had nausea and vomiting (12 %); the same patient had ptosis and sweating with neck rigidity and back pain (12 %).Upon examination, most of the symptomatic patients had redness over the sting location with no signs of compartment or swelling. Patients with abdominal pain had a rigid abdomen and guarding that mimicked an acute abdomen. blood test includes white blood count, kidney function test, coagulation profile, and creatine kinase. The results were normal in seven patients; only one patient developed acute kidney injury although his kidney function returned to normal upon discharge. In the treatment, all symptomatic patients received analgesia depending on the physician's discretion. Three patients received calcium gluconate intravenously and reported no improvement in their symptoms. In addition, all patients received tetanus toxoid vaccine. Four of the patients required admission (50 %), but they were all discharged with a mean hospital of stay of 3.75 days. Conclusions Envenomation by black widow is a complex syndrome that manifests itself in various ways and results in various outcomes. The syndrome is generally self-limited and antivenom treatment is rarely necessary. Patients with significant pain that does not improve should be ad-mitted for observation and possible treatment with antivenom. Mechanical ventilation in patients with overdose not yet intubated on icu admission A. E Van den Berg 1 , Y. Schriel 2 , L. Dawson 2 , I. A. Meynaar 1IntroductionPatients with an overdose or intoxication are admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic or respiratory monitoring. It was our impression that many patients who are monitored do not need interventions. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of mechanical ventilation within 24 hours after ICU admission in intoxicated patients who were not already ventilated on admission to the ICU.MethodsThe study was done in ICUs of the Reinier de Graaf Hospital in Delft and the HagaHospital in the Hague, both in the Netherlands. The study is a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted to either ICU between 2010 and 2014 with a diagnosis of intoxication or overdose who were not mechanically ventilated or intubated on admission. The need for ethical approval was waived by the local ethical committee. All patient data are collected regularly in the databases of both units for administrative and quality improvement purposes. The study endpoint was mechanical ventilation within the first 24 hours after ICU admission.ResultsDuring the study period a total of 403 patients were admitted with an overdose or intoxication. Of these 403 patients, 91 patients were excluded since they were intubated and ventilated on admission. Characteristics of the study population of 312 patients are presented in theTable. Our results show that only a small minority of patients (18/312 = 5.8 %) admitted with intoxication or overdose that are not ventilated on ICU admission develop the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in the next 24 hours. A quarter of patients admitted with a GCS < 8 was subsequently intubated and ventilated in the first 24 hrs, whereas only 2.6 % of patients admitted with a GCS > =8 needed tracheal intubation and ventilation in the first 24 hrs after ICU admission. Our study shows that the GCS on admission is a significant predictor for the need of mechanical ventilation. Central nervous system depressants poisoning and ventilator associated pneumonia: an underrated risk factor in toxicological intensive care unit H. Talaie Toxicological Research Center, Department of Clinical Toxicology, Loghman-Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P360 IntroductionThe objective of the present survey was to identify the ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) risk and prognostic factors among poisoned patients, who admitted to Toxicological ICU (TICU), especially in CNS depressants due to its prevalence and importance. VAP is a main cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs) which causes high mortality and morbidity. Methods A case-control study was conducted at Loghman Hakim Hospital between March 2013 and March 2014. Among 300 poisoned patients with mechanical ventilator > =48 hours, 150 patients who developed microbiologically-confirmed VAP were considered as VAP group and 150 without VAP were defined as control group. The data were collected by age, sex, type of poisoning, GCS, APACHE II score, length of hospital stay, previous antibiotic use, microbial culture of the trachea, body temperature, leukocyte count, and patients' outcome. Based on the type of poisoning, patients were divided in 3 groups that included opioid (opium, heroin and methadone), CNS depressants (Antidepressant, Benzodiazepine and anti-convulsive) and other such as pesticide, methanol, 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and multi drugs. All data were expressed as mean (SD) for continuous variable and frequency for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between risk factors and VAP.ResultsMean age of the patients was 33.9 \u00b1 14.3 years. The probable VAP incidence and mortality were 22 % and 18.6 %, respectively. CNS depressant versus opioid (odds ratio, 3.74; p < .027), APACHE II (odds ratio, 1.28; p < .000) and Hospital length of stay (odds ratio, 2.15; p < .000) were the independent risk factor for VAP. While, APACHE II score (odds ratio, 1.12; p < .044) and Hospital length of stay (odds ratio, 2.15; p < .000) were the independent predictors of VAP mortality among these patients. The most common microorganisms in VAP cases were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Acinetobacter sp in order to 56.7 % and 12.7. Conclusions CNS depressant was an important risk factor for VAP among poisoned patients. Hypoventilation due to CNS depression can lead to VAP. APACHE II and Hospital length of stay were shown as independent predictors of VAP and mortality among these patients. It seems that patients' short turn over and hospitalization would be resulted in patients' outcome.",

However, recent studies found increased sedation delivery can adversely affect MV patient outcomes. A retrospective audit of length of MV (LoMV) and sedation delivery in the Christchurch Hospital ICU over 3 calendar years (2012-2014) was carried out. Methods Data on sedative drug (Dexmedetomidine, Fentanyl and Propofol) usage and LoMV were collected from hospital records. Total sedative drug use and LoMV were assessed monthly and compared between years using a Wilcoxon Ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis test. Zero-lag cross correlations were used to assess the relationship between month-to-month trends in LoMV and sedation use. A Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to assess the impact of potential outlier months on the results (4 of 36 months were removed without replacement and the analysis repeated 10,000 times). Standardised Mortality Rate (SMR) was calculated each year to account for changes in cohort.ResultsIn 2012, the median [Interquartile range (IQR)] of LoMV hours was 92 [IQR: 77-101] while 2013 was 86 [IQR: 75-103] and 2014 was 107 [IQR: 80-121]. The median LoMV per patient for 2013 and 2014 were significantly higher than 2012 (p < 0.05) (92 and 107 hours vs 86 hours). Median [IQR] for total sedative drug usage was 13 [IQR: 12-16] mg/ hour LoMV in 2012, 15 [IQR: 13-18] in 2013 and 16 [IQR: 14-18] 2014.Usage in 2013 and 2014 were significantly higher than 2012 (p < 0.05). The zero-lag cross-correlation between LoMV and sedation usage per month over the 3 years was 0.76 indicating that these rising trends are well mirrored, as additionally shown inFig. 92. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the trend of increasing sedation usage associated with increasing LoMV is robust, with 98 % of the simulation indicating an increasing trend. Over the study period, the SMR was 0.71 (2012), 0.58 (2013) and 0.61 (2014) for MV patients suggesting that increased LoMV was not due to a significantly more ill MV cohort.",

Ventilator (NPB 840) was set to V-AC, 450 mL and 16 BPM. Two sevoflurane concentrations (5 mL/h and 8 mL/h) and three FiO2 (air, 50 % and 100 % oxygen) were tested against constant NO flow (20 ppm).ResultsAt constant V-AC ventilation and constant NO flow, inspiratory concentration NO readings showed minimal (NS) variations during different FiO2 or sevoflurane concentration administered. Similarly, administering constant NO and 2 different sevoflurane concentration did not affect sevoflurane concentration readings. Conclusions Co-administration of NO and sevoflurane via Anaconda does not affect gas analysis and can be safely used as a sedation and ARDS salvage therapy. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) may spare other sedative use, reduce delirium incidence, facilitate earlier extubation, and thereby prevent the need for a tracheostomy as well as reduce hospital expenses. There is however a paucity of data in patients with cancer. We sought to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the drug in this setting. Methods A retrospective review of electronic records between February 2014 and March 2015 was conducted. Sedative use, ventilator weaning, extubation rates and tracheostomy requirement were assessed. In addition, a cost-analysis per patient was determined.ResultsTwenty-nine patients (19 male) received DEX in the study period (age range 19-82 years). The median length of stay was 19.6 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13.0-26.3) as a result of prolonged mechanical ventilation (median 15.8 days (IQR 8.0-23.0). Nineteen patients survived to ICU discharge. Eighteen patients (61.1 %) required a tracheostomy, with a median duration of 18 days (IQR 10.5-19.77). DEX was used to facilitate sedation reduction in those patients who were difficult to wean, manage agitation and delirium and to expedite extubation/decannulation. It was utilised for a median of 79 hours (IQR 144-47) with a median dose of 0.91 micrograms/kg/hr (IQR 0.57-1.13). It was deemed to have improved the defined outcomes for 12 patients (41 %). Bradycardia and/or hypotension was observed in 17 patients within 4-hr of DEX treatment, almost half required support. The mean cost of DEX treatment was \u00a3630 per patient. This approximates to \u00a31500 per patient with clinical benefit. This cost was offset by the reduction of sedation (11 patients) in those patients with difficult to manage agitation with other agents, as well as ventilator weaning, earlier extubation and avoidance of tracheostomy (10 patients).",

A Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated for each patient using an ICD-10 specific algorithm. The main outcome, prolonged LOS, was defined as an LOS greater than or equal to the 75th percentile. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with prolonged length of stay. Results: With multivariate logistic regression, patients with prolonged LOS were characterised by renal disease (OR 5.Analysing the univariate relationship between each factor and LOS additionally identified the presence of anaemia, malignancy, low albumin and high CCI as significantly associated with a prolonged stay, but these were not validated as significant at the multivariate stage. Age, chronic pulmonary disease and heart failure were not found to be significantly associated with an increased LOS in our cohort. Conclusions: Prolonged LOS is significantly associated with several measurable patient characteristics. Further work would be required to more accurately characterise risk factors, but validation of similar risk factors could facilitate prospective bed booking in a dedicated post anaesthetic care unit, with those patients who have risk factors for prolonged LOS instead being admitted directly to the general ICU post-operatively.P382 Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and hospital mortality prediction in a brazilian cohort of critically ill patients L. U. Taniguchi, E. M. Siqueira, J. M. Vieira Jr, L. C. Azevedo Research and Education Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P382Introduction: Introduction: Criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) are frequently used to identify patients at higher risk of death. However, the utility of SIRS has recently been questioned. The objective of this study was to evaluate if SIRS criteria might predict hospital mortality in a Brazilian cohort of critically ill patients. Methods: Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a private tertiary hospital (Hospital Sirio-Libanes) at S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We extracted relevant information from the adult intensive care unit database (sistema Epimed\u2122). A comparison was performed between SAPS 3 score model and SIRS model both as a dichotomous variable (> = 2 criteria -\"SIRS positive\" versus 0-1 criterion -\"SIRS negative\") and as an ordinal variable from 0 to 4 (according to the number of SIRS criteria met) for predicting hospital mortality. Models discriminations were compared using area under the ROC curves. Results: Results: Between January to December 2012, we studied 932 patients (60.4 % were classified as \"SIRS positive\"). Patients \"SIRS positive\" were more severily ill compared to patients \"SIRS negative\"Conclusions: Conclusion: The utility of SIRS criteria to recognize severity of illness and predict mortality in our cohort could not be observed.P383Evaluating the efficacy of a risk predictor panel in identifying patients at elevated risk of morbidity following emergencyadmission A. N. Ahmad, M. Abu-Habsa, R. Bahl, E. Helme, S. Hadfield, R. Loveridge King's College Hospital, London, UK Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P383Introduction: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pre-defined clinical and biochemical criteria in predicting deterioration following hospital admission via the Emergency Department (ED), and to evaluate their utility as triggers for involvement of the iMobile Critical Care Outreach service within the hospital. Methods: 113 patients were randomly selected from King's College Hospital emergency admissions. Notes were screened for the presence of: a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) > =5 or respiratory rate > =24 at transfer from the ED to the ward, sepsis with hypotension at any point, new acute kidney injury (AKI), lactate > =4 or metabolic acidosis on blood gas analysis and need for high flow oxygen at transfer from the ED to the ward. Primary outcome measures were mortality, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and length of stay. Associations between proposed criteria and patient outcomes were statistically evaluated. Results: Results calculated based on 14-day outcome data suggest that likelihood of ICU admission is significantly increased by NEWS > =5 (chisquared = 5.029, p = 0.025), new AKI (chi-squared = 9.099, p = 0.003) and need for high flow oxygen at transfer (chi-squared = 16.634, p < 0.0001). Patient mortality was significantly increased by NEWS > =5 (chi-squared = 6.391, p = 0.011), respiratory rate > =24 (chi-squared = 5.417, p = 0.020), need for high flow oxygen at transfer (chi-squared = 19.394, p < 0.00001), detection of metabolic acidosis on blood gas analysis (chi-squared = 4.764, p = 0.030) and new AKI (chi-squared = 5.056, p = 0.025). Additionally, new AKI significantly increases length of stay (+5.785 days, p = 0.003). Patients will be followed up for a period of 3 months and current preliminary results will be reassessed with 3month outcome data in this ongoing study. Conclusions: NEWS > =5, new AKI, elevated respiratory rate, metabolic acidosis and a high inspired oxygen fraction requirement are significant predictors of inpatient stay morbidity and could potentially be used as triggers for early Critical Care input.

Shak, C. Senver, R. Howard-Griffin Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, England, UK, Ipswich, UK Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P384 Introduction: In 2014, admissions following elective surgery occupied 26 % of admissions to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) at Ipswich Hospital. A retrospective study showed 75 % of these admissions did not result in Level 2 or 3 intervention.Depending on CCU bed pressures, patients booked for elective postoperative admission are assessed in the recovery room for suitability to return to a general ward. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of all patients who were identified as high risk, thus being booked for post-operative CCU admission, thereby identifying those who do benefit from CCU admission and those safe for care on the ward. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all CCU bed requests was undertaken between November 2013 -April 2014. Patient demographics, comorbidities, nature of surgery and post-operative progress were recorded. A comparison was made between those admitted to CCU and those returning to a general ward. Results: Of 149 CCU bed requests made, 100 cases were admitted to CCU, 49 cases returned to the ward following anaesthetist or intensivist assessment. There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (mean 72.9 vs 75.6 years, p = 0.16). There was no significant difference in comorbid state, quantified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (mean score 2.55 vs 2.31, p = 0.24). Of all surgical specialities, colorectal patients were most likely to be admitted to CCU. Overall length of stay was significantly longer in those admitted to CCU compared to ward, (mean 11 vs 5 days, p = 0.00006). There were also more post-operative complications; 64 events in 42 patients vs 12 events in 11 patients. 6 of 100 patients admitted to CCU required subsequent readmission. 1 of 49 patients returned to the ward was admitted to CCU day 1 post-operatively. Thus, only 26 of 149 CCU bed requests resulted in admission with Level 2 or 3 interventions.Conclusions: This study suggests that patient demographics and comorbid state have little influence on the eventual post-operative care pathway in this patient cohort. Rather, an objective assessment in the recovery room effectively identified patients with a shorter length of stay and fewer post-operative complications.",

Sbiti-Rohr, P. Schuetz Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P386Introduction: Clinical scores such as pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 are recommended for risk assessment in communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigated the prognostic potential of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) in a large and well defined cohort of CAP patients with a 6 years follow-up. Methods: We prospectively followed 925 CAP patients from a previous Swiss multicentre trial. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 6 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were adverse clinical outcome defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, complications (empyema) and unplanned hospital readmission all within 30 days. We used logistic regression models and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) to compare NEWS with PSI and CURB-65. Results: Six-year overall mortality was 45.1 % (n = 417) with a stepwise increase with higher NEWS categories. For 30-days and 6-year mortality prediction, NEWS showed only moderate discrimination (AUC 0.65 and 0.60) inferior compared to PSI and CURB-65. For prediction of ICU admission, NEWS showed high discrimination (AUC 0.73) and improved the prognostic accuracy of PSI (AUC from 0.66 to 0.74, p = 0.001) and CURB-65 (AUC from 0.64 to 0.73, p = 0.015). NEWS was also superior to PSI and CURB-65 for prediction of complications, but did not well predict rehospitalisation. Conclusions: NEWS provides additional prognostic information in regard to risk of ICU admission and complications thereby improves traditional clinical risk scores in the management of CAP patients in the emergency department setting.P387 Clinical usefulness of the charlson\u00a1\u00afs weighted index of comorbidities _as prognostic factor in patients with prolonged acute mechanical ventilation H.

P388 Comparison of mortality prediction scoring systems in patients with cirrhosis admitted to general intensive care unit M. Cooper 1 , K. Milinis 2 , G. Williams 2 , E. McCarron 1 , S. Simants 1 , I. Patanwala 1 , I. D. Welters 2Introduction: Mortality of patients with cirrhosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported to be as high as 60 %. Recently, a number of scoring systems have been developed in order to predict mortality in tertiary liver units, including CLIF-SOFA-based scoring systems and Royal Free Hospital (RFH) tool, however, none of them has been validated in patients admitted to general ICU[1]. The aim of the study is to validate the new measures and compare with established prediction models. Methods: Data on patients with confirmed cirrhosis admitted to a general ICU at a major university hospital between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively collected from medical records. Scores were calculated for CLIF-Consortium Organ Failure score (CLIF-C OF, a shortened version of CLIF-SOFA), CLIF-C ACLF (includes age and white cell count), RFH, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II). The main outcome was mortality in ICU. Predictive accuracy and calibration was assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and goodness-of-fit \u03c7 statistic. Results: 118 patients were identified (mean age 50.6 years, 66.9 % male). ICU mortality was 54.2 %. Alcoholic liver disease was the main aetiological factor present in 91.5 % of the patients. 56 % of patients were admitted to ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding. All measures were well calibrated (\u03c7 >0.2, p > 0.05), particularly CLIF-OF (\u03c7 =1.3, p = 0.93). Accuracy of the novel models was generally not superior to the established scores (AUROC values: CLIF-OF 0.68; CLIF-ACLF 0.68; RFH 0.72 vs. APACHEII 0.65; MELD 0.71). Bilirubin, creatinine and platelets were found to be independent predictors of mortality in a multivariate logistic model. The accuracy of creatinine alone was higher than any of the prediction models (AUROC 0.85, \u03c7 =8.4, p = 0.35). Conclusions: RHF and MELD scores have the best predictive accuracy. However, complex and specialised measures do not offer advantage in predicting mortality over MELD and routinely available APACHEII score in cirrhotic patients admitted to general ICU. Creatinine alone is a robust prognostic indicator of mortality. Simplified scores encompassing few variables may offer similar accuracy, but higher utility. 24 hours of resuscitation accurately predicted both the need for ICU admission and survival.P391 The incidence and outcome of hyperlactatemia in the post anaesthesia care unit T. Abe, S. Uchino, M. Takinami The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P391Introduction: Critically ill patients often develop hyperlactatemia, and elevated serum lactate levels are associated with increased hospital mortality. However, the epidemiology of hyperlactatemia in patients admitted to the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) has never been studied previously.Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the PACU of a university hospital in Tokyo, Japan from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. Adult PACU patients who were monitored with the arterial catheter after elective surgery were included, except for patients with no lactate measured within 3 hours after PACU admission. We measured serum lactate levels in arterial blood samples using a point-of-care device. Study patients were divided to three groups according to maximum lactate levels in the first 24 hours of the PACU stay; normal lactate (<2 mmol/L), moderate hyperlactatemia (2-3.9 mmol/L) and severe hyperlactatemia (> = 4 mmol/L). The primary outcome was the composite outcome consisted of in-hospital mortality, re-admission to the PACU or admission to the ICU, and emergency reoperation during the same hospital stay.Results: A total of 5362 patients were included in the study. Among these patients, 3421 (63.8 %) patients had normal lactate, 1642 (30.6 %) had moderate and 299 (5.6 %) had severe hyperlactatemia. The composite outcome occurred in 333 (6.2 %) of all patients. The incidence rate of the composite outcome increased as serum lactate levels elevated (normal: 4.7 %, moderate: 7.9 %, severe: 14.1 %, normal vs. moderate: [i]p[/i] <0.001, moderate vs. severe: [i]p[/i] <0.001).Inhospital mortality, re-admission to the PACU or admission to the ICU, and emergency reoperation occurred in 71 (1.3 %), 190 (3.5 %), and 168 (3.1 %) for all patients, respectively. Each primary outcome tended to increase with elevated serum lactate levels. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that moderate and severe hyperlactatemia were risk factors for the composite outcome, odds ratio: 1.56 (1.20 -2.01) for moderate hyperlactatemia, 1.57 (1.01 -2.43) for severe hyperlactatemia referred to normal lactate. Conclusions: The incidence of hyperlactatemia in the PACU was 36.2 % after elective surgery. Although hyperlactatemia was independently associated with poor outcome, severe hyperlactatemia was only similarly associated with poor outcome compared with moderate hyperlactatemia. Further studies, especially for causes of hyperlactatemia in the PACU, will be clarified.P392 Correlation between arterial blood gas disturbances and arterial lactate levels during hospitalization and outcome in critically septic patients N. R. Rangel Neto, S. Oliveira, F. Q. Reis, F. A. Rocha Albert Schweitzer State Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P392Introduction: Severe sepsis is a life-threatening multisystem process that can result in significant morbidity or mortality. In most patients, severe sepsis and shock septic is preceded by a period of physiological deterioration; but evidence suggests that the early signs of this are frequently missed. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is indispensable tool to assess and monitor critically ill patients in the ICU or other critical care settings. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the medical data of all critically septic patients admitted to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital were reviewed between January 2013 and September 2015. Data including age, gender, SAPS III score upon admission, SOFA score, arrival and 24 hour ABG and arterial lactate levels, as well as length of stay and in-hospital mortality rate were collected. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between acid-base disturbance and lactate levels with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results: Of the 2974 patients, 54 % were male; mean age of 62 years old, mean SAPS III score of 63 points, SOFA score of 9 and 37,9 % of them died in the hospital. Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients who developed metabolic acidosis plus hyperlactatemia (OR = 2,98, p-value 0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis (OR = 3.19, 95 % CI = 1.The results show that in critically septic patients initial metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia are significant predictors of mortality, reinforcing the significance of early action to restore tissue perfusion and minimizing damage.P393 External validation of saps 3 and mpm iii scores in 48,816 patients from 72 brazilian icus G.

Effects of icu weekend admission and discharge on mortality.E. Moreira, F. Verga, M. Barbato, G. Burghi Hospital Maciel, Montevideo, Uruguay Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P397Introduction: Mortality is one of the most used outcome indicator among critical care patients. It depends on several variables like comorbidities, reason for admission and severity of the disease. Less attention has been directed to how the timing of admission and discharge from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) may influence hospital mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the impact on ICU and hospital mortality of the moment of admission to and discharge from the Intensive Care Unit. Methods: To this end we developed a prospective observational study, which included patients admitted between April and November 2014 in the ICU of the Maciel Hospital of Montevideo-Uruguay. We consider weekdays between monday to thursday, and weekend friday to sunday. Nocturnal admission was defined between 8:00 PM to 7:59 AM. Results: We analyzed 325 patients with a median age of 55 (36-71) years and SAPS II of 43 (29-58) value points. No differences in mortality in ICU were found when comparing the time of admission (35 % on weekends vs 31 % on weekdays, p = ns) nor the time of entry (nocturnal 35 % vs diurnal 31 % , p = ns). The discharge day was associated with higher hospital mortality (57 % in the weekend vs. 14 % on weekdays, p = 0.000).Factors associated with hospital mortality by uni variate analisys were: age less than 50 years (43 % vs 17 %; Factors independently associated with hospital mortality after discharge from the ICU were patients older than 50 years (OR 2.4; 95 % CI, 1.1 to 5.4) and discharge during the weekend (OR 7.7 95 % CI, 3.8 to 15.6).Conclusions: This study shows that the moment of discharge was independently associated with hospital mortality.P398 Organizational factors, outcomes and resource use in 9,946 cancer patients admitted to 70 ICUs M Soares 1 , U.

ICUs (51 located in general hospitals and 19 in cancer centers) during 2013. We retrieved clinical and outcome data from an electronic ICU quality registry (Epimed Monitor System). We surveyed ICUs regarding hospital and ICU structure, organization, staffing patterns and process of care. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify characteristics associated with hospital mortality. We evaluated efficiency in resource use using standardized mortality rates (SMR) and resource use (SRU) based on the SAPS 3 score. Results: ICUs were mostly medical or medical-surgical (n = 60, 86 %) and located in private hospitals (n = 66, 94 %). Median number of cancer patients per center was 110 (IQR 58-154), corresponding to 16 % (9 %-25%) of all ICU admissions. Median SAPS 3 score was 47 (36-59) points; mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 21 % of the patients. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 15.9 % and 25.4 %, respectively.

Raithatha 1 Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK; 2 Whiston Hospital, St Helens & Knowsley, UK Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P400 Introduction: Palliative oncology patients are admitted to critical care not uncommonly, outcomes are variable and often difficult to predict. We sought to observe Intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital outcomes of palliative oncology patients, in relation to demographic, disease and organ failure criteria. Methods: Retrospective review of the electronic database and notes of patients admitted to ICU between January 2012 and October 2014 was undertaken. Patients without a formal palliative diagnosis or with a diagnosis of haematological malignancy, were excluded. Demographics, functional status, current cancer treatment, interventions received, and palliative care team involvement were amongst parameters collected. SAPS II, APACHE II scores and ICU outcome were recorded. STATA 14.1 was used for Logistic regression analyses. Results: 31 patients were identified, median (IQR) age was 68 (62-76) years, 14 (45.2 %) were male, median (IQR) SAPS II score was 56 (53-71). Of 28 patients, where information was available, 18 (64.3 %) had metastatic disease; 16 (61.5 %) were undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 5 (19.2 %) palliative surgical intervention. Median (IQR) LOS was 3.25 (1.3-5.1) days and 6 (19.4 %) patients had died at CC discharge. Hospital mortality was 29.6 %. Median survival was 7 days in hospital patients and 143 days in patients discharged home. At logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, the only factor associated with mortality at ICU discharge was SAPS II score (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8-1, p = 0.046), while length of stay (LOS), type of palliative treatment received prior to ICU admission, metastatic spread, neutropenia, smoking and diabetic status and highest recorded lactate in the 24 hours prior to ICU admission seemed to not be associated with ICU outcome. The lack of statistical significance for these correlations may be related to the small sample size. Conclusions: A high SAPS II score may confer accurate prognostic information in the context of critically unwell palliative cancer patients. Overall ICU mortality was lower than those documented by previous works (47-70 %), [1][2][3] this may be related to strict triage by both the ICU and oncology teams. Median survival of palliative oncology patients admitted to critical care remains poor.

Our study evaluated the clinical utility of Charlson\u00a1\u00afs weighted index of comorbities (WIC) as a prognostic factor in patients with prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV, ventilator care \u00a1\u00c3 96 hrs). Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 311 PAMV patients who were admitted to the mechanical intensive care unit (ICU) of Pusan National University Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Survivors were defined as patients who survived for 28 days after their ICU admission. Results: The median age of the subjects was 67 years (range: 18-93), and 71.7 % of them were male. The median lengths of their stay in the ICU and the hospital were 15 (range: 4-129) and 26 (range: 5-430) days, respectively. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 43.7 and 44.4 %, respectively, and the 28-day mortality rate after the ICU admission was 34.7 %. The median WIC was 2 (range: 0-11), and there was a significant difference in the WICs of the non-survivors and survivors (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between the WIC and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores on the admission day (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristics curve indicated a WIC of 3 as the cut-off value [area under the curve, 0.593; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.525-0.661; and p < 0.05], and the subjects with a WIC greater than 3 had a higher mortality rate (44.5 % vs. 28.6 %, p < 0.05). The univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a WIC \u00a1\u00c3 3 was independently associated with 28-day mortality in our population (odds ratio, 2.0; 95 % CI, 1.240-3.226; and p < 0.05). We excluded patients who underwent cardiac surgeries or invasive cardiac procedures, readmissions, and those admitted for acute coronary syndromes and burns. We retrieved clinical and outcome data from an electronic ICU quality registry (Epimed Monitor System), including the estimates for the MPM-III and SAPS 3 scores. For the SAPS 3 score, we estimated predicted mortality using both standard (SE) and Latin-American (LA) customized equations. We evaluated models' discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We applied the calibration belt to evaluate the agreement between observed and expected mortality rates (calibration). We also calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for each model. Introduction: The brazilian population is ageing and this is affecting trends in the percentage of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions attributable to patients aged 80 years or older, the very elderly. In 2050 the population elderly will be a quarter of the total population. Advanced age is associated with increased severity of acute critical illnesses and admission to ICU. They have a high risk of death. Methods: We evaluated age-specific 2329 subjects > = 15y old and retrospectively admitted to the ICU from Jan 2014 to Oct 2015. We analyzed the clinical data of the subjects and divided into two groups: less than 80 (L80) and greater than or equal to 80 years (G80). We evaluated the major clinical outcomes and compared the two groups. Results: We had 56.2 % male. The average length of stay in ICU (L80 = 6.5d \u00b1 10.2; G80 = 8.2 \u00b1 10.5) and hospital (L80 = 18.7 \u00b1 35.9; G80 = 23.0 \u00b1 28.7) showed no significant difference between the two groups. Mean SAPS 3 was 41.2 \u00b1 13.3, with differences between the L80 group (38.8 \u00b1 12.5) and G80 (53.0 \u00b1 10.8) as well as the probability of death L80 = 9.8 % \u00b1 13.6 and G80 = 24.8 % \u00b1 17.3, respectively. As might be expected mortality, both in ICU or hospital were higher in the older group with significance according to the Z test for two proportions. Conclusions: Age did not affect the length stay in ICU and hospital. The elderly subjects (> = 80y) admitted to the ICU had a higher mortality rate compared with subjects of other ages. These findings raise questions about the use of critical care at the end of life for the very elderly. Conclusions: We found that MODS were the main mode of death, following by BD and DL. Pts dying of MODS were more likely to be younger and suffer from co-morbidities. As the majority of pts died from MODS were under inadequate treatment, and the results arrived quite late, we could speculate that timely processing and handling of blood culture results, and better antibiotic coverage could lead to better infection control and less progress to MODS and death.",

Continuous data were reported as medians and percentage. Chisquare and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare data of patients with favorable outcomes and those with unfavorable outcomes. Results TH was applied in 51 comatose survivors, including 40 survivors (78.4 %) from out-of-hospital arrest. The primary cardiac rhythm for the majority (40/51, 78.4 %) was non-shockable rhythm.

The aim of our study was to investigate if dexmedetomidine can be used effectively and safely as a sedative agent in a porcine model of septic shock. Methods 32 pigs under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation were included in this study and were randomly assigned into one of the 4study groups (G-A, G-B, G-C, G-D-each group consisted of 8 animals). All pigs received continuous infusion of propofol and rocuronium. In G-A, no other intervention was performed, in G-B dexmedetomidine was administered in a dose of 0.8mcg/kg/hr, in G-C sepsis was induced by intravenous administration of LPS and in G-D both dexmedetomidine infusion and sepsis induction were performed in a similar manner like in G-B and G-C respectively. Study parameters included heart rate-HR, mean systemic-mSAP and pulmonary artery blood pressure-mPAP, central venous pressure-CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure-PAOP. Parameters were recorded at baseline (phase-P0) and every 30 min for 3 hrs (P1-6). For the statistical analysis, repeated measures ANOVA was used (SPSS21). Results HR, mSAP and mPAP values are depicted on the following Table. CVP and PAOP did not show any significant alterations. Conclusions According to our study results, dexmedetomidine has positive effects both on HR and on sepsis induced pulmonary hypertension. The decrease of mSAP was similar in all study animals, both in the septic and the non-septic ones.Conclusions: In a contemporary large cohort, the SAPS 3 SE was accurate in predicting outcomes for Brazilian patients.",

Kang Stamford Hospital, Stamford, USA Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P394 Introduction: While previous studies have assessed the relationship of preadmission functional status (FS) to mortality in critically ill patients, none has assessed the impact of FS on the results of mortality prediction models (MPM). We hypothesized that FS would confound predictions of severity adjusted mortality. Methods: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data, and includes all 10,149 patients admitted to the 16 bed intensive care unit of our university-affiliated hospital between 10/1/05 and 9/30/15. We abstracted information from the ICU's database, including diagnoses, APACHE II scores (APII), APACHE IV predictions of mortality (APIVM) and hospital discharge status. We prospectively characterized patients as FS1 (fully independent, n = 8,146), FS2 (partly dependent, living at home, n = 1,026) and FS3 (not living at home, n = 977). We stratified by severity of illness, compared observed:expected mortality ratios (O:E) and created a multivariable model to assess the independent effect of FS on mortality. Results: FS1 were younger than FS2 and FS3, were more likely to be admitted to the ICU after surgery and had lower APII, APIVM and mortality than did FS2 or FS3 (p < 0.0001 all comparisons). The impact of FS on confounding predictions of mortality was inversely related to severity of illness: O:E mortality ratios, based on hospital discharge status and APIVM and stratified by severity of illness for FS1, FS2, FS3: APIVM <10 % -0.33, 0.72, 1.02 APIVM 10-25 % -0.49, 1.03, 0.88 APIVM 25-50 % -0.60, 0.76, 0.98 APIVM >50 % -0.87, 0.93, 0.94 Multivariable analysis demonstrated that FS2 and FS3 were independently associated with increased risk of mortality when compared to FS1: OR (95 % CI) 1.93 (1.57-2.37) and 2.29 (1.87-2.79), respectively, (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Conclusions: Preadmission functional status is independently associated with risk of mortality in critically ill patients and confounds the results of mortality prediction models, especially in patients with less severe illness. Future mortality prediction models should incorporate functional status in their design.",

Methods: Wardwatcher\u00a9 provided mortality and readmission data of patients discharged from two district hospital ITU's in a year. Discharges were split into night, weekday and weekend. Chi squared was used to calculate the significance of mortality data. Rate of delayed discharge (>240 minutes) and reason for delay were recorded. Results: In hospital 1, 15 % were night discharges. 65 % weekday and 20 % weekend. Night discharge mortality was 9 %, 8 % weekday and 7 % weekends. 84 % of weekend discharges were delayed, 77 % at night and 70 % during the week. In hospital 2 6.7 % were night discharges. 74 % weekdays and 19 % weekends. Night discharge mortality was 18 %, 9 % on weekdays and 8 % at weekends. 68 % of daytime discharges were delayed, 53 % at weekends and 62 % at night. The combined mortality data (Table 49 ) has a p value of 0.089, using Chi-squared. In all groups >50 % of discharges were delayed over four hours. Across both sites, >80 % of delays were due to a lack of ward beds. Readmission rates were <5 %. Conclusions: An increase in mortality for night discharges was noted. Hospital 1 had a higher rate of night discharges and a higher rate of delayed discharges. Hospital 2 has a lower rate of both. Possibly demonstrating that prompt discharge of patients leads to fewer night discharges. With the increase in mortality in those discharged at night, it highlights the importance of avoiding delayed discharges. Although a causal relationship between delayed discharge, night discharge and mortality cannot be proved; this data adds to the evidence. Demonstrating a higher mortality associated with night discharges and that delaying discharges contributes to a higher rate of night discharges. More research is required to explore this. Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of musculoskeletal problems (i.e. pain, weakness, decreased joint range of movement) in critical care patients post discharge. Post intensive care syndrome (PICS) is now a widely used term to describe the collection of problems patients develop due to their stay in intensive care. ICU survivors have been found to have a high risk of developing not only psychological problems but physical problems such as Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness (ICUAW) and chronic pain [1, 2] . Methods: Discharged patients from ICU attended a 5 week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme as part of a quality improvement initiative within Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU. Participants completed a one-one musculoskeletal assessment with an ICU physiotherapist. Ethics approval was waived as the programme was part of a quality improvement initiative. Results: Data was collected from 47 of the 48 patients who attended the programme (median age was 52 (IQR, 44-57), 67% of the patients were men, median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 15 days (IQR 9-25) and median APACHE II was 23 (IQR 18-27). 66% of participants (n = 47) reported a new incidence of pain since discharge from ICU, 28% reporting lower limb (LL) pain and 25% reporting shoulder pain. Bilateral symptoms were reported in 84% of those who complained of lower limb pain in contrast to 25% of those with shoulder pain. In relation to muscle weakness, 74% of participants presented with LL weakness compared with 51% in the upper limb (UL). UL joint range of movement was reduced in 40% of participants and a 19% reduction for the LL. 23% of all participants reported numbness in UL/LL or both. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal problems especially shoulder pain and bilateral LL pain and weakness remain a significant problem for survivors of critical illness. This may have implications regarding falls risks, exercise capacity and reduce the likelihood of patients returning to work. Shoulder pain was found to be one of the most common complaints of pain supporting other research [1] with contributing factors such as the position of ventilator tubing, dialysis lines or central lines hypothesised. Collecting this data has helped raise awareness of these problems and may strengthen the case for more equipment for active mobilisation in ICU and herald a need for increased understanding in downstream wards on ICUAW.",

Spronk Gelre Ziekenhuizen, Apeldoorn, Netherlands Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P420 Introduction: Light sedation has gained attention as part of standard daily care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Particularly early mobilization is associated with shorter time on the ventilator, shorter ICU length of stay and better survival. Interactive gaming may be a challenging way of engaging the patient in his own rehabilitation program. Few data are available for the use of these interactive games in the ICU envirnoment as part of daily routine physiotherapy, although one study showed that it was safe [1] . Methods: We developed a trolley with a Wii device that can be easily used when the patient is mobilized in a chair. In addition, we used the Mile\u2122 device with a bedcycle and hypothesized that this would be associated with increased motivation to use the bedcycle by our patients. Results: Patients liked to use the Wii device, particularly because a choice in games made it more interesting to use. Tennis, bowling and boxing were most frequently used. The use of the Wii was programmed in the daily mobilization schedule together with a physiotherapist, or just with the attending ICU nurse. The mile\u2122 bed-cycle device was used routinely since October 2015 with interesting results. Patients could choose the environment where they wanted to cycle around, e.g. \"slot Zeist\", in the woods or using a watercycle in the colourful village of Giethoorn. In parallel to the observation with the Wii device, patients liked the variety in scenes best. A study is in progress evaluating safety, as well as effects on motivation of patients using these interactive games in the ICU. Conclusions: The use of interactive video games as part of routine rehabilitation programs in the ICU environment is feasible and appears safe in this short observation period. Interactive game therapy may complement existing rehabilitation techniques and increase motivation for ICU patients to be engaged in their own rehabilitation program.Introduction: Stopping rules instigate early clinical trial termination when interim analysis shows statistically significant effects of treatment as part of a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This study aims to develop a stopping rule based on observing a powered and significant difference in mortality across RCT arms in a study. Methods: The stopping rule was developed using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach with predetermined control group mortality rate (MC) and intervention group mortality rate (MI). This stopping rule is determined as the bias in mortality required to achieve a statistical significance of p < 0.05 with 80% power. Results: The stopping rule determined is as shown in the Fig. 104 . The y-axis is the mortality difference (MDiff) between MC and MI. Each line denotes a stopping rule for a different MC. For example, if MC is observed at 20% at sample size per arm of 100, the MDiff required to terminate the trials is 19%. Thus, the MI threshold for triggering the stopping rule is 39%. In practice, this means that if interim analysis of 100 patients per trial arm includes 20 deaths in the control group, the intervention group must observe 39 deaths or more to stop the trial (MI > = 39%). For MC = 30% at sample size per arm of 430 patients, the MDiff from the Figure is approximately 9%. This mortality difference is similar to the result found in the ARDSnet trial when comparing lower and traditional tidal volume ventilation [1] . The ARDSnet trial found a mortality difference of 31.0% versus 39.8% was significant whe\u00f1 430 patients per arm were recruited to the trial, and the early termination of the trial was triggered. This result further validates this stopping rule design method presented in this study.Conclusions: This stopping rule design method can be adapted for any two-arm RCT that monitors probabilistic and binary outcomes. This approach in designing a RCT stopping rule can be adjusted to the participating cohort using local data and based on the desired study characteristics, and fulfills ethical needs for a statistically justifiable stopping rule.",

Fayed Alexandria University Faculty of medicine, Alexandria, Egypt Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P425 Introduction: There has been an increase in the number and size of closed ICUs in Alexandria, Egypt that has not been met by a comparable increase in the number of intensivists. Consequently, leading to work overload and negative impact on both patients and intensivists. Methods: Using an in-person questionnaire of Consultants and Inhouse physicians in 27 closed ICUs in Alexandria, Egypt, obtaining information about their demographic data, patient workload, other hospital and medical duties and perception of the workplace and teaching environment. Results: 254 Physicians responded. The average daily (SD) census of patients was 7.96 \u00b1 6.24 patients, and the average (SD) maximum service size was 10.46 \u00b1 6.75 patients. The median of consultant/patient ratio was (1:8), which classified 8 ICUs into Unfavourable ratio ICUs (>1:8), and 19 ICUs into Favourable ratio ICUs (<1:8). The median of In-house physician/patient ratio was (1:4.5), which classified 16 ICUs into Unfavourable ratio units (>1:4.5), and 11 ICUs Favourable ratio units (<1:4.5). Respondents from Unfavourable ratio ICUs perceived significantly more time constraints, teaching difficulties, burnout, and negative impact on patients. Conclusions: Intensivists working in Unfavourable ratio ICUs frequently perceived being overburdened in comparison with those working in low ratio units. Also high physician/patient ratios may have a negative impact on teaching, patient care, and workforce stability. Introduction: Deterioration of patients in hospitals is typically preceded by changes in vital signs. Deterioration detection based on changes of a single vital sign can result in missed deterioration events and high false alarm rates. Multi-parameter systems such as the modified and national early warning system (MEWS and NEWS) use look up tables to score data from multiple vital signs and specify actions based on the score. These systems offer improved performance compared to single-parameter systems, but were created through physician consensus and may not be making optimal use of the available data. Here we explore use of modern data mining techniques to derive a high performance multi-parameter deterioration detection algorithm, the Early Deterioration Indicator (EDI). Methods: EDI was created by producing risk curves for every input feature. Every feature value is mapped to a risk score which are added together to get the final score. Input features for EDI were: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, temperature and age. To derive and validate EDI, we collected data from 14282 general ward stays. 11864 stays were used to develop the algorithm. We tested the algorithm on the other 2418 stays. EDI, MEWS and NEWS were calculated in the middle of general ward stay for non-deteriorating stays. For patients who deteriorated, middle values in the last 6 hours before deterioration were used to calculate the scores. We computed sensitivity, specificity values and the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operator characteristic curve for the 3 scores and compared their performance. Results: We tested the ability of EDI, MEWS and NEWS to predict deterioration which was defined as patient death or transfer to a higher level of care such as ICU. The training dataset comprised of 882 deteriorations (7.4% prevalence). In the training data, the AUC values were-EDI: 0.7793, NEWS: 0.6764, MEWS: 0.6404. The test dataset comprised of 184 deteriorations (7.6% prevalence). AUC values were-EDI: 0.7655, NEWS: 0.6569, MEWS: 0.6487. Conclusions: EDI was developed using a data-driven approach to discover patterns in vital sign values that are predictive of imminent patient deterioration. It is based on continuous-value risk curves that are sensitive to subtle variations in vital signs, and may be automated for real-time risk assessment. EDI significantly improves performance over commonly deployed systems (MEWS and NEWS) while making use of the same input parameters, offering the possibility of a drop-in solution to reduce alarm fatigue. Introduction: King's College Hospital is one of the largest acute and tertiary referral hospitals in the UK and plays a pivotal role in King's Health Partners, an AHSC. In 2013, the hospital set up a multi-disciplinary 24/7 enhanced critical care outreach service to support patients, relatives and staff providing: Rapid response & stabilisation; critical care follow-up; outreach education; and delivering virtual critical care beds when critical care flows exceed capacity. Methods: Process and hospital outcome data was collated by our business intelligence unit and the National Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA). Trends in hospital outcomes & cardiac arrests were analysed using linear regression and contingency tables. Results: The service saw 6046 patients in its first year which represented 12.2 % of the hospital admissions. The mean number of reviews per patient ranged from 3.25 for discharges to 13.5 for patients undergoing critical care interventions making 24,000 clinical episodes annually. The 'dose' was 82/1000 admissions, with only 8.8 % of calls inappropriate, and this exceeds the minimum dose recommended by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The median time to review after activation was 14 minutes. Hospital admissions and acuity rose during the study period by 11.2 % as measured by nationally set metrics and there was a reduction in the actual cardiac arrest rate as against the forecast cardiac arrest rate based on local historical NCAA data (P < 0.021). There was a significant difference in the trends for expected vs. observed deaths pre and post the introduction of the iMobile service (p < 0.043). Conclusions: High impact, high dose, critical care outreach services can deliver the changes in outcomes that are difficult to evaluate in healthcare socio-cultural interventions. Introduction: ICU bed scarcity is associated with reduced probability of ICU admission, but it is not clear if decisions to admit are subjected to heuristics and biases and to the impact of greater cognitive load. Methods: Physicians were electronically invited to respond an online questionnaire. The study was a factorial 2x2 trial and each respondent was randomized to increased or no increased cognitive load and to different versions of the vignettes. Cognitive load was simulated by distracting videos, sounds and time-limit for response. Clinical vignettes were based on real patients for whom ICU admission was requested. Archetypical vignettes for ICU admission or refusal were defined based on experts opinion. Six groups of vignettes were constructed: 1)single archetypical for admission; 2)two simultaneous archetypical for admission; 3)single archetypical for refusal; 4)two simultaneous archetypical for refusal; 5)single non-archetypical vignette. Each of these groups were randomly presented in an ICU scarcity (last bed available) or non-scarcity setting. Group 6 vignettes were randomly presented in two versions: 6.1 consisted in a \"multiple choice\" vignette in which the respondent was presented with the decision to admit an archetypical case for ICU admission or an elective surgery patient; 6.2 consisted in a \"status quo\" vignette, in which the last ICU bed was already reserved for an elective surgery patient and the respondent was presented with two simultaneous ICU requests for archetypical cases for ICU admission. Results: 159 physicians logged in and were randomized and 106 (67%) had complete data. Completion rate was lower for the cognitive load group (56% vs 79%, p < 0.05), but there were no differences on demographic characteristics. Cognitive load had no impact on the proportion of cases admitted or refused in each group. Group 3 vignettes were more often refused admission in ICU scarcity setting (68% vs 45%, p < 0.05). Archetypical vignettes for admission were more often refused in group 6.1 (multiple-choice) than group 6.2 (status quo): 20.4% vs 1.8%, p < 0.05. Conclusions: There was no impact of cognitive load on the responses, but the results may have been hampered by the differential dropout rate. ICU scarcity was associated with increased refusal of patients for whom ICU admission was deemed inappropriate, but not with refusal of patients for whom ICU admission was deemed appropriate. Multiplechoice bias had more impact than status quo bias in the inappropriate refusal of ICU admission.Introduction: Patients admitted through the emergency department (ED) to intensive care units (ICU) represent a unique population with varying etiologies of illness, for which existing descriptive analysis of severity and early prognosis of disease is lacking. Our study compares several ICU illness severity scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) within this cohort of patients during their early ED and ICU course to describe illness progression. Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted from the ED to the ICU in an academic referral center between January and February of 2014. Clinical and demographic data were collected to calculate APACHE II, SAPSII, SOFA scores on initial ED arrival (with exception of SAPSII), ED discharge, and after first 24 hours in the ICU. t-test used to evaluate differences between scores at each time interval, with p < 0.05 representing significance. Results: We enrolled 82 patients, who averaged 62 years of age, 53% were female. 43% were admitted to medical, 39% to surgical, 17% to neurologic ICUs. Mortality rate was 13%. SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II results summarized in Table 51 . Comparison of scores by t-test showed significant increase in illness severity between ED arrival and end of first 24 hours in ICU (Table 52) . Conclusions: Illness scores (SOFA, APACHEII, and SAPSII) significantly increased at 24 hours after ICU admission compared to ED arrival. While a preliminary investigation, our data provides insight on expected progression of illness for ICU-bound patients admitted from the ED. Further work is needed in elucidating prognostic indicators and patient-care factors. even after adjusting for age. These factors may support decision making by allowing objective quantification of functional reserve.Introduction: Demand for Critical Care (CC) is increasing but admission may be inappropriate if the patient is unlikely to survive. Consequently, published guidance may no longer reflect current practice [1] [2] . Clinical frailty evaluation scores have recently been shown to be associated with increased mortality in patients already admitted to CC [3] . We aimed to establish the impact of frailty and other factors on the decision whether to admit a deteriorating hospital patient to CC. Methods: Unplanned patient referrals were prospectively enrolled in a review cohort. Data included patient demographics, acute physiological parameters, prior hospital length of stay (LOS), Canadian Clinical Frailty Scale (CCFS) and comorbidities. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors influencing admission, using STATA 14.1.",

            "text": "Results: Between June and October 2015 data was collected on 220 patients referred to CC, of whom 87 (39.5%) were admitted. Median age was 66.5 (50-77) years, 134 (60.9%) were male and the median LOS prior to referral was 2 (0-7) days. The median SOFA score, CCFS and Charlson age-adjusted comorbidity index (CACI) was 5 (4-7), 4 (3-5) and 4 (2-6), respectively. At unadjusted logistic regression analysis age (p = 0.86), gender (p = 0.72), LOS (p = 0.34) and SOFA score (p = 0.42) did not impact on likelihood of admission to CC. Conversely, each unit increase in the CACI (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, p = 0.002) and in the CCFS (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85, p < 0.001) caused a decrease of approximately 22% and 31% in the odds of admission, respectively. On age and gender adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis CCFS retained its ability to predict admission to critical care (OR 0.65 per unit increase, 95% CI 0.49-0.85, p = 0.002), whilst CACI did not (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03, p = 0.09).Conclusions: Frailty appears to be a major factor in decision making regarding admission to CC, even after adjusting for age, gender and other known comorbidities. Quantification of frailty using the CCFS may be a valuable tool in risk stratification and resource allocation, and merits further investigation in this context.",

            "text": "Intensive care unit (ICU) admission triage is performed routinely in ICUs of developed and developing countries and is often based solely on clinical judgement, which could mask unethical prejudice or bias. Therefore, development of an objective triage score and of guidelines applying to individual patients has been discussed in the literature. To help triage decisions for ICU admission, a critical care team was assembled to come up with an instrument to aid triage decisions, based on the Society of Critical Care Medicine's (SCCM) guidelines. We sought to evaluate the validity and reliability of this instrument. Methods: An algorithm based on responses to an ICU request form was developed to classify patients in each of four SCCM's priority strata. Nine physicians with experience in critical care or emergency medicine evaluated forty clinical vignettes for reliability analyzes. The correlation of algorithm-based priorities with surrogate gold standards, defined by a panel of specialists, was evaluated in a validity analysis. Validity was further evaluated by applying this algorithm to a retrospective sample of 603 patients with requests for ICU admission, for association with outcomes. Results: Overall agreement was substantial, with a weighted kappa of 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.65). Algorithm-based priorities were also correlated with the priorities ascribed by specialists, with a weighted kappa of 0.67 (95% CI 0.60-0.74) and with subjective assessments of appropriateness of ICU admission. Algorithm-based priorities were also associated with ICU admission and hospital mortality (priorities 1,2, 3 and 4 had hospital mortality rates of 35.5%, 27.6%, 46.1% and 66.1%, respectively, P < 0.05). However, in an unadjusted analysis, there was no differential mortality benefit of ICU admission in each priority stratum. Conclusions: This ICU admission triage tool demonstrated good reliability, validity and predictive characteristics. However, it may not be suitable to standard practice, yet, since it was not properly evaluated to demonstrate a difference in benefit of ICU admission, justifying the admission of one priority stratum over the others. Further prospective studies with additional collected variables should be implemented to address its limitations.Conclusions: Workload at the ICU may be high, but seemed not too hard for the respondents. It is assumable that workload, with the emotional high burden, is acknowledged as an integral part of ICU work. ICU HCP understand the patients and relatives, but remain at a certain distance emotionally. The results of this study suggested no influence on work engagement by empathic ability.",

            "text": "Empowering the intensive care practitioners. is it a burnout ameliorating intervention? P. Ostrowski 1 Introduction: Burnout is a rapid resurgent worldwide problem; intensive care unit (ICU) practitioners are particularly at risk. Leaderempowering behavior could reduce the encountered job tension and enhancement of work effectiveness [1] . We aim to assess the role of empowerment on ICU practitioners' burnout. Methods: Mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology was used in a cross-sectional descriptive survey. The case study focused on Qatari ICU where anonymous questionnaire survey was presented to the staff members including physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists who work as full time. We used two main instruments, Maslasch Burnout scale (MBI-HSS), and Empowerment scale (ES). High burnout is considered when MBI-HSS is scores of 27 and more [2] . Results: Two-hundred healthcare practitioners were enrolled in mixed medical and surgical ICUs. Fifty-one ICU practitioners showed high prevalence association (25.5%). Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were equally presented at burnout association (p = 0.19). Age was associated with high burnout (p = 0.000), while gender was not. Empowerment was significantly associated with burnout by two-tailed test (p = 0.006). Positive empowerment had a negative effect on burnout variance (3.8%) when speculating practitioners' burnout. Conclusions: Empowerment components could reduce burnout within ICU. Particular attention should be given to the high burnout in ICU settings.Introduction: Circadian rhythm has a profound role in harmonising the function of organs and cells of the human body, while disruption of this rhythm (i.e. chronodisruption) is accompanied with a wide spectrum of pathological conditions. This rhythm in healthy subjects is mainly orchestrated by the daily cycles of light and darkness, as shown by the elevation of melatonin (MEL) levels peaking at dawn [1] . The aim of our prospective clinical study was to examine the rhythm of MEL release in ICU patients suffering from continuous light pollution.Methods: Mechanically ventilated patients over 18 years, without brain injury were enrolled into the study in January 2015. Illuminance was measured by a lux meter over the patients&#8217; body and serum MEL levels were determined from blood samples. Measurements took place after admission starting with the closest time point of the regular sampling period of 01:00, 07:00, 13:00 and 19:00 hours with a precision of &#177;10 min. for 4 days. Blood samples were kept in total darkness until clotting before being centrifuged 8 min. at 3000 rpm, then serum samples were placed into -80\u00b0C until MEL measurement was performed. Results: 15 patients were enrolled on a multidisciplinary ICU, with age of 63&#177;9 years, male/female ratio was 9/6. Out of the 16 measurements/patient, 240 MEL samples were analysed. MEL and illuminance levels are summarised in Fig. 106 . Although illuminance was the lowest at 01:00, but levels were still a lot higher than physiologically required. Furthermore, at 01:00 a MEL peak should occur [1] , which was also missing. A repeated correlation analysis between MEL serum concentration and illuminance levels showed a weak within-subject correlation (r = -0.097, P = 0.152), and a still nonsignificant between-subject correlation (r = 0.438, P = 0.103). Conclusions: Our results indicate that circadian rhythm is desynchronized in ICU patients, as indicated by a) the missing MEL peak during the night; b) by the poor correlation between illumination and MEL levels c) the absence of the normal 24h rhythm of MEL release. Future trials are hence warranted to test whether providing physiological light/dark conditions could resynchronise circadian rhythm and if it has any effect on patient outcomes.Introduction: Noise is an underestimated problem in the ICU that can attribute to sleep disturbance and delirium with an adverse effect on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. WHO recommendations of average sound levels below 35 dBA are not achievable in an ICU, where 50% of the time average sound levels exceeding 52 dBA are reported [1] . Since noise is also in our ICU considered a problem, we investigated sound levels and its causes and tried to implement a bundle of measures for noise reduction. Methods: We placed a sound level meter (Amptec 10EaZy RT) at two places in the ICU: one bedside in a two-bed room and one at the nursing station. Recordings were performed at each location continuously for a 24 hrs period. Simultaneously, structured observations were performed to identify the causes of elevated sound levels. After identifying the mean causes of noise and implementing a bundle of measures for noise reduction, the recordings and observations were repeated. Results: Average sound levels were comparable both bedside and at the nursing station before and after the noise reduction measures (Bedside: 52.8 dBA vs 52.9 dBA at night and 54.6 dBA vs 53.7 dBA at daytime -Nursing station: 52.6 dBA vs 52.2 at night and 53.9 dBA vs 53.2 dBA at daytime). There was also no difference in the incidence of sound level peaks (Bedside: 14 vs 16 -Nursing station: 11 vs 10). However, the maximum sound level peak bedside was significantly reduced (101.1 dBA vs 91.6 dBA). Further, observations showed that operational sounds and not structural sounds are the main cause for noise in the ICU. In particular, the ICU-team (nurses, doctors, \u2026) seemed to be the main contributing factor. Conclusions: Reduction of noise in the ICU is complex and multimodal. Reaching WHO levels seems not feasible in a ICU setting since measures for noise reduction can temper peaks but not the average sound level. Since the ICU-team is the main contributing factor, behavioural guidelines play an important role in noise reduction. Introduction: In the humanized care in the critical patient, the bedwashing is an internalized activity with impact over the risk involved for the accidental removal of invasive devices, and our intensive care unit it is not exempt from this. It was modified the bed-washing protocol, in order to measure the impact of direct supervision and professionalized nursing intervention during the bad-washing in relation with the incidence of accidental removal of invasive devices. Methods: The incidence of accidental removal of invasive devices (orotracheal tube, arterial catheter, central venous access, surgical drainage and indwelling urinary catheter) were reviewed of the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universidad de Chile doing the difference between the totals events of those into the bed-washing in our patients. It was coordinated a continuous medical education to nursing team (emergency and intensive nurses, technicians of nurses and auxiliaries) modifying the bed-washing protocol, including the direct supervision and nursing intervention in critical patients with invasive devices. It was defined two periods for comparison (2003-2005 and 2012-2014 ). The incidents rates were analyzed for the study period by Kwallis nonparametric test. Significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The incidents rates of accidental removal of invasive devices were reviewed of ICU through the database nursing department of our hospital. The period of diagnostic described 76 events of accidental removal of invasive devices; 13 into the bad-washing (rate: 1.18 adjusted events per year). In the evaluation period, 60 events are reported and 7 during the bed-washing (rate: 0.64 adjusted events per year). The rates showed significant differences in the totals events (p = 0.02). To compare rates of bed-washing events, a significant difference was observed in relation to the change of protocol (p = 0.04). Conclusions: A decrease was evident in the overall incidence of the accidental removal of invasive devices in liaison to continuous medical education (p = 0.02). The same is observed on the incidence during the bed-washing, between the period of diagnostic and evaluation of the intervention (p = 0.04). The presence of nursing into the bed-washing decreases significantly the rates of the accidental removal of invasive devices. We believe these data validate the implementation of our bed-washing protocol. Introduction: The aim of this audit is to investigate the compliance of a critical care unit (CCU) with the application of Deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) authorisations. DoLS form part of the UK's Mental Capacity Act and are intended to safeguard the rights of patients who lack mental capacity, and whose freedom to leave a healthcare environment is potentially limited. [1] They require written application to the local authority in order to gain permission for the patients on going care. However, because of the fact that this situation potentially applies to some patients in the CCU, an unintended consequence of the legislation is that it is increasingly being applied to critically ill patients. This can result in a significant workload for both the critical care team and the local council. Methods: A search was made on the Phillips ICIP electronic record over a 10-month period (19th Dec 2014 -8th Sept 2015) for the number of patients who had a mental health assessment form completed, declaring them as lacking capacity. A detailed search of their notes on the electronic patient record (EPR) was made in order to look retrospectively at the number of DoLS applications made in comparison to the number required. Results: Out of a total of 994 admissions, 34 patients lacked capacity at some point during their stay. These were divided into emergency medical (56%), elective surgical (35%) and emergency surgical admissions (9%) respectively. Of 31 patients who were retrospectively deemed eligible for a DoLS, 7 (23%) had an application submitted to the local council. The reasons why authorisations were necessary were divided in to tracheostomy related (45%), chemical/physical restraint for delirium (39%) and other best interest decision (16%). On average a DoLS authorisation was necessary for 4.5 days. The local authority denied no applications. The average time between identifying a lack of capacity and completion of DoLS application was 5.2 days. Conclusions: A significant number of patients admitted to CCU who lack mental capacity may be at risk of having their liberty deprived. A compliance rate of 23% may be a reflection of the way DoLS can now be applied to CCUs. Local interventions, such as routine preconsent and streamlining of the DoLS application process are being implemented with the intention of reducing work load and improving the rate of compliance with the law. mortality with higher scores may suggest use in informing treatment stratifications in elderly critically ill patients. Identification of the most appropriate individual parameters and their relative contributions towards an overall score merits further evaluation. Methods: a prospective observational study of end of life decisions made by medical professionals and whether the patient, family, or legal representative were involved in the end of life decisions. Results: 240 patients were admitted in ICU for a 3 month period of which 42 patients died in ICU (17.5%) 2 patients died in the ward following withdrawal of care.29(65.9%) of whom had died followed withdrawal or withholding of care.11(18% of the dead)had spontaneous cardiac arrest or`Brain Dead.all patients who had limitation of therapy had family consensus,of which 2 were autonomous decision of the patients. Conclusions: the reasons for withdrawal of care was either unresponsive to maximal therapy or irreversible neurologic status,The optimal use of resources and the good practise of optimal care in ICU remains a challenge .Consnsus with the family remains a challenge despite good communication and well educated clientele.There is still scope for improvement in these areas. Introduction: Around 50% of deaths in the UK occur in hospital, giving a total of around 250 000 in 2013 [1] . The responsibility of confirmation and documentation of these deaths rests across all specialties of hospital doctor. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC) released a consensus guideline in 2008 aiming to standardise this process [2] . Guidance is available for the diagnosis of death following cardiorespiratory arrest and death following cessation of brainstem function. The diagnosis should be transparent, consistent and instil public confidence in the process. This audit took a retrospective look at current practice and adherence to these guidelines. Methods: A retrospective case notes examination was carried out between February and August 2015. 98 deaths were observed on Whiston ICU during this period. Doctors carrying out the reviews were not involved in the process of diagnosing death in order not to bias the study findings. Data was collected from entries made in the patient's case notes and compared with recommended standards set out within AMRC guidelines. These include absence of heart and breath sounds, central pulse and corneal reflex. The patient should have been observed for 5 minutes and the time and date entered in the patient record, along with the name/grade of doctor. Results: Of the 98 verifications of death examined, the % compliance was as follows: Heart sounds 89.7, central pulse 82.6, respiratory effort 92.8, observed 5 minutes 9.1 (absent in 35 cases), pain response 72.1, pupillary response 89.7, corneal reflex 6.1, time correct 74.4, date correct 80.6, signed 97.9, printed name 97.9, grade 81.6. In the 63 cases where duration of observation was documented, mean time of was 2.1 minutes. There was only 1 instance of practice falling in line with current guidelines. Conclusions: Despite AMRC consensus guidelines being available for best practice in diagnosis of death, there remains a great deal of variation in practice for this common procedure. Only 1% of the case notes examined met the guidelines, with the majority not observing the patient for long enough or documenting a corneal reflex. Furthermore, 20% of cases were found to have documented the time/ date of death incorrectly. We propose that these wide variations in practice can easily be addressed with the introduction of a standardised proforma to be completed and signed by the clinician at the time of verification.",

The main advantages for its use include dermoprotection while disadvantages of its use include the limited abundance of donors and availability of surgical retrival team. This paper will explore the role of skin procurement performed by intensive care physicians. Methods: Data from skin procurement performed in Modena hospital were analyzed from 2006 to 2014. After attending Burn Care Unit in Cesena and a short training with a plastic surgeon who usually perfermed this kind of procedure, two intensive care physicians were able to perform skin retrival since 2011. Electric dermatome was used to remove skin. After the retrival skin grafts are sent to bank tissue. The activities of skin and tissues banks currently involve their recovery, processing, storage and distribution. Results: Human skin allografts were obtained from multi organ and tissue donors after both brain and cardiac death. During these nine years, 84 deceased donor skin allograft donations were performed. A significant improvement of numbers of skin procurement was observed from 2011 after the introduction of intensive care physicians as surgical team (Fig. 107) . Quality and quantity of human skin allografts procured by intensivists were comparable to those procured by plastic surgeons. Introduction: The management of critically ill patients is often challenging for clinicians with most being sedated or too unwell to be actively involved in aspects of their care. The quality of care received by patients can also vary between hospital locations, which in turn influences family perceptions of care provision. Family members are surrogates for patients and monitoring their experiences positively influences patient outcomes [1] . The aim of this study was to identify whether the source of admission to critical care had any impact family satisfaction. Methods: This prospective study was conducted over a period of eight weeks on our critical care unit. Up to four relatives per patient prior to discharge from the unit, or after initiation of end of life care, were requested to fill in a modified (Family satisfaction Survey (FSS)-ICU questionnaire. The qualitative responses obtained using a Likert scale were transformed into numerical data for analysis. Results: 34 completed surveys were analysed with majority of the respondents being female (65%). 46% of the patients were admitted from the emergency resuscitation department and whilst admissions from the inpatient wards accounted for 34%. Of the patients admitted from the emergency department the level of satisfaction was excellent (56%) or very good (54%) in all aspects of the patient care, as opposed to 36% of patients from the ward Conclusions: The results show that relatives are more likely to be satisfied when admitted from the emergency department than the from an inpatient ward. There is a correlation between inclusion in the decision-making process and overall satisfaction. The timely manner in which patients are admitted from the emergency department (RESUS) as well as the levels of staffing on initial management may account for the results seen. Introduction: ICU survivors suffer persistent physical, psychological and social problems in the months and years after discharge from critical care (1) . Caregivers of these patients also suffer similar problems (2) . As a result, an innovative, peer supported rehabilitation programme-Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) was created in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. This 5 week multi disciplinary programme, which is co facilitated by patient and family volunteers further along the recovery trajectory, aims to empower patients and caregivers to take control of their health and wellbeing. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of the volunteers who participated in InS:PIRE. It also Introduction: In 2007 we found a clear tendency in Italian PICUs to apply restrictive visiting policies [1] . However, we also pointed out that a formal process of revision of the ward's visiting policies was underway in roughly half of the units. Therefore, we carried out a new national survey to evaluate this issue in Italian PICUs. Methods: An email questionnaire was sent to the heads of all 30 Italian PICUs asking about their visiting policies. Results: The response rate was 100%. Median daily visiting time was 7 hours. Twenty per cent of surveyed PICUs (6/30) had unrestricted policies where one parent is allowed to be present both day and night, while 59% of units (17/30) do not allow constant presence of a parent even during the day. Children were not permitted to visit in 64% (19/30) of PICUs. In the case of a dying patient, 53% of PICUs (16/30) extended visiting hours, 77% (23/30) increased the number of slots, and 77% (23/30) allowed more visitors. A gowning procedure was compulsory for visitors in 70% (21/30) of PICUs. No waiting room for family members and visitors was provided by 13% of units (4/30). Thirteen PICUs out of thirty (43%) recently revised the ward's visiting policies. Conclusions: Although in Italian PICUs persists a tendency to apply restrictive visiting policies, these findings suggests that a revision of current policies is underway and that over the last eight years there has been perceptible change in favour of the liberalization of visiting in the Italian pediatric critical care setting. Despite the many objections considered valid in the past, there is conclusively no scientific basis for limiting family presence in ICU [2] . Our survey could contribute towards liberalizing visiting policies in Italian PICUs and promoting more attentive care for the patient and his/her family.",
