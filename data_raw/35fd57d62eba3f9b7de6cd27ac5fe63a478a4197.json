Here, we assembled a full-length infectious cDNA clone of TGEV in a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using a novel approach, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems efficiently and rapidly rescued another recombinant virus with a 224-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene (S_NTD224), which is analogous to the N-terminal domain of porcine respiratory coronavirus. S_NTD224 notably affected the TGEV growth kinetics in PK-15 cells but was not essential for recombinant virus survival. In animal experiments with 13 two-day-old piglets, the TGEV recombinant viruses with/without S_NTD224 deletion induced obvious clinical signs and mortality. Together, our results directly demonstrated that S_NTD224 of TGEV mildly influenced TGEV virulence but was not the enteric tropism determinant and provide new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine against TGEV. Importantly, the optimized reverse genetics platform used in this study will simplify the construction of mutant infectious clones and help accelerate progress in coronavirus research.",

TGEV is widespread in the pork industry, causes high mortality in neonatal pigs, and is generally thought to share a common ancestor with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) [13] . Both TGEV and PRCV have a common cell receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN), but a coreceptor (Neu5Gc) of TGEV is recognized to confer enteric tropism to TGEV [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, TGEV always causes severe diarrhea, whereas PRCV usually causes mild or no clinical signs [18] . Compared with TGEV Spike gene, large deletions (200-230 aa) were found in the N-terminal domain of PRCV Spike gene [19] . The N-terminal domain of the S-glycoprotein is considered to be responsible for the different clinical signs of TGEV and PRCV and is generally recognized as not only the virulence determinant but also an enteric tropism determinant [13, 20] . Previous research has shown that PRCVs are likely derived from an N-terminal amino-acid deletion of the TGEV Spike protein [15, 21] , but direct evidence obtained from reverse genetics is still needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

Among the various reverse genetics methods for CoVs, transfection of the full-length infectious cDNA clone and cotransfection of the full-length RNA and N gene transcripts are the most commonly adopted methods for the rescue of recombinant viruses [25, 26, [28] [29] [30] . However, these methods usually require the manipulation of several cDNA fragments or plasmids for the construction of a new mutant CoV [31] . Although targeted RNA recombination or the Red-mediated recombination strategy might partly accelerate or simplify the process of constructing an infectious recombinant virus, the selection of the correct positive clone is also a time-consuming process [32] [33] [34] [35] . In fact, the limitations of the various currently available traditional reverse genetics methods for CoV genome manipulation, such as ligation with several cDNA fragments in vitro, targeted RNA recombination, division of toxic gene sequence propagation in bacteria, or recombinant vaccinia virus vectors, have severely hampered the speed and efficiency of developing CoV reverse genetics techniques [23, [36] [37] [38] .",

Briefly, two specific enzyme sites encompassing the sequence of S_NTD224 were selected.

The transcribed products corresponding to sites a and b (designated sgRNA a and sgRNA b) ( Figure 3C ) were incubated with the nuclease Cas9 to digest the pTGEV-GFP BAC in vitro, and the digestion yielded a linearized BAC and a~2.1-kb DNA fragment that included the sequence of S_NTD224 ( Figure 3A,D) .",

All the piglets in the TGEV-GFP group exhibited severe clinical symptoms and weight loss, and those in the TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD group showed ameliorated but still obvious clinical symptoms ( Figure 5A,B) . In addition, the piglets in the TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD groups appeared moribund within 3 days postinoculation, whereas the piglets in the mock-infected control group remained healthy ( Figure 5C ).

More severe villous atrophy was observed in the small intestine, particularly the jejunum and ileum, of the piglets in the TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD groups compared with those of the mock group ( Figure 6B ).

The CRISPR/Cas9 system was then used to finish the construction of pTGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD. To our knowledge, this study provides the first demonstration of the direct in vitro manipulation of full-length coronavirus cDNA. To edit specific CoV genes, targeted cleavage of the BAC was completed by Cas9 protein through a reaction mediated by two types of sgRNA transcribed together or separately ( Figure 3B,D) . sgRNA can be easily obtained by annealing PCR and transcription using an available kit. Moreover, regardless of the exonuclease trimming activities of Cas9 [45] , in the experiment, we were able to insert the mutated fragments in the linearized BAC with 200-bp overlapping sequences through homologous recombination.",

Similar to traditional plasmid manipulation, we edited the targeted gene by recombination in vitro with overlapping PCR products (e.g., mutations, deletions, or insertions). Moreover, as little as 100 ng of linearized, digested BAC was sufficient to complete the recombination reaction. To determine the mutation of the targeted BAC, we only needed to amplify the fragments by bacterial PCR using a pair of primers in duplicate, and this assay can be used to sequence the site of recombination and the modified fragment area. Furthermore, almost any area of the targeted BAC can be simply cleaved by the CRISPR/Cas9 system with two types of specific sgRNA. Throughout the process, we accomplished recombinant virus recovery using only one plasmid of BAC in a single week ( Figure 3) . Namely, once an infectious clone was constructed, the recombinant coronaviruses was more efficiently and conveniently rescued in this study than in previous research, and the proposed approach thus greatly accelerates the gene editing speed of large RNA virus rescue. Moreover, the simple manipulation of a BAC vector and modification of the specific small region throughout the procedure would theoretically lower the mutation probability of the full-length CoV cDNA. Thus, this method is not only cost-effective but also reduces the probability of introducing additional mutations during the BAC modification procedure.",

However, recombinant TGEV with S protein N-terminal amino-acid deletion was constructed through targeted recombination and passaged several times, which might cause other locus mutations in addition to the S protein deletion [20] . In particular, an early study reported that a 224-residue deletion in PRCV corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the TGEV S protein, as depicted in Figure 3A , is likely responsible for the loss of replication observed in the enteric tract [21] . No other studies have provided direct evidence demonstrating that only the N-terminal region of the Spike gene changes the TGEV virulence or enteric tropism [57] . Here, we emphasize the importance of the N-terminus of the TGEV S protein for the enteric tropism of the virus. To that end, we constructed a recombinant virus with an S protein analogous to that of PRCV ( Figure 3A) , TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD, and this recombinant virus showed titers and fluorescent plaque sizes that greatly differed from those of TGEV-GFP ( Figure 4E,F) . These results indicated that the 224 amino acids of the N-terminal of the TGEV Spike protein are not essential for viral survival but important for viral replication or infection, which was analogous to the findings obtained for PEDV and other CoVs [58] [59] [60] [61] . Our animal experiments revealed that TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD caused 40% mortality in piglets and obvious intestinal tissue damage, which indicates that S_NTD224 has a mild influence on virulence but does not alter the enteric tropism of TGEV [62] .",

One reason explaining no detection of TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD in the two piglets euthanized at 7 days post-inoculation might be related to immunity of recovering piglets. The role of S_NTD224 might be analogous to that of the 197-amino-acid region in the N-terminus of the PEDV S gene when used as a viral virulence marker. Consistent with previous reports, our experiments also detected TGEV-GFP and TGEV-GFP-\u2206S_NTD in the jejunal contents tissue by nested RT-PCR [63, 64] , which indicates that changes in S_NTD224 alone do not alter TGEV enteric tropism in vivo. And it is also possible that other genes in addition to the 224 amino acids of the N-terminal of the TGEV Spike protein might regulate changes in TGEV tissue tropism [20, 58] . Additional research is needed to determine the detailed mechanism of TGEV enteric tropism in vivo.",

These results provide new insights into the development of a new attenuated vaccine against TGEV. Furthermore, the method developed in this study allows the efficient and rapid editing of the full-length CoV genome in vitro and can theoretically be applied to all viruses with large RNA genomes once the full-length cDNA is obtained.",
