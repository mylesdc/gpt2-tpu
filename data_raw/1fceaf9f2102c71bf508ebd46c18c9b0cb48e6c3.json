            "text": "Resolving knowledge gaps in influenza epidemiology in Egypt serves several purposes. First, a seasonal influenza vaccine is available each year that can prevent infections. Recent U.S. estimates of the effectiveness of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines ranged from 19-60% [15] . Even a moderately effective vaccine could reduce influenza-associated hospitalizations and lost worker productivity. Understanding whether influenza strains match those in either Northern or Southern Hemisphere circulation will elucidate whether Northern or Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine is a viable policy. Additionally, data on whether demographic subpopulations are disproportionately affected by influenza may lead to designation of priority groups if vaccine availability is low. Second, improved understanding of the timing of influenza circulation may result in a more cost-efficient timing of resource allocation (e.g., antivirals) for hospitals and other clinical settings. This could reduce financial burdens on hospitals during times of elevated influenza transmission. Finally, enhanced data on annual influenza activity may provide a baseline metric to evaluate future activity. Therefore, influenza epidemics may be detected earlier allowing public health officials to respond faster and have more opportunity to interrupt transmission.",

A hospital surveillance team conducted SARI surveillance at each site. These teams included a surveillance coordinator, internist, pediatrician, and laboratory focal person, each of whom was trained on case definitions, enrollment procedures, specimen collection, and data recording. Teams screened all hospitalized patients with the SARI case definition.

Data from Egypt's SARI surveillance system were used to describe influenza hospitalizations at eight geographically-representative Egyptian hospitals across a seven-year period. We found that approximately one of every six SARI patients had an influenza infection, and during months of peak influenza activity, this was as high as one of every two. Influenza-positive patients were different from influenza-negative patients in a number of ways, though differences regarding ventilation, ICU admission, and death were inconclusive. Death among influenza-positive patients was associated with four characteristics. We also found marked influenza seasonality beginning in July each year and ending in June.

Among the age groups encompassing 5-65 years, patients were more likely to have influenza.

A similar proportion of influenza-positive and influenza-negative patients were 65 years or older, possibly reflecting that elderly adults are simply predisposed to ARIs of various etiologies. Other factors associated with influenza among those hospitalized with SARI from this study include pregnancy and chronic conditions. Influenza-positive women were more likely to be pregnant, and numerous other studies have identified pregnancy as a risk factor for influenza and influenza complications [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Chronic conditions were also associated with influenza hospitalization, as 27% of influenza-positive patients had at least one.

Regardless, patients with influenza infection comprised 19% of total SARI deaths. Analysis of influenza mortality among hospitalized patients with influenza found four potential risk factors: older age, chronic conditions, a longer duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and influenza A virus infection. Overall, the number of deaths was greater for those with influenza A than influenza B, which aligns with previous research [37] [38] . The influenza subtype with the highest mortality (50%) was A/ H5N1 avian influenza. As of March 3, 2015, the worldwide A/H5N1 case fatality rate was 55% [39] , similar to our finding. Furthermore, though 13% of patients with influenza A/unsubtyped died, there were only eight such infections. Additionally, a longer duration from symptom onset to hospitalization increased the odds of death among influenza-positive patients. This supports previous research that found a longer duration from influenza symptom onset to hospitalization increased the odds of death [40] [41] , which may be due to individuals' healthcareseeking behavior, i.e., avoiding a hospital visit until it is too late for medical intervention.",

These seasonal peaks were largely driven by influenza A, and in some seasons, there were bimodal influenza peaks corresponding to an earlier influenza A peak followed by a later influenza B peak. Climate has been shown to correlate with influenza activity worldwide, particularly lower temperatures and lower relative humidity [42] [43] [44] .

The system identified predominant influenza strains each season [45] , indicating some seasonal influenza transmission could have been interrupted by vaccination. However, future studies are needed to antigenically characterize the predominant influenza strains in Egypt to assess their similarity to strains included in the corresponding season's vaccine. Possible priority groups for vaccination in Egypt include pregnant women, individuals with chronic conditions, and older adults based on aforementioned findings.",

These data indicate that Egyptian hospitals should prepare for peak influenza activity from November-May. Stockpiling antiviral medication, increasing staff capacity, and reserving hospital beds could begin in October and be scaled back in May. Also, MOH and partners could use these data to determine average weekly influenza hospitalization activity (smoothed with moving averages) for evaluation of future activity. This will allow for earlier discovery of unusual influenza activity, including crossing of epidemic thresholds, allowing for a faster public health intervention.",

            "text": "There were limitations to these data. First, the system's detection of influenza relied on the case definition's sensitivity and specificity, and the definition changed over time based on WHO guidance. It is possible the system missed some hospitalized individuals with influenza. However, the case definition was standardized across the network and the system detected a higher proportion of influenza SARI hospitalizations than other countries. Second, more comprehensive demographic and clinical data were unavailable, and thus more nuanced analyses of risk factors were not possible. This is a reality of surveillance as only basic data are collected to reduce staff burden. Third, data were missing for a sizeable number of individuals for some variables. Therefore, statistical comparisons were presented both including and excluding missing data, and some comparisons yielded divergent results (implying statistical significance was driven by the extent of missing data for some variables). Work to maintain the quality and integrity of surveillance data through the EMARIS Network is ongoing, including improving motivation among hospital surveillance teams.",

            "text": "Strengths of this study stem from its scale, length of observation, and capabilities to detect influenza virus. The use of eight sentinel hospitals representatively distributed throughout Egypt allowed for adequate generalizability of findings to the national level. Furthermore, with over 17,000 patients enrolled, there was ample power to detect meaningful differences in demographic, clinical, and virological characteristics. The seven-year period of surveillance afforded the opportunity to examine influenza seasonality over time, which is only possible with several years of data. Finally, Egypt's CPHL and NAMRU-3 enabled sensitive and specific detection of influenza viruses and types via rtRT-PCR for all 17,441 SARI patients. This is the first documented examination of national influenza epidemiology in Egypt. Given the dearth of influenza knowledge in the EMR, our study helps fill a critical epidemiologic gap for the second most populous country in the region. Our findings indicate that influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, it appears to have Northern Hemisphere seasonality, though not as pronounced as in temperate climate countries. Therefore, seasonal influenza vaccination may be a viable policy. Ultimately, the EMARIS Network provided numerous benefits, namely increased epidemiologic and laboratory capacity, enhanced International Health Regulations (2005) compliance, and a sustainable SARI surveillance system. Such a system is a crucial component of modern disease control, as evidenced by the recent appearance of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [46] . It may also be adapted for other novel ARIs, which is imperative given growing concern over the emergence of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential [47] [48] . Continued surveillance for influenza and further assessment of its molecular epidemiology will better inform decision-makers about disease control activities in Egypt and the greater EMR.",
