            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and many critical roles in numerous biological processes. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-\u03baB-inhibitor \u03b1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-\u03baB pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3' UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-\u03baB-signaling pathway. Our findings will aid the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for PEDV infection.",

The highly pathogenic PEDV variants first appeared in October 2010 in China, during an outbreak characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets [2] . PEDV later spread to the United States and other countries, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry. PEDV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of~28 kb in length and containing a 5 cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail [3] . PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the Coronavirus family, and encodes two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1a/b) that, upon further processing, result in 16 nonstructural proteins, including an accessory protein (ORF3) and four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N).",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~23 nt), noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by degrading mRNAs and/or inhibiting translation [4] . Mammalian miRNAs target mRNAs primarily by pairing with cis-regulatory sites in the 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) to direct their posttranscriptional repression [5] , with an important target motif identified as \u00e3 7-nt site that matches the seed region of the miRNA [6] . By base pairing to mRNAs, miRNAs mediate translational repression or mRNA degradation to control mRNA stability and translation [7] . During host-virus interactions, miRNAs also play important regulatory roles by inhibiting viral replication through the direct targeting of viral genomic RNA [8, 9] . Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs regulate innate immune responses in response to viral infection. miR-146 acts as a negative regulatory loop of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-signaling pathway by targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 and interleukin (IL)-1-receptor-associated kinase 1 [10] . Additionally, miR-21 is regulated by the signal transducer and an activator of transcription (STAT)3 pathway, and activates the NF-\u03baB pathway by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog [11] . Moreover, miR-302c represses NF-\u03baB expression by directly targeting the 3 UTR of NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) [12] . However, regulation of PEDV infection by miRNA is poorly understood. Several studies reported interactions between PEDV and the innate immune system. PEDV infection inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production by translating three virus-encoded protein nucleocapsids (N), viral papain-like protease 2, and non-structural protein 1 and 5, which interfere with components associated with the IFN response and downregulate IFN expression [13, 14] . However, the mechanism by which cells initiate natural immune responses to PEDV invasion has not been studied.",

Induction of type I IFN converges with the activation of TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB-activator-binding kinase 1/I\u03baB kinase (IKK)i, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, and mitogen-activated protein kinases which, in turn, promote the phosphorylation and activation of IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)3, NF-\u03baB, and activating protein (AP)-1, respectively. For NF-\u03baB activation, PRRs initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the IKK phosphorylation, which subsequently phosphorylates and ubiquitinates I\u03baB-\u03b1 bound to NF-\u03baB in resting cells, and results in I\u03baB-\u03b1 proteasomal degradation, thereby allowing NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation to transcriptionally activate its gene targets [15] . Excessive activation of innate immunity is a hallmark of serious diseases; therefore, organisms have evolved mechanisms to negatively modulate the pathway. I\u03baB negatively regulates the NF-\u03baB pathway by binding to NF-\u03baB, resulting in its sequestration in the cytoplasm. Additionally, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative regulator of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling [16] , and also binds to p65 in the nucleus and acts a ubiquitin ligase to limit prolonged p65-mediated signaling [17] .",

Additionally, we used RegRNA [18] and ViTa [19] to screen potential miRNAs against PEDV infection. Our results revealed a highly conserved miR-221-5p TS in the 3 UTR of the PEDV genome, with subsequent experiments confirming miR-221-5p suppression of PEDV infection by directly targeting the 3 UTR of the viral genome. Moreover, we found that miR-221-5p activated the NF-\u03baB pathway by targeting two negative regulators in MARC-145 cells, thereby suggesting a regulatory mechanism wherein host miRNA activates the NF-\u03baB pathway during viral infection.",

Following co-transfection of the pmirGLO-target-WT construct with miR-221-5p mimics into HEK293T cells, we observed that the miR-221-5p mimics significantly inhibited luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest inhibition percentage measured at 90% in the presence of both 50 and 100 nM miR-221-5p mimics ( Figure 4B) . Notably, the luciferase activity of in cells transfected with the 3\u2032 UTR-Mut remained unchanged, confirming that miR-221-5p specifically binds to the TS. We then investigated whether the downregulated luciferase activity associated with the 3\u2032 UTR-WT could be rescued in the presence of an miR-221-5p inhibitor or by PEDV infection. The results showed significant decreases in the luciferase activity of 3\u2032 UTR-WT in cells transfected with the miR-221-5p mimics (up to 20% relative to controls) ( Figure 4C ), whereas this decrease was reversed in cells transfected with the miR-221-5p inhibitor or infected with PEDV, suggesting that the miR-221-5p mimics targeted the viral genome rather than the luciferase-reporter sequence. This result demonstrated that PEDV genomic RNA harbors the miR-221-5p TS, which enables miR-221-5p-mediated repression of PEDV infection.",

To determine whether miR-221-5p inhibits PEDV replication through activation of the innate immune response, we measured the expression of cytokines, such as IFNs, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1 and ISG15. Real-time qRT-PCR analysis following miR-221-5p transfection during PEDV infection revealed that miR-221-5p enhanced cytokine and ISG expression during CH/HBTS/2016 infection ( Figure 5A ), thereby suggesting a role for miR-221-5p in regulating the innate immune response. To rule out possible miRNA-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 as a ligand, we determined the phosphorylation level of IKK, a hallmark of TLR3 activation ( Figure 5B ). The results showed that IKK was not phosphorylated following miR-221-5p transfection, thereby confirming that upregulated IFN and ISG expression was not attributable to TLR3 activation. These results showed that miR-221-5p upregulated IFN and ISG expression to mediate the innate immune response against PEDV infection in MARC-145 cells. Following co-transfection of the pmirGLO-target-WT construct with miR-221-5p mimics into HEK293T cells, we observed that the miR-221-5p mimics significantly inhibited luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest inhibition percentage measured at 90% in the presence of both 50 and 100 nM miR-221-5p mimics ( Figure 4B) . Notably, the luciferase activity of in cells transfected with the 3 UTR-Mut remained unchanged, confirming that miR-221-5p specifically binds to the TS. We then investigated whether the downregulated luciferase activity associated with the 3 UTR-WT could be rescued in the presence of an miR-221-5p inhibitor or by PEDV infection. The results showed significant decreases in the luciferase activity of 3 UTR-WT in cells transfected with the miR-221-5p mimics (up to 20% relative to controls) ( Figure 4C ), whereas this decrease was reversed in cells transfected with the miR-221-5p inhibitor or infected with PEDV, suggesting that the miR-221-5p mimics targeted the viral genome rather than the luciferase-reporter sequence. This result demonstrated that PEDV genomic RNA harbors the miR-221-5p TS, which enables miR-221-5p-mediated repression of PEDV infection.",

To verify the roles of NFKBIA and SOCS1 in regulating PEDV replication, we silenced NFKBIA and SOCS1, and confirmed knockdown of their respective protein levels ( Figure 8A,B) . We found that small-interfering (si)RNA silencing of NFKBIA and SOCS1 (si-NFKBIA and si-SOCS1) significantly activated IFN-\u03b2 expression, accompanied by decreases in PEDV viral titer and intracellular levels of viral genomic RNA ( Figure 8C-E) .

These results demonstrated that NFKBIA and SOCS1 suppressed IFN-\u03b2 expression to favor PEDV replication, thereby suggesting essential roles in regulating IFN expression and viral replication. Comparisons between groups were determined by Student's t test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.",

Previous studies reported that miR-181 and miR-23 directly target viral genomic RNA to inhibit porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus replication [8, 36] , and miR-32 targets the primate foamy virus genome to suppress viral replication [30] . Additionally, several IFN-induced miRNAs (miR-196, miR-296, miR-351, miR-431, and miR-448) target the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome to inhibit HCV replication [37] . However, some miRNAs reportedly promote viral replication, including miR-122, which promotes HCV RNA accumulation by binding to HCV genomic RNA to stimulate its translation [38] . In the present study, we showed that miR-221-5p inhibited PEDV replication by targeting highly conserved regions in viral genomic RNA (Figure 4 ). Our findings that blockage of endogenous miR-221-5p significantly increased PEDV infection (Figures 2 and 3 ) demonstrated that miR-221-5p inhibited PEDV replication by binding to viral genomic RNA. miRNAs indirectly modulate host factors to influence the viral lifecycle. Since innate immunity is an essential defense mechanism against viral invasion, it is possible that miRNAs are involved in the IFN response or the NF-\u03baB activation, which represent critical aspects of signaling pathways associated with innate immunity [39] [40] [41] [42] . A previous study showed that miR-26a, miR-34a, miR-145, and let-7b regulate IFN-\u03b2 expression during viral infection via a negative feedback loop [43] . In the present study, we predicted that miR-221-5p target genes were associated with the TLR-and NF-\u03baB-signaling pathways. In human colorectal cancer cells, miR-221 acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain continuous activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway [44] . These findings suggested a role for miR-221-5p in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway to alter PEDV replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p upregulated the expression of the IFNs and ISGs through the NF-\u03baB pathway by downregulating I\u03baB levels to promote p65 nuclear translocation. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-221-5p bound the 3 UTR of SOCS1, an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway and negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway [16, 20] . A recent study reported that SOCS1 binds the NF-\u03baB component p65 in the nucleus as a ubiquitin ligase in order to promote p65 degradation, limit prolonged p65-mediated signaling, and terminate the expression of NF-\u03baB-inducible genes [17] . In the present study, we confirmed that SOCS1 overexpression significantly downregulated IFN-\u03b2 levels, whereas SOCS1 silencing markedly upregulated IFN-\u03b2 expression. These findings suggested that miR-221-5p activated the NF-\u03baB pathway to suppress PEDV replication.",
