The Phyllanthus extract has anti-HBV activity; however, its antiviral activity against lamivudine (LMV)-resistant mutants has not been examined. Methods: HBV harboring LMV-resistant mutations (rtM204I, rtM204V, and rtM204S) in the P gene at the YMDD ( 203 tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate 206 ) reverse transcriptase (RT) active site were generated and their sensitivity to Phyllanthus urinaria koreanis extract examined. Southern blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of plant extract required to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis by 50 and 90 % (EC 50 and EC 90 , respectively). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the EC 50 of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) secretion, and the 50 % cytotoxic concentration of the extract was measured in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels. Results: The expression of intracellular HBV DNAs in HBV WT-or mutant-transfected HepG2 cells decreased upon treatment with Phyllanthus extract. The secretion of HBsAg and HBcAg also fell in a dose-dependent manner. Phyllanthus extract induced interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells, possibly via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-jun N-terminal kinases and the induction of retinoic acid inducible gene-I, toll-like receptor 3, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 gene expression. HBV transfection in the absence of extract or exposure of cells to extract alone did not trigger these signaling cascades.",

The low response rate and side effects associated with IFNs mean that nucleos(t)ide analogs are used most often. Nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibit the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of the HBV DNA polymerase (P), thereby interrupting the elongation of newly synthesized DNA. The drugs also lower alanine aminotransferase levels, reduce serum HBV DNA levels, and induce seroconversion of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) to anti-HBe in CHB patients.",

            "text": "LMV was the first nucleoside analog to be licensed (in 1998); however, 80 % of patients become resistant after 5 years of therapy [5] [6] [7] [8] . The most common mutation associated with LMV resistance is the substitution of methionine 204 with isoleucine, valine, or serine (M204I/V/S) at the YMDD active site motif within the P protein RT domain [9] [10] [11] . The L80V/I mutation was first detected in patients with severe hepatitis after apparent LMV failure [12] . Mutation at the L180 or A181 residues also contributes to LMV resistance [13] . M204V/I mutations associated with LMV and LdT resistance also confer cross-resistance to other L-nucleosides and reduce sensitivity to ETV (but not to ADV or TDF) [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . ADV-resistance also becomes a limiting factor for treatment, although it develops more slowly than resistance to LMV [18] . Like ADV, TDF (a methyl derivative of ADV) exhibits antiviral activity against LMV-resistant HBV [19] , although it is more potent than ADV and the rate of emergence of resistant mutants is slower. However, high doses of TDF and ADV cause nephrotoxicity in CHB patients [8] . Also, because nucleos(t)ide analogs do not prevent the initial formation of covalently closed circular DNA, new cells can be infected during therapy due to the persistent viremia [20] .",

Increased expression of IFN-\u03b1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA by extract-treated HepG2 cells containing replicating HBV may be due to the induction of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) expression.

Overlap of the HBs open reading frame (ORF) with the P gene leads to an alteration in two amino acids (Ile195 and Trp196) in all mutants (except YLDD); this change is likely to affect HBsAg secretion. In agreement with a previous report [9] , we observed reduced HBsAg secretion in cells transfected with YADD, YKDD, or YTDD (Fig. 3c) . The level of HBsAg secretion from YSDD-transfected cells was low because the YSDD mutant harbored an ATT CGG sequence in the HBs ORF, which codes Ile195 and Arg196 (the same as the HBs-negative YKDD and YTDD mutants) (Fig. 3c) . It should be noted here that the YSDD mutation identified in a LMV-resistant patient harbored AGT, coding for Ile195 and Val196 in the HBs ORF, and was HBsAg positive [11] , whereas our constructed mutant harbored TCG. In contrast to a previous report [9] , we found that the YRDD mutant secreted a very low level of HBsAg and replicated inefficiently (Fig. 3c) . With the exception of the YTDD mutant, HBcAg secretion by the mutant viruses was comparable with that by HBV WT (Fig. 3c) .",

Replicative intermediate HBV DNAs isolated from intracellular core particles were then analyzed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4) . Cells were treated with LMV (4 \u03bcg/ mL) and ADV (27.3 \u03bcg/mL or 100 \u03bcM) as controls (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3) . HBV DL DNA synthesis in LMV-, ADV-, and Phyllanthus extract-treated HBV WTtransfected HepG2 cells was 6.5, 15.5, and 17.9 % of that in untreated WT-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4a) . Similarly, LMV, ADV, and Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis in YADD-, YKDD-, YRDD-and YTDD-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4b , d, f, and h). Consistent with previous reports, HBV DNA synthesis by YIDD and YVDD mutants was not inhibited by LMV treatment, confirming that these mutants were LMVresistant ( Fig. 4c and i, lanes 3) . However, HBV DNA synthesis by the YIDD and YVDD mutants was inhibited by ADV and Phyllanthus extract ( Fig. 4c and i, lanes 2  and 4) . This, Phyllanthus extract maybe a useful treatment for LMV-resistant CHB patients. A previous study demonstrated that the YSDD variant was LMV-resistant [11] ; however, we found that HBV DNA synthesis by the YSDD mutant was only marginally inhibited by LMV (34.5 % HBV DL DNA) (Fig. 4g, lane 3) , indicating that an additional L180M mutation in the P gene [11] might confer LMV resistance. Nevertheless, ADV and Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis by the YSDD mutant more efficiently than LMV (Fig. 4g) .",

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other IFN-inducible cellular factors, such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalysis polypeptide 1like 3G (APOBEC3G) or human cytidine deaminase may be involved in limiting HBV replication without affecting pgRNA packaging [50] .

Unlike HBx over-expressed cells [55] , we found that COX-2 expression was not increased in HBV WT-transfected cells ( Fig. 5a and d, lanes 2) . Since upregulated expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein was observed only in HBV WT-transfected/extracttreated HepG2 cells ( Fig. 5a and d, lanes 3) , expression of COX-2 and IL-6 may be triggered in HBV replicating cells in the presence of Phyllanthus extract. Upregulation of COX-2 expression via activation of the ERK1/2 and/or JNK pathways may play a role in the observed antiviral activity (Fig. 5d, lane 3) . IL-6 regulates early HBV gene expression and inhibits HBV replication by activating the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways [58] . We speculate that increased IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, and COX-2 expression in HBV WT-transfected/Phyllanthus extract-treated HepG2 cells may induce the expression of IFN-inducible genes and/or different inflammatory mediators, which then inhibit HBV replication.",
