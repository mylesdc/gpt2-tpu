Background An increasing number of biologics are entering the development pipelines of pharmaceutical companies [1] . Today, the preferred production host for therapeutic proteins is the CHO cell line. However one of the major hurdles, especially for the production of non-antibody glycoproteins, is host cell-related proteolytic degradation which can drastically impact developability and timelines of pipeline projects. Material and methods Spike-in: CHO cells were cultivated in a chemically defined culture medium at 36.5\u00b0C/10% CO 2 in shake-flasks. When the cells reached their maximum viable density, they were removed by centrifugation and the conditioned medium was collected. A model mAb was spiked into the conditioned medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 protease inhibitors. The amount of proteolytic degradation was analysed by western blot and LC-MS. Transcriptomics: Total RNA was extracted after 3 days of cell cultivation. RNA sequencing libraries were constructed and processed on the HiSeq 2000 platform from Illumina. Generation of matriptase knockout: CHO-K1 cells were transfected with mRNA encoding \"transcription activator-like effector nucleases\" or \"zinc finger nucleases\" targeting matriptase exon 2. The transfected cells were subsequently sorted into single cells and analysed for frameshift mutations in both alleles via Sanger sequencing. Cell cultivation: Fed batch cultivation was performed in 15-mL miniaturized bioreactors (AMBR15).",

To reduce the number of candidate proteases we showed first that a model mAb (prone to proteolytic degradation) incubated in conditioned medium of CHO-K1 cells resulted in clipping of the mAb, demonstrating the involvement of secreted/shedded proteases (Fig. 1a) . Broad spectrum inhibitors of the different protease classes revealed that only serine protease inhibitors prevented clipping. Serine protease inhibitors of higher specificity highlighted the group of \"S1A trypsin-like proteases\" (Fig. 1a) . Comparison of the proteolytic degradation profile of several therapeutic proteins between CHO-K1 with another CHO cell line (CHO-A) revealed less degradation in CHO-A. Therefore expression of the involved protease(s) is likely lower in CHO-A. Gene expression profile analysis of both cell lines showed five secreted/shedded \"S1A trypsin-like serine proteases\" more than 1.5 fold lower expressed in CHO-CHO-A versus CHO-K1 (Fig. 1b) . Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown experiments of these five candidates identified \"Matriptase\" as the major protease involved in degradation of recombinant proteins expressed in CHO-K1 cells ( Fig. 1c upper panel) .",

No proteolytic degradation product was detected when the model mAb was spiked into conditioned medium of the KO cell line (Fig. 1c lower panel) . Also, stable expression of the model mAb in the KO cell line resulted in no/significantly less clipping (Fig. 1e) . The protein titer and the cell growth behaviour of the matriptase KO cells were similar to the corresponding wildtype (wt) cells (Fig. 1d) as shown by comparative cultivation in AMBR system. Conclusions One major challenge for the production of recombinant proteins is CHO host cell mediated proteolytic degradation which can negatively impact or even result in termination of projects [2; 3] . Using a variety of techniques such as applying protease inhibitors, transcriptomics and siRNA mediated knock-down we were able to identify \"matriptase\" as the major protease involved in degradation of recombinant proteins expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Subsequently we generated a matriptase deficient CHO cell line. Protein candidates of diverse formats, severely degraded in wt CHO-K1 cell line, were not or significantly less cleaved in the matriptase KO cell line. Furthermore cell growth, viability and productivity levels were comparable between the wt and the matriptase KO cell line. In summary, we have generated a superior platform-compatible CHO production host cell line with the same favourable productivity properties as the parental host cell line [4; 6] , allowing expression of complex glycoproteins prone to clipping. Background CHO cell lines are common hosts for the production of biopharmaceutical proteins. So far, considerable progress has been made increasing productivity of cell culture to meet the rapidly growing demand for antibody biopharmaceuticals through increased cell densities and longer culture times. The downside is the increase of the process related impurities, bringing new challenges for process and harvest development. Among the process related impurities such as host cell proteins (HCPs) or DNA the potential impact of lipids production and release during cell culture is still poorly understood due to the complex nature and diversity of this class of molecules. Thanks to recent advances in analytical tools especially mass spectrometry, the advent of lipidomics offers now the feasibility to study several thousands of lipid species thus unraveling the possibility to understand and potentially control the interactions between high performance bioreactor processes, harvest conditions and purification.",

Stable isotope labeled lipids were used as internal standard in order to have comparable results between batches. The obtained results (Fig. 1) show that for a given cell line, lipid distribution is changing over the process. Moreover, this distribution may vary significantly depending on the cell line: CL-1 and in a lower extend, CL-3, show an accumulation of triglycerides from day 6 to the end of the process, while CL-2 doesn't seems to follow this trend. Conclusion Interestingly, in some cell lines/experimental conditions, we highlighted an overproduction of triglycerides and cholesterol leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets known as energy storage sink. At the metabolic level, these findings suggest a relative overflow of the carbon metabolism. From a process development perspective these findings can be considered on the one hand as a resource waste since the stored energy is not used for protein/biomass biosynthesis and on the second hand as the root cause of additional process challenges especially during the harvest and the first capture steps given the hydrophobic nature of these molecules. Implementation of lipidomics analysis enables us to highlight a new type of process variability and to anticipate potential problems for the downstream steps. The application of this methodology on our platform has helped us to design tailor made solutions (pretreatment selection, filter selection,\u2026) at the clarification step which are now implemented in our harvest development platform approach. . Matriptase knock-out in CHO cells prevents clipping of recombinant proteins. a Serine protease inhibitors protect model mAb from proteolytic degradation in CHO-K1 cell derived conditioned medium. The model mAb was incubated in conditioned medium for 0h or 48h at 37\u00b0C, subsequently samples were analyzed by western blot. Broad spectrum serine protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupetin) were added during incubation. Aprotinin and Leupetin are inhibiting proteolytic degradation. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows. b Gene expression profiling of CHO-K1 versus CHO-A by NGS. Shown is the gene expression profile of \"secreted/shedded members of the S1A trypsin-like serine protease family\" for CHO-K1 and CHO-A cell lines using next generation sequencing. The gene expression analysis highlights that five proteases were more than 1.5 fold higher expressed in CHO-K1 cells (labelled with a red asterix). The y-axis shows the transcript abundance as RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). c siRNA knock-down identifies matriptase as major clipping protease and CHO matriptase KO clone shows no detectable clipping activity. Upper figure: siRNAs directed against the five protease genes and scrambled (scr.) siRNA were transfected and conditioned medium was collected three days after transfection. The model mAb was incubated in fresh medium as control (first lane) and conditioned medium from the siRNA transfected cells. Samples were analyzed by western blot. Only siRNA targeting matriptase (ST14) showed reduced proteolytic degradation. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows.

            "text": "The glycosylation of therapeutic proteins is a critical quality attribute (CQA) and needs to be analyzed during cell line and bioprocess development. The current methods for analyzing glycosylation are mainly based on the enzymatic release of glycans. They are tedious and offer only limited throughput, which makes them unsuitable for cell line development work. In this study we evaluated a novel PAIA assay for measuring intact glycoproteins with capture beads and fluorescence labeled plant lectins to analyze glycans in a high throughput 384-well plate format. Material and methods Analytes: Erbitux \u00a9 , Mabthera \u00a9 , Arzerra \u00a9 and Avastin \u00a9 . Two glycoengineered variants of one IgG were kindly provided by Merck (Vevey, Switzerland). All analytes were spiked into CHO-K1 cell culture supernatant or buffer, diluted 1:1 with a denaturation solution and incubated at 65 or 70\u00b0C for 20 minutes to expose the Fc glycans. Erbitux samples were analyzed under denaturing conditions to detect Fab-and Fc-glycosylation and in native conditions for Fab glycosylation only. 10\u03bcL of pretreated sample was added to each well of the special 384-well PAIAplate, containing labeled lectin and capture beads. The microplate was incubated for 45 minutes at 1800 rpm on an orbital shaker at room temperature and spun down at 500 xg. The read-out was done on a fluorescence microscope (SynenTec, Elmshorn, Germany) in less than five minutes. Results Figure 1a : Lectin binding profiles of different IgGs. The analysis of different IgG results in lectin binding profiles which show the different degrees in glycosylation. High abundance of sugars leads to high binding rates of the lectin for the respective sugar. Avastin has a very low degree of galactosylation and high mannose species compared to Mabthera and Arzerra (Fig. 1a) . Only Arzerra is carrying glycans with 2-6 linked sialic acids. These findings are in line with results from literature [1] . Figure 1b : Distinction between Fc and Fab glycosylation in Erbitux. Without denaturation only the Fab glycans are detectable in Erbitux. Denaturation leads to additional exposure of the Fc glycans and thus higher lectin binding rates compared to native Erbitux. GNA and NPL only bind to denatured Erbitux indicating that the high mannose glycans are only present on the Fc part. The equal SNA binding rates for both conditions confirm that the 2-6 linked sialic acids are almost exclusively found on the Fab part. This is in agreement with published data [2] . Figure 1c : Lectin binding rates correlate with the levels of galactosylation and fucosylation. Increasing degrees of glycosylation in the mixtures of the glycan variants from Merck lead to higher lectin binding rates for all galactose and fucose markers proving that quantitative analysis can be performed with these assays. The ConA lectin which binds to the common core mannose glycan motive remains at the same level, suggesting that the Fc glycans were similarly exposed in all samples.",

We believe that bead-based assays with lectins have a great potential for monitoring product quality early in the development process. Background Gene-and cell therapy-based medicines are experiencing resurgence due to the introduction of \"next generation\" transfer viral vectors, which have demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Adeno associated viruses (AAV) and lentiviruses are very commonly used in therapeutics and often produced by transient gene expression, using PEI-mediated transient transfection in HEK-293 or HEK-293T cells [1] . The critical raw materials needed for cGMP vector production must be sourced from approved suppliers and should have gone through a rigorous testing program to reduce the risk of introducing adventitious agents into the production process. Correspondingly, the PEI transfection reagent must also be sourced from a qualified supplier, and have gone through rigorous testing to ensure reliable transfection efficiencies, and hence reproducible virus production yields. Here, we present PEIpro\u00ae and PEIpro\u00ae-HQ, the unique PEI-based transfection reagents suitable for use in process development and in cGMP biomanufacturing, respectively. Unlike commercially available PEIs, PEIpro\u00ae benefits from extensive research and development in polymer chemistry and formulation for mammalian cell transfection. We further demonstrate that PEIpro\u00ae and PEIpro\u00ae-HQ are the reagents of choice for virus production runs in most cell culture systems, hence facilitating the transition from initial optimization during process development up to large-scale therapeutic viral vector production in adherent or suspension cells.",

Irrespective of the cell culture-based system and production scale, PEIpro\u00ae and PEIpro\u00ae-HQ have led to efficient viral vector yields in standard laboratory cell systems, such as in flasks, cell factories, and roller bottles, as well as in multilayers flasks or fixed-bed culture systems that take into account time and space concerns for the scaling-up process (Table 1) . For example, high viral vector yields superior to 10 7 IG/mL and 10 11 -10 12 VG/mL were obtained respectively for lentiviruses and AAVs in suspension HEK-293T and HEK-293 cells cultured in one of the commercially available synthetic cell culture medium BalanCD\u00ae HEK293 (Irvine Scientific\u00ae). Conclusion PEIpro\u00ae and its higher quality grade PEIpro\u00ae-HQ are the unique PEI suitable for efficient and reproducible production of therapeutic viral vectors. Efficient viral vector production yields can be achieved in most cell culture systems, irrespective of the production scale. With appropriate and advanced quality controls, the highest quality grade PEIpro\u00ae-HQ is commercially available to accompany academics and biopharmaceutical companies in terms of qualified raw material for their GMP-grade viral vector production needs. b Distinction between Fc and Fab glycosylation in Erbitux. Erbitux was diluted to a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/mL in TRIS buffer and measured in native and denatured conditions to distinguish Fab glycosylation (native Erbitux) from Fab and Fc glycosylation (denatured Erbitux). It could be confirmed that sialic acids are almost exclusively present on the Fab part of Erbitux and that the high mannose glycans are only found in the Fc part. c Lectin binding rates correlate with the levels of galactosylation and fucosylation. Two glycan variants samples of the same IgG from Merck were mixed in different ratios to yield glycosylation rates of 9 to 55% in terminal \u03b2-galactose and 8 to 100% in core-fucose, based on data from 2-AB UPLC analysis. The mixtures all contained 0.5 \u03bcg IgG per well. The measured lectin binding rates for all galactose and fucose markers correlate very well with the respective degree of glycosylation in the mixtures. All measurements were performed in triplicates (Irvine  Scientific\u00ae) . HEK-293T (lentivirus) and HEK-293 (AAV) cells were thawed directly into each medium and passaged every 3 to 4 days before going into a 2 Liter benchtop bioreactor.

Lentiviral and AAV titer were measured 48 and 72 hours post transfection (Data kindly provided by G\u00e9n\u00e9thon) Table 1 (abstract P-004).

This is primarily because of cost advantages such as reduced capital cost and increased product yield. The change in status of perfusion process from older perfusion to the new-age perfusion is due to availability of better cell retention devices leading to more efficient processes, improved cell lines, cell culture medium capable of supporting high cell densities and better bioreactor control strategies. In this work, we present the advantages, limitations and challenges of fed batch and perfusion type of processes through case studies. Table 1 Results",

However, with M2 membrane, product retention started only late (after 50% of batch duration) and it remained low (~20-40%). On the contrary, this difference was not observed at 1L scale due to the usage of membranes with larger filter area (2-3 folds higher compared to pilot scale).

The choice of the process format going forward should now solely be dependent on the requirement for the biologic rather than the earlier perception that fed-batch is the preferred choice because of its simplicity. Background Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture has been widely used for production of monoclonal antibodies in the pharmaceutical industry. Previous studies have shown that the cell specific productivity in CHO cells can be increased by glucose limitation [1] .

Since common cancer treatment is limited and not effective for late stage carcinoma, alternative methods are needed to reduce the high mortality rate of cancer patients. One alternative approach is the application of the oncolytic Measles virus (OMV), because OMV has a natural affinity against cancer cells. The major drawbacks of OMV is to produce the extremely high amount of at least 10 11 TCID 50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per dose [2] which is needed. To solve this problem, a high titer process must be established including an efficient downstream processing (DSP). We developed an appropriate upstream processing and are able to produce 10 10 -10 11 TCID 50 mL -1 in a bioreactor with 0.5 L working volume [3] . Now, we focus on the DSP part. The following study tested the application of charged depth filters for the OMV clarification. In contrast to common DSP schemes, a depletion of virus particles or a loss of infectivity is not desired. The aim is a reduction of protein content and DNA with minimal loss of infective OMV. Further, we investigated the influence of the cell culture medium on the depth filtration process.",

            "text": "We found that positively charged depth filters were suitable to clarify OMV suspensions. The cell culture medium, in which the OMV was produced, influenced the outcome of the depth filtration. A log reduction value (LRV) of 0.87 was determined for OMV present in serum-containing medium (SCM), whereas the titer of OMV in serumfree medium (SFM) was reduced 1.63 log levels. This indicates that without serum in the surrounding liquid, OMV will adsorb to the filter material. However, we must evaluate if the missing serum or other components present in SFM are responsible for this effect. Total protein was not relevantly reduced by the clarification using charged depth filters. For OMV present in SCM, the residual protein content was slightly less compared to OMV present in SFM (Table 1 ). In contrast, host cell DNA (hcDNA) was bound to the filter material. We achieved a 33% reduction of hcDNA for an OMV suspension in SFM. After clarifying an OMV suspension in SFM, the remaining hcDNA content was even lower being only 42 %. Conclusions Charged depth filters are suitable for the first clarification step of OMV downstream processing. Residual protein could pass the depth Scheme of the complete cell line development workflow support in Genedata Bioprocess. Showcasing integration of data from diverse measurement instruments, data visualization for decision making support as well as, tracking of full clone history filter almost unhindered, whereas the hcDNA content was already reduced to 42% at maximum. However, the OMV titer was also reduced by the depth filtration. This undesired effect was stronger for the OMV present in SFM. Because the agencies require avoiding serum in clinical-grade production processes, this is disadvantageous. Nonetheless, because SFM will be soon standard for OMV production, further experiments have to be done preventing the OMV reduction during clarification. One option can be to reduce the adsorption strength of the virus to the filter material by the addition of salt. Moreover, it is important to establish a standardized protocol for the upstream processing. We determined batch-to-batch variations within the clarification indicating a strong impact of upstream processing (USP) on the outcome of the DSP. Therefore, further studies must investigate the influence of USP parameter e.g. time of harvest and pH of the harvest solution on the OMV.",

            "text": "Fed-batch culture is commonly employed to maximize cell and product concentrations in upstream mammalian cell culture processes. Typical standard platform processes rely on fixed-volume bolus feeding of concentrated feed supplements at regular intervals. However, such static approaches might result in over-or underfeeding. To mimic more closely the dynamics of a fed-batch culture, we developed a dynamic feeding strategy responsive to the actual nutrient needs of a mAb-producing recombinant CHO cell line. Results and discussion Improvements made at different steps during fed-batch development are shown in Fig. 1 . At step 1, all eight Cell Boost supplements were added to CDM4NS0 according to a DoE approach, and batch cultures were performed. This evaluation allowed us to select only those Cell Boost supplements that were beneficial to the overall culture performance. Non-performing Cell Boost supplements were removed and not considered further. At step 2, the selected Cell Boost supplements were added daily to the cultures at different ratios according to a DoE approach, and fedbatch cultures were conducted. As expected, daily feed additions to replenish consumed nutrients substantially improved mAb and peak cell concentrations as well as viable cumulative cell days (VCCD) compared to batch cultivation. Further, the results enabled us to fine-tune the feed ratio of selected Cell Boost supplements. At step 3, we further optimized the best performing feed ratio by investigation of static and dynamic feed protocols. Most fed-batch protocols rely on constant feed additions on distinct days. However, these approaches often lead to substantial over-or underfeeding during bioprocessing. To improve such \"static\" protocols, we investigated three different \"dynamic\" approaches as shown in Table 1 by applying the selected Cell Boost supplements with the optimized feed ratio. This investigation allowed us to further improve the bioprocess performance. The best performing approaches, constant and retrospective feed, were further investigated in fully automated bioreactors under controlled conditions. In general, constant cultivation parameters in the bioreactor slightly enhanced mAb titers compared to shake flask cultivation. The retrospective feed strategy yielded 10% higher titers than the constant strategy. Overall, the established methodology for fed-batch development allowed us to obtain 2.5\u00d7 higher mAb titers (batch mean: 1.9 g/L vs. fed-batch 4.9 g/L) in a short time and three simple steps. In addition, the product quality was investigated. Compared to the legacy fedbatch process, fed-batches that were conducted with the newly selected basal and feed media altered the distribution of charge and glycan variants. The amount of aggregated product was not altered.",

On day seven, a sharp decline in viability indicated the end of the batch process (Fig. 1a) . In feed-spiked medium, cells initially grew slower but reached almost twice as high peak cell concentrations (17.6 \u00d7 10 6 c/mL) than in basal medium only (9.79 \u00d7 10 6 c/mL). Remarkably, the integral of the viable cell concentration over the total process time (viable cumulative cell days [VCCD] ) was similar between both process strategies (Fig. 1c) . While mAb production plateaued after Day 4 in basal medium only (final titer 0.8 g/L), a continuous increase to three-fold higher final titers (2.4 g/L) was observed in feed-spiked medium (Fig. 1b) . The higher titers could be attributed to generally higher cell-specific productivities (qP), which remained rather constant (~70 pg/cell/day) in feedspiked cultures. In basal medium, the qP continuously dropped by 20% (Day 0 to 3), 50% (Day 4), and > 90% (Day 5 to 7) from 70 to 10 pg/cell/day in basal medium cultures. In average, the qP was 70% higher in feed-spiked cultures (Fig. 1d ). Transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes between cells grown in basal medium or feed-spiked medium were used to identify relevant GO terms that indicated a more active proliferative state for feed-spiked cultures (data not shown). The top GO terms significantly related to cell cycle and primary metabolism, cellular division, as well as nucleobase formation or regulation. Furthermore, GSEA revealed several significantly enriched set of genes related to gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, cell growth and proliferation, as well as inhibition of apoptosis in feed-spiked cultures. Thus, feed-spiking increased the proliferative activity of cultivated cells. Several of the identified genes appear as promising targets for cell line engineering, but have not yet been described in relation to high-producing recombinant cell lines and will need to be evaluated in future studies.",

In this study, rounds of upstream and downstream processes were run to reach the CQA limits of the originator molecule. After conducting many different development strategies, the mirror plot images of the intact deconvoluted mass were found to be identical corresponding to similar levels of glycoforms. The UV chromatogram of reversed phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) of tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that the primary structure of TUR01 is identical to the originator as shown in Fig. 1a . Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as oxidation, deamidation, N-terminal pyroglutamic acid, C-terminal lysine truncation levels were also comparable for two products. The glycosylation site (HC-Asn301) was confirmed by peptide mapping analysis and 100% glycan site occupancy was proven for TUR01 and originator. The glycosylation pattern for two products were highly similar in terms of major glycans (G0F, G1F, G0F-GN and etc.). Man5 level was lower in TUR01 compared to the originator product which may not have any clinical effect on the molecule. The secondary structure was determined by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Absorption bands (Amide I and Amide II) were overlapped completely and amounts of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures were comparable. Furthermore; size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis revealed that both products have the same level of purity (>99%) and aggregate (<1%) levels. The level of impurities were determined as below 4% by CE-SDS. The capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) experiments showed that the charge variant profiles of two products are indistinguishable and the isoelectric point of main peak is observed at 8.3 for both products. The association/dissociation rate constants and binding affinity for both TUR01 and originator were highly similar and similarity score was calculated greater than 99%, as shown in Fig. 1b .",

Here we focus on protein glycosylation as one important indication for product quality [1] . During a batch process conditions change continuously. At the beginning, the supply situation for the cell is excellent, but the secreted material stays a long time in the culture fluid.

In both cases the degree is highest in the first phase. An incomplete galactosylation leads to truncated glycans. This leads inevitable to undersialylated antennas to be seen for \u03b11-Antitrypsin.

Transient gene expression offers a rapid approach to the production of numerous recombinant proteins for the initial-stage developments of biologics. Mammalian cells are major host cells for transient gene expression, but they have the disadvantages of complicated operations and high cost of culture. Insect cells are easy to handle and can be grown to a high cell density in suspension with a serum-free medium. Insect cells can also produce large amount of recombinant proteins through post-translational processing and modifications of higher eukaryotes.

The alkali buffer addition necessary for maintaining the pH set-point is an on-line reliable and easy measuring variable that provides information about by-products formation (mainly lactic acid). The monitoring of this variable can provide information about the cell concentration, activity and metabolism, to detect changes in culture. Besides that, a relationship between alkali buffer addition and VCD can be established since the first is strongly correlated with cell growth and metabolites consumption/formation. The application of alkali buffer addition measure to implement an optimal feeding strategy in fed-batch permits to enhance VCD and product titer when comparing with batch strategies.",

Continuous manufacturing is growing in the field and is encouraged by health authorities [1, 2, 3] . This work addresses scale down limitations inherent to continuous media exchange and cell retention by using a semi-continuous system. Data was generated with a set of different clones that were previously studied in fed-batch mode [4] . Materials and methods 4 CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the same monoclonal antibody (mAb) and issued from the same transfection were used as models. 3.5L bioreactors (Sartorius) were used for fed-batch and perfusion production runs. The perfusion bioreactors were run using an alternating tangential flow filtration device (Repligen, XCell\u2122 ATF 2 System). The cell biomass was controlled by removing cells through a bleed line and was controlled using a biocapacitance probe (Hamilton, Incyte). The perfusion rate (D) was fixed to one vessel volume a day (vvd -1 ). The semi-continuous runs were made in 50 mL shake tube (TPP, TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactor 50). Once a day, the tubes were centrifuged (5 min, 200 g), the supernatant removed (to mimic a perfusion rate of 1 vvd -1 ), replaced with fresh media and cells were re-suspended.",

This value was compared to the CSPR obtained during the 4 th set-point (SP4) of the perfusion runs. As expected, the bleed fraction decreased when the capacitance set-point was increased and went down to 5% or less of the total perfusion rate (data not shown). Since the bleed removes the excess biomass, it is an indication of how close to a limitation the system is. Therefore, the CSPR calculated at SP4 was considered as the minimum CSPR. The CSPR min obtained in both systems were very close ( Table 1 ). The semi-continuous system can therefore be used to identify the CSPR min before running a continuous bioreactor, it therefore facilitates the decision making early in the development (to define the target cell density for a defined perfusion rate). The specific productivity (Q p ) of the 4 clones was quantified at the maximum VCD (semi-continuous) or at SP4 (perfusion). Absolute values are not representative since the cell environment is so different in both systems. Nevertheless, a relative ranking proved to be indicative of the respective performances ( Table 1 ). The maximum cell growth in fed-batch, semi-continuous and perfusion were also compared, their ranking was always preserved.

Tan The production of therapeutic antibodies (Abs) requires high titers and excellent product quality to ensure efficient manufacturing and potent drug efficacy. Glycosylation, or the attachment of sugars to organic molecules, is a critical quality aspect that can significantly alter Ab binding, function, and therapeutic effect [1] . Galactose is a key sugar of interest due to its significant impact on Ab function and the ability to control galactosylation through cell culture medium. Herein, Irvine Scientific assessed the ability of media components to modulate galactose levels on a model therapeutic Ab. Various media compositions were able to modulate galactosylation levels without compromising cell growth and Ab titers. In addition, an in vitro assay was utilized to evaluate the functional ability of Abs to bind and activate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Differences in galactosylation significantly altered the Abs' ability to induce cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, design of experiment analysis determined the optimal ratio of supplements to maximize galactosylation. This \"Optimized Supplement\" was verified and evaluated against other suppliers' galactosylation supplements in terms of growth, titer, glycan analysis, and Ab function. The Optimized Supplement outperformed all other suppliers' supplements and resulted in the best overall cell growth, titer, galactosylation, and Ab function.",

The final catalog medium showed significant improvements in productivity across all cell lines, with reduced CSPRs when compared to enriched fed-batch medium or initial prototypes (Table 1) . There is a rising demand for accelerated process development, increased efficiency and economics for biopharmaceutical production processes. Furthermore, increased process understanding have evolved from the Process Analytical Tool initiative (PAT) and the Quality by Design (QbD) methodology. In contrast to one-factor-at-atime methods, statistical Design of Experiment (DoE) methods are widely used to develop biopharmaceutical processes. Even if highthroughput systems can handle these numbers of experiments in parallel, the heuristic restriction of boundaries and the high number of factors results in stepwise iterations with multiple runs. Therefore, the combination of model-based simulations with DoE methods (mDoE) for the development of sophisticated cell culture processes is a novel tool for process development [1] . It is used to reduce the number of experiments during DoE and the time needed for the development of more knowledge-based cell culture processes. This concept was applied to the optimization of the initial glutamine and glucose concentrations of a CHO batch process.",

N-linked glycan analysis by anion exchange and hydrophilic interaction HPLC showed that the proportion of highly sialylated (di-, tri-, tetra-) and tetra-antennary N-linked glycans was significantly decreased upon hyperosmotic culture. Addition of betaine, an osmoprotectant, to the hyperosmotic culture significantly increased the proportion of highly sialylated and tetra-antennary N-linked glycans (P \u2264 0.05), while it increased the expression of the N-glycan branching/antennary genes (mgat2 and mgat4b). Thus, decreased expression of the genes with roles in the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway correlated with reduced sialic acid content of Fc-fusion protein caused by hyperosmolar conditions. Conclusions Taken together, the results obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the detrimental effects of hyperosmolality on N-glycosylation, especially sialylation, in rCHO cells. The identified genes, particularly mgat2 and mgat4b, are potential targets for engineering in CHO cells to overcome the impact of hyperosmolality on glycoprotein sialylation.",

A special focus is on the analysis of data from micro-and bench-top bioreactors (such as the ambr15\u2122 and DasGip\u2122 systems) operated in parallel. These bioreactors allow for increased throughput of clone selection and process optimization studies, which in turn leads to an increase in data generation. Genedata Bioprocess supports integration with such systems and enables a comparison of data regardless of the instrument provider or scale. Automated bioreactor data analysis allows development groups to take advantage of even richer datasets and, as data management is built-in to the system, the data can be easily tracked and associated to historical records. Another focus is on cross-reactor scale comparisons. Data coming from different bioreactor scales can be easily imported into the platform and analyzed to establish the best conditions for upscaling. Genedata Bioprocess enables the correlation of process parameters (e.g., fermentation protocols, media recipes, bioreactor control parameters), with key performance indicators of the processes (e.g., Titer, qP) and the product quality attributes (e.g., aggregation, glycosylation profiles). Finally, bioreactor time course data can be tracked together with clone analytics and product quality parameters, which makes the platform uniquely able to support end-to-end biopharma development. Upstream bioprocesses are at particular risk of contamination from adventitious agents. The typical 0.1 \u03bcm filters used at this step protect bioreactors from bacteria and mycoplasma but offer no protection from viral contaminations. A new polyethersulfone (PES) upstream virus filter, Viresolve\u00ae Barrier, has demonstrated high levels of microorganism retention -full retention for bacteria and mycoplasma (>8.0 LRV -Log Reduction Value) and~5 LRV for small viruses, such as parvoviruses. It also has improved flow and capacity as compared to virus removal filters designed for monoclonal antibody purification. Given the small pore size of virus retentive filters, implementing a virus filter upstream of the bioreactor raises the question of whether critical cell culture media components are removed. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the cell culture performance and protein quality attributes using virus-filtered media to ensure that filtration does not negatively impact the process. Materials and methods EX-CELL\u00ae CHO media and corresponding feeds were processed through either Viresolve\u00ae Barrier filters or 0.22 \u03bcm filters (control). Media composition post-filtration was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma/ optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Recombinant CHO cells were cultured in fed batch culture. Cell density and viability were measured by Vi-Cell TM cell viability analyzer while metabolites were analyzed by BioProfile\u00ae FLEX analyzer. Shake flasks and bioreactors were utilized to verify that surfactants, such as poloxamer, (which are essential for shear protection in stirred tank bioreactors and can be difficult to filter) have not been removed during filtration.",

To increase efficiency in R&D processes and reduce costs, organizations need to evaluate potential drug candidates earlier in the R&D process, eliminate those with undesirable characteristics, and focus on the most promising candidates. After designing and thorough testing of successful candidates, efficient production of new biological entities in mammalian cell lines is necessary. The main goal here is to find a suitable cell line and optimal upstream and downstream processing conditions that not only lead to a satisfactory product yield, but also to a product with the desired biochemical properties. The evaluation of production cell lines, processes, and product quality attributes is performed earlier and in higher throughput for an increasing number of drug candidates. In addition, new methods in molecular and cell biology (e.g., novel genome engineering approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9), in analytics [e.g., Process Analytical Techniques (PATs)], in process miniaturization, and in automation promise to make process development more efficient. However, the management and analysis of the increasing amount of experimental data during candidate selection and cell line and process development has become a bottleneck. In addition, quality-compromising steps in biopharma organizations can negatively impact the cost of goods and substantially prolong the drug candidate's time to market. Therefore, systems for integrated management and analysis of wellstructured and curated data that comprehensively integrate molecule and sample information, manufacturing process parameters, and process and product quality attributes are needed.

The specific consumption rate of glucose was significantly increased by the glucose increase from 20 to 40mM and reduced by MH (Fig.  1c) . At 0.010 (h -1 ) the specific production rate of lactate (q Lac ) was increased by glucose increase, independent of the culture temperature used. While at 33\u00b0C/0.018(h -1 ) the q Lac decreased with increasing glucose concentration and at 37\u00b0C/0.018(h -1 ) a maximum consumption was observed at 30 mM glucose (Fig. 1d) . The lactate-glucose yield ( Fig. 1e ) not showed relevant changes at 0.010(h -1 ), while at 0.018(h -1 ) this yield showed a more efficient utilization of glucose, as glucose concentration was increased.

Background Mammalian cell cultures are the most commonly used bioprocess for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Facing to the increasing demand of these biopharmaceuticals, the FDA has initiated the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) framework in order to encourage pharmaceutical industries to use innovative technologies to monitor in real time the critical process parameters (CPPs), and to ensure the final product quality [1] . One of the most important CPPs for cell culture bioprocesses is the specific growth rate (\u03bc), which is a direct indicator of cellular physiological state. Indeed, \u03bc is sensible to culture conditions and its value decreases when cells are in the unfavourable environment for growth [2] , which may greatly influence mAb production and quality. However, until this day, the online monitoring of \u03bc remains a great challenge for mammalian cell culture bioprocesses.",

Then, a model of online estimation of \u03bc was developed based on VCD prediction and cell mass balance equations. Several signal noise filters and various calculation methods were evaluated to reach better model stability. Cell cultures were performed in both batch and feed-harvest modes.

Model of online estimation of \u03bc was developed from cultures in batch mode, and was validated by comparing online estimated \u03bc with the experimental ones calculated at the end of the culture. With this model, the moment when \u03bc started to decrease significantly, which indicated that cells were no longer in the exponential growth phase, was identified as the critical moment. To demonstrate the interest of online estimation of \u03bc, the developed model was applied to a feedharvest culture, where the medium renewals were performed at the critical moments indicated by the model. This culture was then compared with the traditional feed-harvest culture where medium renewals were performed by following offline measurements of glucose and glutamine. We found that the online strategy allowed to maintain the value of \u03bc by renewing the medium at the right time, while the values of \u03bc varied a lot when using offline strategy. Moreover, by using the online estimation of \u03bc, the glycosylation of IgG was kept at a high level (about 95%) throughout the whole culture. However, for the culture using offline strategy, the glycosylation level decreased progressively and was only about 75% at the end of the culture (Fig. 1) .",

We have now developed an efficient method for generating single glycoforms by solid phase re-modelling which is superior to previous methods because it allows a sequential series of enzymatic changes without the need for intermediate purification of the antibody.

This included a distribution of FG0, FG1, FG2, FS1 and FS2 with galactosylation indices ranging from 0.22 for IL8 to 0.64 for EG2. There was minimal sialylation in IL8 but up to 11% in EG2. Glycan modifications were made as each antibody was held on a Protein A column in accordance with procedures shown in Table  1 . Agalactosylated glycans were enriched by treatment with the single addition of galactosidase and neuraminidase. This resulted in 83-95% of agalactosylated structures in the Mabs and 65% in the polyclonal antibody. Galactosylated antibodies (>95% yield) were produced by a single stage reaction involving sialidase and by galactosyltransferase with UDP-Gal. Breakdown of the glycans to a trimannosyl core was accomplished by treatment of the agalactosylated structures with hexosaminidase. This produced a yield of 76-80% of the FM3 structure with a small remainder of FA1. Sialylated antibodies (>95%) were produced by a 2 stage reaction involving sialidase, galactosyltransferase and finally treatment with 2,6 sialyltransferase in the presence of CMP-NANA. The latter reaction produced equimolar quantities of monosialylated and disialylated Cetuximab and polyclonal antibodies. The results suggest that for human antibodies (150 kDa) there may be a limitation for sialylation given the steric constraints between the two CH2 domains of the dimeric structure. The ability to sialylate the smaller camelid antibody (80 kDa) was greater resulting in a high (>90%) level of disialylated glycans. This suggests that the steric constraints for glycosylation may be lower. These sialylated antibodies have significant potential clinical importance for their ant-inflammatory activities.",

This allows enzymatic transformation in a solid state that has a distinct advantage over the equivalent transformation in solution because the enzymes and buffers can be washed out on completion of the modification leaving the antibody still attached to the affinity ligand. This enables repeated rounds of an enzymatic reaction or sequential reaction steps without the need for intermediate antibody purification. The antibody can be removed eventually from the column by application of an elution buffer once all desired glycan modification have been made. Since affinity ligand purification of antibodies is performed routinely as an initial step of purification after cell culture, the glycan modification can easily be incorporated into this process. The enrichment of the resulting antibody for a targeted glycoform can enhance the potential therapeutic efficacy as it is known that specific glycoforms are required for certain biological effects. [1, 2] . This is mainly because microvesicles can be enriched/deprived for specific proteins, based on their functional purpose and their cellular origin. Recently, microvesicles purified from the supernatant of T24 bladder cancer cells were reported to be enriched for Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 (anti-apoptotic proteins), but deprived for Bax and caspase-3 proteins (pro-apoptotic proteins) contributing towards immunity against programmed cell-death [2] . However, impact of microvesicles on CHO-based bioprocess has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, in this investigation, we aimed to evaluate their impact on cell growth and recombinant protein production from CHO cells. Materials and methods CHO-K1 cells were grown in chemically-defined protein-free culture medium (Life Technologies-1835273) in shake flask (GX-00125P). The different fractions of spent-media (microvesicles and microvesicle-free spent media) were collected using ultracentrifugation method [1, 3] . Quality of different fractions was ensured using Western blotting for exosomal marker, CD63 (SC-15363) and coomassie stained gel for loading control (Fig. 1a) . To evaluate impact on cell growth, cells were seeded with microvesicles and microvesicle-free fraction collected from log-phase of culture and cell counts were performed by ViCell using trypan-blue dye exclusion method. For impact on productivity, cell-free supernatant, collected from microvesicle-treated human IgG secreting CHO culture from stationary-phase of culture with respective control, was evaluated using ELISA (ab100547).

The viability of microvesicle-supplemented cultures, similar to microvesicle-free media supplemented, was also higher compared to standard culture suggesting potential use of microvesicles for regulating CHO growth in production cultures. This could be possibily because microvesicles have already been reported to be enriched with cell growth/death-regulating proteins and hence facilitating cell growth [2, 3] . We have also observed abundance of cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 in microvesicle-fraction compared to microvesicle-free spent-media in our laboratory (data not shown); however, further investigation are required to prove the hypothesis. The overall productivity of human IgG secreting CHO cells was also observed to increase b\u1ef9 4 fold following supplementation of microvesicles to the culture without significantly affecting per-cell productivity. Since microvesicle-supplementation facilitates cell growth, increased number of viable producer cells in the culture could be expected to be the basis of observed increase in the overall productivity of the culture [2, 3] . The further work is ongoing to in-depth explore the potential of microvesicles for improving recombinant protein production from CHO cells.",

Therefore, strategies need to be developed for sterile isolation of CHO microvesicles from routine maintenance cultures and their supplementation into the production culture for improving the performance of CHO-based production process. The glycosylation profile of a recombinant protein is one of the most important attributes when defining product quality. Producing a protein with desired characteristics requires the ability to modify and target specific glycosylation profiles. Traditionally the approach to modify the glycosylation profile of a protein involves supplementing a culture with components that can improve galactosylation. Experimentation using this supplemental approach resulted in a dramatic increase in terminal galactosylation, but lacked the ability to easily and repeatedly target specific glycosylation profiles. Using novel and proprietary technology, we have developed a feed (GlycanTune\u2122) and a unique feeding process that will maximize growth and titer while being able to modulate glycan profiles. This new feed can be added as a standalone process that can result in a significant shift from G0F to G1F and G2F (maximum galactosylation). Using a unique fed-batch process, GlycanTune can also be used with a standard feed to dial in targeted glycosylation profiles. Through process development, we created a method where a transition point is used to switch from a standard feed to a glycan modulating feed. The timing of the transition point will determine the specificity of the glycan profile. ) .

The use of a strong chelator led to a high transfection efficiency, but impaired cell growth. Based on the results of the independent substance testings, the medium formulation was modified by the addition of a weak chelator and further components including vitamins. Different osmolalities between 280 mOsmol/kg and 340 mOsmol/kg were tested for the final formulation, but no major impact was seen neither on transfection efficiency nor on viability 2 days post-transfection.

One major advantage of these polyelectrolyte microcapsules (<1 mm) is the low MWCO (<10 kDa) (Fig. 1a-b) . This restricted permeability allows for a conditioning of the capsule core by autocrine factors, which in turn permits the use of basal cell culture medium instead of expensive T cell specialized media, hence does not necessitate high amounts of rhIL-2 and reduces the cultivation costs. Moreover, co-encapsulation of rhIL-2 had a beneficial effect on the growth kinetics in most cases (Fig. 1c) . Some evidence is presented that the SCS used to form the polyelectrolyte microcapsules, specifically adsorbs IL-2 (Table 1 ) -A cytokine which provides an essential signal for T-cell proliferation and differentiation [3] . Therefore, we postulate that the SCS used for encapsulation has biomimetic properties, creating an artificial extracellular matrix mimicking heparin sulfate which in turn positively affect T cell proliferation via trans-presentation of IL-2 (Fig. 1d) [4] .",

DM is a resident and on-line source of continuous optimization of process performance. It relies upon the comprehensive, real-time interfacing of both human and machine sourced information through one centralized system. More than legacy Distributed Control System (DCS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), it is an integral interconnection of real-time access to divergent sources of information. As such, it can promise deep analysis and predictions leading to shortened product cycle and advanced process control.

Once the limits have been defined, the approach is quite straightforward and usable by nonstatistician. However, such strategy, as any other of this type, must be based on a sufficient number of batches for the definition of the control limits in order to have a good estimation of the batch-to batch variability.

As there is not an efficacious treatment available, post-exposure vaccination is recommended for individuals in contact with the virus. On the other hand, the most common source of virus transmission is saliva of infected animals, mostly dogs, whereby mass vaccination of pets is the most cost-effective way to reduce human infections. In this context, availability of both human and veterinary vaccines is critical [2, 3] . Our group had previously developed an effective VLP-based rabies vaccine candidate produced in high density HEK293 cell cultures with serum free medium (SFM) [4, 5] . One of the aims in vaccine production process is the achievement of a good productivity with a low cost per dose, mainly in the case of vaccines for animal use in which case the SFM is one of the principal expenses. In this work, we show the adaptation of the producer clone to a non-expensive in-house developed culture medium, in order to reduce the global cost of the process and therefore the price per dose. Experimental approach First, we compared a direct and a sequential adaptation protocol of our HEK293 RV-VLPs producer clone, from 100% of the commercial SFM (EX-CELL293, SAFC) to a new formulation with only 50% of the SFM and a minimum essential medium (P2G), developed in our laboratory specifically for RV-VLPs production. This new formulation was called RVPM (Rabies Vaccine Production Medium). The specific productivity of RV-VLPs in culture supernatants was measured by sandwich ELISA, using the 6 th International Standard for rabies vaccine that quantify the glycoprotein content (NIBSC, expressed in ELISA Units per ml). Further, we evaluated both media for the production of the rabies vaccine, using stirred tank bioreactors operated in continuous mode (BIOSTAT QPlus, Sartorius). The production of the RV-VLPs was daily evaluated by ELISA and the obtained harvests analysed by the NIH potency test for rabies vaccine.",

A lower maximum cell density with the RVPM was reached, achieving 5x10 6 cells.ml -1 , compared with the SFM that reach cell densities between 8 and 9x10 6 cells.ml -1 in batch mode. The specific RV-VLPs productivity per cell was maintained, obtaining values of 0.88 and 0.90 EU.10 6 cells -1 .day -1 for the clone being cultured in SFM and RVPM, respectively. Taking into account that this producer clone can be changed directly from one medium to the other without lag phase or cell damage, and that in RVPM the maximum cell density reached was lower, this medium was proposed to be analysed in high cell density in perfusion mode for a continuous culture in bioreactor. Therefore, we performed two cultures in parallel to compare the efficacy of each media formulation in perfusion. As shown in Fig. 1 , we obtained very similar culture performances in both bioreactors; 14.4 EU.ml -1 and 16.1 EU.ml -1 of RV-VLPs for the commercial SFM and RVPM, respectively. After that, the harvests were evaluated by the NIH potency test obtaining a rabies vaccine potency of 1.2 IU.ml -1 for both cultures (being 1 IU.ml -1 the minimum potency required for animal vaccine). Thus, the results obtained represent an interesting advance in the optimization of this vaccine production process since the use of this new medium formulation represents a reduction of 40% of the total cost which will be reflected in a considerable reduction of the price of the vaccine dose. Background Vaccines are one of the most powerful and effective health inventions ever developedproviding tremendous economic and societal value; yet several factors hinder comprehensive immunization coverage. Traditional methods of biologics production, based on stainless steel bioreactors, allow pharmaceutical companies to achieve economy of scale, but are limited by high capital expenditures. Such approaches stifle manufacturing innovation and lack long-term cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Current innovations can cut biologics' production costs to revolutionize the mainstream use of biologic treatments, focusing on developing fast, potent and cost-effective vaccine production. Univercells' mission to make biologics affordable to all initiated a paradigm shift, targeting an innovative single-use manufacturing platform incorporating bioprocess into continuous operations. Univercells employs process intensification, using high volumetric productivity bioreactors; and unit steps integration, coupling USP and DSP into continuous operations. The objective is a down-scaled high-productivity process for a cost-effective manufacturing solution. The resulting micro-facilities are easily-deployable in developing countries, breaking entry barriers to biomanufacturing (Fig. 1) .",

MVA-CR19 was also found to differ from wildtype MVA by a recombination between left and right viral telomere. Due to this event, several genes encoded at the left terminus have been deleted whereas the gene dosis of those originally encoded only at the right terminus may have increased. We do not currently know how much the various point mutations and changes in genomic structure combine to explain the improved replication of MVA-CR19. As several of the affected genes have been reported in the literature to impact interaction of MVA with the host we would expect that in vivo studies may reveal additional novel properties of MVA-CR19. An extremely important distinction between our earlier study [3] and this one concerns the source of the viruses. Here, we investigated plaque-purified viruses and confirm the high genetic and genomic stability of MVA. Different expression cassettes inserted into deletion site III, all diagnostic RFLPs and PCRs over various sites of the genome and within the viral telomeres remained unchanged throughout at least 20 serial passages -independent of whether recombinant viruses with wildtype or CR19-derived backbones were characterized. Fig. 1 (abstract P-225) . a One hallmark of MVA-CR19 is a significantly reduced tendency to induce syncytia and an increased dispersion of plaques in CR.pIX cell monolayers. This property appears to be supported by the mutation in A34R. b Electron microscopy reveals no obvious differences between novel genotype and wildtype. Background Transient gene expression systems using polyethylenimine (PEI) are considered to be fast, flexible and cost-efficient for recombinant protein production [1] . Transfection efficiency depends on different factors; one of them is the type of media. Production media support cell growth and protein production but not high transfection efficiency (TE) mediated by PEI [2] . Therefore, media were selected for transfection followed by feeding of production media [3] to improve TE and protein production. Two different transfection strategies are compared: conventional transfection by preparing polyplex of a plasmid (pDNA) and PEI interaction before transfection and insitu transfection by direct addition both of them to the cell suspension and the polyplex formed spontaneously [4] .",

Further optimization results show that the transfection of CHO-K1 cells in Opti-MEM (transfection medium) for 5 hours followed by addition of CHO-MACS CD (production medium) for further enhancing the transfection, cell count, and cell viability. The transfection efficiency (TE) increased up to 85 \u00b1 2.6% coincide with increases in viable cell concentration (VCC) in comparsion to transfection and cultivation in Opti-MEM media alone Fig. 1a . Both conventional and insitu methods are successfully transfected CHO-K1 to the same similar high TE as shown in fluorescence microscope images of Fig. 1b . Insitu transfection shows super-priority for suspension cell transfection concerning the reduction of handling steps (one step) compared to the conventional way (two steps).

Indeed, we observed that keeping the expression OFF during selection enabled the generation of pools with superior productivity compared with the pools whose expression was maintained ON.

With increasing pressure to shorten timelines and to improve drug safety, technologically advanced methods have to be established to ensure that production cell lines are derived from a single progenitor cell. Sartorius Stedim Cellca's single cell cloning approach is based on one round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using Becton Dickinson (BD) FACSAriaTM Fusion cell sorter combined with photodocumentation by SynenTec Cellavista microscopic imaging system. For the approach, critical process parameters such as different cell lines, viability and cell aggregation levels were investigated separately to assess their contribution to the probability of monoclonality. Immediately after single cell cloning into 384-well plates (1 cell/ well) the plates were centrifuged followed by imaging using the Cellavista (day 0).

Using these results, the probability of obtaining a monoclonal cell by using Sartorius Stedim Cellca's single cell cloning approach was determined (Table 1) by Conservative examination: P(monoclonal, conservative) = 1 -(P(d) x P(i)) Realistic examination: P(monoclonal, realistic) = 1 -(P(d) x P(k)) Cell pools with low viability can theoretically impact the probability of monoclonality by e.g. diminishing microscopic imaging quality (cell debris). Therefore, pool cell line 1 with very low viability (\u226536 %) was used to demonstrate, that the probability of monoclonality is still 99.9 % in case of low viability on day of sorting: P(monoclonal, conservative) = P(d) x P(i) = 99.9 % P(monoclonal, realistic) = P(d) x P(k) = 99.9 % Furthermore, cell pools with high aggregation levels can theoretically impact the probability of monoclonality by sticking together during FACS sorting and therefore increase the probability P(d) of having \u2265 2 cells/droplet. Therefore, pool cell line 8 with high aggregation levels (\u226511.1 %) was used to demonstrate, that the probability of monoclonality is still \u2265 99.9 % in case of highly aggregated cell pools on day of sorting: P(monoclonal, conservative) = P(d) x P(i) = > 99.9 % P(monoclonal, realistic) = P(d) x P(k) = > 99.9 % Conclusions In summary, there is no obvious correlation between protein product type and the determined probabilities for monoclonality. Furthermore, pools with a viability as low as 36 % and pools with an aggregation level as high as 11.1 % can be used for SCC resulting in acceptable probabilities of monoclonality. Background ICH guidance [1] requires that any cell line used to produce biopharmaceuticals originates from a single progenitor cell. Recently, there has been increased scrutiny of the method(s) used to achieve this requirement. Here, we review the suitability of the legacy capillary aided cell cloning (CACC) method in light of this changing landscape of expectations. The CACC method is based on the 'spotting' technique [2] and relies on independent visual conformation by two scientists of the presence of a single cell in a 1 \u03bcL droplet. This method achieves a high probability of monoclonality in one cloning round. Although the method has since been replaced by FACS single cell deposition for routine use, it remains a viable cloning method.",

A stronger promoter resulting in overabundance of HC, known to be toxic to cells, provides a possible explanation for the poor results with this vector. Interestingly, swapping the positions of the LC and HC in #37 resulted in a vector, #77, that outperformed the initially identified lead vector (Fig. 1 ). This same change was made to vector #39 without any resulting improvement in titers (vector #78, Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, vector #39 had a smaller difference in relative promoter strengths, based on mean channel fluorescence ratio of GFP to RFP, suggesting that overabundance of HC was not an impediment to IgG1 expression from #39. Poor titers were also seen with a modified version of vector #39 (vector #79, Fig. 1 ) in which the glutamine synthethase selection cassette was in the reverse orientation. This second screen identified vector #77 as the lead vector design (Fig. 1) .

Background Traditional cell line engineering strategies mainly include an antibiotics resistance selection. In this process, cells are transfected with the GoI (gene of interest) together with an antibiotics resistance gene and those cells are selected that survive treatment with the respective antibiotic [1] . Although the gene responsible for the survival of the cell is transfected together with the GoI, resistance is not necessarily linked to high GoI expression. Thus, a significant proportion of resistant cells may not express the GoI at all, necessitating the search for alternative, more closely linked selection systems. siRNAs (silencing inducing RNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that can bind to complementary mRNA and inhibit their translation. This function has been used in many approaches to silence the expression of certain genes [2] . With their short length, siRNAs can be hidden in introns (non-translating regions) of genes, making it possible to couple the expression of a siRNA to a gene. This way a cell produces a correlating amount of siRNA when transcribing the gene, without adding any further translational burden on the cell. The co-expression of the siRNA can be used as a selective marker by one of the following methods: (1) Knock-down of a suicide gene to enable a cell's survival after suicide gene mRNA transfection, (2) down-regulation of a surface marker which is used in MACS (magnetic cell separation) to filter out wanted or unwanted cells, and (3) inhibition of a fluorophore marker for selection using FACS without product specific antibodies.",

            "text": "Conclusions The novel selection system should speed up cell line development, as the system kills rapidly and directly selects for cells transcribing the product gene on a high level. We expect to see more high producers earlier in the process, which will allow for an easier and faster selection in the following steps. siRNA based selection offers great opportunities. By directly selecting based on GoI transcription and not a proxy marker, we expect more relevant cells on a pool level. In addition, the elimination of an antibiotics resistance allows more cellular resources for GoI production. The system offers multiple ways of application, either by enriching wanted, or depleting unwanted cells. Background Single-cell cloning is an essential step used in the upstream development of transformed cell lines for therapeutic protein production. While single-cell clones are typically used to ensure product consistency, such low cell density cultures present a survival challenge; cells grow more slowly or may even not survive at low densities in protein-free media, costing the industry time and money and limiting the pool of candidate colonies for choice of production clones [1, 2] . To address this problem, we aimed to develop a highly efficient serum-free medium suitable for optimising single-cell cloning efficiency by studying a range of conditioned media (CM) samples isolated from different Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Materials and methods CHO-S, DG44 and CHO-K1 were adapted to CHO-S SFM-II (Gibco) medium for a minimum of three passages. Conditioned media was then collected when the cultures reached a cell density of 1x10 6 cells/ml (typically day 2-day 3 depending on the growth profiles of each cell line and whether they grew in suspension or attached conditions). Samples were then centrifuged twice to remove cell pellet/debris and stored at -20\u00b0C. The ability of conditioned media to support CHO colony formation was then assayed using 96-well plates, seeding the cells at low cell density (1-10cells/well) by diluting down CHO cultures in media/conditioned media. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 10 days, cloning efficiency was assayed using a standard XTT assay. Initial screening of the nine CM samples was performed using CHO-K1 cells due to their widespread use in industrial antibody production. Successful media candidates were subsequently screened using additional CHO cell lines. Table 1) . The K1-SFMII-CM product improved cell cloning efficiency for DG44 cells (avg. increase>1.5-fold) and CHO-S cells (avg. increase>3-fold) ( Fig. 1) and also the adherent CHO-K1 cell line growing in ATCC +5%FBS.",

The main rate-limiting step in the upstream stages of protein biomanufacture is the isolation of stable, high producing cell clones. Ubiquitous Chromatin Opening Elements (UCOE\u00aes) consist of at least one promoter region with associated methylation-free CpG island from housekeeping genes; they possess a dominant chromatin opening capability and thus confer stable transgene expression. UCOE\u00ae-viral promoter (e.g. CMV) based plasmid vectors markedly reduce the time it takes to isolate high, stably producing cell clones.

In the last 20 years, growing number of innovator biologics and biosimilars have formed a competitive environment, where speed and efficiency of generating robust and highly productive cell lines needs to be improved continuously. Through various advances, especially in media development and process optimization, product titers as high as 10 g/L were achieved in the pharmaceutical industry (Kim et al., 2012) for standard products such as monoclonal antibodies. Nevertheless, other proteins e.g. bispecific antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins or Fab-related products are difficult-to-express (DTE) in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and may result in delays or even in termination of the cell line development process. We developed a new robust pool generation approach (CLD 2.0) addressing both, easy-and difficult-to-express molecules, while reducing timelines down to 5 months (CLD standard = 6 months), improving reliability of cell line development as well as clearly increasing obtained titers.",

Therefore, cells with low copies of target gene integrated in high yield sites could be an ideal production cells for manufacturing.

During the first phase both cell lines produced large amounts of lactate as a consequence of the high glucose consumption rates. Interestingly, when pH dropped below 6.8, due to acid lactic secretion and accumulation, a second metabolic phase was identified, in which concomitant consumption of glucose and lactate was observed even during the exponential growth phase. Conversely, hybridoma cells were unable to co-consume lactate and glucose simultaneously even under noncontrolled pH conditions. Therefore, the hybridoma physiological data used for the FBA corresponded to only phase 1 of pHcontrolled cultures. A summary of the main cell growth and metabolic parameters obtained from the different experiments performed is presented in Table 1 . FBA shows ( Fig. 1 for HEK293 cell culture) that lactate is produced in phase 1 because pyruvate has to be converted to lactate to fulfill the NADH regeneration in the cytoplasm and only a small amount of pyruvate can be transported into TCA through Acetyl-CoA. Cell metabolism in phase 1 is highly inefficient, as the majority of the carbon source is not used for the generation of energy nor biomass. In phase 2, in which mitochondrial LDH was considered, TCA fluxes could be maintained as in phase 1 at the maximal rate encountered; hence, the energy available for cells to grow was similar in both phases, obtaining similar growth rate.",

In contrast, only phase 1 was observed in hybridoma cultures even when pH was non-controlled. FBA showed that TCA fluxes in phase 1 and phase 2 were similar, obtaining similar cell growth rate, but glucose uptake rate was much lower in phase 2 due to the lactate co-consumption. Some authors hypothesize that cells metabolize extracellular lactate as a strategy for pH detoxification [2] . Glucose and lactate co-metabolization resulted in a better-balanced cell metabolism, as can be seen from the metabolic fluxes calculated, with minor effects on cell growth. The observation of glucose and lactate co-consumption metabolic behavior and its deeper study and characterization could open the door of novel culturing strategies with the aim of increasing bioprocesses productivity. Background Transient protein expression in mammalian cell lines has gained increasing relevance as it enables fast and flexible production of high-quality eukaryotic protein. Considerable efforts have thus been made to overcome existing limiting aspects of transient gene expression systems, in terms of cell lines, cell culture-based systems, and protein production in a cost-effective manner. Milligram amounts of protein per liter can be produced within several days, allowing a significant shortening of the bioproduction process in comparison to protein production from stable clones. To ensure the robustness of the process, it is essential to have a reliable and easy-to-use transfection method. To palliate for the need of a reliable transfection reagent, we developed PEIpro\u00ae, the only commercially available PEI optimised for mid to large-scale transient protein production during process development. PEIpro\u00ae is a non-polydiperse and fully-characterised polymer that has become the gold PEI standard due to its reliability, reproducibility in high DNA delivery efficiency and in ensuing high protein production yields. Here, we present experimental data showing the benefits of using PEIpro\u00ae for protein production in comparison to other PEIs. We further demonstrate compatibility of using PEIpro\u00ae for recombinant protein production in most commonly used chemicallydefined media. Materiel and methods Suspension HEK-293 and CHO cells were cultured in shaker flasks in various synthetic media, as listed in Table 1 . HEK-293 and CHO cells were resuspended at 1\u00d710 6 cells/ml of serum-free medium, on the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5-1 mg of plasmid DNA encoding for the Luciferase gene reporter using PEIpro\u00ae, PEI \"Max\" and L-PEI 25 kDa (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) resuspended at 1 mg/ml according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

The tricistronic strategy resulted in the most efficient, showing a 3.5fold increase in terms of productivity with respect to the bicistronic double-transfection for Tzmb in CHO-S cells and a 5-fold increase in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a) . In the case of Tzmb-IFN\u03b12b, the tricistronic strategy also allowed to achieve higher productivities than the bicistronic one (Fig. 1b) . Regarding the differences of specific productivity between both cell lines tested, HEK293 emerged as the best production host candidate, for the two tested strategies (tricistronic and bicistronic) and for the two produced proteins, showing a 1.5-fold increase in terms of productivity with respect to CHO-S cells for Tzmb using the tricistronic strategy. Tzmb and Tzmb-IFN\u03b12b were analysed in terms of their antigen binding capacity, and both were find to efficiently bind to HER2+ Skbr-3 cells (Fig. 1c) . Thus, the antibody affinity to HER2 antigen has not been affected when fused to INF-\u03b12b. Finally, antiproliferative activity of Tzmb and Tzmb-IFN\u03b12b were assessed on the same Sk-br-3 cells. At a concentration of 500 nM of Tzmb, and after a 72-hour incubation, Sk-br-3 cells presented a 83% growth with respect to the untreated control. However, no antiproliferative effect was observed for Tzmb-IFN\u03b12b (Fig. 1d) .",

The genetic engineering of patient-specific T cells with lentiviral vectors (LVV) expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for late phase clinical trials requires the large-scale manufacture of high-titer vector stocks. The state-of-the-art production of LVV is based on 10-to 40layer cell factories transiently transfected in the presence of serum. This manufacturing process is extremely limited by its labor intensity, open-system handling operations, its requirements for significant incubator space plus costs and patience risk due to presence of serum.

Furthermore, it provides an insight how therapeutic genes and the expression of its transgene can influence cell productivity. led to a vast increase in productivity, CHO cells yield less than other expression systems like yeast or bacteria [1] . To improve yields and find beneficial bioprocess phenotypes, genetic engineering plays an essential role in recent research. The miR-23 cluster with its genomic paralogues (miR-23a and miR-23b) was first identified as differentially expressed during temperature shift, suggesting its role in proliferation and productivity [2] . The common approach to deplete miRNAs is the use of a sponge decoy which, requires the introduction of reporter genes. As an alternative this work aims to knockdown miRNA expression using the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 system which does not require a reporter transcript. This system consists of two main components: the single guide RNA (sgRNA) and an endonuclease (Cas9) which induces double strand breaks (DSBs). These DSBs can result in insertion or deletion (indels) of base pairs which can disrupt miRNA function and processing [3] .",

Our work deals with humanization of murine mAb2/ 3H6. The superhumanization approach leads to a loss of binding affinity which was partially restored by a single human-to-mouse backmutation (T98hR). [1] This residue was selected by synergistic combination of sequence analyses of antibody framework regions and structural information using novel in silico simulations. For structural stabilization, a conglomeration of tyrosine residues surrounding T98hR was identified, the so called \"tyrosine cage\". [2] Analysis of the \"tyrosine cage\" was done by alanine scanning mutations with a double mutation variant T98hR + Y27hA (BM09) and a triple mutation variant T98hR + Y27hA + Y32hA (BM10). In a recent series of experiments we tried to enhance binding affinity by three new variants with backmutations in the variable light chain (VL). Originating from T98hR, residues in the VL were selected based on their spatial proximity to the CDR3 loop of the variable heavy chain. Affinity improvement of T98hR was evaluated by VL-double backmutation variants T98hR + F46lL (SU01) and T98hR + Q49lS (SU02) and a triple backmutation variant T98hR + F46lL + Q49lS (SU03).",

Further affinity improvement of the single mutation variant T98hR could have been reached via mutations in the VL. It demonstrates the underestimated role of the VL for the interaction with its binding partner. Although CHO cells are a major expression system for production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals, the molecular and cellular background characterizing a high producer is largely unknown. It has been observed that in producer cell lines important signaling pathways like the Akt-signaling are altered in characteristical ways. Thus analyzing according signaling events should lead to identification of key elements characterizing high producer cells. To investigate this, our emphasis lies on the phosphorylation status of involved proteins as reversible switches in all signaling pathways. We aimed to establish a workflow for CHO-specific phosphoproteomics and focused on IGF signaling, as cell culture media often are supplemented with this growth factor. Two producer cell lines and the according parental cells were cultivated in a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiment, followed by quantitative MS phosphoproteomic analysis including CHOspecific data evaluation.",

In sum, our sucessfully established phosphoproteomic approach allows to detect important signaling key players in CHO cells that subsequently can be targeted through cell engineering or small molecule treatment. To improve antibody production in the CHO cell expression system, it seems to be useful to up-or downregulate gene expression including antibody folding, secretion, and cell metabolism. Many cell engineering approaches, including gene introduction, knockout and knockdown, have been employed to enhance recombinant antibody production [1] . However, identifying production enhancer genes is the rate-limiting step for CHO cell engineering, because the conventional method requires a series of experiments including genomic integration of the tested genes, selection of stable cell clones and cell culture experiments of several clones. In this study, we propose an approach for rapid evaluation of production enhancer genes based on an episomal expression system.",

Therefore, IgG1-EB01 cell lines were selected for further study. After the transfection, the number of GFP-positive cells continued to increase even after the passage (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the pOTC-GFP plasmid was stably retained and replicated by EBNA1/oriP system in IgG1-EB01 cell lines. In preliminary experiments, we introduced three genes, MDH2, GSS and GCLM, into IgG1-EB01 cell lines.

The levels of \u03b2-actin and the products of most other genes that were detected by mRNA-seq differed by approximately 20% in the comparison between SC39 and SC20 (SC39 > SC20). Based on the analysis of gene expression levels per cell volume, approximately 90% of detected genes showed lower expression in both DG44-SC39 and IgG3-SC39 compared with the levels in DG44-SC20 and IgG3-SC20, respectively. In addition, the number of genes whose expression level was decreased in IgG3-SC39 compared with that in DG44-SC39 was larger than those showing the opposite pattern. The results of the comparisons between IgG3-SC20 and IgG3-SC39 indicate that differentially expressed genes were mainly related to cell growth (e.g. Myc, SMAD), apoptosis (e.g. Caspase), lipid metabolism (e.g. SREBP, PPAR\u03b3) and epigenetic histone modification (e.g. BRCA, HAT) pathways. The mRNA levels of Myc, SMAD, Caspase, BRCA and HAT related genes were lower in IgG3-SC39, while those of SREBP and PPAR\u03b3 related genes were higher in IgG3-SC39.

A reduction per unit volume in the expression of genes that are required for survival might generate additional energy for recombinant protein production in high-chromosome-number cells. From an evolutionary perspective, an increased set of chromosomes underlies rapid evolutionary adaptation. Although there are issues to be considered, such as stability, there may also be advantages to using high-chromosome-number aneuploid CHO cells as a production host cells of recombinant proteins. Background Human growth factors have an enormous therapeutic potential. Among them, the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can induce de novo bone formation endowing the protein a high therapeutic potential. However, finding a suitable recombinant production system for such a protein still remains a challenge.",

The maximum rhBMP2 concentration detected in the culture supernatant was low for stable clones but can be greatly improved combining the HEK-293 cells transient expression system and batch reactor cultivation which reflects a better compatibility of the codon usage in the human cells (Table 1) . hBMP2 protein is sensitive to slightly acidic pH and to a lesser extend to proteases (Fig. 1a ) and binds to both producers cell lines (Fig. 1b) -All this could incidentally contribute to the low product titers. Cell-free protein synthesis has been proposed as alternative for \"difficult-to-express\" proteins. Since native hBMP2 is glycosylated, a cell-free system based on eukaryotic cell lysates is required for its production. CHO cell lysates were chosen, since they had previously been established as the most productive eukaryotic system in our hands [1] , while concomitantly enabling a direct comparison to the production of hBMP2 in stable clones established in CHO-K1. The ability to perform post-translational modifications is a major advantage of eukaryotic systems. The CHO lysates prepared by the protocol used here have previously been shown to contain significant amounts of endogenous microsomes derived from the endoplasmatic reticulum during lysis [2] . To enforce translocation of the target protein into the microsomal structures, a melittin signal peptide was fused to the hBMP2 cDNA. The glycosylation of the protein was assessed by enzymatic treatment (PNGase, EndoH) and confirmed using 14 C-mannose for the de novo protein synthesis. Upon cell-free protein synthesis, the hBMP2 yield was 100-fold higher than the best one in the HEK-293 cells. The difference becomes even more dramatic, when productivities are considered (Table 1) , i.e. the fact that maximum product titers are reached within 3 h in the cellfree system compared to 120 h in the cell-based ones. This demonstrates that the cell-free expression system is most suitable compared to mammalian cell expression method for the production of glycosylated human BMP2 (Table 1 ) [3] .",

XBP1s is a transcription factor involved in activation of chaperones (like Grp78, Calreticulin) and apoptotic genes (such as CHOP). Significant increase in the levels of calreticulin was seen on treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 1g) . Both XBP1s and Grp78 were marginally induced when treated with 30ng/mL of tunicamycin in both CTE-and STE-cultures (Fig. 1h) , and significantly up-regulated when treated with 500ng/mL of tunicamycin. The CHOP mRNA levels also increase with increasing tunicamycin concentrations, with levels in STE-cultures lower than CTE-cultures (Fig. 1h) . The results suggest that UPR induction may be important to increase productivity in these CTE/STE-cultures. Note that, tunicamycin had no effect on the expression levels of IgG heavy-chain, thus eliminating the involvement of IgGHC-mRNA in increasing productivity (Fig. 1i) .",

At lower concentrations of tunicamycin, a fine balance between optimum UPR induction and apoptosis can be achieved, as seen in 30ng/mL tunicamycin STE-cultures. In summary, this study demonstrates an alternate approach to enhance productivity of current industrial cell lines. Background Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been widely used for the large-scale production of biopharmaceuticals [1] . To construct antibody-producing CHO cells, exogenous genes encoding antibodies are usually integrated into unspecified regions of chromosomes (random integration). However, the chromatin structure differs depending on the location of the chromosomal region, which affects the expression level of the gene of interest [2] . Recently, gene-targeting methods that enable site-specific integration of expression vectors have been developed. However, the regions that are most efficient for exogenous gene expression have not been clarified. We previously constructed a CHO genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library generated from the recombinant CHO-DG44 cell line. It was expected to cover the entire CHO genome five times. The 20 chromosomes in CHO-DG44 cells were aligned in decreasing order of size and assigned letters from A to T [3] . Three hundred and four BAC clones were mapped to every chromosome of CHO-DG44. Among the karyotypes of CHO-DG44, CHO-K1 and primary Chinese hamster cells, chromosomes A and B are considered as the sole paired chromosomes corresponding to chromosome 1 in primary Chinese hamster cells. Hence, chromosomes A and B are considered to be stable [4] . In this study, we constructed antibody-producing cells by using a gene-targeting method, which focused on the stable chromosomes.",

Background Breast cancer is the second main cause of cancer related deaths for women worldwide and among them the triple negative subtype (TNBC) represents a clinical challenge by being associated with high mortality and having no effective therapies against it [1] , [2] . Accordingly, there is an urgent need to design new and more effective drugs to treat breast cancer. Notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved cell-to-cell communication pathway crucial during embryonic and breast development and tissue homeostasis. This pathway is often hyper-activated by overexpression of Notch receptors and/or its ligands in several types of cancers, such as breast cancer (TNBC included), where it contributes to its development, progression and drug resistance [3] , [4] , [5] . Our aim is to generate a function blocking antibody against the Notch Delta-like-1 (DLL1) ligand with therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer. Materials and methods DNA of human DLL1 full length extracellular domain (DLL1-ECD) and a truncated version, containing the minimal binding region to the Notch receptor (DLL1-EGF3), were cloned into pFUSE-Fc1-IgG1, and expressed in HEK293E6cells. Recombinant proteins were purified from culture media by Protein-A affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The human scFv phage display Tomlinson I+J library was used to select specific scFv against peptides targeting DLL1 binding regions to Notch. The binding ability and specificity of the selected scFv clones was evaluated by scFv-on-Phage ELISA.",

Recombinant DLL1 and peptides were used to select for monoclonal antibodies by Phage Display. After three rounds of panning with DLL1 peptides we identified 13 scFv positive clones, 2 of which presented high affinity to DLL1-ECD-FC. Currently we are performing more phage display selections to increase the number of positive clones. scFv with higher affinities will be reformatted into IgGs and their ability to inhibit the Notch pathway will be evaluated.

Clinical use of gene therapies to treat formerly incurable genetic diseases is advancing rapidly. Viral vectors are an important tool for introducing genes into target cells. Many gene therapies have been developed using adherent cells in 2-dimensional flatware or roller bottles but using these technologies to reach commercial-scale production represents a significant challenge. The iCELLis bioreactor enables large-scale viral vector production by providing a 3-dimensional matrix for cell growth in a compact configuration (Fig. 1 ). Up to 500 m 2 of surface area is available in a compact bioreactor measuring 88 mm in diameter in a total volume of 75 L with pH, DO and temperature control. A key feature of the iCELLis bioreactor is that it scales by increasing the diameter of the fixed-bed while keeping the height constant with no change in aspect ratios. The height of the fixed-bed can be varied (2, 4 and 10 cm) as well as density of carrier packing (96 gm/L or 144 gm/L). The iCELLis system comes in two formats, the iCELLis Nano bioreactor (0.53-4.0 m 2 ) and the iCELLis 500 bioreactor (66-500 m 2 ). Processes developed in the bench top iCELLis Nano bioreactor can be directly transferred to the corresponding iCELLis 500 system. The iCELLis Nano bioreactor enables an efficient platform for process optimization. ",

Academic research is gaining information about intracellular targets or functional mechanisms through the variety of different assays. These benefits can be used in preclinical studies and furthermore costly late-stage drug failures may be reduced by the use of cell-based assays. The use of automated systems is also in great demand and will change the testing of substances and research activities. Nevertheless, there are a lot of barriers at the moment limiting the successful application of automated systems in this field. By the lack of flexibility and the demand for skilled computer scientists & engineers just the two main aspects stated by experts shall be mentioned. Our strong background on automated cell culture technologies and expertise, gained in several projects, let us rethink the overall process chain and overcome established principles. A new service orientated platform for the execution of cell-based assays that are commonly used will be introduced. The main idea is to give access to automated infrastructure for academic research or spin-offs which cannot afford the special infrastructure. ",

            "text": "Taken together, these results demonstrated that the functional immortalization technology provides physiologically relevant cells in sufficient numbers and that the magnetic 3D Bioprinting technology enabled a fast, consistent cell aggregation and the formation of stable uniform spheroids. Importantly, these immortalized cells are capable to differentiate when a suitable stimulus is provided. For differentiation into mini bones, 3D spheroid cultivation and additional stimulation by small molecules are required. The combination of physiologically relevant cell systems with three dimensional culturing will help to generate in vitro test systems which closely resemble the in vivo physiology and thereby supporting future drug discovery approaches. Fig. 1 (abstract P-381) . Characterization of spheroid \"mini bones\". a Different number (1.000-50.000 cells) of CI-huOB cells were printed into spheroids. b 20.000 CI-huOBs were printed into spheroids and cultivated for indicated time points. c For analyzing spheroid sizes, pictures were taken and quantified by ImageJ. (D/E) 20.000 CI-huOB cells were printed into spheroids and cultivated with (huOB Differentiation Medium) or without a differentiation stimulus for two weeks. Afterwards, bioprinted spheroids were sectioned by a cryo microtome and d stained for Ca 2+ deposits (Alizarin Red S) or e stained for alkaline phosphatase activity",

Glycan analysis from modulating glycosylation with EfficientFeed C+ and GlycanTune C+ Background Surface active agents (surfactants) are commonly used cell culture medium components for reducing shear stress in nonstatic suspension culture. Despite the preferred application of poloxamer 188, there is an ongoing discussion within the cell culture community about surfactant-related process deviations. Furthermore, surfactants have been shown to interact with polyplexes as well as polymer nanoparticles within various applications (e.g. transfection, encapsulation). Better understanding the related mechanisms of action will facilitate finding alternative components for progressive cell culture media formulations.Materials and methodsHEK 293-F and CHO-K1 cell lines were cultivated in Xell's chemically defined transfection media (HEK TF or CHO TF) in plain and baffled shake flasks to evaluate the impact of surfactants on shear stress. The surfactants were also evaluated regarding their impact on transient GFP expression via flow cytometry.

One main topic of these technologies is the production of proteins used for therapeutical purposes. These in vivo production processes are often time consuming and limited in production of so called \"difficult-to-express\" proteins including the pharmaceutical relevant class of membrane proteins. To overcome these issues, novel cell-free protein synthesis platforms were developed based on the industrial working horse CHO cells [1] . Cell lysates provide a basis for this technology by including all components of the translational machinery and enabling protein production within a few hours. Microsomal structures present in CHO cell lysates enable posttranslational modification of target proteins and insertion of membrane proteins into lipid bilayer.",

Different classes of proteins were selected to evaluate the quality of the CHO CECF system including a transmembrane receptor, a single chain variable fragment and an ion channel. Cell-free protein synthesis was performed in the presence of 14 C leucine for radio labeling of synthesized proteins. Protein yield was quantified by TCA precipitation of radio labeled proteins followed by scintillation measurement and molecular mass was detected by autoradiography.

This approach opens up a fast and cost-effective process pipeline for the production of \"difficult-to-express\" proteins and shows a high potential for industrial applications including screening technologies, protein structure determination and just-in-time protein production processes.",
