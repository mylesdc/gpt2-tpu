To characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by genome-wide gene expression analysis of lung and brain tissues. The Hendra, Nipah-Bangladesh, and Nipah-Malaysia strains caused severe respiratory and neurological disease with animals succumbing around 7 days post infection. Despite the presence of abundant viral shedding, animal-toanimal transmission did not occur. The host gene expression profiles of the lung tissue showed early activation of interferon responses and subsequent expression of inflammation-related genes that coincided with the clinical deterioration. Additionally, the lung tissue showed unchanged levels of lymphocyte markers and progressive downregulation of cell cycle genes and extracellular matrix components.

To characterize the mechanisms of henipavirus disease in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by characterization of the host response in lung and brain Introduction Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses (genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae) are zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe acute respiratory distress and neurological disease in humans [1] . HeV was initially identified during an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in horses in Australia in 1994. To date, 7 human cases of HeV infection have been identified, all associated with direct contact with infected horses and with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 57% [2] . NiV was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory and neurological disease in pigs in 1998-99 that led to infections in humans in Malaysia (283 cases) and Singapore (11 cases) with a CFR of 38% [3] . Subsequent outbreaks of NiV have occurred almost yearly in humans in Bangladesh and India with increased CFR (75%) and higher prevalence of respiratory disease (from 40% to 75%) [2, 4] . In addition, human-to-human transmission has only been observed during outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh. The NiV strains isolated during outbreaks in Malaysia and Bangladesh are genetically distinct and have been designated as the Malaysia strain (NiV-M) and Bangladesh strain (NiV-B), respectively [5, 6] . In hamsters and other animal models, infection with HeV is generally more severe than infection with NiV-M and NiV-B [7, 8] . These possible differences in virulence between HeV and NiV-M have also been observed in the recently developed African green monkey model [9] . Interestingly, in that same model, a recent study showed that NiV-B is more pathogenic, similar to what is seen during outbreaks of human disease [10] . The differences in the pathogenic mechanisms of these strains, which ultimately drive the disparity of clinical outcomes and transmission profiles, remain largely unknown.",

Clinical signs were first noticeable on day 5 post infection (pi), and included development of fever, labored breathing, mild paralysis, generalized tremors and subcutaneous edema of the head and neck, followed by rapidly progressing clinical signs on days 6 and 7 pi. This coincided with a small increase in body temperature of HeV and NiV-B infected animals on day 5 pi (S1 Fig). Moribund animals displayed clinical signs that included lack of grooming, hunched posture, ataxia, severe depression, labored breathing, occasional subcutaneous edema of the neck and head, vomiting; and neurological signs such as continuous licking, tremors, imbalance, myoclonus, head tilt, hind limb paralysis and seizures. The majority of animals succumbed of infection by day 6-8 pi with a lethal dose 50% (LD 50 ) for HeV, NiV-B and NiV-M of 5, 32 and 22 TCID 50 , respectively ( Fig  1A-1C) .

All the infected ferrets were euthanized due to severe disease on day 5 and 6 pi (dpi). In the infected animals, low levels of viral RNA were detected in nasal washes for all viruses by 3 dpi (S3A Fig). Interestingly, on 5 dpi, shedding of NiV-M and HeV were significantly higher in nasal washes compared to NiV-B. Once animals were moribund, no significant differences in viral shedding in nasal washes were observed between the 3 virus strains. Shedding of HeV in oral swabs was significantly higher compared to NiV-B on 5 dpi and NiV-M when the animals were moribund (S3B Fig) . The na\u00efve ferrets that were co-housed with the infected animals showed no evidence of weight-loss or clinical signs, and they were euthanized three weeks post initial exposure. Their nasal, oral, and rectal swabs remained negative for virus throughout the study, and no virus specific antibodies were detected by ELISA or neutralization assay (S1 Table) , suggesting that asymptomatic infection did not occur following direct contact with infected animals.

Moreover, gene members of the TGF-beta, Wnt/beta-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways, which are directly involved in the regulation of growth and cell cycle, were also downregulated. This scenario is further confirmed by enrichment of genes that belong to the protein-protein interaction hubs of transcription factors such as CTNNB1, SMAD3 and SMAD4 (Fig 4C) , which are central components of the TGF-beta and Wnt/bcatenin signaling pathways.

Functional enrichment of regulated genes in during HeV and NiV-B shows the progressive activation of genes belonging to the Innate Immune Response and Immune System Process categories that occurs in parallel with the global gene activation ( Fig  5B and 5C ). Interestingly, we observed enrichment of downregulated genes that belong to the extracellular matrix category (Fig 5C) , which can be related to homeostatic alterations in the brain tissue. In terms of cellular immune responses, expression of selected macrophage markers increased progressively during infection with both viruses (Fig 5D) , and also, a number of lymphocyte markers were found to be upregulated in HeV at 5 dpi, whereas a more restricted activation of this group of genes was observed in NiV-B infection (Fig 5E) .

            "text": "HeV and NiV are emerging zoonotic viruses that can cause severe acute respiratory distress and acute encephalitis in humans. Outbreaks of infection with genetically distinct henipavirus strains in Malaysia (NiV-M), Bangladesh (NiV-B) and Australia (HeV) are associated with differences in clinical outcome and transmission patterns [2] . To better characterize their distinctive clinical features and understand their pathogenic mechanisms of disease, we performed experimental infections in a model of young ferrets, followed by analysis of their gene expression profiles in the lung and brain tissues. In these experiments, the three strains produced uniformly lethal infection and similar clinical signs that included severe respiratory and neurological disease. We also observed that the lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen were important targets of infection, suggesting that multiorgan failure was a likely cause of death, similar to that observed in the human cases that developed severe respiratory disease [19] and in other animal models of henipavirus infection [8, 9, 13, 20, 21] . Interestingly, despite the severe disease and viral shedding, no evidence of animal-to-animal transmission was observed. This is in agreement with previous studies showing a lack of transmission in the presence of viral shedding [22] . Based on the LD 50 for each of the three viruses, HeV was most virulent, followed by NiV-M and where NiV-B required the highest dose to achieve 50% mortality, a scenario that is in accordance with the findings from previous reports [7] [8] [9] . The LD 50 of NiV-M was lower compared to previous reports [15] . The use of younger animals in the current study may have had an effect on the susceptibility to these viruses resulting in a lower LD50 (for NiV-M) then previously reported. In addition, the immune system is still developing in young animals and as such may respond differently to outside stimuli. For instance, young ferrets are less susceptible to severe disease following influenza or SARS-CoV challenge compared to adults [23, 24] . This difference is believed to result from differences in host responses. However, in the current study, clinical signs, histopathological changes and other parameters are very similar to what has been reported in adult animals. Therefore, while this can only be confirmed by side-byside comparison studies of young and adult animals, we believe that many of the results reported here, will be applicable regardless of age. Another variable that may affect the challenge efficacy is the volume used for the intranasal inoculation. The volume may affect the consistency to establish infection in a host, however the volumes used in other studies have not been reported. In order to increase the consistency of infection, we and others have used the same challenge dose of 5,000 TCID 50 , which results in a very robust challenge model [15, 25] . While the relative challenge dose may differ for each of the 3 henipavirus strains, given that they have different LD 50 , no correlation has been observed between dose, clinical outcome, histopathological changes and virus replication [15, 25] .",

After performing IN inoculation, HeV and NiV infect the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, the trachea, bronchi and alveoli [8, 28] . Then, henipavirus infected epithelial cells produce type I interferon responses [29] that activate the antiviral responses, and cytokines that activate different components of the humoral and cellular innate immune responses at the tissue level [8, 28, [30] [31] [32] . As the respiratory infection progresses, the intensity of the local responses escalate beyond a biological threshold and triggers the activation of the endothelial cells, which, in turn, orchestrate and amplify the cytokine and chemokine responses leading to systemic immune activation, as shown for influenza virus [33] .",

Henipavirus infection results in increasing expression and broadening repertoires of mediators of inflammation, including cytokines, chemokines, CAMs, and also, increased expression levels of macrophage markers (CD14, CD40, CD80, CD86, CD274 and LY96) due to the influx of these cells into the infected lung tissue (Fig 3E) . The development of tissue damage also coincided with the onset of clinical signs (Fig 2B-2D) , and is possibly driven by the strong activation of NF-kb mediated responses that lead to high levels of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lung, a scenario that is commonly found in respiratory infections of viral origin [8, 9, 21, 32, 36] . One caveat in this study is that tissues used for host gene expression analysis were not perfused to remove blood which could potentially \"contaminate\" host gene expression profiles.

Strikingly, we found that the infection with HeV and NiV-B did not modify the expression levels of lymphocyte markers (CD2, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD4, CD8A and CD27) in the lung tissue by 5 dpi (Fig 3F) .

The capacity of henipaviruses to spread to lymphoid tissues, including the infection of lymph nodes [42] and the infection of the spleen that was found in the present study ( Fig 2J) and also by others [43] , has been previously linked to a subsequent loss of immune responsiveness [43] . Nonetheless, it has not yet been established whether this capacity of henipaviruses to infect lymphoid organs is the result of non-specific systemic spread, or mediated by selective targeting of immune cells; if confirmed, the latter scenario would bear resemblance to that observed in measles infection, where the capacity of the virus to target immune cells [44] contributes to the hallmark immunosuppressive capability of measles virus [45, 46] .",

This is similar to observation with different SARS-CoV strains [24, 53] . Infection with henipaviruses, is associated with a strong host innate immune response, which contributes to severe respiratory stress and lethality. Fig 6  recapitulates the major findings in terms of viral spread across body compartments and host responses in the lung and brain tissues during henipavirus infection in ferrets. Although the molecular mechanisms governing henipavirus pathogenesis remain unknown, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which henipavirus infection induces changes in the host response in lung and brain, leading to death.",

B) In the lung tissue, the virus presents high growth rates and only after the inflammatory responses become fully active, at around day 4, the levels of virus stabilize but without significantly decreasing. Signaling and effector molecules of the innate immunity become expressed, innate immune cells migrate to the lung tissue, but, interestingly, gene expression data strongly suggest that lymphocytes are not migrating and expanding in the affected tissues. Additionally, the expression of genes related to the cell cycle, growth factors and growth factor signaling decline through the infectious process, possibly related to the degradation of the physiological functions of the lung tissue. C) In the brain tissue, the virus grows at a slower rate as compared to the lung tissue. The brain mounts a restricted immune response in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this tissue that includes infiltration and/or local expansion of macrophages, and possibly of lymphocytes, but without leading to a noticeable alteration of the viral growth kinetics. HeV was isolated from a horse during an outbreak in Brisbane in 1994, NiV-M was isolated from a patient with neurological disease during the 1998 outbreak in Malaysia, and NiV-B was isolated from a patient with severe respiratory distress during the 2004 outbreak in Bangladesh. Low-passage virus stocks were used however the exact passage history was not known. The viruses were propagated on Vero cells (CCL-81; ATCC) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with L-Glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone; Logan UT) at 37\u02daC in humidified CO2 incubator (5%). All infectious work was performed in class II BSC in the biosafety level 4 laboratory (BSL4) at the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB.",

The resulting RNA samples were analyzed in an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) to ensure that each sample met the quality requirements for sequencing (RIN!7.5). The cDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA prep kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The resulting libraries were quantified by qPCR using the Kappa Illumina quantification kit (Kappa), pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2500 (50bp single end). To build the reference library, the ferret transcriptome MusPutFur V1 (NCBI accession number AEYP00000000.1) [16] was filtered so that genes with multiple splicing variants only retained the sequence of their first variant. Bowtie2 was used to align the short-read sequences with respect to the ferret transcriptome [55] , and later, the read counts were loaded in MultiExperiment viewer v4.9 [56] and DEGseq with the MA-plot with random sampling model [57] was used to compute the statistical significances.

Ferrets were infected with 5,000 TCID 50 of HeV and NiV-B and euthanized at 3 and 5 d.p.i. and together with an uninfected control group (n = 3 per group). Transcriptomic analysis of the lung tissue was performed by RNA-seq. A) Number of significantly up-and down-regulated genes with respect to the control group (fold-variation>\u00b11.5 and FDR<0.05) at 3 and 5 dpi. B) Functional gene classification of differentially expressed genes. For each time-point, up-and down-regulated genes were subjected to functional classification and a selected group of gene categories from 1 Gene Ontology and 2 KEGG Pathways that are related with the immune responses are shown. For each functional category, the number of up-and down-regulated genes and the level of significance of the enrichment (Fisher's exact test p-value) are indicated. C) Heatmap showing the level of activation of genes belonging to the Response to Type I Interferon category, which encompasses antiviral response genes, during the course of HeV and NiV-B infection. D) Functional enrichment of up-regulated genes that belong to protein-protein interaction (PPI) hubs of transcription factors. E-F) Evolution in the mRNA expression levels of selected macrophage markers and lymphocyte markers, respectively, during HeV and NiV-B infection. These sets of markers were selected from the literature according to their association with these two cell populations, and their coordinated upregulation reflects an increase of the associated cell population in the tissue.

(n = 3 per group, except for HeV_D5 with n = 2) and together with an uninfected control group (n = 2). Transcriptomic analysis of frontal lobe tissue was performed by RNA-seq. A) Number of significantly up-and down-regulated genes with respect to the control group (fold-variation>\u00b11.5 and FDR<0.05) at 3 and 5 d. p.i. B) Evolution of gene enrichment score (Fisher's exact test p-value) of the Innate Immune Response category (Gene Ontology) throughout the infection. C) Functional gene classification of differentially expressed genes in the brain tissue. Regulated genes were subjected to functional classification and a selected 1 Gene Ontology categories and 2 KEGG Pathways that are related to the immune responses and cell growth signaling are shown. For each functional category, the number of up-and down-regulated genes and the level of significance of the enrichment (Fisher's exact test p-value) are indicated. D-E) Evolution in the mRNA expression levels of selected macrophage markers and lymphocyte markers, respectively, during HeV and NiV-B infection in the brain tissue. Dark grey shaded areas indicate no variation with respect to the control group (<\u00b11.5 fold-change). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006343.g005 Host responses during lethal henipavirus infection in ferrets PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006343 March 14, 2018",

A comparative study using a dose of 5,000 TCID 50 for each of the three viruses was performed in ferrets: viral shedding in the ferret secretions was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in nasal washes (A), oral swabs (B), rectal swabs (C) and urine (D). Samples were harvested from 6-week old ferrets infected with NiV-B (grey), NiV-M (black solid) and HeV (black dashed) on various days post infection as described in Materials and Methods. Samples from 5 animals per group were analyzed at each time point. \u00c3 p<0.01, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Error bars represent standard deviations.
