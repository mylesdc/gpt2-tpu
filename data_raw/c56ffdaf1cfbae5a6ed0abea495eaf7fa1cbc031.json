Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness. All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies. Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection. Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed. Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation. Half of the group I animals were infected with a recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV derived from the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. This infectious clone produced disease indistinguishable from wild-type Urbani strain.",

The global SARS outbreak ended that July, but during its existence the disease caused 774 fatalities and had a significant economic impact on Southeast Asia [3] [4] [5] . A special concern was its predilection for nosocomial spread, as 21% of SARS cases occurred in healthcare workers . In certain local outbreaks, hospital staff accounted for over 50% of cases, and nosocomial spread to other patients or family members accounted for a significant proportion of SARS cases [6] .",

BALB/c mice were shown to support high levels of viral replication in the respiratory tract after intranasal challenge, and this model has been used to test SARS vaccines [8] [9] [10] . Infection of an additional rodent model (the strain 129SvEv mouse) showed infection of the respiratory epithelium after intranasal SARS-CoV challenge [11] . Domestic cats and ferrets support viral replication after intratracheal challenge, and ferret models have been used to study active and passive immunization against SARS [12] [13] [14] . Research has focused on several animal species as potential natural reservoirs for SARS-CoV. Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) were found to be susceptible to infection with a virus closely related to human SARS-CoV [15] . Experimental infection of civets produced clinical illness and histopathological evidence of pneumonia [16] . Chickens and pigs challenged with SARS-CoV had viral RNA in blood during the first week postinfection, but neither species appeared to support significant viral replication or manifested clinical illness [17] . Recently, Li et al. [18] reported that several species of wild bats in China are carriers of a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. No studies have evaluated animal model infection or pathogenesis of recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV) derived from a molecular clone [19] .",

Fever was notably absent in all studies, except for one African green monkey on day 3 postinfection [20] . All studies detected SARS-CoV replication in one or several monkey species and documented seroconversion, thereby confirming established infection. Aside from observable clinical symptoms, these studies relied on virus shedding and histopathology specimens from necropsy as objective markers of disease. Most studies euthanized animals during the course of infection to document histopathological disease. Only two studies followed animals for more than 14 d after infection [20, 22] . No study has examined radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease, which is one of the most prominent features of SARS in humans.",

Of the two animals infected with wild-type virus by a mucosal route, only one developed radiographic disease, and radiographic findings were relatively subtle. We cannot exclude the possibility that icSARS-CoV produces more significant pulmonary disease, but the difference in findings is more likely related to route of infection and dose. Animals that received icSARS-CoV (both in group I) were infected in the bronchus with a higher dose of virus. Importantly, the fact that recombinant icSARS-CoV produced disease clinically similar to its Urbani parent supports the hypothesis that the molecular clone recapitulates the disease phenotype in the macaque. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV is the sole cause of SARS, without the involvement of coinfecting or passenger agents.

            "text": "Evidence of persistent viral replication in the upper airways has varied between studies. Rowe et al. [25] reported a sparse number of positive nasal and oral swabs, although one of each was positive at PID 12. In contrast, combined data from Kuiken et al. [23] and Fouchier et al. [21] show nasal or pharyngeal shedding in five of six animals. McAuliffe et al. [20] detected respiratory tract shedding for 2-10 d after infection. We found that mucosally infected animals had universal shedding from the nasopharynx between PID 2 and 8 and had frequent shedding out to PID 23. We found significant and persisting virus presence in the urine and feces as well. Other studies have not reported testing urine for virus presence, although Kuiken et al. [23] report virus detection by PCR at necropsy in the kidney or urinary bladder of one animal each. McAuliffe et al. [20] found positive fecal samples by RT-PCR only in African green monkeys. Kuiken et al. [23] and Rowe et al. [25] tested rectal swabs for presence of virus but found none positive. Observed differences in model performance are difficult to explain but may be attributable to viral strain, dose or route of infection. Bukreyev et al. [22] and McAuliffe et al. [20] also used the Urbani strain of SARS CoV given by a similar route (intranasal and intratracheal), but our clinical observations were significantly different. We used a different assay method, but our total dose per animal was probably higher, as they used 10 6 to 10 6.3 cell culture infective doses (also referred to as TCID 50 ). Fouchier et al. [21] and Kuiken et al. [23] used a different strain of virus isolated from patient 5688. They observed the most prominent clinical symptoms despite using a similar dose (1 3 10 6 cell culture infective doses) administered in the nares and trachea. Rowe et al. [25] used a dose similar to ours (10 7 pfu) of SARS-CoV isolated from a Canadian patient. Their route of delivery was also through the nares and trachea.",

We observed unifocal or multifocal radiographic disease resolving quickly instead of progressing to severe diffuse disease, which is consistent with findings in children with SARS [37, 39, 42, 43] . Absence of fever may not be as significant as it would seem. In published reports, children with SARS did present with fever, but the data are biased, because fever was universally included in case definitions [36] [37] [38] [39] 41] . Fever in children less than ten years old who are diagnosed with SARS tends to be relatively mild and short in duration [36] [37] [38] [39] 41] . In these reports, it is possible that children with mild clinical illness from SARS who did not develop a significant fever may have remained undiagnosed. This premise is supported by at least one documented case of SARS in an adult without fever [49] . Hematologic findings, particularly lymphopenia, are more prevalent in children with SARS [36] [37] [38] [39] 41] than in the macaques of our study, but Rowe et al.

Adults and children appear to have similar levels of SARS-CoV viremia associated with infection, implying that levels of viral replication are similar in both groups [50] . Adults with SARS have significantly increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [51] [52] [53] . Activation of inflammatory cytokines in children with SARS may be less dramatic [54] , and preliminary data suggest that this is the case in NHPs as well [25] . Thus, immune response may account for variations in SARS severity between age groups and even species.",

As in prior studies, we found overt clinical disease in animals infected by mucosal routes that was much less severe than adult human SARS. We found radiographic pulmonary disease in most of these animals that resembled radiographic findings in human SARS. Overall, the disease we observed had some similarities to SARS in young children. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of NHP models to the study of SARS. ",

            "text": "Background. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia 2003 in many ways served as reminder of how a new infectious disease had the potential to cause huge economic disruption, as well as being of substantial public health importance. Although the cause of the disease was discovered quite quickly-a new virus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (corona being a description of the virus's spiky, crown-like appearance when seen under an electron microscope)-experts differed in their opinion on how the disease should be treated, and no vaccine has yet been developed for it.Why Was This Study Done? Previously identified human coronaviruses caused only mild respiratory infections. Hence researchers wanted to understand exactly how this new virus caused disease. Infecting animals with the virus was a crucial part of this research. Researchers had already given the virus to a number of animal species, ranging from mice to pigs to monkeys, but none had shown symptoms that were similar to those seen in humans.What Did the Researchers Do and Find? They infected a small number of macaques with the SARS-CoV, either into the nose and throat, nose and eye, or intravenously. Some of the animals were given the virus isolated from humans infected with disease, and others were given a genetically engineered virus that was identical in sequence to this virus. The virus was able to multiply in all the macaques, and all developed antibodies to the virus-evidence of an immune response. Chest radiographs from several animals infected via the nose, throat, or eye showed pneumonia that was at its worse between days 8 and 10 after infection. Overall, giving the virus intravenously rather than by these other routes produced a less severe infection. Also, there were no differences in signs or symptoms in animals given the natural virus rather than the engineered one.What Do These Findings Mean? Although necessarily the number of animals infected was very small, the researchers were able to get some interesting results. The infected animals did not get severe disease, but rather the disease was more like that seen in infected children. Nonetheless, this animal model of disease may well be useful in developing therapies and vaccines against this illness. In addition, they showed that the engineered virus produce the same symptoms as the one isolated from humans, which suggests that no other viruses are involved in causing SARS Where Can I Get More Information Online?
