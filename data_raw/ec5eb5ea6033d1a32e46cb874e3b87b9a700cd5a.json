            "text": "We compiled 1441 hemagglutinin sequences with known date and location of sampling previously obtained by [1] . These sequences were sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 and are representative of a larger sampling (13,000 isolates) used for antigenic analysis [1] . We explored different spatial and air travel-assisted subdivisions with sub-sampling to examine the impact of discrete sampling allocation and sample numbers per locations on our phylogeographic estimates. We note that sample sizes may strongly impact ancestral reconstruction using phylogenetic diffusion models. Depending on the location-specific diversity, over -and underrepresented locations may be more likely to be inferred as source/origin and sink/destination locations respectively. The bias arising from such over -and underrepresentation may be more pronounced when the overall sampling is sparse because the location specific-diversity may be poorly captured in such cases. Although it may be useful to have more samples available from locations in which a large viral diversity has been established, which may for example help to establish its potential role as a source location, and this would be the case for a random sample from the entire population of infections, it remains difficult to assess to what extent convenient sampling reflects the underlying epidemiology. In an attempt to include all sequence data while keeping the number of samples per location as balanced as possible, we divided all the sequences into 26 geographic regions (Table S1 in Text S1) ( Figure S1 in Text S1).",

For an ensemble of 1000 modularity subdivisions we quantify the uncertainty by an affinity matrix that, for each pair of locations, summarizes the fraction of partitions in which these locations are in the same community. Based on a partition encompassing a number of air communities (n = 14) that is in size close to the 15-geographic region partition, we subsequently obtain the average affinity for each airport to the communities in this partition. We assign each airport to the community for which it shows the highest average affinity, but we take into account its uncertainty by also considering assignments that yield affinities that are > 2/3 of the highest affinity score. This cut-off resulted in 771 ambiguous airport assignments. Finally, we partitioned the sequence data according to the air community assignment and accommodate 368 (24%) ambiguous sequence locations, i.e. those sequences related to airports with ambiguous community assignments, using ambiguity coding in our phylogeographic approach.",

We introduce a novel phylogenetic diffusion model and associated inference procedures in the subsections below. To model sequence evolution, we partition the hemagglutinin codon positions into first+second and third positions [4] and apply a separate HKY85 [5] CTMC model of nucleotide substitution with discrete gamma-distributed rate variation [6] to both. We assume a flexible Bayesian skyride prior over the unknown phylogeny [7] . Exploratory runs using the data for the 26 locations indicated that a relaxed molecular clock represented an over-parametrization [8] . A strict clock was therefore used in subsequent analyses. Because the exact date of sampling was not known for some additional publicly available sequences, we integrated out their dates over the known sampling time interval [9] . We capitalize on BEAGLE [10] in conjunction with BEAST to improve computational performance on our large data sets. MCMC analyses were run sufficiently long to ensure stationarity as diagnosed using Tracer. We used the TreeAnnotator tool in BEAST to summarize trees in the form of maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees. As part of the supporting information files (Dataset S1), we make available an XML document specifying the data and analysis settings for main analysis of the air communities, and the associated empirical trees required to run the analysis (section 1.3.3). This includes accession numbers for all the sequences as well as their sampling dates, the locations we assigned them to (section 1.1), the different sub-samplings, the (GLM) model settings and the predictors (section 1.3.1 and 1.3.2).",

In constructing our predictors, we shift the covariates to ensure positivity if needed (e.g. using a pseudo count for the passenger flux) and subsequently log-transform them. We note that other transformations, e.g. from the Box-Cox family, may also be explored in our framework. The incorporation of indicator variables allows for Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) [11, 12] , which involves estimating the posterior probabilities of all 2 P possible linear models that may or may not include the predictors. When an indicator \u03b4 p equals 1, then predictor x p is included in the model, demonstrating that it helps to explain the diffusion process in the phylogenetic history with high probability. We complete this GLM specification with variable selection by assigning independent Bernoulli prior probability distributions on \u03b4 p . We use a small prior probability on each predictor's inclusion that reflects a 50% prior probability on no predictors being included, but specifying equal prior probability on each predictor's inclusion and exclusion yields highly similar results (Fig. S3 ). Lemey et al. [13] discuss BSSVS in further detail and analogous to Edo-matas et al. [14] , we can use Bayes factors (BFs) [15, 16] to express how much the data change our prior opinion about the inclusion of each predictor. These BFs are calculated by dividing the posterior odds for the inclusion of a predictor with the corresponding prior odds, e.g. 0.019:0.981 prior odds for the analysis of the 14 air communities and 15 geographic regions (Fig. 2 in the main manuscript), or 1:1 odds for the same analyses using equal prior probability for each predictor's inclusion and exclusion ( Fig. S3) :",

We specify that a priori all \u03b2 p are independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and a relatively large variance of 4, which still ensures adequate mixing. We implement the GLM-diffusion parametrization in the software package BEAST [3] and approximate the joint posterior and its marginalizations using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) transition kernels. Similar to recent advances in phylogeographic inference in continuous space [17] , we integrate out discrete location states at internal nodes in the trees but draw stochastic realizations of the node states when logging the trees. An important, novel extension to the standard MCMC machinery in BEAST lies in generating an efficient Metropolis-Hastings proposal distribution for the GLM coefficients \u03b2. Given the potential for high correlation between predictors X, attempting to update one coefficient \u03b2 p at a time while holding the remaining coefficients constant returns high autocorrelations times. Instead, we exploit the fixed correlation structure X X between predictors to generate a multivariate proposal \u03b2 .",

Population size estimates for 2005, or interpolated for 2005 based on data close to this year, were obtained from Geographica [20] or www.citypopulation.de (listed in Table S1 , S2 and S3 in Text S1). In addition to general population sizes/densities, we also consider urban population sizes for the air communities/geographic regions based on airport-associated cities. For this purpose, we downloaded population sizes for all cities with a population exceeding 15000 (downloaded from the GeoNames geographical database: www.geonames.org) and associated them with the closest airport from the 1227-largest-airport network (that represents 95% of the passenger flux) within a 75 km radius. We subsequently aggregated all these airport associated population sizes for each air community or geographic area in which the airports are located and also included these as potential predictors in the model. This measure does not appear to be very sensitive to the radius threshold we use to associate cities with airports because a radius of 200 km results in numbers that highly correlate with the urban population sizes we used (r > 0.97). As an urban population density measure that accounts for the number of airports these population sizes are distributed over, we also considered a predictor that divides the airport-associated urban population sizes by the number of airports to which they were assigned in each air community/geographic region. Both the urban population sizes and densities are also listed in Table S1 , S2 and S3 in Text S1.

To side-step these limitations, we seek to approximate phylogenetic uncertainty in our phylogeographic estimates in cases where sampling from tree space needs to be performed repeatedly (e.g. when comparing different diffusion models). To this purpose, we follow [24] and implement a transition kernel that randomly draws from an empirical posterior distribution of trees which, in our case, were solely inferred from sequence data. Because the likelihood of a tree topology will largely be dominated by an informative sequence alignment compared to a single discrete (location) site, we expect such an empirical approach will closely approximate the phylogenetic uncertainty in the joint inference approach.

            "text": "As a validation, we test the GLM extension of the discrete diffusion model by simultaneously inferring the phylogeographic history of dog rabies viruses in Morocco and identifying the factors driving their dispersal based on a previously published data set [25] . The original study evaluated several potential predictors of dog rabies dispersal by fixing the parameters of the discrete rate matrix and independently fitting different models to the joint sequence and spatial data. Model-fit, as assessed using a harmonic mean estimator (HME) of the marginal likelihood, indicated that road distances were the best predictors of rabies diffusion in Morocco [25] . Considering the large variance and poor repeatability of the HME (see e.g. [26] ) and most importantly the fact that the HME systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood [27] , it remains difficult to unambiguously reject competing hypotheses (such as geographic distances, which were less than one ln likelihood unit different from the best fitting model). Here we compare our GLM-diffusion model with different marginal likelihood estimators including the HME and recent BEAST implementations of path sampling (PS), stepping stone sampling (SS) [28, 29, 30, 27, 31] , as well as the Akaike's information criterion through MCMC (AICM, [28, 32] ). Table S4 lists the marginal likelihood estimates for rates fixed to equal values, inverse distances, the product of origin and destination population sizes (human population sizes as a proxy for dog population sizes), the product of origin and destination population sizes divided by geographic distance (the so-called gravity model), inverse population surface distances, inverse road distances and accessibility estimates [25] . Two independent analyses were performed to assess the variability of the different estimators. The two runs for PS and SS consistently favored road distance over the other predictors while the HME and AICM preferred either road or geographic distance. Formal evaluation of these model comparison approaches has recently shown that both PS and SS are more reliable and more consistent than the HME and the AICM [28, 29, 30] . Nevertheless, substituting marginal likelihood estimates between the two runs for some predictors could yield a different PS or SS ranking of the models indicating that unambiguous model selection remains difficult. When applying the GLM-diffusion model, we do not consider equal rates because the model can default to this scenario when no predictors are included. We also do not explicitly construct a product of origin and population sizes nor a gravity model because the GLM approach can invoke these by simultaneously including the individual predictors (origin population size, destination population size and distance). The GLM-diffusion results in Table S 5 indicate that only road distances are supported (BF= 6.64) as a predictor with a mean conditional effect size of about \u22121.37 on a log scale and credible intervals that do not include zero. In conclusion, the GLM-diffusion model is consistent with state-of-the-art marginal likelihood estimators and direct support for predictors allows more robust model selection when comparing similar models.",
