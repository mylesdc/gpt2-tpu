We analyzed 219 camel and human MERS-CoV genome sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade A and B, respectively, with clade A further divided into lineage A1 (3 human strains) and lineage A2 (2 camel strains), and clade B divided into B1 to B6 (each containing both human and camel strains). Recombination analysis showed potential recombination events in five strains from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia, with recombination between lineage B5 and B3 in four strains, and between lineage B3 and B4 in one strain. The spike protein showed the highest number of amino acid substitutions, especially between A2 and other lineages, and contained positively selected codons. Notably, codon 1020 was positively selected among B and B5 strains, and can distinguish between clade A (Q1020) and B (R1020/H1020) strains, suggesting that this residue may play a role in the evolution of S protein during divergence of different lineages. The time of the most recent common ancestor of all MERS-CoV was dated to approximately 2010. The implications on the role of camels in the evolution of MERS-CoV are discussed.",

A novel lineage C betacoronavirus, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent of MERS [2, 3] . Subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa have implied that these animals are probably the reservoir for MERS-CoV [4] [5] [6] . In addition, the discovery of other closely related lineage C betacoronaviruses both before and after the MERS epidemic in various bat species and hedgehogs [7] [8] [9] [10] , as well as the demonstration of the ability of the spike protein of Tylonecteris bat CoV HKU4 to bind dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [11, 12] , the receptor of MERS-CoV, have also suggested that these animals could be the hosts for the ancestor of MERS-CoV. However, it is still uncertain how and when the ancestor of MERS-CoV may have jumped from bats/hedgehogs to camels and humans.",

It was observed that the amino acid substitutions observed by multiple alignments appeared to be randomly distributed throughout the structure (Figure 6 ). Based on the model, we did not observe specific evolutionary patterns of the MERS-CoV spike protein. However, intriguingly, the residue at position 1020 can distinguish between clade A and B (Figure 4 ). The glutamine (Q1020) and arginine residues (R1020) at that position are highly conserved in clade A and clade B, respectively, except for a histidine residue (H1020) found in 12 lineage B5 strains. Together with results from selective pressure analysis, this suggests that this amino acid residue may play a role during the molecular evolution of S protein of MERS-CoV and divergence of different lineages. 1224 and 1250 were also predicted to be positively selected sites among clade B strains by at least one method ( Table 2 ).

It was observed that the amino acid substitutions observed by multiple alignments appeared to be randomly distributed throughout the structure ( Figure 6 ). Based on the model, we did not observe specific evolutionary patterns of the MERS-CoV spike protein. However, intriguingly, the residue at position 1020 can distinguish between clade A and B (Figure 4 ). The glutamine (Q1020) and arginine residues (R1020) at that position are highly conserved in clade A and clade B, respectively, except for a histidine residue (H1020) found in 12 lineage B5 strains. Together with results from selective pressure analysis, this suggests that this amino acid residue may play a role during the molecular evolution of S protein of MERS-CoV and divergence of different lineages.

Such large number of genomes has given us a good opportunity to improve our understanding on the origin and evolution of the corresponding viruses. In contrast to the major SARS outbreak in 2003 which is of monophyletic origin, MERS-CoVs circulating in human and camels since 2012 originated from multiple sources in the Middle East and North Africa. For example, strains from a single country such as the UAE are present in lineages A2, B1, 3, 4, and 5, and strains from Jordan are also present in lineages A1, B4, and B5. This indicated that different MERS-CoV strains have resided in dromedaries in different countries with sporadic transmission to humans, sometimes causing fatal diseases. Overall, some minor recombination events between different sublineages (between B5 and B3, and between B3 and B4) might have occurred (Figures 5 and 6 ), but it seems that none of these events has resulted in significant changes in the genome. This is in contrast to some CoVs such as human CoV HKU1, human CoV OC43, or canine CoVs where recombination events are responsible for the generation of novel genotypes [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "While there is evidence suggesting that MERS-CoV may have infected camels for at least a few decades, it is intriguing that the present molecular clock analysis using available dated MERS-CoV genome sequences suggests a relatively recent common ancestor dated to approximately 2010. Based on existing evidence, there are two possibilities in the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV. The first possibility is that MERS-CoV has resided in camels for long time before infecting humans to cause the epidemic in 2012. The alternative hypothesis is that MERS-CoV has only emerged in camels recently from an unknown animal reservoir, and was spilled over to humans because of efficient receptor binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 when a sufficient proportion of camel population was infected. The first hypothesis is supported by two previous serological studies showing that MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in archived sera samples of dromedaries in Eastern Africa and Kenya can be detected as early as 1980s and 1990s [19, 20] . Moreover, the lack of positive selection at the receptor binding domain of spike protein of MERS-CoV may suggest the virus has been well adapted in camels and humans for a period of time. However, several questions were not readily answered by this hypothesis. First, since genomes of MERS-CoVs from humans and camels were intermingled and closely related without major adaptation before transmission to humans, one would expect similar camel-to-human transmission efficiency before the epidemic in 2012. However, no human cases before 2012 were reported so far, and more importantly, MERS-CoV has not been detected in any archived human or camel samples before 2012. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that early human cases may have been missed if they were not investigated for coronaviruses. Yet, if MERS-CoV has been circulating in camels for long time, one would expect a much earlier estimated tMRCA by molecular clock analysis using available MERS-CoV genome sequences. Although the present study may be limited by the lack of \"historical\" strains of MERS-CoV for analysis, the diverse circulating strains detected since 2012 should have reflected the history of evolution of MERS-CoV and allow a fair estimation of tMRCA. Nevertheless, isolation of MERS-CoV or detection of viral RNA from archived samples will be important to confirm if camels are indeed long-time reservoir of MERS-CoV.",

This may be a result of sampling bias or a genuine survival or transmission advantage of clade B MERS-CoV. As for the specific lineages, the S protein of lineage A2 MERS-CoV showed higher number of amino acid changes as compared to other lineages. After the virus has evolved into clades A and B, we speculate that lineage B5 diverged and evolved separately from the other clade B lineages, as demonstrated by its deep branch in the phylogenetic tree as well as the unique amino acid change at position 1020 of the S2 subunit in S protein (Figures 4 and 6) . Moreover, this residue at 1020 also distinguishes between clade A and B strains, and was positively selected among B and B5 strains, suggesting a role in the divergence of different lineages along the evolution of spike protein. Interestingly, this residue is located at the HR region of S2 which is responsible for virus-host fusion. Further studies have to be performed to understand whether clade B MERS-CoV have better survival advantages over clade A MERS-CoV, and the potential effect of amino acid substitution at codon 1020 on viral fusion.",

The major SARS outbreak in humans in early 2003 originated from a single or very few civet-to-human interspecies jumping events in Southern China, which explains the monophyletic evolution of strains involved in this outbreak. As a result, the epidemic was successfully controlled when the animal source was segregated from humans after closure of wild life wet markets in Southern China. On the other hand, MERS-CoV had been endemic in dromedary population in the Middle East during the outbreak in 2012 with many independent, sporadic camel-to-human transmission events in Saudi Arabia and the neighboring countries. Since MERS-CoV is found in dromedary calves in most countries in the Middle East and Africa, it would be impossible to control the disease by closure of a limited number of facilities in a restricted geographical region. For visitors to the Middle East, it is important to improve education so that they will avoid contacts with dromedaries, particularly dromedary calves. For residents of the Middle East, more viable options may be through the development of rapid laboratory diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines for treatment and prevention of MERS.",
