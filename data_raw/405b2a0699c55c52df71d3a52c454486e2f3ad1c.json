Based on cases recorded by a nation-wide paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) reporting system, the pre-pandemic (2005/06-2007/08), pandemic (2009/10) and post-pandemic (2010/ 11) annual incidence of severe influenza cases per 100,000 children below 15 or 17 years of age was estimated as 0.05, 0.8-1.0, and 0.4, respectively [18] [19] [20] . The data so far available indicated a shift towards younger children in A(H1N1)pdm09 cases from the pandemic to the first post-pandemic season [20] . In these studies, it remained unclear whether the higher pandemic and post-pandemic incidence in children was caused by higher influenza activity, heightened physician awareness, more frequent or more sensitive influenza testing, or a more severe course of disease of A(H1N1)pdm09 [18] . Furthermore, all these previous studies may have been affected by underreporting, as influenza cases were reported at the discretion of the PICU physician without systematic screening for influenza in patients with severe acute respiratory infection.",

At the central laboratory, they were tested using the commercial multiplex PCR 'FTD\u00ae Respiratory pathogens 21' (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) to screen for respiratory viruses (sensitivity and specificity of 99-100 % compared to singleplex PCR assays for all included viruses in clinical samples). Pathogens detected by the test kit included influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, coronavirus (CoV) NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RhV), enterovirus (EV), parechovirus (PV), and additionally Mykoplasma pneumoniae. Samples positive for influenza A and B virus RNA in the multiplex PCR were further analysed to determine the subtype and lineage, respectively. Primers and probes specific for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were included in the 'FTD Respiratory pathogens 21' kit. All samples positive for influenza A virus RNA but negative for influenza A virus (H1N1)pdm09 RNA were tested by a PCR specific for influenza A virus H3.",

These figures would, by extrapolation, correspond to a total number of 559 children with influenza-associated PICU admission in Germany within the 3-year post-pandemic period, with an annual average of 186 children. This is almost 28 times as high as the annual average of six to seven influenza-associated PICU admissions detected by nation-wide PICU surveillance in Germany during three pre-pandemic years without active screening [18] . Furthermore, the incidence estimates for the subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 derived from our active screening study were higher in the first and third post-pandemic seasons (1.35 and 1.17, respectively) than previous incidence estimates for PICU patients in the pandemic (0.8-1.0) and the first post-pandemic (approximately 0.4) season in Germany [19, 20] . Thus, our results indicate possible underreporting in previous studies, and show a continued high level of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions even 3 years after the pandemic. In our study, the proportions of children with bacteriaassociated complications (secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis) were similar to the proportions observed during the pre-pandemic period, but appeared higher than those observed during the pandemic 2009/10 [19] . The lower proportions observed during the pandemic might be explained by the time shift of the peak of influenza cases, which was observed as early as November 2009 in Germany [19] . Thus, the pandemic influenza peak did not coincide with the seasonal peak of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterial pathogen most frequently associated with community-acquired influenza [23] . Antiviral treatment patterns changed considerably during the post-pandemic period, with a decrease in the proportion of paediatric influenza cases receiving oseltamivir from previously 50 % [18] and 61 % [19] to 19 %. Oseltamivir is considered to be most advantageous when administered within the first 48 h of influenza disease. The reduced use in the post-pandemic period may therefore be partly due to the fact that median time between onset of influenza symptoms and PICU admission was longer than during the pandemic (3 vs. 2 days [19] ). Increasing uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the treatment of paediatric influenza may also have played a role [24, 25] . Post-pandemic oseltamivir treatment was associated with co-infections and longer PICU stay, suggesting that it were mainly children with severe complications or with serious underlying conditions who received this medication.",

A significant age shift towards younger children, from a median age of 5 to 3 years, had already been observed in a comparison of the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season in Germany [20] . The continued shift towards younger patients in the third season is likely to be due to increasing immunity in the older paediatric population, after previous contact with A(H1N1)pdm09. Seroprevalence data from Germany had already shown evidence for A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in as many as 25 % of children aged 1-4 years and 48 % of 5-17 year-old children for the pandemic season 2009/10 [26] . A similar shift towards younger hospitalized children [27, 28] and towards younger children with severe paediatric A(H1N1)pdm09-associated influenza from the pandemic season to the first post-pandemic season had also been detected in other European countries [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

For seasonal influenza, however, paediatric influenza vaccination was and is currently recommended only for specific risk groups with underlying chronic conditions [33] . Vaccination uptake was low, even in this target group. Pre-pandemic vaccination rates were 5 % for all children and about 15 % for children with chronic underlying conditions in 2007/2008 [34] . For the pandemic and post-pandemic seasons, no data on vaccination rates is available for children, but vaccination rates as low as 14 % (2009/10) and 11 % (2010/11) were reported for adults, with a vaccination rate of only 17 % even for risk group adults [35] . In our study, more than 75 % of influenzaassociated PICU patients were children with underlying chronic conditions. Analysis of their reported influenza [20] ). Data are given in %, by age group and season. Season 1: Oct10-Sep11 (n = 18), Season 3: Oct12-Sep13 (n = 13); Season 2: Oct11-Sep12 (n = 1) is not shown vaccination status showed that among these were a high proportion of vaccine-eligible but unvaccinated children. Patients with chronic conditions too young to be vaccinated and other paediatric risk groups, such as otherwise healthy children below 2 years of age, are not covered by the current German recommendation. All these groups could profit considerably from universal influenza vaccination for children, either directly or by herd protection. In contrast to the situation in Germany, in the United States universal influenza vaccination for all children older than 6 months of age has been established, and vaccination coverage reached a level of approximately 41 % in 2013 [36] . Compared to 348 influenza-associated paediatric deaths observed in the United States during the pandemic 2009/10, only 79 were observed in the strong A(H1N1)pdm09 season 2013/14 [37] . This might partly be explained by increasing immunity in children after previous A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, but may in part also be a result of the influenza vaccination program [37] . In England, a universal childhood vaccination programme with a new live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) with intra-nasal application was started in the 2013/14 influenza season [38] . First results showed an overall uptake of 53 % in primary school aged children, indicating a good acceptance of LAIV, and suggesting direct and indirect impacts on disease incidence, including reduction of paediatric influenza-associated hospitalisations.",

The strengths of our study include the multicentre design covering the majority of PICUs in Bavaria, the active screening for influenza in patients admitted to PICUs, and PCR-confirmation of all influenza cases. A limitation is that the corrected incidence estimates were based on the assumption that participating and nonparticipating PICUs treated a similar number of severe paediatric influenza patients. Although PICUs of both groups were of similar size, some of the non-participating PICUs, where paediatricians indicated lack of time as reason for non-participation, may have treated a higher number of patients, or patients with higher acuity. Further limitations include potential over-and underreporting in participating PICUs. On the one hand, due to different hospitalization rules some children may have been admitted to PICUs mainly for the purpose of monitoring their course of influenza disease more closely, thus resulting in an overestimate of severe cases. On the other hand, some parents of children with severe influenza may have refused study participation, or children with a fulminant course of influenza disease may have died before they were admitted to a PICU [4] . Thus, the high incidence estimates derived in this study may still underestimate the true burden of severe influenza. [19] b Key data from this study were pooled with data from Streng et al. 2011 [18] and compared using Fisher's Exact test or Mann-Whitney U-test, respectively",

Both incidence estimates were higher than those previously reported by nation-wide PICU surveillance for the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season, suggesting possible underreporting in previous studies without active screening. Comparison of the first and third post-pandemic seasons indicated an age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children, which might be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population. The large proportion of children with underlying chronic conditions indicates the need for a more consistent implementation of the current recommendations for influenza vaccination of specific risk groups in Germany. These children could also profit from herd protection, if universal influenza vaccination was successfully introduced in Germany.
