Upon ST8Sia I expression, mAb\u00c4CASD1 UM4D4-positive bands were observed in ganglioside extracts of HEK293T wt but not of HEK293T cells (b1). The mobility of these bands on the TLC plate indicated the formation of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides of the neolacto series, with the upper band co-migrating with non-O-acetylated GD3 as described for 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactotetraosylceramide . Pre-treatment of TLC plates with mild alkali to induce a 14,15 shift of O-acetyl groups from C7 to C9 did not result in the appearance of additional UM4D4-positive bands in the HEK293T samples (b2). This was also true for the plate shown in (b1) after additional mild alkali treatment and a second round of mAb UM4D4 staining (b1a), although this procedure was accompanied by high background staining. Immunostaining with anti-CD60c mAb U5 (b3) revealed binding of this mAb to the 7-O-acetylated GD3 standard, but also demonstrated cross-reactivity with non-modified GD3 as described 16 previously . Similarly, a slight cross-reactivity of anti-GD3 mAb R24 with 7-O-acetylated GD3 was observed 16 (b4) as noted before . However, based on their migration compared to the standards, the single bands detected with mAb U5 (b3) and mAb R24 (b4) in ganglioside extracts from ST8Sia I expressing HEK293T wt \u00c4CASD1 and HEK293T cells can be assigned to non-O-acetylated GD3.
