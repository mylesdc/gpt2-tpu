            "text": "Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage-and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ,16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR,0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible ''selection histories'' of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissuespecific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.",

            "text": "Positive darwinian selection is an important source of evolutionary innovation and a major force behind the divergence of species. The Neutralist-Selectionist debate of the past 30 years has gradually given way to a general consensus that both neutral drift and positive selection play major roles in evolutionary change. Interest has therefore shifted to questions of which genes positive selection has affected, how strong was the effect, when did it occur, and what were its functional consequences. Heightening interest in these questions is a growing appreciation that methods for detecting positive selection can also be valuable tools for gaining insight into gene function [1] . Consequently, a wide variety of methods for detecting positively selected genes (PSGs) have been introduced, including comparative or phylogenetic methods, which make use of patterns of substitutions between species, and population genetic methods, which primarily rely on patterns of intraspecies polymorphism [2, 3] . Using these techniques, strong evidence of positive selection has been found for various genes in various organisms, including many genes involved in sensory perception, immunity, host-pathogen interactions, and reproduction (reviewed in [1, 3] ).",

            "text": "Phylogenetic and population genetic methods for detecting positive selection serve as complementary tools for functional and evolutionary analysis. These methods operate at different time scales, with phylogenetic methods being best suited for detecting selection that operates over relatively long periods in evolutionary history, and population genetic methods being best suited for detecting more recent selection. Population genetic methods can potentially detect selection operating at individual sites, through the effects of linkage with flanking alleles, while phylogenetic methods generally require multiple sites to have been affected in a sequence of interest. At the same time, decay of linkage disequilibrium at longer evolutionary time scales can allow phylogenetic methods to more accurately pinpoint the specific locations of functionally important substitutions. In some cases, phylogenetic methods also allow such substitutions to be mapped to particular branches of a phylogenetic tree, thereby providing useful insights about the evolutionary histories of the sequences in question.",

Within mammals, several genome-wide scans for positive selection on protein-coding genes have been conducted, using both phylogenetic [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and population genetic [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] methods (reviewed in [16] ). These analyses have identified many new genes showing strong evidence of positive selection and have revealed striking differences in the prevalence of positive selection on different lineages and among different classes of genes. For example, it has been reported that PSGs are enriched for roles in sensory perception, immunity and defense, tumor suppression, apoptosis, and spermatogenesis [4, 5] ; that PSGs are associated with known Mendelian disorders [4] ; that PSGs often coincide with segmental duplications [8] ; and that more genes have undergone positive selection in chimpanzee evolution than in human evolution [9] . Genome-wide scans for PSGs have also helped to stimulate interest in detecting positive selection on noncoding sequences and on gene expression [17, 18, 19, 20] .",

The phylogenetic depth of this data set helps considerably in addressing the problem of weak power. Indeed, these genomes have a near-optimal degree of divergence for PSG detection, being distant enough to produce a strong phylogenetic signal, yet close enough that gene structures are well conserved, alignment is fairly straightforward, and synonymous substitutions are not saturated (e.g., [25] ). In addition, our data set for the first time allows positive selection of mammalian genes to be examined genome-wide on a nontrivial phylogeny, so that insight can be gained into the particular ''selection histories'' of individual genes-that is, the branches of the phylogeny on which they experienced positive selection. In our analysis, we employ models of codon substitution that account for variation of selective pressure over branches on the tree and across sites in a sequence, which can capture signatures of molecular adaptation that affect small numbers of sites [26, 27] . Using a series of likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) based on these models, we identify more than four hundred genes that show strong signatures of positive selection during mammalian evolution. Our detailed analysis of the functional roles, selection histories, and expression patterns of these genes follows.",

These ortholog sets (human genes and non-human orthologs) were identified by an automatic pipeline that made use of syntenic whole-genome alignments, sequence quality scores, and other data (see Methods). Briefly, the pipeline began with 21,115 human genes drawn from the RefSeq [28] , UCSC Known Genes [29] , and VEGA [30] gene sets. These genes were mapped to the other genomes via syntenic pairwise alignments, then passed through a series of rigorous filters to ensure correct mapping, high sequence quality, and only minimal changes between species in gene structure. This approach exploits the fact that gene structures are generally well-conserved between mammalian species [22] and avoids any dependency on the non-human gene annotations, which-with the exception of mouse-are significantly less accurate and complete than those for human. Because low-quality sequence can produce a spurious signal for positive selection (e.g., [8] ), all bases with low quality scores (Phred quality ,20) were masked out for subsequent analyses. Masking (or truncation at the 59 or 39 end) was also used to exclude regions of genes in which minor differences in gene structure were apparent. Genes that showed signs of substantial disruptions to their exon-intron structures or open reading frames in one or more species (perhaps indicating pseudogenization) were masked out completely in those species. All masked bases were treated as missing data in the subsequent analysis of positive selection. This masking approach allowed the number of genes to be maximized while ensuring that the analyzed alignments were of high quality (Table 1) .",

This simplified the analysis, allowed for parameter sharing across genes (see Methods), and eliminated an important source of error by avoiding the need for a separate tree reconstruction for each gene family. (All ortholog sets were assumed to obey the species tree shown in Figure 1 ; because only an unrooted tree is needed, the topology is well accepted.) It was therefore necessary to discard any genes that showed evidence of recent duplication. This was accomplished in a pairwise fashion, by examining each human gene and orthologous non-human gene, and determining-based on BLAST matches to other genes and gene predictions in the same genome-whether either gene had a paralog that was more similar to it than the two orthologs",

Many mutations have essentially no effect on organismal fitness and can become fixed only by the stochastic process of neutral drift. However, some mutations produce a selective advantage that boosts their chances of reaching fixation. Genes in which new mutations tend to be beneficial, rather than neutral or deleterious, tend to evolve rapidly and are said to be under positive selection. Genes involved in immunity and defense are a well-known example; rapid evolution in these genes presumably occurs because new mutations help organisms to prevail in evolutionary ''arms races'' with pathogens. Many mammalian genes show evidence of positive selection, but open questions remain about the overall impact of positive selection in mammals. For example, which key differences between species can be attributed to positive selection? How have patterns of selection changed across the mammalian phylogeny? What are the effects of population size and gene expression patterns on positive selection? Here we attempt to shed light on these and other questions in a comprehensive study of ,16,500 genes in six mammalian genomes.",

As in previous studies, the numbers of genes identified by the tests for individual primate branches were small, primarily due to weak power caused by low levels of interspecies divergence. The inclusion of additional non-primate mammals does not appear to have improved the power of these tests substantially, but it does allow a distinction to be made between selection on the branches to the hominids and to macaque. The tests for selection on the branch to the primates and in the primate clade also yielded fairly small numbers of PSGs, but the tests for selection in, or on the branch to, the rodents identified somewhat (nearly three-fold) larger numbers. In general, even with the larger data set, our power to detect selection on individual lineages and clades is still fairly weak, and differences in numbers of identified PSGs almost certainly reflect differences in power more than differences in the prevalence of selection. Nevertheless, these LRTs together produced a fairly large set of high-confidence PSGs, permitting a more detailed and thorough functional analysis than has previously been possible in mammals (see below).",

However, the increased power of our analysis allows biological processes and functions associated with positive selection to be identified at much finer resolution than in previous analyses, as discussed below. The increased power also seems to diminish the dependency of functional enrichments on the database or statistical methodology selected for the analysis. In particular, better agreement was observed between functional categories over-represented among the identified PSGs, as determined by Fisher's exact test (FET), and categories whose genes displayed significant shift toward smaller LRT P-values (whether or not they met the significance threshold for PSGs), as determined by the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test (see Methods). Better agreement was also observed between analyses based on the GO and PANTHER databases (see Tables S2 and S3 ). The observed enrichments do not appear to be an artifact of differences between categories in gene length or alignment depth per gene (Text S1).

A striking example is the complement immunity system, a biochemical cascade responsible for the elimination of pathogens. This system consists of several small proteins found in the blood that cooperate to kill target cells by disrupting their plasma membranes. Of 28 genes associated with this pathway in KEGG [33] , nine are identified as PSGs (FDR,0.05), and five others have nominal P,0.05 ( Figure S1 ). Most of these PSGs are inhibitors (DAF, CFH, CFI) and receptors (C5AR1, CR2), but some are part of the membrane attack complex (C7, C9, C8A), which punctures cell membranes to initiate cell lysis. Many of these PSGs are known to interact with one another, suggesting possible co-evolution. Two of three biochemical pathways known to activate the complement system are also enriched for PSGs (the classical complement pathway [P = 6.1610 27 ] and the alternative complement pathway [P = 1.5610 26 ]), as is the coagulation cascade that interacts with the complement system (''blood clotting,'' MWU P = 2.2610 27 ; Table S3 ). Other pathways that contain multiple interacting PSGs include those for apoptosis, taste transduction, antigen processing and presentation, and cytokine-and chemokine-mediated signaling (e.g., Figures. S4, S5) .",

A detailed examination of one immunoglobulin gene for which structural information was available-a cellsurface receptor for hepatitis A and other viruses called HAVCR1 (LRT P = 6.9610 29 )-revealed several sites under positive selection in its N-terminal V-like immunoglobulin (IgV) domain. Three of these sites correspond to regions of the protein believed to play critical roles in binding to viruses or in regulating the immune function of the gene (Figure 3 ). In addition to its role in viral defense, HAVCR1 is a key player in the hygiene hypothesis explaining the increase in allergies and asthma [35] .

This association of immunity, fertilization, and cytolysis is driven by a group of genes that participate in sperm-egg interaction, but also have immune-related functions and destroy pathogens by cytolysis. Interestingly, PSGs with roles in both reproduction and immunity are often also related to cancer, and it has been hypothesized that most cancer genes under positive selection have been subject to antagonistic co-evolution, with lineage-specific variations in dynamics and strength [5, 37] . Several PSGs identified here are associated with both FAS/p53 apoptosis and cancer (Da Fonseca et al., in prep.), such as the protein p53, which also regulates maternal reproduction [38] ; the cell adhesion gene ADAM2 (P = 2.9610 26 ), which is integral to fertilization [39] ; and the related genes ADAM15 (P = 5.4610 24 ) and ADAM29 (P = 3.4610 24 ), which are strong candidates for cancer evolution driven by sexual conflict.

Among the most inclusive categories of this type are ''sensory perception of chemical stimulus'' (24 PSGs; P = 4.3610 239 ) and ''G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway'' (39 PSGs; P = 1.4610 27 ). Previously, enrichments for such categories have been attributed primarily to olfactory receptors [4, 5] . Indeed, 15 PSGs are labeled as having ''olfactory receptor activity'' (P = 6.9610 236 ). However, eight PSGs are involved in ''sensory perception of taste,'' including five taste receptors (P = 1.4610 210 ). Interestingly, several of these are bitter taste receptors. The sense of bitter taste is critical in allowing organisms to avoid toxic and harmful substances, and extensive gene expansion of bitter taste receptors is known to have occurred during mammalian evolution [41] , possibly driven by (or helping to drive) positive selection. Bitter taste receptors under positive selection include TAS2R1, TAS2R5, and a recently expanded cluster of genes at chr12p13 (TAS2R13, TAS2R14, TAS2R42, and TAS2R49). Another PSG, TAS1R2, is a receptor of sweet and umami taste, and the PSG RTP3 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in the transport of taste receptors and apparently influences their expression. The PSGs in the ''neurological processes'' category (P = 7.5610 27 ) are dominated by olfactory and taste receptors, but they also include other types of genes. For example, TMC2 (P = 1.1610 24 ) is expressed in the inner ear and is important for balance and hearing [42] . The acid-sensing ion channel gene ACCN4 (P = 1.0610 26 ) has been implicated in synaptic transmission, pain perception, and mechanoperception [43] . SLC6A5 (P = 3.0610 24 ) is associated with hyperekplexia, a neurological disorder characterized by an excessive startle response [44] . The neuromedin receptor NMUR (P = 6.1610 24 ) is involved in the mammalian circadian oscillator system [45, 46] . Finally, the neurotensin receptor NTSR1 (P = 8.1610 24 ) mediates hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, antinociception, and regulation of intestinal motility and secretion [47] .",

However, the more powerful LRTs, such as those for the primate and rodent clades ( Figure 1C ,E), did produce significantly lower P-values for genes of certain functional categories than for others. Interestingly, these categories were dramatically different for the primate-and rodentclade LRTs, with nearly all of the primate categories relating to sensory perception, and nearly all of the rodent categories relating to immunity and defense (Table 4) . Indeed, the PSGs identified by the primate-clade test include several taste and olfactory receptors, as well as receptors for the sensation of pain (e.g., MRGPRE, NPFF2) and color vision (e.g., OPN1SW), and receptors involved in immunity (e.g., CCR1). The PSGs identified by the rodent-clade test include few such genes, but they include many genes involved in responses to wounding, inflammation, and stress, as well as genes involved in complement activation and innate immunity. Thus, we find little evidence that genes directly involved in brain development and function have (as a group) been driven by positive selection in primates, but many genes that provide sensory showing the interaction between two receptors that have been implicated in the regulation of HAVCR1's immune function. It is thought that clustering of receptors within the same cell surface might facilitate phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail, and that interaction between receptors from different cells might be a mechanism for B-T cell adhesion [91] . Predicted residue 39 falls within the region of these receptors, very near residue 37, which directly interacts with the opposite receptor (according to the available mouse structure). In addition, predicted residues 54 and 56 are adjacent to the virus-binding surface (shown in pink), as defined by a polymorphism in macaque [91] . Interestingly, the residue that falls between them (55) appears to be critical for virus-binding at the homologous loop in the CEA coronavirus receptor [91] . Residue 75 in the IgV domain also shows evidence of positive selection (PP.0.90, shown in orange) but its function is unknown. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000144.g003 information to the brain do appear to have experienced positive selection. These changes in sensory perception could conceivably have been brought on by, or could have contributed to, increased brain size and complexity in primates.",

A selection history is defined as an assignment to each branch of the phylogeny of one of two evolutionary modes: positive selection (each site evolves with v 0 ,1, v 0 = 1, or v 2 .1) or absence of positive selection (each site evolves with v 0 ,1 or v 0 = 1). The model allows a posterior distribution over selection histories to be inferred for each gene, and it allows for estimates of the number of genes under positive selection on individual branches and clades that consider uncertainty about selection histories. Unlike the branch-and clade-specific LRTs-which are simple one-sided hypothesis tests and are necessarily conservative about rejection of the null hypothesis-this model considers all candidate histories symmetrically, and allows for ''soft'' (probabilistic), rather than absolute, choices of history at each gene.",

It has separate parameters for the rates of gain and loss of positive selection at several switch points on the tree, with two switch points per internal branch and one per external branch (see Figure 4A and Methods). The joint posterior distribution of these parameters and of all selection histories is inferred from the data by a Gibbs sampling algorithm (see Methods and Text S1). The inference procedure is computationally intensive, so it was applied only to the 544 genes identified by one or more LRTs as showing significant evidence of positive selection. Because in these cases the null model of no positive selection had already been rejected by a conservative test, the history without selection on any branch was excluded, leaving 2 9 21 = 511 possible histories for the nine-branch (unrooted) phylogeny. To reduce computational cost, the inference of selection histories was conditioned on the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the codon models (see Methods).",

These rates are sharply reduced for the external branches of the tree, probably in large part because of diminished power to detect changes in selective mode on these branches. The number of genes inferred to be under selection also varies by branch, but not as dramatically, with expected values ranging between 207.9 and 393.9 and many 95% credible intervals overlapping ( Figure 4B ). Despite differences at individual branches, gains and losses appear to be roughly in equilibrium overall, with 61% of genes estimated to have been under selection at the root, and between 38% and 62% (averaging 50%) under selection at the leaves. The slight tendency to lose selection over time could reflect an ascertainment bias for genes that experienced selection early in mammalian evolution, which will tend to display signatures of selection on multiple long branches of the tree and therefore will be more easily detectable by the LRTs. The branches with the most genes under selection (such as those leading to the rodent and primate ancestors, and to dog and macaque) are generally long (see Figure 1A ), suggesting power may influence these estimates. Nevertheless, the unusually high rate of gain on the branch to the rodents, and the comparatively low rate of loss on that branch (both having fairly low posterior variance; Figure S2 ), suggest not just differences in power but a real tendency for a net gain of selection on this branch, perhaps due to larger population sizes in the rodents. Whether because of power or a genuine increase in selection, the rodent branch appears to play a major role in the identification of PSGs. An expected 72% of the 544 candidate PSGs are under selection on this branch.",

Instead, most genes appear to have switched between evolutionary modes multiple times.

An expected 91% of PSGs have experienced at least one mode switch, and an expected 53% have experienced two or more switches. 54% of PSGs have 95% CIs excluding zero switches (i.e., with high confidence, these genes have switched modes at least once), and 10% have 95% CIs also excluding one switch (with high confidence, they have switched modes at least twice). Thus, this analysis suggests that positive selection tends to be gained and lost relatively frequently in mammalian genes. Episodic positive selection has been observed and analyzed in detail at individual loci (e.g., [52, 53] ) but to our knowledge genome-wide evidence of this phenomenon in mammalian phylogenies has not previously been reported.

            "text": "In addition to being useful in a bulk statistical analysis of all PSGs, the Bayesian framework can be used to identify the single most likely selection history for each gene. In some cases, these histories are consistent with known functional differences between species, and help to shed light on the evolutionary basis of these differences. For example, the sweet receptor TAS1R2 has been shown in knock-out experiments to be responsible for differences between species in preferences for sweet tastes [55] . (Humans can taste several natural and artificial sweeteners that mice cannot, such as monellin, thaumatin, aspartame, and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone.) This gene is predicted to have experienced selection on the primate clade and on the branches leading to the primate and rodent clades (posterior probability [PP] = 0.20), suggesting that positive selection on TAS1R2 in both primates and rodents could have contributed to differences in sweet taste preferences. Another example is the integral membrane glycoprotein GYPC, which plays an important role in regulating the mechanical stability of red blood cells. In humans, GYPC has been associated with malaria susceptibility, and predicted to have undergone recent positive selection [56] . However, we find evidence that GYPC has experienced positive selection on all branches of the primate clade (PP = 0.66), suggesting longer-term selective pressure that have also affected nonhuman primates. A third example is CGA, which encodes the alpha subunit of the four human glycoprotein hormones (chorionic gonadotropin, luteiniz-ing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone). This gene shows strong evidence of positive selection specific to the primate clade (PP = 0.82), consistent with the proposal that relatively recent adaptations in pregnancy and development have played a critical role in the evolution of the human endocrine system [57] . Interestingly, the closely related genes CGB1 and CGB2 (which encode two of the six beta subunits of chorionic gonadotropin) are thought to have originated by gene duplication in the common ancestor of humans and great apes [58] , and these events could have contributed to positive selection on CGA. Finally, the complement components C7 and C8B, which encode proteases in the membrane attack complex, are predicted with high probability to be under selection in rodents only (C7: PP = 0.98 for selection in mouse; C8B: PP = 0.93 for selection in mouse and rat). Differences in complement proteases are thought to explain certain differences in the immune responses of humans and rodents [59] .",

Our most striking finding was that PSGs show reduced expression levels in all of the 11 available tissues (breast, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, prostate, spleen, testes, and thyroid; see Methods). In particular, a significantly smaller fraction of PSGs than of non-PSGs produce a hybridization signal above the background level for the array (P,4610 24 in all tissues for PSGs defined by the all-branch test, one-sided FET). Moreover, among genes expressed above background, expression levels are significantly lower for PSGs than for non-PSGs (P,7610 25 in all tissues, one-sided MWU test; Figures 5A-C) . PSGs also show significantly greater tissue bias than non-PSGs, as measured by the statistic t [61] ( Figure 5D ) or by an alternative statistic here denoted c [17] (Methods). The differences in expression level and tissue bias between the two sets of genes do not appear to be explained by differences in false negative or false positive rates in the detection of positive selection, and the differences in expression level do not appear to be a consequence of the differences in tissue bias (Text S1). In addition, the observed differences remain if the genes that belong to strongly enriched GO categories (Table 2) are excluded, indicating they cannot be attributed to particular classes of PSGs known to have tissue-specific expression patterns, such as those involved in immunity or spermatogenesis. That expression levels are reduced in all tissues further suggests the existence of a general relationship between expression patterns and the likelihood of positive selection.",

In addition, we observed a positive correlation of v with tissue bias, as measured by t (r = 0.24) [63, 64] . (Similar correlations were observed when the log likelihood ratio in the test for positive selection on any branch-which increases with increasing evidence for selection-was used in place of v.) Unlike in previous studies, however, we were able to examine these correlations separately for positively and non-positively selected genes, using the set of PSGs identified by the all-branches LRT. Interestingly, the correlations of v with expression level t are much stronger within the non-PSGs than within the PSGs, indicating that the observed correlations are primarily driven by negative rather than positive selection (see also [65] ). Thus, while genes expressed at low levels and/or in a tissue-specific manner show an increased tendency to have experienced positive selection, the strength of positive selection does not appear to be strongly correlated with their expression patterns (see Discussion).",

Based on this designation, spleen-and testes-specific genes were strongly enriched for PSGs: 22 of 174 (12.6%) spleenspecific genes were PSGs, compared with only 2.2% of other genes (P = 8.7610 211 , one-sided FET); and 45 of 715 (6.3%) testesspecific genes were PSGs, compared with 2.1% of other genes (P = 8.2610 210 ). There were also significant, but weaker, enrichments for PSGs among liver-specific (P = 9.1610 23 ) and breastspecific (P = 1.0610 22 ) genes. Not surprisingly, the spleen-specific PSGs generally appear to be immune-related, and many of the testes-specific PSGs are involved in spermatogenesis or sperm adhesion (they include ADAM2 and SPAM1; Table 3 ). The liver and breast specific genes are more heterogeneous. In contrast, only 2 of 254 (0.7%) cerebellum-specific genes were PSGs, compared with 2.3% of other genes (P = 0.066, one-sided FET). Only a few tissue-specific genes were identified by the clade tests, so it was not possible to compare the relationships between tissue-specific expression and positive selection in primates versus rodents. However, there were significant enrichments for primate PSGs among spleen-specific genes, and for rodent PSGs among testesspecific genes.",

We estimated a separate nonsynonymous-synonymous rate ratio v for each branch of the six-species phylogeny, pooling data from all ortholog sets ( Figure 1A) . Consistent with previous findings [6, 8] , we observe that protein-coding genes, on average, have experienced moderately strong purifying selection (v \u00ab 1) on all branches of the phylogeny, but that estimates of v vary considerably within the mammals. These estimates are largest for the hominids (v<0.25), smallest for the non-primate mammals (0.12,v#0.14), and intermediate for non-hominid primates (0.17,v,0.21). It is thought that increased estimates of v in hominids primarily result from weakened purifying selection, owing to reduced effective population sizes [69, 5] . The intermediate values for non-hominid primates may also be influenced by population size.",

This relationship allows ratios of population sizes to be estimated from ratios of v estimates, under the assumption of constant selection coefficients across species. Here we further assumed that the ancestral population sizes of humans and the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes versus (to which the sequenced animal belonged) were roughly the same (N h = N c ) [5] , and estimated the ratio of v m in macaque to v h in human/chimpanzee from our 10,980 humanchimpanzee-macaque ortholog trios. Our estimate of v m / v h = 0.732 implies an estimate for the ratio of the macaque to human ancestral population sizes of N m / N h = 1.41 [bootstrapping 95% CI (1.15, 1.64)]. In comparison, the ancestral macaque population size has been estimated at ,73,000 [72] and ancestral human and chimpanzee population sizes at 40,000-70,000 [73, 74] , which would imply a ratio of 1.04-1.82, in reasonable agreement with our estimate. We used the same theoretical relationship to devise a LRT indicating whether or not each gene deviated significantly from the assumed model with N m / N h = 1.41 (Methods). For the vast majority (96%) of the 10,980 genes examined, no significant deviation was observed, indicating that the differences in selection pressure in macaque and the hominids are generally well-explained by differences in population size.",

These experiments show that power increases substantially when the set of species under consideration is expanded from the two hominid species to the three primates then to all six mammals. With hominid species only, power is poor even when selection is quite strong (e.g., ,20% with a constant v = 2 and ,40% with v = 4), suggesting that a genome-wide scan will tend to identify only the most extreme cases of positive selection. If a rigorous correction for multiple testing is applied, a test based on hominids only has essentially no power, even for fairly long genes under strong selection ( Figure S3 ; see also [5] ). The situation is considerably improved by the addition of the macaque genome, but power remains poor when controlling for multiple testing unless genes are long and selection is strong. When all six mammals are considered, however, power increases substantially. With the full data set, power is reasonably good ($70%) even when genes are short and selection is moderate in strength; it remains good when multiple comparisons are considered ( Figure S3 ). The absolute estimates of power from these experiments depend on the simplifying assumptions used in the simulations (including the unrealistic assumption of constant v among lineages and among sites), and they must be interpreted cautiously. However, estimates of relative power-which will be less sensitive to these simplifying assumptions-indicate a substantial improvement is achieved by the addition of the three non-primate mammals.",

These studies have provided a valuable initial assessement of the genome-wide landscape of positive selection in mammals, but they have left many important questions unanswered. The analysis presented here, by incorporating non-primate mammalian genomes into a genome-wide scan for positive selection, represents a significant step forward. The larger, more divergent group of species improves power significantly, and the use of a nontrivial phylogeny provides insight into the particular patterns of positive selection that have helped to shape present-day genes. To our knowledge this is the largest and most detailed genome-wide analysis of positive selection to date, not only in mammals but in any group of organisms (although extensive analyses, similar in some respects, have been performed recently in Drosophila [75, 76] ).",

Examples include the classical and alternative pathways for complement-mediated immunity and the FAS/p53 apoptotic pathway ( Figures S1, S4 and S5). These findings suggest that positive selection may frequently act directly on whole protein complexes or pathways (see [77, 78] ). Alternatively, adaptive changes in one protein may sometimes have a cascade effect, leading to changes in other genes that bring a system back into equilibrium. Whether or not all changes affecting a pathway are driven by positive selection, one might expect to see similarities in the selection histories of gene with closely related functions. Indeed, we have found that genes with similar selection histories on average have substantially greater similarity in their GO categories than do genes with more divergent histories ( Figure S6 ). The observations that multiple interacting genes often show evidence of positive selection and that positive selection is frequently episodic may well be connected. For example, in some cases a transient external force could induce a burst of changes in multiple genes that participate in the same pathway, either separately or by triggering a cascade of interdependent events. Further unraveling the (co-)evolutionary histories of interacting PSGs promises to be a fertile area for future Table 3 . Summary of individual PSGs discussed in this article.",

Care will be required to distinguish between true coevolution and correlations that can be explained by dependencies on expression levels or other covariates of evolutionary rate [79] . Our finding that PSGs are expressed at lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs is consistent with a well-known negative correlation v with expression level, and a positive correlation of v with tissue bias (t or c). Various explanations have been proposed for the observed decrease in v among genes expressed at high levels and/or expressed broadly across tissues, including selection for translational efficiency, selection against misfolding, or increased selection due to pleiotropy [62, 68, 65] . In any case, these genes do appear to experience a reduction in their evolutionary ''flexibility'' compared with genes expressed at low levels and/or nonuniformly across tissues. Our observation of decreased rates of positive selection among these genes-and increased rates among lowexpression/high-tissue-bias genes-is consistent with this characterization. Interestingly, however, we observe that correlations of v with expression level and t hold strongly within non-PSGs, but are much less pronounced within PSGs. Thus, expression levels and patterns are strongly correlated with both the strength of negative selection and the likelihood of positive selection, but they are only weakly correlated with the strength of positive selection. It appears that genes may be more likely to come under positive selection if they are in a state of evolutionary flexibility brought on by reduced or tissue-specific expression, but once positive selection has taken hold their subsequent evolutionary course is not strongly dependent on their expression patterns.",

            "text": "As additional mammalian genomes become available, the statistical power to detect positive selection will improve. However, most forthcoming genomes are being sequenced at low coverage, and will inevitably exhibit increased levels of error in base calls, genome assemblies, ortholog identification (due to short contigs), and alignment-all of which can lead to spurious signals for positive selection. (The same errors tend to produce false negatives, rather than false positives, in the identification of conserved elements.) Thus, careful data quality controls will be needed to take advantage of these data. In addition, when considering the impact of additional sequences on statistical power, it is useful to distinguish between positive selection that acts continuously (or in recurrent episodes) over a long evolutionary period, and positive selection that acts transiently or in a lineagespecific manner. Deep phylogenetic sequencing should generally improve detection power for continuous or recurrent positive selection, but power for transient selection depends strongly on the sequenced species and the lineages of interest. For example, the genome sequences of a dozen non-primate mammals will likely have little effect on the power to detect human-specific selection, while the gorilla and neanderthal genomes could help considerably. There are fundamental limitations in the detection of weak, transient, or highly localized positive selection that will not be overcome by any amount of genome sequencing. Nevertheless, the availability of several new primate genomes, including those of the orangutan, marmoset, and gorilla, may significantly improve power for PSGs in primates.",

As additional sequence data becomes available, it will become possible to associate selection with individual residues of proteins with greater accuracy. At the same time, more data is becoming available on the specific functional roles of individual amino acids, for example, from structural or mutagenesis studies. As a result, it will increasingly become possible to find direct links between selection and function. Often these links will initially be tentative, as in our site-specific analysis of the HAVCR1 gene. Nevertheless, they provide a valuable starting point for experimental follow-up. At the same time, more can be done to incorporate non-sequence data-such as structural and expression data-into computational methods for detecting positive selection. Thus, improvements in both computational and experimental methods will be needed to establish deeper and more informative connections between evolutionary dynamics and molecular function.",

Transcripts that lacked annotated coding regions (CDSs), that had CDSs of ,100 bp, or that had CDSs whose lengths were not multiples of three were discarded, leaving 88,879 nonredundant transcripts. These transcripts were grouped by same-stranded CDS overlap into 21,115 genes (transcript clusters). All transcripts were mapped from human to each of the other five mammalian species via the syntenic alignments, then subjected to a series of filters designed to minimize the impact of annotation errors, sequence quality, and changes in gene structure on subsequent analyses. Briefly, each human transcript was required (1) to map to the non-human genome via a single chain of sequence alignments including $80% of its CDS; (2) after mapping to a non-human species, to have #10% of its CDS in sequencing gaps or low quality sequence; (3) to have no frame-shift indels, unless they were compensated for within 15 bases; (4) to have no in-frame stop codons and to have all splice sites conserved. To allow for genes that are mostly conserved but whose start or stop codons have shifted, incomplete transcripts-with ,10% of bases removed from the 59 and 39 ends of the CDS-were also considered. The final collection of ortholog sets was obtained by selecting, for each gene, the (complete or incomplete) transcript that successfully mapped to the largest number of non-human species. In the case of a tie, the transcript with the greatest total CDS length was selected. This procedure resulted in 17,489 genes with $2 non-human orthologs, averaging ,5 species per gene (including human; see Table 1 ).",

However, to reduce the number of parameters estimated per gene, the complete set of 17,489 genes was divided into eight equally sized classes by G+C content in third codon positions. The branch lengths and the transition-transversion rate ratio k were estimated for each class under the null model, and these estimates were subsequently held fixed, in a G+C dependent way, for the LRTs. Instead of a complete set of branch lengths, a single scale parameter m was estimated per gene. Thus, only the parameters m, v 0 ,1 and p 0 for the null model and the additional parameters v 2 .1 and p 1 for the alternative model, were estimated per gene (see [31, 26] ).

The four possible values of (V nb , W nb ) correspond to four possible scenarios at P nbgain of selection (0,1), loss of selection (1,0), absence of gain (0,0), or absence of loss (1,1). The probabilities of these scenarios (i.e., the conditional probability of each W nb given V nb ) are defined by a parameter for gains (h nbG ) and a parameter for losses (h nbL ) at each point. In addition, the prior probability of selection at the root of the tree is given by a parameter h 0 . (For this analysis, the most recent common ancestor of the primates and rodents is treated as the root of the tree; see Text S1.) The set of parameters can thus be described as h~h nbe :",
