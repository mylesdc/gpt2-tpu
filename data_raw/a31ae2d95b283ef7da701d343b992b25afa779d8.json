It was not clear if these differences were due to changes in genomic sequence, the protein sequence or the frequency of frameshifting. Here, viruses with synonymous codon changes are shown to produce different ratios of genomic and subgenomic RNA. These findings demonstrate that the protein sequence is not the primary cause of altered genomic and subgenomic RNA production. The synonymous codon changes affect both the structure of the frameshift signal and frameshifting efficiency. Small differences in frameshifting efficiency result in dramatic differences in genomic RNA production and TCID 50 suggesting that the frameshifting frequency must stay above",

The proteins encoded in ORF1a and ORF1a/b function as the replicase, making subgenomic RNAs and new copies of the genomic RNA [5] . Production of the pp1ab polyprotein requires the translating ribosome to change reading frame at the frameshift signal that bridges ORF1a and ORF1a/b. Like most viral frameshift signals, frameshifting at the coronavirus signal leads to expression of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a protein essential for viral replication (for review, see [6] ). The proteins upstream of the frameshift signal include the predicted proteases and other uncharacterized proteins [5] . We have previously suggested that the ratio of the pp1a and pp1ab proteins might affect the regulation and production of genomic and subgenomic RNA [7] .",

During programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF), the tRNAs positioned on the slippery site uncouple from the mRNA and reconnect in the new reading frame. The second stem of the stimulatory pseudoknot is formed by the distal 3' sequence base-pairing with residues in the loop region of the first stem loop. Unlike other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots the SARS pseudoknot contains an additional internal stem loop [8] [9] [10] . The function of this structure, called stem 3, is unknown. We have shown that alterations to the SARS coronavirus frameshift signal affect frameshifting efficiency [9, 11] . Reduction in frameshifting efficiency is expected to result in decreased expression of the frameshift proteins, including the RdRP. Some mutations that reduced frameshifting were associated with a several-fold reduction in the amount of genomic RNA [7] . Unfortunately, the mutations employed in prior studies altered both the nucleic acid and protein sequences making it impossible to separate the contributions of RNA",

            "text": "In an effort to further our understanding of how the SARS frameshift signal functions we performed deletion and mutagenesis studies an analyzed the effects on frameshifting efficiency, RNA structure and viral RNA production. There are at least three different types of structures used by the coronaviruses to stimulate frameshifting. Some coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, use a three stemmed pseudoknot, others such as human coronavirus 229E have an 'elaborated pseudoknot' or kissing stem-loops, while the avian infectious bronchitis virus utilizes a two stemmed pseudoknot [9, 12, 13] . That these diverse coronaviruses retain some sequence between stems 1 and 2 yet have quite different frameshift stimulating structures is intriguing. One inference that can be made is that the RNA sequence, or a structure formed by it, is involved in some other aspect of the virus lifecycle. Our initial hypothesis was that a regulatory element was contained within this sequence. Here we describe deletion and mutagenesis experiments with a dual luciferase reporter to show that the effect the sequence between stems 1 and 2 has on frameshifting efficiency is due to structural changes those mutations cause in the pseudoknot. Further, we show by making synonomous mutations in the virus that different levels of frameshifting efficiency affect the production of genomic and subgenomic RNA differently. This could be caused by disruption of a regulatory element or the altered ratio of proteins derived from the coding region flanking the frameshift signal.",

Beginning with the wild-type stem 3 containing nine paired bases and a nine residue loop, the following series of mutants were constructed. First, the loop capping stem 3 was replaced with a shorter tetraloop; the L2Tetra construct contains ten paired bases and a four residue loop. This was used as the basis for construction of two additional tetraloop constructs with progressively shorter stem 3 structures: L2Tetra/S3-4bp, containing only four paired bases in the stem, and L2Tetra/S3-2bp, which has only two paired bases. The 5'-uucg-3' tetraloop sequence used in the L2Tetra/S3-4bp mutant was selected because the last base-pair before the tetraloop affects its formation. The closing pair for UNCG tetraloops is usually C-G compared to the G-C closing base-pair found in CUUG tetraloops. All of the truncated structures promoted frameshifting at levels equal to or greater than the wild-type pseudoknot structure using a dual luciferase reporter assay ( Figure 1) . Interestingly, the L2Tetra/S3-4bp mutant stimulated frameshifting at 25.1% compared to the 15 to 17.5% observed for the other stem 3 mutants. It is possible that the difference in the tetraloop contributed to the slight increase in frameshifting efficiency.

Site directed mutagenesis was used to replace the wild-type loop 2 with a CUUG tetraloop (L2Tetra).

            "text": "the sequence of Stem 3 itself, have similarly strong roles [9, 11] . However, given the ability of tetraloop-capped stem 3 mutants to promote high levels of frameshifting, we asked if these mutations could compensate for deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2. To this end, the bulged adenosines in stems 2 and 3 were deleted both individually and together in the context of the L2Tetra construct ( Figure 2 ). L2Tetra was chosen as the baseline because, among the tetraloop mutants, it most closely represents the wild-type sequence. Deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2 (L2TetraS2\u0394) reduced frameshifting by 84.2% (17.5% versus 2.77%, p = 9.3 \u00d7 10 \u221219 , Figure 2 ). When the bulged adenosine from stem 3 was removed (L2TetraS3\u0394) a similar reduction of 82.5% was observed (17.5% versus 3.1%, p = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221219 ). Interestingly, removal of both adenosines (L2TetraS2\u0394S3\u0394) partially restored frameshifting with only a 28.2% reduction in frameshifting (17.5% versus 12.6%, p = 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). Bulged adenosines, which are known to bend helices [14] , may be participating in formation of a functional pseudoknot structure. Indeed, many frameshift-stimulating structures have bent conformations that are postulated to help effect frameshifting [15] [16] [17] . Importantly, however, the contribution of the bulges in the SARS pseudoknot is not the same in the context of the native stem 3/loop 2. Specifically, removing both bulged adenosines (S2\u0394S3\u0394) from the wild-type backbone decreased rates of frameshifting by 93% (15.3 versus 1.06%, p = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u221218 ), similar to that observed with the removal of the stem 2 bulge alone ( Figure 2 ). Together these results suggest that stabilization of stem 3 assists in the formation or stability of stem 2, which in turn is essential for frameshifting. However, the actual sequence of loop 2 or the tetraloop-capping stem 3 also affected frameshifting efficiency, either through the stabilization of stem 3 or the formation of stem 2 itself, thus implicating the nucleotides in loop 2 or the tetraloop in tertiary structure interactions. Further evidence comes from the chemical protection data (below), demonstrating that the altered sequence of loop 2 affects the structure of stems 2 and 3. Although secondary structure predictions indicate that the nucleotides in loop 2 are not part of a helix, those nucleotides are susceptible to both single-and double-strand-specific nucleases [9] suggesting that these nucleotides participate, at least part of the time, in some ordered structural state.",

To determine the biological significance of stem 3, we tested a virus containing synonymous stem 3 mutations and a virus containing synonymous loop 2 mutations ( Figure 4A ). RNA was extracted from the infected cell lysate, amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were present. The S3D virus was viable but replicates to a lower titer than the wild type ( Figure 4B ; Table 1 ). The effect on production of genomic and subgenomic RNA was quantified by RT-PCR ( Figure 4C ). Although the S3D virus could be detected by RT-PCR, the TCID 50 values were below the limit of the assay (Table 1 ; Figure 4B ). The L2-UCC mutant was detected by both methods.",

In contrast, genomic RNA from the S3D mutant only accumulated to levels approximately three orders of magnitude lower. Interestingly, the genomic to subgenomic RNA ratios were inverted for the S3D mutant: while the wild type and L2-UCC viruses had tenfold more genomic than subgenomic RNA, the S3D mutant had tenfold more subgenomic RNA than genomic RNA ( Figure 4C ). Similar changes in viral RNA ratios were seen with viruses with mutated slippery sites, implicating a broader region of this part of the genome as being involved in regulation of transcription [7] . While the changes in the previous report resulted in an altered protein sequence, it is unknown if the pseudoknot structure in the slippery site mutants was affected. The viruses used in this study all encode identical proteins indicating that protein function itself is not causing the altered transcription patterns. This suggests that the differences between the viruses are due to RNA sequence and/or structural changes.",

The reduction in virion-associated gRNA levels could occur if a packaging signal was disrupted. Disruption of a packaging signal would result in fewer complete virions and lower TCID 50 and gRNA values as observed for the S3D mutant. Although the efficiency of frameshifting is similar for the L2-UCC and S3D mutants the gRNA levels differ by several log. The stabilization of L2-UCC stem 3 structure and loss of S3D stem 3 structure (see Figure 3 ) also support the idea that this region may contain a packaging signal. Asterisks indicate values that were at the lower limit of the assay. (C) Relative abundance of genomic and subgenomic RNA in viral stocks. Plaque purified virus was used to infect Vero cells.

RNA Structure Probing. The structures of the pseudoknots were probed using the selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) procedure of Wilkinson et al. [22] . SHAPE analysis utilizes N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), which tests the local backbone flexibility of RNA. More flexible nucleotides assume conformations that are reactive to NMIA which irreversibly acylates the ribose 2'-hydroxyl groups. This then presents as a stop upstream of the modified base during primer extension. Thus, a more intense band in the primer extension autoradiograph represents a more flexible region of the RNA.

Our work demonstrated that a less structured stem 3 in the frameshift pseudoknot led to significantly reduced amounts of gRNA when compared to viruses with more structured pseudoknots. However, the same change in viral RNA patterns was observed with a slippery site mutant suggesting that if a packaging signal is present it extends from, or is affected by, the upstream slippery site.",

            "text": "The correlation between stem 3 structure and gRNA levels indicates that a structural requirement in stem 3 is required for optimal RNA production but we cannot, at this stage rule out a frameshifting threshold similar to that observed for the yeast double-stranded RNA virus M1 [31] . That is, if frameshifting drops below a certain frequency, the change in the ratio of pp1a to pp1ab results in a dramatic reduction in gRNA production. Indeed, recent reports describing the function of a nonstructural protein (nsp8) encoded upstream of the frameshift signal provide an alternative hypothesis to regulatory element hypothesis investigated in this work. Nsp8 was initially described as a non-canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and produced as part of the pp1a protein whether or not frameshifting occurs [32] . In contrast, the canonical RdRP Nsp12 is produced as part of the pp1ab protein only if frameshifting occurs. This, in conjunction with our data suggests that the nsp8 polymerse might direct sgRNA production and that the RdRP encoded in nsp12 is predominantly used for gRNA production. It has been hypothesized that coronavirus RNA synthesis involves structurally and functionally separable RNA synthesising complexes [33] . The nsp7+nsp8 complex from three different coronaviruses have recently been shown to have primer-independent RNA polymerase activity [33, 34] in contrast to the nsp12 RdRP which is primer dependent [35] . Currently the details regarding coronavirus RNA synthesis are very limited and do not explain how the polymerases distinguish between templates or prime synthesis. te Velthuis and colleagues suggested that the separate RdRPs may influence plus and minus strand synthesis [33] but our results indicate that the division might be between genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. The RT-PCR for detection of gRNA and sgRNA in our study generated a cDNA intermediate using random hexamers and because of this the analyses performed here do not distinguish between the production of positive-and negative-strands nor between mRNA and sgRNA. Thus, we do not know if the regulatory sequences or proteins regulating genomic RNA production act upon the positive-or negative-strand replication intermediates or transcription intermediates.",

Similar to previously described viruses containing mutations in the slippery site of the frameshift signal [7] , here we show that mutations to the SARS-CoV frameshift stimulating mRNA pseudoknot can also affect the production of viral genomic RNA. In both instances, the abundance of viral genomic RNA was reduced to 10-fold lower levels than the subgenomic RNA and several orders of magnitude below that of the wild-type virus. It is not clear if this result is due to a change in the abundance of gRNA available to be transcribed to sgRNA or if it is attributable to other factors, such as interactions between the gRNA and other proteins or RNA elements as discussed above. It is also possible that the synonymous changes altered the rate of translation and/or the folding of the RdRP [36] which, in turn, could have affected production of genomic and/or subgenomic RNA. Regardless of the mechanism, our observations provide a backdrop against which new questions about coronvirus replication and transcription may be explored.",
