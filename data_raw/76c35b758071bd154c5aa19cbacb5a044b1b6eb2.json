We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. Conclusions: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.",

All previous outbreaks combined resulted in 2232 reported Ebola cases and 1503 reported deaths [2] . The response effort by local and international health workers and organizations resulted in control of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa by the end of 2015, but not without significant costs for both donor and afflicted countries [3] . By December 2015, the response had cost donors at least US$ 3.6 billion [2] ; an additional estimated US$ 2.2 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2015. More than 17,300 children lost one or both parents to Ebola [2] . Furthermore, access to healthcare services decreased substantially, resulting in a considerable hidden morbidity and mortality burden [4, 5] .",

On March 23 2014, Guinea reported the first cases of the West African Ebola outbreak to the World Health Organization (WHO) [17] . By May 2014, the first Ebola cases were reported in both Liberia and Sierra Leone [2, 15] . In August, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a \"vastly underestimated\" death toll of approximately 1000 persons [6] . Ebola cases also occurred in Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, but were detected and controlled due to efforts from local and international health workers and organizations [3, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Ebola cases were also treated in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and United States. These were mostly healthcare workers who had contracted the disease in West Africa [2] . The risk of Ebola-infected persons traveling to other countries has been highlighted by mathematical models [15, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The biggest risk, however, was in the ability to respond to any additional cases and outbreaks occurring outside the West African foci. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, characterized their response as \"the most intensive outbreak response in the agency's history\" [2] . It is reasonable to question how much additional capacity existed among international health agencies to aid national health agencies with limited resources in a rapid response to yet another Ebola outbreak.",

These cities typically have limited local public health resources and emergency response capabilities. We assumed that some number of Ebola cases would occur in a country before the outbreak is detected and an effective response is initiated, and that responding to the foci in West Africa would have limited the ability of international public health agencies to rapidly aid the responses to additional Ebola outbreaks. Our estimates emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and highlight some of the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems that drove the progression of the Ebola outbreak. Based on these lessons, we produced a list of actionable items that would contribute to a rapid detection and effective responses in countries at high risk for disease transmission, thus minimizing the impact of emergence or re-emergence of infectious disease threats.",

The model, a Markov Chain, tracks patients through the following states: susceptible to disease (S), infected people incubating Ebola virus (I), infectious (I), recovered or dead (R) (i.e., a SIIR model). The model splits the patients who have become symptomatic [30, 31] into three categories of isolation: hospitalization, effective home isolation (including safe burials), and no effective isolation (the main assumptions in the model are discussed in the Additional file 2: Appendix S1).",

We based the seed numbers on two factors. First, observations from West Africa that one or two initial cases can result, due to local customs related treatment of sick persons and burial ceremonies, in several additional cases. As an example of an extreme situation, a single undiagnosed (missed) Ebola case and unsafe burial in Kono, Sierra Leone, resulted in 43 confirmed cases [33] . Further, the degree of underreporting in West Africa was estimated to be between approximately 1.5 to 3.0 Ebola cases for each reported case [34, 35] . Thus, even with 2 identified cases there are likely to be many more initially unidentified cases that represent a risk of onward transmission.",

These include, for example, the quality of the disease surveillance system, availability of trained healthcare workers, laboratory and diagnostic capabilities, health infrastructure, accessibility to infected patients, patients' health-seeking behaviour, available resources, competing government priorities [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . We used three rate-ofgrowth scenarios to model how quickly an outbreak is contained; these scenarios were based on transmissionand-containment patterns observed in Liberia during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic [2] (Additional file 2: Appendix S2). For all three scenarios, we assumed that within the first week of outbreak detection 10% of Ebola cases would be hospitalized or effectively isolated [2, 10] (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Figure S2 ). We based the \"Liberia-like scenario\" on data collected in Liberia during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic (3). We assumed a 5-6% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through 11, and a 2% increase per week during weeks 12 through 16. This resulted in 66% of cases being effectively isolated by week 15 (3) . It is important to note that the Ebola outbreak response effort in Liberia included substantial support from international health workers and organizations, in addition to local response capabilities [2, 3, 16] . We built the \"delayed-response\" (slower than Liberia) scenario by assuming a 1.5% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through three, and 2-4% increase in hospitalization or effective isolation during weeks four through 16. For our \"fast-response\" scenario, we assumed a 10% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through four, a 7% increase per week during weeks five through seven, and a 4% increase per week in weeks eight through 12. In this \"fast response\" scenario, the final proportion of cases in effective isolation leveled off at 81% at week 13 (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Figure S2 ). We used data from Liberia because in August-September 2014, Liberia experienced rapid growth in cases (doubling of cases approximately every 23 days) [41] , clearly illustrating some of the challenges faced by countries with limited public health infrastructure and existing capacity for rapid response. Model parameters can be adjusted by the user; the spreadsheet-based model is available for free at http:// stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900.",

That is, we assumed that higher-income countries would be able to mobilize resources more quickly than Liberia, and lower-income countries would respond more slowly (i.e., we used a three-tiered approach: delayed response, Liberia-like response, and fast response). Higher income countries tend to have a more robust public health infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic capabilities, and larger trained workforce per capita than lower income countries, which would presumably allow them to implement effective outbreak control measures faster [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . We also assumed that the spread of Ebola was similar among different cities in the same economic category, as they were likely to have comparable health expenditures and infrastructure.",

For example, in an analysis of data from Montserrado County, Liberia, cases in areas with lower socio-economic status (SES) were responsible for higher numbers of reported contacts, secondary cases and wider spread to other parts of the county [51] . To account for these differences in living conditions between Monrovia, Liberia, and the cities used in the analyses, we performed two additional sets of analyses. We weighted the estimated number of Ebola cases that would occur using the ratio of: 1) each city's population density (pop/ sq. mile) to Monrovia's population density (more densely populated cities would have on average more Ebola transmission), and 2) the ratio of the proportion of the population living in slums (shanty towns) at the country level to the proportion of the population living in slums in Liberia.",

            "text": "Last, we selected five countries for modeling the potential of spread of Ebola within a country once a case had been imported into the main city: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa and India. These countries were selected as an illustration, based on total population, air travel, population in slums, and with different levels of income. Within each country, we selected major urban centers based on population size (100,000 people or more) and travel access to the country's major urban area through air travel or location along a major highway. We projected the number of cases in each city, using the same intervention scenarios as before: delayed response for lower income countries, Liberia-like response for lower-middle income countries, and fast response for upper-middle income countries. Despite Liberia being a low-income country, the response to the Ebola outbreak received substantial external support [52] . To account for differences in living conditions, we weighted the estimated number of Ebola cases that could have occurred adjusting by the city's population density (pop/sq. mile) compared to Monrovia. Figure 1 shows the potential number of Ebola cases in each country's major city, assuming a single case was imported from one of the three Ebola-affected countries, and new ongoing transmission was established. The data mapped in Fig. 1 represent: (i) a delayed-response scenario for low-income countries (Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso, Mali, Togo); (ii) a Liberialike response scenario for lower middle-income countries (Kenya, Mauritania, Senegal, India, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco); and (iii) a fast response scenario for upper-middle income countries (Turkey, China, South Africa, and Lebanon), adjusted by the city's population density compared to Monrovia. In each country, the black bars represent the estimated number of cases if effective control measures (including having patients receive specialized care in hospitals, effectively isolating people at risk at home or in their communities, safe burial practices, contact tracing and monitoring), were initiated after 10 cases had occurred while the red bars represent what might have happened if the initiation of effective control measures did not occur before there were 100 Ebola cases within the city. For comparison, on March 2014, the WHO announced an Ebola outbreak notified by the Ministry of Health of Guinea, and Liberia reported the first Ebola cases about a week later. At the end of May, presumably knowing that Ebola was a major threat from neighboring Guinea and Liberia, Sierra Leone reported the first Ebola cases, from participants in a local funeral. Five weeks later, by July 11, there were more than 300 confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone [2] . Further details showing the unadjusted number of Ebola cases, estimated cases weighted by population density, and estimated cases weighted by population living in slums, compared to Liberia are show in the Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S6 . The main conclusions from the analysis did not change based on the use of weights. Figure 2 shows estimates for the potential number of Ebola cases per city, had Ebola transmission spread from the initial city affected to other major cities within the selected countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa and India), weighted by population density. Considering the model assumptions, early detection of cases and rapid initiation of control measures would be particularly important in the major cities of low-income countries (Ethiopia). The specific estimates of potential Ebola cases per city and the estimates with no adjustments are shown in the Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S7 . Our estimates assume that international and/ or national preparedness and response efforts were not already substantially underway; i.e., that some number of Ebola cases would occur in a country before the outbreak was detected and an effective response initiated.",

The potential spread of Ebola varied greatly, largely hinging on the number of cases that occurred before detection and initiation of an effective response, and on the effectiveness of the response. Preparing for the next crisis entails examining the factors that allowed halting the outbreak in the countries where importations occurred, and analysing the main challenges in the three West African countries where Ebola spread.",

            "text": "A useful illustration of how local health systems can quickly detect and effectively respond to a rapidly evolving outbreak was the control of Ebola in Nigeria in July 2014 [3, 15, 18] . A cluster of 19 Ebola cases originated from a single traveler with Ebola who flew on a commercial airplane from Liberia to Lagos. One Ebola-infected nurse who cared for the index case apparently travelled to Enugu, over 500 km from Lagos, and one primary contact of the index case with Ebola travelled to Port Hartcourt, over 600 km from Lagos [15] . Both cases underscored the risk of rapid intra-country spread of Ebola. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with CDC and other partners, rapidly created an incident management system largely using staff from the Nigerian Polio Eradication Program and support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An Emergency Operation Center (EOC) had been recently established in Nigeria to support the polio eradication initiatives, which had prioritized health system strengthening and emergency response preparedness. The polio EOC deputy became the Ebola EOC incident manager, and had readily access to trained staff and financial resources within the health system and from partner agencies including WHO, CDC, and Doctors Without Borders [18] . The response team identified 898 contacts who were followed-up due to potential exposure to Ebola virus; patients with suspected infection were effectively isolated in Ebola treatment facilities [15, 18] . Contact tracing efforts were supervised by experienced epidemiologists and supported by in-country laboratory testing (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and anti-Ebola virus immunoglobulin G diagnostic tests). This rapid initiation of control measures (which included training of healthcare workers, contact tracing, household visits, effective isolation of infectious patients, airport screening, and the creation of an Emergency Treatment Unit in two weeks) was critical to halt Ebola virus transmission, and probably prevent thousands of additional Ebola Notes: Scenarios showing potential number of cases in each city assume either 10 or 100 cases before detection and initiation of an effective response. Further, in each city, the speed at which an Ebola outbreak was assumed to be brought under control was modeled using one of three control scenarios. These scenarios were either faster, equal or slower than the speed of the control of the Liberian Ebola epidemic, and the estimates adjusted for population density. Cities were allocated to each control scenario based on their country's World Bank economic classification (see Additional file 2 for further details). The complete results of the estimated number of cases in each country for all control scenarios can found in the Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S6 [32] cases [15] . Our model (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S3 ) suggests that we would have expected 367 cases of Ebola, if only 10 cases of Ebola had occurred in Nigeria before detection and initiation of an effective response, based on a \"Liberia-like\" Ebola transmission and response. However, partly due to the enhanced response capabilities from the Nigerian Polio Eradication Program, only one Ebola case occurred before detection and effective response, and Nigeria had a fast response due to availability of resources and trained health workforce. Using these values, to describe a unique scenario, our model predicted 14 Ebola cases (36 using population weights), which is close with what occurred in Nigeria (19 cases of Ebola after a quick and effective response). Our estimates are also comparable to the results from a model based on the days before the intervention, assuming 12 exposed individuals from an index case [15] .",

Our illustrative estimates are subject to at least three limitations. First, extrapolating disease transmission in Liberia to other countries with very different public health systems may not be appropriate, as other factors such as public awareness and attitudes, or Fig. 2 Ebola cases per city in case of intra-country transmission (selected countries). Note: Scenarios showing potential number of cases in each city assume either 10 or 100 cases before detection and initiation of an effective response. In each city, the speed at which an Ebola outbreak was assumed to be brought under control was modeled using one of three control scenarios. These scenarios were either faster, equal or slower than the speed of the control of the Liberian Ebola epidemic, and the estimates adjusted for population density. Cities were allocated to each control scenario based on their country' s World Bank economic classification (see text and Supplemental material for further details). The specific numbers in this figure are shown in Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S7 spontaneous behavioral changes could alter epidemic growth patterns. Second, we relied on constant epidemiological parameters (e.g., incubation period) for the Ebola outbreak across cities and countries. Third, we used three epidemic growth scenarios and assumed they depended on a country's GNI, based on an association between GNI per capita and health expenditures [42] [43] [44] , which may not be reflective of the outbreak detection and response capabilities of some countries. There is substantial uncertainty in our estimates; we have no data to accurately predict the capacity of countries that were at high risk of Ebola transmission, as determined by air travel volume, of detecting and initiating an effective response to prevent or slow down an Ebola outbreak, and there is no counterfactual to contrast our results. However, even though we cannot know whether the estimated cases of Ebola that might have occurred had Ebola spread beyond Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia are accurate estimates, the results underscore the global risk posed by the Ebola crisis and potentially by other infectious disease threats [15, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] .

Infectious diseases can spread rapidly, as shown by the Ebola epidemic, H1N1 influenza [56, 57] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [58] , and, more recently, by the regional spread of the Zika virus [59] .",

The outbreak proved that global health security needs to be a priority, and confirmed, once again, that increased mobility, air travel, and international trade have increased our connections as a global community and that we share the health risks of emerging and re-emerging pathogens and other public health threats [52] . The great paradox is that while the world may now be better prepared than ever in history to respond to emerging threats, we are at a higher risk of pandemics from increasing interconnectivity [3] . Health security has to be founded on robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak. When local capacity is insufficient, an effective global health response has to be quick and decisive, with all parties working cooperatively and in a coordinate fashion [64] . While the Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in many ways, the lack of a coherent, organized, and timely response, highlighted critical questions that need an urgent response. ",
