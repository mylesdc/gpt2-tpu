            "text": "Background: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients worldwide and imposes an intense pressure on health care facilities. Data on the epidemiology profiles of ARIs are scarce in the western and rural areas of China. The purpose of the current study is to provide data on the presence of potential pathogens of ARIs in hospitalized children in Chengdu, west China. Methods: Respiratory specimens were obtained from hospitalized patients (under 6 years old) with ARIs in a local hospital in Chengdu. Eight respiratory viruses were identified by PCR and 6 respiratory bacteria by biochemical reactions and Analytical Profile Index (API). Pathogens profiles, clinical characteristics and seasonality were analyzed. Results: Fifty-one percent of patients were identified with at least one respiratory pathogen. Human rhinovirus (HRV) (23%), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.7%) was the most commonly identified viruses, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%) the most commonly identified bacterium in the study. The presences of more than one pathogen were found, and multiple viral, bacterial, viral/bacterial combinations were identified in 14.9, 3.3 and 13.9% of patients respectively. Respiratory viruses were identified throughout the year with a seasonal peak in December-February. Pathogens profiles and clinical associations were different between infants (< 1 year of age) and older children (> 1 year of age). Infants with ARIs were more likely to have one or more viruses than older children. Infants identified with multiple pathogens had significantly higher proportions of tachypnea than infants that were not. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that viral agents were frequently found in hospitalized children with ARI in Chengdu during the study period. This study gives us better information on the pathogen profiles, clinical associations, co-infection combinations and seasonal features of ARIs in hospitalized children, which is important for diagnoses and treatment of ARIs, as well as implementation of vaccines in this area. Moreover, future efforts in reducing the impact of ARIs will depend on programs in which available vaccines, especially vaccines on RSV, HRV and S. pneumoniae could be employed in this region and new vaccines could be developed against common pathogens.",

There were approximate 11.9 million episodes of severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide [2] , and ARIs-related pneumonia was one of the leading cause of death that due to infectious disease in China (> 30,000 deaths annually) as well as globally (935,000 in 2013) [3, 4] . There were, as have been suggested, associations of several viral agents with ARIs, such as: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV) and human bocavirus (BoV), accounting for about 35-87% of children with ARI [5] . Viral co-infections occurred in 4-33% of children hospitalized with ARIs, and may indicate an increasing risk for clinical outcome [6, 7] . Further, bacterial infections such as: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, et al., were commonly observed in the later stage of diseases due to immune-compromised viral infections [8] .",

The composition of ARIs is geographically diverse and is largely associated with the epidemic status of each ARIs and climate conditions [9, 10] . The prevalence of ARIs varies from 14.6 to 94.3% among hospitalized children with respiratory infections in some metropolitan cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in China [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, in the underdeveloped interior areas of China, epidemiology profiles of ARIs are seldom reported. Chengdu is a mega-city in the southwest of China and has a population of more than 15 million people. Flu vaccination rates were pretty low in this area, which were 2.18, 1.69, 1.82 and 1.63% respectively from 2010 to 2013 [15] . The purpose of the current study is to investigate the profiles of respiratory pathogens and epidemiology characteristics of ARIs in hospitalized children in Chengdu.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates, sputum, blood and bronchoalevlar lavage fluid were used for bacterial analyses. For isolation of bacteria, specimens were cultured on sheep blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey's agar plates. Isolated bacteria were primarily evaluated by colonial morphology, Gram staining, and were finally identified by biochemical reactions and API system. S. pneumoniae were differentiated by Optochin sensitivity and Group A streptococcus were identified by bacitracin sensitivity. P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae were identified by API 20E.

RSV is a major respiratory virus that causes respiratory illness including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and wheezing [23] . RSV may bring about annual epidemics worldwide because of virus variability [24] . It is reported that RSV epidemic was associated with the alternate circulation of multiple genotypes and with the change of G protein [25] . HRV are usually associated with upper respiratory tract infections and are responsible for one half of all \"common colds\" [26] .

The impact of co-infection on clinical presentations may rely on the specific agent involved, as well as viral load [32, 33] . Experimental studies of simultaneous respiratory infections are scarce. However, one study showed by mathematical modeling, found that one virus can block replication of another due to competition for resources, which may have implications for the treatment regimens of simultaneous viral infections [34] .

Pneumonia is the most serious result of ARIs and is often due to bacterial infection [37] . S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b are the leading causes of bacterial pneumonia in children worldwide [38, 39] .

Including 14 different respiratory pathogens (both viruses and bacteria), recruiting almost 2000 hospitalized children, over 5-year period, this current study revealed pathogens profiles, co-infection pattern, clinical features, and seasonality among hospitalized children with ARIs in Chengdu, west China. There are however some limitations in this study. Outpatients were not recruited and the study lacked an asymptomatic control group. Positive rates may be somewhat lower as other potential viral pathogens were not included (e.g. enteroviruses, HCoV NL63 and HKU1). In addition, virus genotyping and strain identification (such as HRV A/B/C) would be helpful for understanding viral epidemics and associated disease severity.",

Co-infections were associated with severity of illness in infants, who tended to have increased risks of ARIs. This study gives us better information on the pathogen profiles, clinical association, co-infection combinations, and seasonal features of ARIs in hospitalized children in this area. Moreover, future efforts in reducing the impact of ARIs will depend on a commitment to fund and implement programs to utilize available vaccines, especially vaccines on RSV, HRV and S. pneumoniae in in this region, and to develop new vaccines against common pathogens.
