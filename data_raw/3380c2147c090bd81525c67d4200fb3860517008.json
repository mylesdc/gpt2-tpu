Various factors including heredity, environmental agent, innate and acquired immunity, and skin barrier function participate in the pathogenesis of AD. Thelper (Th) 2-dominant immunological milieu has been suggested in the acute phase of AD. Antigen 85B (Ag85B) is a 30-kDa secretory protein well conserved in Mycobacterium species. Ag85B has strong Th1-type cytokine inducing activity, and is expected to ameliorate Th2 condition in allergic disease. To perform Ag85B function in vivo, effective and less invasive vaccination method is required. Recently, we have established a novel functional virus vector; recombinant human parainfluenza type 2 virus vector (rhPIV2): highly expressive, replication-deficient, and very low-pathogenic vector. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of rhPIV2 engineered to express Ag85B (rhPIV2/Ag85B) in a mouse AD model induced by repeated oxazolone (OX) challenge. Ear swelling, dermal cell infiltrations and serum IgE level were significantly suppressed in the rhPIV2/Ag85B treated mouse group accompanied with elevated IFN-c and IL-10 mRNA expressions, and suppressed IL-4, TNF-a and MIP-2 mRNA expressions. The treated mice showed no clinical symptom of croup or systemic adverse reactions. The respiratory tract epithelium captured rhPIV2 effectively without remarkable cytotoxic effects. These results suggested that rhPIV2/Ag85B might be a potent therapeutic tool to control allergic disorders.",

Heredity, environmental agent, immunity, and skin barrier function participate in the pathogenesis of AD. AD symptoms are triggered by various non-specific or specific allergic reactions. The cytokine pattern of AD, especially in the acute phase skin lesion is Th2-type cytokine dominant [1] . The barrier disrupted skin in AD is easily permitted the percutaneous entry of environmental allergens that strongly promotes Th2 immunological responses [2] . Th2 cells as well as T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets play key roles in development of AD. Patients with AD have significantly increased numbers of peripheral blood Treg compared with healthy controls, which is correlated with disease activity in AD [3, 4] . This suggests involvement of some self regulation system in immune responses in AD [5] .",

The genome of hPIV2 encodes 7 mRNAs [12] [13] [14] and has about 60-nt leader sequence at 39 end and about 20-nt noncoding trailer sequence. The gene order is 39 (leader)-NP-V/P-M-F-HN-L-(trailer)-59. The coding proteins are the nucleocapsid (NP), the V (V) and phospho (P), the matrix (M), the fusion (F), the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and the polymerase protein (L). The genomic RNA of the virus: viral RNA (vRNA) is encapsidated with the NP proteins, and the nucleocapsids are associated with the P and L proteins to form the Figure 1 . Schematic diagram of constructs and strategy used in this study. A. The constructs of recombinant hPIV2/EGFP and hPIV2/Ag85B. The EGFP or Ag85B gene open reading frame was engineered to be flanked by hPIV2-specific gene end of NP gene (R2), intergenic sequence (IG), and gene start (R1) transcriptional signal of V/P gene. It was inserted into a cloned cDNA of the hPIV2 antigenome at a Not I site that had been engineered to be at 59-noncoding region of NP gene. A genomic nucleotide length divisible by six (the rule of six) was maintained. For generating of replicationdeficient virus, two stop codons (.) were introduced on the M gene. B. Schedule for the development of a hapten-induced atopic dermatitis model and vaccination of rhPIV2/Ag85B. Mice were initially sensitized with 20 ml of 0.5% OX solution to their right ear 7 days prior to the first challenge (day -7) and then 20 ml of 0.5% OX solution was repeatedly applied on the right ear 3 times per week from day 0 until day 21. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 20 ml (5610 6 TCID 50 ) of rhPIV2/Ag85B or rhPIV2 on day 4. rhPIV2 vector or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were also applied as controls.

In paramyxovirus particles, vRNA is enclosed by the viral envelope composed of a cellular lipid bilayer and two envelope glycoproteins, HN and F, which are integral transmembrane proteins mediating virus attachment and cell fusion, respectively [15] . M protein underlies the lipid bilayer to ensure the structural integrity of the viral particles and is essential for interactions between the viral envelope and the RNP complex [15] . This association leads to the budding and release of viral particles from the cell surface [15] .",

The cells were harvested, and then co-cultured with fresh Vero cells every 48 hr. Approximately 90% of the cells showed syncytia formation in the 10 th cocultured cells, and its state was maintained in further co-culture. Furthermore, for virus propagation, Cos7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing M and co-cultured with abovementioned 10 th cells.

AD, especially in its acute phase, is a disease that Th2 cells are dominantly involved in the pathogenesis. In fact PBMCs from patients with AD have increased production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 with limited capacity in production of IFN-c [23] [24] [25] . Repeated elicitation of OX on mice ear shifts the cutaneous Th1 cytokine milieu to Th2, which represents the characteristic immunological features of AD. Immunotherapy for AD has some different options to correct the imbalance of the shifted cytokine profile. In the present study, we investigated effects of vaccination using replication-deficient rhPIV2 vector expressing Ag85B gene to mouse AD model. BCG is known as a strong Th1 response modifier; however, it has a risk for granuloma formation. To avoid granuloma formation, non-wax protein antigen is required. Ag85B is a conserved protein in mycobacterial species and can elicit a strong Th1-type immune Expressions of IL-4, TNF-a and MIP2-a mRNA were significantly decreased in the ear skin treated with intranasally rhPIV2/Ag85B treated group compared to those of control groups.

            "text": "Selection of the vector and its application pathway has importance in successful DNA vaccination therapy. We selected hPIV2 as a potential vector for Ag85B vaccination. hPIVs are human respiratory pathogens, and the most distinctive clinical feature of infection of hPIVs is croup (i.e., laryngotracheobronchitis or swelling around the vocal chords and other parts of the upper and middle airway). Among hPIVs, hPIV1 and hPIV3 are the major cause of croup in children, whereas hPIV2 is rarely identified as a clinical pathogen. Therefore, hPIV2 has been suspected as less virulent and cytotoxic virus. hPIV2 enters the cell by cell fusion at the plasma membrane, and replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, and buds at the plasma membrane. Therefore, hPIV2 has no risk for integration in the host genome, not like retrovirus. In addition, since hPIV2 has a non-segmented and negative-stranded RNA genome, there is no antigenic shift among RNA segments, not like influenza viruses. Using technology of advanced reverse genetics [20] , we constituted replicationdeficient hPIV2 vector with additional advantage as a highly safe virus vector. To confirm the target and effective infection of rhPIV2 vector, we inoculated rhPIV2/EGFP to HaCat cells. HaCat cells successfully expressed EGFP up to 7 days postinfection (pi). Also, BALB/c mice intranasally single-administrated with rhPIV2/EGFP showed intense EGFP expression in the airway epithelial cells. These results strongly support activities of long-term high-level expression of the exogenous gene and efficiency of rhPIV2 in vivo.",

Inflammatory cell infiltration including mast cells and eosinophils in the lesional skin was also suppressed. In the cytokine profile, mRNA expression of IFN-c and IL-2 in the ear skins was significantly increased. Interestingly, IL-4 mRNA was significantly reduced in intranasal rhPIV2/Ag85B treated groups. In IL-4 suppression and IFN-c induction, intra-nasal application showed stronger effects compared with subcutaneous application. hPIV2 is a virus infectious to the respiratory tract mucosa, and therefore more effective capture of rhPIV2/Ag85B by respiratory epithelium compared with that of skin resident cells is reasonable. In addition, the skin derived anti-infectious molecule, horny layer proteases and epithelial skin barrier might decrease efficiency of rhPIV2.",

TGF-b and IL-10 have been described as critical regulatory cytokines produced by Treg. In fact in the current experiment, the numbers of skin infiltrating CD4 + T cells are decreased in the nasal application and ear skin application groups accompanied with increased FoxP3 + Treg population. A heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (M. vaccae) gives rise to allergen specific regulatory T cells that produce IL-10 and TGF-b, which confer the protection against airway inflammation [27] . Recently TGF-b was proved to suppress GATA-3 function through Sox4 signal, and TGF-b controls Th2 cellmediated inflammation [28] . In addition, it is crucial that PIV2 itself has some effects in induction of Treg without obvious effects in clinical manifestation and Th1/Th2 balance.",

Thus, nasal rhPIV2/Ag85B vaccination is a novel, less invasive and useful therapeutic approach for AD and related allergic disorder.",

B. Ear thickness measured before and 6 hours after each OX application on day 21. The ear swelling was suppressed significantly in rhPIV2/ Ag85B treated groups in two ways compared to those in the placebo treated groups. (*P,0.05, **P,0.01.) C.

The placebo treated groups (PBS, PIV2 ear and PIV2 nasal investigated efficiency of rhPIV2 vaccine vector expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene (rhPIV2/ EGFP) in infection and expression in vitro and in vivo.
