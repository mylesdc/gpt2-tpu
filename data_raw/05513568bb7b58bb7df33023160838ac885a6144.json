            "text": "During an ongoing outbreak, understanding the epidemiological dynamics and predicting the likely course of the outbreak are time-critical tasks essential for informing intervention [1, 2] . If systematic monitoring is in place, key parameters such as R 0 , the basic reproductive number [1] , can be estimated directly, as in the case of the foot and mouth disease outbreak among British cattle in 2001 [3] and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia in 2002 and 2003 [4] . Genetic analysis provides a window into the epidemic history of a pathogen that can complement epidemiological analysis, as in the case of the H1N1 influenza A pandemic in 2009 [5, 6] , or take its place in the absence of reliable surveillance data. The ability to sequence pathogen genomes in real time, for example during the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti [7] , foretells of the increasingly important role for genetic analysis during outbreak response.",

            "text": "Genetic analysis is a well-established tool for revealing the epidemic history of pathogen populations [8, 9] . It commonly involves the post hoc interpretation of an evolutionary tree constructed from genetic sequences. Relationships between isolates may reveal the order of transmission events [10, 11] , whereas the shape of the tree is informative about overarching dynamics [12] . However, more powerful approaches explicitly integrate genetic and epidemiological models. For example, coalescent methods-which can be used to infer historical changes in population size [13] [14] [15] -have been applied to pathogen populations to infer historical changes in prevalence. By modelling changes in prevalence using the susceptible-infectious -susceptible (SIS) model, epidemiological parameters such as the intrinsic growth rate of the epidemic have been estimated directly [16] . Early applications of the coalescent approach shed new light on the epidemic behaviour of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [16] , and the pathogen has continued to attract intense research attention owing to its medical importance and amenability to genetic analysis. HCV is a major cause of liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Estimated to infect 160 million people around the world [17] , it is implicated in 350 000 deaths per year [18] . Sharing contaminated needles and transfusion of infected blood products are thought to be the main routes of transmission [19] . HCV is an enormously diverse RNA virus, comprising six major types with varying geographical distributions [20, 21] . Coalescent inference has been used to date the origin of HCV in different countries [16, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , providing a historical context for the emergence of epidemics and providing quantitative support for the roles of iatrogenic transmission [22] and drug use [29] . The advent of population-level whole genome sequencing has revealed previously unfathomed diversity in pathogenic bacteria [30] , leading to wider interest in integrated approaches to genetics and epidemiology beyond rapidly evolving viruses such as HCV. However, theoretical work has shown that although the central assumption of coalescent approachesthat effective population size is proportional to prevalence-is valid at dynamic equilibrium [31] , it does not hold more generally [32, 33] . In this study, we derive a new framework for population genetic inference of epidemiological dynamics based on a metapopulation model of pathogen populations. Using coalescent results for metapopulations [34, 35] , we expose the assumptions implicit to coalescent approaches and explore the limits of genetic inference. We implement SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST [36] , and conduct a meta-analysis investigating the epidemiological processes that underlie differences in genetic diversity between HCV epidemics.",

However, the growth curves describing changes in N e are simpler than the underlying growth curves that describe changes in prevalence, and have one fewer parameter. Consequently, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the coalescent parameters and the epidemiological parameters, meaning that the epidemiological parameters cannot be fully identified from genetic analysis alone. An independent estimate of one of the epidemiological parameters (e.g. rate of clearance of infection or present-day prevalence) is required to reconstruct historical changes in prevalence. In this respect, our results differ from Pybus et al. [16] , but we agree with their key result that the intrinsic growth rate (r 0 ) in an SIS model can be estimated by modelling changes in N e using a logistic growth curve. We also agree that to estimate the basic reproductive number R 0 , an independent estimate of one of the epidemiological parameters is needed. rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil Trans R Soc B 368: 20120314 (c) Coalescent SIR model Equations for the epidemiological dynamics in the SIR model cannot be solved analytically, but can be solved numerically using computational techniques [47] .

Initially, we identified 28 datasets for which subtype, sampling location, prevalence and NS5B gene sequences were available [22,23,25,29,48 -59] . However, we excluded those with small sample size (fewer than 20 sequences) and evidence of recombination (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). Recombination is problematic for coalescent inference [60] and provides evidence of co-infection, which our method assumes is absent. In total, 18 datasets satisfied our incorporation criteria (see the electronic supplementary material, dataset S1). Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of the HCV datasets and a genealogy based on a global alignment of all sequences, with the subtypes indicated. Subtypes formed distinct monophyletic groups, but the ancestral histories of datasets within the same subtype were shared to varying degrees. We fitted our coalescent SI, SIS and SIR models to each dataset separately while bearing in mind this overlap. For the meta-analysis, we estimated N 0 (the effective population size at the time of sampling) and r 0 (the intrinsic growth rate) using a model-averaging approach that assumed equal prior probability of each scenario (SI, SIS and SIR).",

Diversity varied considerably, ranging from p \u00bc 20.3 to p \u00bc 84.3 per kilobase (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). We found that the strongest predictor of diversity was the age of the most recent common ancestor (T MRCA ), followed by population density and subtype (figure 3). Table 1 shows the regression coefficients and p-values, although the latter must be viewed with a degree of caution owing to pseudo-replication within subtypes. The overall predictive power of the regression was very high (R 2 \u00bc 98.9%). Epidemics with older T MRCA had substantially higher diversity as would be expected, whereas increased population density predicted a reduction in diversity. Of the subtypes represented by multiple datasets, 1b had highest diversity and 6a had lowest diversity after correcting for the effects of T MRCA and population density. Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between diversity and intrinsic growth rate, r 0 , after taking into account other factors. This would be explained by rapid epidemic growth across the datasets, resulting in star-shaped genealogies.",

This value is considerably lower than previous estimates, largely because the duration of the infectious period that we estimated (1.2 -1.6 years) was substantially shorter than the 10-30 years that have previously been supposed [16] . Estimating short infectious periods for hepatitis C is surprising in view of the nature of the disease, which is chronic in 80 per cent of people and has lifelong infectivity [17, 18] .

Dynamical modelling shows that the number of infectious individuals falls when the number of susceptible individuals becomes exhausted. Why this should occur more quickly in these epidemics than the global subtype 1a and 1b outbreaks is unclear, but may depend on mode of transmission, the behaviour of risk groups, local competition between subtypes and virological differences. Our approach has a number of assumptions and limitations, chief among which is the assumption that the number of infected hosts is large. Although this assumption is consistent with the use of deterministic compartmental models, it cannot possibly be true at the beginning of the epidemic. There are a number of promising avenues for incorporating stochasticity into combined genetic and epidemiological models. Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been developed to fit stochastic, nonlinear dynamics to gene genealogies, although currently the genealogy is assumed to be known [62] . Branching processes have been used as an alternative to the coalescent; however, the approach is currently limited to simple birth-death processes [63, 64] . Stochastic demography is readily incorporated into the coalescent [65] , and this will be an area of further investigation.",

Theoretical work shows that variance in network connectivity substantially affects epidemiological dynamics and hence genetic diversity [31, [66] [67] [68] . There is hope that such variability can be handled using a more general formulation of the metapopulation model than was needed here [34] , in which different classes of hosts, such as super shedders, are explicitly modelled. Another of our assumptions, that co-infection is absent, is likely to prove more difficult to overcome. When there is co-infection, recombination can occur. We found evidence of recombination in some HCV datasets, which we excluded from further analysis. Although attempts have been made to incorporate recombination into population genetic inference [69] , these methods are generally computationally prohibitive.",

Changes in the size of the host population are readily incorporated into our model, and this might prove fruitful for inference if independent data are available to disentangle the effects of host and pathogen population dynamics, for instance by coupling an analysis of host and pathogen genetic diversity in BEAST. When there is no more than a single pathogen sequence per host, as we assumed here, longitudinal sampling is straightforward to account for using the standard technique [70] as implemented in BEAST, with no adjustments necessary to the model. When there are multiple pathogen sequences per host, the genealogy of the metapopulation is conceptually divided into the scattering and collecting phases [34] , which correspond informally to within-and between-host evolution, respectively. New apparatus would be required for inference in this situation.",

However, detailed analyses suggest that such heterogeneity does occur in HCV [26, 72] . One of the benefits of implementing our approach in BEAST is that this complexity can be readily incorporated in future analyses. There has been considerable variation in the estimates of the molecular clock rate in HCV [72] . We assumed a clock rate of 0.58 \u00c2 10 23 substitutions per site per year, which was estimated for the NS5B gene [73] , and was previously applied to a number of the datasets we analysed. However, there is evidence to suggest that the rate may be closer to 1.0 \u00c2 10 23 per site per year [26, 72] . The effect of underestimating the clock rate would be to systematically overestimate the dates of events during the epidemic history, while overlooking uncertainty and heterogeneity in the clock rate will cause the credible intervals for some of our parameters and dates to be anti-conservative.",

Although this model contains none of the biological complexity inherent to HCV epidemiology, on statistical grounds, there was no support for even modest elaborations of the SIS or SIR models. The SI, SIS and SIR models may be caricatures of true epidemiological dynamics, but they capture key features of epidemic processes, including exponential, plateau and burn-out phases. In this study, we directly compared the goodness-of-fit of endemic, SI, SIS and SIR models. In practice, a useful approach might be to include the non-parametric Bayesian skyline plot [74] in the model comparison [72] . This would allow rejection of the parametric models if none adequately described the population history of the sample. In such a case, the Bayesian skyline plot might help motivate and direct the construction of new, more realistic, parametric models via our metapopulation approach.",

In stochastic models, b 1 and g and therefore R 0 can, in principle, be deconfounded, but if deterministic models are any guide, precise estimates cannot be expected unless additional information is available concerning, for example, the rate of clearance or prevalence. Fortunately, r 0 will often be a convenient proxy for R 0 because it exhibits the same threshold behaviour: when r 0 ! 0 (equivalently, R 0 ! 1), the infection persists in the population and when r 0 , 0 (equivalently, R 0 , 1), the epidemic dies out.

Although the intrinsic growth rate can be estimated during the exponential growth phase of the epidemic, it is not sufficient to predict the course of the epidemic. Independent estimates of quantities such as the duration of infection and point prevalence would be needed for prediction.

The time of the MRCA is indicated with a red circle ( posterior median) and error bar (95% credible interval).

We dated the T MRCA to between 1955 and 1968. Using the SIR model, we reconstructed the historical number of infected hosts and prevalence (figure 5). We estimated a doubling time between 1.4 and 3.6 years, and dated the peak prevalence to between 1964 and 2008.Although the HCV-6 epidemics in Hong Kong and Thailand appeared to have faster intrinsic growth rates than the HCV-2c epidemic in Argentina, we obtained similar estimates for R 0 and average duration of infectivity for all three datasets. We estimated basic reproductive numbers of 1.20 (95% CI 1.04-5.51), 1.44 (1.08-13.2) and 1.42(1.07-19.0)   in Argentina, Hong Kong and Thailand, respectively. We estimated average durations for the infectious period (1/g) of 1.47 years (95% CI 0.27-27.0), 1.24 years (0.26-14.1) and 1.55 years (0.28-40.0), respectively.
