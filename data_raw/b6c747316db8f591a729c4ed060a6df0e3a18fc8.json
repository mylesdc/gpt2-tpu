In this study, our primary aim was to determine Treg cell frequency in the peripheral blood of children with and without asthma. The secondary aim was to explore the association between Treg cell frequency with allergen sensitization, disease severity and medication use. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy control subjects (N = 93) and asthmatic children of varying disease severity (N = 66) were characterized by multi-parameter flow cytometry.",

Using a multivariate model, increased Treg cell frequency in children with asthma was most directly associated with inhaled corticosteroid use, and not asthma severity, allergic sensitization, or atopic status of the asthma. Conclusion: We conclude that low dose, local airway administration of corticosteroids is sufficient to impact the frequency of Treg cells in the peripheral blood. These data highlight the importance of considering medication exposure when studying Treg cells and suggest inhaled corticosteroid use in asthmatics may improve disease control through increased Treg cell frequency.",

            "text": "The CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cell, a widely accepted T cell subset with immune suppressive properties, was initially thought to exist primarily to prevent autoimmune diseases [1] . Increasing evidence suggests that Treg cells are important in varied immune responses, including allergic diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . A role for Treg cells in allergic disease was first highlighted in Immunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) patients [7, 8] . IPEX patients lack Treg cells and have increased serum IgE levels, skewing of T cell responses toward a Th2 phenotype, and autoimmune endocrinopathies [9] . In allergic disease, the current concept suggests that inadequate Treg cell suppression of effector cells or diminished Treg cell numbers contributes to the development and perpetuation of allergic inflammation [10, 11] . Studies utilizing murine models of allergic asthma provide strong evidence for an essential Treg cell role in modulating allergic airway inflammation [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Two recent clinical studies have suggested that Treg cells in adult asthmatic subjects are elevated while another study demonstrated diminished Treg cells in asthmatic children [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, the role of Treg cells in allergic asthma remains poorly defined, particularly in children when the initiation of allergic asthma most often occurs.",

One of the challenges of identifying Treg cells is the lack of a unique marker. Published studies analyzing human Treg cells have utilized several phenotypic markers including CD25, CD127, and Foxp3. In this study, we used multi-parameter flow cytometry to investigate the frequency of Treg cells in the peripheral blood of children ages 7-8 years with or without asthma. The frequency of Treg cells was further analyzed in relationship to disease severity, allergic sensitization and medication use.",

Flow cytometry was performed in children enrolled in COAST over a one-year period. Children within the cohort were classified as having asthma as defined below. Additional children with a physician diagnosis of asthma were recruited to enrich the sample for children with asthma, and were age-matched to those enrolled in the COAST birth cohort. An effort was made to enroll equal numbers of children with intermittent, mild persistent and moderate/severe persistent asthma.

Medication use was assessed by questionnaire at the study visit. Since asthmatic children were taking medication at enrollment, asthma classification was based on medication use and symptom control. Classification was as follows: 1) children well-controlled without a daily controller medication were classified as intermittent; 2) children well-controlled on low dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist were classified as mild persistent; 3) children requiring medium dose ICS or two classes of controller medication for asthma (ICS + long acting beta agonist, medium dose ICS or medium-high dose ICS + leukotriene receptor antagonist) were classified as moderate persistent; and 4) children requiring high dose ICS plus long-acting beta agonist were classified as severe persistent (medication use in each subject as it relates to asthma severity is listed in Additional file 1). Spirometry was performed using the Jaeger MasterScreen system at the study visit. Eigen criteria for lung function were used, similar to those used in published studies [23, 24] . If the child was ill, requiring albuterol or with asthma symptoms, the visit was rescheduled. Respiratory viral surveillance nasal samples were collected on all subjects for another study. Virology data from a subset of the study patients (N = 49) was analyzed for respiratory viral infections and symptoms were scored as previously described [22] . Respiratory viral panel analysis from 49 subjects demonstrated no viral detection in 43 subjects and 6 subjects were virus positive (2 human rhinovirus, 2 coronavirus, 1 RSV, and 1 influenza). Additionally, symptom scores from 134 of the 159 study subjects were obtained. The majority of subjects (N = 110, 82%) denied recent respiratory infection symptoms at the time of blood draw for flow cytometry. 10 of those 134 were symptomatic: 7 mild (symptom score 1-4) and 3 moderate (symptom score 5-6). All 10 had respiratory viral panel analysis. Viral detection rates were 67% (2/3) for moderate illness, 29% (2/7) for mild illness, and 5% (2/39) for asymptomatic visits.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of allergic asthmatic children analyzed using multi-parameter flow cytometry for Treg cell frequency determination. Our findings demonstrated a statistically significant association between increased frequency of Treg cells and intermittent or chronic ICS use. This association was independent of asthma disease severity, allergic sensitization, gender, BMI, or other atopic disease status. These findings indicate that ICS use is associated with an elevation in Treg cell frequency and that intermittent ICS use is sufficient for this systemic change to occur. This increase in Treg cell frequency observed with ICS use represents 1% of the total CD4+ cells and approximately 17% of the Treg cells. Moreover, these data suggest that inhaled corticosteroids may work by shifting the balance of adaptive immune responses toward Treg cell predominance. Lastly, our findings suggest that ICS treatment is an important covariate to consider in studies of Treg cells in asthma. In this study, CD4 + CD25 + CD127lo/-T cells were used to define Treg cells. Recent work from our group utilizing multi-parameter flow cytometry alongside the demethylation status of a region of the Foxp3 promoter (Treg specific demethylated region,TSDR) found the strongest positive relationship using CD4 + CD25 + CD127lo/-T cells as the Treg cell defining phenotype when compared to CD4 + CD25 + CD127lo/-Foxp3+ T cells [36] . This finding suggests Foxp3 protein levels may not be constantly detectable using flow cytometry in bona fide Treg cells. Thus, multi-parameter flow cytometry using CD25 and CD127 to define Treg cells is reliable for quantification of CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of Foxp3 protein and demethylation at TSDR.",

Smyth et al. demonstrated an increased frequency of CD4 + Foxp3+ T cells in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma compared to mild asthmatics and healthy controls, but did not account for medication use or atopic status of the patients [18] . In our study, all of the moderate-to-severe asthmatics were on ICS, and a subset of the study subjects (16%) had one or more bursts of oral corticosteroids (OCS) during the study period. In contrast to ICS, the use of OCS was not significantly associated with increased Treg cell numbers (p = 0.80, data not shown). Our findings in peripheral blood suggest that the increased frequency of BALF Treg cells in the study by Smyth et al. might also be secondary to ICS use. Hartl et al. studied a small number of children with symptomatic asthma (n = 18) demonstrating diminished BALF Treg cell, defined as CD4 + CD25hi, frequency with normalization after initiation of ICS use compared to control groups [19] .",

In general, our data are in agreement with the observation that ICS use increases Treg cell frequency, and indicate that there are similar changes in the blood and airway. Our data further clarifies the relationship of ICS and Treg cells using a more rigorous definition of Treg cells with multi-parameter flow cytometry, an increased sample size, and presents a more thorough characterization of other atopic characteristics (allergic sensitization, asthma severity, atopic status).",

Alternatively, ICS could alter homing characteristics of Treg cells, or represent a compensatory response to dampen ongoing lung inflammation. Similarly, the positive association between serum IgE and Treg cell frequency could represent a compensatory response to allergic inflammation. Additional studies are warranted to investigate longitudinal changes in Treg cells before and after ICS use. These lines of investigation would help support a mechanism of action for ICS and may serve as a prognostic indicator of response to therapy.",

This relationship suggests that corticosteroid use should be considered when analyzing the frequency of Treg cells in asthma. The modest increase (~17%) in Treg cell frequency was observed even with intermittent ICS use. These findings suggest the possibility that ICS-mediated increases in Treg cell frequency could contribute to the beneficial ICS effects on asthma disease control.",
