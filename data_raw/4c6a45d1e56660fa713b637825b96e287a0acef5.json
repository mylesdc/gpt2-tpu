The in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs. Methods: Nine specific pathogen free dogs were divided into three groups, with each group consisting of one female and two male dogs. Dogs were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with either 1 ml RD114 stock virus (group A), inactivated RD114 virus suspension (group B), or cell culture medium (group C) as a negative control. To assess blood cell counts and biochemical properties, blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation, just prior to inoculation, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days post-inoculation. Result: During the experimental period of 51 days, none of the dogs inoculated with RD114 virus showed any clinical signs, significant increases in rectal temperature or abnormal blood biochemical characteristics including C-reactive protein when compared with the negative controls. We were not able to re-isolate the RD114 virus from buffy coat cells of group A dogs. Additionally, we could not detect RD114 provirus in the genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, spleen and sternal bone marrow cells. Conclusions: Signs of RD114 virus proliferation were not found after subcutaneous infection of dogs. Although the potential risk caused by infection with RD114 virus in dogs could not be assessed in this study, we suspect that RD114 virus has little or no virulence in dogs.",

            "text": "Domestic cats are generally assumed to harbour the infectious endogenous retrovirus RD114 in their genome [1, 2] . It is known that the Crandell-Rees feline kidney cell line is contaminated with an RD114-like virus [3] . Recently, Miyazawa et al. [4] found that certain live attenuated vaccines for dogs were contaminated with infectious RD114 virus. We also confirmed in our laboratory that infectious RD114 virus was present in certain live attenuated canine vaccines that were manufactured using feline cells (unpublished data). The amount of infectious RD114 virus found in manufactured live canine vaccines was as high as 1,800 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/vial (one vial represents a single dose) [4] . RD114 virus can be regarded as an 'exogenous' retrovirus in non-feline species including dogs, however there is no information concerning the etiological features of RD114 virus infection in dogs. The present study was conducted to evaluate the in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus by experimental infection of specific pathogen free (SPF) dogs.",

The principle of the assay is based on the detection of infectious RD114 virus using TE671 (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cells transduced with the LacZ marker gene [TE671(LacZ) cells]. RD114 virus was prepared from the culture supernatant of TE671 cells chronically infected with the virus [7] . Culture supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore size membrane filters, and aliquots stored at -80\u00b0C until required. The titre of the stock virus was approximately 10 5 infectious units/ml. To prepare inactivated RD114 virus as inocula, the stock virus was added to an equal volume of diethylether, then vigorously and intermittently mixed at room temperature (around 20\u00b0C) for 3 min. Absence of infectious RD114 virus in the inactivated viral preparation was confirmed by the LacZ marker rescue assay.",

RD114 virus also actively infects cells from cats and dogs, and may be transmitted to nonfeline species because of the xenotropic features of the virus in vitro [9] . Therefore, if dogs are exposed to a high dose of RD114 virus, the viral genome may integrate into the cells of target tissues. Viraemia is often associated with the acute phase of viral diseases. In clinical cases caused by retroviruses, blood specimens are mainly used for virus detection. However, we were unable to detect RD114 provirus from blood, lymph node, spleen and sternal bone marrow samples using a one-step PCR assay, despite group A dogs being inoculated with approximately 10 5 infectious units of RD114 virus. These results suggest that RD114 did not proliferate and disseminate in the dogs, or that RD114 virus did not proliferate efficiently in the blood cells and hematopoietic system of dogs. The virus stock, neutralized with the sera of each dog, was inoculated onto TE671(LacZ) cells, and the number of lacZ positive foci among the three groups were counted. In the present study, the antibody titres remained unchanged in all dogs following inoculation (data not shown), implying that RD114 virus did not proliferate in dogs.",

The potential risk caused by infection with RD114 virus in dogs cannot be accurately assessed because a longer PI period is required for the verification or exclusion of retroviral infection. It is also possible that dogs younger than 10-months might be more susceptible to RD114 virus infection. Millions of puppies are vaccinated worldwide on an annual basis. Therefore it is impossible to completely rule out adverse effects of the infection. Many exogenous retroviruses cause leukaemia and tumours in a wide variety of animal species, and further research is required to isolate or detect RD114 virus in dogs that have developed leukaemia and tumours following use of live canine vaccines manufactured using feline cells. Hopefully, such research would clarify the possible relationship between the occurrence of diseases in dogs and vaccination.",

Genomic DNA extracted from the buffy coat samples of dogs (n = 3 for each group) in three groups (A: RD114 virus inoculated group; B: inactivated virus group; C: control group) was tested for the presence of RD114 virus.
