HCV is an important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to the need for liver transplantation. In this study, curcumin, a constituent used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been evaluated for its anti-HCV activity and mechanism, using a human hepatoma cell line containing the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon. Below the concentration of 20% cytotoxicity, curcumin dose-dependently inhibited HCV replication by luciferase reporter gene assay, HCV RNA detection and HCV protein analysis. Under the same conditions, curcumin also dose-dependently induced heme oxygenase-1 with the highest induction at 24 h. Hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 inducer, also inhibited HCV protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. The knockdown of heme oxygenase-1 partially reversed the curcumin-inhibited HCV protein expression. In addition to the heme oxygenase-1 induction, signaling molecule activities of AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) were inhibited by curcumin. Using specific inhibitors of PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK and NF-\u03baB, the results suggested that only PI3K-AKT inhibition is positively involved in curcumin-inhibited HCV replication. Inhibition of ERK and NF-\u03baB was likely to promote HCV protein expression. In summary, curcumin inhibited HCV replication by heme oxygenase-1 induction and AKT pathway inhibition. Although curcumin also inhibits ERK and NF-\u03baB activities, it slightly increased the HCV protein expression. This result may provide information when curcumin is used as an adjuvant in anti-HCV therapy.",

It is an important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to a need for liver transplantation (2, 3) . Treatment of chronic HCV is currently based on the combination of pegylated interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and the nucleotide analogue ribavirin, which is only effective in approximately 50% of the patients, especially in HCV genotype 1 (4, 5) . HCV belongs to the Hepacivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family, and is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of ~9.6 kb. The HCV genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a large polyprotein precursor of 3011 amino acids. The ORF is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The precursor polyprotein is processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 proteins: structural (core, E1 and E2), and non-structural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) (3, 6) . There are six major genotypes in HCV classification (3) . The major prevalent type in Southern Taiwan is HCV 1b, which is the most resistant type to interferon therapy (5, 7) .",

Curcumin-induced HO-1 expression was first found in human endothelial cells (17) , suggesting that a low dose of curcumin induced HO-1 expression, which provided an intrinsic antioxidant ability. Curcumin also induced HO-1 expression in mesangial (18) and liver cells (19) (20) (21) , as well as in macrophages (22, 23) .

In general, NF-\u03baB is of great importance in signal transduction pathways involved in chronic and acute inflammatory diseases, as well as various types of cancer, therefore, it is a good target for cancer prevention (30) . Various reports have demonstrated the correlation between curcumin and NF-\u03baB. One of those reports suggests the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin, which suppresses the ox-LDL-induced MCP-1 expression via the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (31) . The anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin has been reported to be due to the I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB system in rat and human intestinal epithelial cells, including IEC-6, HT-29 and Caco-2 cells (32) . Curcumin has also been found to have anti-metastatic properties via the inhibition of NF-\u03baB in the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (33) . Another signaling pathway, Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), is of crucial importance in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, survival, as well as the transmission of oncogenic signals (34) . This pathway has also been reported to be a target of curcumin. For example, curcumin inhibited connective tissue growth factor gene expression by suppressing ERK signaling in activated hepatic stellate cells (35) . Moreover, curcumin inhibited phorbol myristate acetate-induced MCP-1 gene expression by inhibiting ERK and NF-\u03baB activities in U937 cells (36) . However, the manner in which curcumin affects the activities of NF-\u03baB and ERK in HCV-infected hepatoma cells has yet to be determine.",

In HCV-infected cells, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is involved in certain pathological mechanisms. For example, the activities of PI3K, AKT and their downstream target mTOR are increased in the HCV-replicating cells (45) . HCV NS5A binds to PI3K, while enhancing the phosphotransferase activity of the catalytic domain (46) . The HCV-activated PI3K-AKT contributes to cell survival enhancement. In addition to cell survival, AKT leads to the protein accumulation of SREBP-1, an important transcription factor regulating genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (47) . HCV NS4B has been found to enhance the protein expression levels of SREBPs and fatty acid synthase through PI3K activity, subsequently inducing a lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells (48) . Therefore, inhibition of the PI3K-SREBP signaling pathway should decrease the HCV-induced HCC development and the cellular fatty acid level. Curcumin has been reported to inhibit HCV replication via suppression of the AKT-SREBP-1 pathway (14) . In the present study, data also demonstrated that curcumin-inhibited PI3K-AKT was slightly involved in the anti-HCV activity of curcumin.",

The HCV core protein has been shown to activate NF-\u03baB, inducing resistance to TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells (57) . HCV NS2 activates the IL-8 gene expression by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway in HepG2 cells (58) . In the infectious JFH1 model, HCV is suggested to enhance hepatic fibrosis progression through the induction of TGF-\u03b21, mediated by a ROS-induced and NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway (59) . These evidences indicate that the activation of NF-\u03baB by HCV induces hepatic disease progression. In this study, the NF-\u03baB expression is abundant in the cytoplasm of Huh7.5 cells, expressing the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon (Fig. 5B) . The absence of NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation indicates that NF-\u03baB is not likely to participate in the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in this cell line. The absense of complete HCV core and HCV NS2 sequences in the subgenomic replicon used in this study, is likely to be the reason for the absence of NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. Therefore, it is likely to contribute to the inability of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor to suppress the HCV protein expression in this cell line. In fact, the genomic variation of HCV core protein generates a distinct functional regulation of NF-\u03baB, which may inhibit or activate NF-\u03baB activity (60) .",
