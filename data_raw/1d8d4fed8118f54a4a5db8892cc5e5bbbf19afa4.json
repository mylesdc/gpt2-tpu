            "text": "Purpose: Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been tested in veterinary medicine as a treatment option for multiple gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there are no reports of changes in the microbial diversity of fecal microbiome after treatment with FMT in canine IBD cases. Moreover, little is known about the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT treatment for dogs. Herein, we present a case of canine intractable IBD treated with repeated, long-term FMT. Patients and methods: The patient was a 10-year-old, neutered, male, 4-kg Toy Poodle with a prolonged history of vomiting and diarrhea. Fecal examination for pathogens was negative. Despite treatment with multiple antibacterial and antidiarrheal agents, the patient showed no improvement. Endoscopic mucus sampling diagnosed a case of lymphocyticplasmacytic duodenitis, ie, idiopathic IBD. Eventually, we performed periodic, long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces collected from a 4-year-old, 32.8-kg, neutered male Golden Retriever by rectal enema. Additionally, we performed 16S rRNA sequence analysis, before and after FMT, to evaluate the microbiome diversity. Results: Fecal microbiome diversity after FMT resembled that of the healthy donor dog's fecal microbiome, before FMT, which led us to conclude that the fecal microbiome in our patient normalized with FMT. Moreover, the clinical symptoms improved remarkably with regard to the changes in the fecal microbiome. Additionally, we noted no observable side effects during FMT treatment. Conclusion: This report indicates the efficacy and safety of long-term, periodic FMT for a case of canine IBD based on attenuation of clinical symptoms and changes in fecal microbiome diversity. Therefore, FMT could be chosen as a treatment option for IBD in canines in the future.",

Before FMT, the predominant bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria (52.2%) and Firmicutes, comprising 28.4% of the total bacterial population.

            "text": "We performed 16S rRNA sequence analysis to evaluate the microbial diversity in the feces of the dog with IBD after each round of treatment with FMT. A previous study reported that the proportion of Proteobacteria was 5-7% and Fusobacteria was 23-40% in the fecal microbiome of healthy dogs. 11 In our study, the proportion of Proteobacteria was 3.2% and that of Fusobacteria was 24.5% in the feces of the healthy donor dog. Before FMT, the proportion of Proteobacteria was high (52.2%) in the feces of our patient; however, Fusobacteria was undetectable. We identified a significant difference in the fecal microbiome diversity between our patient and the healthy dog. Dysbiosis refers to the abnormal constitution of the microbiome, and is commonly observed in animals with acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases. [12] [13] [14] Furthermore, it is generally assumed that Gammaproteobacteria, included in Proteobacteria, evoke dysbiosis and cause an imbalance of the enteral environment. 8, 15, 16 There was a lower proportion of Fusobacteria in the patient's feces than in that of the healthy dog. 8, 11, 16 However, several studies have reported that Fusobacterium has been implicated as a proinflammatory [17] [18] [19] and has been found in a higher abundance of IBD patients in mouse model and human. 19 It was suggested that Fusobacterium caused colitis-associated colorectal cancer in the mouse model and the human. Although Fusobacteria may be the risk factor in mouse and human, the low rate of Fusobacteria may be specific for canine IBD. Therefore, the population of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria may be related to the clinical GI symptoms in the present case of canine IBD. We propose that a high proportion of Proteobacteria and a low proportion of Fusobacteria may be a characteristic feature of canine IBD.",

This fecal microbiome diversity was similar to that of the donor's fecal microbiome, which allows us to conclude that the diversity of the fecal microbiome was normalized by FMT in the present case of canine IBD. Moreover, our observations confirmed that changes in the fecal microbiome diversity indeed affected the clinical symptoms of IBD, and hence, contributed to the efficacy of FMT treatment. Although reports indicate FMT to be a safe procedure for short-term treatment, 2 only few studies have reported on the safety of long-term FMT procedures. Since the completion of the 10th round, we have continued performing FMT regularly, once every 3 weeks, till date. There have been no observed side effects, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, associated with the FMT procedure. Therefore, we report that long-term FMT treatment for canine IBD is safe.",

Therefore, we were unable to confirm any changes in the intestinal mucosa resulting from FMT in this case. FMT is trial treatment in this case, hence it does not cost. Also, there is no risk of anesthesia and no side effect is observed up to this point of this trial.
