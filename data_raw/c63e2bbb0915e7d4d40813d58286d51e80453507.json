We propose a novel influenza vaccine composing a bacterial carrier and a plasmid cargo. In the immunized subjects, the bacterial carrier invades and releases its cargo into host cells where the plasmid expresses viral RNAs and proteins for reconstitution of attenuated influenza virus. Here we aimed to construct a mouse PolI-driven plasmid for efficient production of influenza virus. Results: A plasmid was constructed to express all influenza viral RNAs and proteins. This all-in-one plasmid resulted in 10 5 -10 6 50 % tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/mL of influenza A virus in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells on the third day post-transfection, and also reconstituted influenza virus in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. A 6-unit plasmid was constructed by deleting the HA and NA cassettes from the all-in-one plasmid. Cotransfection of BHK-21 cells with the 6-unit plasmid and the two other plasmids encoding the HA or NA genes resulted in influenza virus titers similar to those produced by the 1-plasmid method.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, which are characterized by segmented negative sense RNA genomes. The viral RNAs (vRNAs) are bound by nucleoprotein (NP) and three viral polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, the minimal replication unit [1] [2] [3] . Influenza vRNAs have conserved 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminals that contain all the signals necessary for transcription, replication, and packaging [4, 5] . vRNAs with precise 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends are generally obtained using the RNA polymerase I (PolI) promoter [6, 7] . Viral polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein are synthesized under the regulation of the RNA polymerase II (PolII) promoter [8] . To generate influenza virus, pure plasmid-based reverse genetics systems are developed using 12-17 plasmids [9, 10] . Invention of the PolI-PolII bidirectional transcription vector results in a more robust 8-plasmid system [11, 12] . Due to the fact that PolI promoters are species-specific [13] , different reverse genetics systems are developed for primate, avian, and canine cells [9, [14] [15] [16] . A universal T7 promoterbased system has been built, but shows less efficiency than the PolI-based bidirectional transcription system [17] . Through tandem ligation of multiple viral gene cassettes, influenza virus is reconstituted using a 3-plasmid system [18] , and a single DNA construct [19, 20] .",

            "text": "An important application of reverse genetics is the generation of influenza vaccine seed viruses [21] [22] [23] . Usually, seasonal influenza vaccine is composed of two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus. Using the reverse genetics method, each seed virus is generated with HA and NA from a circulating strain, and the remaining six segments from a high-yield strain or an attenuated strain [24] [25] [26] . Nonetheless, manufacture of the vaccines still heavily relies on embryonated hens' eggs or cell culture to grow the viruses [27] , two time-consuming processes which are unlikely to provide adequate vaccines for a sudden influenza pandemic. The majority of vaccines are administered through intramuscular injection or by individually nasal spray, two labor-intensive ways which further increase the cost of current vaccines in vaccinating huge flocks of birds. To develop a quick-manufacturable and low-cost influenza vaccine, we proposed that an influenza viral genome-encoding plasmid could be delivered in vivo by a bacterial carrier, resulting in production of attenuated influenza viruses to induce protective immunity against influenza [19] . In a feasibility study, we constructed a chicken PolI-driven plasmid expressing all vRNAs, NP and polymerase from a influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) [19] . Generation of influenza virus was found in cultured avian cells infected by auxotrophic Salmonella strains carrying the plasmid or its derivatives, but not in chickens inoculated with the recombinant Salmonella [28] . The study proved that a single plasmid could be constructed to reconstitute influenza virus and stably maintained in engineered Salmonella strains. The engineered Salmonella could deliver the plasmid into host cells resulting in generation of live influenza virus. Nonetheless, to make the hypothesized influenza vaccine, the one-plasmid reverse genetics system still needs to be improved in virus generation efficiency, and the Salmonella carrier has to be engineered to deliver plasmid efficiently, especially in vivo.",

EGFP expression was observed in BHK-21 cells only when pYA4924 has been cotransfected with plasmids encoding influenza polymerase and NP (Data not shown), suggesting that the cloned MPI is functional in hamster cells. By combining MPI with the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (SV40 pA, 131 bp), truncated mouse PolI terminator (MTI, 41 bp), and functional truncated CMV promoter (188 bp), a bidirectional CMV/MPI-driven transcription vector, pYA4963, was constructed. Two BsmBI sites were designed between MPI and MTI to allow precise insertion of influenza cDNA. A BamHI site was designed between the two BsmBI sites. By inserting a prokaryotic GFPexpression cassette at the BamHI site, an easy-to-use bidirectional vector pYA4964 was constructed (Fig. 1) . Substitution of the GFP cassette with influenza cDNA resulted in loss of green fluorescence in bacterial host cells.

The vaccine can be quickly propagated in simple media in large scale, and potentially be orally administered. In vivo delivery of the influenza plasmid results in generation of attenuated influenza virus which in turn induces protective immunity. The feasibility study showed that such a form of recombinant bacteria could be constructed and used to mediate generation of influenza virus [28] . As expected, there are limiting factors still needing to be overcome, such as inefficient virus generation from the influenza plasmid.

The CHO cells, another hamster cell line, only yielded merely detectable influenza virus. One reason is that CHO cells do not have \u03b1-2, 6 SAlinked receptor to support influenza virus propagation [37, 38] . These two hamster cell lines may help determine the mechanism limiting nuclear import of the large size plasmid and the factors inhibiting virus generation.

The resulting plasmids were pYA4978 (NP, GFP), pYA4977 (PB1, GFP), pYA4980 (NS, GFP), and pYA4979 (NA, GFP). c The PA, PB2, M, and HA cassettes were amplified from pYA4967 (PA), pYA4966 (PB2), pYA4971 (M), and pYA4969 (HA) to replace the GFP cassettes in the 1-unit plasmids from step b. The resulting 2-unit plasmids were pYA4982 (NP, PA), pYA4981 (PB1, PB2), pYA4984 (NS, M), and pYA4983 (NA, HA). d The GFP cassettes were amplified from pYA4964 and inserted into three of the 2-unit plasmids. The resulting plasmids were pYA4986 (NP, PA, GFP), pYA4985 (PB1, PB2, GFP), and pYA4987 (NS, M, GFP). e The AsiSI-XmaI fragments from plasmids pYA4986 (NP, PA, GFP) and pYA4985 (PB1, PB2, GFP) were combined to obtain a 4-unit plasmid pYA4988 (NP, PA, PB1, PB2, GFP). The AsiSI-XmaI fragments from plasmids pYA4987 (NS, M, GFP) and pYA4983 (NA, HA) were combined to obtain another 4-unit plasmid pYA4989 (NS, M, NA, HA). f The two 4-unit plasmids were digested with BssHII and XmaI. Combination of the fragments containing influenza cassettes resulted in the all-in-one plasmid pYA4990. The PA, PB2, M, HA, and GFP cassettes had triple C (CCC) at their 3\u2032-end for connecting to the SmaI-generated blunt end (as shown by primer sequence in Table 3 ). The SmaI and XmaI endonucleases were isoschizomers. For clarity, each element is labeled at only one location in plasmid pYA4990 adapted virus [26, 39, 40] . Since the backbone encoding segments remain the same every year, they can be used to make a 6-cassete plasmid. The 6-cassete plasmid forms a 3-plasmid reverse genetics system with the two plasmids encoding HA and NA genes. This \"1 + 2\" approach was proven successful in the BHK-21 cells (Table 2) . We then tested virus generation in CHO cells which have been used to produce human vaccines and other therapeutics for many years [31] . The all-in-one plasmid could reconstitute low titers of influenza virus in CHO cells, but the \"1 + 2\" strategy was not successful. This may be overcome by using CHO cells expressing influenza receptor [41] [42] [43] , or coculture of CHO and MDCK cells. On the other hand, it also suggests that a more comprehensive system yields higher titers of virus [18] . The 3-plasmid system should reconstituteseed virus more efficiently than an 8-plasmid system in CEF, Vero cells and MDCK cells [44] . In other circumstance, if one needs to generate a large number of influenza viruses merely different in one gene, such as NP, a 7-cassette plasmid may be constructed to compose a 2-plasmid system with the NP plasmid. If just numerous influenza viruses need to be generated, it is not worth the time to construct a complicated plasmid, and an 8-plasmid system should be used.",

The mouse PolI promoter was found to be active in hamster cell lines, but showed very poor or no activity in MDCK cells. The results suggest that it is an inefficient process to produce the first viral particle in MDCK cells transfected by the all-in-one plasmid as a result of poor vRNA transcription. However, once a live influenza viral particle is generated, it can replicate rapidly in MDCK cells. Like the finding with CHO cells, the 3-plasmid system did not reconstitute influenza virus in MDCK cells. This is because cotransfection of three plasmids into MDCK cells is less efficient than a plasmid, and leads to even less vRNA production in canine cells.",

The MPI was amplified from pYA4924 with primers P9 and P10. The 41-bp MTI was introduced by primers P7 and P10. A DNA fragment containing BglII-CMV-MTI-BsmBI-BamHI-BsmBI-MPI-SV40pA was obtained by fusing the three PCR products with primers P5 and P8. The purified PCR product was digested with BglII and ligated into pcDNA3.1(\u2212) digested with BstZ17I and BglII to replace the DNA fragment containing the CMV promoter, the bovine growth hormone (BGH) pA, and the neo cassette. The resulting bidirectional vector was designated as pYA4963. To make an easy-to-use vector, Fig. 4 Analysis of gene expression in BHK-21, CHO, and MDCK cells. The cells were transfected with reporter plasmids carrying a CMV-driven mCherry cassette. The large pYA4732 plasmid showed significantly lower mCherry expression in CHO cells than the small pYA4731 plasmid. Cells were also cotransfected with pYA4732 and pYA4924. The EGFP expression indicated that vRNA-like EGFP RNA was generated from pYA4924 and converted into mRNA for EGFP synthesis in the presence of the influenza NP and polymerase provided by pYA4732. Compared with BHK-21 and CHO cells, very few MDCK cells expressed EGFP. Expression of EGFP and mCherry were recorded from the same field the prokaryotic expression GFP cassette was amplified from pYA4332 with primers BglII-lpp and BglII-5ST1T2. The GFP cassette was digested with BglII and ligated into the pYA4963 vector that was digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP); the resulting plasmid was pYA4964 (Fig. 1) . The linearized and ready-to-use pYA4964 was prepared by removing the GFP cassette with BsmBI. From the chicken PolI promoter based 8-plasmid system pYA4383 (PB2), pYA4384 (PB1), pYA4385 (PA), pYA4386 (NP), pYA4388 (HA), pYA4389 (NA), pYA4390 (M), and pYA4391 (NS) [19] , the influenza A virus (A/WSN/ 33(H1N1)) genes were amplified by PCR and digested with BsmBI or AarI. Each treated gene was cloned individually into the linearized pYA4964. Only colonies that did not show green fluorescence under excitation of 488 nm were selected and verified by restriction digestion of the plasmid DNA. The resulting mouse RNA PolIdriven 8-plasmid system included plasmids pYA4965 (PB1), pYA4966 (PB2), pYA4967 (PA), pYA4968 (NP), pYA4969 (HA), pYA4970 (NA), pYA4971 (M), and pYA4972 (NS). Using primers engineered with unique restriction enzyme cleavage sites, the influenza gene cassettes were amplified from the mouse PolI-driven plasmids. An allin-one plasmid pYA4990 was constructed by combining all of the cassettes (Fig. 2) . The pYA4990 was sequenced with 54 primers that target influenza genes (not shown). To construct a 6-unit plasmid without HA and NA cassettes, the pYA4990 was digested by PacI and SmaI.
