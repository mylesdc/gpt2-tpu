            "text": "The success of oral infection by viruses depends on their capacity to overcome the gut epithelial barrier of their host to crossing over apical, mucous extracellular matrices. As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect gut barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut epithelium; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest Spodoptera frugiperda. Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall gut function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the gut barrier in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.",

            "text": "The transmission of parvoviruses predominantly occurs by horizontal routes through inhalation or oral exposure, making interaction with mucosal epithelia a crucial part of their pathogenesis (for review [1] ). The oral route represents a major challenge for viruses as they need to overcome a diversity of barriers to invade their host. Indeed, most animal epithelia are covered in their apical surface by a carbohydrate-rich meshwork of various complexity and thickness, the glycocalyx, which can be coated by an additional layer of secreted mucus [2] . These structures constitute successive protective surfaces where viruses aggregate and either access to attachment factors and receptors at the surface of the epithelial cells or are eliminated by luminal or cilia movements [3] . This dual fate depends on the virus affinity for glycans, which must allow to escape the trap of the mucus. The diversity of glycans present on the epithelial surfaces vary between and within species and therefore constitute an important component of the innate immunity and of the species barrier [4] .",

They can cause diseases of various severity in a wide range of animals. Parvovirus interest in human and animal health or in biomedicine as vectors for gene transfer, has long focused research to understand their cell tropism and entry mechanisms. A number of cellular attachment factors and receptors have been characterized, mostly for vertebrates' parvoviruses. They highlight the importance of glycans in capsid recognition and binding specificity [6] [7] [8] . However, how capsids interact with epithelia remains poorly known, mainly due to difficulties to reconstitute in cellular models the complexity of animal epithelial systems [9, 10] .",

The mechanisms determining densovirus specificity are poorly known. Depending on species, densovirus replication can be either restricted to or exclude the gut, viral particles being then transported across the epithelium by transcytosis to reach internal organs where replication goes [11] [12] [13] [14] . Only one cellular receptor has been so far characterized for a \"gut restricted\" densovirus. It is a mucin of the gut of the silkworm Bombyx mori, whose inactivation makes silkworms resistant to infection with the Bombyx mori densovirus type 1 (BmDV) [15] . We have previously reported that gut transcytosis of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) involves a gut specific receptor-dependent mechanism in caterpillars [12] . However, the mechanisms used by viral particles to overcome the successive intestinal barriers of different structures and composition remain elusive.",

The midgut section is endodermal and has no cuticle but is covered in most insects by a semi-permeable membrane, named the peritrophic matrix (PM) (for review [16] ). The PM forms a highly organized lattice of chitin fibrils associated with glycoproteins, mainly peritrophins that have a chitin-binding domain [17, 18] .

Sequence tag preparation was done with Illumina's Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (version 2.1B) as described in [36] . For fourth libraries, 10 \u00b5g of total RNA were incubated with oligo-dT beads. First-and second-strand cDNA syntheses were performed using superscript II reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were cleaved using the NlaIII anchoring enzyme. Subsequently, digested cDNAs were ligated with the GEX adapter 1 containing a restriction site for MmEI. The second digestion with MmeI was performed, which cuts 17 bp downstream of the CATG site. At this point, the fragments detach from the beads. The GEX adapter 2 was ligated to the 3 end of the tag. A PCR amplification with 15 cycles using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) was performed with primers complementary to the adapter sequences to enrich the samples for the desired fragments. The resulting fragments of 85 bp were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (0.45 \u00b5m), precipitated, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and quantified using Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

After hybridization of the sequencing primer to the single-stranded products, 18 cycles of base incorporation were carried out on the 1G analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline, where sequence tags were obtained after purity filtering.

To assess the PM barrier function against densovirus infection, we disrupted its structure by feeding third instar (L3) larvae with sub lethal doses (0.5%) of the chitin-binding agent Calcofluor White prior JcDV infection [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . We then measured larval mortality rates daily. Results showed that JcDV infected larvae pre-treated with Calcofluor displayed a significant shorter median time to death (LT50) compared to untreated infected larvae (7 vs. 9 days p.i. for control larvae; p < 0.01) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Materials Figure S1 ), supporting that the PM can limit JcDV infection. Noteworthy, an increased larval mortality was also observed at late time post-treatment with Calcofluor in mock-infected caterpillars compared to untreated controls (18% at 10 days p.i.), confirming a detrimental inhibition of chitin assembly on larval development [41] . Larvae (n = 24) were infected individually by feeding with JcDV (10 9 veg/caterpillar) concomitantly with 0.5% (5 \u00b5g) of Calcofluor or PBS as a control. Caterpillar mortality was recorded once a day during 10 days and results were presented as survival rates per day. Three independent experiments were performed, each independent experiment gave similar results, one is represented here.

            "text": "The rapid recognition of the PM by JcDV capsids suggests that their affinity for glycans is important for the oral infection process. To test this hypothesis, we first assayed the capsid ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, a feature displayed by vertebrate parvoviruses [45, 46] . We performed a typical hemagglutination assay, adding serial dilutions of the virus inoculum to rabbit erythrocytes ( Figure 2 ). The first dilutions (1:2 and 1:4) of JcDV triggered a strong hemolysis of erythrocytes suggesting a toxic effect of the viral inoculum, ie capsids or some host-derived component associated with the inoculum. It is worthy to note that we use semi-purified inoculum as it mimics naturally occurring infections. JcDV was therefore further purified on a density gradient (P_JcDV) and similarly assayed for hemagglutination. A clear hemagglutination was obtained with P_JcDV, supporting that toxicity is likely due to a host-derived component that can be eliminated during the purification process. Hemagglutination with P_JcDV was obtained up to the third dilution (hemagglutination titer of 1:8), which indicates a rather weak interaction of the capsids with glycans at the surface of (mammalian) erythrocytes. To better understand capsid affinity for glycans, we performed a competition bioassay using monomeric glycans as JcDV-binding competitors. JcDV binding was revealed with an immunofluorescence staining on the PMs using a specific anti-capsid antibody. We quantified this fluorescence as a proxy of binding and competition. We first performed competition ex vivo on isolated PMs incubated with JcDV in the presence of four monosaccharides commonly found in insects [47] , ie N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), which is the monomeric unit of chitin, N-Acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), D-Fucose and D-Mannose (Figure 3 ). We first verified with a dot blot assay that capsids interaction with monosaccharides were not interfering with antibody recognition, which validated the competition bioassay (Supplementary Materials Figure S2 ). As shown in Figure 3 , JcDV binding resulted in an intense fluorescence signal on the PMs (left panel), which was similarly competed away by the four monosacharides and within a similar concentration range (0.5 mM to 5 mM). We noted that fluorescence quantification did not result in a strictly linear dose-dependent effect. To further test the role of glycans in JcDV pathogenesis, we carried out these competition bioassays in vivo (Figure 4 and Supplementary Materials Figure S3 ). We mixed JcDV with each monosaccharide prior infection, fed caterpillars with these inocula and calculated mortality rates daily as in Figure 1 . Results showed that oral infection with 5 mM (but not 5 \u00b5M) of each monosaccharide significantly delayed the median time to death (LT50) of caterpillars (7 vs. 6 days; p < 0.05 for 5 mM) ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Materials Figure S3A ,B), further supporting that PM recognition is the first step of JcDV oral infection. To confirm these results and reveal JcDV binding and competition for binding the PM in vivo, we carried out midgut semi-thin sections and immunofluorescence as above. Caterpillars were infected with JcDV mixed or not with 5 mM GlcNAc and sacrificed at 2 h p.i. for midgut isolation and preparation. As shown in Figure 4B , we observed a red fluorescence signal in untreated infected caterpillars that typically lines the PM. In addition, labelling was also observed in the lumen, likely revealing JcDV interaction with food bolus and/or microbial components. Both signals were strongly and specifically decreased following competition with GlcNAc ( Figure 4B) , showing that different GlcNAc-containing glycans in the gut lumen can recognize the capsids. Control caterpillars were fed with PBS. Three independent experiments were performed, each independent experiment gave similar results, one is represented here. The log-rank (Mantel-cox) and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests were used to determine statistical significance. p Values of less than 0.05 were considered significant (ns, non-significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001). (B) Immunolabeling of midgut semithin transversal sections 2 h after ingestion of JcDV alone or JcDV (10 9 veg/caterpillar) incubated for 1 h with 5 mM of GlcNAc before oral infection. Control caterpillars were fed with PBS. The PM is shown by an arrowhead. Phalloidin-FITC is in green, JcDV is in red, and nuclei are labeled with Dapi (blue). Bars, 30 \u00b5m.

Control caterpillars were injected with PBS. Three independent experiments were performed, each independent experiment gave similar results, one is represented here. The log-rank (Mantel-cox) and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests were used to determine statistical significance, p > 0.05 were considered non-significant (ns).

These cells express glycan structures of various complexity that are attached to the cell surface or secreted and forming extracellular matrices, whose glycans might be similarly targeted by JcDV for attachment. We performed competition bioassays in vivo, bypassing the midgut by injecting caterpillars with JcDV mixed or not with 5 mM of each monosaccharide. Interestingly, the median time to death was similar for all conditions ( Figure 4C and Supplementary Materials Figure S3C ; p > 0.05), showing that none of the monosaccharides competed with JcDV infection proceeding by the systemic route.",

Total proteins were extracted from isolated PMs, separated with SDS-PAGE and either stained with PAGE Blue and Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) in order to visualize total and glycosylated proteins respectively, or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for VOPBA. We included porcine mucins as a control of highly (O-)glycosylated proteins. At the first glance, VOPBA revealed that JcDV binds to most if not all the PM proteins labelled by PAGE blue and PAS combined, although with different intensities ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, no binding was observed with the porcine mucins which might support some specificity for insect glycans. More specifically, a set of JcDV-interacting proteins was identified at high molecular weights (>250 kDa) including proteins with a pattern similar to porcine mucins. These proteins were labelled with PAGE blue and PAS or only with PAS suggesting that they are mostly and probably highly glycosylated ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, proteins at 180 kDa displayed a higher intensity as they are in a relative lower amount (according to PAGE blue), which suggests higher affinity for JcDV. Proteins interacting with JcDV were detected at 150-200 kDa and 25-60 kDa, and corresponding to proteins with low or no glycosylation (according to PAS staining). Thirty \u00b5g of porcine mucins were also loaded in the gel as a control of highly O-glycosylated proteins. Proteins were then stained with Page Blue or Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS, pink) to visualize total or glycosylated proteins, respectively, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with JcDV and anti-JcDV capsid antibody. Proteins interacting with JcDV capsids were finally revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (black arrowheads on the VOPBA JcDV membrane); the corresponding positions of these bands were reported on the Page blue and PAS gels and indicated as well by black arrowheads on the right of these gels.",

            "text": "JcDV recognition and binding to glycans of the PM concentrates viral particles close to the epithelial surface, which raised questions about the mechanism involved to cross over and reach the midgut receptor(s). We hypothesized that capsids aggregation on the matrix can result in its disorganization, in a way similar to chitin-binding wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin or Calcofluor [53] . To test this hypothesis, we used fluorescent WGA-labelling (WGA-FITC) to label chitin and thus examine chitin fibrils formation and PM organization. Third-instar caterpillars were fed with JcDV and then sacrificed at 1 day p.i. to dissect and prepare midguts for semi-thin sections and WGA labelling. As shown in Figure 7 , the labelling of the PM (green) lined the apical surface of the epithelium in non-infected larvae (PBS condition, Figure 7 , upper panel). In addition, we observed a specific labelling at the apex of columnar cells, probably corresponding to microvillar secretion of GlcNAc from these cells. By contrast, the labelling lining the epithelium appeared discontinuous following infection (Figure 7, lower panel) , displaying a disorganized pattern reminiscent of the PM structure observed for caterpillars fed with the WGA lectin [53] . Moreover, intracellular labelling was no longer observed in the sections from infected caterpillars suggesting an arrest of GlcNAc secretion from the cells following early infection, i.e., before we can detect virus replication in subepithelial tissues [13] . These results thus support the hypothesis that JcDV binding on the PM and transcytosis is associated with a loss in its integrity, which might reveal gut dysfunction. To determine the midgut response following JcDV break in, we analyzed the transcriptomic response. We used Digital Gene Expression (DGE) based on the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression approach [35] . This method involves the sequencing and quantification of end tagged short cDNA fragments (i.e., Tags), which enables quantitative differential gene-expression analysis. We built four cDNA libraries from midguts of mock-and infected larvae (Supplementary Materials Tables S2 and S3) . Tag sequences were mapped to the genome and transcriptome of S. frugiperda ( [33, 38] ) and to the JcDV genome. None of the tags were assigned to viral transcripts, which is consistent with JcDV pathogenesis excluding replication in midgut cells [13] . Pie charts represented GO assignment corresponding to unique transcripts at 1 and 3 days p.i. that displayed a differential expression at least 5-fold up-or down-regulated (Supplementary Materials Figure S4A,B) . Interestingly, the distribution of GO terms was roughly similar at 1 and 3 days p.i., suggesting that the overall intestinal response to JcDV oral infection was poorly affected by virus replication going on in subepithelial tissues (Supplementary Materials Figure S4A ,B). We observed only GO terms enrichment for the over-represented transcripts at 1-day p.i., more specifically in functions involved in metabolic processes including translation (i.e., regulation of biological processes, response to stimuli and signaling) at 1 day p.i., that might indicate that JcDV intrusion induces a rapid metabolic response in the gut (Figure 8 ). Interestingly, these changes did not change significantly at 3 days p.i. suggesting that the gut response is rapidly initiated by JcDV transcytosis and was not affected by the viral replication that takes place in underlying tissues. We did not observe any significant activation of genes involved in \"inflammation\" nor in the canonical gut immune response. However, we observed an increased expression in cytochrome P450 and catalase genes that might indicate a response of the cells to the ongoing infection. Table S4 ), we only observed few changes including a trehalose transporter and an intestinal mucin, both down-regulated from day 1 p.i., and a chitinase up-regulated at day 3 p.i.. Except for an aminopeptidase N, no gene corresponding to the JcDV interacting proteins identified by VOPBA displayed a transcriptional change.",

We found that capsids can bind to the different components of the PM and their agglutination on the PM surface is associated with the disruption of its organization.

We used competitions assays with monosaccharides to test this \"bind and release\" hypothesis and our results showed that indeed, capsids have an affinity for glycans, although the concentration range of the monosaccharides (mM) we tested likely indicates their poor affinity for the capsids. As these monosaccharides could compete capsids away from the PM further suggests that glycan-capsids interaction are probably of low affinity.",

Our experiments show that capsid binding results in a structural disorganization of the PM similar to effects induced by chitin-binding lectin WGA and Calcofluor. Such capsid-induced disruption of the PM thus favors a second hypothesis, involving a \"saturate and pass through\" mechanism, where bound capsids are not released but open a way for viral particles to cross over. Such \"cooperative\" mechanism of the capsids to overcome the PM is supported by the fact that PM disruption is enhanced by virus concentration and decreased as caterpillars age. Such developmental resistance of S. frugiperda has been also reported following baculovirus infections and a high synergism with Calcofluor was obtained at late instars (e.g., > 60-fold at 4th instar vs. 3 to 6-fold at 2nd and 3rd instars) [54] .The structure and the composition of the PM can vary as caterpillars grow and feed, or between populations, which might impact virus-PM interactions and consequently insect susceptibility [16, 17, 55] . Whether PM disruption results from mechanical stresses on chitin fibers similar to calcofluor and probably WGA lectins or from an enzymatic activity of the capsids (i.e., of VP4) remains to be analyzed more thoroughly. Understanding the early interaction of JcDV with the glycans of the PM within species, i.e., along the larval development is of importance to develop biocontrol strategies against insect pests.",

Indeed, plants contain compounds that can interfere with PM synthesis, which has been shown to consequently affect baculovirus infection [55] (Chen et al., 2018) . Regarding bacteria, it has been shown recently that the PM controls commensal bacteria, and conversely that its synthesis and integrity can be microbiota-dependent, i.e., the gut microbiota inducing the expression of components of the peritrophic matrix [62, 63] . So, it is plausible that food and microbiota can modify the outcome of the densovirus infection, either by directly competing for binding the PM, or indirectly by modulating the composition of the PM.",

Groundbreaking articles have shown the role of microbiota polysaccharides including GlcNAc, on the infectivity and thermostability of picornaviruses [64] [65] [66] , whose capsid share structural similarity with parvoviruses [25] . It is tempting to speculate that densovirus \"stickiness\" can similarly impact their transmission, which might participate to their success if only among arthropods that occupy extremely diversified ecosystems [67] . Such consideration could also apply to parvoviruses going through faecal-oral route and environmental contamination [58, 68] . More generally, stickiness is a major issue for most viruses to and mathematical models have been applied to influenza. They predict that a maximum stickiness favors a maximum fitness [69] . However, trade-off probably exists in biological systems with an optimal \"stickiness\" that must be found to infect and leave a host for transmission.",
