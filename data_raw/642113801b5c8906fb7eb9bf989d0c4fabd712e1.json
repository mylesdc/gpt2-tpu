Following zoonotic transmission, the pathogen may already have, or may acquire, the ability to transmit from human to human. With infections such as Lassa fever (LF), an often fatal, rodent-borne, hemorrhagic fever common in areas of West Africa, rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-rodent transmission patterns are possible. Indeed, large hospital-related outbreaks have been reported. Estimating the proportion of transmission due to human-tohuman routes and related patterns (e.g. existence of super-spreaders), in these scenarios is challenging, but essential for planned interventions.",

The analyses show that almost 20% of the cases at KGH are secondary cases arising from human-to-human transmission. However, we found much of this transmission is associated with a disproportionally large impact of a few individuals ('super-spreaders'), as we found only 5% of human cases result in an effective reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases per infectious case) w1, with a maximum value up to 12.",

Our work highlights several neglected topics in LF research, the occurrence and nature of super-spreading events and aspects of social behavior in transmission and detection.",

Estimating the relative contribution of each is of fundamental importance for the planning and implementation of appropriate infection control and preventive measures. This can be an extremely difficult task if humans and animals share the same physical space, and/or if experimentation (e.g. to quantify the probability of animal-to-animal transmission) is subjected to serious limitations. This is the case of Lassa fever (LF), a rodentborne disease endemic in West Africa. Despite its clear zoonotic origin, there are strong arguments, listed below, to hypothesize that a significant proportion of the burden of LF in humans arises from human-to-human transmission. The aim of this work is to test whether or not patterns in the epidemic curve describing the cases of LF observed in Sierra Leone [1] , are compatible with patterns observed in chains of pure human-to-human transmission recorded in nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks [2, 3] .",

The disease was first recognized in the village of Lassa, Nigeria in 1969, which caused the death of two missionarynurses and the grave illness of a third [4] . However, cases consistent with LF from the eastern part of Sierra Leone can be traced back to 1956 [5] . Since the identification of LASV, humanto-human transmission has been documented in several nosocomial outbreaks (e.g. [2, 3] and also [6] for a review), leading to an initial perception that the virus was both highly contagious and virulent [4] ; this resulted in stringent requirements for containment of the patients [7] . Soon after, its zoonotic origin was recognized and Mastomys natalensis, one of the most common African rodents, was identified as the reservoir of the virus [8] . The risk of nosocomial transmission was shown to be dramatically reduced by using simple barrier nursing method [7, [9] [10] [11] , suggesting that the risk of human-to-human transmission might be negligible.",

Further cases of extra-hospital transmission within a single family (five from the same family, EE, EE2, SE, TI, and FT who likely initiated the chain) were reported, here and throughout we refer to this chain as an 'extra-nosocomial' chain. Haas et al. [14] investigated secondary transmission after an imported case of LF into Europe and found that one of 149 contacts that were tested serologically, a physician who examined the patient on day 9 of illness, had become infected. The authors concluded that, during the initial phase of symptomatic LF the risk of transmission is low, but it may increase with progression of disease and increasing viral excretion. Emond et al. [15] described a case of LF in the UK in which the virus was isolated from urine 16 days after the acute phase had ended, despite not being detected earlier. The virus may also be found in pharyngeal secretions for 3{4 weeks after the onset of clinical signs [16] . In an experimental model, Stephenson et al. [17] showed the ability to infect guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys with LASV via the respiratory route and Peters et al. [18] demonstrated fatal LASV transmission to monkeys through being held in the same room for 12 days with inoculated rodents. Sagripanti et al. [19] , in a dark room at ambient laboratory temperatures controlled between 20 0 C and 25 0 C and 30{40% relative humidity, showed that the time required for a 90% reduction in viral load of LASV in glass containers was w58 hours and was 9:7 days for a 99:99% relative humidity. Also, Kern\u00e9is et al. [20] identified that risk factors for positive seroconversion to LASV included either having received a medical injection, or having lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage, in the previous twelve months. No factors related to contact with rodents were identified. Similarly, McCormick et al. [21] reported a lack of correlation between human LASV-specific IgG prevalence and either the level of domestic infestation by Mastomys, or the presence of LASV infection in Mastomys. These observations, taken together, suggest that a significant (if perhaps variable) proportion of the burden of LF might be associated with human-to-human transmission.",

The current Ebola outbreak has emphasised further the need for targeted biosecure measures which distinguish managing hemorrhagic fever cases and outbreaks from preventing spillover from reservoirs. This issue has not previously been fully addressed for Lassa Fever. Traditional approaches, such as cluster analysis, to distinguish human-tohuman transmission from pure zoonotic transmission cannot be employed here due to the potential of clustering of infection in households from common exposure to infected rodents in addition to clustering arising from infected people. We overcome this problem by adapting other approaches [29, 30] , and using data from nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks and hospitalized patients in Kenema Governmental Hospital (KGH), Sierra Leone [1] . We use these data to provide an estimation of the contribution of human-to-human transmission to the Lassa fever occurrence in endemic areas and to provide a more-robust assessment of the risk of secondary spread from index cases.",

Then, we looked at people hospitalized with the disease in Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone (KGH), who could have been infected either by rodents or humans. We asked, what should the proportion of patients be who get infected by humans, assuming the statistical patterns observed in the human-to-human chains are the same in both instances? We found that around 20% of patients with Lassa fever in KGH probably acquired the disease from another person. In addition, the patterns of disease in people suggest that these 20% of cases are probably initiated by only a small number of infected people (who could be thought of as super-spreaders). These considerations justify the choice of comparing the data from KGH with the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in Jos, while the appropriateness of comparing the KGH data with the nosocomial cases in the Jos outbreak is one of the hypothesis being tested in the current work.",

It is important to note that t nm , and thus q ij , is explicitly timedependent, (Fig. 1.D) . The index k represents all possible cases within a nosocomial outbreak. Important underlying assumptions are: each event can independently start a new chain of human-to-human transmission, beginning of infectiousness coincides with the onset of symptoms, and infections occur with equal probability at any time during the interval t nm . Accordingly, the sum R Nos j (t j )~P i q ij over all cases i, represents the individual effective reproduction number for case j at the time t j when the case arises. If multiple cases are observed at the same time t j , then R Nos j (t j ) is averaged appropriately. To increase the sample size and improve the estimation, the duration of the symptoms of LF and the period spent at the hospital associated with each patient were randomly rearranged among the 23 cases ( Fig. 1.C) , then the ensemble average individual effective reproduction number was calculated based on 100 of these permutations. The network of contacts was kept the same. The identical approach was used to calculate the effective reproduction number, R ExtraNos j (t j ), for the extra-nosocomial situation, with the network of contacts restricted to the family TI, EE, EE2, SE and FT who presumably initiated the chain. We use the notation The correctness of the approach was corroborated by performing the same analysis but by imposing that each case is exposed only to the index case. For the situation in Jos, the individual reproduction numbers were zero for all cases except for TS which results in 15, i.e. the only cases exposed to TS and marked with a thin red line in Fig. 1 .",

Therefore we made a conservative choice of T~62 days which corresponds to the maximum duration of the Jos outbreak (here the last day corresponds to when case SE recovered). Any shorter choice of the duration T ExtraNos , will result in a larger value of the proportion Q (for instance if the typical duration of the outbreak is 50 days, i.e. including while TS was at the hospital, we found that Q&26% instead of &20% while the estimates based on the intersection with the 25 th -percentile and 75 th -percentile were &19% and &38% respectively rather than &15% and &30%), which reinforces the key message of this current work that a significant proportion of cases of LF arises from human-to-human transmission.",

The daily mean effective reproduction numbers, R, observed in the nosocomial outbreaks (only human-to-human transmission) are much larger, and thus incompatible, with the ones estimated from the data from KGH, even if we assume 100% human-to-human transmission. If we regard the extra-nosocomial cases observed in the Jos outbreak as representative of disease transmission in an endemic area, then a significant proportion of LF cases (&20%) arise from human-to-human transmission. A significant proportion of these secondary cases, however, are attributable to a few events with disproportionately large effective reproduction numbers: super-spreading events. In general, the distributions of the individual reproductive number, R Ind , and the average number of cases during an epidemic, R, exhibits a tail heavier than the exponential or Poisson distributions, here used as benchmarks for thin-tailed distributions. This reveal over-dispersion indicating the presence of super-spreading events.",

Any future assessment of the associated risk of LF and formulation of patient containment guidelines [13] , therefore, should take into account the fat-tail nature of the underlying distribution of individual reproduction number.",

The underlying reasons for superspreading are not fully understood, but include amount of pathogen excreted, length of the infectious period, social behavior and environmental factors. Understanding the mechanisms of super-spreaders in LF requires an understanding of all of these factors, but transmission of LASV is not well characterized. In the Jos outbreak, Carey et al. [2] speculated that the severe pulmonary involvement of the index case and the location of her bed could cause airborne spread of virus to the rest of the ward. The long persistence of viruria, even during the recovery period, could facilitate transmission of LASV to other people or to the rodent reservoir host, especially in rural settlements in areas of West Africa where sanitary facilities are limited. Participatory modeling and ethnographic research [53] would be an invaluable tool to assess the variety of practices and settings in which people come into contact with each other's urine and other body fluids, perceptions of risk, and approaches to hygiene. Apart the work of Stephenson et al. [17] and Peter et al. [18] , we are not aware of specific experiments aimed to test routes of LASV transmission. Studies on environmental contamination are also required to explore if human-to-rodent transmission is important for the maintenance or spread of LASV infection [6] .",

This is probably reasonable, but public health measures may impact on this in the future. The predictions are based on the assumption of uniform mixing, i.e. each case from KGH is potentially in contact with each other case. Although this is a reasonable assumption, considering the large human mobility in Sierra Leone, for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits and events [54] , it will overestimate R. In addition, there is likely to be incomplete reporting which will underestimate R. Although the two factors might compensate for each other, if KGH could reduce reporting bias and increase information on network contacts, it would be highly beneficial to studies such as this, especially as human mobility and overcrowding has been associated with an amplification of LF [31] . This represents a further area where participatory modeling/ethnographic research is much needed to gather information on actual patterns of mobility and social networking, and hence potential contact patterns.",

In the current context, Kern\u00e9is et al. [20] provided detailed information on prevalence and risk factors of Lassa (e.g. history of collecting, cutting and eating rats) stratified by age. In addition, the age distribution from KGH is also available. These data could be combined together to build a matrix of transmission rates among age-groups (as done in [55, 56] ) and between rodents and each age-group with values based on the findings of Kern\u00e9is et al. [20] . For the KGH data, the difference in time of onset of symptoms was approximated here with the difference in time of visit/referral to the hospital following disease onset. This assumption can be an important source of error as patterns of health seeking behavior might vary largely among the Sierra Leonean population. For example, a particular group of the population might favor traditional medicine and approach institutional health care only at a late stage of the disease. Patients from rural areas might be subjected to further delay due to poor infrastructure. Health seeking behavior is perhaps one the most fruitful areas where participatory modeling and ethnographic research have been successfully employed and should be considered in the present context. The estimations here are based on the assumption that probability of cross-species transmission occurs at random throughout outbreaks, although these events are expected to be strongly driven by a multitude of interacting causes, including ecological (e.g. seasonality in the abundance of the reservoir), epidemiological (e.g. seasonality in the prevalence of the pathogen), genetic variation (e.g. broad set of pathogen life histories) and socio-economic (e.g. the practice of burning the fields after harvesting affecting the ecology and dispersal patterns of M. natalensis) factors.",
