As a result of an international mandate for better quality animals 2 , the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued guidelines for animal housing and husbandry in 1962 3 . Since that time a great deal of attention has been paid to standardizing facilities, light/day cycles, diets, techniques and equipment 4 . The overall strategy has been to breed animals free of infectious agents, from germ-free stock or caesarean aseptic techniques, then expose the colony to an environment free of selected infectious pathogens (not all) that would otherwise interfere with research objectives 2, 4 . Today, most animal husbandry facilities adopt this specific-pathogen free (SPF) approach and provide certification that a colony or breeding pair is free from common infectious agents that a species is customarily exposed to in the wild. This approach also has additional benefits of cost-saving and ethical benchmarks as it reduces the number of animals used within individual studies. It also aims to improve standardization of animals and the scale of reproducibility (and replicability) among different laboratories around the world working on similar problems and preclinical questions 1, 4, 5 .",

Since pulse pressure depends largely on stroke volume and arterial stiffness 15 , our data suggest that the significantly lower pulse pressure in SPF rats was the result of a lower stroke volume and impaired left ventricular-arterial coupling relationship. This was further supported by a prolonged QTc interval in SPF animals (Table 1) . A prolonged QTc in animal models and humans have been associated with lower stroke volume, compromised left ventricular function and increased mortality 16, 17 . Our interpretation of a failing cardiovascular system in SPF animals was further supported by the presence of ventricular arrhythmias (Table 1, Fig. 2a,b) , and a mild cardiomyopathy indicated from a histopathological multifocal myofiber degeneration, replacement fibrosis and macrophage infiltration (data not shown). Blood pressure and heart rate oscillations (timings of peaks and valleys) were similar between SPF and conventional animals (Fig. 1a,b) , indicating there was little or no differences in the baroreflex input contributions to blood pressure regulation in the two colonies 18 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Assessment of coagulation properties also revealed the presence of a significant whole blood hyperfibrinolysis in SPF compared to conventional rats. Hyperfibrinolysis is a common bleeding phenotype following severe traumatic injury, shock or major surgery, and believed to be initiated by activation of protein C on the endothelium-thrombomodulin-thrombin complex [19] [20] [21] . However, in our study, SPF animals showed hyperfibrinolysis after minor surgical cut-downs and femoral artery cannulations and instrumentation, a time when baseline data is normally collected prior to experiment. Based on hemodynamic and coagulation status, we conclude that SPF animals possessed a lower physiological reserve to stress of surgery than conventional rats. The 1.4-to 2.7-fold higher baseline counts of white blood cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelet counts, and lower hemoglobin levels, compared to the blood of conventional rats are suggestive of an activated immune system and/or low-grade systemic inflammation. However, when we reverted back to using www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ animals from the conventional facility, a normal hematological profile was restored. Our study supports the work of Beura and colleagues who reported that their 'standard' SPF mice were infection-prone as a result of an immature immune system, which was reversed when wild mice were introduced into the colony 6 . They traced the anomaly to alterations in the animal's gut microbiome.",

Thus, the presence of Proteus bacteria may have contributed to the SPF rats' hematological profile and reduced stress response. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of effects of other infectious agents that were not investigated (see Table 3 ).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) bred in the conventional James Cook University Breeding Colony were housed in open top caging in a 14-10 hr light-dark cycle with free access to standard rat chow (Norco rural stock) and water ad libitum. Cages were polypropylene with high-top wire mesh cage tops (1640 cm 2 floor space).

These experiments were carried out before the transition to SPF animals. SPF sprague dawley colony. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) bred in the specific-pathogen free (SPF) Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine (AITHM) Small Animal Facility were maintained in individually ventilated double decker Tecniplast cages (1862 cm 2 floor space) in a 14-10 hr light-dark cycle and fed irradiated rat cubes from Speciality Feeds (Glen Forrest, Western Australia). Nutritional content of feed for both colonies was equivalent and exceeded National Research Council (NRC) guidelines. All bedding and materials for environmental enrichment (shredded paper, tubes, chew blocks, tissues) and for nesting were identical to those used in the Conventional colony with the exception of being autoclaved before use. The AITHM Small Animal Facility has strict containment procedures.Animal acclimation. Seven days prior to surgery, animals from both facilities were transferred to the Medical Research Laboratory and housed in individually ventilated double decker Tecniplast cages containing non-sterilised Andersons Bed-o'Cobs \u00ae \u00bc\" corncob bedding with Aspen chew blocks, tunnels and shredded paper to allow for enrichment and natural behaviours.",
