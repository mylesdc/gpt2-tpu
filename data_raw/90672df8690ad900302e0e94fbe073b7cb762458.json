            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis has caused huge economic losses in the poultry industry. Previous studies have reported that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection can produce cytopathic effects (CPE) and apoptosis in some mammalian cells and primary cells. However, there is little research on IBV-induced immune cell apoptosis. In this study, chicken macrophage HD11 cells were established as a cellular model that is permissive to IBV infection. Then, IBV-induced apoptosis was observed through a cell viability assay, morphological changes, and flow cytometry. The activity of caspases, the inhibitory efficacy of caspase-inhibitors and the expression of apoptotic genes further suggested the activation of apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Additionally, ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) pretreated HD11 cells blocked IBV from entering cells and inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis. UV-inactivated IBV also lost the ability of apoptosis induction. IBV replication was increased by blocking caspase activation. This study presents a chicken macrophage cell line that will enable further analysis of IBV infection and offers novel insights into the mechanisms of IBV-induced apoptosis in immune cells.",

IBV is a member of the family Coronaviridae and genus Coronavirus. It is a single stranded positive sense, enveloped RNA virus 27-32 kb in length [1, 2] . Like some other members of the coronavirus family, IBV mainly causes upper-respiratory tract disease. IBV is characterized by nephritis, proventriculitis and reduction in both laying rate and egg quality in infected chickens [3] . Vaccination is an effective prevention measure, but IBV's ability to mutate has decreased vaccine protection [4] [5] [6] . In order to develop better prevention and control measures, the interactions between host and IBV needs to be better studied. Almost all wild-type IBV strains are only able to proliferate in embryonated chicken eggs or primary chicken embryo kidney cells. The Beaudette strains were used previously to study the resistance of IBV to the antiviral state induced by type I interferon (IFN) [7] , induction of apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress in Vero cells by IBV infection [8] and activate autophagy by IBV nonstructural protein (NSP) 6 [9] . However, there have been limited studies of the interactions between IBV infection and immune cell apoptosis. Here, the Beaudette strain was used to study the mechanism of IBV infection.",

The activation of caspases (a family of cysteine protease) is a significant regulatory event in the apoptosis process [11] . Caspase cascades are triggered by both extrinsic and intrinsic signals to mediate the cell apoptosis [12] . The relationship between cell apoptosis and virus infection is complex. Cell apoptosis induced by virus may cause tissue damage, especially in the immune and nervous systems, suggesting that apoptosis is a pathogenic mechanism in virus-induced disease. At the same time, apoptosis of infected cells can directly interfere with viral replication, and immune cells can engulf apoptotic cells to prevent inflammation [13, 14] .",

However, there is limited information about the apoptosis signaling pathways induced by IBV infection in immune cells. Some studies indicated that IBV can transform certain elements of the innate immune system to promote secondary bacterial infections, and macrophages, as an important component of the innate immune system, may play a role in this process [17] . A nephropathogenic IBV strain (B1648) can productively replicate in blood monocytic cells, and the infected cells may act as carrier cells to play a crucial role in cell-associated viremia and the dissemination of virus to the internal organs [18] . Some viruses have been shown to induce apoptosis in macrophage, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [19] , Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [20] and influenza virus [21] . Therefore, additional study is required to investigate the functional roles of macrophages in IBV infection to help understand the mechanistic details of immune responses during virus infections [22] .",

The data revealed that cell viability was significantly increased by the specific inhibition of caspase-3, -8, and -9 ( Figure 3B ). To confirm the function of caspase-8 and caspase-9 to activate caspase-3, the inhibitory efficacy of the caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibitors on caspase-3 activity was also determined. When cells were pretreated with the caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibitor, the activity of caspase-3 was significantly decreased in cells, and more significantly decreased when the two inhibitors were added together ( Figure 3C ).

IBV Holte and Beaudette-42 strains can proliferate in the BHK-21 cell line [32] , and the Beaudette strain of embryo-culture IBV has adapted to Vero cells [33] . However, previous studies of chicken immune cells and the pathogenesis of IBV focused on primary immune cells separated from the blood or spleen [18, 34] . In this study, HD11 cells, a chicken macrophage cell line, were shown to be susceptible to IBV Beaudette. Additionally, the IBV Beaudette-infected cells produced infectious virus progeny with a high virus titer. Morphological assessment of the cells during IBV Beaudette infection showed that CPE can be observed after 24 h.p.i. The virus growth kinetics for HD11 cells also showed peak viral titers at 36 h.p.i. Immunofluorescence was used to identify and analyze virus infection, and strong fluorescence signals were observed in the IBV Beaudette-infected cells. Based on these results, the chicken macrophage HD11 cells will serve as an essential tool for future studies of IBV infection.",

Infection with coronavirus induced apoptosis in various cell types. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells was dependent on viral replication [31] . Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway in PK-15 cells [35] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins can induce apoptosis in HPF cells [36] . According to previous studies, apoptosis occurs in response to IBV infection in Vero cells, DF1 cells and chicken embryo kidney cells [16, 37] . This study is the first demonstration that IBV induces apoptosis in chicken macrophage HD11 cells. The IBV Beaudette-infected HD11 cells exhibited typical characteristics of apoptosis including the condensation of the cell nucleus, reduction of cell viability, and an increased rate of apoptotic cells.",

            "text": "Caspases are a family of cysteine-catalyzed proteases that cleave aspartic acids. The triggering of caspase cascades plays indispensable roles in apoptosis and can be induced by many viruses. There are two major signaling pathways that contribute to caspase activation: death receptor and mitochondrial pathways [38] . Some viruses have exhibited cell apoptosis that is mediated by Fas/FasL signaling as a reaction to viral infection, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) [39] and dengue virus (DENV) [40] . Cell apoptosis can be induced by some viruses by regulating the levels of Bcl-2 family members, such as SARS coronavirus [41] and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [42] . Our results showed that the activation of caspase-8 in IBV Beaudette-infected cells was regulated by Fas and FasL. The results also showed that activation of caspase-9 in IBV Beaudette-infected cells was regulated by decreased expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax. The caspase-3 activation and virus-induced apoptosis might be triggered through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In most cases, cell apoptosis induced by virus is a process of interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The activation of caspase-8 was inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK, and the activation of caspase-9 was not completely eliminating by blocking caspase-8 activity, suggesting that the activation of caspase-8 is not the only pathway to activate caspase-9, requiring further research. IBV are known to induce apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathway [15] and intrinsic-dependent pathway regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins [16] in Vero cells. In this study, these two pathways were demonstrated that play an important role in IBV Beaudette-infected HD11 cells. Additionally, this is the first report that the extrinsic pathway regulated by Fas/FasL was activated in IBV-induced apoptosis. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms by which IBV activates the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways will help to better understand the pathogenic properties of epidemic IBV strains in the host.",

Some other viruses can induce apoptosis without viral replication, such as vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus [44, 45] . Here, infection with UV-inactivated IBV Beaudette or treatment of HD11 cells with NH 4 Cl reduced virus apoptosis induction, indicating that IBV Beaudette -induced apoptosis in HD11 cells depends on viral replication. This finding is similar to that of a previous study showing that UV-inactivated IBV lost the capacity to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells [16] . We tested whether caspase activation is needed for IBV replication in cells. The finding revealed that treatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor can increase the virus titer in IBV Beaudette-infected cells, suggesting that the caspase inhibitor might increase the survival time of cells to promote replication. From a therapeutic standpoint, available drugs controlling apoptosis could be used to limit IBV spreading [46] .",

Some viruses have evolved strategies to induce apoptosis to enhance the production of virus progeny and promote dissemination to neighboring cells with limited host immune/inflammatory responses. The presence of apoptotic cells may also lead to the mobilization and initiation of innate immune defenses [47] . Previous studies have shown that virus-induced apoptosis of macrophage has an important impact on virus infection. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) stimulates anti-apoptotic pathways in macrophages early in infection, and these PRRSV-infected macrophages die by apoptosis late in infection [48] . CHIKV infection induces apoptosis and enhances expression of major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) and co-stimulatory molecules and interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 production in macrophages [20] . However, little is known about IBV-induced immune cell apoptosis. It has been reported that phagocytic cells may play a crucial role in dissemination of virus to the blood circulation and internal organs. Therefore, establishment of this macrophage system of IBV Beaudette infection and determination of the apoptotic mechanism might be proof of principle for IBV infection in the host.",
