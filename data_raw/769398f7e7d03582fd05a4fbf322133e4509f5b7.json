In fact, EU legislation on biological agents and genetically modified microorganisms is often not specific enough to ensure harmonization leading to difficulties in implementation for most laboratories. In the same way, biosecurity is a relatively new concept and a few EU Member States are known to have introduced national laboratory biosecurity legislation. In France, recent regulations have reinforced biosafety/biosecurity in containment level 3 (CL-3) laboratories but they concern a specific list of pathogens with no correlation in other European Members States. The objective of this review was to summarize European biosafety/biosecurity measures concerning CL-3 facilities focusing on French specificities. Essential requirements needed to preserve efficient biosafety measures when manipulating risk group 3 biological agents are highlighted. In addition, International, European and French standards related to containment laboratory planning, operation or biosafety equipment are described to clarify optimal biosafety and biosecurity requirements.",

As a direct consequence, European labo ratories in which infectious microorganisms are manipulated were confronted to a drastic increase in biosafety/biosecurity regulations. Useful information is available in websites of the agencies in charge of specific aspects, however, its diversity led to difficulties to comply with all these rules. Moreover, regulations can be different in European Union (EU) Member State countries and despite efforts of national agencies to place online specific information, European laboratories working with infectious pathogens are confronted to a large number of complex rules and regulations.",

Byers and Harding reported that 85% of LAI were caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coxiella burnetii, hantaviruses, arboviruses, hepatitis B and C viruses, Brucella spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. (7) . In the USA, from 2004 to 2010, only 11 LAIs were reported to CDC for microorganisms listed as Biological Select Agents and Toxins (8): six cases due to Brucella spp., four cases due to Francisella tularensis, and one case due to Coccidioides immitis/ posadasii (9) . Although there is no harmonized system for the reporting of laboratory incidents and accidents at the EU level, few LAIs have been described in European laboratories during the last decade highlighting a drastic reduction of these accidents in CL3 laboratories (5) . Doubtless, current practices have also minimized worker's pathogen exposition and improvements in containment equipment, engineering controls, and safety train ing contributed greatly to this reduction.",

RGs reflect the risk for laboratory workers and for the community; they relate but do not equate with the confinement level in which pathogens must be manipulated (2) . When a specific RG is attributed to a given microorganism, it must be manipulated in laboratory enforcing the same containment level (CL). CL defines a set of biocon tainment measures to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility. There are four CLs: CL1 to CL4 (13) . Poliovirus (PV) is a typical example of biorisk management: in 2015, a revised edition of the WHO Global Action Plan (GAP) to minimize \"PV facilityassociated risks after typespecific eradi cation of wild PVs and sequential cessation of oral PV vaccine use (GAPIII)\" was implemented (14, 15) . Containment of PVs, as laid out in GAPIII, is taking place in three phases linked to global milestones in polio eradication. Current (Phase 1) activities are focused on containment of type 2 wild PV or vaccinederived PV, as well as on preparation for containment of vaccine PVs of type 2 (OPV/Sabin2). In 2016, the European Region has completed the first step, requiring Member States to (i) provide national inven tories of all facilities hosting wild PVs (WPVs) and (ii) destroy all unneeded WPV2 materials or designate a PV essential facility (PEF) and accordingly a national authority for containment tasked with national certification of the PEF.",

From 2001, France has implemented a regulation system to register facilities possess ing substances from the list of the microorganisms and toxins (MOTs). The scope of the legislation was the control of MOTs use which was likely to be a public health risk and the new regulatory framework was applicable to all French laboratories involved in any operation using MOTs for diagnostic, research, development, or teaching purposes. The list mentions highrisk agents/toxins that have been determined to have potential for use as bioweap ons and were subject to more drastic measures concerning their acquisition and handling (French Decree of June 30, 2010) . It is important to specify that this list included genetic material (DNA or RNA) less than 500 nucleotides in length or toxins, protein toxin fragments containing fewer than 167 amino acids. The extension of such regulation concerning noninfectious materials is unique to France. These measures were enforced in French academic laboratories with an update list of pathogens classified as MOT in the order of April 30, 2012 (French Order of April 30, 2012) . Every year, laboratories have to report to the Agence national de Securit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00e9 (ANSM, the French Biosafety/Biosecurity Agency) an inventory of MOT samples. Legal MOT obligations led to additional difficulties when animal experiments are planned with these pathogens knowing that corresponding A3facility (for \"Animal facilitylevel 3\") and biologists have to follow the same regulations. Moreover, French laboratories using MOT pathogens were also identified as ZRR (for \"Zone \u00e0 R\u00e9gime Restrictif \"; restricted access area) area. This ZRR classification was based in the order of July 3, 2012, which defined four risks for the nation (R1-R4): (i) the risk of violation of economic interests (R1); (ii) the risk of abuses of defense capabilities (R2); (iii) the risk of proliferation (R3); and (iv) the risk of terrorism (R4). Under institutional supervision, the \"director of such ZRR laboratories (which may be subject to crimi nal sanction for not complying with the law and instructions) must set up the monitoring of any person who wishes to join a research team and therefore work inside the research unit\" (16).",

This standard is DIN 1946-1947 \"Ventilation and air conditioning-Part 7: Ventilation systems in laboratories\" and includes a recommendation but not a require ment for minimum lab ventilation of 25 m 3 /h/m 2 . This minimum ventilation flow recommendation corresponds to about 9.1 air change hour (ACH) for a 9foot ceiling or an 8.2 ACH rate for a 10foot ceiling space. Based on risk assessment and general practices, air change rates are often set to a single value between 6 and 12 ACH for most CL3 laboratories. Ventilation rates in animal facilities usually range 10-15 ACH. The laboratory qual ity stepwise implementation tool (WHO, 2015) recommended a minimum of six ACH for CL3 facilities. This minimum air flow shall be maintained permanently, whether the laboratory is used for experiments or not. Ventilation rates were established not only for efficient prevention of airborne contamination but also for odor control in the laboratory air space. Airflow in CL3 facilities shall be designed to move from \"clean\" areas toward the biocontainment space. A negative pressure differential of 12.5 Pa (0.05 in w.g.) must be maintained between each pressure zone following the laboratory quality stepwise implementation tool (WHO, 2015) or US recommendations (19) . For CL3 laborato ries containing multiple zones, greater negative pressure must be established in highrisk rooms. For ensuring the pressure differ ential in all containment rooms, specific monitoring and control devices shall be provided as well as visual readout, alarm devices at the entrance of the containment space, in anterooms, or at entrance of the individual rooms within the containment suite. In fact, multiple possible designs exist for CL3 laboratories (12, 20) , which facilities should be verified at least annually with the minimum facility verification requirements described in Table 1 . One of the common essential features of CL3 laboratory includes proper procedures for disposal of biomedical waste and even if an autoclave facility is recommended, biohazardous waste and liquid effluents should also be decontaminated using only validated chemical treatments.",

            "text": "In 2010, the European IRMM issued a guide to promote common technical specifications for the supply, installation, and maintenance of steam sterilization autoclaves in CL3 and CL2 laboratories. 5 Basically, in the CL3 laboratory suite, the autoclave should be a steam sterilization one with external steam supply and any item, device, or solution was considered to be sterile when it was completely free of all living microorganisms and viruses. From an operational standpoint, a sterilization procedure cannot be categorically defined and the optimal cycle parameters for steam sterilization, depended on at least four factors such as size/type load, time and throughput constraints, or steam source. Rather, the procedure was defined to reach a potential surviving of microorganism less than one in one million (10 6 ) at the end of the process. However, due to the absence of pertinent standards, biological indicators (BIs) were considered the \"gold standard\" of load sterilization monitoring. BIs were widely recommended as the preferred device for monitoring and releasing loads. Geobacillus stearothermophilus (considered as the most resistant microorganism) was commonly used to validated the sterilization process (spore population reduction up to 4/6 log10 depending upon the laboratory biorisk internal analysis). ISO 14161:2009 provides guidance for BIs efficient utilization in sterilization procedures. When using a CL3 autoclave it is imperative that pathogens do not escape through the autoclave doors-either via poorly designed gaskets or by inadvertently opening the doors simultaneously. Materials and bags should be packed specifically in the chamber to allow easy steam penetration and air removal. Moreover, the autoclave shall be configured to disinfect complex and various waste loads (solids, porous goods, and liquids). CL3 autoclaves should be carefully specified and equipped with the proper door gaskets and door safety mechanisms. Moreover, all CL3 autoclaves should be equipped with a biological sealing flange that provided separation and a positive seal between the hazardous side (contained side) and safe side (noncontained side), which is imperative for the safety of personnel. As CL3 facilities work with microbes that may pose serious health risks, the air/steam effluent had also to be contained, filtered, or decon taminated prior to exhausting into the environment.",

For example, some of the following elements should be budget:",

In 1997 and 1998, the law was modified to increase the classification of certain pathogens that could constitute a bioter rorism threat. Since 2008, the use of genetically modified organ isms (GMOs) in contained spaces for research and educational purposes is subject to prior authorization from the French min istry in charge of research. The ministry must receive the opinion of the French HCB before giving its authorization. Thus, a GMO classification was created in the framework of Directive 2009/41/ EC. This list of pathogens was based on previously classification with some updates and modifications in relation to the risks that they present and applying appropriate physical, biological, and chemical containment measures. In fact, some pathogens were classified differently when genetically modified and this lack of harmonization remains unclear (16) .",

Moreover, since the French Decree of June 30, 2010, specific measures for RG3 agents classified as MOTs were established under the control of ANSM (laboratories conception, biosafety, and biosecurity practices). Although these regulations have improved biolo gists, population, and environmental protection, they also led to difficulties for many CL3 laboratories in relation with a large increase in the administrative burden. Moreover, implementation of these new regulations was costly, timeconsuming, and gener ates disparities between CL3 laboratories working or not with MOTs, since the latter are not subject to systematic control or inspections. All operations involving MOTs, including produc tion, manufacture, transport, import, export, retention, supply, sale, purchase, and use are regulated (33) . It was also important to note that French laboratories working on MOTs had to validate their surface or airborne surface disinfection processes to follow ANSM requirements. Moreover, a CL3 laboratory using RG3 genetically modified organism needs to obtain a license for their manipulations. This license was granted after an evaluation by the French HCB and must be registered by the police for a validity period of 5 years.",

However, progressively, these rules have become more and more complex for people designing or managing CL3. Moreover, a lack of harmonization of practical guidance ant the develop ment of specific national regulations based on EU Directives (27) led to difficulties in their implementations. French CL3 labora tories were good examples as they were recently impacted and confronted to exhaustive regulations concerning MOTs without international harmonization. The complexity of the situation to integrate and comply with all these new regulations is not only time and costconsuming for laboratories but it can also be counterproductive face to international concurrence. At the same time, there was a growing need to manipulate pathogenic MOTs in academic laboratories for fundamental research purposes, diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines development. However, due to a nonharmonization concerning CL3 facilities management (design, construction, conformity, and maintenance), it was sometimes difficult for European professional to have a clear and concise overview of essential aspects to consider. This limitation could be problematic not only for new CL3 laboratories con ception (and future substantial cost in case of nonconformity) but also in terms of biosafety and biosecurity if the referential was unclear. Since many years, CL3 facilities were yet described on international literature but generally these works focused on partial or general considerations with no detailed and practical information. Based on French specificities but also on essential technical aspects and EU Directives, this review resumes biosafety/biosecurity measures concerning CL3 facilities. Essential CL3 requirements and French/European standards have been compiled to manipulated safely risk group 3 biological agents in compliance with the legislation. Clarification of optimal biosafety and biosecurity requirements should be useful to any laboratories working with RG3 biological agents in France but also in Europe.",

Although National and EU classifications are globally congruent, there are still discrepancies that render the situation quite complex.
