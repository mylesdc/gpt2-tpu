In addition, an individual infected with a deadly pathogen can transmit the pathogen at a high human density place or event. Some highly contagious and fatal biological agents that are considered as bio-terror agents include Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, small pox, or Marburg viruses and other emerging pathogens (Pohanka and Kuca, 2010; Menrath et al., 2014) .",

Outbreaks including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 (Christian et al., 2004 , continuously evolving influenza virus strains (Khanna et al., 2008) and recent infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Hartl, 2013 ) underscore that such a natural threat is a real possibility. Early detection of the pathogen can result in prompt intervention and treatment of exposed individuals as well as confine the secondary spread. Because of the high global mobility of people, the failure to detect an intentional or natural outbreak of a contagious disease could result in its rapid spread with catastrophic consequences. In order to effectively safeguard against such threats, it is critical to continuously monitor the air for the presence of pathogenic biological agents, particularly at high risk events or places such as airports, malls, subway stations, cruise ships, aircraft, theaters, stadiums, or schools. Such an approach requires an advanced system that can continuously sample the ambient air for pathogen detection.",

For testing, we aerosolized an innocuous replicationdefective bovine adenovirus serotype 3 (BAdV3) in a controlled laboratory environment.

Each sample was run in triplicate. After the run, each PUF was collected from the cartridge, and the nucleic acid was extracted from the virus trapped in the PUF using the DNAzol protocol. The amounts of the recovered nucleic acid were quantitated by qPCR assay. The ASAP biosampler efficiently collected and trapped viral aerosols from the air.

There was no crosscontamination from one PUF to another; the negative PUF in a cartridge remained negative after each run. Subsequently, to mimic conditions similar to a normal work environment, the experiment was conducted in a room with a normal ventilation system.

            "text": "Over the last several decades, continuous air sampling coupled with rapid and accurate detection of potential pathogens in bioaerosols has attracted much attention. The ASAP bioaerosol sampler has been tested to sample bacteria and spores (Goransson et al., 2012) or metalliferous airborne particles (Moreno et al., 2015) under field conditions. However, the ASAP sampler had not yet been tested for collection of viral aerosols. In this study we investigated the efficacy of the ASAP bioaerosol sampler to collect and trap surrogate virus aerosols from the air and detect them using suitable assays. We demonstrated that in controlled laboratory conditions, the ASAP sampler can efficiently trap surrogate BAd-E1E3 viral aerosols that can be extracted from the PUFs and identified using qPCR. The purpose of bioaerosol sampling is to detect a biological agent release so that the impact of a biological agent attack can be reduced by executing appropriate responses with minimal delay. However, the conventional time-consuming laboratory methods involving culturing of microorganisms can take days to identify the pathogen. Molecular biology techniques such as qPCR are rapid, specific and sensitive enough to identify the genus, species or strain of the pathogen. These molecular assays can also be multiplexed to monitor more than one bio-threat agent at a time. As qPCR assays are quantitative, they can provide additional valuable information regarding the concentration of pathogens in the ambient air. We successfully detected the bioaerosols containing as low as 2 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies equivalent (5 \u00d7 10 3 p.f.u.) of BAd-E1E3. The technology of airborne pathogen detection is still in the trial stage with no approved device in practical application yet. Unfortunately, there are no set standards for the sensitivity of airborne pathogen detection. However, the detection of surrogate virus, released from a distance of 10 ft (305 cm), and at a concentration as low as 2 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies equivalent (5 \u00d7 10 3 p.f.u.) in a room the size of 972 cubic ft (27.5 cubic meters) is quite sensitive by many standards.",

            "text": "The ASAP sampler is highly portable (32 cm/side; 13.6 kg), quiet in operation and has low energy usage (battery operable). The ASAP system equipment is extremely user friendly and allows changing the default settings of the machine to add attachments such as a GPS, wireless and Ethernet communication, temperature, and wind sensor, video exposure monitoring with regular and infrared cameras to identify anyone with fever who may be a carrier of a pathogen, and realtime sensors for radioactivity. ASAP can be controlled using an external trigger. All of these aspects of the ASAP 2800 system would make it a dynamic and powerful tool in the detection of airborne pathogens. The operation of the sampler can be adjusted depending on the requirement of the facility, for example -1 h for each PUF for a total 8 h run or half an hour per PUF for a 4 h run. Sample analysis can be done once every 4-8 h or more frequently depending on the need of the facility. Once released, the virus-loaded fine bioaerosol particles can remain suspended for hours (Yang et al., 2011) and available for detection by bioaerosol samplers. At the end of each run, the sealed iBASS cartridge can be aseptically removed and immediately analyzed for the presence of any alarming genetic material. The rotating iBASS cartridge can hold as many as eight different sampling PUFs along with a blank and negative control. The option of eight different samples allows the selection of specific times to acquire samples. Since there is no cross contamination between the PUFs in an iBASS cartridge, the sampling at different times can be useful to detect the time period when the airborne pathogen was brought into the area. Standard operating procedures for an ASAP system have already been developed by Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute.",

Additional testing to evaluate its feasibility in real world conditions such as small airports, hospitals, and military installations is recommended for its further development and subsequent use for the detection of real pathogens. This study also presents an ideal surrogate virus that can potentially be used in additional studies investigating viral aerosol sampling and detection. BAd-E1E3 is a DNA virus that is quite stable in the environment. BAdV3 does not cause any harm to humans and to ensure additional safety it has been genetically modified to make it replication defective.",

Different concentrations of BAd-E1E3 virus were aerosolized at different distances from the air inlet of the ASAP System, placed in (B) biosafety cabinet [72 inches (183 cm) \u00d7 24 inches (61 cm) \u00d7 28 inches (71 cm)], or (C) in a room [9 feet (274 cm) \u00d7 10 feet (305 cm) \u00d7 10.8 feet (329 cm)]. The amount of BAd-E1E3 virus trapped on the PUFs was quantified by qPCR and depicted as geometric means.",
