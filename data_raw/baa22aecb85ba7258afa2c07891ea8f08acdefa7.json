An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F 1-micro score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F 1-macro ), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F 1-micro score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Na\u00efve Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F 1-micro = 0.994 and F 1-macro = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts.",

Valid, reliable, and automatic classification of syndromes was an essential component of early computerized epidemic detection systems [6] . When data are structured using standardised codes, such as the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINCH) used in laboratories, the International Classification of Diseases (now on its 10 th revision, ICD-10), or the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMEDH) [7] , syndrome classification can be performed by mapping those codes into syndromes.",

Laboratory submission data have, for example, been incorporated into CDC's BioSense Early Event Detection and Situation Awareness System [19] . Moreover, because there are fewer laboratories than sites of clinical care, the use of laboratory databases can provide more complete records and over larger areas [2] . Besides changing focus to early diagnosis, modern surveillance systems are evolving to complete biosurveillance systems. This term is intended to imply a broadening focus, addressing not only human health but all conditions that may threaten public health, such as a disruption in the food supply, or large social and economic disruptions resulting from outbreaks of diseases in animals [2, 20] . Besides their role in the food supply and agricultural economy, animals could serve as sentinels for the detection of certain zoonotic diseases that may be recognized earlier in animals than in humans [21] .",
