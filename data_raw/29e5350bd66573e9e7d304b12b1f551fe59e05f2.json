            "text": "Prof. Zhu made significant contribution to the development of virology in China and was deemed as one of the pioneer virologists in China. In the early 1970s, Prof. Zhu successfully isolated dozens of viral strains of coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses from nasal discharge and pharyngeal fluid samples from patients with cold (Huang et al., 1979; A group of cold prevention and control of PLA 1975; Zhu 1976) , and investigated the infection rate of coronavirus in population, providing basic foundation for the study of the etiology of respiratory infectious diseases in China. In the early 1980s, Prof. Zhu systematically established virus propagation techniques in tissue culture including a variety of viruses such as vector borne alphavirus and flavivirus Liu et al., 1982) . Then at the beginning of 1990s, he and his colleagues isolated the first Chinese HIV strain from the blood samples of a Chinese patient using co-culture of lymphocyte (Sun et al., 1991) . In addition, Prof. Zhu had tried to utilize the monoclonal antibody technology to the laboratory detection and diagnosis of common viral diseases at the very early stage. These brilliant works lead to numerous publications in scientific journals and textbooks. He also co-edited several keystone monographs, including Virus Names (Science Press, Zhu 1987), Modern clinical virology (People's Military Medical Press, Du et al., 1991) , and Prevention and Control of Common Emerging infectious diseases (Zhejiang University Press, Shao et al., 2005) .",
