Here, we investigate the potential for two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses, Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2), isolated from urine collected under urban bat (Eidolon helvum) roosts in Ghana, West Africa, to infect small laboratory animals. AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e. Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses). To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice. Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice. Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets. Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues. The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier. Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present.",

            "text": "New and emerging viral infections impose a significant burden on human health and on the world economy. The majority of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans today are of animal origin with approximately three quarters arising from wildlife 1 . Bats have been shown to harbour more zoonotic viruses than other mammalian species 2, 3 and are implicated in outbreaks of a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Ebola virus (EboV) RNA and antibodies have been discovered in African fruit bats 4 . The largest human outbreak of EboV occurred in West Africa in 2013-2014, resulting in nearly 30,000 infections and 11,000 deaths and took over a year to contain 5 . SARS coronavirus emerged in China in 2002 and infected over 8000 people causing 774 deaths 6 and the MERS coronavirus continues to infect people and cause death in the Middle East 7 . Bats have since been found to harbour a multitude of coronaviruses closely related to SARS and MERS 8, 9 . Pteropid bats are the reservoir hosts for the deadly henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) 10, 11 . NiV continues to cause fatal encephalitis in humans almost annually in Bangladesh, while HeV has spilled-over into horses in Australia nearly every year since 2004 and has killed four people 12, 13 . Orthoreoviruses have been isolated from bats and humans in Southeast Asia where they have caused flu-like illness in people 14 . Known zoonotic viruses of bat origin continue to be of concern for human and animal health, and active surveillance provides our best option for monitoring these agents as well as identifying novel pathogens of zoonotic potential.",

SosPV was isolated from a wildlife biologist studying bats and rodents in Africa in 2012 and is believed to be the causative agent for a severe flu-like illness and skin rash 16 . Follow up investigations revealed the presence of this virus in the spleen of Rousettus aegyptiacus bats 17 . MenPV first emerged in a piggery in NSW, Australia, in 1997 causing reproductive disease in pigs 18 . Two piggery workers had flu-like illness during the outbreak and were later found to have MenPV neutralising antibodies. Serological evidence of MenPV infection was also found in flying foxes roosting near the piggery and the virus was later isolated from Pteropus alecto urine 18, 19 . TioPV was isolated from pteropid bat urine on Tioman Island in 2001 during the search for the reservoir host of Nipah virus 20 . It was later found that humans on the island had neutralising antibodies to TioPV, although no associated disease has been reported 21 .",

In addition, a survey of human sera collected from Ghana and Tanzania detected AchPV2 neutralising antibodies in three of 442 samples tested, however no neutralising antibodies to AchPV1 were detected in these sera. Two of the antibody positive samples were from healthy adults and one was from a febrile paediatric patient 15 .

            "text": "We investigated the potential of the two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses, AchPV1 and AchPV2, to infect laboratory animals representing three species (ferret, guinea pig and mouse). Seroconversion to both Achimota viruses in ferrets and guinea pigs indicated these animals were susceptible to infection, however mice did not seroconvert to either virus. Due to their body size, mice were given a lower dose of inoculum, and were challenged intranasally, rather than via the oronasal route used for the ferrets and guinea pigs. The difference in volume and inoculation route may account for the lack of seroconversion seen in the mice, however it is probably more likely that this species is resistant to infection. Higher levels of neutralising antibodies were observed in the ferrets and guinea pigs infected with AchPV2 compared to those infected with AchPV1. This result reflected in vitro data where it was observed previously that AchPV2 consistently grows to a higher titre than AchPV1 in vero and PaKi cell lines 15 . Additionally, respiratory tract disease in one of two ferrets given either AchPV1 or AchPV2 was seen in the observational studies, although it remains unclear if this was related to Achimota virus infection or was entirely due to co-infection by an unknown pathogen. AchPV2 was chosen for a time-course study based on two criteria: higher neutralising antibodies observed in ferrets and guinea pigs compared to AchPV1, and previous evidence of human infection (AchPV2 neutralising antibodies). Given more time and resources, it would be worthwhile to do an additional time course study with AchPV1, to further investigate the differences between these two viruses. The AchPV2 time-course studies provided additional evidence that this virus can infect ferrets and guinea pigs and revealed viral replication sites and potential routes of transmission. Evidence of infection was supported by virus re-isolation from clinical specimens and post-mortem tissue samples, and viral antigen detection in tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Although there was evidence of mild malaise in infected ferrets (raised body temperature and weight loss), a distinct clinical syndrome with specific clinical signs was not identified in either ferrets or guinea pigs. Moreover, no histological lesions were attributed with confidence to infection by AchPV2. Mild tonsillitis, tracheitis and bronchiolitis were recorded in ferrets, but in some animals the lesions were identified without evidence of specific association with AchPV2 antigen. The ferrets were sourced from a colony free of influenza and canine distemper virus, were clinically healthy at the time of exposure to AchPV2, and were not maintained on a particulate substrate. The pathogenesis of these legions remains uncertain, although an opportunistic bacterial or other viral aetiology could not be excluded. In other tissues, such as bile duct epithelium and transitional epithelial cells of the bladder, viral antigen was seen without substantial inflammatory reaction or tissue injury.",

The results of quantitative real-time PCR, virus re-isolation and immunohistochemistry taken together identified the major sites of AchPV2 replication in ferrets to be respiratory tract epithelium and associated lymphoid tissues. Virus was able to be re-isolated from all of the ferrets at all time points from at least one tissue or clinical sample (swab or nasal wash) but not from blood. Although virus was not re-isolated from blood, the development of viremia may be inferred by confirmation of infection within spleen and urinary tract epithelium by immunohistochemistry and viral genome detection in the blood by quantitative real-time PCR. In the absence of other clinico-pathological support for CNS infection, virus in blood may also account for the re-isolation of AchPV2 from one sample of ferret brain tissue.",

Significantly, patterns of viral RNA detection from guinea pigs were generally similar to those in ferrets, but virus was not re-isolated from any tissue or clinical sample from guinea pigs and viral antigen was not demonstrated in their tissues by immunohistochemistry. The sites of AchPV2 replication in guinea pigs, therefore, could not be determined with confidence. Our observations suggest that guinea pigs are less permissive to AchPV2 infection than ferrets. When assessing the spill-over potential and working up an animal model for a novel virus, it is important to use animals from more than one species. There is no reliable method to determine the best species simply by characterising the virus, which is a big limitation of using virus discovery as a stand-alone surveillance strategy for zoonotic pathogen discovery. Therefore, it is only possible to do what is practical and feasible in terms of assessing potential spill-over hosts. Small laboratory animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs and mice, representing different mammalian orders or families, offer the most practical advantages for testing spill-over potential and, in this study, were a panel that demonstrated discriminatory power for the infection potential of the novel viruses tested.",

A novel Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), was designed that specifically targets the nucleoprotein gene (N-gene) of AchPV2. For the design process, the N-gene sequence of AchPV2 (JX051320), as well as other closely related paramyxoviruses including SCIEntIfIC REPORTS | (2018) 8:12744 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31193-z SosPV, MenPV and TioPV, was retrieved from GenBank. Subsequently, sequence alignments were performed using Geneious software (Version 8.1, Biomatters). Potential primer and probe regions distinctive of AchPV2 were identified from these alignments and candidate primers and probes assessed using the Primer Express 3.0.1 program (Thermofisher-Applied Biosystems). An assay spanning the 625-700 nucleotide region (75 nucleotides in length) of the N-gene of AchPV2 (JX051320), consists of forward primer: D-715 (5\u2032-GCAGGTCTGGATCACAGTATGC-3\u2032), reverse primer D-716 (5\u2032-TGCCAGTCGCCTCTCATCT-3\u2032), and probe D-717 (5\u2032[FAM]-TGCATGACAGCATATGATCAGCCCACT-[BHQ-1]-3\u2032. The optimized primer and probe concentrations and assay conditions were as follows: forward primer (D-715) and reverse primer (D-716): 300 nM, probe (D-716): 200 nM. Reactions were performed using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Thermofisher-Ambion) on an AB7500 Fast instrument using the thermal cycle: 1 cycle of 45 \u00b0C 10 min, 95 \u00b0C 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C 15 sec, 60 \u00b0C 45 sec.

The plate was observed for viral CPE after seven days and the serum neutralisation titre determined as being the dilution where 100% neutralisation was observed in duplicate wells. Serum samples that showed no neutralisation of virus in duplicate wells at the starting dilution (1:10) were described as negative.",

For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was performed using the DAKO PT LINK machine (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) by heating the tissue sections to 97 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and then cooling to 70 \u00b0C in the Envision Flex Target high pH retrieval solution (DAKO) and washing for 5 minutes in Tris Buffer. After this, endogenous peroxidases were quenched by the addition of 3% H 2 O 2 solution. Tissue sections were then incubated with the primary antibody, polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against AchPV2, at a dilution of 1:2000. The visualization system used was Envision FLEX/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with 3-Amino-9-Ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromogen (DAKO AEC + substrate chromagen K3469). Slides were then counterstained with Lillie-Mayer haematoxylin (Australian Biostain, Traralgon, Australia) and Scotts tap water before mounting. A duplicate set of tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain for histological examination using routine methods.",
