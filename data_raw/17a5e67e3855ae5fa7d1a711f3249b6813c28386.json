Previous work has shown IDE plays an important role in VZV infection and virus cell-to-cell spread, which is the sole route for VZV spread in vitro. Here we report that a recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) enhances VZV infectivity at an early step of infection associated with an increase in virus internalization, and increases cell-to-cell spread. VZV mutants lacking the IDE binding domain of gE were impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion. Pre-treatment of cell-free VZV with rIDE markedly enhanced the stability of the virus over a range of conditions. rIDE interacted with gE to elicit a conformational change in gE and rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis. Co-incubation of rIDE with gE modified the size of gE. We propose that the conformational change in gE elicited by IDE enhances infectivity and stability of the virus and leads to increased fusogenicity during VZV infection. The ability of rIDE to enhance infectivity of cell-free VZV over a wide range of incubation times and temperatures suggests that rIDE may be useful for increasing the stability of varicella or zoster vaccines.",

In humans, cell-free virions are released from skin lesions and are transmitted to epithelial cells in the respiratory tract of susceptible hosts [1] . In cell culture, however, no cell-free infectious virions are spontaneously released, and infection is exclusively by cell-to-cell spread of virus. While cell-free virus can be obtained by sonication of infected cells, the lack of high titer cell-free virus has hindered the progress of studies to define the mechanism by which VZV enters into target cells.",

Cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR ci ) has been proposed to facilitate an early step of VZV infection [2] . Previous studies from our laboratory showed that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a member of the zinc metalloproteinase family, is a putative cellular receptor for VZV [3] . Down-regulation of IDE by specific siRNA, inhibition of IDE activity with bacitracin, or blocking IDE with antibody inhibited VZV infection and impaired cell-to-cell spread of the virus. Overexpression of human IDE by transfection into cell lines resulted in increased entry of both cell-free and cell-associated virus. VZV glycoprotein E (gE), which is essential for virus infectivity [4, 5] , interacts with IDE through a binding domain located at the amino terminus of the ectodomain of gE that is not conserved in other human herpesviruses [3, 6, 7, 8] . VZV deleted for the IDE binding domain in gE is impaired for infectivity of cell-free virus [5] and shows reduced cell-to-cell spread of virus both in vitro and in human skin xenografts in SCID mice [5, 8] . Here, we show that the interaction of IDE with gE is important for VZV-induced syncytia formation and fusogenicity, and that recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) modifies gE, induces a conformation change in gE, enhances VZV infectivity, and stabilizes cell-free virus.",

The difference in the activity of these two proteins could be due to the difference in their amino termini. rIDE begins at a canonical initiation codon at amino acid 42. Purified rIDE showed a single band of 110 kD while native IDE purified from liver is actually a complex mixture of IDE forms. To further investigate the effect of rIDE on VZV infectivity, we incubated cell-free VZV ROka-lacZ with rIDE or control proteins for 15 min at 37uC before infecting human melanoma cells with the virus. Three days later, the cells were fixed and treated with Xgal and blue foci were counted. rIDE significantly enhanced VZV infectivity compared with control protein or SPGC buffer alone (P,0.001 for rIDE vs. control protein, Student t test, Fig. 2A ). Enhancement of infectivity was not observed when rIDE was added at 4 hr post-infection which bypasses the entry step (P,0.0001 for rIDE added at 15 min before infection vs. rIDE added 4 hr after infection by Student t test, Fig. 2A ). Denaturation of rIDE with 12.5 mM citric acid at pH 2.3 followed by neutralization with 0.5 M HEPES buffer at pH 9.0 to a final pH 7.0, inactivated the enhancing activity of IDE. These results indicate that the native form of rIDE is required to enhance infectivity and that rIDE functions at an early stage of infection. Incubation of rIDE with cell-free VZV at 37uC for 15 min before adding the virus to cells enhanced infectivity in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.0002 by ANOVA) (Fig. 2B ).",

Incubation of rIDE with virus prior to infection resulted in increased numbers of VZV genomes inside the cells, compared with virus incubated with a control protein, indicating that rIDE increases virus internalization (P,0.0001 for rIDE vs. P7.5, Fig. 4A ). Addition of rIDE at 2.5 hr after infection with VZV resulted in an increase in the size of virus was pre-treated with buffer, bovine serum albumin (BSA), rIDE (15 mg/ml), or denatured rIDE (IDE treated with acid and then base to a final neutral pH) at 37uC for 15 min before infecting melanoma cells. Infected cells were stained with X-gal at 3 days after infection to identify the number of VZV-positive foci. The experiment was repeated 10 times and a representative experiment is shown. For the 5 th bar, cells were infected with the same amount of virus as in bars 1-4, and rIDE was then added to the cells 4 hours post-infection. For the last two bars, the virus was incubated with rIDE or buffer at 37uC for 15 min and kept at 25uC for 18 hrs before infecting MeWo cells. (B) Cell-free ROka-LacZ was pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of rIDE (shown in mg/ml) at 37uC for 15 min and infected cells were stained with X-gal. The experiment was performed twice and one result is shown. The control proteins, P7.5 and BZLF2, were used at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. (C) Cell-free VZV (ROka-LacZ) was pre-incubated with rIDE, buffer, or filtrate passing through the rIDE purification column under the indicated conditions and infected cells were stained with X-gal at 4 days post-infection. The filtrate (control) consists of HA peptide which was used to elute rIDE from the purification column. (D) Cell-free ROka-LacZ virus was incubated with buffer, bovine serum albumen (BSA), filtrate that passed through without binding to a rIDE purification column, or rIDE for 18 hrs at 25uC before infecting cells and staining with X-gal.

This is consistent with our earlier observation that IDE is important for infection with both cell-free and cell-associated VZV [3] . . rIDE promotes VZV internalization during entry and cell-to-cell spread of virus. (A) Cell free ROka-lacZ was incubated with P7.5 control protein or rIDE for 30 min at 37uC, the mixture was incubated with cells for 60 min on ice to allow binding followed by 90 min at 37uC for entry, and DNA was then extracted from the cells and the copy number of intracellular VZV genomes was determined by real-time PCR. The ratio of VZV ORF 62 DNA to cellular RNaseP DNA is shown on the y axis. The experiment was performed three times and a representative result is shown. (B) Melanoma cells were infected with ROka-lacZ, 2.5 hrs later the inoculum was removed by washing with PBS, rIDE was added to the cells, and 3 days later the cells were stained with X-gal. Blue VZV-infected foci were photographed at a magnification 40X and plaque sizes were measured with ImageJ software as previously described [3] . N is the number of plaques measured. (C) Cell-free VZV from a commercial lot of zoster vaccine was incubated with rIDE for 30 min, melanoma cells were infected with the mixture for 4 days, and the cells were fixed and stained with anti-gE monoclonal antibody and infected foci were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

While IDE interacts with a variety of substrates, it cleaves only a subset of its substrates such as insulin and b-amyloid protein at perceptible rates [15, 16] . Previously, we incubated the extracellular domain of gE (gEt) with IDE protein extracted from liver and did not detect cleavage or degradation of gEt using a monoclonal antibody [3] . To determine if rIDE modifies gE, we incubated biotin-labeled gEt protein with rIDE or control proteins (P7.5-Fc which encodes vaccinia virus P7.5 protein or BZLF2-Fc which encodes Epstein-Barr virus BZLF2 protein) at 37uC, 22uC, or 4uC for 30 min. The proteins were then boiled in sample buffer, separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, and gEt was stained with streptavidin conjugated-horse radish peroxidase. Incubation of gEt with rIDE, but not with the control proteins, resulted in a slightly smaller sized band than full length gEt, indicating that rIDE modifies gEt (Fig. 5A ). While it was somewhat surprising that rIDE modified gE after incubation at 4uC, this is consistent with our observations that rIDE enhanced VZV infectivity at 4uC (Fig. 3B) .",

Since VZV gE has an important role in syncytia formation and membrane fusion [19] , we postulated that gE might undergo a conformational change after binding to rIDE. Limited exposure of ligand-receptor complexes to proteinase has been used to detect receptor-induced conformational changes in several proteins, including avian sarcoma/leucosis virus (ALV) envelope protein complexed with its receptor Tva and spike protein of mouse hepatitis virus complexed with soluble receptor, CEA-CAM1a [20, 21, 22] . The extracellular domain of gE was labeled with Figure 5 . rIDE modifies gEt and induces a conformational change in gEt. (A) Biotin labeled gEt-Fc protein (arrow) was incubated with rIDE at the indicated temperature for 30 min. After electrophoresis and transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were visualized with streptavidinconjugated-horse radish peroxidase. (B) Biotin-labeled gEt-His protein (arrow) was incubated with buffer, control protein BZLF2 or P7.5, rIDE (produced in baculovirus) at 37uC for 30 min, followed by urea for 18 hr and thermolysin for 30 sec. The proteins were separated by electropheresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and proteins were detected using streptavidin-conjugated horse radish peroxidase. (C) Biotin-labeled gEt-His protein (arrow) was incubated with rIDE or control proteins at 37uC for 30 min, followed by incubation with 4 mg/ml of endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) at 37uC for 45 sec. The digestion was then terminated by adding 0.5 M EDTA and samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer with 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by electrophoresis. Protein fragments were detected by streptavidin conjugated-horse radish peroxidase. (D) Binding of catalytically inactive IDE mutant protein IDE-E111Q to gEt fails to induce a conformational change in gE. Biotin-labeled gEt-His protein (arrow) was incubated with rIDE (produced by baculovirus), IDE-E111Q (produced in bacteria), or IDE-w. t. (produced in bacteria), or negative control proteins as indicated at 37uC for 30 min, followed by thermolysin and processed as described in panel B. biotin and incubated with rIDE, buffer, or control protein (P7.5-Fc) at room temperature for 30 min followed by addition of thermolysin, a proteinase that hydrolyzes peptide bonds at hydrophobic residues, for 30 sec. Proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and incubated with streptavidin conjugated-horse radish peroxidase. Incubation of gEt with rIDE, but not with buffer or control protein, resulted in a reduction in the intensity of the 70 kDa gEt band ( Fig. 5B and 5D ). Similar results were also observed with endoproteinase Asp-N digestion (Fig. 5C) . Therefore, rIDE triggered a conformational change in VZV gEt that confers an increased susceptibility to proteinase. Repeated attempts to determine a cleavage site on gE by N-terminal protein sequencing failed to generate any sequences.",

Melanoma cells infected with ROka68D32-71 showed large numbers of enveloped virions accumulating at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 9A ) and on the cell surface (Fig. 9B) . In 53 randomly selected immune-electron micrographs, there were a total of 873 gEpositive ROka68D32-71 virions on the cell surface and/or in cell junctions, compared with a total 140 gE-positive ROka virions in 41 pictures (Fig. 9C , P,0.00001 for ROka68D32-71 vs. ROka), indicating that the impairment in syncytia formation and cell-tocell spread of the IDE binding domain mutant virus is not due to defective maturation with reduced transport to the cell surface or to cell-cell junctions. A previous study showed that VZV gE is myristylated [24] . Myristylation of proteins is important for their association with membranes. To rule out the possibility that deletion of the IDE binding domain of gE does not adversely affect gE myristylation, we labeled ROka or ROka68D32-71 infected cells with 3 H-myristic acid and immunoprecipitated gE. gE from both parental and mutant VZV showed similar levels of myristylation, indicating that differences in myristylation do not explain the phenotype observed with the mutant virus (Fig. 10) . Therefore, the IDE binding domain of gE is important for membrane fusogenicity, syncytia formation, and for cell-to-cell spread of the virus.",

The observation that gE produced by the baculovirus expression system is smaller in size than its counterpart produced from mammalian cells (Li et al., unpublished data) suggests that it is less glycosylated in insect cells. gE produced by baculovirus forms a complex with IDE [3] , which implies that glycosylation of gE may not be important for interaction with IDE. Carpenter et. al. reported that IDE binds to the mature 98-kDa form of VZV gE under low salt conditions, but IDE binds only to the 73 kDa form of gE at high salt conditions [27] . They showed that tunicamycin blocks glycosylation of gE in the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in only production of the 73 kDa form of gE, and that in the presence of tunicamycin, gE was blocked in its transit out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore they concluded that IDE must interact only with the 73 kDa form of gE in the cytosol and that this binding does not represent a receptor/ligand interaction. Interestingly, a previous study by these authors showed that the smaller form of gE is present on cell surface, recycles through the endocytotic pathway, and is incorporated into virions [28] . Studies from other groups also showed that a mixture of forms of gE ranging from ,50-100 kDa are present in purified virions [29, 30, 31] . Therefore, the 73 kDa form of gE is present in virions where it may interact with IDE.",

Nectin-1 and 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate function as receptors for HSV [36, 37] . Soluble 3-O-sulfated heparin sulfate triggers HSV entry into non-permissive cells and augments viral glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion [38] . A soluble truncated form of nectin-1 lacking the transmembrane domain confers HSV susceptibility to non-permissive cells [39] . Further studies showed that the soluble V domain of nectin-1, (amino acid residues 1-123), promotes HSV entry. Interestingly, in this study neither free nor gD-bound sNec1 123 was bound to the cell surface, suggesting that the interaction of soluble receptor with its gD ligand facilitates virus penetration by activating viral fusion machinery rather than directly enhancing virus attachment to cells [40] . While rIDE increased VZV infectivity at an early stage of infection, treatment of radiolabeled VZV with rIDE did not enhance virus binding (Fig. 11) . Thus, soluble rIDE appears to promote VZV infectivity by increasing the efficiency of entry of virus into cells, rather than enhancing attachment. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that rIDE increases internalization of VZV DNA within 90 min of initiating infection.",

The conformational change results in exposed viral fusion peptides and provides energy for the fusion process through refolding [18, 41, 42] . For larger viruses such as HSV, the fusion machinery consists of more than one glycoprotein working in concert [43, 44] . Since VZV gE is not fusogenic when expressed alone, but does act as a fusogen in concert with other glycoproteins [45] , it is possible that the conformational changes elicited by rIDE may either directly enhance fusogenicity of gE, or allow recruitment of glycoproteins gB and gH, to form a fusion complex.",

            "text": "In addition to the receptor-binding mediated conformational change of viral glycoprotein, sequential conformational changes induced by proteolysis are required during the entry process of several viruses. Proteases cleave viral fusion proteins, including glycoproteins, into mature, fusogenic forms and enhance virus binding and infectivity [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53] . Our finding that rIDE, a metalloproteinase, triggers a conformational change in gE and modifies the size of gE suggests that a proteolytic activity of IDE might be important for VZV infectivity. This is further supported by the fact that the IDE mutant (IDE-E111Q) which is impaired for degradation of insulin, fails to induce a conformational change in gE. Since gE is much larger than insulin and gE lacks any detectable amino acid homology with other substrates of IDE, the interacting amino acid residues of IDE with insulin and gE are likely to be different. Therefore, there may be a proteolytic motif of IDE for gE which is different from that for degrading insulin.",

Previous work by Hambleton and colleagues suggested VZV enters human fibroblasts through an endocytosis pathway [56] . Although we have shown that rIDE enhances VZV internalization, it is not clear whether this occurs at the cell surface or in endosomes. In most cell types, endogenous IDE localizes primarily in endosomes and other subcellular compartments with about 10% on the cell surface or in extracellular spaces. It is interesting to note that upon receptor binding, activation of coronavirus glycoprotein by extracellular proteases facilitates virus entry through the cell surface plasma membrane, while in the absence of extracellular proteases the virus enters the cell using the endosomal pathway [22] .",

            "text": "We found that rIDE increased the stability of cell-free VZV. There are two possible explanations for how rIDE might enhance virus stability. First, interaction of a virus glycoprotein with its receptor may convert the glycoprotein from its native state to a new metastable state resulting in a long-lived envelope proteinreceptor intermediate. ALV pre-loaded with a form of soluble receptor, Tva/Tvb, is very stable at 37uC [57] . Second, pretreatment of virus with its receptor may target the virus to enter cells through a pathway that is more favorable for infection. ALV bound to the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored form of its receptor (Tva) accumulates in a fusion compartment where it is more stable than if it enters though the transmembrane-anchored form of the receptor [58] . Although endogenous IDE is found both on the cell surface and in endosomes, it does not contain a predicted membrane anchoring domain. It has been postulated, however, that IDE might contain a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor [59] . Cell-free VZV is usually produced in vitro by sonicating infected cells and the virus is very labile. The current varicella and zoster vaccines used in the United States are supplied as lyophilized viruses that must be stored at 220uC or colder, and used within 30 minutes after they are reconstituted in aqueous solution [60] . rIDE might be useful as an additive for cell-free VZV vaccines to improve their stability.",

Transmission of VZV in vitro occurs exclusively by cell-to-cell spread. Grose and colleagues have postulated that VZV has evolved viral glycoproteins geared more towards cell-to-cell fusion to mediate syncytia formation rather than towards virus-to-cell fusion as seen in HSV [19] . Several studies suggest that gE has an important role in virusinduced membrane fusion during infection [19, 61] . gE promotes fusion when co-expressed with either gB or gH in transfected cells or using a vaccinia virus expression system [45, 62] . Berarducci et al. described a VZV mutant (rOka-P27-Y51) with a deletion in part of the IDE binding domain of gE that shows reduced cell-tocell spread [7] . Our findings that a VZV mutant deleted for the IDE binding domain is impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion provides further evidence for the role of gE both as a receptor binding molecule and as a contributor to fusogenicity. We propose that the interaction of IDE with gE results in receptor binding and a conformational change that may include proteolysis. This process would lead to enhanced fusogenicity either alone or in conjunction with the recruitment of other viral glycoproteins during entry of VZV into target cells.",
