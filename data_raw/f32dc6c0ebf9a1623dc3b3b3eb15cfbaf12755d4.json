In this study, we conducted a survey of CaKoV at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018. Results: Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms (n = 252). Of 307 swab samples tested by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs (25.45%). Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in domestic dogs. In this study, we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole genomes of Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99.5% amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand. CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs. The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs. Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs. Our result raises the concerns to vet practitioners that diarrhea in dogs due to canine Kobuvirus infection should not be ignored.",

We tested 307 rectal swab samples for CaKoV by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene. Based on a two-year survey, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44% (49/252)) and healthy (9.09% (5/55)) animals. Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in dogs (Figs. 1 and 2). In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 25.45% (42/165) (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). The coinfections of CaKoV with other enteric viral pathogens were observed including CaKoV/Canine parvovirus/Canine Coronavirus (n = 6), CaKoV/Canine parvovirus (n = 20) and CaKoV/Canine Coronavirus (n = 2). In this study, 12 CaKoVs were selected and characterized by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). The viruses were selected to represent epidemiological and demographic data such as age, date of isolation and breed. In this study, nucleotide sequences of the CaKoV were submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK201776 -MK201795 (Table 1) .",

Phylogenetic analysis of 3D and VP1 of Thai CaKoVs and reference CaKoVs from various animal species were also performed.

To the best of our knowledge, the CaKoV was described in Asia in retrospective study in Korea in 2011 and have been reported in Japan, China and Australia, respectively [2, 15, 17, 21] . However, the CaKoV have never been reported in the country or South East Asia region. In this study, during the 2 year-survey program, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. Compare to other studies, CaKoV % positivity in this study was lower than those in China (54%) and Korea (32.2%) [14, 22] . Our result showed that the CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 27% which consistence with previous reports [15] . Similar to other previous studies, co-infections with other enteric viral pathogens were observed such as CaKoV/Canine parvovirus and CaKoV/ Canine Coronavirus [12, 14, 15] . Moreover, CaKoVs were detected in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs which consistent with other studies [2, 15] . Our result supported that this virus may not be the only cause of enteric disease in dogs. Nevertheless, the CaKoV infection have still been identified in symptomatic dogs without other enteric pathogen infections [12] . Our observation supported that the role of CaKoV as a primary pathogen of acute gastroenteritis remain unclear.",

This observation supported phylogenetic analysis that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub-cluster but in separated sub-cluster from (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) (100) 100 (100) 97.1 (100) 99.4 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) (100) 96 (100) the viruses from the US, UK, Brazil and Tanzania. Of all viral genes, the VP1 gene was the most diverse gene among Thai CaKoVs and other reference CaKoVs. Similar observation was also reported in previous study that VP1 protein is the most variable capsid protein [24] . It is noted that the putative proline rich region at VP1-228-240 (P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was observed both in Thai CaKoVs and reference viruses. Previous studies indicated that proline rich region may associate with enteric receptor binding of the viruses [14, 24] . It is noted that Thai CaKoVs posed unique PPP (VP1; 228-240), which also observed most reference viruses from China, Korea, Japan, US, UK suggesting unique characteristic. These unique amino acids were not observed in the CaKoV from the Australia (CE9), Brazil (BRA/26) and Tanzania (TZ/75, TZ82) [16, 20] . However, the association of these unique amino acids and viral pathogenesis is still need to be further investigated. Based on genetic analysis, unique amino acids at the position, 65 V, 67D, 119L, 138 T, 150P, 151M, 153D, 201S, 204Q, 205Q, 201Q, 213 T and 241E were observed. These unique amino acids of China/ Thailand sub-cluster could be benefit for the detection of virus origin or diagnostic purpose in the future. Similar to previous study, analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among CaKoVs except one variation at 776/777 (VP3/VP1) which unique in wild carnivores [16] .",

Briefly, one-step RT-PCR was conducted in a total final volume of 25 \u03bcl comprising 3 \u03bcl of template RNA, 15 \u03bcl of 2xReaction Mix (Invitrogen, USA), 0.6 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers, 1.2 \u03bcl of SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen, USA) and distilled water to final volume 25 \u03bcl. The condition of RT-PCR assay included cDNA synthesis step at 55\u00b0C for 30 min, next to an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, following 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1 min, as well as, final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. To confirm CaKoV, 4 \u03bcl of PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, which mixed with Red Safe at 100 V for 45 min. The expected size of CaKoV positive amplified products was 631 bp. Due to dogs showed clinical signs similar to other canine viral enteric diseases, all samples were also tested for Canine Parvovirus (n = 307),In this study, four CaKoV positive samples (CU-53, CU-101, CU-247 and CU-716) were selected for whole genome sequencing and additional eight CaKoV positive samples were selected for 3D and VP1 gene sequencing. The CaKoVs were selected based on epidemiological and demographic data such as age, date of isolation, breed, and vaccination history. For sequencing, nucleotide sequences of each gene of the viruses were amplified by new primer sets designed by using Primer 3 plus program[28]. List of oligonucleotide primers is provided in Additional file 1:Table S1In brief, PCR was proceed in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl containing 2 \u03bcl of cDNA, 0.4 \u03bcM of each forward and reverse primer, 1X TopTaq Master Mix, 1X Coral Load, and distilled water. The PCR condition was set as initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50-55\u00b0C for 45 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1-1.30 min; and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min.
