            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products. The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions. The interactions identified provide valuable material for future studies.

Within a few months, the disease spread to a large number of countries and caused more than 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths. The causative pathogen identified was shown to be a new human coronavirus designated the SARS-CoV [1] . Tight intervention strategies limited the further spread of the pathogen. Sequence analysis of the first isolates of the newly identified SARS-CoV revealed characteristic features typical of the known three coronavirus groups [2] [3] [4] . According to several phylogenetic analyses the virus is grouped either a novel group IV or an early split-off of group II coronaviruses [5, 6] .",

            "text": "The genome of the SARS-CoV consists of a positive-stranded RNA of approximately 29,700 nt in length. The replicase genes span the first two-thirds of the genome containing the two overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b, which are connected by a ribosomal frameshift. The two polyproteins expressed are predicted to encode and to be cleaved by a papain-like proteinase 2 (PL-Pro = part of nsp3) and a 3C-like proteinase (3CL-Pro = nsp5) to 16 mature replicase proteins [1, 6] . They are well conserved between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. It is suggested that they are required for the synthesis of the full-length genome and subgenomic RNA synthesis as well as for virus replication [6, 7] . Functions of the processed proteins include a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (nsp9) an RNA-dependendent RNA polymerase (RdRp = nsp12) as well as a non-canonical RdRp (nsp8) synthesizing short primers for nsp12, a superfamily 1like helicase (HEL1 = nsp13), and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU = nsp15) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nsp3, nsp14, nsp16 are thought to have ADP-ribose 19-phosphatase, 39-.59 exonuclease and 29-O-ribose methyltransferase activities, respectively [6] . But many of the functions of the nsps are still unknown. At their 59terminus the subgenomic mRNAs share a common leader sequence encoded at the 59-end of the genome, which is joined to the respective gene sequences at specific transcription regulatory sequences. Their common 39-ends extend to the end of the genome.",

These genes, ORF3a/b, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b, and ORF9b are not found in other coronaviruses and their functions with respect to replication and pathogenesis are not well understood. There is evidence that some of the accessory ORFs can be deleted individually or in combination with almost no impact on in vitro growth, RNA synthesis, or on in vivo virus replication in a murine model [16] . Also, the nsp2 replicase protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture. Its deletion results in attenuation of viral growth and RNA synthesis [17] . There are reports that a number of MHV and SARS-CoV replicase proteins colocalize and eventually interact in cytoplasmic membrane bound complexes, in which viral RNA synthesis occurs [18, 19] . Direct interactions of nsp7 and nsp8 in a hexadecameric supercomplex could be demonstrated by crystallography [20] . Interactions of the structural N and M proteins were demonstrated by a mammalian two-hybrid system [21] .",

Interactions for the cellular networks were derived from the following sources: S. cerevisiae from DIP (the Database of Interacting Proteins) [45] , the yeast two-hybrid interactions of H. sapiens from the studies of Stelzl et al. [28] and literature interactions from Rual et al. [27] , predicted human interactions (core) from Lehner and Fraser [29] and interactions taken from the HPRD (human protein reference database) [46] . Parameters shown include the number of nodes and edges in the networks, the average degree, characteristic path length (average shortest path), diameter (maximum shortest path), clustering coefficient and for the clustering coefficient enrichment values compared to appropriate random networks (ER and ES). Both types of random networks contain the same number of nodes and edges as the original network. ER networks [47] are created by connecting edges randomly, whereas ES networks are created by an edge swapping strategy which preserves the degree distribution (see [26, 48] ORF3a, ORF7a and M were detected in the Golgi, ORF3b in the nucleus, ORF6, ORF7b, nsp3N and nsp16 in the ER ( Figure 5 ). ORF8b and ORF14 showed a vesicular staining, and nsp2 was found both in cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. Orf3a and M were found to be interacting by Y2H, and were both detected in the Golgi. Similarly, ORF6 and ORF7b were both found in the ER.",

From a number of recent structural studies it is clear that during the viral life cycle large replication complexes are formed, which involve a large number of viral proteins [31] . SARS-CoV is a representative of the Coronaviridae, the largest RNA viruses known (27 to 32 kb, plus-stranded). SARS-CoV expresses at least 16 non-structural replicase proteins which are cleaved co-and post-translationally from two precursor polyproteins by two viral proteinases, four structural proteins and a set of eight accessory proteins specific for the individual virus groups [6] . Since the polypeptide processing sites of non-structural proteins are well defined, we chose the strategy to subclone all individual ORFs predicted, and not to use the precursor polyproteins. Using this approach we expected to avoid problems in the expression, folding or targeting of the polypeptides due to incorrect processing. Such problems had been reported for yeast two-hybrid assays performed with the plus-stranded RNA viruses Hepatitis C virus [32] and wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) [33] , where interactions had been observed only when random fragments, not mature proteins were used. But there are also reports on potato virus A (PVA) and pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PsbMV), which belong to the potyvirus (+) strand RNA virus family similar to WSMV [34] , as well as on a subset of poliovirus proteins [35] , where interactions have been detected among cloned mature proteins.",

One of the most interesting interactor proteins found in our study is nsp8, which interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14. The importance of this protein is supported by recently reported crystallization studies, which described the multimeric association of various of the non-strucutural proteins. Nsp 8 seems to be one of the proteins involved in these complexes. Nsp8 deletion or irreversible fusion to nsp7 or nsp 9 by mutagenesis of the corresponding cleavage site results in a lethal phenotype supporting the idea that nsp8 is absolutely essential for virus replication (Deming et al., submitted). Evidence has been presented for interaction with nsp9, a ssRNA-binding protein, by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and by a decrease of the disorder of the nsp8 N-terminal region after the addition of nsp9 [36] . Furthermore, a hexadecameric nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex was described which was suggested to encircle RNA where it may serve as a general processivity factor for the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) nsp12 (19) . A very recent report described nsp8 as a second RdRp of SARS-CoV. It was shown to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of ,6 residues in a low fidelity reaction which eventually might serve as primers for the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp [15] . For MHV it was shown that RdRp co-immunoprecipitates with nsp8, nsp9, nsp5 and the helicase nsp13 [37] , and that it also colocalizes with nsp7, nsp9 and nsp10 [18, 37] . Thus, the nsp8 interactions found by us are confirmed by a number of different studies and it seems to play an important role in the viral replication complex.",

As shown by CoIP, it also self interacts to a dimeric or multimeric complex. The relatively large number of interactions might imply a crucial role of nsp2 in the viral life cycle. However, it was shown by deletion mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV that neither the encoding genomic RNA sequences nor the nsp2 proteins are necessary for the generation of infectious viruses in cell culture [17] . Since these viruses displayed slightly reduced phenotypes in growth, RNA synthesis but not protein processing, it was speculated that nsp2 might play a role in global RNA synthesis, and possibly in virus-cell interactions or viral pathogenesis. The reported subcellular localization of individually expressed nsp2 in delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells [17] is similar to the diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear immunofluorescence staining pattern found with our N-or C-terminally tagged nsp2 proteins. Thus, the exogenously expressed nsp2 does not target specific membranes in the absence of infection. However, after coinfection with a MHV mutant virus lacking nsp2, the protein expressed in trans was reported to be recruited into distinct viral replication complexes. This relocalization of nsp2 to small vesicular foci in the cytoplasm was also confirmed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence staining with anti-nsp2 antibodies [19] .",

The most interesting accessory protein with respect to interactions in our study turned out to be ORF9b. Y2H interactions with nsp8 and nsp14 were found bi-directionally and the self-interaction could also be confirmed by CoIP. Latter result is confirmed by recent structure data [39] . The ORF9b protein, which is encoded within the nucleocapsid gene, is an intertwined dimer with an amphipathic outer surface and a long hydrophobic lipid binding tunnel. This suggests that ORF9b is targeted to ER-Golgi compartments via an unusual anchoring mechanism and acts as an accessory protein during virion assembly. Although most of the accessory proteins do not seem to play pivotal roles in viral replication, they might still be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity. Currently, there is no reasonable explanation for the large number of interactions found for ORF9b by the Y2H screen. As deletion of ORF9b does not seriously reduce virus replication in vitro consistent with a luxury function, the 9b protein may function to enhance the global stability of the SARS proteome network and play some unrealized role in regulating virus-host protein-protein interactions. It thus might be more important for enhancing in vivo virulence.",

[41] observed using EGFP-tagged constructs. As a structural protein ORF3a interacts with the M protein [23] which was also clearly found in the Golgi as Flag fusion proteins. The nuclear localization of ORF3b is also reasonable because it induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis [42] . Proteins ORF6 and ORF7b, interacting in Y2H and CoIP, were both found in the ER. To our knowledge this localization has not been described for ORF7b before. Not much is known about ORF9b other than it is expressed in infected cells [43] and that antibodies to it are found in infected patients [44] . As opposed to Meier et al. [39] , who located ORF9b to intracellular vesicular structures (293T cells), we found it to be diffusely distributed within cytoplasm and nucleus (HeLa cells).",

It, thus, appears as a single module such as the KSHV network and is not subdivided into separate functional modules as cellular networks. Based on currently known and predicted host-virus interactions, a joint virus-human network was derived in which the viral part of the network appears to be separated from the main host network. In this respect, the SARS network differs from the KSHV viral network which is incorporated into the host interactome. However, this may be due to the small number of virus-host interactions identified so far for SARS. Indeed for KSHV, the predicted virus-host network was based on about twice as many interactions to the host. To better understand the role of the intraviral protein interactions it is necessary to gain more knowledge on the SARS-CoV with it's host during infection.",

Although, it is generally acknowledged and certainly has to be taken into account that Y2H assays are error-prone by producing false positives and false negative results, we identified a large number of interactions which have not been reported previously and which could be confirmed biochemically. These interactions will be of great help for further studies which are aiming at the elucidation of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. Future experiments with the mutant viruses lacking nsp2, nsp8 or ORF9b will show the relevance of the interactions detected for virus replication, growth and pathogenicity in vitro and in vivo model systems.",

Cells were pelleted and resupended in 1 ml NP-buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Bicine pH 8.35), pelleted a second time and resuspended in 200 ml NPbuffer and plated on to SD medium (+2% agar) lacking either leucine (prey) or tryptophane (bait). Colonies were visible after 2-3 days. The yeast strains AH109 and Y187 containing proteins in prey and bait were arrayed in a 96-deep-well plates with SD liquid media lacking leu or trp according to the interactions to be tested. The liquid cultures were transferred on to SD medium plates lacking leu or trp using a 384-pin replica tool (Nunc). Colonies were grown for 2 days at 30uC and used directly for mating on YPD medium plates. Each mating was performed in quadruplicates, and after 2 days at 30uC the colonies were stamped onto SD medium (-Leu-Trp) plates. The interactions were assessed by transfer to SD-Leu-Trp-His plates, and interactions considered positive if at least three out of four possible colonies grew. Viral proteins acting as self-activating baits were analyzed on increasing amounts of +3 mM 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT, Sigma) (3 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM), and excluded from the results if no clear positive interactions could be determined.",

One hour post infection, viruscontaining medium was removed and substituted by DMEM/1% FCS. Ten micrograms (per dish) of the respective pGBKT7-SARS-CoV-ORF and pGADT7-SARS-CoV-ORF plasmids were then transfected into two 10 cm dishes of 293 cells using the calcium phosphate method. After 20 to 24 h, cells were lysed by incubation in NP-40 lysis-buffer (1% NP-40, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 1 mM PMSF, one tablet of Complete protease inhibtor cocktail (Roche) per 50 ml on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 20.5006 g for 10 min and precleared using 50 ml preequilibrated protein G-sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia). Lysates were precipitated using either 5 ml (200 mg/ml) mouse monoclonal anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 10 ml (100 mg/ml) rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics GmBH) antibodies in the presence of 50 ml protein G Sepharose beads and incubated ON at 4uC by overhead rotation. The beads were washed 3 times in ice-cold NP-40 buffer and resuspended in 26SDS protein sample buffer. Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% or 15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) membranes in Western blot chambers ON at 4uC. Filters were blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST (50 mM Tris, pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0,05% Tween-20) for 1 h. They were then incubated with the anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies at dilutions of 1:1000 ON at 4uC. Filters were washed three times for 10 min with TBST. Incubation with the secondary, peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG or anti-rat IgG (1:3000 each) antibodies (Jackson) was carried out for two to three hours. After three further washing steps filters were developed using the ECL TM Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).
