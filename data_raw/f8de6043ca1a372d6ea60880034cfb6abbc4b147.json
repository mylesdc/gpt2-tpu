To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced 10 complete genomes of MERS-CoVs isolated from 2 live and 8 dead dromedaries from different regions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Phylogenetic analysis revealed one novel clade A strain, the first detected in the UAE, and nine clade B strains. Strain D998/15 had a distinct phylogenetic position within clade A, being more closely related to the dromedary isolate NRCE-HKU205 from Egypt than to the human isolates EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012. A comparison of predicted protein sequences also demonstrated the existence of two clade A lineages with unique amino acid substitutions, A1 (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) and A2 (D998/15 and NRCE-HKU205), circulating in humans and camels, respectively. The nine clade B isolates belong to three distinct lineages: B1, B3 and B5. Two B3 strains, D1271/15 and D1189.1/15, showed evidence of recombination between lineages B4 and B5 in ORF1ab. Molecular clock analysis dated the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clade A to March 2011 and that of clade B to November 2011. Our data support a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse MERS-CoVs including recombinant strains in the UAE.",

Although 91 of the sequences were obtained from MERS-CoV in dromedaries, a large proportion of them were from a recent study in Saudi Arabia. 13 The small number of dromedary MERS-CoV genomes obtained from other countries has hindered understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary history of the virus in camels outside of Saudi Arabia. In our previous report on MERS-CoV epidemiology in Dubai, nine dromedary MERS-CoV strains were sequenced and found to be closely related. 14 Recently, we have reported another dromedary MERS-CoV strain detected in an isolated dromedary herd in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 15 Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that this MERS-CoV strain is a unique member of a cluster of closely related MERS-CoV strains obtained from patients in the Hafr-Al-Batin region of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, 16, 17 as well as those from patients in the recent Korean outbreak. 18 From the results of these two studies, we hypothesized that diverse MERS-CoV strains may be circulating in dromedaries of the UAE. To test this hypothesis, we performed complete genome sequencing of 10 additional strains of MERS-CoV isolated from dromedaries in different regions of the UAE. The results support a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse strains from multiple sources in the same farm. A novel clade A strain, the first identified in the UAE, may belong to a separate lineage, A2, circulating in dromedaries.",

Two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 \u03bcL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates containing Vero cells for adsorption inoculation. After 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with 1 mL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco). The cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for cytopathic effect (CPE) for five days. Each of the cultures exhibited the typical CPE of detachment and rounding of cells. All cultures with a CPE were confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV through a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay targeting a region of the viral genome upstream of the envelope gene and isothermal amplification with a Genie instrument (Optigene Limited, Horsham, UK).",

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome, ORF1a, ORF1b and the S gene sequences all showed that the clade A strain, D998/15, isolated from a 1-month-old dromedary calf from a special dairy farm in Dubai, is a unique member of clade A, being most closely related to another dromedary isolate, NRCE-HKU205, which was previously detected in Egypt ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, these two isolates formed a separate cluster distinct from the other two known clade A strains, EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012, both isolated from humans. The results suggest that clade A isolates from humans and camels may form two separate lineages, A1 and A2. This hypothesis is further supported by analysis of amino acid substitutions along the whole genome sequences. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of proteins among clade A1, clade A2 and the six lineages of B strains showed a total of 16 substitutions, most occurring in the viral nsp3 and S proteins (Table 2) . Notably, two substitutions in nsp3, at positions 1574 and 1717, were found within the catalytic domain of PL pro . 24 Highly variable residues were observed at position 1574, which has been reported to be under positive selection. 25 Another substitution in the S protein at position 1020 (glutamine in clade A strains and histidine/ arginine in clade B strains) was found within heptad repeat 1 of the S2 region. Interestingly, the heptad repeat region has recently been reported to be a major selection target among MERS-CoVs, and different residues at position 1020 may affect the stability of the sixhelix bundle formed by the heptad repeats. 26 There were nine amino acid substitutions between clade A and B strains, and five amino acid substitutions between clade A1 and A2 strains. From these results, we propose that the two clade A dromedary isolates D998/15 and NRCE-HKU205 should be classified under a new lineage, A2, which is distinct from the two clade A human isolates EMC/2012 and Jordan/ 2012.",

The divergence time of the present 10 dromedary strains is shown in Figure 6 . On the basis of time-resolved phylogeny, the root of the tree is January 2011 (95% HPD: June 2010, Table 2 Comparison of amino acid substitutions between different clades and lineages (Figure 6 ). (Figure 2) . Interestingly, the source clade A strain, D988/15, was isolated from a young female dromedary in a special dairy farm with camel mothers from Pakistan. Therefore, the source of this virus was most probably different from that of the seven clade B strains, which were isolated from dromedaries from a different dairy farm. The latter farm is a large closed system, which may explain the relative genetic closeness of the circulating MERS-CoV strains. Yet, the seven This polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV is unique among human CoVs. Such a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries is similar to the diverse lineages of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, 28, 29 but in contrast to the monophyletic origin of most human SARS-CoV strains, MERS-CoV strains from humans are polyphyletic as a result of multiple camel-to-human transmission events. 30, 31 According to the existing evidence, a single interspecies transmission event probably occurred from bats to palm civets as the intermediate or amplification host, and then from palm civets to humans before the SARS epidemic in 2003. 28, 32, 33 The rapid expansion of the epidemic arose after efficient human-to-human transmission of the human SARS-CoV strains. In contrast, MERS-CoV has become endemic in dromedaries of the UAE and other countries in the Middle East, with diverse strains being introduced into the human population. This finding is in line with the overall MERS-CoV phylogeny in the Middle East, with the tMRCA of all MERS-CoVs being dated back to around January 2011, thus suggesting that MER-CoV has emerged in humans relatively recently (Figures 2 and 6) . The difference in evolutionary pathways between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also provides an explanation for why, MERS-unlike SARS, which disappeared rapidly after civets were segregated from humans by closing wild animal markets in provinces in Southern China-has persisted for more than three years and will probably continue to circulate in dromedaries and humans unless effective vaccines are available. Recently, viruses closely related to human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) have also been found in camels. 34 However, in contrast to the polyphyletic origin of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the HCoV 229E and related dromedary-derived viruses were each monophyletic, thus suggesting that this endemic human coronavirus may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses.",

At present, there are only a few clade A isolates, including the first human MERS-CoV isolated in Saudi Arabia (EMC/2012), another human isolate from Jordan (Jordan-N3/2012), two dromedary strains from Egypt (NRCE-HKU205 and NRCE-HKU270 with partial sequence available only) 35 and six Nigerian strains (genome not completely sequenced). 36 Although clade A strains are much less common than clade B strains, our results suggest that diverse clade A MERS-CoVs may be present in various countries in the Middle East and Africa. Both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analyses showed that the current clade A strains may consist of two distinct lineages: one from humans (A1) and one from camels (A2). Further studies to isolate and sequence more clade A strains in humans and camels may provide insights on the role of clade A strains in MERS-CoV evolution and the potential significance of the observed amino acid changes for host adaptation.",

            "text": "The present results show that recombination events are common among certain strains of MERS-CoV. Recombination is a wellrecognized mechanism by which CoVs generate diversity. We have previously described recombination among the three human CoV HKU1 genotypes, and other human or animal coronaviruses, 21, 37, 38 and other researchers have also found recombination in coronaviruses such as feline coronavirus type II and infectious bronchitis virus. 39 15 showed inconsistent phylogenetic clustering in trees based on different viral genes ( Figure 3 ). However, bootscan analysis and multiple alignments did not reveal evidence of recombination for strain D2731.3/14 ( Figure 4B ). Only strains D1271/15 (from Dubai) and D1189.1/15 (from Umm Al Quwain) showed evidence of a likely recombination event after stepwise examination using phylogenetic analysis, bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments (Figure 4a ). It is also important to note that the nucleotide sequences of all MERS-CoV genomes are 499% identical. Therefore, even for the strains with possible recombination, there are only approximately 10 base pair differences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination site between the 'recombinant' and 'parent' strains. Although these sequence differences may have arisen through recombination, they may also have resulted from individual nucleotide mutations. Further studies with careful interpretation of recombination analysis results will be important to understand the role of recombination in the emergence and evolution of MERS-CoV.",

Every year, these camels were brought to Saudi Arabia for 6 months because of the better grazing conditions due to the higher amount of rainfall in Saudi Arabia than in Dubai. The dromedary calves from this herd were born in Saudi Arabia. Young dromedaries are usually removed from the herd and start their training as racing camels when they are one year old. Although this MERS-CoV was most probably acquired in Saudi Arabia, its genome sequence is closely related to two human MERS-CoV strains from Oman (KT156560) and Abu Dhabi (KP209312), respectively(Figure 2). The MERS-CoV isolated from the dromedary in Umm Al Quwain (D1189.1/15) is closely related to D1271/15 in this study and to a human MERS-CoV strain isolated in Thailand (KT225476)(Figure 2).
