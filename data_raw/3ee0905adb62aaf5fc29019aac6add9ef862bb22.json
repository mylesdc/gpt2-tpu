The precipitant was resuspended with 1 ml Tris-NaCl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). The resuspended virus (1 ml) was loaded onto a 10%~60% (w/v) step sucrose gradient (total 9.6 ml, 1.6 mL/layer) and centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 \u00b0C. Viral particles were collected from the interface between 20% and 30% sucrose layers. The collection was diluted with the Tris-NaCl buffer.",

Particles of bad class averages were discarded and 22,060 good particles were used for the 3D auto-refinement. To validate the accuracy of the reconstructions, we did the refinement and reconstruction with both EMAN2 and RELION1.4 using the same low-pass filtered initial model and same particle dataset. Both 3D refinements were performed following a ''gold standard'' procedure, wherein the raw data were randomly divided into two subsets that were then refined independently. The resolution was 25 \u00c5 at Fourier shell correlation value 0.5 and 19 \u00c5 at Fourier shell correlation value 0.143.
