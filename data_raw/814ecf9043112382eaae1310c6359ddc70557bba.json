The guided discussion technique 4 aimed to elicit dialogue and exchanges between the assessors and participants, to review procedures and interdepartmental interactions and to analyse the functionality of the health emergency systems. Discussions continued with technical leaders during visits to specific settings: the country's major international airport and its Ebola virus disease reference hospital and reference laboratory (1 day). We dedicated a half day to train the joint assessment team members and another half day to present preliminary findings to the same audience for clarification and to reach consensus (1 day). The final results and recommendations were summarized in the form of a report and presented to the health authorities of the country on the last day of the visit (1 day). WHO committed to monitoring the implementation of the recommendations.",

Points of entry. Each assessment component comprised several Objective To conduct assessments of Ebola virus disease preparedness in countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region. Methods Nine of 11 countries in the region agreed to be assessed. During February to November 2015 a joint team from WHO and ministries of health conducted 4-5 day missions to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. We collected information through guided discussions with senior technical leaders and visits to hospitals, laboratories and airports. We assessed each country's Ebola virus disease preparedness on 41 tasks under nine key components adapted from the WHO Ebola preparedness checklist of January 2015. Findings Political commitment to Ebola preparedness was high in all countries. Planning was most advanced for components that had been previously planned or tested for influenza pandemics: multilevel and multisectoral coordination; multidisciplinary rapid response teams; public communication and social mobilization; drills in international airports; and training on personal protective equipment. Major vulnerabilities included inadequate risk assessment and risk communication; gaps in data management and analysis for event surveillance; and limited capacity in molecular diagnostic techniques. Many countries had limited planning for a surge of Ebola cases. Other tasks needing improvement included: advice to inbound travellers; adequate isolation rooms; appropriate infection control practices; triage systems in hospitals; laboratory diagnostic capacity; contact tracing; and danger pay to staff to ensure continuity of care. Conclusion Joint assessment and feedback about the functionality of Ebola virus preparedness systems help countries strengthen their core capacities to meet the International Health Regulations. Functionality of tasks was scored as follows: no structure in place or activities not addressed (score 0); activities planned but not implemented (score 1); activities in place but low evidence of functionality (score 2); or complete response, i.e.",

Each task addressed one of the three aspects of preparedness: what activities are currently operational for handling the threat of Ebola virus disease (currently functional activities); how prepared the country is for the introduction of an Ebola virus disease case (operational readiness); and how prepared the country is to face a wider outbreak of Ebola virus (surge capacity; Table 1 ). Core questions were prepared to trigger guided discussion and contextual questions about the tasks (available from the corresponding author). To standardize analysis across countries and facilitate discussion between the joint assessment team members we scored the functionality of each task from 0 to 3: no structure in place or activities not addressed (score 0); activities planned but not implemented (score 1); activities in place but with low evidence of functionality (score 2); or complete response, i.e. evidence of fully functional activities and readiness or planning for surge capacity (score 3; Table 1 ). Readiness of a structure that was already in place was assessed on the level of training as follows: low evidence of functionality, when simple training such as a lecture or demonstration was carried out (score 2); or high evidence of functionality, if simulations were conducted regularly and reported to be followed by improvements (score 3). High surge capacity was defined as evidence of surge planning in terms of sufficient enrolment of trained staff and adequate space and supplies. 5 Our assessments were based on documented evidence or participants' descriptions of procedures.",

Of these, most had conducted a risk assessment only once at the early phase of preparedness, rather than as a continuous evaluation, and most relied on the results of the regular WHO global risk assessments in which country-specific recommendations are limited. Only Sri Lanka and Thailand used risk assessment for preparedness by identifying several scenarios of Ebola virus disease to be addressed in the preparedness process.

Planning was triggered in all countries after WHO declared Ebola virus disease as a public health emergency of international concern in 2014. The Ebola preparedness plans tended to rely on generic structures previously established for influenza pandemics in the countries. 7 Effectiveness in implementing Ebola virus disease preparedness can therefore be interpreted as a return on investment in IHR capacities. 8 This underscores the fundamental importance of the IHR mechanism for global health security.",

This was due to several factors: slow collection of data from a limited number of sites; no case-based, immediate reporting mechanism; and limited capacity to process and analyse data. Further investments in automated surveillance that rapidly collects and analyses large amounts of data may be needed. 16 Fifth, most countries had not attempted to introduce molecular techniques for Ebola virus disease diagnosis, even though they had PCR testing capacity for other viruses (e.g. MERScoronavirus or influenza viruses) and had laboratory capacity at the minimum biosecurity level for Ebola virus inactivation (biosafety level 2+ or 3). 17 In some of these countries, experience with a handful of suspected patients (later found to be negative) showed that patients' PCR results took 5-7 days to be returned from reference laboratories in other countries. This delay highlights a need for in-country capacity for Ebola virus disease diagnosis, supported by stand-by arrangements with global WHO collaborating centres. 17 Other challenges that needed improvement in the countries included several elements that were prominent in the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic: 3 advice to inbound travellers; adequate isolation rooms; appropriate infection control practices; emergency department triage systems in general hospitals; contact tracing; and danger pay to health-care workers to ensure continuity of care. Staff fears about Ebola virus contagion are important to address, as even the best plans can fail if there is absenteeism and disruptions in supporting services and supplies.",

Rather than evaluating and comparing countries, our joint WHO and health ministry approach aimed to help countries to prioritize and formally document their most urgent needs to enhance preparedness and response within their health security system. We appreciate that Sri Lanka has made the report publicly available, 18 which is one of the goals of the review. We hope that other countries are encouraged to use a similar transparent and constructive process whereby WHO and national participants work together in interactive sessions to reach a consensus with clear justifications. Transparency and consensus were adopted by WHO's joint external evaluation in 2016 to monitor IHR compliance and help attract and direct resources to where they are needed most. 19 This study has provided a general picture of comparative strengths and weaknesses across various aspects of Ebola disease preparedness that are also key components of the IHR core capacity requirements. Further strengthening of IHR capacities must involve testing the functionality of preparedness and response systems. An IHR monitoring and evaluation mechanism is needed that incorporates joint assessment processes, repeated simulation exercises and risk assessment processes that look into system vulnerabilities. Many countries have a limited ability to address every type of hazard or large-scale event. IHR-related planning should therefore include detailed stand-by arrangements between countries and with WHO on areas of vulnerability. \u25a0 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e. \u0412\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u042d\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c. \u041a \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447, \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435: \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0446, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b, \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0445, \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u043e\u0442\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438. \u0412\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441 \u0442\u0438 \u043a \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0435 \u042d\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b.",

M\u00e9todos Nueve de once pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n aceptaron ser evaluados. De febrero a noviembre de 2015, un equipo conjunto de la OMS y los ministerios de sanidad llevaron a cabo misiones de entre 4 y 5 d\u00edas en Bangladesh, But\u00e1n, Indonesia, Maldivas, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tailandia y Timor-Leste. Se recopil\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de conversaciones dirigidas con jefes t\u00e9cnicos y visitas a hospitales, laboratorios y aeropuertos. Se evalu\u00f3 la preparaci\u00f3n ante el virus del \u00c9bola de cada pa\u00eds en 41 tareas con 9 componentes clave adaptados de la lista de preparaci\u00f3n ante el \u00e9bola de la OMS de enero de 2015. Resultados El compromiso pol\u00edtico para la preparaci\u00f3n ante el \u00e9bola era elevado en todos los pa\u00edses. La planificaci\u00f3n era m\u00e1s avanzada para los componentes que hab\u00edan sido previamente planificados o probados para pandemias de gripe: coordinaci\u00f3n de varios niveles y sectores, equipos de respuesta r\u00e1pida multidisciplinares, comunicaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y movilizaci\u00f3n social, simulacros en aeropuertos internacionales y formaci\u00f3n sobre equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual. Entre las principales vulnerabilidades se encontraba una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos y comunicaci\u00f3n de riesgos poco adecuadas, lagunas en la gesti\u00f3n y el an\u00e1lisis de datos para el control de acontecimientos y una capacidad limitada en t\u00e9cnicas de diagn\u00f3stico molecular. Muchos pa\u00edses ten\u00edan una planificaci\u00f3n limitada en caso de que resurgieran casos de \u00e9bola. Entre otras tareas que necesitaban mejorar se encontraban: asesor\u00eda a viajeros entrantes, salas de aislamiento adecuadas, pr\u00e1cticas de control de infecciones adecuadas, sistemas de clasificaci\u00f3n en hospitales, capacidad de diagn\u00f3stico en laboratorios, localizaci\u00f3n de contactos y prima de peligrosidad para el personal para garantizar la continuidad de la atenci\u00f3n. Conclusi\u00f3n La evaluaci\u00f3n conjunta y los comentarios sobre la funcionalidad de los sistemas de preparaci\u00f3n ante el virus del \u00c9bola ayudan a los pa\u00edses a fortalecer sus capacidades principales para cumplir el Reglamento Sanitario Internacional.",

M\u00e9thodes Sur les 11 pays de la r\u00e9gion, neuf ont accept\u00e9 d' \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s. De f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 novembre 2015, une \u00e9quipe compos\u00e9e de membres de l'OMS et des minist\u00e8res de la Sant\u00e9 ont effectu\u00e9 des missions de 4 \u00e0 5 jours au Bangladesh, au Bhoutan, en Indon\u00e9sie, aux Maldives, au Myanmar, au N\u00e9pal, au Sri Lanka, en Tha\u00eflande et au Timor-Leste. Nous avons recueilli des informations lors de discussions guid\u00e9es avec des directeurs techniques et lors de visites dans des h\u00f4pitaux, des laboratoires et des a\u00e9roports. Nous avons \u00e9valu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9paration de chaque pays au virus Ebola d'apr\u00e8s 41 t\u00e2ches relevant de neuf composantes cl\u00e9s, inspir\u00e9es de la liste de contr\u00f4le de l'OMS pour faire face au virus Ebola de janvier 2015. R\u00e9sultats L'engagement politique en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9paration au virus Ebola \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans tous les pays. La planification \u00e9tait plus avanc\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis des composantes qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 planifi\u00e9es ou test\u00e9es pour les pand\u00e9mies de grippe: coordination multisectorielle et multi-niveaux, \u00e9quipes d'intervention rapide multidisciplinaires, communication publique et mobilisation sociale, exercices dans les a\u00e9roports internationaux et formation au port d'\u00e9quipements de protection individuelle. Les principales vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s \u00e9taient une mauvaise \u00e9valuation et communication des risques, des failles dans la gestion et l'analyse des donn\u00e9es en vue de la surveillance, et des capacit\u00e9s limit\u00e9es au niveau des techniques de diagnostic mol\u00e9culaire. Dans de nombreux pays, la planification \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e en cas de flamb\u00e9e du virus Ebola. D'autres t\u00e2ches n\u00e9cessitaient des am\u00e9liorations, par exemple: les conseils aux voyageurs entrant dans le pays, la mise \u00e0 disposition de chambres d'isolement ad\u00e9quates, l'adoption de pratiques correctes de lutte contre la maladie, des syst\u00e8mes de triage dans les h\u00f4pitaux, des capacit\u00e9s de diagnostic dans les laboratoires, la recherche des contacts et le paiement d'une prime de risque au personnel afin d'assurer la continuit\u00e9 des soins. Conclusion L' \u00e9valuation conjointe et la communication au sujet de la fonctionnalit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes de pr\u00e9paration au virus Ebola permettent aux pays de renforcer leurs capacit\u00e9s afin de respecter le R\u00e8glement sanitaire international.\u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a
