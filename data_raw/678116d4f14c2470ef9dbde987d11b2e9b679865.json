            "text": "We previously described that immunopotentiators, CVCVA5, increased the efficacy of H5 and H9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens, ducks, and geese. In this study, we further investigated the effects of the CVCVA5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines. The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The sterile protective immunity was monitored with one-or a half-dose of adjuvanted ND vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted IBD vaccine, respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H9). A half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75% antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H5 or H9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines given a booster with H5-H9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA5 using 5-day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 after the injection of the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines. Results indicated that the CVCVA5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine, and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine.",

These signal molecules can elicit a more robust immune response via activation of innate immune pathway (Coffman et al., 2010) . Various strategies have been adopted to increase the immunological efficacy of the inactivated viral emulsified vaccine, such as the addition of the immunopotentiators (Fox et al., 2013) . The adjuvant, CVCVA5, showed the effects on improving efficacy of both the serum and mucosal antibody response and the cell mediated immune response of inactivated vaccine in chickens (Tang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2016) . The components of CVCVA5 contain ligands to pattern recognition receptors, poly I:C, resiquimod, imiquimod, muramyldipeptide (MDP), and chemicals with immune enhancement activity, levamisole hydrochloride. The poly I:C is the ligand of toll-like-receptors (TLRs)-3 and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR). While the resiquimod, imiquimod are the ligands of TLR-7/8 (Vasilakos and Tomai, 2013) . The MDP is recognized by NOD-like receptors (NOD)-2 (Sonoda et al., 2000) . Levamisole is an antiparasitic agent and is also capable of immune enhancement (Oladele et al., 2012) .",

These polyvalent vaccines are widely adopted as one of the strategies to prevent and control the spread of infectious disease in intensive-farming of commercial poultry flocks. However, the manufacturing processes of polyvalent vaccines are more complicated than those of the monovalent vaccines, which involved from the steps of the filtration and concentration of single component of vaccine antigens to the preparation of aqueous phase before the emulsification with mineral oil phase. These processes yield of polyvalent vaccines containing more impure contents than those of the monovalent vaccines, leading to adverse effects on animal. Therefore, one of the challenges of the preparation of polyvalent vaccine is how to balance the reduction of antigen volume with the maintenance of the efficacy as those of the monovalent vaccine. The addition of adjuvants containing danger signals molecules to the vaccine is one effective method to overcome these drawbacks. The efficacy of the antigen-saving tetravalent with adjuvants is not influenced by the reduction of antigen contents. This indicated the adjuvants can benefit antigen-saving during manufacture process. The body weight and clinical signs showed no remarkable difference (data not shown) between the chickens in the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. This indicated no adverse effect of the adjuvant on their growth. Results also indicated that the CVCVA5 adjuvant is capable of increasing the efficacy of the vaccine with four antigens. The previous studies (Gough et al., 1977; Li et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2015) also showed the adjuvants can improve the efficacy of multivalent vaccines.",
