CMV infection can result in high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in immunocompromised patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies. The incidence of CMV pneumonia in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies has been reported to range from 2.3% to 16%, with an overall Clinical Research Paper mortality rate of 57%, which is increasing [3] . There are some literatures describing non-transplant patients with the risks of CMV pneumonia such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma, use of rituximab, systemic steroid, alemtuzumab or busulfan [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Development of immunosuppressive agents and increased use of CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or serum would have increased the incidence of CMV pneumonia in non-transplant patients with hematologic malignancies. However, diagnostic methods for CMV pneumonia have not undergone marked development in the past few decades [9] . Definitive diagnosis of CMV pneumonia is determined based on a combination of symptoms and signs of pulmonary disease and detection of CMV in BAL fluid or lung tissue samples by virus isolation, histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis or in in situ hybridization [1, 2] .",

Baseline characteristics of the patients and prior treatments are shown in Table 2 . The mean age was 48 \u00b1 3.0 years, and 75% of the patients were male. The most common underlying hematologic diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (25.0%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (16.7%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (12.5%) and aplastic anemia (12.5%). Sixteen (66.7%) patients were using immunosuppressant agents at the time of diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, and 12 (46.2%) had received systemic chemotherapy-including alemtuzumab in 2 and steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone >1 mg/ kg/day) in 3 (12.5%)-due to aggravation of GVHD in the last 30 days. All 24 patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia were treated with antiviral agents, which resulted in aggravation of pneumonia in 14 (58.3%) and improvement in 10 (41.7%) patients.

Seven (46.7%) patients were co-infected by 4 bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenophomonas maltophilia and Mycoplasma), 3 (20.0%) by 3 viruses (coronavirus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus), 3 (20.0%) by 2 fungi (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus niger) and 2 (13.3%) by Mycobacterium species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterium). Table 3 shows the transplantation characteristics of the patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia. Of the 24 diagnosed patients, 16 had undergone BMT. The mean time to diagnosis of CMV pneumonia after BMT was 167.7 \u00b1 60.9 days; however, the majority of the patients (n=11, 68.8%) were diagnosed <100 days after BMT.

In all of these patients, CMV pneumonia was diagnosed during the late period, 100 days (range 215-1006 days, data not shown) after BMT. The most frequent donors were siblings, and two patients had undergone auto-transplantations. Figure 2 shows the distribution of CMV qRT-PCR viral load in bronchial washing fluid. The median log 10 (CMV qRT-PCR copies/mL) values were 5.3 (range, 3.56-8. 19 ) in patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia (n=24) and 3.4 (range 2.7-5.05) in those who were not diagnosed with CMV pneumonia (n=70); this difference was significant (P < 0.001). Table 4 shows the qRT-PCR results of patients with (n = 24) versus without a diagnosis of CMV pneumonia (n = 70). The median CMV loads in bronchial washing fluid were significantly different between the two groups (with vs. without CMV pneumonia: 1.8 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL vs. 3.0 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001).

Patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia had significantly higher qRT-PCR CMV titers than did those with findings inconsistent with CMV pneumonia, both in bronchial washing fluid (61-fold higher) and whole blood (6-fold higher). Moreover, using the ROC curve, a cut-off value of 28,774 copies/ml (sensitivity 75%; specificity 88.6%) CMV DNA in bronchial washing fluid was correlated with CMV pneumonia. As the prevalence of CMV pneumonia in our BMT center is 0.85% -0.86% [13] , the positive and negative predictive values were 5.3% and 99.8% respectively. Our data is valuable in that for the first time we have provided optimal cut point of CMV DNA in patients with hematologic malignancies. This result will help clinicians to diagnose CMV pneumonia more easily in patients with hematologic malignancy. Although pathologic confirmation is gold standard for diagnosis, lung biopsy usually carries high risk of bleeding in patients with hematologic malignancies. Our data suggests that non-invasive bronchial washing procedure may replace invasive lung biopsy in the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia in these patients. Also our cut off points of CMV qRT-PCR could be supplementary information for the early detection of CMV in pulmonary infiltrates of patients with hematologic malignancies.",

Cathomas et al. reported that among 75 patients, 7 (9.3%) had CMV pneumonia and 6 (8%) had CMV infection without pneumonia; a PCR assay showed 100% sensitivity [2] . The relatively low specificity (93.5%) and positive predictive value (58.3%) were compensated for by the additional performance of CMV immunostaining, which resulted in a 100% positive predictive value and 100% specificity. Hohenthal et al. reported that among 135 BAL fluid samples from patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with pneumonia from 1996 to 2002, CMV PCR was positive in 18 (13.4%), 4 (22.2%) of which were obtained from patients with definite or probable CMV pneumonia. However, the significance of the positive PCR findings was unknown in 14 (77.8%) patients [24] . Since then, no study on the feasibility of CMV detection by PCR using BAL fluid from patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies has been reported. In lung transplant recipients, Chemaly's et al. [17] had described the viral cut-off from BAL fluid as 500,000 copies/mL. This viral cut-off is quite different from ours; however, we assume that this discrepancy could have been driven by different host immune status and the much smaller study population in Chemaly's study. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no other study has evaluated use of a qPCR method to discriminate CMV pneumonia from CMV infection. Our study is unique in terms of its use of qRT-PCR to enable a quantitative comparison and inclusion of a considerably larger population than those of previous works.",

            "text": "This study had several limitations. First, 10 patients in whom CMV infection was not proven by lung biopsy or culture were included in the ROC curve analysis. This clinical diagnosis of CMV pneumonia is debatable, but an experienced specialist excluded patients with other etiologies of infection and non-infectious conditions from the analysis by means of a strict review. As a result, all patients were treated with anti-CMV agents and/or CMV immunoglobulin, and none improved spontaneously without antiviral agents. Also, the percentage of diagnosed specimens among the studied samples was 4.2%, in the range of the values reported by Cathoma (8.3%) [2] and Hohenthal (3.0%) [24] . Second, among the 24 diagnosed patients, 8 had not undergone BMT prior to diagnosis of CMV pneumonia. Because our center has been conducting risk-adapted pre-emptive therapy after BMT since 2000 according to BMT type and GVHD grade [12, 25, 26] , four patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia had histories of pre-emptive therapy after BMT. Since strategies to prevent CMV pneumonia and diagnosis in non-BMT patients with hematologic malignancies remain to be determined [3, [27] [28] [29] , none of the eight non-BMT patients had histories of pre-emptive therapy for CMV disease. We separately analyzed the ROC curves of CMV titers with reference to BMT status. The viral cut-off was 18,900 copies/mL (137,970 IU/mL) in post-BMT patients and 316,415 copies/mL (2,309,825 IU/mL) in no-BMT patients. The viral cut-off of no-BMT patients was much higher than that of post-BMT patients; this difference is clinically relevant. Due to the long-term immune suppression required post-BMT and transfer of virus from seropositive donors, whether or not a patient underwent BMT influences the risk of CMV reactivation to end-organ disease. We found that exclusion of no-BMT patients made little difference to the determined cut-offs level, which decreased from 28,774 copies/mL (210,054 IU/mL) to 18,900 copies/mL (137,970 IU/mL). However, only 16 post-BMT patients were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia in present study; this small number may have compromised the accuracies of the ROC curves. CMV titers determined by qRT-PCR should be analyzed according to BMT status and risk of CMV disease in a larger population to obtain statistically significant data. Moreover, the cut-offs level should be validated prospectively derived from and at the same time applied to the same dataset. Third, pulmonary hemorrhage may be in play; the viral load in BAL may reflect CMV reactivation in blood. We identified 3 patients with pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage among the 24 diagnosed with CMV pneumonia, and 1 case of hemorrhage among the 70 patients not diagnosed with CMV pneumonia. In the ROC curve drawn after exclusion of patients who possibly had pulmonary hemorrhages, the viral cut-off value was 19.420 copies/mL (185,682 IU/mL) (AUC 0.923 \u00b1 0.031, 95% CI 0.863-0.983; P < 0.001: sensitivity 83.8%, specificity 65.6%). Thus, the exclusion of patients with pulmonary hemorrhages created only minimal interval changes in the cut-off values, possibly because the blood CMV titers were low in such patients (data now shown). Lastly, we also reviewed the effect of antiviral treatment prior to bronchoscopy. Two such patients were identified; they had been pre-emptively treated with ganciclovir under suspicion of CMV reactivation upon examination of blood CMV PCR titers. However, the intervals between the commencement of the antiviral agent and bronchoscopy were relatively short, (11 and 5 days); any effect would be expected to be minimal.",
