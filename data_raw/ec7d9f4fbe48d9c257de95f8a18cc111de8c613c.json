The recognition of these peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T-cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer, which leverage this mechanism, can greatly benefit from structural analyses of pMHC complexes. Several attempts have been made to use molecular docking for such analyses, but pMHC structure remains too challenging for even state-of-the-art docking tools. To overcome these limitations, we describe the use of an incremental meta-docking approach for structural prediction of pMHC complexes. Previous methods applied in this context used specific constraints to reduce the complexity of this prediction problem, at the expense of generality. Our strategy makes no assumption and can potentially be used to predict binding modes for any pMHC complex. Our method has been tested in a re-docking experiment, reproducing the binding modes of 25 pMHC complexes whose crystal structures are available. This study is a proof of concept that incremental docking strategies can lead to general geometry prediction of pMHC complexes, with potential applications for immunotherapy against cancer or infectious diseases.",

Therefore, docking methods implement various heuristics to efficiently explore the ligand's conformational space and quickly find a low-energy docked conformation of the ligand. For that, binding mode prediction is guided by approximated binding energy calculations (through what is called a scoring function) 21 . Ideally, a docking tool should also be general, in the sense that the accuracy of the predictions should not be impacted by the type of protein receptor or the class of ligands. However, docking methods are known to be much less reliable when applied to larger ligands (e.g., ligands with more than 10 internal DoFs) 22, 23 . For instance, peptides are known to be very flexible ligands 24 ; binding mode prediction of even small peptides, composed of up to 5 amino acids (which means around 24 internal DoFs), can be particularly challenging for available docking methods 25, 26 . This limitation makes the structural prediction of pMHC complexes an impossible task for most docking tools, since a typical MHC-binder is a peptide composed of 8 to 11 amino acids (which translates to more than 30 internal DoFs).",

For instance, some methods focus on docking the two terminal residues of the peptide, resolving the central portion later 13, 14 . Others first approximate the backbone conformation, and then predict the side chains of the peptide 12, [33] [34] [35] . To make these divisions and approximations, these methods require ad-hoc constraints and are usually tailored towards specific MHC allotypes. There also exist methods relying on steps of molecular dynamics (MD) 36, 37 . MD can be useful to explore near native conformations of side-chains, but its higher computational cost makes it a less attractive solution for efficient exploration of the entire peptide conformational space 38 . An attempt at a more efficient and yet general solution made use of grid potentials and a biased-probability Monte Carlo method 14 , implemented in the Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) docking tool 39 . This method uses an MHC-specific scoring function trained on available crystal structures via statistical learning. Despite promising results on a small number of known pMHC complexes, the choice of a more specific scoring function and the assumptions on the location of the peptide's terminal amino acid residues raise questions about the generality of the method towards less prevalent MHC allotypes.",

The authors used available crystal structures of pMHCs as template for peptide backbone conformations, manually positioning the side chains of anchor residues in the expected locations within the binding site. This is justified by the fact that some peptide amino acid residues are known to stabilize the binding by interacting with deeper pockets in the MHC cleft 41 . Then, they conducted a backbone optimization step, followed by side chain prediction. Interestingly, good results were obtained for 5 selected allotypes, even when the template was from a different allotype. However, all reported examples involved complexes that had similar backbone conformations. In addition, the use of backbone templates and assumptions on the position of anchor residues represent important limitations of this method, since they might differ across different groups of MHC allotypes 35, 42 . Even for a given MHC allotype, the peptide backbone changes significantly depending on its length. There is also evidence of peptides presenting alternative anchors 42, 43 or unusual binding modes 44 . The FlexPepDock refinement protocol was only applied to 9-mer peptides and a limited number of MHC allotypes. Therefore, it is not yet clear how general this method can be, with respect to these limitations.",

With the aim of developing a general tool for de novo pMHC geometry prediction, in this paper we describe a proof of concept study using an incremental meta-docking approach referred to as DINC (Docking INCrementally) 23 . DINC was previously developed by our group to predict the binding modes of peptidomimetic inhibitors 57 , based on a divide and conquer approach. In contrast to the methods described above, DINC makes no assumption on the location of particular amino acid residues or the shape of the peptide backbone. To evaluate DINC's applicability and generality in the context of prevalent human MHC allotypes, we performed a re-docking experiment on a diverse dataset of 25 pMHC complexes with available crystal structures. DINC was able to reproduce the binding modes of these complexes with an average error of 1.92 \u00c5. Our results also show the ability of this incremental method to reproduce non-standard binding modes. Finally, we discuss the benefits of having a general tool for pMHC geometry prediction in the growing field of cancer immunotherapy.",

Also, in cases of duplicated side chains (i.e., conformational heterogeneity), the subset with lower occupancy was removed. Finally, in cases of multiple molecules per asymmetric unit only the first subset was kept (e.g., chains A, B and C). Revised structures were then submitted to a three steps energy minimization with GROMACS v4.6.5 60 , using the steepest-descent and conjugate gradient methods. The GROMOS96 (53a6) force field was used with the SPC water model; a cutoff value of 1.2 nm was used for both van der Waals and Coulomb interactions, with Fast Particle-Mesh Ewald electrostatics (PME). After this procedure, water molecules were removed from the output files and the coordinates of the minimized complexes were saved into PDB format files. These minimized crystal structures will be hereafter referred to as \"reference structures\": they are the structures we aim to reproduce in this re-docking experiment.

When computing the RMSD for all atoms of a peptide, between a predicted complex and its reference structure, the two pMHC complexes are first aligned based on the MHC structure. Therefore, the all-atom RMSD captures not only differences in conformation between the two binding modes, but also differences in position of the peptide inside the MHC cleft. While the all-atom RMSD captures changes in both the main chain and the side chains of the peptide, the C\u03b1 RMSD (i.e., RMSD for alpha carbons only) captures only changes in the main chain. Another goodness-of-fit measure is the Least Root Mean Square Deviation (LRMSD), computed after aligning the two peptide structures (as opposed to aligning the two MHC structures), either for all atoms or alpha carbons only. The LRMSD is a more precise evaluation of differences between two conformations of a peptide, irrespective of its position in the MHC cleft. DINC algorithm. DINC is a parallelized meta-docking method for incremental docking of large ligands, described in detail in previous publications 23, 61 . Briefly, instead of docking the entire peptide at once, DINC starts by docking only a small fragment of the peptide (Fig. 2) . The best conformation for this \"initial fragment\" is selected using a scoring function, and expanded through the addition of another subset of atoms from the original peptide. This new expanded fragment is then docked, and this process is incrementally repeated until the entire peptide is reconstructed and docked. Note that the word \"fragment\" is used here with a different meaning than that of fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). FBDD uses libraries of fragments, which are very small molecules with no more than two functional groups 62 , to create new drugs or drug-like ligands. DINC was inspired by these methods, but does not use any library of small molecules, and does not dock independent fragments that are later connected. In the context of DINC, the fragments are overlapping sections of the input ligand, docked sequentially to grow the ligand incrementally 61 .",

This protocol represents a reasonable selection of parameter values for a standard job, but it is not expected to provide the best results in all situations. Therefore, in our re-docking experiment, four alternative protocols were defined, exploring other combinations of parameter values. The specific parameter values in these five protocols (including the default protocol) are presented in Supplementary Table S2 . It is important to highlight that we do not exhaustively evaluate all possible protocols.

It is the second most prevalent allotype in humans 67, 68 and arguably the HLA variant for which the most detailed and comprehensive data is available: more than 42,000 binding assays deposited in the Immune Epitope Database 69 . As reported in previous studies, HLA-A*02:01 binds mostly 9-mers, but also larger peptides. It was also reported that the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is fairly constrained, with little conformational variation across available crystal structures. It also presents a clear pattern of preferred anchor residues 41 at both peptide termini: usually positions 2 (p2) and 9 (p9) of the 9-mer ligands (Fig. 5) . Comparing available crystal structures, a shared conformational pattern was observed for the backbone of 9-mer peptides bound to HLA-A*02:01 35 . For example, this typical backbone pattern is observed in the crystal structure 3MRG, involving a virus-derived peptide (Fig. 5A) . Some cancer-related peptides, however, are known to present unusual binding modes 17 . For instance, in the modified melanoma-associated antigen MART1-A27L the amino-terminal anchor to the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is p1 instead of p2. This alternative anchoring pattern creates a sideways deviation of the backbone in the middle of the peptide 17 , resulting in an unusual binding mode (Fig. 5B, 2GTW ). In addition, larger peptides are known to present bulging conformations of the backbone, to accommodate a longer chain using the same anchoring pockets (Fig. 5A, 1I4F) . DINC was able to reproduce each one of these 3 alternative backbone conformations, with sub-angstrom accuracy (Fig. 6) .",

Currently, there are only two crystal structures of 9-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02, and they present different binding modes (Fig. 5C) . According to the researchers who described these structures, the virus-derived peptide resolved in 3I6L shows an unusual binding mode, with a much more exposed p4 as compared to a regular self-derived peptide (2BCK). Further analysis of other crystal structures shows that the backbone conformation seen in 3I6L is very similar to that of 10-mer peptides bound to the same HLA (data not shown). In our re-docking experiment, DINC was able to reproduce all these binding modes (Fig. 6) , as well as other 10-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02 (Supplementary Table S1 ). In the case of 3I6L, the authors claim that the observed binding mode is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond established by p3, whose side chain is pointing towards the center of the binding cleft. The binding mode predicted by DINC for this complex does not feature this specific hydrogen bond (as determined by UCSF Chimera), but a similar orientation of p3 is observed (Fig. 6F) .",

Unfortunately, unexpected off-target toxicities against healthy tissues have been reported [74] [75] [76] , raising serious safety concerns. For instance, lethal cardiac toxicity was observed in two patients undergoing treatment with T-cells specific to the MAGEA3 antigen 74, 75 . Later investigation showed that the therapeutic T-cells used in these patients were also recognizing an unrelated Titin-derived peptide, displayed by HLA-A*01:01 molecules in healthy cardiac cells 74, 75 .",

Each TCR is thought to be specific for a given pMHC complex, but structural similarity between unrelated complexes can be responsible for off-target activation of T-cells 8, 77 ; also known as T-cell cross-reactivity 6 . Using x-ray crystallography, Raman and colleagues 10 have confirmed the structural similarity between the pMHC complexes involved in the MAGEA3-Titin cross-reactivity (Fig. 7A,B) . Both of these pMHC complexes were included in our dataset (5BRZ and 5BS0). DINC was able to correctly predict the geometry of both peptides, bound to HLA-A*01:01, and reproduce the structural similarity of the resulting TCR-interacting surfaces (Fig. 7D,E) . The clinically relevant example described above highlights the significance of pMHC structural prediction in the context of T-cell-based immunotherapy. In this case, the two peptides have a sequence identity of 55%, which is already challenging for sequence-based cross-reactivity prediction. However, T-cell cross-reactivity can be triggered even by peptides with no sequence identity and low biochemical similarity 78 , and might be driven by specific structural similarities in hot-spots over the TCR-interacting surface 79 . In this context, structure-based methods for cross-reactivity prediction have been proposed, either clustering pMHCs of interest based on structural similarity 78, 80 , or integrating structural information and protein expression levels into sequence-based proteomic searches 81, 82 . This field will spawn significant developments in the coming years, particularly considering the importance of cross-reactivity prediction for T-cell-based immunotherapy 11 . Moreover, considering the costs and practical limitations of experimental methods for protein structural analysis, fast and reliable computational methods for geometry prediction of pMHC complexes should play an important role in this process.

Algorithmic solutions to address this challenge are usually non-deterministic, introducing variability, which affects reproducibility. For instance, a single run of AutoDock 4 starts with a random conformation of the ligand, which is then randomly modified by the Lamarckian genetic algorithm to create new conformations 20, 63 . Therefore, the chances of obtaining different results in independent runs of AutoDock 4 increase with ligand size. A similar variability is observed across independent DINC jobs. However, this is not a problem here, as our goal was only to determine if DINC could predict different binding modes of pMHC complexes within a reasonable time. By providing a proof of concept that this goal is indeed attainable, we can now open new avenues for developing even better algorithms inspired by the meta-docking incremental approach. In fact, since only a few protocols were used in the context of this study, there is great potential for further improvement. As future work, we will perform a thorough evaluation of the parameters and heuristics in DINC in order to improve its efficiency and achieve fast, accurate and reproducible geometry prediction of pMHC complexes.",

Here, we focused on the peptide-docking problem, and showed how a simple incremental approach allows predicting binding modes of peptides with different lengths and bound to different MHCs. For that, we limited our analysis to a re-docking experiment involving a diverse dataset of human pMHCs. Receptor flexibility is another important challenge 27 and should be taken into consideration when predicting pMHC complexes 83 . In fact, MHC flexibility can affect peptide loading, and peptide binding can induce local changes in the MHC receptor 84, 85 . However, the folding of MHC receptors is highly-conserved. Therefore, a docking protocol accounting for receptor flexibility could be combined with homology modeling to predict the binding modes of peptides to MHC allotypes for which no structural information is available 14, 16 . However, the high-dimensionality of the resulting search space requires even better algorithms, which may involve dimensionality reduction approaches 86 .",

In fact, scoring is one of the bottlenecks when trying to achieve greater accuracy in docking-based methods 26 . In terms of sampling, our method could certainly provide results with sub-angstrom accuracy, but this would require a scoring function capable of discriminating between conformations with sub-angstrom differences. Therefore, our method could benefit from using consensus scoring 87 , peptide-specific scoring 88 or HLA-specific scoring 89 . Being a meta-docking application, DINC can integrate alternative sampling strategies or scoring methods. We plan to further investigate these issues in a future study, performing cross-docking and benchmarking on a much larger pMHC dataset.",

DINC do not require ad-hoc knowledge on the typical binders for a given MHC allotype, or its preferred primary anchors.

Standard docking software can provide general solutions (i.e., solutions that are not restricted to a particular protein receptor), but cannot handle large ligands. On the other hand, methods focused on pMHC structural prediction lack generality because they often use expert-knowledge or frequent patterns as constraints. We argue that the use of incremental docking offers a new strategy to overcome these limitations. Our work shows that incremental docking allows handling different MHC allotypes, predicting unusual binding modes, and obtaining accurate structural prediction for peptides with up to 41 rotatable bonds. In addition, being a meta-docking approach, our method avoids the need for new docking software. We postulate that a similar incremental process could be implemented using different docking software, achieving similar or even better results. As a proof of concept, our study represents a landmark in the advancement of methods for geometry prediction of pMHC complexes. Future developments of these methods are expected to have a positive impact in many fields related to human health, including vaccine development and tissue transplantation. In particular, fast and accurate prediction of patient-specific pMHC complexes will be key for the development of safe and effective T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer.",

DINC starts by selecting a small fragment of the peptide (top left), with only 6 DoFs (depicted in green), and using it as input for the first round of docking to the MHC binding cleft (cross-section view depicted in gray). The best binding modes are selected across multiple parallel docking runs, and the corresponding peptide fragments are expanded by adding a small number of atoms (depicted in red, top center). These expanded fragments are used as input for the second round of docking (top center), in which a new set of 6 flexible DoFs is considered flexible. These flexible DoFs involve some of the \"new\" atoms (in red) and some of the atoms that were already present in the previous fragment (in blue). This process continues until the entire ligand has been reconstructed and docked (bottom right).
