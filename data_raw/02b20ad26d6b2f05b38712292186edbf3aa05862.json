There has been a flurry of activity in the recent year on the subject of forecasting infectious disease outbreaks. Researchers have studied a diverse set of methods that range from classical methods in forecasting time series, to the use of sophisticated mechanistic models. Progress has also been made on the data front wherein diverse data sets have been collected and investigated in terms of their utility to forecast infectious disease dynamics. Recent progress has also been made using ensemble techniques to improve the quality of forecasting. Results have primarily been computational in nature and have shown that forecasting infectious disease might often be possible. In contrast to this, very little work has been undertaken to establish the inherent limits on forecasting.",

The main findings of the study are that the predictability depends upon the time horizon, the type of disease, and that the model structure and the structure of social networking explain most of the differences in predictability. Furthermore the authors stretch the need for developing efficient dynamic modeling approaches that will enhance our forecasting capability. The manuscript reads well and is generally well structured. It targets on a yet unsolved problem that of the efficient prediction of infectious disease dynamics. Having said that, I do not see the novelty in the methodology or in the main findings of the study that would support a publication in Nature Communications.",

The authors should consider using symbols like stars triangles etc. The same holds also for the confidence intervals of predictability (at what level?) which are not distinguishable. 2. Figure 2 : For the case of Zika (?), in contrast to the other infectious diseases, it seems that there is an \"optimal\" value of the predicting horizon that is followed with its sharp decrease. The authors do not (should) comment on this in the text. 3. For many systems the permutation entropy has been shown to be equivalent to the Kolmolgorov-Sinai entropy. A comparison between the two metrics would enhance the presentation of the work. 4. It would be interesting to show a comparison between the permutation entropy and the weighted permutation entropy (Fadlallah, et al. ,2013, Phys. Rev. E 87, 02291). 5. The analysis is post-hoc. For the implementation of the proposed methodology in real emerging situations the values of the two parameters, i.e. the embedding dimension and the embedding delay are not known a-priori and the analysis of past data does not guarantee their validity for the future. Mutations of the virus, changes in contact transmission network etc may change the embedding parameters and hence our forecasting ability. 6. The authors highlight the need for constructing efficient dynamic network models. However they don't present how in a systematic way how one can construct this link between the concept of permutation entropy and dynamic models. 7. The authors have to present better the SIR model and its parameters for the results to be reproducible. Also the algorithm of the network construction is missing. Response to reviewer #1 1.)

In this study, our goal was to find conservative values of H p by searching over a wide range of possible (d, \u03c4 ) pairs and setting H p ({x t }) = min d,\u03c4 H p d,\u03c4 ({x t }). However, the value of H p should always decline as the embedding dimension d grows, i.e. no minimum value of H p will exist for finite windows sizes N . To address this issue, we follow Brandmaier (2015) and exclude all unobserved symbols when calculating H p , which acts as a \"penalty\" against higher dimensions and results in a minimum value of H p for finite length time series. To control for differences in dimension and for the effect of time series length on the entropy estimation, we normalize the entropy by log(d!), ensure that each window is greater in length than d!, and confirm that the estimate of H p has stabilized (specifically that the marginal change in H p as data are added is less than 1%). To facilitate interpretation, we present results from continuous intervals by fixing \u03c4 = 1. However, our results generalize to the case where we fix both d and \u03c4 across all diseases and where we minimize over a range of (d, \u03c4 ) pairs (see Supplement).\"",

As they state, they are computing the minimum permutation entropy over a series of stroboscopic samplings of the data. Therefore their predictability measure is of the most predictable sub-sampling of the system, and not of the system as a whole. For example, if a signal consisted of white noise except every 10th value were exactly 0, the predictability would be 1. Therefore it is vastly more accurate to characterize the results of this work as an upper bound on predictability.",

Trivially, without penalizing the entropy calculation, for a finite-length time series the entropy will always decrease with increasing dimension. The issue of decreasing entropy with increasing dimension is why we consider the choice of the minimum entropy dimension as a strength of our methodology. Specifically, our approach allows one to identify the size of the blocks over which the maximum predictability can be expected. Additionally, and as detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we performed three distinct kinds of data sampling, using two variations on the permutation entropy (weighted and unweighted) and obtained the same qualitative results.",

If the mean of the white noise was zero and the variance was small, e.g., \u00b5 = 0, sd = 1, then the predictability for a white noise time series with every 10th value set to 0 would be equivalent to a white noise time series. This is because the time series would be equally likely to be above or below the 10th value, meaning the entropy over the symbols would be equivalent. If instead, we set the 10th value to 100 (or -100), but kept the white noise at \u00b5 = 0, sd = 1, then the predictability would be higher (because the time series would almost certainly be above -100 or below 100). We demonstrate this in the figure below. figure 4B the Kullback-Leibler divergence of... something is plotted. To the best of my knowledge this plot is primarily vacuous. It is not stated precisely what pairs of windows are compared and in which order. Due to the asymmetry of the DKL, there is no basis for using it to compare distributions of disease cases at different times. If the goal of this plot is to describe how different the distributions can be at different points within the time series, a better method to quantifying this would be to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence, or perhaps the Earth mover distance.",

However, we are the first to demonstrate the presence of entropy barriers to disease forecasting in a broad, comparative framework and to begin evaluating plausible mechanisms for the emergence of such barriers against empirical data. In particular, our result that permutation entropy is able to distinguish pre-and post-vaccine eras for measles time series is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of shifting model structure being detected with permutation entropy for any ecological time series. It's also worth noting that the proposed methodology for selecting optimal embedding dimensions, which was a critical barrier to using permutation entropy, 1. Here, we simulated four different time series and calculate the predictability (1-H) from 1,000 random starting points in each time series. The first, white noise (light gray) contains 5000 random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution with \u00b5 = 0, sd = 1. The remaining three time series contain exactly the same random numbers as in the white noise time series, i.e. we do not resample, but every 10th value is set to either -100 (blue), 0 (black), or 100 (red). and the results demonstrating that permutation entropy was associated with established metrics for predictability and entropy in dynamics systems were both published in 2015.

Another crucial observation is that while this universal behaviour is common across diseases, what is not common is the heterogeneity across different temporal windows for different time series signaling, which again we believe is a genuine novel contribution. We agree with the Reviewer that heterogeneity has a known effect on the predictability horizon of disease spreading. However, to-date the evidence for the effect of heterogeneity has either come from simulation studies or from studies dependent on a particular model structure. Our work advances from these early efforts by identifying barriers using a model-independent approach, i.e. permutation entropy, and by doing so in a comparative framework. Specifically, we observe that the permutation entropy rate production can be described in terms of two distinct parameters, one disease-specific (R 0 ), the other emerging dynamically from our optimization of the permutation entropy embedding dimension, which then provides a data-driven predictability horizon. Further, we show that it is not only structural heterogeneity but also dynamical and biological variability that can result in decreased predictability (e.g. the vaccination example and the temporal network simulations).",

Mutations of the virus, changes in contact transmission network etc may change the embedding parameters and hence our forecasting ability.",

To date, many researchers focused on infectious disease prediction have not appreciated that one must both identify an optimal window for forecasting and that this window is likely to change from outbreak-to-outbreak and from disease-to-disease. We believe that perhaps the key practical outcome from our investigation is to make people aware that the embedding dimension of the forecast is a key parameter for evaluating the quality of a disease forecast and that estimating it from historical data cannot guarantee that the same embedding dimension will generalize to future outbreaks.",

The same argument also supports our example of model shift due to vaccination. We agree with the reviewer that a complete characterization is interesting (and a few steps have been recently taken, for example in [9] ), but we consider it beyond the scope of this paper, where the focus is instead on the empirical limits to outbreak prediction. 9 .) The authors have to present better the SIR model and its parameters for the results to be reproducible. Also the algorithm of the network construction is missing.",

On the other hand, the main findings are already known in the community: the forecasting capability is limited by the time horizon, the predictability depends on the heterogeneity of the network (see e.g. Hafnagel et al., 2003, PNAS, 101, 15124-15129).",

It still seems like a very specific way of constructing temporal networks (it is clearly better than the first version).3) In several places, I feel that an explicit description of the method or the analytical form needs to be given, the description in plain english is useful but needs to be complemented with a formal description. Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): The revised paper is substantially improved. We thank the reviewer for their opinion and for the help in improving the manuscript.I do have a few technical questions/comments: 1) When computing PE, you have \u03c4 and d. A simple example should be worked out in the appendix. We added a figure to the supplement with the explicit calculation of the permutation entropy.2) Am still not completely convinced with the SIR dynamics using a temporal network. It still seems like a very specific way of constructing temporal networks (it is clearly better than the first version). We agree that we adopted a specific example; however, our intent was to show that it was possible to produce shifts in observed predictability even in simple synthetic examples, rather than provide an extensive description of all the factors that might affect the predictability. As we discuss in the paper, this remains an important area of future research.3) In several places, I feel that an explicit description of the method or the analytical form needs to be given, the description in plain english is useful but needs to be complemented with a formal description. We provide analytical descriptions of all terms throughout the manuscript. 4) Plots showing 1-H are way too busy making them hard to understand. Is there another way to depict this information. Maybe discretize it at some chosen time points in addition (along with uncertainty) would be perhaps easier?We have added a panel to figure 2 discretizing the permutation entropy after four months. 5) I like the weighted entropy measure and is clearly more appropriate. In our opinion, many researchers engaged in predicting outbreaks and public health officials studying outbreaks focus on the raw time series and, therefore, are interested in the non-weighted version of the permutation entropy. We believe it remains most appropriate to include both measures (as we have done in this version).Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): I am satisfied with the modified manuscript. We thank the reviewer for their opinion and for the help in improving the manuscript.Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):The authors have responded adequately to my remarks. Hence I recommend its acceptance. We thank the reviewer for their opinion and for the help in improving the manuscript.",
