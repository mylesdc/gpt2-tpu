Epitope mapping of PPV is important for developing new vaccines. In this study, we used spot synthesis analysis for epitope mapping of the capsid proteins of PPV (NADL-2 strain) and correlated the findings with predictive data from immunoinformatics. The virus was exposed to three conditions prior to inoculation in pigs: native (untreated), high hydrostatic pressure (350 MPa for 1 h) at room temperature and high hydrostatic pressure (350 MPa for 1 h) at \u2212 18\u00b0C, and was compared with a commercial vaccine produced using inactivated PPV. The screening of serum samples detected 44 positive spots corresponding to 20 antigenic sites. Each type of inoculated antigen elicited a distinct epitope set. In silico prediction located linear and discontinuous epitopes in B cells that coincided with several epitopes detected in spot synthesis of sera from pigs that received different preparations of inoculum. The conditions tested elicited antibodies against the VP1/VP2 antigen that differed in relation to the response time and the profile of structurally available regions that were recognized.",

One well-known approach in vaccine production is the use of inactivated viral preparations [9, 10] . In recent years, the use of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) has become an increasingly popular non-thermal method of inactivation [11] [12] [13] . This approach has been successfully used to inactivate several viruses and represents a promising alternative to vaccine development [14] . A major advantage of viral-inactivation by HHP is that key immunological sites are retained intact, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the inactivated virus in vaccine development. HHP also induces a potent and directed immune response without introducing new chemicals to the process. In this study, we used a combination of in silico and in vivo approaches to examine the immune responses to different HHP-PPV formulations that were then compared with a commercial vaccine produced using chemically-inactivated virus.",

The antigenicity of the protein was inferred with the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar scale, a semi-empirical method to predict antigenicity from the physicochemical properties of amino acids in protein sequences [26, 27] . The hydrophobic properties of the sequence were predicted with the Parker hydrophilicity scale [28] . The full length VP1 protein has not yet been crystallized. Therefore, to obtain a better understanding of the epitope mapping results we produced models for the first 174 amino acids encompassing both the PLA 2 domain and the nuclear localization signal, as well as the remaining residues, known to be buried in the PPV structure under physiological pH, but exposed in the early stages of productive infections. The phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), nuclear localization signal and connecting regions of the VP1 protein were modeled using the software I-TASSER (v. 5.1) [29] and the output evaluated in the webserver MolProbity [30] . All models were energy minimized in GROMACS and protonation states were adjusted to pH 5.0 (to mimic those for endosome fusion states and PLA 2 exposure). B cell epitope predictions were done using the crystal structure (PDB entry:1K3V) and the homology model generated for the VP1 complex with the softwares Bepro [31] , Disco-tope2 [32] and Epitopia [33] .",

Molecular dynamics simulations were done with the GROMACS software (v. 2016.3) [34] to evaluate putative structural changes caused by HHP (350 MPa) at 27\u00b0C and \u2212 18\u00b0C relative to the control conditions nder physiological conditions. Two systems were devised for the simulation run using a rombic dodecahedron as the simulation box limited at 10 A from the protein edges. The VP1-PPLA system was created with 138,811 atoms (11,221 atoms for the VP1-PPLA protein) and 75,857 atoms with 8447 atoms representing the VP2 solvated protein. The AMBER99SB force field was applied and the TIP3P explicit water model were selected for the nvt and npt equilibration protocols. The electrostatic interactions were calculated by using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method for the van der Waals interactions and the electrostatic interactions in the real space of the PME method. Energy minimization steps were conducted in vacuum using the steepest descent integrator until convergence followed by solvation and ion equilibration of the systems to prepare the systems for the NVT and NPT equilibration steps. To simulate the experimental conditions the equilibration systems were normalized to 300 K at atmospheric pressure followed by modifications in the NVT and NPT mdp options to mimic the desired HHP conditions of 350 MPa at 27\u00b0C and 350 MPa at \u2212 18\u00b0C. After the systems were equilibrated production runs for each condition were conducted for 20 ns and the outputs analyzed for structural parameters such as root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), radius of gyration, secondary structure fluctuations and also for the complete system, such as pressure, temperature and energy variations. Plots were generated with the Grace software package (http://plasma-gate.weizmann. ac.il/Grace/) and trajectory analyses were done using the VMD package as well as the built-in analysis packages present in GROMACS [35] .",

Precious insights can be harnessed from molecular dynamics simulations and the correlation with our experimental desing and results added value to the in vitro results. The method is powerful enough to evaluate structural perturbations in a given system under pressure and it has been extensively used before to dissect the effects of HHP in proteins. As expected from previous reports our results show small deviations in RMSD fluctuations with decreased positional movements as a function of the conditions applied to the system in silico. Molecular dynamics analysis of the problem investigated the behavior of the VP1-PPLA (Additional file 1: Figure S1 & Additional file 3: Figure S3 ) and VP2 (Additional file 2: Figure S2 & Additional file 4: Figure S4 ) under normal conditions and under the conditions of groups P and P-18. A 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation allowed comparison of the radius of gyration (Rg), an indicator of protein compactness, with the group N simulation and revealed an overall decrease of 0.42% in Rg for group P vs. group N (2.85 nm vs. 2.838 nm) and a 0.87% decrease for the P-18 simulation compared to group N (2.85 nm vs. 2.826 nm) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 & Additional file 2: Figure S2 ), suggesting that the simulation produced a more constrained protein. The total energy of the HHP simulation increased 0.83% against group N (\u2212 2.385 \u00d7 10 6 cal versus \u2212 2.405 \u00d7 10 6 cal) whereas that for group P-18 increased 9.85% (\u2212 2.385 \u00d7 10 6 cal versus \u2212 2.635 \u00d7 10 6 cal) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Conversely, a marked decrease in total volume was recorded during the group P and P-18 simulations compared with group N, which fluctuated around 1835 nm 3 vs. 1680 nm 3 (P) and 1655 nm 3 (P-18), suggesting that the simulation was successful in creating the desired pressure and temperature for the experiment (Additional file 1: Figure S1 & Additional file 2: Figure S2 ).",

A study in which Pepscan was used to synthesize 24 different peptides directed towards antigenic sites detected nine such sites and posited that those found in the N-terminal region were neutralizing epitopes [41] . Xie et al. [3] confirmed these findings by using a monoclonal antibody (C4) against VP1 of PPV to screen a 12-mer phage peptide library. These authors identified a mimotope corresponding to the N-terminal immuno-dominant region that protected mice against the virus. In the present study, we mapped 20 \"antigenic sites\" corresponding to 44 positive spots based on a combination of experimental conditions that consisted to vaccination/challenge settings.

Numerous studies since the 1980s have investigated the latter event following the demonstration that microinjections of antibodies can interfere with intracellular antigens [44] . The inhibition of antigen function by the binding of antibodies to their antigen within endosomes is dependent upon factors such as exposure, identity and, primarily, pH. Important advances have been made using genetic engineered antibodies to sustain binding at lower pH [45] . Identification of the IgGs that successfully bind to key viral proteins or functional domains (as in the present case) is of utmost importance in tackling infections early on. The results described here indicate that the native conformation of the virus elicited an immune response against the PLA 2 target, but only in later stages of antibody production, whereas pressure and the combination of low temperature and pressure evoked an exuberant response that was significant at all sampling intervals in the P-18 experiment.",

Initially, group N showed a strong antibody response for spots B25 (aa 197-212) and C1 (aa 201-216) at sampling times D28 and D58. These spots correspond to the N-terminal region of VP2, information that is also present in the crystal structure of VP2. Epitopes located in the VP2 capsid protein of PPV are important for generating neutralizing antibodies against this virus, with a high potential to activate B cells. These studies indicate that the N-terminal of VP2 is a strong candidate for B cell epitopes and should be included in vaccines [46, 47] . Antibodies that bound to a region composed of amino acids 497-516 were seen soon after the second inoculation and the titers (inferred from the intensity of the phosphatase reactions) were maintained throughout the experiment. The immunodominant regions in VP2 belong to the loops and other regions in the N-and C-terminals [41, 46, 47] .

HHP elicited responses like those of the vaccine in the VP1 N-terminal region, as well as for the VP2 variable regions mentioned before on the fourth inoculation, prior to the challenge with PPV. In our study, amino acid residues (45, 217-219 and 556) corresponding to the mapped epitopes included some of the sites reported by Streck et al [51] The substitution of amino acid residues at sites located mainly on the surface of PPV is important not only for understanding the evolutionary mechanism of adaptive response to the host, but also for identifying possible strategies to produce more effective vaccines against PPV.",

Although HHP did not directly affect the tertiary structure of the proteins, the exposure of different parts of the proteins, including hydrophobic regions, in response to these conditions could explain the appearance of new epitopes [52] . A direct comparison of the secondary structures of the VP2 crystal structure obtained after a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the experimental conditions also showed small alterations to the original configuration (SF 2ary), mostly from switches between flexible regions (the most frequent interconversions found were from coil to bend, turn to3-helix and alpha-helix to turn to 3-helix). Conversely, HPP and low temperature HPP produced more stable secondary structures compared to the simulation with no pressure or temperature constraints. HHP and low temperature HHP simulations displayed small fluctuations during the production run and only the N-terminal region of the VP2 1K3V structure showed changes in configuration (amino acids . Compared with the molecular dynamics of native VP2, the HHP simulation tended to produce fixed turns where interconversion between bends and turns were recorded (amino acids [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] whereas low temperature HHP fixed this region in a 3-helix configuration. The region from amino acids 75-85 fluctuated among alpha-helix/turn/3-helix configurations in the native simulation but the region was then fixed as an alpha-helical structure in the HHP run and varied between turns and bends in the low temperature HHP run. The interactions mounted by the protein-solvent system at HHP are more favorable and due to small deformations in the internal bonds the protein-protein interaction energies are also increased (total energy graphs). The H-bond network is also favored by HHP, as previously reported for SOD, lysozyme and BPTI, the results for the capsid proteins H-bond network were increased during the simulation and were significant when compared against the N state. More studies are necessary to evaluate if possible correlations can be produced from MD simulations and putative immunological responses. An important limitation of our study is the simulation of single proteins in water, it is of particular interest full-atom simulations of complete viral capsids in water subjected to HHP and cold denaturation processes to expand in this field as computational power becomes available.",

These findings suggest that the effect of pressure on kinetics arises from a larger positive activation volume for folding than for unfolding; this in turn leads to a significant slowing down of the folding rate with increasing pressure. For viral capsids under HHP, D' Andrea et al [53] noted that the treatment enhanced the viricidal effect on hepatitis A virus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that the efficacy of treatment depends on capsid conformation. These authors suggested a correlation between mature and immature capsids, with the accessibility of the immunodominant site near the five-fold axis possibly explaining the susceptibility of the virus to inactivation by HPP [53] .",

Indeed, pressure can result in virus inactivation while preserving immunogenic properties [11, 12, 14, 21] . The forces governing viral assembly and disassembly rely on both the microenvironment and the protein-protein interaction network produced by their genetic codes [54] . The contributions from studies on the dynamics of capsid autoassembly in vitro and in silico have provided interesting insights into the behavior of such ensembles. As illustrated by Silva et al. [14] and tested in silico in a number of conditions [55] [56] [57] , the use of HHP methods alters the distribution of forces in the viral capsid to promote an energy compliant structure; this treatment results in a tangible output as epitopes revealed by this method are of great interest for both diagnostics and basic research.",

Recent work by Letko et al. [58] addressed fundamental questions on the subject by conducting serial passages of the virus while selecting for a new receptor adaptation expressed on the target cell; this approach allowed the identification of key structural aspects in the viral code that permitted receptor adaptation to a new receptor. In silico simulation methods provide good models for processes on this scale and allow important comparisons with experimental approaches, with all-atom simulations of full virus capsids becoming computationally feasible for most laboratories [59] . The latter authors also suggested that a dynamic h-bond network could potentially have a role in ion selectivity within the capsid. The effect of HHP on protein structure has been increasingly studied in silico as computational power and resources become increasingly available; such analyses have substantially advanced our understanding of the influence of each experimental condition on its target. Protein compressibility has been tested in silico in several configurations. Voichita [60] reported the effect of pressure on globular proteins by measuring the variations in protein total volume and the volume variation per residue after picosecond exposures. The findings suggested that protein volume was significantly compressed during HHP experiments in silico and that this effect was mostly due to the difference between SASA and the VdW radii. Secondary structures also contributed to the results obtained, with the compressibility of \u03b1-helices being inferior to that of \u03b2-sheets. In contrast, Vahidi et al. [61] found that in silico HHP failed to modify secondary structures such as \u03b2-barrels, thus agreeing with previous findings for loops and helical structures.",

In the present case, the combination of HHP and epitope mapping provided a broader, more refined perspective of the epitope landscape stimulated by each preparation. This information could potentially be used to track HHP-vaccinated pig herds as a first scenario, or, conversely, be used as a combined alternative to cover the immune response against the virus. Taken together, our findings provide detailed insight into the immune system of pigs when the animals are stimulated with the same molecular configuration of an antigen, the structure of which can be altered by pressure and temperature.
