While there was no increase in the rates of ILI being reported in obese patients, 1 early reports during the pandemic noted an association between severity of illness and obesity. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Several studies in adults found an association between obesity and death due to pandemic influenza. [11] [12] [13] [14] Another study, however, found no association between obesity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) participants. 15 Far fewer studies examined syndromic influenza-like illness (rather than restricted to influenza). Two studies found a link between obesity and hospitalization from influenza-like illness, 16, 17 and another showed higher rates of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness in obese patients. 18 One additional study evaluated rates of obesity in the community and demonstrated that communities with a greater prevalence of obesity were more likely to have high influenza-related hospitalization rates. 19 None of these studies, however, determined the etiology of the participants illness, and none examined low body mass index as a risk factor.",

Being underweight seems to be a consistent risk factor in all adult participants with ILI.Our analysis did not demonstrate a clear association between body mass and the risk of severe ILI in children. A few prior studies found obesity to be a risk factor.31,32 Recent studies suggest BMI z-Age, gender, and presence of chronic conditions were also taken into account when running the multiple logistic regression model. Statistically significant ORs and their corresponding P-values are bolded. not reflect the appropriate categories relevant to categorizing immune dysfunction from obesity.One significant limitation to our study is that it enrolled participants that sought medical care for an influenza-like illness. It is not a population-based study that can accurately assess the risk that body mass confers for infection. Additionally, the study cannot differentiate within the NIRV group between those with true infections (but not detected on the multiplex platform), or those with non-infectious etiologies of the respiratory symptoms.In conclusion, our findings suggest that adults, who are under-weight or morbidly obese, even if they do not have chronic conditions that increase the risk of influenza-related complications, may be at increased risk of developing severe disease due to seasonal influenza infection as well as other respiratory viral infections. Clinicians should keep a patient's body mass index in mind when evaluating risk and deciding on a course of treatment.
