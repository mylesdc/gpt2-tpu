In the United States, inactivated and subunit PEDV vaccines for pregnant sows are available, but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from PEDV na\u00efve sows. A safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC22A at the 100th cell culture passage level -Clone no. 4 (P100C4) and at the 120th passage level (P120), in weaned pigs. Results: Four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with PEDV PC22A-P3 (virulent), -P100C4, -P120, and mock, respectively, and challenged with the P3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). After inoculation, P3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral RNA shedding. P100C4 and P120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs, although viral RNA was detected in feces of all pigs, except for one P100C4-inoculated pig. Compared with the P120 group, P3-and P100C4-inoculated pigs had higher serum PEDV-specific IgG and viral neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers at 14 dpi. After the challenge, no pigs in the P3 group but all pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups had diarrhea. Compared with the P120 group, pigs in the P100C4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers, higher titers of serum PEDV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs, and higher numbers of intestinal IgA Ab-secreting cells.",

P100C4 induced higher PEDV-specific antibody responses than P120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge. Therefore, P100C4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics. It also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a PEDV vaccination regimen, whose efficacy can be tested in the future.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, is highly contagious and causes enteric disease in pigs of all ages [1] . North America was free from PEDV until April 2013 when highly virulent PEDV strains, classified as non-S INDEL PEDV strains, suddenly emerged and spread quickly throughout the United States (US) [2, 3] . The major clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are diarrhea and vomiting. The mortality rates were high (50-100%) in neonatal piglets born into PEDV na\u00efve sows [4] . Although milder clinical signs were seen in older pigs, such as weaned pigs and sows, their growth and reproductive performance were adversely impacted [5, 6] . In the US, the economic impact was the highest during 2013-2014, including the deaths of 10% of the total piglet population and $0.9-1.8 billion in losses [7] . Subsequently, the incidence of new PEDV cases showed a seasonal pattern, peaking during winter [8] . This suggests that epidemic PEDV outbreaks have decreased and PEDV infections may be mostly endemic in the US. Currently, PEDV infection occurs in at least 39 US states and some US sow herds suffer from chronic losses (https://www.aasv.org/Resources/PEDv/PED-vWhatsNew.php). Effective vaccine programs are required, but still under development [9] .",

            "text": "It is well documented that natural infections and/or live attenuated vaccines elicit local mucosal immunity against enteric virus replication in the intestinal mucosa. In enteric virus-infected and recovered pregnant sows, gut-derived IgA immunocytes (B memory cells) migrate to the mammary glands and produce high titers of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies (Ab) in colostrum and milk (via the gut-mammary-sIgA axis), contributing to passive lactogenic immunity that protects neonatal suckling piglets from the disease [10, 11] . Several live attenuated PEDV vaccines, based on classical PEDV strains, such as CV777 [12] , DR13 [13] and 83P-5 [14] , have been used in Asia for decades. However, their protection against the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains was questionable [15, 16] because severe PED outbreaks occurred in regularly vaccinated farms. In the US, there are two conditionally licensed PEDV vaccines based on the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains, an inactivated vaccine (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) and an alphavirus-based PEDV subunit vaccine (Merck, Ames, IA). However, after vaccination of PEDV na\u00efve gilts/sows, neither vaccine induced high protection rates against PED in neonatal pigs [9] . One possible reason is that intramuscular injection of inactivated or subunit PEDV vaccine mainly stimulates systemic, but not mucosal immunity [11, 17] . PEDV-specific immunity in sows recovered from previous PEDV infection can be boosted by vaccination with the inactivated vaccine to induce sufficient levels of lactogenic immunity to protect their piglets [18] . In the field, intentional infection of sows with autogenous PEDV during gestation (feedback exposure) was used to induce lactogenic immunity in sows to protect piglets [9, 19] . However, this feedback exposure has a risk of spreading other infectious agents to the entire herd and PEDV infection may become persistent on farms. Therefore, a live attenuated vaccine based on the emerging highly virulent PEDV strains that can prime mucosal immunity is urgently needed but has not been developed in the US.",

PC22A P100 and the above passages showed various degrees of cell culture adaptation in vitro and virulence attenuation in vivo. Compared with the highly attenuated P160, the less attenuated P120 replicated more efficiently in neonatal piglets and induced a higher protection rate against challenge with the highly virulent homologous virus. It is well documented that weaned pigs and sows are less susceptible to PEDV infection than neonatal piglets [6, 21, 22] . Many highly attenuated PEDV/ porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains replicated poorly and induced marginal immunity in weaned pigs and sows [23] [24] [25] . Because the evaluation of vaccine candidates in sows is very expensive and labor-intensive, young pigs, such as weaned pigs, can be used as a surrogate model to initially evaluate the safety, immune responses and protection efficacy of PEDV vaccine candidates [9] . Therefore, the aims of this study were to characterize the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of two PEDV vaccine candidates, P100C4 and P120 of the PEDV PC22A strain, in weaned pigs.",

However, these requirements were usually mutually exclusive when attenuated vaccines were developed by using traditional cell culture methods alone. Previous studies reported that pigs orally or oronasally inoculated with attenuated PEDV [26] , TEGV [27, 28] or rotavirus [29] strains developed lower protective immunity than pigs infected with the corresponding virulent virus. In TGEV naive sows, only oral inoculation with virulent TGEV or with multi doses of attenuated TGEV vaccines induced passive protection in the nursing pigs [10, 11] . In this study, pigs inoculated with virulent PEDV PC22A P3 developed complete protective immunity against subsequent challenge with a high dose of the homologous virus. Although one pig in the P120 group had diarrhea (FC = 2) at 1-2 dpi when its fecal PEDV RNA shedding was extremely low (4.9 log 10 copies/mL at 1 dpi) or undetectable (at 2 dpi), diarrhea probably cannot be attributable to P120 infection. So, neither the attenuated Different letters in each column denote differences among groups (P < 0.05) dpi: days post-inoculation, dpc: days post-challenge, FC: fecal consistency (0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semi-liquid; 3, liquid), N: nucleocapsid, NA: not available PC22A-P100C4 nor the P120 caused disease in 40-day-old weaned pigs, fulfilling the safety requirement for a vaccine. On the other hand, one dose of P100C4 or P120 did not induce sufficient immunity to protect the pigs from diarrhea post challenge. The optimal stimulation of mucosal immune responses requires local virus replication and adequate amounts of viral antigens present for a sufficient period of time.

Forty-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated with mock, P100C4, P120 or P3. Subsequently, all pigs were challenged with P3 at 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). Data are displayed as mean with standard deviation in each group. The numbers of animals in each treatment group were six at inoculation and four at the challenge. Different letters mean significant different levels among groups (P < 0.05) intestinal epithelial cells and the dose of virus inoculum are two critical factors [17, 23] . The short duration of fecal PEDV RNA shedding indicates that P100C4 and P120 replicated to a more limited extent in weaned pigs than P3. The inoculum dose [6 log 10 plaque formation unit (PFU) per pig] used for P100C4 and P120 viruses was similar to that (12 log 10 copies/mL, corresponding to 6 log 10 PFU) for the virulent PEDV PC21A strain, which was isolated from the same PEDV outbreak as the PC22A strain [30] . Whether a higher dose than the current 6 log 10 PFU per pig and/or multiple doses of P100C4 and P120 would enhance the protection efficiency should be examined in the future.",

Furthermore, P120 was more attenuated than P100C4 based on longer incubation time, lower fecal virus shedding titers and more limited viral antigen distribution in the intestines. In this study, P3 was still virulent, and P100C4 and P120 were completely attenuated in weaned pigs, probably due to all age-dependent resistance to disease in weaned versus neonatal piglets [21, 22] . P100C4 and P120 did not show substantial differences in pathogenicity as neither P100C4 nor P120 caused clinical signs in weaned pigs. Besides, in one of the six pigs in P100C4 group productive infection was not established, suggesting that host-related variability in susceptibility to PEDV probably contributed to this result. However, these three viruses differ significantly in immunogenicity. In the P100C4 group, but not the P120 group, titers of serum PEDV IgA, IgG and VN Ab and the numbers of PEDV IgA ASCs were boosted significantly after the P3 challenge. In addition, fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers in the P100C4 group decreased earlier than those in the mock and P120 groups post challenge. These results suggest that P100C4 infection induced stronger primary and anamnestic immune responses. However, the P120-inoculated pigs had lower serum PEDV Ab titers than those inoculated with P3 or PC100C4 post inoculation. After the challenge with P3, anamnestic immune responses in the P120 group were marginal. Interestingly, serum secondary Ab responses in the P3 group were lower than those in the P100C4 group, although the number of ileum IgA ASCs was significantly higher in the P3 group than the P100C4 group. Because intestinal IgA Ab is generally considered as the most relevant to protection against PEDV infection [11, 17] . It is likely that pigs inoculated with virulent P3 developed sufficient intestinal mucosal immune responses to efficiently neutralize the challenge virus and prevent virus replication, corresponding with low fecal PEDV RNA shedding and no disease. On the other hand, even attenuated P100C4 elicited some IgA and IgG Ab response at 14 and 21 dpi, it did not provide weaned pigs with sufficient mucosal protection against virulent P3 challenge. So the replication of the challenge virus in pigs of the P100C4 group induced higher serum secondary immune responses than in the P3 group.",

In general, the virulent PEDV provided higher levels of protective immunity than the attenuated strains. None of the virulent PEDV-inoculated pigs developed clinical signs after challenge with the homologous virus. However, different attenuated viruses induced various protection rates. In the study of attenuated PEDV CV777 strain [23] , 0, 12.5 and 46% of pigs in high dose group [5.4 \u00d7 10 6 fluorescent focus formation unit (FFU)/pig], low dose group (2.55 \u00d7 10 5 FFU/ pig), and mock group, respectively, developed diarrhea after virulent CV777 challenge (unknown dose) at 21 dpi. In the study of attenuated PEDV PT strain [24] , 100% (3/3) of mock-inoculated pigs developed watery diarrhea after challenge with 5.0 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /pig of virulent PEDV PT-P5 at 4 wks post inoculation, while none (0/6) of attenuated PEDV PT-P96-inoculated pigs developed diarrhea after challenge. In this study, all the pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups showed diarrhea after challenge with the P3 virus (5.6 log 10 PFU/pig) at 24 dpi. Overall, different virus strains and pig conditions (ages, sources of pigs, breed etc.) used by different laboratories may contribute to the variable protection rates. In addition, we did not investigate PEDV-specific cellular immune responses that may play an important role in protection against PEDV challenge. More studies on T cell immune responses to PEDV infection in the future will provide a more complete picture of protective immunity and better guidance for PEDV vaccine development.",

            "text": "The long-term goal of our study is to develop safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines targeting sows to generate lactogenic immunity to protect neonatal piglets from PED. In this study, conventional weaned pigs were used to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidates because of three reasons: 1) previous studies suggest that young pigs can be used as a surrogate model to evaluate potential sow vaccines, 2) it is more economical compared with using sows to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate, and 3) weaned pigs are potential targets for vaccination for active immunity agaist PED [9] . Two partially attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, PC22A-P100C4 and -P120, replicated to a lower extent than the P3 virus and caused no disease in weaned pigs. However, concerns remain because the attenuated PEDV strains may revert to virulence via mutation in the natural hosts or generate new virulent strains by exchanging their genes with field strains via recombination. With the development of reverse genetics technology [31, 32] , virus with limited replication competency and defective in recombination can be engineered to alleviate this concern in the future. On the other hand, both PC22A-P100C4 and -P120 induced insufficient immune responses to protect pigs from the challenge with a high dose of virulent virus. After the challenge, only P100C4-, but not P120-, inoculated pigs developed strong anamnestic Ab responses. Considering the fact that feedback method using highly virulent PEDV viruses may facilitate the spread of other infectious agents in the herds and PEDV persistence on farms, and inactivated/subunit PEDV vaccine is mainly effective in previously PEDV-exposed but not PEDV-naive sows, a safe and efficacious live attenuated PEDV vaccine is still urgently needed. However, our results demonstrate the difficulties and challenges in the development of live attenuated vaccines using cell culture adaptation method alone. With the availability of an infectious clone system for PEDV [31] , the P100C4 can be further modified to enhance its immunogenicity and maintain its attenuation. The combination of attenuated (such as P100C4) and inactivated vaccines, and/or the inclusion of mucosal adjuvants may be a safe and effective PEDV vaccination regimen as confirmed for TGEV sow vaccines [28] . All of these hypotheses can be investigated in the future.",

The cell culture immunofluorescence assay (CCIF) procedure was then conducted using PEDV N monoclonal Ab (SD6-29) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Serotec) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The numbers of FFUs in the wells were counted and the VN Ab titer of each serum sample was expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution giving an 80% reduction in the number of FFU. All sera were tested in triplicate, and the final Ab titer was expressed as the mean of repeats.",

Fragments of ileum were washed twice, first with washing solution (RPMI 1640 with 10 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid], 200 mg of gentamicin per mL, and 20 mg of ampicillin per mL) followed by Hanks' balanced salt solution. The tissues were cut into small pieces, placed in HBSS containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EDTA, and vigorously shaken for 30 min to dislodge the epithelial cells. Subsequently, the segments were minced, suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 U of type II collagenase (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) per mL for digestion at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with gentle shaking. Afterward, the supernatants were collected, and the remaining tissues were pressed through stainless steel Collectors fitted with an 80 \u03bcm mesh screen (Collector, FL, USA). Similarly, spleen and MLN were also minced and pressed through stainless steel 80-mesh screens. Single cellular suspensions were then collected and subjected to gradient centrifugation in Percoll (Sigma). Blood was collected aseptically in 25% (v/v) acid citrate glucose. The peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Ficoll-Paque Research Grade, Pharmacia Biotech., Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. Collected MNCs were subjected for frozen in liquid nitrogen as described [38] .",
