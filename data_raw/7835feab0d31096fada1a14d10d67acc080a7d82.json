            "text": "Routine screening of lung transplant recipients and hospital patients for respiratory virus infections allowed to identify human rhinovirus (HRV) in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, including immunocompromised hosts chronically infected with the same strain over weeks or months. Phylogenetic analysis of 144 HRV-positive samples showed no apparent correlation between a given viral genotype or species and their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract or lead to protracted infection. By contrast, protracted infections were found almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, thus suggesting that host factors rather than the virus genotype modulate disease outcome, in particular the immune response. Complete genome sequencing of five chronic cases to study rhinovirus genome adaptation showed that the calculated mutation frequency was in the range observed during acute human infections. Analysis of mutation hot spot regions between specimens collected at different times or in different body sites revealed that non-synonymous changes were mostly concentrated in the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2 and VP3, independent of the HRV type. In an immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient infected with the same HRV strain for more than two years, both classical and ultra-deep sequencing of samples collected at different time points in the upper and lower respiratory tracts showed that these virus populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable over the course of infection, except for the last month. Specific signatures were found in the last two lower respiratory tract populations, including changes in the 59UTR polypyrimidine tract and the VP2 immunogenic site 2. These results highlight for the first time the ability of a given rhinovirus to evolve in the course of a natural infection in immunocompromised patients and complement data obtained from previous experimental inoculation studies in immunocompetent volunteers.",

However, they are increasingly reported to be associated with complications, such as asthma [1, 2, 3] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [4] , pneumonia, and bronchiolitis in young children [5] . HRVs have the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract (LRT) [6, 7] and can cause chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts [8, 9] . Unlike enteroviruses, most rhinoviruses replicate optimally at lower airway temperatures, which is thought to explain their URT tropism [10] . Rhinovirus strains infecting the LRT may require specific adaptative genomic changes that have not yet been identified.",

The host immune status is known to play a critical role for viral clearance and resolution of infection. Abnormal innate immune responses to HRV have been observed in individuals presenting HRV-induced COPD or asthma exacerbation [11, 12] . By contrast, reports are rare on the implication of viral determinants in HRV disease severity. Palmemberg et al proposed that the rhinovirus 59UTR polypyrimidine tract may affect virulence [13] . At the serotype or species level, a clear association between the genotype and induced pathology remains to be demonstrated. HRVs were previously classified into two species, HRV-A and HRV-B. In 2006, a third species, HRV-C, was identified [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and appears to be highly prevalent and circulating worldwide [20, 21, 22] . Several studies have suggested that HRV-C types are prone to induce more severe illness in children [17, 21, 23, 24, 25] .",

However, superimposition of all changes along a reference genome (HRV-A2) (Figure 2A ) revealed that whereas synonymous changes were distributed along the genome without any apparent specific pattern, non-synonymous mutations were clustering mostly in the capsid genes VP2, VP3 and VP1, the first half of 2A genes, and in 3A genes. Cold spot regions were located in the viral capsid gene VP4, as well as in 2B, 2C, 3B, 3C, and most of 3D. Only three changes were found in the 59UTR and one in the 39UTR. The variation hot spots observed in the capsid genes were similar to the amino acid variability observed among HRV reference types ( Figure 2B ).",

The mutation rate then slowed down shortly before the patient's death (4.3610 7 and 1.3610 8 viral copy/ml for the last URT and LRT, respectively), despite a high viral load at the end of our follow-up period. This may account for the overall slower mutation rate calculated for this patient when compared with those infected for a shorter period ( Table 1 ). The last three samples collected simultaneously in both the URT and LRT were further analyzed by high throughput sequencing to compare variation at the minority population level ($5% of the total population). Most minority variants present in the LRT after 26.6 months persisted in this site, but were absent in the corresponding URT viral populations ( Figure 3B) . A similar observation was made with the majority variants and demonstrates that the genomes of the URT and Figure 3C ). Specific synonymous changes were found in both the URT and LRT sequences. However, non-synonymous changes were observed only in the LRT where we identified one change in the 59UTR polypyrimidine tract [44] , one non-synonymous change in the VP2 immunogenic site 2, and one non-synonymous change in protein 2A [32, 45] .",

In both lung transplant recipients and hospital patients, HRV-A and -C strains presented a similar propensity to infect the LRT. No HRV-B strains were found to be associated with LRT, but the relatively small number of infected samples precludes us from drawing firm conclusions. In this respect, we have previously described chronic LRT HRV-B infections [8] . In our study, protracted infections were all found in hosts with a very low level of immunity (mostly lung transplant recipients and a 3-month-old infant). These results suggest that host factors are determinants of disease outcome, rather than virus type.",

Complete Sanger-based and ultra-deep genome sequencing were performed at different time points and sites during infection. Mutation mapping along the HRV genome pointed out that synonymous changes were roughly spread along the entire ORF, whereas non-synonymous changes clustered mostly in the capsid VP2, VP3, and VP1 genes. These capsid genes are also the most variable during acute infections in immunocompetent hosts [37] , as well as the most diverse among the 99 HRV reference types [13] . The VP2, VP3 and VP1 proteins form the outer shell of the virion and are under immune pressure, which explains their fast evolution. The localization of mutation hot spots in these genes in immunocompromised hosts may appear unexpected. However, although these patients are highly immunosuppressed at the time of transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy is then adapted to prevent graft rejection and to preserve a residual cellular and humoral immunity that may account for this observation. This residual immunity is also necessary for the control and recovery of viral and bacterial infections observed in these patients.",

Phylogenetic analysis of 11 complete genome sequences (including ultra-deep sequences performed at three different time points) revealed that the URT and LRT populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable for a prolonged period of time, either because of co-variation or, more likely, constant viral population mixing. Once potentially adapted to the host through the accumulation of non-synonymous changes mainly in the capsid gene VP1, the viral populations appeared to evolve more slowly. Finally, we observed signatures of putative adaptation to lower airway conditions after several months of infection. Indeed, the last two LRT populations studied presented specific changes in the 59UTR polypyrimidine tract and two non-synonymous changes, one in the VP2 immunogenic site 2 and the second in protein 2A. These changes were absent in the URT population and, upon their appearance, the two populations remained separated as confirmed by ultra-deep sequencing analysis. Although the direct impact of these changes on virus growth ability at lower airway conditions remains to be demonstrated experimentally, the very high viral load observed at this stage suggests that both populations were adapted to their sites.",

With the emergence of new therapies and progress in transplantation, the population of immunocompromised patients is constantly increasing.
