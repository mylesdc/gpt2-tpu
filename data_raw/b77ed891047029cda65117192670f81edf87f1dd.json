            "text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is comprised of two subunits (S1 and S2), has a role in virulence in vivo, and is responsible for cellular tropism in vitro. We have previously demonstrated that replacement of the S glycoprotein ectodomain from the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV with the corresponding region from the virulent M41-CK strain resulted in a recombinant virus, BeauR-M41(S), with the in vitro cell tropism of M41-CK. The IBV Beaudette strain is able to replicate in both primary chick kidney cells and Vero cells, whereas the IBV M41-CK strain replicates in primary cells only. In order to investigate the region of the IBV S responsible for growth in Vero cells, we generated a series of recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S glycoproteins, consisting of regions from the Beaudette and M41-CK S gene sequences, within the genomic background of Beaudette. The S2, but not the S1, subunit of the Beaudette S was found to confer the ability to grow in Vero cells. Various combinations of Beaudette-specific amino acids were introduced into the S2 subunit of M41 to determine the minimum requirement to confer tropism for growth in Vero cells. The ability of IBV to grow and produce infectious progeny virus in Vero cells was subsequently narrowed down to just 3 amino acids surrounding the S2= cleavage site. Conversely, swapping of the 3 Beaudette-associated amino acids with the corresponding ones from M41 was sufficient to abolish Beaudette growth in Vero cells.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines, both live attenuated and inactivated, are currently grown on embryonated hen's eggs, a cumbersome and expensive process due to the fact that most IBV strains do not grow in cultured cells. The reverse genetics system for IBV creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. The observation that IBV Beaudette has the additional tropism for growth on Vero cells also invokes the possibility of generating IBV vaccines produced from cultured cells rather than by the use of embryonated eggs. The regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism were identified in this study. This information will enable the rational design of a future generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.

The genomic RNA associates with the nucleoprotein (N), forming helical nucleocapsids that are enclosed within lipid envelopes containing the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, and small envelope (E) protein. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is a highly glycosylated type I membrane glycoprotein that is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of about 180 kDa that oligomerizes into homotrimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and that is processed in the Golgi apparatus of the host cell (16-18) and is observable as 20-nm structures projecting from the virion surface by electron microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the S protein forms a clove-shaped trimer of S1 subunits linked to a stalk of trimeric S2 subunits (19-21). The S protein is responsible for binding to the target cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, fulfilling a major role in the infection of susceptible cells (22).",

            "text": "Coronavirus S glycoproteins consist of four domains: an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved during synthesis; the ectodomain, which is present on the outside of the virus particle; the transmembrane region, which is responsible for anchoring the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virus particle; and the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus. The S glycoproteins of some coronaviruses, including IBV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), are cleaved during biosynthesis into two subunits, S1 and S2, by a furin-like protease in the Golgi apparatus, which remain noncovalently linked (23). The IBV S glycoprotein (1,162 amino acids) is composed of two subunits, S1 (535 amino acids, 90 kDa), comprising the N-terminal half of the S protein, and S2 (627 amino acids, 84 kDa), comprising the C-terminal half of the S protein. As with other coronaviruses, the S2 subunit contains the transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domains and the S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (24-27). Proteolytic activation and binding of the S1 subunit to the host cell receptor induce conformational changes in the spike (28, 29) (30), leading to virus-cell fusion and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (31). The ectodomain region of the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide (32-39) and two heptad repeat regions involved in oligomerization of the S protein (40) and is required for entry into susceptible cells (41-43). The spike interacts with the M protein on pre-Golgi membranes, forming multimeric complexes (44), and is incorporated into forming virions (45).",

Although all coronavirus RBDs are found within the S1 subunit, they are virus specific and vary in position throughout the S1 domain (46-48). The location of the RBD of IBV has been mapped to be within the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the S1 subunit (49). The host cell receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified; several of the Alphacoronaviruses, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), type II feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), use aminopeptidase N as the host cell receptor (50-52). In contrast, Betacoronaviruses have been found to utilize a variety of different receptors. The principal receptor for MHV is murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) (53); the virus also attaches to O-acetylated sialic acid, which is mediated by an extra structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein found in the virus membrane of some coronaviruses in this genus, rather than the S glycoprotein (54). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor (55) along with CD209L (56) and is also thought to use the C-type lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and L-SIGN as alternative receptors independently of ACE2 (57). The receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified to be dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also known as CD26 (58). The protein receptor for IBV has not yet been elucidated, although two strains of IBV, M41 and Beaudette, have been shown to use \u24232,3-linked sialic acid as an attachment factor (59, Bickerton et al.",

The interaction between IBV and sialic acid has been confirmed by Madu et al. (63) , who also identified a heparan sulfate (HS) binding site between amino acid residues 686 and 691 of the S2 subunit of the Beaudette S glycoprotein and showed that HS may be involved as a cofactor in Beaudette virus entry into host cells. Yamada and Liu (64) identified an additional furin cleavage motif within the putative HS binding site identified by Madu et al. (63) with a role in viral entry and syncytium formation in vitro. Cleavage was mapped to arginine residue 690. The susceptibility of cultured cells to infection with Beaudette was subsequently found to correlate with cellular furin expression levels (65) . This additional proteolytic cleavage site within the S2 subunit, named S2=, has since been identified in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-229E and found to mediate membrane fusion and viral infectivity (66) (67) (68) (69) .",

However, some strains of IBV, following adaptation, are able to replicate in primary chicken cells, such as chick kidney (CK) cells. Interestingly, the Beaudette strain, after several hundred passages in embryonated eggs, was also discovered to have an extended host range with the ability to replicate in a mammalian cell line, Vero cells (72) , and to a limited extent in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell lines (73) . We have previously demonstrated that the cellular tropism of IBV is determined by the S glycoprotein; replacement of the ectodomain of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein with the corresponding region from the pathogenic IBV M41-CK resulted in a recombinant IBV (rIBV), BeauR-M41(S), which had the tissue tropism associated with M41-CK (74) . The present study aims to elucidate the specific regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism, thus enabling the rational design and generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.",

Conversely, rIBV BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK, in which only the BSM in the Beaudette S2 subunit was replaced with the corresponding MM sequence from M41, lost its ability to grow in Vero cells (Fig. 4C) , with a growth phenotype being observed for M41 and BeauR-M41(S). This observation was confirmed by analysis of the growth kinetics of the rIBVs in Vero cells (Fig. 4D) . Production of progeny BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK virus from Vero cells was undetectable. Although BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK produced progeny virus in Vero cells, the growth was considerably lower than that observed for Beau-R. Progeny BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK virus was observed only from 24 h postinfection and reached a peak titer at 72 h postinfection that was about 6 log 10 lower than that of Beau-R. These results show that the loss of the BSM abolished the ability of Beau-R to grow on Vero cells and that the accruement of the BSM resulted in the ability of an rIBV expressing the M41 S to have a tropism for growth on Vero cells, albeit to a lesser extent than replacement with the entire Beaudette S2. Overall, it appeared that either a complete Beaudette S2 subunit or other additional Beaudette S2-specific amino acids may be required for the growth characteristics observed with the complete Beaudette S2.",

BeauR-S-MM isolates were unable to maintain replication on Vero cells for three passages, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The isolates caused no CPE, and no infected cells were observed on either CK or Vero cells (data not shown). The rIBV BeauR-M41-S-BSM isolates were successfully passaged on Vero cells, and the growth kinetics of one of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 7 -Vero passaged isolates were analyzed. The virus had a growth pattern very similar, within 1 log 10 , to the growth pattern of Beau-R on Vero cells (Fig.  5) . No additional mutations were identified in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 7 -Vero S gene, other than the nucleotide substitution identified at P 3 -CK, A 22226 C, resulting in the amino acid substitution D 620 A in the S2 subunit. The genetic stability of BeauR-M41-S-BSM observed over seven passages on Vero cells indicates that the spike glycoprotein is not under pressure to mutate under these conditions. Generation of rIBVs with additional Beaudette-specific amino acid modifications within the M41-CK S2 subunit. Once it was established that the BSM within the S2 subunit is able to confer the extended tropism of IBV in cell culture, other Beaudettespecific amino acids, identified in the Beaudette S2 subunit in comparison to other IBV S2 sequences (Fig. 1B) , were introduced into the M41-CK S2 subunit, in addition to the BSM. In order to determine the specific amino acids and minimum number of amino acid changes required to fully confer tropism, full-length IBV cDNAs with various combinations of the Beaudette-specific amino acids in the S2 subunit of M41 based on the BeauR-M41-S-BSM genomic background were generated; L 578 F and N 617 S were introduced by pGPT-M41-S2-L 578 F-N 617 S, and N 826 S, L 857 F, and I 1000 V were introduced by pGPT-M41-S2-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V.

At 24 h postinfection, only small foci of infected Vero cells were generated by some of these rIBVs during the initial passage on Vero cells (Fig. 6E and G) . This is reflected in the delayed growth during the first 24 h postinfection, as shown in Fig. 6B . As shown above, passage of BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK on Vero cells improved the growth of this virus in Vero cells; therefore, the rIBVs with the additional Beaudettederived amino acids in the M41 S2 subunit were passaged on Vero cells, and the P 7 -Vero isolates were reexamined for growth on Vero cells. Analysis of the growth kinetics of the P 7 -Vero isolates on Vero cells clearly demonstrated that all the rIBVs now replicated with patterns similar to and peak titers equivalent to those observed for Beau-R (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, three of the P 7 -Vero rIBVs, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 617 S, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S, and BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V, had higher titers of progeny virus, almost 2 log 10 higher to 24 h postinfection, than Beau-R; at 72 h postinfection, the peak titers were similar to those of Beau-R. Sequence analysis of the S genes from the P 7 -Vero isolates identified several nucleotide substitutions that may be involved in further conferment of tropism for Vero cells (Table 1) ; BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero C 22255 T results in the amino acid substitution P 630 S, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero G 20584 A results in the amino acid substitution G 73 S, and BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 617 S, -L 578 F-N 617 S, and -N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero were all found to have a common substitution, A 22962 C, resulting in the amino acid substitution Q 866 H in the M41 S2 subunit. BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero had several other substitutions; G 21709 A resulted in V 448 I, and C 22342 A resulted in P 659 T and a mixed population of C 22099 T corresponding to the first engineered amino acid modification in the M41 S2 subunit L 578 F. The rIBV appears to be losing the L 857 F modification, resulting in a mixed population at C 22936 T. Interestingly, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero was found to gain the Beaudettespecific amino acid L 578 F, which was introduced into the M41 S2 subunit in some of the rIBVs.",

As the Beaudette-specific motif surrounds the S2= cleavage site, the susceptibility of rIBVs containing the BSM to proteolytic cleavage was investigated. CK cells were infected with BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK, BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK, or parent virus Beau-R, BeauR-M41(S), or M41-CK for 24 h and then lysed, and the proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S2 antibody (Fig. 8) . A clear S2= cleavage product was observed in the Beau-R sample, but this was absent in the BeauR-M41(S), M41-CK, and BeauR-S-MM samples, which do not contain the BSM and are unable to grow in Vero cells. A faint band corresponding to the S2= cleavage product was also observed in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM sample, indicating that proteolytic cleavage at the S2= site within the BSM may play a role in extending the host tropism of Beau-R. The faint band generated by BeauR-M41-S-BSM in comparison with that produced by Beau-R may indicate that proteolytic processing is not as efficient in the recombinant spike glycoprotein. This could be due to subtle differences in the tertiary or quaternary structures of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM spike glycoprotein resulting in steric hindrance of the protease acting at the S2= site. The size of the S2= cleavage product is smaller than expected when analyzed by Western blotting. It is possible that the band that we observed at about 30 kDa may be a breakdown product of the S2= cleavage product or that the size of the S2= cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this band was observed only in samples infected with rIBV containing the Beaudette-specific motif surrounding the S2= cleavage site, indicating that this is where cleavage occurs, so its production may be involved in the extended tropism of Beau-R.",

Production of IBV vaccines in embryonated eggs is expensive and cumbersome, with each egg producing only a small volume of allantoic fluid from which the virus is isolated. Furthermore, the supply of embryonated eggs is not guaranteed to be reliable, which may seriously affect the production of required vaccines. As the demand for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines rises, the supply of embryonated eggs for the production of other vaccines may be reduced. Another concern about the use of embryonated eggs is the possible presence of adventitious viruses, which may compromise the vaccine stocks or cause pathology in the vaccinated chickens.",

It is possible that inefficient conformational changes leading to a reduction in the rate of viral entry into host cells may be responsible for the lag in viral growth kinetics for some of the rIBVs with modified spike glycoproteins at early times in the course of infection.

While the S1 subunit of IBV contains the receptor binding domain and is responsible for binding to host cells, it was determined that infectivity for Vero cells is conferred by the Beaudette S2 subunit, in particular, the Beaudette-specific motif 686 SRRKRSLIE 694 surrounding the S2= cleavage site. Although there is a clear indication of the involvement of the Beaudette-specific motif in the ability of Beau-R to replicate on Vero cells, the addition of other Beaudettespecific amino acids within the S2 subunit or mutations introduced by serial passage in Vero cells were able to further increase the growth kinetics of the rIBVs on Vero cells. These additional mutations may serve to optimize the structure of the recombinant S glycoprotein. Interestingly, the Beaudette-specific motif does not appear to confer the ability to grow on BHK-21 cells in the same way (data not shown), indicating that there may be other regions of the S glycoprotein responsible for the extended host range of Beau-R in mammalian cells other than Vero cells.",

            "text": "The Beaudette-specific motif has two putative mechanisms to permit infectivity for Vero cells: either by facilitating binding to additional host attachment factors (63) or as an additional protease cleavage site (64) . It is possible that both activities may play a role in the extended tropism of Beaudette in vitro. The results of this study suggest that IBV Beaudette employs a mechanism of entry into Vero cells different from that into CK cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that rIBVs containing the Beaudette-specific motif are susceptible to cleavage at the S2= site, whereas the rIBVs containing the equivalent sequence from M41 are not cleaved at the S2= site. The efficiency of this cleavage appears to be lower in the rIBVs containing the BSM than in Beau-R, however, which may be due to differences in the tertiary or quaternary structure between the spike glycoproteins, resulting in the S2= site being less accessible to the protease. The S2= cleavage product of 472 amino acids equates to about 52 kDa if you assume a linear relationship between molecular weight and the size of the protein. The S2 is glycosylated and palmitoylated, which alters the size and which can distort the protein coils that form when the protein is denatured using SDS. We consistently see a band of about 30 kDa in Beau-R-infected samples. It is possible that this band may be a breakdown product of the S2= cleavage product or that the size of the S2= cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. Nonetheless, this study contributes to the mounting evidence from other coronaviruses that cleavage at the S2= site is involved in entry and that this region plays a role in fusion activation (64, 66, 67, 69) .",

Beau-R also contains a Beaudette-specific sequence not found in M41. (B) The sequences of the ectodomains of the S2 subunit of IBV strains Beau-CK (GenBank accession number AJ311317), M41 (GenBank accession number X04722), 4/91 (UK) (GenBank accession number JN192154), and QX L1148 (GenBank accession number KY933090) are shown. There are 19 amino acid differences between the S2 subunits of Beau-R and M41-CK. The Beaudette-specific motif is labeled with a horizontal line. A black box surrounds each amino acid change made in the spike glycoproteins of the recombinant viruses generated in this study, and the amino acid positions are shown above.",
