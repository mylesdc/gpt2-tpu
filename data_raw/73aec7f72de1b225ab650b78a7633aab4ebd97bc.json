            "text": "Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are one of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that restrict entry of enveloped viruses, including flaviviruses, filoviruses and retroviruses. It has been recently reported that in U87 glioblastoma cells IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 entry in a co-receptor-dependent manner, that is, IFITM1 is more inhibitory on CCR5 tropic HIV-1 whereas IFITM2/3 confers a greater suppression of CXCR4 counterparts. However, how entry of HIV-1 with distinct co-receptor usage is modulated by different IFITM orthologs in physiologically relevant CD4 + T cells and monocytes/macrophages has not been investigated in detail. Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4 + HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2, CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL, dual tropic 89.6 virus, as well as a panel of 32 transmitted founder (T/F) viruses, with a consistent order of potency, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1. Consistent with previous reports, we found that some CCR5-using HIV-1 isolates, such as AD8 and JRFL, were relatively resistant to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3, although the effect can be cell-type dependent. However, in no case have we observed that IFITM1 had a stronger inhibition on entry of any HIV-1 strains tested, including those of CCR5-using T/Fs. We knocked down the endogenous IFITMs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4 + T cells and observed that, while this treatment did greatly enhance the multiple-round of HIV-1 replication but had modest effect to rescue the single-round HIV-1 infection, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection is in viral producer cells, rather than in target cells to block viral entry. Overall, our results argue against the idea that IFITM proteins distinguish co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to inhibit entry but emphasize that the predominant role of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in producer cells that intrinsically impair the viral infectivity.",

            "text": "Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been shown to be essential restriction factors against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses (reviewed in [1, 2] ), including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [3] . Recently, we and others discovered that IFITMs not only block HIV-1 entry into target cells but also and more potently, diminish HIV-1 infectivity in viral producer cells [4] [5] [6] . The current proposed model for the mechanism of action of IFITM proteins on HIV-1 infectivity includes negative imprinting, in which IFITMs are incorporated into virions [4, 5] , as well as impaired HIV-1 envelope (Env) processing [6] . Subsequent investigations showed that IFITM proteins can distinctly inhibit HIV-1 with different tropisms; in particular, it was shown that some CCR5 tropic viruses, including those of transmitted founders (T/Fs), were relatively resistant to IFITM-mediated impairment of HIV-1 infectivity and entry [7, 8] . Interestingly, Neil and colleagues reported that IFITM1 is more potent to restrict entry of CCR5 viruses whereas IFITM2 and IFITM3 are more effective to block entry of CXCR4 viruses, at least in U87 cells [8] . These results are apparently different from some of the earlier reports in Jurkat cells, SupT1 cells and HeLa TZM-bl cells [6, 9] , where IFITM2 and IFITM3 were shown to be generally more potent than IFITM1 to inhibit HIV-1, regardless of co-receptor usage.",

We observed that HIV-1 GFP-pseudotypes bearing the Env of NL4.3, HXB2, 89.6, AD8 or JRFL showed a similar trend of inhibition by three IFITM orthologs, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1, regardless of their CXCR4 or CCR5 tropisms ( Figure 1B ). The extent of inhibition was approximately 2~3 fold for IFITM2 and IFITM3 and <30% for IFITM1, respectively, which were comparable to the original report by Neil and colleagues [8] . We noticed that, while the CCR5-using JRFL HIV-1 was relatively less sensitive to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3 compared with the CXCR4-using viruses HXB2 and NL4.3, another CCR5-using HIV-1 primary isolate, AD8, was as sensitive as HXB2 and NL4.3 to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3. In no case, however, have we found that IFITM1 exhibited a stronger inhibition of any viruses, including CCR5 viruses, than IFITM2 and IFITM3 did ( Figure 1B ,C). Note that the efficiency of entry by the dual tropic 89.6 in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells was extremely low, as measured by GFP-positive cell population (data not shown); therefore, the result was not informative thus excluded from Figure 1C .",

The HIV-inGLuc system is highly sensitive and quantitative compared to the classical colorimetric assays, including fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry; and because the expression of inGLuc solely relies on infection of new target cells, attributed to an insertion of antisense orientation of Gluc cassette in reporter vector [14] , this assay measures a single-round HIV-1 infection. Similar to GFP-expressing lentiviral pseudotypes described above, we produced inGLuc-reporter viruses by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with an HIV-inGLuc (Env-deficient) vector, a packaging vector \u22068.2 encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol and all accessory/regulatory genes, along with the Env construct of interest, including murine leukemia virus (MLV) 10A1 Env constructs; 10 A1 was known to be refractory to IFITM restriction; hence, it served as a negative control [10] . As shown in Figure 1D ,E, IFITM2 and IFITM3 were more potent than IFITM1 to suppress infection of CXCR4-tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2 in U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells, infection of CCR5-tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells, as well as infection of the dual tropic HIV-1 89.6 in both U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cells, regardless their co-receptor usages. As would be expected, IFITM2 and IFITM3 showed no significant effect on 10A1 MLV infection, yet IFITM1 slightly enhanced 10A1 infection ( Figure 1D ,E). Similar to GFP-expressing HIV-1 pseudotypes shown above, we found that JRFL was relatively resistant to IFITMs, that is, almost no inhibition by IFITM1 and a modest inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3 ( Figure 1E ).",

Because short-hairpin RNAs against IFITMs (shRNA IFITMs) exhibit cross-knockdown activities against different IFITM orthologs [6] , making the evaluation of the contributions of individual IFITMs to HIV-1 entry challenging, we decided to knock down all three IFITMs altogether by using a mixed pool of shRNAs and compared the overall function of IFITMs on infection of CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV-1 strains, i.e., NL4.3 and AD8, respectively. Human PBMCs of two healthy donors were transiently transduced with lentiviral pseudovirions expressing a mixed pool of human IFITM shRNAs (IFITM1, 2 and 3) and the IFITM knockdown efficiency, in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b12b, was assessed and confirmed by western blotting shown in Figure 4A . Single-round infection assays using inGLuc pseudotypes showed that in the absence of IFN\u03b12b, knockdown of IFITMs in donor 1 and donor 2 ( Figure 4B ,C) modestly increased HIV-1 NL4.3 entry (~50%), yet more potently elevated entry of AD8 (~2-3-fold). Notably, treatment of PBMCs with IFN\u03b12b decreased NL4.3 and AD8 entry by roughly 2-fold in the shRNA control, yet had very modest effect, approximately 30-50% increase, on PBMCs treated with shRNA IFITMs ( Figure 4B,C) . These results suggested that IFITMs do not significantly contribute to the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry and implied that other ISGs as yet to be discovered in target PBMCs are likely involved in restricting HIV-1 entry. The~2-fold increase in HIV-1 entry as a result of IFITM knockdown was actually consistent with the~2-3-fold inhibition by IFITM overexpression in most cell lines, including U87, HuT78, SupT1 and THP-1 cells shown above.",

We purified human CD4 + T cells from PBMCs of two additional donors, donor 3 and donor 4, and utilized the same set of shRNAs to knock down IFITMs in purified CD4 + cells; cells were subsequently treated with IFN\u03b12b for 24 h before being infected with HIV-inGLuc or infectious NL4.3. The knockdown efficiency of IFITMs was evaluated and confirmed by flow cytometry using mixed anti-IFITM antibodies shown in Figure 4D ,G. We observed that IFITM proteins were indeed induced by type I IFN and that treatment of cells with IFITM shRNAs efficiently knocked down the IFITM protein expression ( Figure 4D ,G). Type I IFN greatly suppressed the replication of HIV-1 NL4.3 in shRNA control cells, that is, by 5-and 10-fold in donor 3 and donor 4, respectively, and knockdown of IFITMs attenuated the IFN-mediated restriction of HIV-1 replication to 2~2.5-fold ( Figure 4E,H) , implicating that IFITMs indeed play a critical role in IFN-mediated restriction of HIV-1 replication. In one-round HIV-1 inGLuc infection assays, which was performed side-by-side, we observed a~2-fold reduction of HIV-1 infection in IFN\u03b12b-treated CD4 + T cells of both donors and that knockdown of IFITMs did not significantly rescue the IFN-mediated inhibition on HIV-1 infection (approximately 50%) ( Figure 4F ,I), suggesting that endogenous IFITMs in target CD + T cells do not significantly contribute to IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry. Taken together, these data, combined with previous reports from our group and others showing that IFITMs potently impaired HIV-1 infectivity in viral producer cells [4] [5] [6] , reinforce the notion that IFITMs do not drastically block HIV-1 entry in target CD4 + cells, which explained, in part, why HIV-1 was originally not found to be sensitive to IFITM restriction by Brass et al.

            "text": "Earlier investigations into the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 have mainly focused on the effects of IFITM proteins on entry in target cells and revealed generally no or moderate inhibition of HIV-1 entry [16, 21] . However, long-term HIV-1 replication assay revealed that IFITM proteins indeed potently suppress HIV-1 spread in SupT1 and other cells, as well as block cell-to-cell transmission [3, 5, 6, 22, 23] . The discrepancy was partially resolved by several recent studies, including ours, showing that IFITM proteins mainly act in viral producer cells and/or in IFITM-bearing virions by diminishing HIV-1 infectivity [4] [5] [6] . In a recent study, our collaborator Chen Liang's group has found that some CCR5 viruses, including AD8, YU-2 and certain T/F viruses, are relatively resistant to IFITM-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity compared with some CXCR4 viruses, such as NL4.3 and dual tropic 89.6 [7] . Interestingly, a recent study by Neil and colleagues reported that the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 entry in target cells is co-receptor dependent, showing that IFITM1 preferentially inhibited entry of CCR5-using HIV-1, including T/F viruses, whereas IFITM2 and 3 were more potent to block entry of CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolates [8] , which differed from some of the previous reports [4, 6, 7, 24] . To clarify the discrepancies for the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 entry, in this work we generated a set of U87.CD4 cell lines expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4, along with different IFITMs similar to those reported by Neil and colleagues and applied GFP as well as intron gaussia luciferase reporter viruses to examine the effects of different IFITMs on the entry of some representative HIV-1 strains and primary isolates. In addition to U87 cells, we also tested the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection of more physiologically relevant human CD4 + T cells and monocytes. We observed that, despite the comparable IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression in different cell line systems, the patterns of IFITM inhibition on HIV-1 entry-as ranked by their potency of inhibition-remained the same, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1, irrespective of the virus strains tested and the cell lines used.",

In this respect, our results may favor a model that HIV-1 fusion predominantly occurs in endosome, as having been shown by Melikyan's group and others, regardless of co-receptor usages [25, 26] . However, we must stress that this mechanism of HIV-1 entry currently remains controversial [27] [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, the subcellular localization of IFITM2 and 3 in endosomes may not necessarily be associated with their inhibition of HIV-1 entry [31, 32] . It is possible that IFITM1 is intrinsically weaker than IFITM2 and IFITM3 to suppress entry of HIV-1 and other viruses [16, 33, 34] , regardless of the viral entry pathways. It has been frequently demonstrated that overexpression of IFITM1 can result in its abundant expression in endolysosomes, in addition to the plasma membrane; however, its effect on entry of many viruses tested still remains poor, supporting that the intrinsic less potent effect of IFITM1 on entry of HIV-1 and other viruses [2, 35] may be due to its extended C-terminal amino acid sequence [6, 36, 37] .",

            "text": "One of the most exciting yet highly controversial findings over the past few years is that T/F viruses are more resistant to the host innate immunity, including restriction by IFITMs [38, 39] . T/F virus is a single variant selected from a diverse pool of HIV-1 quasispecies during the establishment of early infection and is responsible for establishment of primary infection, bottleneck transmission and virus spread [40, 41] . Indeed, we and others have reported that some of HIV-1 T/F strains are relatively resistant to IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral infectivity [7, 8] ; however, the detailed effect of IFITMs in target cells on entry of T/F viruses is less clear. In this work, we analyzed the effects of IFITMs on entry of 20 subtype B and 12 global clades T/F viruses (all CCR5 tropic except two dual tropic viruses) by using the highly sensitive HIV-inGLuc system and we observed that despite their diverse entry efficiency, IFITM1 was consistently less potent in restricting entry of all T/F isolates compared with IFITM2 and IFITM3. These results therefore argue against the finding by Foster et al. that IFITM1 preferentially blocks entry of CCR5 viruses [8] , including T/Fs. Our results may also suggest that T/F viruses utilize the same entry pathway as that of chronic primary isolates and lab-adapted strains. The fact that some T/F viruses were even more potently inhibited by IFITMs, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, compared with those of the lab-adapted NL4.3 and HXB2 viruses, argues that IFITM1 may be inherently less potent to block HIV-1 entry. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of the effect we observed could be cell type-dependent. While it remains to be established whether or not T/F viruses are truly refractory to inhibition by type I IFN, including IFN-induced IFITM proteins, one recent study reported that subtype C T/F viruses failed to show higher replicative capacity and resistance to IFN-mediated inhibition [39] . This finding, along with some others [42] [43] [44] , raise the possibility that T/F viruses may not be universally refractory to type I IFN as having been previously thought [38] . Using the perfectly matched T/F viruses and chronic viruses and testing them in different and more physiologically relevant cell systems are necessary to address this important issue.",

We speculated that this could be due to the expression levels of IFITM proteins in our system versus those in Neil and colleague's study [8] . In addition, the N-terminal FLAG-tag in our IFITMs could contribute to some of the differences observed. Indeed, we have observed that FLAG-tagged IFITMs are approximately 25-30% more potent than their WTs to inhibit HIV-1 infection; however, the order of potency in inhibition for the untagged WT IFITMs and FLAG-IFITMs remains the same, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1. Another possibility, which also needs to be explored, is whether or not some HIV-1 accessory proteins present in pseudotyped viruses could influence the effect of different IFITMs on HIV-1 infection.",

            "text": "In this work, we also examined the role of endogenous IFITMs in HIV-1 entry and compared with their effect on HIV-1 replication in parallel. We found that knockdown of IFITMs had modest effect on rescuing IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry, in contrast to its stronger effect on viral replication. In addition, we showed that the type I IFN itself was not highly effective to block HIV-1 entry, as compared its suppression of HIV-1 replication-based on results from both PBMCs and purified CD4 + T cells. Overall, the results presented here, along with our previous study that compared the functional role of IFITMs in viral producer cells and target cells in parallel [6] , led us to the conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in viral producer cells that diminishes the viral infectivity but not in target cells to block viral entry. This conclusion is also supported by several recent studies [4] [5] [6] and explains, at least in part, why HIV-1 was originally not found to be restricted by IFITMs [16, 21] . ",
