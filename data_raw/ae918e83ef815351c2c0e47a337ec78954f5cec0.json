            "text": "Molecular epidemiology has become an indispensable tool in the diagnosis of diseases and in tracing the infection routes of pathogens. Due to advances in conventional sequencing and the development of high throughput technologies, the field of sequence determination is in the process of being revolutionized. Platforms for sharing sequence information and providing standardized tools for phylogenetic analyses are becoming increasingly important. The database (DB) of the European Union (EU) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever offers one of the world's largest semi-public virus-specific sequence collections combined with a module for phylogenetic analysis. The classical swine fever (CSF) DB (CSF-DB) became a valuable tool for supporting diagnosis and epidemiological investigations of this highly contagious disease in pigs with high socio-economic impacts worldwide. The DB has been re-designed and now allows for the storage and analysis of traditionally used, well established genomic regions and of larger genomic regions including complete viral genomes. We present an application example for the analysis of highly similar viral sequences obtained in an endemic disease situation and introduce the new geographic \"CSF Maps\" tool. The concept of this standardized and easy-to-use DB with an integrated genetic typing module is suited to serve as a blueprint for similar platforms for other human or animal viruses.",

            "text": "The worldwide exchange of genome data from viruses causing severe transboundary diseases is urgently needed in human and veterinary medicine to perform molecular epidemiological investigations in the case of epidemics. Advances in classical molecular techniques such as improved complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and PCR performance have increased the length and quality of sequence reads achieved by Sanger sequencing [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, the implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has revolutionized the genetic typing of pathogens in terms of sensitivity and speed and allows for the rapid determination of complete genome sequences of many viruses and bacteria [4, 5] . The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has recently recommended the inclusion and validation of NGS into the Terrestrial Manual and requests a platform for the collection and management of viral genomic sequences, including genotype assignment with a connection to existing virus-specific sequence databases [6] . Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the most important pig diseases worldwide and is, due to its severe socio-economic impacts, notifiable to the European Union (EU) and the OIE. Successful containment of CSF outbreaks relies on rapid diagnosis, identification of infection routes, efficient control measures, and the exchange of information on regional, national, and international levels. The sequence database (DB) of the EU and OIE Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever (EURL CSF) was a pioneer project, already established in 2000 as a web interface platform for the exchange of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) genome data (Version 1.0) and was further improved by the integration of an easy-to-use sequencing tool for molecular epidemiology in 2006 (Version 2.0) [7, 8] . In past years, laboratory reports of the EURL CSF to the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the EU commission and to the affected member states have routinely included phylogenetic trees generated with this DB and have therefore provided useful information about the causative virus isolate to the authorities. Until now, the DB included sequences of short genome fragments, namely, a partial 5 non-translated region (5 NTR, 150 nt), a partial E2 (190 nt), and a partial NS5B (409 nt) encoding fragment, as proposed in the context of a previous initiative to harmonize CSFV sequencing strategies in 2000 [9] . Since then, the analysis of the complete E2 encoding sequence (1119 nt) was found to be much more suitable in particular for epidemiological research studies and for the differentiation of highly similar virus isolates. This strategy has been already applied at the EURL CSF for recent molecular epidemiological studies on CSFV [10] [11] [12] . In consequence, the sequence DB and the genetic typing module have been re-programmed to facilitate the storage and the phylogenetic analysis of longer genomic sequences. In this study, the structure and the relevant modifications of the CSF-DB are introduced via application examples. Moreover, the possibility of using this DB as a blueprint for other pathogen-specific databases is discussed.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on the genetically variable E2 fragment (190 nt) gives more reliable and timely results. Due to the frequent use of this region for typing in recent decades, applying this strategy is advantageous in that a wealth of sequence information is available. Nevertheless, the increasing availability of longer nucleotide sequences, such as the complete E2 gene (1119 nt) and even full genome sequences (12.3 kB), will further improve the possibilities for high-resolution phylogenetic analyses. The new DB is taking this development into account and-together with the new \"CSF Maps\" tool-is well suited to illustrate geographic and genetic relationships between isolates, thereby providing an improved tool for disease control.",

The Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) is a different database project combining information from several primary databases (e.g., the GenBank sequence database). The ViPR covers a broad range of relevant viral human, animal, and zoonotic pathogens (e.g., hepatitis C, Ebola, dengue, and Zika viruses), allowing also for the comparison and phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences, primarily addressing needs for research activities [18, 19] . The concept of the presented database is to provide information relevant for a specific pathogen and to focus on the needs with respect to the diagnosis and control of a disease. The possibility of including a certain set of sequences in a predefined phylogenetic tree ensures that the dataset is representative for sequences of different genotypes. Furthermore, the use of defined genomic regions for genetic typing allows for an easy comparison of phylogenetic trees generated by different laboratories. Many statistical methods and programs for sequence and phylogenetic analysis are presently available [20] . The approach presented here is easy to use and ensures consistent quality by the same bio-mathematical procedure and the same reference sequence set among all users. This is of particular importance, as phylogenetic trees are often requested for official diagnostic laboratory reports to national authorities and the EU Commission. The usage of a common DB that provides an integrated sequence analysis tool is helpful for individual laboratories and ensures reliability of sequence analysis results.",

The DB has already been successfully applied for bovine viral diarrhea virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (unpublished), which are also RNA viruses with a relatively small genome size. For DNA viruses with large genomes, e.g., pox or herpesviruses, the calculation of multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees on the basis of complete genome sequences would require high server capacities; this limiting factor is independent of the use of a database. Usually, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for such viruses are not calculated for complete genome sequences, but on the basis of partial genomic sequences. Moreover, extending the functionality of the CSF-DB (e.g., no pre-defined reference tree, a changeable number of bootstrap repetitions in phylogenetic analyses, and public access to all stored sequence and isolate information) can easily be done and adapted to the needs and preferences for other applications. Accordingly, the concept of the presented DB can serve as a blueprint for other pathogen-specific databases and sequence analysis platforms.",
