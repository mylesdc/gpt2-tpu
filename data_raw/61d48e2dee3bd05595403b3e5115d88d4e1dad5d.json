Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity.",

Of these independent hits, three share a common molecular scaffold ( [19] and figure 1A ). Since HTS scores of these analogs best matched the target criteria and antiviral activity was highest in this group [19] , we subjected them to further characterization and developmental efforts. Synthetic optimization and structural confirmation of the scaffold returned a lead analog JMN3-003 (figures 1B and S1), which showed potent activity against MeV, a selection of clinically significant members of the para-and orthomyxovirus families, and, albeit to a lesser degree, representatives of positive strand RNA virus (sindbis virus of the Alphaviridae) and DNA virus (vaccinia virus of the Poxviridae) families (figure 1C, inhibitory concentrations for a larger panel of myxovirus family members are summarized in table 1). As observed for the primary hit compound, metabolic activity of different established cell lines exposed to JMN3-003 was unchanged at 75 mM, the highest assessable concentration based on solubility of the substance in growth media (figure 1D and  table 1 ).

In addition to higher mammalian (HT1080 (ATCC CCL-121), HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), MDCK (ATCC CCL-34)) cell lines, cells of rodent (NIH-3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658), MEL B16 (ATCC CRL-6322), BHK-21 (ATCC CCL-10), CHO (ATCC CCL-61)) and avian (DF-1 (ATCC CRL-12203)) origin were tested, which are all permissive for influenza A/WSN infection (table 2) . While inhibitory concentrations obtained for all higher mammalian cell lines examined were similar, A/WSN inhibition by JMN3-003 was found inactive on some rodent cell lines and when virus was propagated on murine or avian cells (table 2) . However, inhibitory activity extended fully to primary human PBMCs (figure 2). For the latter, inhibition of MeV-Alaska was monitored due to efficient growth of MeV isolates on PBMCs [21] . The host cell species effect of antiviral activity of JMN3-003 is consistent with specific targeting of cellular factors by the compound, while arguing against docking to conserved viral factors or an undesirable promiscuous, unspecific mode of activity.",

Nocodazole interferes with microtubule polymerization [25] , resulting in a G 2 /M arrest, whereas hydroxyurea is thought to lead to an arrest in the G 1 /S-phase through depletion of cellular dNTP pools [26, 27] . To further explore the effect of JMN3-003 on cell cycle progression, we monitored the phosphorylation status of the cdc2-cyclin B kinase after exposure of cells to either the compound, hydroxyurea, nocodazole, or alsterpaullone, a nanomolar small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases that reportedly induces a potent G 1 /Sphase cell cycle arrest [28] . Pivotal in regulating the G 2 /M transition, cdc2-cyclin B kinase is inactivated through phosphorylation during the G 2 -phase. Accumulation in its phosphorylated form thus indicates a G 1 arrest. As in hydroxyurea-and alsterpaullone-treated controls, exposure of cells to JMN3-003 resulted in increased steady state levels of phosphorylated cdc2cyclin B kinase, supporting a G 1 -phase arrest (figure 4B).",

To explore whether resistance to JMN3-003 could be induced experimentally, we attempted stepwise viral adaptation to growth in the presence of the compound in comparison with the pathogen-specific MeV RdRp inhibitor AS-136A [36] . Following an escalating dose scheme, inhibitor concentrations were doubled when virusinduced cytopathicity became detectable microscopically. While robust resistance to the pathogen-targeted AS-136A control emerged rapidly in an approximate 15 to 20-day time window (tolerated dose at the end of adaptation was $30 mM, equivalent to $100-fold resistance), only marginal increases in the tolerated dose could be detected for JMN3-003 after 90 days of continued viral incubation in the presence of the substance (figure 8). These results are consistent with a host-directed mechanism of action of JMN3-003 and suggest the existence of a systemic barrier that prevents rapid viral escape from inhibition by the article.",

By combining automated library screening [19] with counter screens against a variety of related viral pathogens of the myxovirus families, we have identified a candidate scaffold that, after moderate hit-to-lead chemistry, adheres to the profile of a host-directed antiviral based on several lines of evidence: I) antiviral activity is host cell species-dependent, indicating specific interaction with a distinct host factor rather than a viral component. Host cell-specific activity is incompatible with compound docking to conserved viral factors. For example, carbohydrate structures exposed on viral envelope glycoproteins that are targeted by antiviral lectins such as pradimicin A [62] . Furthermore, it is incompatible with an undesirable unspecific, promiscuous mode of action of the compound [63] ; II) affinities against a panel of human pathogens of the paramyxovirus family as well as laboratory adapted and wild type influenza virus isolates were very similar throughout (average EC 50 concentrations are ,40 nM). Equivalent active concentrations argue against compound docking to distinct viral components and suggest that inhibition of distinct myxovirus families follows the same mechanism of action; III) in vitro adaptation attempts to induce viral resistance were unsuccessful even after extended exposure times to the drug. A full assessment of the frequency of viral escape from inhibition by JMN3-003 will certainly need to include in vivo virus adaptation attempts in suitable animal models, since the rate of resistance build-up may vary between tissue culture and in vivo settings. We nevertheless reliably induced resistance in less than 30 days to a pathogen-directed MeV RdRp inhibitor that was analyzed in parallel, which is fully consistent with our previous experience [36] and provides confidence for the validity of our overall experimental design for viral adaptation.",

Current libraries of chemical analogs of JMN3-003 do not yet permit a definitive conclusion as to whether both activities adhere to discrete structure-activity relationships or are causally linked, but a bulk of experimental data demonstrate that host cell cycle arrest per se has no inhibitory effect on replication of paramyxoviruses such as MeV. Not only does the virus itself induce a G 1 /S-phase arrest in infected T lymphocytes [29, 30] , we also found that exposure of infected cells to alsterpaullone, a potent blocker of G 1 /S-phase cell cycle progression through nanomolar inhibition of cellular cyclindependent kinases [28] , did not affect the extent of virus replication even at concentrations exceeding reported alsterpaullone EC 50 values by more than 1,000-fold. Likewise consistent with the notion that the antiviral activity of JMN3-003 is not based on cell cycle arrest itself, virus inhibition was not restricted to the context of immortalized, rapidly dividing tissue culture cell lines but extended with equal potency to primary human PBMCs.",

            "text": "Recently, accumulating evidence has implicated host cell kinases as regulators of the activity of RdRp complexes of different negative-strand RNA viruses [64] : host cell kinases of the PI3K-Akt pathway manipulate paramyxovirus RdRp activity through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the viral phosphoprotein, an essential component of the RdRp complex. Furthermore, Akt activity itself is upregulated through activation of PI3K during influenza A infection via direct interaction of the viral NS1 protein with PI3K [65, 66] . In the case of MeV, however, published data [67, 68] and our own observations (Krumm and Plemper, unpublished) demonstrate that Akt inhibition causes a moderate reduction in virus release, whereas titers of cell-associated progeny particles remain unchanged. While this rules out the PI3K-Akt pathway as a direct target for JMN3-003, it illuminates the intricate regulatory interactions between pathogen and host, which provide a wealth of possible points of entry for antiviral intervention. Future identification of the molecular target of JMN3-003 carries high potential to further our understanding of these interactions and may conceivably provide a basis for pharmacophore extraction and structure-driven scaffold optimization.",

            "text": "We note that the central sulfur in the JMN3-003 chemical scaffold could potentially render the molecule vulnerable to rapid phase I oxidation and thus compromise both metabolic stability and bioavailability. For instance, it has been reported that flavincontaining monooxygenases [69] , dioxygenases [70] and cytochrome P-450 enzymes [71] catalyze oxidation of alkylaryl sulfides to sulfoxides (R 2 S = O). However, the high stability of JMN3-003 in the presence of human hepatocyte subcellular fractions and human plasma argues against an undesirable short in vivo half-life of the substance. This is corroborated by good metabolic stability of the structurally similar HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor RDEA-806 [72, 73] , which shares the central 2-thio-acetamide connector with JMN3-003 and has achieved success in clinical trials: the compound was well tolerated in both Phase 1 and 2a studies after single or multiple oral doses and showed no drugrelated CNS toxicity [72, 73] , creating a clinical precedence for the applicability of the broader scaffold. Although RDEA-806 follows a different mechanism of action than JMN3-003 and lacks any anti-paramyxovirus activity, the structural similarities provide sufficient confidence for the overall developmental potential of the JMN3-003 class to recommend it as a promising candidate for advanced synthetic optimization towards preclinical validation and development.",

All MeV infected wells received in addition fusion inhibitory peptide (FIP, Bachem) at 100 mM to prevent premature breakdown of the monolayer through viral CPE in the vehicle control wells prior to RNA extraction. Twenty-four (influenza A/WSN) or forty (recMeV-Edm) hours post-infection, total RNA was prepared from all wells using the QIAcube automated extractor and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). For RNA samples originating from recMeV-Edm infected cells, antigenomespecific primer 5-GGCTCCCTCTGGTTGT or oligo-dT primer (viral mRNA and GAPDH quantification) were used for cDNA priming. In the case of samples originating from influenza A/WSN infected cells, primers for cDNA synthesis were 5-AGTAGAAA-CAAGGTAGTTT (antigenome) or oligo-dT (mRNA and canine GAPDH). Real-time reactions were carried out using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system and iQ Fast SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad). Probes were a fragment at the N/P junction (MeV antigenomic RNA, 5-AACCAGGTCCACACAG and 5-GTTG TCTGATATTTCTGAC), a fragment of MeV F mRNA (5-GTCCACCATGGGTCTCAAGGTGAACGTCTC and 5-CAGTTATTGAGGAGAGTT), a fragment of human GAPDH (SABiosciences proprietary primers), a fragment of influenza A/WSN segment seven (influenza A/WSN antigenomic RNA, 5-tagctccagtgctggtct and 5-AAGGCCCTCCTTTCAGTCC), and a fragment of canine GAPDH (Qiagen proprietary primer). Melting curves were generated at the end of each reaction to verify amplification of a single product. To calculate DDC T values, CT values obtained for each sample were normalized for GAPDH as reference and then DC T values of JMN3-003-treated samples normalized for the FIP-treated controls. Final quantification was based on three independent experiments in which each treatment condition and RT primer setting were assessed in triplicate. To assess the relative quantities of cellular mRNA, 9610 5 HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of JMN3-003 (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 mM final concentration), AS-136A (25 mM), Actinomycine D (5 mg/ml), or vehicle only for six hours at 37uC, followed by preparation of total RNA as described above. Quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR was again achieved using the TaqMan Fast Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) combined with proprietary primer and probe sets specific for Induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1-(MCL1), MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP1), and ankyrin repeat and SOCS boxcontaining protein 7-(ASB7) encoding mRNAs (Applied Biosystems). Samples were standardized for GAPDH as before and normalized values expressed relative to the equally analyzed vehicle-treated controls.",

Equally infected cells treated with the virus polymerase targeted RdRp inhibitor AS-136A were examined in parallel. When cultures became over confluent, cells were reseeded for continued incubation in the presence of the same compound concentration as before. At detection of extensive cell-to-cell fusion, cellassociated viral particles were harvested, diluted 10-fold and used for parallel infections of fresh cell monolayers in the presence of compound at unchanged and doubled concentrations. Cultures treated with the highest compound concentrations in which virusinduced cytopathicity became detectable were used for further adaptation. The approach was terminated after 90 days of continued incubation or when virus-induced cytopathicity was readily detectable in the presence of 30 mM compound in accordance with previous results [36] .
