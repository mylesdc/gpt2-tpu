Spatial dynamics of the fatal zoonotic disease rabies among countries of the Middle East and surrounding regions is poorly understood. An improved understanding of virus distribution is necessary to direct control methods. Previous studies have suggested regular trans-boundary movement, but have been unable to infer direction. Here we address these issues, by investigating the evolution of 183 rabies virus isolates collected from over 20 countries between 1972 and 2014. We have undertaken a discrete phylogeographic analysis on a subset of 139 samples to infer where and when movements of rabies have occurred. We provide evidence for four genetically distinct clades with separate origins currently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. Introductions of these viruses have been followed by regular and multidirectional trans-boundary movements in some parts of the region, but relative isolation in others. There is evidence for minimal regular incursion of rabies from Central and Eastern Asia. These data support current initiatives for regional collaboration that are essential for rabies elimination.",

As a zoonotic disease, control of infection in the reservoir has been proven the most efficient route to reduction of human cases. In some regions, the epidemiology is well understood, with either dogs or wildlife known to be the primary reservoir and with little or no movement from, or into other regions. This is not the case in the Middle East, where rabies is underreported in animals and humans, there is little laboratory confirmation of infection, and the extent of rabies spread from country to country is not known. Previous studies have demonstrated transboundary movement of rabies but have been limited by a low number of available samples from some countries, and the direction of spread has been difficult to estimate. Here we use rabies virus partial genome sequences of 183 viruses from over 20 countries, combined with geographical and temporal information, to reconstruct the evolution of rabies viruses circulating in the Middle East. The results reveal an apparent barrier to spread between some regions but regular movement between others. These analyses will support policy on rabies control by indicating the relative importance of local control and animal movement restrictions when allocating resources.",

Although the majority of lyssavirus species are associated with bats, rabies virus (RABV) has successfully adapted to terrestrial carnivores on multiple occasions [3, 4] and causes an estimated 70,000 deaths each year [5] . The majority of rabies cases in humans are caused by the bite of infected domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), but rabies can persist in both domestic dog and wildlife reservoirs [6] . In addition to the morbidity and mortality burden, costs are incurred through the necessity for provision of post-exposure prophylaxis and surveillance in rabies endemic areas, leading to an annual global economic cost estimated at over 500 million dollars [7, 8] . Concerted control efforts in many regions have demonstrated the feasibility of rabies elimination in carnivores [6, 7, 9] . These control efforts are dependent on local epidemiology of the disease which will vary from region to region, depending on differing ecological and sociological factors [10] .",

These figures are heavily influenced by variation in surveillance and reporting in different countries, yet reflect an on-going burden of rabies in the region [16] [17] [18] . Although many countries in the Middle East collate and report human rabies cases, routine surveillance and reporting of animal rabies is less systematic, often relying on local awareness and resources with associated potential biases [16, 17, 19] .",

            "text": "There are multiple historical reports of disease consistent with rabies throughout the history of civilisation in the Middle East (reviewed by [19] and [20] ). Reconstruction of viral evolution using, molecular phylogenetics, suggests that the spread of RABV through human mediated dispersal from Europe is a dominant factor in the current epidemiology of rabies in the Middle East [4, 21, 22] . Dating this spread of a widely distributed lineage of RABVs, known as the 'cosmopolitan' lineage, using molecular clock analyses concurs with this scenario. The estimated date of divergence, 200-300 years ago, coincides with a period of increased human movements, increasing human population, and increasing domestic dog population associated with urbanisation in the 18 th century. Current epidemiological evidence also supports this, suggesting dog rabies predominates, at least in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran, [16, 17, 19, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and also remains a concern in some central Asian countries and in the Caucasus region [18, 28] . However, the historical reports of disease consistent with rabies in the Middle East pre-date this relatively recent spread of the cosmopolitan lineage, and additional separate rabies lineages appear to be spreading in neighbouring regions which may also be circulating in the Middle East [16, 18, 29] . Throughout the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia, dogs are considered the principal reservoir of rabies, with a genetically distinct lineage of RABV predominating, indicating prolonged circulation without mixing from other regions [30] [31] [32] [33] . In addition, more recently a lineage of RABVs related to those endemic in Arctic regions has emerged, and then become the dominant lineage in parts of South Asia [29, 31, 34, 35] . Establishing whether rabies in the Middle East today is, for example, the result of ancient lineages that have persisted in the region, or the result of incursion from other areas is essential in targeting sustainable control methods.",

Here we have taken a broader and more comprehensive perspective on circulating RABV lineages in this particular region of the world by collecting RABV isolates from as many Middle East countries as possible as well as neighbouring regions. Through international collaborative efforts, we have obtained or generated sequence data for a panel of 183 RABVs spanning 40 years and from over 20 countries including previously un-sampled areas.

Sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 (version 1.2). The length of sequence available for analysis varied among isolates, but a 400 base pair region of the nucleoprotein gene was chosen for further analyses as it was common to 171 of the selected sequences. A phylogenetic analysis of all these 171 virus sequences was implemented using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in the BEAST packagev1.8.0 [43] . A TN93 nucleotide substitution model with rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites (Gamma +I) were determined to best fit the data using Akaike Information Criterion in MEGA 6.0. A relaxed and strict molecular clock model with either constant or Bayesian skyline population prior were used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for 100,000,000 iterations, sampling every 10,000 states to give effective sample sizes of over 200. Molecular clock and population coalescent models were compared using a modified Akaike information criterion (AICM) in Tracer v1.5 on a subset of 137 sequences, as described previously [44] (Table 1) , and maximum clade credibility trees were annotated using TreeAnnotator (v1.8.0) after 10% of trees were discarded. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were then visualised using Fig Tree (v1.4.0) (Fig. 1) . A strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population prior gave the lowest AICM and were therefore used for the estimates of divergence dates. Neighbourjoining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions were also undertaken on the data set in MEGA6 [45] for comparison with Bayesian reconstructions. A neighbour joining tree was derived from p-distances with 1000 bootstrap replicates and a maximum likelihood tree using the same TN93 +G +I evolutionary model as used in the Bayesian analyses, the Nearest-neighbour inference heuristic and 100 bootstrap replicates. NJ and ML trees were visualized in FigTree (v1.4.0).",

Samples were allocated to one of eight locations based on the country of isolation (Europe, Caucasus, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Central Asia, Africa, Turkey) ( Table 2 ). These location groups were chosen to give approximately equal numbers of sequences per region and were based on geographical proximity of the recorded countries of origin. A data partition was generated from the location allocated to each sequence, meaning that each sequence is therefore identified by nucleotide sequence, date of isolation and location of origin. The same nucleotide substitution (TN93+G+I), strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population coalescent models were used. The probable locations of each ancestral node were then reconstructed in the ensuing Bayesian MCMC analysis and displayed on the maximum clade credibility tree annotated using TreeAnotator (v1.8.0) and visualised using FigTree (v1.4.0) (Fig. 2) . The strength of association between phylogenetic relationships and location of virus origin was assessed using an association index (AI) [46] . A null data set was created by randomisation of phylogeny and location data and an index of association between phylogeny and location in the observed data was compared to the equivalent from the null data set. The posterior set of trees produced by the Bayesian simulation was analysed with BaTS software (after burn-in was removed), to incorporate uncertainty in calculation of the AI [47] . Ratios between the AI for the data under test, and AI for the null data set give an indication of the strength of association between genetic and spatial information. Ratios approaching one suggest that genetically related viruses are spatially homogenous, whereas low AI ratios imply a strong association between location and phylogenetic relationships.",

            "text": "The first written record of disease consistent with rabies associated with dogs comes from Mesopotamia, a region corresponding to modern day Iraq [16, 20] . Rabies continues to be a significant public and animal health issue in the region almost 4000 years later. We found no evidence that currently circulating strains were direct descendants of virus ancestors that occurred in the region 4000 years ago. In contrast, these analyses support at least one introduction of rabies from Europe with subsequent spread, albeit on a markedly different timescale, in the last 150 years. Indeed, estimates of the origin of all RABVs currently circulating in nonflying mammals are as recent as 1000 years ago. Our estimates of viral evolutionary rates in the partial nucleoprotein gene sequence concur with these previous analyses [4, 32, 36, 50] . It is possible that ancestors of these ancient viruses are still circulating undetected, though a much more parsimonious explanation is that these ancient RABVs have been replaced by contemporary viruses [4, 51] . A further consideration is that there is likely to be variability in selection pressures over time that nucleotide substitution models are unable to properly account for. This variability can lead to gross underestimates of the origins of viral clades which could explain the discrepancy between the historical records and molecular dating for RABV origins [52] . There is a clear and strongly supported distinction between those viruses circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan (Arctic-Like 1b), and those further west. Inclusion of recent isolates from Afghanistan add to previous studies [29, 31, 53] demonstrating that the dominant lineage in Pakistan and Afghanistan is closely related to Arctic RABVs. With the exception of two viruses detected in Iran also from the Arctic-like lineage, there is an apparent barrier to spread of the Arctic-like lineage at approximately 60 degrees longitude, corresponding to the Iranian border. Similarly, the Cosmopolitan lineage viruses appear to have spread widely to the west of 60 degrees longitude but not to the East, and it is currently unclear why. There is evidence that the RABV within the 'Cosmopolitan' lineage that are closely related to Chinese street strains are due to poorly attenuated vaccines [54] . Natural barriers such as high mountain ranges are unlikely to serve as a complete explanation here considering the fact that Arctic-like lineages appear able to cross the Himalaya [29, 53] . The east of Iran is much less densely populated than the west, with large tracts of uninhabited land. With good evidence for human mediated dispersal of dog rabies in other regions [48] , human movements are likely to play a role in the Middle East. The nomadic pastoralist communities in parts of Iran and Central Asia that keep 'choupan' watch dogs [55] would be a potential route of trans-boundary movement of rabies, and also wildlife such as jackal (Canis aureus) and wolf (Canis lupus) are able to move freely across borders. Whether the Arctic-like lineage now dominant in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India continues to spread remains to be seen, but this apparent barrier to recent rabies spread between Iran and Afghanistan/Pakistan could be extremely important and deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "Wildlife rabies presents a complex challenge, as demonstrated by the expensive and prolonged reduction of fox rabies in Western Europe through oral vaccination with live attenuated rabies vaccines [9] . In addition, as we have demonstrated here, wildlife and dog rabies are not as distinct as could be expected from this Western European experience [9, 61, 62] . For example, lineage B is wildlife-associated, but descendants of that lineage are now in dogs in Turkey and Azerbaijan. It is not possible to distinguish reliably with these data whether the samples are the result of repeated spill over from a wildlife reservoir or whether they represent maintenance of rabies in dogs. This is a critical question in rabies control, as demonstrated in parts of Africa where elimination of rabies in domestic dogs has led to the reduction of rabies in wildlife [63] . Both wildlife and dog rabies continue to be reported in Azerbaijan and Turkey, and epidemiological studies in Turkey and Israel strongly support spill over from wildlife [27, [64] [65] [66] [67] . Although control of dogs remains a priority from a public health perspective, eliminating rabies will require control in all reservoirs. Fortunately, with the advent of rapid and affordable sequencing [68] , and increased diagnostic testing and surveillance capacity in resource limited countries, it should be possible to resolve this important issue and establish whether there is independent maintenance of rabies in wildlife in these countries [69] .",

Wolves are not considered a natural reservoir due to their social structure and demography [72] but are an important vector of rabies to humans. For example, wolf bites historically featured disproportionately as the cause of human rabies cases in Russia, responsible for up to 56% of human cases toward the end of the 19 th century [73] . The large size and ferocity of rabid wolves may lead to a disproportionate number of people and domestic animals affected, but also increase the likelihood of the event being detected and reported. With evidence of recent interbreeding between wolves and shepherd dogs in the Caucasus, and now the evidence for a dog associated strain in a wolf in Syria, there is potential for more complex reservoir dynamics [74] . Again, continued improvement of systematic surveillance and international reporting will help resolve these questions [16] [17] [18] 39] .",

            "text": "As with all studies using routine sampling for rabies, these data are limited by sporadic and inconsistent sample selection. This ad-hoc nature of most animal rabies sampling predisposes to bias towards animals of economic value, or those most likely to come into contact with humans. We cannot rule out the possibility of failing to sample all currently circulating lineages, nor account for the effect on the phylogeographic analysis of lineages that have become extinct. For example, epidemiological data supports the elimination of dog rabies from Europe in the latter part of the 20 th century and those viruses are not represented here. The number and host species of samples from each country must also not be over-interpreted due to possible bias from differences in sampling strategy and the relative accessibility of samples from domestic animals or wildlife. For the discrete phylogeographic and reservoir host analyses, data were deliberately allocated into groups (regions, dog/wildlife) to improve the power of the analyses, at the expense of resolution. The countries were grouped based on geographic location and to give approximately equal numbers of sequences per group. Limited location data were available for many of the sequences (country level only) making continuous phylogeography unsuitable here, but if further location data were available the details of rabies dispersal would lend themselves to quantitative phylogeographic analyses. Considering this fact the distribution of RABV lineages identified in this study as shown in Fig. 4 are an approximation based on limited sequence location data. Nevertheless, mapping of the lineages allowed a more comprehensive view on the presumed geographic distribution in the Middle East that would be obtained from phylogenetic trees alone (Figs. 1, 2 ). Our analyses were limited by available sequence length, with many of the sequences from historical samples having only a partial nucleoprotein gene sequence available and no original sample available for further sequencing. Comparison of relationships to those inferred using other regions such as the G-L intergenic region used in previous studies was therefore not possible. While this may restrict resolution, the analyses produced phylogenetic trees with strong posterior support for key nodes allowing reliable interpretation of those nodes, and major differences in relationships would not be expected, based on results from previous studies [38, 75] .",

Therefore adequate vaccine coverage in owned dogs should remain a priority [76] . However, these data show regular host switching and repeated trans-boundary movement of rabies demonstrating that long term control will require a more detailed understanding of dog demographics and human movements, a high resolution assessment of the role of wildlife and cross-species transmission in the maintenance of rabies in the region and a regional approach to rabies control.
