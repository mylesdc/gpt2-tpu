            "text": "It is challenging to find genes with stable transcripts for use as reference genes for quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) during viral infection. Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is known to globally shut off host gene transcription in Sf21 cells and to modify their cytoskeletons. In this study, seven host genes were selected for validation as references for gene expression experiments using qRT-PCR. Two of them, ecdysoneless (ECD) and myosin showed stable RNA levels in our previous microarray study at 6, 12, and 24 hpi for both genes and 48 hpi for ECD. The others, actin, tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 28S ribosome (28S), are commonly employed as reference genes for qRT-PCR. Ribosomal protein L35 (L35) gene was selected to test if ribosomal protein genes show stable RNA transcript levels similar to 28S and 18S rRNA and to validate the microarray data. In addition to 28S, previously known to have stable transcript levels, qRT-PCR showed that ECD transcript levels remained constant throughout the time course of AcMNPV infection. Transcripts of cytoskeleton genes such as actin, tubulin, and myosin declined dramatically as the infection progressed. GAPDH and L35 transcripts also declined over time. These results indicate that ECD is a reliable reference gene for qRT-PCR experiments during AcMNPV infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Although 28S could be used as a reference gene for these experiments, it is less useful than ECD because of its abundance, which might make it difficult to establish an accurate baseline value for data analysis.",

            "text": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for accurate measurements of gene expression. However, qRT-PCR is extremely sensitive necessitating careful selection of an internal control gene with stable transcripts. Genes involved in basic cell maintenance processes are expected to maintain stable expression levels among different tissues and conditions; these ''housekeeping'' genes, have long been used as control or ''normalization'' genes [1] . However, transcript levels of many of these genes varied in response to tissue, cell lines or experimental conditions. For example transcripts of the classical reference genes, beta actin (b-actin) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), varied greatly during bacterial and viral infection. Actin and GAPDH RNA levels showed .20-35 fold change in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with tuberculosis antigens [2] . b-actin transcript levels fluctuated in different human cell lines infected with coronavirus, yellow fever virus, human herpesvirus-6, cytomegalovirus, or camel poxvirus, indicating that b-actin is not a suitable reference gene for these virus-infected cells [3] . Actin and GAPDH transcript levels also varied widely under conditions such as hypoxia [4] , presence of specific proteins [5] or diseases, such as asthmatic airways [6] .",

            "text": "Because variations in reference-gene RNA levels between different samples will compromise the reliability of qRT-PCR analysis, it was suggested that more than one stably expressed reference gene should be used to avoid misinterpreting gene expression profiles [1] . Moreover it was found that no gene is capable of maintaining constant levels of expression under all conditions; making it necessary to evaluate reference genes for each new experimental condition [7] . This is particularly important when studying host gene expression in virus-infected cells because viruses manipulate cellular protein expression and interfere with the basic host cell pathways such as cell cycle, metabolism, DNA replication and transcription to favor their own replication [8, 9, 10] . In the case of baculovirus-infected cells, host gene expression showed global down-regulation by 12-18 hour post infection (hpi) in Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected B. mori BmN-4 cells [11] . In Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)-infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells, actin, histone, and heat shock 70 mRNAs were greatly reduced between 12 and 18 hpi and eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E mRNAs decreased between 12 and 24 hpi [12, 13] . We previously reported that AcMNPV infection of Sf21 cells caused a substantial decline in transcript levels of nearly all host genes represented on a microarray (approximately 11,000 ESTs) from 12 to 24 hpi [10] . In addition, differential display analysis showed a decrease in host mRNA levels between 12-24 hpi in AcMNPV-infected Sf9 cells [13, 14, 15] . In this study, we evaluated seven candidate reference genes, including four of the commonly used housekeeping genes (actin, GADPH, tubulin and 28S), for normalizing qRT-PCR in AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells.",

Previously 28S rRNA was shown to be a promising reference gene to normalize qRT-PCR data in baculovirus-infected cells and for infections by other insect DNA viruses such as Musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus [10, 20] . In this study, 28S rRNA showed the lowest Ct score and least variation in RNA levels during viral infection, confirming the value of 28S rRNA as a reference for normalizing qRT-PCR gene expression data for AcMNPV-infected S. frugiperda cells. However 28S rRNA is not optimal as a reference gene because it is so much more abundant than potential target mRNA transcripts. This makes it difficult to correctly subtract the baseline value in real-time RT-PCR data analysis, which may yield inaccurate conclusions [25] .",

In fact, the greatest variation in mRNA levels in this study was for b-actin, one of the most commonly used reference genes. This result is consistent with a previous study in which northern blot analysis showed a substantial decrease in actin mRNA between 12 and 18 hpi in AcMNPV-infected S. frugiperda cells [12] . The microarray data showed that actin was down-regulated by 1.2, 16, and 75 fold at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively (unpublished data). These results indicate that b-actin is a poor choice as a qRT-PCR reference gene in AcMNPV infected S. frugiperda cells. We also observed significant drops in both tubulin and GAPDH transcript levels by 12 hpi, indicating that neither is suitable for use as a reference gene in AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells. However, each of these genes may be useful for normalizing qRT-PCR experiments in other situations involving infected insects or insect Table 1 . Each value represents two technical replicates of each of four biological replicates. Standard deviation is indicated by bars. 28S gene was used as internal control for normalization and to calculate the relative expression based on 2 2DDCt method [19] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108516.g003 cells. For example, tubulin may be suitable for normalizing data in an AcMNPV-infected Lymantria dispar cell line. Although neither LdFB but not Ld652Y cells are fully permissive for AcMNPV, tubulin transcript levels showed very different patterns [26] . There were no consistent changes (decreases or increases) in tubulin transcript levels observed in AcMNPV-infected LdFB cells over a 72-h measurement period, suggesting tubulin transcripts could be used for normalization of qRT-PCR data from these infections. In contrast, in AcMNPV-infected Ld652Y cells tubulin transcript levels were greatly reduced after 24 hpi indicating it would be a poor choice for normalizing qRT-PCR data in these infections. GAPDH plays a role in energy metabolism and is one of the most frequently used reference genes [27] . However, in this study GAPDH transcript levels declined significantly by 12 hpi in AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells. But in bacteria-challenged honeybees, GAPDH transcript levels remained constant [28] . Thus while GAPDH is not suitable for normalizing qRT-PCR data from AcMNPV-infected S. frugiperda cells, it should not be rejected for other experimental situations.",

ECD transcript levels were the least variable of all of the genes evaluated by the qRT-PCR over the course of AcMNPV infection in Sf21 cells in this study, as they were in our previous microarray study [10] . How ECD transcript levels remain stable during AcMNPV-infection, while most host gene transcript levels decline precipitously is unknown. Myosin, another gene identified as stable in the microarray study, maintained relatively constant transcript levels through 24 hpi before declining by 48 hpi in this qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3) . This suggests it could potentially be used as a reference gene for experimental data collected by 24 hpi or earlier. However, the Ct score for myosin of 33.5 indicates myosin transcripts are relatively low abundance to a level that makes it difficult to be compared with if used as a reference gene.",

We found that both 28S rRNA and ECD transcripts remained relatively constant throughout the course of infection, indicating they can serve as reliable normalizers for qRT-PCR analyses in AcMNPV-infected cells through 48 hpi. However, ECD could be a better choice than 28S RNA for comparing transcripts with midrange numbers during AcMNPV infection. Myosin is also a potential reference gene as its transcript levels were stable up until 24 hpi. However, we recommend that genes with Cts .30 cycles, as myosin, should not be further considered as a reference gene in AcMNPV infected Sf21 cells since their transcripts are close to the noise that results in with the non-template samples [29] . Surprisingly, actin was the most variable gene in our study and should be avoided in gene expression studies involving AcMNPVinfected S. frugiperda cells.",

In contrast, a high SD for the average Ct value of the combination of all of the infection time points indicates that the host gene transcript levels vary over time in the virus-infected cells, making it a poor choice as a reference gene.
