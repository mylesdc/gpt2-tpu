HEK293 cells express minimal endogenous levels of EPAC1 and EPAC2 and have been used as host cells for evaluating the cellular activities of ectopically expressed EPAC proteins in an isoform-specific manner 28 . Activation of EPAC1 or EPAC2 in these cell lines by cAMP elevating agents leads to the accumulation of Flag-Rap1-GTP, which can be captured by RalGDS-RBD immobilized in a nickel-coated 96-well microplate. The levels of active Flag-Rap1-GTP protein can be quantitatively monitored using a specific anti-FLAG antibody and a HRP conjugated secondary antibody in a manner similar to that of a conventional ELISA assay (Fig. 1) .",

Overall, HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells had higher basal Rap1-GTP activates than their hEPAC1 counterparts, and the basal activities varied within a range of 3-fold among different stable clones. Stable clones with lowest basal activity for HEK293/hEPAC1/ Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 were selected, expanded and used for subsequent studies. After",

To optimize the assay, individual stable clones of HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 were first established and tested for their basal Rap1-GTP activates. Overall, HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 cells had higher basal Rap1-GTP activates than their hEPAC1 counterparts, and the basal activities varied within a range of 3-fold among different stable clones. Stable clones with lowest basal activity for HEK293/hEPAC1/ Flag-Rap1 or HEK293/mEPAC2/ Flag-Rap1 were selected, expanded and used for subsequent studies. After minimizing the basal Rap1-GTP activates, the levels of total lysate proteins that were optimal to be used for the assay were further determined by testing the signal response as a function of total lysate proteins applied in the assay. As shown in Fig. 2 , above background signal could be detected with as little as 0.8 \u00b5g total proteins from HEK293/hEPAC1/Flag-Rap1 cell lysate stimulated by1 \u00b5M of 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-AM (007-AM), a membrane permeable EPAC-specific agonist 30 .

The development of a cell-based assay for the discovery of EPAC-specific modulators has become an important area of research. Conventionally, EPAC cellular activity is assayed by monitoring relative cellular Rap-GTP levels using affinity pull-down with purified recombinant GST-RalGDS-RBD, which preferentially binds Rap-GTP over Rap-GDP with approximate 4,000-fold selectivity 32 . The levels of Rap-GTP from the affinity pull-down are further evaluated using immunoblotting analysis. This approach is laborious, time-consuming, costly, and involves a multi-step procedure prone to operational errors. Furthermore, Western blot analysis is difficult to quantify and not suitable for medium to high throughput experiments. To overcome these obstacles, a cell-based EPAC assay that enables the detection and quantification of EPAC-mediated cellular Rap1 activation under the microplate format has been designed, developed and optimized. In this assay, the immobilization of the purified His 6 -tagged RalGDS-RBD in the nickel-coated well of a 96-well plate allows convenient capture of active Rap1-GTP from the cell lysate, which can be easily monitored and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent detection using a microplate reader.",

This new assay has several clear advantages over other existing cell-based EPAC assays. Compared to the traditional bead-based Rap-GTP pull-down assay, the immobilized RalGDS-RBD bait in microplate enables assay miniaturization and automation. In fact, the assay can be performed in parallel for a large number of samples, each with as little as a few micrograms of total lysates. Moreover, if offers more reproducible and consistent capture of the Rap-GTP protein in the lysate and allows more convenient and reliable signal detection and quantification. By adapting a microplate format, our assay eliminates the need of centrifugation washing steps and immune-blotting based detection. Hence, the entire assay can be performed within hours, instead of days. Another alternative cellular EPAC assay utilizes EPAC-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) sensors. These genetically engineered sensors can be ectopically expressed in various cells for the detection of generation of intracellular cAMP in live cells in a spatial and temporal manner [36] [37] [38] . While cells stably expressing these biosensors can be adapted for microplate format assays, the signal-to-noise and dynamic range of these biosensors are normally poor and not adequate for HTS. Importantly, positive FRET or BRET signals driven by conformational changes of EPAC proteins do not always correlate with EPAC activation or inhibition, and conversely allosteric modulators of EPAC may not necessarily induce conformational changes that affect FRET/BRET-based readout. These drawbacks limit the general applicability of using EPAC-based biosensors for functional cell-based EPAC assays.",

            "text": "During the development of the assay, it became apparent that ectopic expression of EPAC and Rap1 raised the basal level of active Rap1, which decreased signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of the assay. In particular, HEK293/mEPAC2/Flag-Rap1 cells had higher baselines of active Rap1-GTP as compared those of HEK293/ hEPAC/Flag-Rap1 cells. This is most likely due to the fact that EPAC2 protein has a more than three-fold higher affinity for cAMP than EPAC1 protein. Through careful selection of cell clones with low levels EPAC and Rap1 expression, suitable signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range could be achieved. Ultimately, the use of an inducible expression system or genomic knock-in may provide a better solution of solving the aforementioned high basal activity problem. Another alternative is to use the endogenously expressed Rap1 protein as the readout, however, the absence of highly specific and sensitive Rap1 antibodies prevents its execution as currently available anti-Rap1 antibodies lack appropriate specificity and sensitivity for monitoring endogenous Rap1 activation using the microplate format.",

In theory, depending upon their cellular expression, these Rap modulators may interfere with the assay. However, considering that the design of the assay involves ectopic expression of EPAC proteins and their selective activation using cAMP stimulating agents, the possibility of interference by these non-EPAC Rap modulators should be minimal and negligible.",

GST-RalGDS-RBD-His 6 proteins were expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) and isolated using the Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin with a standard GST-fusion protein purification protocol in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Thrombin-cleaved RalGDS-RBD-His 6 proteins were further purified using a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/600 size exclusion column, which was connected to a Bio-Rad NGC chromatography system. Cell lines. HEK293 (ATCC) cells were grown in MEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . HEK293 stable cell lines expressing Flag-tagged human Rap1A (Flag-hRap1A) alone and co-expressing human EPAC1 (hEPAC1) and Flag-hRap1A or mouse EPAC2 (mEPAC2) and Flag-hRap1A were established by sequential transfections using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with mammalian expression vectors, first with pIRES2-EGFP containing Flag-hRap1A and followed by pIRES-hyg2 containing hEPAC1 or mEPAC2. Individual stable cell clones were selected and maintained in MEM containing 500 \u00b5g/ml G418 for pIRES2-EGFP and 100 \u00b5g/ml hygromycin B for pIRES-hyg2, respectively. Cellular Rap1 assay. HEK293 cells co-expressing hEPAC1/Flag-tagged hRap1A or mEPAC2/Flag-tagged hRap1A were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning #3513) at an initial confluency of 400,000 cell/well and incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 , in MEM medium with 10% FBS, for 24 hours. Cells were then rinsed with HBSS and cultured in FBS-free MEM medium for another 16 hours. If necessary cells were first pretreated with various concentration of antagonists or vehicle at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Otherwise, the cells were stimulated with various concentrations of agonists or vehicle controls at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min, then immediately rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 \u00b5l ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1% IGEPAL CA-630 and proteinase inhibitors cocktail. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 RCF for 20 min and their protein concentrations were determined by DC protein assay kit. 100 \u00b5l of properly diluted cell lysates containing 0 to 50 \u00b5g total proteins were added to nickel coated 96-well plate strips that were pre-coated with 200 \u00b5g of RalGDS-RBD-His 6 proteins and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 2 hours with gentle rocking. After washing with 100 \u00b5l ice-cold ELISA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% Tween-20) for 3 times, 100 \u00b5l mouse anti-Flag antibody (1:5000 in ELISA buffer) was added into each well and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hour with gentle shaking. Following three washes with 100 \u00b5l ice-cold ELISA buffer, 100 \u00b5l anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:3000 in ELISA buffer) were added into each well. After incubation at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking, the wells were washed three times with 100 \u00b5l ELISA buffer. 200 \u00b5l of OPD substrate was added into each well and absorbance signal at 450 nm was monitored using an M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) for 30 min with 1-min intervals. 10-min data points were used for quantification.
