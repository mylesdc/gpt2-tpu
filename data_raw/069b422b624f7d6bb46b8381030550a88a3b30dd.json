            "text": "Multiple viruses with zoonotic potential have been isolated from bats globally. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel paramyxovirus, Alston virus (AlsPV), isolated from urine collected from an Australian pteropid bat colony in Alstonville, New South Wales. Characterization of AlsPV by whole-genome sequencing and analyzing antigenic relatedness revealed it is a rubulavirus that is closely related to parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Intranasal exposure of mice to AlsPV resulted in no clinical signs of disease, although viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure. Oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding in respiratory secretions, and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain. These results imply that AlsPV may be similar to PIV5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species. This isolation of a novel paramyxovirus with the potential to transmit from bats to other mammalian species reinforces the importance of continued surveillance of bats as a source of emerging viruses.",

In fact, evidence suggests that bats host a greater proportion of zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian order [5] , highlighting the importance of identifying novel viruses in bats. Australian pteropid bats are becoming more urbanized and fewer bats are migrating, resulting in a greater chance of contact between bats and humans or domestic animals [6, 7] . This increased potential for exposure of non-reservoir hosts to bat-borne viruses leads to the increased probability of infection spillovers occurring [8, 9] .",

AlsPV was found to have this additional open reading frame with the capacity to express an SH protein of 44 aa in length. Despite lower similarity with PIV5 in this gene compared to the rest of the coding regions, the SH protein of AlsPV is predicted to have the same cell surface orientation as the SH protein of PIV5 [36] . The AlsPV SH protein is predicted to be a class II integral membrane protein with 16-19 cytoplasmic N-terminal residues and 1-5 C-terminal residues. It is therefore possible that the SH protein of AlsPV has the same anti-apoptotic functions as the SH proteins of PIV5 and MuV.",

Virus was reisolated from 9/12 nasal turbinate samples, 4/12 tonsil samples and from 2/12 olfactory bulb samples, suggesting that live virus was present in these tissues. Low titers of viral RNA could sometimes be detected in the retropharyngeal lymph node, the main draining lymph node of the upper respiratory tract, as well as the trachea and lung. Occasionally, viral RNA could be detected in other organs at low titers.",

Experimental intranasal infection of ferrets with PIV5, similar to the infection studies described here, demonstrated variable results ranging from no clinical symptoms to mild cough with minimal lesions in the nasal cavities and upper trachea [40, 41] . Antigen could only be detected in the trachea with no evidence of virus in the lungs or the brain [40, 41] , although it is not known if the olfactory bulb was specifically investigated. Neurological symptoms have been observed in ferrets experimentally infected with PIV5, but only after intracerebral injection as the route of infection. In addition to these in vivo similarities, PIV5 and AlsPV are similar in that they utilize sialic acid as a receptor for cell entry (49), grow to high titers in multiple mammalian cell lines with minimal cytopathic effect (229, 230) and encode an SH gene (49). The multiple similarities between the two viruses indicate that, despite the lack of clinical disease in ferrets and mice, AlsPV may also have the potential to infect other mammalian species.",

It is likely that from the nasal turbinates, the virus has access to the olfactory neurons that extend from the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate and into the olfactory neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity [42] , but further histopathological examination would be required to confirm this hypothesis. This allows direct access for the virus to disseminate through the central nervous system. However, AlsPV was not detected in brain tissue beyond the olfactory bulb. It is likely that the innate immune response had a role in preventing the spread of AlsPV throughout the CNS [42, 43] . Further investigation into the persistence of AlsPV is required, particularly as reduced cytopathic effect was observed during infection of some mammalian cell lines with AlsPV and viral RNA was detected in the olfactory pole of mouse brains at 21 days post infection.",

The presence of virus in oronasal shedding samples and in the upper respiratory tract suggests that AlsPV replicates in tissues that are relevant to virus transmission, although transmission studies are required to confirm if transmission occurs in ferrets. Further experiments are also required to determine the effect of the route of virus challenge and if oronasal infection with lower doses of AlsPV still results in subsequent infection of the olfactory nerve.",
