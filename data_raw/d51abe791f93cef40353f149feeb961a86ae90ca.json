Control of the disease with live attenuated vaccines administered via eye drop build upon immune responses generated by the eye-associated lymphoid tissues. The aim of this study was to assess cytokine and lymphocyte changes in the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT) and Harderian gland (HG) stimulated by the ocular inoculation of the ILTV chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine strain and virulent strain 63140. This study offers strong evidence to support the roles that the CALT and HG play in the development of protective ILTV immune responses. It supports the premise that ILTV-mediated immunomodulation favors the B cell response over those of T cells. Further, it provides evidence that expansions of CD8\u03b1 + cells, with the concomitant expression of the Granzyme A gene, are key to reducing viral genomes in the CALT and halting ILTV cytolytic replication in the conjunctiva. Ultimately, this study revealed that the early upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12p40 and Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 cytokine genes, which shape the antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses, retarded the decline of virus replication, and enhanced the development of lesions in the conjunctiva epithelium.",

Intervention strategies to control the disease rely on the implementation of biosecurity measures and vaccination with live-attenuated and/or recombinant viral vector vaccines expressing ILTV proteins [1]. Among live-attenuated vaccines, there are two main types: the tissue culture origin (TCO) vaccine [2] and chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines [3] . Both, CEO and TCO vaccines can be administered through the ocular, oral or intranasal mucosal routes to elicit local and systemic immunity [4, 5] , are capable of protecting chickens against clinical signs and mortality, and suppress replication of the challenge virus [6] . However, it has been demonstrated that live attenuated vaccine strains, most commonly the CEO vaccine strains, can revert to virulence if allowed to circulate in na\u00efve chickens and give rise to outbreak viruses, such as the virulent strain 63140 [1]. Although live attenuated vaccines are routinely used in the field, there is little definitive knowledge about the molecular and cellular immune response associated with ocular vaccine-induced protection.",

More recent studies suggest that the local inflammatory processes contribute to the pathology of the disease, and eventually modulate the responses of the adaptive immune system to facilitate viral replication [10] . Furthermore, ILTV infection appears to down-regulate type I interferon transcription and delays the early transcription of inflammatory genes to favor initial virus replication in the trachea [11, 12] .",

Lymph nodes in mammals are the principal sites for initial antigen presentation in mounting naive responses. In contrast, chickens have a distributed immune network featuring clusters of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) that appear to fill the role of organizing na\u00efve responses [13] . The head-associated lymphoid tissue (HALT) is comprised of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), the eye-associated lymphoid tissues organized in the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) and the Harderian gland (HG). Despite the absence of a direct anatomic connection to the respiratory system, the HG, CALT, and NALT serve as major contributors of immunity for the upper respiratory airways. For example, in the NALT, cells capable of taking up Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-coated beads following intranasal administration were identified as potential antigen presenting cells (APCs) [14] . In the HG, the number of IgA-and IgY-producing cells increased after the ocular inoculation of an adenovirus 5 vector expressing the avian influenza H5 protein [15] , and T effector cells (CD3 + , CD44 + ) were detected in the HG and the CALT after infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ocular inoculation [16] .",

Recent findings indicate that the mucosal route of viral entry-ocular, oral, or nasal-can greatly influence the levels of ILTV lytic replication and lymphocyte infiltration in the trachea and conjunctiva [17] . Therefore, assessing the changes in immune cell populations within the eye-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT and HG) after ILTV exposure may help identify important features occurring in mucosal tissues that are involved in ILTV pathogenesis and host immune responses. To this end, the objective of the present study was to assess differences in immune cell dynamics by monitoring the number of T and B lymphocytes, the number of MHC class I and MHC class II antigen surface expressing cells, and transcript profile of interleukin (IL)-12p40, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and Granzyme A genes in CALT and HG after ocular inoculation with the CEO vaccine strain or the virulent strain 63140. Collectively, this study highlights the important role of the eye-associated lymphoid tissue and the immunity elicited against ILTV infection. It provides evidence that the CALT and HG play different roles in the development of ILTV immune responses which were greatly influenced by the viral strain virulence.",

The virulent strain 63140 was propagated in chicken kidney cells obtained from 3 to 4-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens [19] . The CEO vaccine strain was reconstituted as recommended by the manufacturers. Both viral strains were titrated in chicken kidney cells prepared from 3-to 4-wk-old SPF chickens. Kidney cells were disassociated in a 0.25% trypsin solution (Corning, Cellgro) at 37 \u2022 C. After trypsinization, cell pellets were resuspended in incomplete media (1x Ham's media (Corning, Cellgro), 1\u00d7 M 199 (Gibco), 2% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.62% 1M Hepes buffer, 1.2% Sodium bicarbonate (Sigma)). Chicken kidney (CK) cells density was adjusted to 8 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL in incomplete media with the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) and 2% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). Fifty microliters of CK cells was seeded in 96-well plates. Twenty-four hours post-seeding, the complete medium was replaced with incomplete media, and plates were used 48 h after seeding. Five replicates of virus dilutions ranging from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22129 were inoculated per well with 50 microliters of each virus dilution. Plates were incubated at 39 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 for 5 days. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was determined by the presence of virus-induced cytopathic effect and estimated by the Reed and Muench method [20] .",

One-day-old chicks were housed in isolation units, with filtered air and negative pressure, and provided with feed and water ad libitum. At five weeks-of-age, chickens were arbitrarily divided in three groups. One group of chickens was inoculated with virulent strain 63140 (n = 75); a second group was inoculated with the CEO vaccine strain (n = 75). Both virus strains were administered via the ocular route. Viruses were diluted in incomplete media and a total dose of 10 3.5 TCID 50 was administered per chicken in a 60 \u00b5L volume, 30 \u00b5L per eye. The third group of chickens (n = 65) was mock inoculated with cell culture media in a similar fashion and used as negative control. At 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days post-inoculation (dpi), conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) of the lower eyelids, Harderian gland (HG) from both eyes, and upper trachea sections were collected from five chickens from each of the three treatment groups. CALT and HG samples were used for flow cytometry analysis, while the upper trachea sections were used to determine viral genome load by real-time PCR. Additionally, CALT and HG samples were collected from 4 to 6 chickens per group at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi and utilized to assess viral genome load and host cytokines genes transcription levels. At 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi conjunctiva samples were collected from five chickens from each group for histopathology examination. Clinical signs were obtained from days 2 to 7 post-inoculation (pi) from 6 to 7 randomly selected chickens per group. Signs of respiratory distress, lethargy and conjunctivitis were scored as previously described [6] . Briefly, signs of dyspnea, conjunctivitis and lethargy were scored on a scale of 0 to 3-normal (0), mild (0.5 to 1), moderate (1.5 to 2), and severe (2.5 to 3)-for each of the 3 clinical categories (Total maximum score = 9). Each chicken received a total clinical sign score, which was the sum of individual clinical signs categories. A total mean clinical signs score was calculated per group at each time point post-infection. ",

Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were calculated to determine the strength of the association between: MHCI + /MHCII Hi+ and IgM + cell percentages, IL-12p40 and IFN-\u03b3 genes transcription, and Granzyme A gene expression and the number of viral genomes. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using the Prism 7 (GraphPad, Software Inc. San Diego, CA, USA).",

The peak of clinical signs occurred at 5 dpi with mean total clinical signs score of 4.66 and 1.7 for the 63140 and CEO-inoculated groups, respectively ( Figure 2a ). genome load of 3.85 log10 was obtained.

Although the antigen specificity of the IgA + B cells was not determined, it should be noted that the increase in IgA + B cells occurred at the peak of (3 dpi) and following the decline (9 dpi) in virus replication in the conjunctiva epithelium. In earlier studies, it was determined that the peak of IgA + -producing cells in the trachea occurred at day 7 pi. This was after ILTV replication was no longer detected [27] . Also, it has been demonstrated that the immunomodulating effect of the viral chemokine binding protein, glycoprotein G, favors the recruitment of B cells over T cells to the trachea. This results in an enhanced humoral response, as indicated by an increase in circulating antibodies against ILTV [28] . Consequently, this immune modulation intensifies the level of the cytopathological lesions in the trachea epithelium [10] . The current study supports the premise that the immunomodulating effect exerted by the viral glycoprotein G favors ILTV persistence. Prolonged persistence of viral replication, and its associated damage to the conjunctiva epithelium that was observed following ocular exposure to virus. This was most clearly seen with the virulent strain, 63140. In the HG, the increase in the number of IgM + and MHCI + /MHCII Hi+ cells also supported the activation of B cells. However, a concurrent decline in viral genome load in the HG corresponded with the decline in the number of IgA + B cells in both groups of inoculated birds. This suggests that local IgA antibody response may not contribute significantly to the declined in virus replication. As the function of IgA is primarily to block the entry of the virus into cells at body surfaces, this was not completely unexpected. However, it has been reported that IgA + B cells produced in the HG migrate to other tissue sites to influence the humoral immune response on other mucosal tissues [29] .",

This decline was more severe for the 63140-inoculated birds than for the CEO-inoculated birds. In a previous study, after ocular inoculation with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a CD3 + /CD44 + cells population, a phenotype characteristic of activated T cells in birds, declined in the CALT at 3 dpi, but reached its peak expansion by 11 dpi. The authors indicated that following IBV exposure effector T cells initially left the CALT, then during the immune expansion phase, the CD3 + /CD44 + cells repopulated the CALT [16] . The CD4 + T cells population in the CALT of the 63140-inoculated birds expanded by day 7 pi. This coincided with the decline in viral genome load. However, viral lytic replication persisted in the conjunctiva epithelium during this time period. For the CEO-inoculated birds, the clearance of viral lytic replication from the conjunctiva epithelium occurred independent of a CD4 + cells expansion in the CALT. Taken together, these results suggest that CD4 + cells did not play a key role in the early clearance of the virus from the conjunctiva. In the HG, although no correlation between the number of CD4 + cells and decrease in viral genome load was revealed, the peak expansion of CD4 + cells (at 5 dpi) coincided with the decline in the genome viral load for each of the strains.",

It is not currently known if chicken antigen presenting cells (APCs) produce IL-12p40. However, it has been confirmed that following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or unmethylated CpG DNA, chicken macrophages from peripheral blood, or bone marrow [32] , and chicken thrombocytes [25] appear to express a functional analog of the IL-12p40 gene.",

This balance is necessary to avoid the damage associated with excessive inflammatory activation. The injection of IFN-\u03b3 into mice prior to ocular inoculation with Herpesvirus simplex 1 (HSV-1) significantly increased virus replication in the eye, increased the number of latently infected trigeminal ganglia, and produced more severe lesions in the cornea [36] . Under this model, it was determined that macrophage polarization, provoked by IFN-\u03b3, enhanced the production of inflammatory cytokines, and consequently exacerbated the disease. The macrophages in CALT and HG were not included in this analysis. Yet, the observed early increase in IL-12p40 and IFN-\u03b3 genes expression induced by the 63140 strain in the CALT was followed by an increase in inflammatory infiltrates in the conjunctiva. These observations warrant an investigation of whether the virulent strain 63140, but not the CEO vaccine strain, favors the pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages in the associated ocular tissues.",

The study demonstrated that after ocular inoculation the severity and duration of the lesions in the conjunctiva epithelium induced by the CEO vaccine strain were limited and resolved faster than those induced by the 63140 virulent strain. The CALT actively responded to both viral strains. Each strain induced the generation of IgA + cells and an increase in the number of IgM + and MHCI + /MHCII Hi+ cells. This suggested that the B cells activation in the tissues examined was part of the adaptive immune response to ILTV. However, the immunomodulating factor in ILTV appears to promote this B cell activation bias. An increase in the transcription of Granzyme A and its association with the decline in the number of viral genomes in the tissue appears to suggest that cytotoxic T cell and NK cell activation, rather than activated B cells, was primarily responsible for the clearance of the virus infection from the conjunctiva. Virus clearance from the HG appeared to be mediated by a broader set of immune responses. These include the generation of IgA + cells, the expansion of CD4 + cells, and the production of Granzyme A by resident CD8\u03b1 + cells. Rapidly after infection (1 dpi), the 63140 strain stimulated an upregulation of the IL-12p40 and IFN-\u03b3 genes in the CALT, but the CEO vaccine strain downregulated the expression of both of these genes. Therefore, a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which sustains the antigen-specific cell-mediated response, did not accelerate the clearance of the virus from the conjunctiva. This outcome underscores the effect that interactions between innate cells and ILTV have on the robustness and speed of adaptive immune responses.",
