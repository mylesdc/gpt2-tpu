It induces reproductive disorders, such as abortion, in pregnant sows, as well as severe respiratory tract disease in young pigs 6, 7 . PRRSV replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and leads to persistent infection, interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression. Growing evidence has indicated that miR-NAs play important roles in regulating viral infections 3, 4 . However, there are few studies that have focused on the interaction between PRRSV and miRNAs. Wang et al. 8 reported that miR-125b reduced PRRSV replication by negatively regulating the NF-\u03ba B pathway, and miR-24-3p promoted PRRSV replication through suppression of heme oxygenase-1 expression 9 . On the other hand, miR-181 inhibited PRRSV replication by targeting both viral genomic RNA and receptor CD163 10, 11 .",

Together, the miRNomes of mock-and PRRSV-infected piglet lungs enabled identification of downregulated miRNAs in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 and PAM cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , the abundant miRNAs in PRRSV-infected cells were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. ssc-miR-30d_R-1 expression was the most consistently and markedly decreased in both PAM cells (Fig. 1A) and MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1B) compared to matched mock controls and UV-PRRSV. However, the changes in other miRNAs-ssc-miR-27b, ssc-miR-145_R-1, ssc-miR-23a_R + 1 and ssc-miR-199a-5p-in PRRSV infection were found to be relatively small in infected PAM (Fig. 1A) and MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1B) .",

Four-week-old female SPF piglets were intravenously administered the synthetic ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic (0.1 nmol per day) one day before being inoculated with 10 5 in piglets from the miRNA mimic-infected group (Fig. 6A) . The body weight gain in piglets from the control mimic-infected group was reduced compared with the mock-and miRNA mimic-infected groups (Fig. 6B) . The lung wet:dry weight ratio of the control mimic-infected piglets was higher than that of the miRNA-infected pigs, with a significant difference at 168 h post infection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6C) . The histopathological changes in lungs of the infected piglets were observed at 72, 120 and 168 h following inoculation. As shown in Fig. 6 , infiltration by predominantly inflammatory cells and interstitial pneumonia with severe hyperemia were observed in the lungs of the control mimic-infected pigs at 72, 120 and 168 h post infection (Fig. 6D1-D3) . However, in the miRNA mimic-infected group, no obvious hyperemia in the lungs was observed at 72 h post infection (Fig. 6E1) , and light hyperemia at 120 and 168 h post infection was observed (Fig. 6E2,E3) . No obvious histopathological changes were observed in non-infected group (Fig. 6F1-F3 ). In addition, PRRSV was detected in the sera of control mimic-infected pigs from 3 to 14 days post infection but was observed in miRNA mimic-infected pigs from 5 to 10 days post infection by RT-PCR (data not shown). The viral titers in the lungs of control mimic-and miRNA-infected pigs were calculated to be 10 \u22122.25 TCID 50 /ml and 10 \u22120.625 TCID 50 /ml at 168 h post infection, respectively (data not shown). Taken together, the results indicate that the ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic has a significant inhibitory effect on viral replication in PRRSV-inoculated SPF piglets.",

For example, influenza viruses replicated to higher titers in cells with pre-activated NF-\u03ba B, and conversely, progeny virus production was reduced when NF-\u03ba B signaling was impaired 28, 29 . Williams et al. reported that sustained induction of NF-\u03ba B is required for efficient expression of latent HIV type 1 30 .

Previous studies also showed that PRRSV infection triggered NF-\u03ba B activation 31 , and the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV could activate NF-\u03ba B when ectopically expressed in MARC-145 cells 32 . However, the activated NF-\u03ba B could only be detected after 24 h post infection. In contrast, the ectopic expression of several individual PRRSV nsp proteins, such as nsp1a, nsp1b, nsp2, and nsp11, were reported to negatively regulate NF-\u03ba B activation. For example, Sun et al. reported that PRRSV nsp2 inhibited the NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway by interfering with the polyubiquitination process of IkBa 33 . Furthermore, PRRSV nsp1a could inhibit NF-\u03ba B activation and suppress IFN-\u03b2 production 12, 31, 34 .",

The elaborate mechanisms by which PRRSV regulates NF-\u03ba B activation and how the latter promotes PRRSV replication require further study. We showed that ssc-miR-30d_R-1 was decreased following infection in MARC-145 and PAM cells in the present study. We compared the basal expression levels of ssc-miR-30d_R-1, ssc-miR-27b, ssc-miR-145_R-1, ssc-miR-23a_R + 1, and ssc-miR-199a-5p in PAMs by qPCR and found that ssc-miR-30d_R-1 was among the most highly expressed miRNAs examined (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that PRRSV infection downregulated the expression of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 as the infection progressed. Significant downregulation was first observed at 12 h, and further reductions in ssc-miR-30d_R-1 levels were observed at later time points. It is plausible to speculate that PRRSV infection gradually decreases ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mRNA expression, which in turn, relieves the stabilizing effect on TLR4 mRNA, ultimately leading to subsequent NF-\u03ba B activation. In our study, ssc-miR-30d_R-1 can significantly inhibit the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 ) in a time-dependent manner in MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, we explored the effects of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 on PRRSV infection in SPF piglets by evaluating body temperature, body weight, viral titer, and pathological changes, among others. Although there was no significant difference in lung pathological changes between the Figure 6 . ssc-miR-30d_R-1 suppressed the pathogenic effect of PRRSV in SPF piglets. The piglets were treated with PBS, control mimic and synthetic ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic before being inoculated with PRRSV. The body temperature (A) and body weight (B) were measured at every time point. At 72, 120 or 168 h post inoculation, the piglets were sacrificed, and lung tissue was obtained to calculate the lung wet:dry weight ratio (C) and measure the pathological changes in the lungs (D-F, inflammatory cells infiltration: solid and thick arrows and hyperemia: solid and thin arrows). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. All values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. P values were determined using a Student's t test by comparing to the virus only group. miRNA mimic-infected group and control mimic-infected group after 168 h post infection, these results showed that treatment with ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimics can significantly reduce the damage to infected piglets at an early stage. In addition, a previous study showed that the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascade may be involved in PRRSV-induced NF-\u03ba B activation 35 .",

Briefly, lung tissues were sampled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground into fine powder using a mortar and pestle, weighted for one milligram and homogenized in 1 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline. Clarified homogenates were titrated for viral infectivity in MARC-145 cells cultured in 96-well plates from initial dilutions of 1:10. Viral titers were expressed as the mean TCID 50 /mL. The remaining piglets (n = 3) were monitored for 14 days for virus detection in serum.",
