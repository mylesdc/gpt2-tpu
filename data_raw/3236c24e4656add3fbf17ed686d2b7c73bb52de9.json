Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a labbased qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay. The availability of a rapid NAAT, such as the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay, at the point of care (POC) or in laboratories that do not have access to large platform NAAT could increase the percentage of individuals who receive an acute HIV infection status or confirmation of their HIV status, while immediately linking them to counseling and medical care. In addition, early knowledge of HIV status could lead to reduced high-risk behavior at a time when individuals are at a higher risk for transmitting the virus.",

Because individuals are at higher risk for transmitting the virus during early or acute infection, accurate and timely diagnosis may reduce the transmission of HIV when the individual is most infectious [1] . Early detection of HIV has been shown to lead to reduced high-risk behavior and to connect individuals to treatment earlier, which can reduce the risk of virus transmission [2, 3] . In 2006, an MMWR was published that advocated routine, voluntary testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women aged 13-64 years in health-care settings as normal practice [2] . Although there are currently a large number of FDA-approved HIV diagnostic tests with high sensitivities and specificities available, there were still 1.1 million people in the U.S. living with HIV at the end of 2011, of which, 15.8% remained undiagnosed or were unaware of their infection status [4] . Point-of-care (POC) testing has increased the number of individuals who are screened for HIV and receive their HIV test results [5] . In the U.S., examples of POC settings may include, but are not limited to, clinics, mobile testing units, jails, and emergency rooms.",

In this algorithm, specimens are screened with a sensitive HIV-1/2 immunoassay, preferably a fourth-generation antigen/antibody assay, followed by an HIV-1/2 differentiation assay. Specimens that are nonreactive are considered negative. Specimens that have concordant reactivity on the screening and supplemental test are considered positive for HIV-1/2 antibodies; however, in the case of discordant immunoassay results, HIV-1 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is recommended. NAAT is highly sensitive, virus specific, and allows for detection of infection approximately two weeks earlier than most antibody-based tests [5, 6] .",

            "text": "To date, there are no definitive guidelines for HIV testing at the POC. Rapid tests have facilitated HIV testing at the POC because they can be completed in a short period of time (typically less than 30 minutes) and require minimal technical expertise. Currently, there are a number of rapid antibody tests available that are FDA-approved; however, they are not as sensitive for detection of early HIV infection as most laboratory based assays and will remain negative during the period post-infection, but pre-seroconversion [7] . The availability of a rapid NAAT for use at the POC could increase the ability to detect acute infection. The Aptima HIV-1 Assay (Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA) is currently the only FDA-approved diagnostic NAAT, but its use is not feasible for the POC due to the high cost per test, dedicated equipment requirements, and the need for trained technical staff. Ideally, a rapid NAAT should be completed in a short time frame with a few simple steps, be easy to interpret, and require no or minimal equipment. In addition, the rapid NAAT must exhibit a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal amplification techniques are attractive for the development of a rapid NAAT because they do not require thermal cycling and, therefore, the reaction can be run in a simple heat block, water bath, or other portable heating device [8] . One such isothermal technique, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), has been developed for the detection of DNA [9] and RNA (reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification or RT-LAMP) [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

The amplification method is highly specific because it requires six primers that recognize eight different sequences in the same target region. The method is less sensitive to biological inhibitors than PCR, which allows for amplification directly from biological samples, such as whole blood, plasma and oral fluid, without the need for extraction of nucleic acid [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Amplified material can be detected within 15-60 minutes when incubated at a constant temperature (60-65\u00b0C) and immediate visual detection is possible due to the large amount of DNA generated from each reaction [19] . In addition, several groups have incorporated fluorescent detection methods into the LAMP assay for real-time or immediate naked-eye detection [17] [19] [20] [21] [22] . We have demonstrated previously the development of an HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay that incorporates a sequence-specific detection method and allows for the simultaneous detection of both RNA and DNA in a single reaction tube [17] .",

This eliminates the need to open the reaction tubes after amplification and reduces the risk of amplicons being released and contaminating the work environment. An additional HIV-1 primer set was designed in a highly conserved region of the INT gene, using PrimerExplorer V3 software available on the Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd. (Japan) website (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/). A region within the integrase gene was selected for primer design due to the high degree of sequence conservation within subtype B and across the group M subtypes, as summarized in the HIV Sequence Compendium (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The HIV-1 HXB2 sequence (GenBank accession number AF033819) was used as the reference for generating the primers. The sequences of the INT primers and quencher probe are listed in Table 1 .

For the SeraCare samples (n = 7), only one of the panels became reactive during the sample collection period by the rapid Ab test. This particular sample became rapid Ab reactive 14 days after the first detectable viral load and the first qualitative RNA positive (Table 2 ). In contrast, all of the SeraCare panels were reactive by the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay between 0 and 2 days (median = 0) after the first detectable viral load and qualitative RNA positive. For most panels, both the RT and INT primers detected samples from the same time point; however, in select cases, one primer set detected a sample prior to the other. Based on the viral load data from the panel, the RT primer set detected all of the SeraCare samples in the expected sensitivity range of the assay (> 10 4 RNA copies/ mL) and the INT primer set detected 6 out of 7 of the panels in the expected sensitivity range. In comparison to the laboratory-based tests, the RT-LAMP assay detected members in all seroconversion panels prior to the Ab EIA, and 0 to 7 days (median = 3.5) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. None of the seroconversion panel members became WB positive during the sample collection period. For the ZeptoMetrix panels (n = 5), the rapid Ab test detected panel members 7 to 29 days (median = 19) post first detectable viral load and the first qualitative RNA positive (Table 3 ). In contrast, the RT-LAMP assay detected panel members within 0 to 5 days (median = 5) post first detectable viral load and qualitative RNA positive, which was 7 to 24 days (median = 15) earlier than the rapid Ab test. Overall, similar reactivity was observed between the RT and the INT primers for RT-LAMP with this panel. In comparison to the laboratory-based tests, the RT-LAMP assay detected panel members anywhere from 2 to 14 days (median = 9) prior to the Ab EIA and 0 to 14 days (median = 2) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. The RT-LAMP assay was able to detect samples 9 to 29 days (median = 22) before the WB assay. Overall, the RT-LAMP assay detected all of the Zeptometrix panel members within our expected viral load sensitivity range (10 4 RNA copies/ mL). A summary of the HIV-1 test results for these panels, in relation to the first rapid Ab reactive test result is shown in Fig 2. The SeraCare panels were not included in the timeline because of the short follow-up time and the fact that only one subject became rapid Ab test reactive during the sample collection period.",

            "text": "The primary goal of this study was to demonstrate the utility of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay for detection of acute HIV-1 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of acute HIV infection detection using the RT-LAMP assay. In previous studies, we demonstrated the usefulness of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay for detection of both DNA and RNA in a single reaction [16, 17] . In the current study, the primary focus was RNA detection, since high plasma viral loads are characteristic of acute infection; however, proviral DNA may also be detected in whole blood. To enable immediate naked eye visualization of the amplified products, a sequence-specific fluorescent detection method was developed for the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay [17] . We further modified the detection method by adding the quencher probe directly into the reaction, which eliminated the need to open the reaction tubes post-amplification. A large amount of amplicons are produced during the LAMP process and reducing the risk of releasing these amplicons into the testing environment is crucial for non-laboratory settings. For POC use, it is advantageous to be able to assess sample positivity immediately post-amplification, without any additional steps. Further assay improvements included the design of a novel primer set that recognizes a conserved region within the HIV-1 integrase sequence. Although assay performance for the RT and INT primer sets was demonstrated separately for comparison purposes, the primer sets can be combined in a multiplex RT-LAMP reaction without altering the sensitivity of the reaction [16] . The APTIMA HIV-1 Qualitative Assay and the COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS Taq-Man HIV-1 Test V2.0 have both demonstrated that detection of clinical isolates may be facilitated by targeting two separate, conserved regions within the HIV genome because of the sequence diversity of HIV-1 [27, 28] . Furthermore, a multiplexed approach may be beneficial to circumvent potential mismatches due to resistance mutations induced by antiretroviral use. For POC use, the RT-LAMP assay may be performed using low-tech, portable heating devices, such as the ESEQuant Tube Scanner (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) [29] or non-instrumented nucleic acid (NINA) heaters [8] . Similar performance between these devices and traditional thermal cyclers has been demonstrated for the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay [8] . In the current study, however, a thermal cycler was used as a matter of convenience for large-scale testing.",

It should be noted, however, that the Multispot is not currently Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)waived for use at the POC. In seroconverting individuals, we demonstrated earlier detection (1-3 weeks) with the RT-LAMP assay as compared to the Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test. Since viral RNA is detectable in the plasma up to 4 weeks prior to antibody, depending on the specific test [30] , these results were not unexpected.

In the current study, the APTIMA detected infection up to five days earlier than the RT-LAMP assay. This is not surprising given the large discrepancy in input sample volume between the two assays. When taking into account the extraction process that occurred prior to adding sample to the reaction, the RT-LAMP assay used only 7% of the sample volume required for APTIMA. It has been demonstrated that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay can be increased by increasing the overall reaction volume [16] . In addition, HIV nucleic acids can be concentrated directly from the clinical specimen through membrane capture/ concentration methods [18, 45] .",
