            "text": "The sensitivity and accuracy of results obtained by QPCR are dependent on a reliable reference within each sample to normalise for sample to sample and run to run variation [2] . These variations arise from differences in nucleic acid integrity, the efficiency of the reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA and the amount of sample loaded. References for normalising sample and run variation include the use of total nucleic acid concentrations, rRNA concentrations or the simultaneously measurement of the expression of an individual or select group of genes termed 'housekeeping' genes, which has become by far the most commonly used method and is the most reliable [3] . Housekeeping genes are used under the assumption that their expression is unchanged in response to the experimental conditions being investigated. Therefore a major factor when using QPCR is the selection of appropriate control genes, as any variation in the expression of the reference gene between sample groups will reduce the sensitivity of the assay to detect changes in the expression of genes of interest and may also produce artificial changes [3] . Traditionally glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and \u03b2-actin (BACT) have been most commonly used, however many recent reports have shown that the expression of these genes can be variable under several experimental conditions, making them inappropriate for use as normalisers [4] [5] [6] [7] . In reality no cellular gene maintains constant expression levels under all conditions and the evaluation of an appropriate control gene to normalise QPCR data is therefore an essential requirement when designing QPCR experiments using new experimental conditions [8] . This is especially the case when investigating the effects of viruses on host cell gene expression as viruses can interfere with host cell pathways, the components of which traditional housekeeping genes often encode. These include cell cycle, metabolism, DNA replication and transcription, in order to aid their replication cycle [9] [10] [11] . Studies have been carried out to determine reliable housekeeping genes in cells infected with a variety of viruses [7, 12] , however to date no such study has been carried out in cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the herpes viruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Thus, in this study we have investigated the suitability of 10 commonly used housekeeping genes for use as QPCR normalisers in a variety of cell types infected with a variety of strains of HIV-1, HSV-1, VZV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) compared to mock infected cells.",

The expression levels of 10 commonly used QPCR normalisation genes in both and mock and virally infected cells was determined by QPCR.

Using the results from the GeNorm analysis it was possible to list the housekeeping genes in order of reliability in the context of each viral infection (Table 3) . 18sRNA was the least reliable reference gene as it had had the highest sum v value (13.26) which represents the standard deviation (SD) of reference gene expression over all viral infections investigated. Correspondingly it was either the least or second least reliable gene in 9 of the 10 experimental settings. Additionally BACT and HMBS also had high sum v values of 10.51 and 9.65 respectively, indicating that these genes are generally less reliable for use as normalisers for QPCR assays. According to this analysis the most reliable overall reference gene was PP1A with a sum v value of 7.41 and the most reliable gene in 7 of the 10 viral infections. Other genes with low sum v values were SDHA (8.91), GAPDH (8.74), TBP (9.06) and EEF1G (9.16), though in the context of HSV-1 NC1 infected HELA cells EEF1G was identified as the least reliable gene. In the case of CMV an almost identical pattern in reliability was observed in infected primary HFF cells regardless of differences in the virus strain used and a very similar pattern was also seen in VZV Schenke infected cells despite differences in the origin of the primary cell types used for infection. Though the expression pattern of reference genes in HELA and HEP2 cells infected with HSV-1 NC-1 were also similar, it is of note that in HEP2 cells GAPDH was the second most reliable gene whereas in HELA cells it was the third most unreliable. The expression pattern of reference genes in cells infected with HIV-1 was also similar though greater differences were detected compared to the other ",

Careful consideration must therefore be carried out when choosing appropriate reference genes in QPCR experiments and the reliability of a panel of potential genes should be determined for individual experimental conditions [3, 8] . Ideally the best two or three of these genes would then be used for normalisation purposes [16] . This is of particular concern to molecular virologists as most viruses modulate key cellular processes which may involve changing the expression of QPCR reference genes.

Nevertheless it is of benefit for researchers to be able to determine a shortlist of potential candidates. To date the variability of housekeeping gene expression has been studied in cells infected with SARS corona virus, yellow fever virus, human herpes virus-6, camelpox virus, CMV [7] and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [12] . However such a study has never been carried out using the key human pathogens HIV, HSV and VZV. Therefore in this study we have extended the published investigations by determining the suitability of 10 commonly used reference genes in the context of infection with various strains of HIV-1, HSV-1, CMV and VZV in a range of both primary and cultured cell lines using the GeNorm tool [13] .",

This correlates with the data from Radonic et al [7] who found BACT to be the most unreliable of 10 reference genes studied in a range of 5 viral infections. 18sRNA was not included in their study however. In contrast Bernasconi et al [12] found BACT had the lowest coefficient of variation of 451 housekeeping genes spotted on microarrays in EBV infection in B cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. It is of note however that the \u03b3-herpes virus EBV was not included in our study or of that of Radonic et al though the \u03b2-herpes virus CMV and \u03b1-herpes viruses HSV-1 and VZV were. In agreement with Radonic et al we found that PP1A was the most reliable reference gene across all infections. However in contrast to their finding that TBP was equally reliable as PP1A we found it to be the 4 th most reliable gene. Other reliable genes identified by our study included GAPDH and SDHA.",

However, we found that two of these (18sRNA and BACT) were the least reliable in the context of the viral infections that we investigated. In contrast to all other infections, 18sRNA was not an unreliable control gene when MDDCs were infected with HIV-1 BaL. In addition it is of note that although GAPDH was one of the most reliable reference genes identified overall, it was the third most unreliable gene in HELA cells infected with HSV-1 NC1 (whereas it was the second most reliable reference gene in HEP2 cells infected with the same strain of HSV-1). These findings therefore highlight the importance of re-evaluating the choice housekeeping genes when making even slight changes to experimental settings.",
