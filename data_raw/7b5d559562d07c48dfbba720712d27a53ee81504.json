            "text": "Recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli are frequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). By means of this technique, tagged proteins containing a polyhistidine sequence can be obtained up to 95% pure in a single step, but some host proteins also bind with great affinity to metal ions and contaminate the sample. A way to overcome this problem is to include a second tag that is recognized by a preexistent monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the gene encoding the target protein, allowing further purification. With this strategy, the recombinant protein can be directly used as target in capture ELISA using plates sensitized with the corresponding mAb. As a proof of concept, in this study we engineered a Trichinella-derived tag (MTFSVPIS, recognized by mAb US9) into a His-tagged recombinant Fasciola antigen (rFhLAP) to make a new chimeric recombinant protein (rUS9-FhLAP), and tested its specificity in capture and indirect ELISAs with sera from sheep and cattle. FhLAP was selected since it was previously reported to be immunogenic in ruminants and is expressed in soluble form in E. coli, which anticipates a higher contamination by host proteins than proteins expressed in inclusion bodies. Our results showed that a large number of sera from non-infected ruminants (mainly cattle) reacted in indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP after single-step purification by IMAC, but that this reactivity disappeared testing the same antigen in capture ELISA with mAb US9. These results demonstrate that the 6XHis and US9 tags can be combined when double purification of recombinant proteins is required.

            "text": "antigens were more specific than natural ones, but several studies have shown just the contrary [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although this phenomenon has not yet been investigated in detail, some reports pointed out that the presence of contaminants derived from the expression of His-tagged proteins in E. coli may explain the poor specificity of such antigens [5] . Optimized E. coli expression [6], acidic washes [7, 8] , and washing with low amounts of imidazole [9] are methods commonly used to prevent the co-purification of proteins on immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), thus improving the purity of His-tagged recombinant proteins. Also, disulfide bond formation between the protein of interest and other proteins, as well as nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, can be minimized by inclusion of 2-mercaptoethanol and non-ionic detergents, respectively, in the loading buffer [8] . However, since a relevant fraction of contaminant E. coli proteins exhibit moderate to strong affinity for metal-chelating resins [9], these methods do not guarantee complete purity of recombinant proteins and may decrease the yield of the purified protein.",

            "text": "Another way to overcome the above problems is grafting a second linear epitope tag recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) into the target sequence of interest, thus allowing repurification of the protein by affinity chromatography. Currently there are some proprietary tag-mAb pairs that can be used for affinity-purification and for detection of tagged recombinant proteins [10, 11] . However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them were used to develop sandwich ELISA methods for serodiagnosis of infectious diseases, a strategy that, if successful, would allow recapturing of the refolded antigen of interest in a single step. To explore this methodology, in the present study we grafted the linear sequence MTFSVPIS, located at the amino terminal region of the gp53 antigen from encapsulated species of Trichinella and recognized by the IgG1/\u03ba mAb US9 [12] [13] [14] , into a His-tagged Fasciola hepatica recombinant protein (leucine aminopeptidase; FhLAP). FhLAP is a cytoplasmic metalloproteinase isolated from adult flukes [15] , which was reported to be able to induce specific antibodies during infection as well as partial protection against reinfection in immunized sheep [16] [17] [18] . Although native [19] [20] [21] and recombinant [4, 22, 23] Fasciola cathepsins (clades L1, L2 and/or L5) are more adequate as target antigens in ELISA for immunodiagnosis of human and animal infections, for the proof of concept of the present study, we preferred FhLAP since it can be expressed soluble in transformed E. coli and, consequently, undesirable host proteins are more prone to be present. Moreover, since native FhLAP was previously tested as target antigen for immunodiagnosis of human fascioliasis, this study provides us with the opportunity to evaluate its usefulness to diagnose F. hepatica infections in domestic ruminants (sheep and cattle).",

Confirmation of the presence or absence of infection was done by determination of coproantigens in fecal samples using the MM3-COPRO ELISA [24, 25] . In addition, samples of feces from all animals were subjected to sedimentation [26] and flotation [27] procedures to concentrate the helminth eggs, which were then microscopically examined. Sera from non-infected cattle (n = 49) and naturally Fasciola-infected cattle (n = 36) were randomly selected from the collection of sera stored at INGACAL-CIAM. Serum samples from non-infected cattle were collected from animals belonging to Holstein Friesian and \"rubia galega\" strains reared in the Fasciola-free farm from the INGACAL-CIAM. As for noninfected sheep, fecal samples from these animals tested negative in MM3-COPRO ELISA. Serum samples from Fasciola-infected cattle were obtained from animals of the strains above, which were sacrificed at local abattoirs and further classified as infected due to the presence of flukes in livers (gold standard). Fecal samples from these animals also tested positive by MM3-COPRO ELISA. As for sheep samples, samples of feces from all animals were examined for the presence of eggs of F. hepatica and other parasites.",

Briefly, polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner BioOne 96 well 8 X F12 strips, high binding plates) were coated with purified mAb MM3 (100 \u03bcL/well at 5 \u03bcg/mL in PBS), incubated ON at 4\u02daC, washed three times with PBS and blocked with 200 \u03bcL/well of 1.5% sodium caseinate in PBS for 1 h at RT.

Finally, the optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm. The OD values for each sample were calculated as OD1-OD2, where OD1 is the value for the Ag+ well, and OD2 is the value for the Ag-well. Two cut-off values for sheep and cattle were considered to maximize specificity. Cut-off 1 was calculated as the sum of the maximal OD value obtained for negative sera from each species plus one SD [4] and cut-off 2 was determined by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis for 100% specificity.",

As inhibitor, the synthetic peptide MTFSVPIS (US9-recognizing epitope) was used.

Also, several minor bands of different MW (lane 3) can be observed, which probably correspond to truncated proteins and/or E. coli contaminants copurified during the IMAC procedure. The presence of rUS9-FhLAP truncates could be confirmed in WB revealing the proteins with mAb US9 (lane 4) and a mAb recognizing the poly-His tag (Fig 2A, lane 5) . Moreover, the excellent recognition of both the whole protein and rUS9-FhLAP truncates by mAb US9 indicated that the positioning of the US9 epitope between the poly-His tag and the FhLAP sequence is adequate for the objective of the study. In addition, we investigated if the rUS9-FhLAP is also correctly recognized in ELISA by a serum from a Fasciola-infected sheep. The data in Fig 2B and 2C showed that the sheep serum reacted with the recombinant antigen in a dose-dependent manner and that the ELISA signal reached a plateau at antigen concentrations over 10 \u03bcg/mL for US9-ELISA and over 3 \u03bcg/mL for indirect ELISA.",

Each serum was tested simultaneously in indirect ELISA using rUS9-FhLAP coupled to the wells of ELISA plates, and in two capture ELISAs, US9-ELISA and MM3-ELISA (reference method).

The same percentages were also obtained analyzing the sera by US9-ELISA, but the serum testing negative using the respective cut-off 1 in indirect ELISA and in US9-ELISA was not the same. Although most sheep sera were correctly classified using either indirect ELISA or capture US9-ELISA, if we consider the differences obtained between the OD values for each positive sera and the corresponding cut-off values, the best results were obtained, as expected, with MM3-ELISA, followed by US9-ELISA. In this sense, it should be noted that, for both cut-offs, these differences were greater than 0.9 for our reference method (MM3-ELISA), while only 4/ 18 (22.2%) of sera reached these values with the other two ELISA methods. These data strongly suggest that FhLAP is recognized during infection of sheep by F. hepatica but that this protease provokes a lesser antigenic stimulus than L-cathepsins, probably due to two facts: i) unlike FhLAP (cytoplasmatic), Fasciola L-cathepsins are the most abundant secreted proteins, thus being permanently in contact with host immune cells, and ii) during its biological cycle, Fasciola produces different L-cathepsins [35] that have high sequence identity and thus may reciprocally boost the production of antibodies. As for sheep, all sera from infected and non-infected cattle were correctly classified using the MM3-ELISA regardless of the two cut-off values investigated (Fig 4) . However, the data in Fig 4 also revealed that the antigens present in the rUS9-FhLAP preparation are strongly recognized by a large number of non-infected cattle sera in indirect ELISA. In this sense, we observed that 33/49 (67.3%) of sera from non-infected cattle produced OD values \ufffd0.2 (range OD = 0.069-0.963) after subtracting the corresponding non-specific binding value of the plate (OD = 0.06; without serum). As expected, the high reactivity of these sera limited the number of infected cattle sera testing positive in indirect ELISA, as only 10/36 (27.8%) and 13/36 (36.1%) samples were classified as positive using cut-off 1 and cut-off 2, respectively. Unlike in the indirect ELISA, capture of the rUS9-FhLAP antigen by mAb US9 drastically decreased the OD values obtained with non-infected cattle sera. As can be observed in Fig 4, as for the MM3-ELISA, the US9-ELISA provided OD values below 0.1 (range 0.0-0.084). However, the results in Fig 4 also demonstrated that, contrary to L-cathepsins, only part of the infected cattle produced specific antibodies to FhLAP. Specifically, 18/36 (50%) and 20/36 (55.5%) of infected cattle sera tested positive by US9-FhLAP ELISA using cut-off 1 and cut-off 2, respectively. Nevertheless, these results were better than those obtained by indirect ELISA (see above).",

To this end, the protein profiles of soluble M15 proteins, before and after IMAC-purification, were firstly revealed by SDS-PAGE and protein staining with BlueSafe ( Fig 7A) . Then, the eluted protein fraction was used as target antigen in indirect ELISA to investigate whether it is recognized by sera from non-infected cattle (Fig 7B) . The results in Fig 7 clearly showed that: i) a broad MW range (10-200 kDa) of soluble proteins from non-transformed M15 E. coli bond to the IMAC column (Fig 7A) , ii) these proteins are recognized in indirect ELISA by sera from non-infected cattle (mean OD = 0.17\u00b10.08SD; OD range: 0.07-0.47), and iii) the reactivity observed in indirect ELISA testing sera from non-infected cattle (n = 35) significantly correlated (R 2 = 0.42; p<0.0001) with that obtained using IMAC-purified rUS9-FhLAP (Fig 7B) . These data, together with the fact that the IMAC-purified M15 protein fraction was able to inhibit 50-70% of the reactivity of selected sera from non-infected cattle in an indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP (not showed), clearly indicates that native E. coli proteins bind and co-elute with recombinant proteins during IMAC purification, and thus constitute a relevant source of non-specific binding by natural antibodies present in sera from cattle. Moreover, since such reactivity was not observed when testing the same sera in WB (not showed), it seems that the target of cattle antibodies are mainly conformational epitopes.",

In addition, we investigated a possible correlation between OD values obtained with sera from non-infected cattle against rUS9-FhLAP and against E. coli O55:B5 LPS, both in indirect ELISA. As deals with the presence of lipid A, the anti-lipid A polyclonal antibodies produced low OD values in wells of ELISA plates coated with rUS9-FhLAP (OD = 0.12) and no signal in the wells coated with mAb US9 plus rUS9-FhLAP. Moreover, the results in Fig 8 showed (p = 0.62) between OD values obtained for non-infected cattle sera tested against rUS9-FhLAP and LPS, both in indirect ELISA.

Typically, epitope tags (commonly, 5-16 residues in length) are selected among linear sequences [10, 40] and have a negative GRAVY index (i.e., hydrophilic) assuming that hydrophilic tags are exposed at the surface and thus are more accessible to antibodies. Also, in most studies tags have been placed at the amino or carboxy terminal regions in the belief that the loss of function will be minimal, although this is not a general rule applicable to any protein (reviewed in [37] ).",

While the classical 6XHis is the most commonly used tag for single-step purification of recombinant proteins, allowing purities of up to 95% with 90% recovery of the tagged protein [8] , the remaining contaminants may be of great importance when these antigens are used as target in Dual tagging of a recombinant Fasciola antigen immunodiagnosis or in any other situation where a homogeneous product is required. The advantage of using a dual tag could be evidenced in our study, in which the rUS9-FhLAP purified in a single step by IMAC showed strong reactivity in indirect ELISA with many sera from non-infected ruminants (mainly from cattle), but disappeared when these antigens were repurified by mAb US9 in capture ELISA. Typical metal-binding contaminants during IMAC purifications include non-protein components (e.g., phospholipids, nucleic acids and LPS), but also host cell proteins like outer membrane proteins, stress-responsive proteins (folding machinery) and ribosomal subunit proteins [41] , some of which require more than 80 mM imidazole for elution [9] .",

Likewise, a great diversity of E. coli proteins with affinity for Ni(II) ions was also observed among soluble proteins obtained from non-transformed M15 cells (Fig 7A) using PBS plus 5mM imidazole as loading and washing buffer. It is also noticeable that false positive results using IMACpurified recombinant proteins is not limited to the rUS9-FhLAP antigen of present study, as similar observations were also reported using the more antigenic Fasciola recombinant cathepsins L as target in ELISA after expression in Pichia pastoris and further purification by IMAC [2] . Moreover, recent studies in our laboratory showed that the number of false positives was less relevant when the antigens (procathepsins L) were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, as these aggregates are first washed by centrifugation and most of contaminant host soluble proteins are eliminated prior to denaturation and IMAC affinity-purification [4] .",

Nevertheless, it should be underlined that its insertion into the rFhLAP sequence was performed in tandem after the 6XHis tag and that 5 additional residues were also incorporated into the amino terminal region due to the cloning procedure. Consequently, twenty extra residues were incorporated into the amino region of the rFhLAP sequence ( 1 MRGSHHHHHHGSMTFSVPIS 20 ) with a GRAVY = -0.735, which is in the range of many other epitope tags [10] . It is also noticeable that the US9 epitope in the chimeric rUS9-FhLAP has a similar position as in the parental mature sequence of gp53 from T. spiralis ( 1 STDNENVAMKEMTFSVPIS 19 , GRAVY = -0.289; gb|CAD86781.1) and T. britovi ( 1 STDNENAAMKEMTFSVPIS 19 , GRAVY = -0.416; gb|CAD86782.1) [13] , which anticipated the good recognition of rUS9-FhLAP by mAb US9. Moreover, the presence of GS dipeptides before the 6XHis and the US9 epitope probably also facilitates the recognition by mAb US9, as \"GS\" linkers are commonly used as flexible linkers to engineer recombinant fusion proteins [45, 46] and to link epitopes within chimeric multiepitope recombinant antigens [47, 48] . Finally, it should also be considered that, although the MTFSVPIS sequence belongs to a nematode protein, its recognition by sera from infected animals in capture ELISA is not possible since such epitope is not available after binding to the capture antibody (US9).",

This strategy may be advantageous over indirect ELISAs by at least two reasons: i) unlike in indirect ELISA, all antigen molecules remain oriented in the space by action of the capture mAb, and ii) an individual control, i.e., a well containing mAb molecules and the blocking protein, can be used for each serum, thus improving detection of individuals having antibodies reacting with either the capture mAb or the proteins used to block the ELISA plates [34] . Further studies are being carried out in our laboratory to investigate if the same strategy can be performed with other Fasciola antigens, such as whole or selected fragments of cathepsins L, to develop robust immunodiagnostic tests without the necessity of obtaining live parasites in abattoirs.",
