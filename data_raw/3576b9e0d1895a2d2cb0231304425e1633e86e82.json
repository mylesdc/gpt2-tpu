Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln 269 -Arg 277 ) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160 gag-pol mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion. The knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design.",

Two antiparallel ahelices of them, a-H (Asn 255 to Ser 268 ) and a-I (Gln 278 to Thr 286 ), are important for holding the primer/template in position during the translocation in polymerization. The primary sequence (Val 254 to Ala 288 ) in the vicinity of these two a helices has been found to share homology with several other nucleic acid polymerases and has been termed the ''helix clamp'' [5, 8] . Extensive studies have been carried out to shed light on the relationship between the ''helix clamp'' and function of RT. The effects of alanine-scanning mutations in a-H and a-I on polymerase activity, primer/template (P/T) binding, fidelity and enzyme kinetics have been determined. While mutations in a-I do not affect P/T binding or fidelity significantly, several a-H mutants exhibit lower binding affinity, processivity and frameshift fidelity [9] [10] [11] [12] . Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in these two helices can have significant effect on RNase H activity, minus-strand DNA transfer activity and removal of polypurine track primer [13, 14] .",

In our previous study on hepatitis B virus RT, conserved residues located at the ''turn'' of helix clamp motif were found important for pregenomic RNA encapsidation during the assembly of nucleocapsids [15, 16] . Since this homologous helix clamp motif is also present in HIV-1 RT, we hypothesized that residues in the turn may play important roles in viral life cycle. Our recent study showed that alanine substitutions at 271 and 274 of HIV-1 RT drastically affected viral replication, but discordance between viral replication and RT activity was observed [17] . In this study, we confirmed our previous observations and further investigated why the two mutations abrogated viral replication. Our study demonstrated that these two mutations lead to rapid degradation of RT in viral particles, indicating that the residues of 271 and 274 are critical for maintaining the stability of HIV RT.",

The results showed that, except for RT (Fig. 2B) , all products of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, IN p32, PR p11 and CA p24, were detected in the mutants Y271A and I274A at a level similar to that of the wild type pseudoviral particles (Fig. 4A) .

To study if the RTs in the viral particles of Y271A and I274A mutants were degraded by proteolysis that made them undetectable, pseudoviruses of wild type and mutants were generated in the presence or absence of indinavir, a highly specific inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Indinavir treatment was effective, because the treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Pr55 Gag processing into p24 for wild type and mutant viruses (Fig. 4B ). As shown in Fig. 4C , in the absence of indinavir, both RT p66 and p51 were readily detected in the wild type pseudovirus, but not in the mutant viruses. In the presence of indinavir, however, both RT p66 and p55 were markedly reduced in the wild type virus but became detectable in mutant Y271A viral particles, while RT p66 was also detectable in mutant I274A virus. We also detected the RT subunits in the viral supernatants collected at earlier time points (12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection), but the mutant RTs were still undetectable (data not shown). These results suggested that the Y271A and I274A",

However, the exact nature of the oligomers formed by mutant p66 subunits remained to be clarified.

As shown in Table 2 , tyrosine (Y) is the predominant naturally existent amino acid at 271 residue (99.19%), while phenylalanine (F), histidine (H) and cysteine (C) occur rarely (,1%). Similarly, isoleucine (I) is the predominant naturally existent amino acid at 274, which accounts for 98.43%, while in less than 2% of all cases, valine (V) and leucine (L) are found at this site. This finding suggested that these amino acids might probably play important role in maintaining the active conformation of RT. Consistently, structural analysis suggested that amino acids at these two sites are buried in the thumb region of RT (Fig. 6A) . It was further revealed that all wild type RTs have relatively big side chains, but they are absent from the mutants 271A and 274A (Fig. 6B & 6C) . Thus, the loss of the side chains in the RT mutants plausibly leads to conformational change of RT, leading to aberrance in dimer formation and susceptibility to proteolysis by HIV-1 protease.",

However, the turn between helices H and I of HIV-1 RT thumb region (amino acid residues 269 to 277) has not been well characterized yet. To understand the structure-function relationship of this turn in details, we investigated whether alanine substitutions in this region would affect RT activity. Except for residues 269 and 270, which have been reported to have no significant influence on RT activity [9, 10] , and for residue 272, which is originally an alanine, six mutant pseudoviruses (residues 271 and 273 to 277) were constructed and viral replication was compared with that of the wild type virus. The replication of two mutants, Y271A and I271A, were found to be almost completely abolished (Fig. 1A) . This result was further confirmed in live virus system (Fig. 1B &  1C) . Since it has been reported that bacterially expressed Y271A mutant has only 1% activity of wild type enzyme [9] , we asked whether the mutants would similarly affect RT activity in the viral particles. The results showed that the RT activity was basically undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants ( Fig. 2A) . It was also found that the loss of RT activity in the viral particles might be attributed to the absence of RT in the viral particles rather than the incorporation of dysfunctional RT into the virions (Fig. 2B) . After viral entry into the cells, the first step of HIV-1 replication is reverse transcription. Our results thus suggested that replication of mutant viruses was abrogated, because the mutant RT did not exist in the virion.",

Our results showed that Pr160 gagpol was properly expressed and transported in cells transfected with mutant constructs, Y271A and I271A (Fig. 3) , indicating that these mutations did not affect either the production of the precursor or the interaction between Pr160 gag-pol and Pr55 gag . It was further found that the Pr160 gag-pol was indeed incorporated into the virions of these two mutants, because except for RT, all other products of Pr160 gag-pol including p24, protease and integrase [31, 32] , could be detected in the viral particles of mutants Y271A and I271A (Fig. 4A) .

Our results also excluded that the mutations of Y271A and I271A affected the cleavage of the Gag-Pol precursor. By a viral protease inhibition assay using indinavir, we finally demonstrated that the RT mutants were degraded after incorporation of the precursor polyprotein into the virions and the degradation was associated with the activity of viral protease (Fig. 4C) .

(C) Structural models of naturally existing 274I, 274V and 274L residues as well as the lethal 274A mutation of p51 subunit. The same region was highlighted above in the right panel of Fig. 6A . A big side chain (pink) is found in naturally occurring residues I, V and L, but not in 274A. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006108.g006 [36] . Another mutation, L289K in p66 subunit, has also been reported to be able to abrogate dimerization [37] . Another group, when they tried to generate infectious molecular clones of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, found that glutamic acid replacement at position 287 affected the stability of RT [38] . The biologically active and stable form of HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of p66 and p51, while the immediate precursor of p66/p51 heterodimer is the p66 homodimer. Proteolytic removal of the RNase H domain in one of the p66 homodimer subunit by HIV-1 protease leads to the formation of stable heterodimer p66/p51 [39] . RT exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers that include the p66/p51 heterodimer and the p66/p66 and p51/p51 homodimers, among which the heterodimer is the most stable and the p51/p51 homodimer is the most unstable [40] [41] [42] [43] . Plausibly, the degradation of RT as reported in previous studies may be ascribed to the inhibition of RT p66 dimerization by the mutations. The mechanism of RT degradation in the virions observed in this study, however, may be different. Our results showed that RT mutants were still undetectable in the viruses generated in the presence of a potent dimerization enhancer (Fig. 5A ). Our native gel analysis showed that the dimer form of RT mutant 271A was detected, although it was markedly reduced as compared to the wild type, while mutant 274A could not form dimer. Instead, higher order oligomers of RT were detected in both mutants (Fig. 5B ). It has been reported that higher order oligomerization may occur in HIV-1 RT [41, 44, 45] . Our results have also indicated that Y271A and I274A substitutions may change the conformation of RT, leading to oligomerization. The higher order oligomers formed in these 2 mutants, perhaps tetramer and octamer, may be associated with instability of RT mutants and their susceptibility to viral protease. Furthermore, according to the locations of residues 271 and 274 (Fig. 6A) , it is highly probable that alanine substitutions at 271 and/or 274 can affect the conformation of p51 thumb region and subsequently its interaction with RNase H domain of p66, resulting in the exposure of the 7-amino-acid p51-RNas H cleavage sequence in the p66 subunit [7, 46] and consequent proteolytic degradation by HIV-1 protease. The relative conservation of RT 271 and 274 residues and the loss of big side chains at these two sites in the mutants as shown in the structural models (Fig. 6B & 6C ) also support their important roles. We tried to demonstrate this in vitro, by treating wild type and mutant RTs with recombinant protease, but wild type RT, as well as mutant RTs, could not be digested in vitro (data not shown). This result is consistent with that reported by Abram and Praniak [36] . This could be explained by different proteolytic stability of RT in vitro and in virions.",

            "text": "Taken together, our study showed that alanine substitutions at residue 271 or 274 of HIV-1 RT could cause conformational changes, rendering RT unstable and susceptible to viral protease. Thus, it is demonstrated that the ''turn'' (Gln 269 -Arg 277 ) between two helices may be important in maintaining protein stability and formation of bioactive dimer. Mutations in residues 271 and 274 of RT may inactivate the virus, which may enter cells but can not replicate. These findings may prove useful in anti-HIV drug design and vaccine development. Considering the emergence of resistance to the current RT inhibitors, this turn, especially amino acid residues 271 and 274, may be an ideal new target for antiviral drug design. The agents targeting this region may be able to affect the stability or dimerization of HIV-1 RT and subsequently inhibit viral replication. Moreover, the potential drug resistant mutations in this region, especially at residues 271 and 274, may probably inactivate the virus, which prevents the appearance of drugresistant virus.",

The infection was determined by the number of blue-staining foci (infectious units) in the cells at 48 h post-infection (original magnification of microscope: 2006). (C) Infection of MT2 cells with wild type as well as Y271A and I274A mutants of live HIV-1. The infection was assessed by observation of virus specific cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cells on day 6 post-infection. Cells were observed under fluorescent microscope (original magnification: 1006). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006108.g001",
