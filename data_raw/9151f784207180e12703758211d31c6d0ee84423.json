            "text": "Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes chronic, economically devastating disease in pigs of all ages. Frequent mutations in the viral genome result in viruses with immune escape mutants. Irrespective of regular vaccination, control of PRRSV remains a challenge to swine farmers. In PRRSV-infected pigs, innate cytokine IFN-\u03b1 is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed. To elucidate both cellular and innate cytokine responses at very early stages of PRRSV infection, seven weeks old pigs maintained on a commercial pig farm were infected and analyzed. Results: One pig in a pen containing 25 pigs was PRRSV infected and responses from this pig and one penmate were assessed two days later. All the infected and a few of the contact neighbor pigs were viremic. At day 2 postinfection, approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and nearly a 1-fold increase in IFN-\u03b1 production was detected in blood of a few pigs. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 (i\u00f1 90%), IL-12 (in~40%), and IL-10 (in~20%) (but not IFN-\u03b3) in PRRSV infected pigs was observed. In addition, reduced frequency of myeloid cells, CD4 -CD8 + T cells, and CD4 + CD8 + T cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural T regulatory cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs. Interestingly, all viremic contact pigs also had comparable immune cell modulations.",

PRRSV-induced immunological changes observed simultaneously at both cellular and cytokine levels early postinfection appear to be responsible for the delay in generation of adaptive immunity. As the study was performed in pigs maintained under commercial environmental conditions, this study has practical implications in design of protective vaccines.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a chronic respiratory and reproductive viral disease of pigs that is responsible for huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. In the US alone, PRRS is estimated to cause losses of $664 million every year [1] . As per the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service report of 2009, 49.8% of unvaccinated pigs in the US are seropositive to PRRS virus (PRRSV), suggesting PRRS an endemic disease in the US, and pig producers have to constantly battle against outbreaks. At present we lack a good understanding of early immunological mechanisms in PRRSV-infected pigs and elucidation of such information could guide us in the development of improved preventive or therapeutic measures. The innate immune system is an important arm of defense to prevent viral invasion and replication to initiate the adaptive arm of the immune system. Adequate early activation of the innate immune system is critical to initiate generation of protective adaptive immunity to achieve complete viral clearance [2] . The quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV appeared to be significantly lower than pigs infected with a swine influenza virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus [3] [4] [5] . Natural killer (NK) cell, a lymphocyte subpopulation, provides a first line of innate defense against virus infection [6] . In pigs, NK cells are small to medium sized lymphocytes and they lack adequate intracellular granules [7, 8] . Therefore, although younger pigs possess a higher frequency of NK cells, they have reduced NK cytolytic activity [9] . Unfortunately, PRRSV further suppresses the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in infected pigs [10, 11] . So far, studies addressing cytokine profiles and NK cell cytotoxic functions have been performed in pigs from 1 week post-PRRSV infection and under controlled experimental conditions. PRRSV is known to suppress production of an important innate antiviral cytokine, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 [12] [13] [14] . IFN-\u03b3 response in PRRSV-infected pigs appears to be dampened and delayed [13, 15, 16] . The Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles provide an elegant model of directed response to infectious pathogens and are indicative of immune regulation, protective immunity, and vaccine efficacy. The Th2 cytokine IL-4 is involved in suppression of pathogen-specific Th1 immune responses [17, 18] , but the role of IL-4 in the pig immune system appears to be different [19, 20] . Lymphocytes expressing markers CD4 or CD8 alone and CD4 and CD8 together are important in viral clearance by secreting IFN-\u03b3 and mediating pathogen specific cytotoxicity [21] [22] [23] [24] . Foxp3expressing CD4 + CD25 + cells with immunosuppressive properties, called \"T-regulatory cells (Tregs)\", have been identified in pigs [25] . PRRSV-mediated proliferation of Tregs in infected and vaccinated pigs suggests the involvement of Tregs in disease progression and immune modulation [11, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The mechanism of immune suppression in PRRSV-infected pigs appears to be governed by enhanced production of interleukin (IL)-10 [10, 31, 32] , which drives the generation of IL-10-producing Tregs [33] . However, it has also been shown that IL-10 expression varies with infection using different strains of the PRRSV (Diaz et al., 2006); thus, it is unclear if Treg-mediated suppression of immune response occurs with all the strains of PRRSV.",

It is known that younger pigs suffer severely from PRRS than adult animals [32] , likely resulting from poorly developed innate immune system or an efficient immune evasion strategy adapted by the virus. Innate NK cells are the lymphocyte subpopulation known for their ability to provide the first line of defense against viral infections [6] . Younger pigs have underdeveloped NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function [7, 9] , and in our study, approximately 50% of pigs at day 0 (preinfection) did not have detectable NK cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, in pigs with satisfactory NK cell cytotoxicity, PRRSV significantly suppresses the NK function by 50-80% from post-infection day 7-24 [10] .",

In addition, an increased frequency in NK cells rich fraction in virus-infected pigs did not result in rescued NK cytotoxicity, suggesting PRRSV-induced modulation in NK cell function. This could be one of the innate immune evasion mechanisms of PRRSV. All pigs with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity were viremic with titers greater than 2 logs, suggesting replicating PRRSV mediated suppression of NK cell function. In pigs, a precise selection marker for phenotypic analysis of NK cells is not available, however, CD56 is used in some studies [36, 37] . Recently, we identified comparable frequency of CD56 + and CD3 -CD4 -CD8\u03b1 + cells in the pig PBMC (data not shown). PRRSV is a poor inducer of IFN-\u03b1 and its level remains low throughout the course of infection [12, 13, 38] . Suppression of IFN-\u03b1 production in PRRSV infected pigs is mediated by viral nsp1\u03b2 [39] . In vitro stimulation of porcine monocytes and macrophages with low levels of IFN-\u03b1 (10 units/ml) stimulates increased expression of sialoadhesin, the receptor required for PRRSV internalization in macrophages. Interestingly, such a stimulation of macrophages for the initial 2-3 days is sufficient to enhance the efficiency of PRRSV infection by nearly 20-fold [40] . Consistent with that, our results identified a slight increase in IFN-\u03b1 production early post-infection in greater than 50% of PRRSVinfected pigs which maybe sufficient to augment the yield of replicating PRRSV.",

Enhanced production of IL-4 in greater than 90% of PRRSV-infected pigs detected in our study appears to be having an important immune modulatory role on NK cell function. In both mice and humans, IL-4 is essential for antibody production and is a soluble diagnostic marker of Th2 immune response. In contrast, IL-4 is not a stimulatory factor for porcine B cells, and in fact in pigs, IL-4 blocks antibody and IL-6 secretion and also suppresses antigen-stimulated proliferation of B cells [19] . IL-4 suppresses the transcriptional activity of all the inflammatory cytokines and plays an important role in regulation of inflammatory activity of pig alveolar macrophages in respiratory disease conditions [20] . Therefore, the role of IL-4 in pigs is different compared to mice and humans. Overall, our study has demonstrated the correlative evidences on PRRSV-mediated suppression of NK cell function by coordinated modulation of multiple cytokines.",

Although, increased secretion of IL-12 in PRRSVinfected pigs was detected early post-infection in our study, secretion of IFN-\u03b3 remained low. 2 days postinfection maybe too early to expect IFN-\u03b3 production, but PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 did not increase the IFN-\u03b3 secretion even after 3 weeks postinfection [10] . Generally, IL-12 is a heterodimer consisting of p40 and p35 subunits [50, 51] , and it is a critical regulator of T and NK cell functions [52, 53] . But IL-12 can also exist as a p40 homodimer which is a potent antagonist of immune responses [54] . The cytokine IL-12 mediates multiple roles in the immune system which include activation of macrophages during intracellular infection [55] . At present, reagents to differentiate homo-and heterodimers of porcine IL-12 are not available. Interestingly, our data further confirmed that PRRSV-induced enhanced IL-12 is not helping to elicit protective immunity against PRRSV infection. PRRSV has restricted cell tropism, with differentiated macrophages expressing various receptor molecules such as heparin sulphate, sialoadhesin, and CD163, which all aid in PRRSV invasion [56] [57] [58] . Therefore, PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 might be involved in differentiation of macrophages which aids viral infection. However, targeted approach to investigate such a mechanism of action of IL-12 in PRRSV-infected pigs is important.",

In addition, enhanced production of the cytokines, IL-4, IL-12, and IL-10, and reduction in the population immune cells (CD8, + Th/memory, and myeloid cells) were also mediated by replicating PRRSV. Our results have practical relevance as the study was performed in pigs maintained under natural environmental conditions. This knowledge may benefit PRRSV researchers to consider innovative strategies to circumvent the virus induced suppressive mechanisms during design of effective vaccines.",

Nursery pigs were from a herd free of PRRSV and experimental pigs were seronegative at the beginning of the experiment (Herd-Chek PRRS ELISA, IDEXX). Twenty-five pens were selected at random out of 40 pens in a room for this study. In each pen, two pigs were selected at random and ear-tagged. The 50 pigs from 25 pens were bled and one of the two tagged pigs in each pen was injected with 2 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of PRRSV strain MN 1-18-2 [63, 64] , intramuscularly. The other pig was an uninoculated (mock) contact control. Pigs were bled again 2 days after infection and samples were paired by animal to facilitate statistical analysis. All the pigs were maintained and samples collected as per the protocol approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC), University of Minnesota.",

Effectors were incubated in RPMI supplemented with FBS with a fixed number of targets for 24 h at 37C in a CO 2 incubator and the amount of released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the supernatant was measured by a colorimetric assay.
