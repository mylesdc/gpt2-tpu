            "text": "This paper investigates the dynamics of infectious diseases with a nonexponentially distributed infectious period. This is achieved by considering a multistage infection model on networks. Using pairwise approximation with a standard closure, a number of important characteristics of disease dynamics are derived analytically, including the final size of an epidemic and a threshold for epidemic outbreaks, and it is shown how these quantities depend on disease characteristics, as well as the number of disease stages. Stochastic simulations of dynamics on networks are performed and compared to output of pairwise models for several realistic examples of infectious diseases to illustrate the role played by the number of stages in the disease dynamics. These results show that a higher number of disease stages results in faster epidemic outbreaks with a higher peak prevalence and a larger final size of the epidemic. The agreement between the pairwise and simulation models is excellent in the cases we consider.",

In many cases, to obtain the first approximation of the spread of a disease, it is sufficient to use a version of the classical SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . However, major outbreaks of avian and swine influenza (Ferguson et al. 2006) , SARS and, more recently, Ebola (Chowell and Nishiura 2014) have highlighted the need for a more accurate description of the disease dynamics that would provide predictive power to be used for developing measures for disease control and prevention (Keeling and Rohani 2008) .",

            "text": "One of the major simplifying assumptions often used in mathematical models of disease dynamics is the exponential distribution of infectious periods. Effectively, this means that the chance of an individual recovering during any given time period does not depend on the duration of time that individual has already been infected. Whilst such an assumption may provide significant mathematical convenience and be reasonably realistic in some situations, most often it is violated, and this requires the inclusion of the precise distribution of infectious periods in the model (Bailey 1954; Hope-Simpson 1952) . There are several methods that can be employed to explicitly include a non-exponential distribution, including a multi-stage approach (Anderson and Watson 1980; Cox and Miller 1965) , an integro-differential formulation (Kermack and McKendrick 1927; Hethcote and Tudor 1980; Keeling and Grenfell 1997) and a PDE-based formulation akin to that for age-structured models (Anderson and May 1992) . In the multi-stage framework, it is assumed that the infectious stage of a disease is characterised by a number K of distinct stages (Cox and Miller 1965; Lloyd 2000 Lloyd , 2001 , with the duration of each stage being an independent exponentially distributed random number. Due to the fact that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables obeys a gamma distribution (Durrett 2010) , one can replace an exponential distribution with the mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 by a gamma distribution \u0393 (K , 1/(K \u03b3 )) that has the same mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 . The so-called linear chain trick (Cox and Miller 1965; MacDonald 1978) then consists in replacing a single infectious stage with K identical exponentially distributed sub-stages, each having a mean period 1/(K \u03b3 ). These multiple stages of infection can be used to represent periods of increased or decreased risk of transmitting the disease (Ma and Earn 2006) . The same approach can be extended to models with multiple classes (Keeling and Grenfell 2002; Nguyen and Rohani 2008) , as well as non-exponentially distributed latency and temporary immunity periods (Blyuss and Kyrychko 2010; Wearing et al. 2005) . Following the methodology of introducing multi-stage of infection to better represent the distribution of infectious periods, we proceed with dividing the infected population into K identical stages I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I K to create the so-called S I K R model (Lloyd 2000) , and we denote the total infected population by I = K i=1 I i . One should note that K \u03b3 is now used as the transition rate between successive infectious stages in order to keep the average duration of infection as 1/\u03b3 . With these notations, the S I K R model takes the form dS/dt = \u2212\u03b2 S I,",

(1978) where S denotes the proportion of susceptible individuals, R is the proportion of recovered or removed individuals, \u03b2 is the disease transmission rate taken to be the same for all stages of infection, and the disease is assumed to confer a lifelong immunity. The importance of including not just the mean infectious period, but the actual distribution of infectious periods, as achieved by the system (1) is further highlighted by the inspection of actual values of epidemiological parameters for several real diseases as presented in Table 1 . This table illustrates that whilst the transmission rate and the average infectious period may vary between different diseases, in all of these cases the number of stages that has to be included in order to correctly represent the disease dynamics may also be quite high, and this reinforces an earlier observation about the non-exponential nature of infectious period distribution. Whilst this method of introducing multiple stages of infection is clearly more realistic, the assumption of a homogeneous fully mixed population remains very important, having significant effects on the disease dynamics (Keeling and Rohani 2008) . Although this assumption often provides a good approximation that helps reduce complexity of the model, in many cases it is just not realistic and results in erroneous conclusions about the onset and development of epidemic outbreaks (Bansal et al. 2007; Burr and Chowell 2008) . To address this issue, networks have been and are being used successfully to model the contact structure of the population to a high degree of detail (Danon et al. 2011; Keeling and Eames 2005) . Typically, network models are parameterised with empirical data or synthetic models that can be either purely theoretical, e.g. homogeneous random networks or Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, or obey some widely observed network characteristics, such as a particular degree distribution or clustering. However, with added model realism comes complexity, which in the case of epidemic network models can be handled via mean-field models, such as pairwise models (Keeling 1999; House and Keeling 2011) that are able to better account for the explicit nature of network links. As long as such mean-field models provide a good approximation to the explicit stochastic network models, they open up the possibility to analytically compute important quantities such as epidemic threshold and final epidemic size. Thus, the explicit stochastic network simulation model and the pairwise model combine favourably to provide a more accurate model with some degree of analytical tractability.",

In Sect. 3, we employ the framework of pairwise approximations to derive a multi-stage infection pairwise model and use this to derive analytical expressions for the probability of transmission of infection along an infected edge in a network, a threshold parameter controlling the onset of epidemic outbreaks and the final size of an epidemic. In Sect. 4, numerical simulations of the pairwise and the full network models are performed using realistic parameter values from Table 1 to investigate the accuracy of pairwise approximation and to illustrate the role played by the number of stages in the multi-stage distribution in the disease dynamics. The paper concludes in Sect. 5 with discussion of results and future outlook.",

Ma and Earn (2006) have recently discussed various aspects related to the derivation and validity of formula (3), and Andreasen (2011) Fig. 1 A comparison of infection dynamics for a one-, three-and five-stage S I K R models with data from Keeling and Rohani (2008) . Each curve represents the sum of all I i in the model. Adding extra stages causes epidemics to occur earlier and result in a higher peak of epidemic, although R 0 and the final size are identical for each curve. The parameter values are N = 1000, \u03b2 = 1.66/day, \u03b3 = 0.4545/day the effects of population heterogeneity on the size of epidemic. A major implication of the above results is the fact that inclusion of possibly more realistic gamma distribution of infectious periods does not alter the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, nor does it affect the final epidemic size. One should note, however, that when a stochastic version of the S I K R model is considered, the number of stages influences the distribution of final epidemic sizes, whilst the average final size remains the same (Black and Ross 2015; House et al. 2013) . We see that in Fig. 1 the three curves show that considering multi-stage infectious periods has a significant effect of the dynamics of the epidemic. In order to get a better understanding of the distinction in the dynamics of SIR and S I K R models, it is therefore instructive to look at the development of epidemics. In the standard SIR model, an outbreak can only take place if R 0 > 1, and at the initial stage, the number of infected individuals can be approximated as I (t) \u2248 I (0) exp(\u03bbt), where the growth rate is \u03bb = \u03b3 (R 0 \u2212 1). In the case of a multi-stage S I K R model, however, the basic reproduction number R 0 does not depend on the number of stages; hence, it cannot by itself be used to determine the exponential growth rate during an early stage of an outbreak. For this model, Wearing et al. (2005) have derived the following relation between the basic reproduction number R 0 and the initial growth rate \u03bb",

Whilst this may be appropriate in the case of outbreaks in small closed communities, for a large number of communicable diseases, such as SARS, influenza and most sexually transmitted infections, this assumption is a gross simplification of the actual dynamics as it overlooks spatial variability, as well as the complexities of a network structure for infections that are transmitted through direct close contact between individuals (House and Keeling 2011; Keeling and Eames 2005) .",

This new modelling framework has led to a myriad of models ranging from exact to mean-field and simulation models (Pastor-Satorras et al. 2014; Danon et al. 2011; Keeling and Eames 2005; Newman 2003; Boccaletti et al. 2006) . The many degrees of freedom in modelling offered by networks, however, often comes at the price of increasing levels of complexity, where models can be challenging to evaluate analytically and sometimes even numerically. Nevertheless, many valuable paradigm models have been developed which have furthered our understanding of the impact of contact heterogeneity, preferential mixing and clustering on the outbreak threshold and other epidemic descriptors. A particularly useful way of capturing epidemic dynamics on networks is by using the pairwise model (Keeling 1999) . This model is based around deriving in a hierarchical way evolution equations for the expected number of nodes, edges, triples and so on. A closure is then employed that curtails the dependence on ever higher-order moments. Its premise is simple and quite intuitive, although it can be also shown rigorously (Taylor et al. 2012 ) that pairwise models before closure are exact. The basic idea of the model is to recognise that changes at node level depend on the status of the neighbours and thus involves edges, e.g. the rate of change in the number of infectious nodes is proportional to the number of S\u2212I links in the network. Similarly, the number of edges can change due to pair interactions and transitions but also due to interactions induced from outside the edge, e.g. the number of S\u2212S links decrease proportionally to the number of S\u2212S\u2212I triples, where infection from the I node destroys the fully susceptible pair. This framework has been used and extended extensively, to asymmetric (Sharkey et al. 2006 ) and weighted networks (Rattana et al. 2013) for example, and has proved to be a valuable framework.",

The particular strength of pairwise models lies in their analytical tractability and the fact that they provide a more accurate description than well-mixed ODE models but do not go to the level of full individual-based stochastic simulations (House and Keeling 2011) . In this formalism of pairwise models, notations [X], [XY ] and [XYZ] are used to denote the expected numbers of individuals in state X , the expected number of links between nodes of type X and Y and the expected number of triples of the form X \u2212Y \u2212Z , respectively. More precisely, given a \"frozen\" network with nodes labels X , Y or Z and subscripts indicating nodes i, j and k, then j=1,2,.. .,N is the adjacency matrix of the network such that g ii = 0, g i j = g ji and g i j = g ji = 1 if nodes i and j are connected and zero otherwise. Moreover, X i returns one if node i is in state X and zero otherwise. The average degree of each node is denoted by n and the number of nodes in the network by N . The new pairwise S I K R model with a gamma-distributed infectious period can then be written as follows,",

Intuitively, this means that the epidemic is allowed to spread in order to become established in the network. This allows for typical infectious individuals to develop and for R 0 to be measured.

            "text": "We note that our result in Theorem 1 is functionally identical to the result achieved by Keeling (1999) , and it generalises the final size equation by replacing \u03c4/(\u03c4 + \u03b3 ) with the parameter\u03c4 . In the case K = 1 these two values are equivalent, and thus, we have perfect agreement with the existing theory. Equivalent relations have also been derived by Newman (2002) using percolation theory. Those results were later corrected and shown to hold in all cases where the distribution of infectious periods is degenerative (Kenah and Robins 2007 ). An equivalent relation has been derived for a static configuration network model with an arbitrary degree distribution (Miller 2012) . Figure 4 illustrates Theorem 1 by showing how the final size of an epidemic on a network depends on the number of infectious stages and, hence, the shape of the distribution of infectious period, which makes it different from earlier analytical results for a well-mixed population (Ma and Earn 2006) . This suggests that inclusion of a more realistic population structure has effect not only on the intermediate disease dynamics, but also on the final proportion of the population that will be affected by the disease. Furthermore, this figure suggests that for the same mean infectious period, the final size of an epidemic is increasing with the increasing number of stages K . One should note that the number of stages K has the largest effect on the final size of an epidemic for sufficiently low values of K , and then, this dependence saturates. . Circles correspond to integer values of K on each curve. The case n = 2 is used solely for illustrative purposes, as the resulting networks would be disconnected and thus inappropriate for direct comparison to results from the pairwise model As expected, the average node degree n plays an important role, with the minimum value of \u03c4 or K required for an epidemic outbreak decreasing with increasing n in perfect agreement with an earlier result in Eq. (11). Stochastic simulations (not shown) demonstrate excellent agreement with the results in Fig. 4 , especially for denser networks. The conclusions of Theorem 1 highlight the importance of collecting accurate and reliable data about the infectivity profile of a disease for predicting the scale of an outbreak.",

Several papers have modelled the effectiveness of smallpox when used as a bio-weapon, as well strategies for its containment during possible outbreaks (Ferguson et al. 2003; Kaplan et al. 2002; Meltzer et al. 2001 ). Due to a profound impact smallpox has had on a human population over several centuries, an extensive and quite accurate data have been collected about its transmission. Smallpox is spread through a contact with the mucus of an infected individual, which implies that a close contact is essential for a successful disease transmission. In Fig. 7 , we show the simulations of smallpox outbreaks on homogeneous and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks using parameter values from Table 1 compared to results of the numerical solution of the corresponding pairwise model (5). The first important observation that the higher severity of epidemics outbreaks as suggested by these data makes the pairwise which is consistent with an earlier observation that the effect of increasing the number of stages on the final epidemic size is less noticeable for higher K . Figure 8 illustrates the comparison of a pairwise model (5) with the closure (6) and a stochastic simulation on the example of influenza data with different number of stages of infection. Comparison of figures (a) and (b) shows that the heterogeneity introduced by the degree distribution makes the pairwise model less accurate due to the fact that this model only takes into account the mean degree n. This suggests that whilst our model is very helpful for understanding general features of multi-stage disease dynamics on networks, it has to be extended further to deal effectively with wider and more realistic node degree distributions. One should note that the effects of increasing the number of stages on peak prevalence and the duration of epidemics reduce for higher values of K , as can be observed by comparing the minor changes between temporal profiles of the three-and five-stage influenza epidemics presented as shown in Fig. 8 .",

This has allowed us to determine the probability of disease transmission across a network edge and to find an R 0 -like threshold that controls the onset of epidemics. We have also derived an analytical expression for the final size of an epidemic, which is in perfect agreement with the final size computed using percolation theory (Newman 2002; Kenah and Robins 2007) , and therefore, our findings can be considered exact in the limit of infinite population size. All of these quantities depend not only on the basic disease characteristics, such as the transmission rate and the average infectious period, but also on the distribution of the infectious period as represented by the number of stages in the model. The importance of this result lies in the fact that unlike earlier studies of multi-stage models in well-mixed populations (Anderson and Watson 1980; Ma and Earn 2006) , for the same average duration of the infection period, the final epidemic size is not constant but increasing with the number of stages. We also observe that the threshold at which point a major epidemic is expected depends on the number of infectious stages, with epidemics becoming more likely as the number of stages is increased. This dependence emerges due to the higher resolution of our model which allows us to identify new links between model ingredients and disease dynamics. Similar results have been noted in related studies, for example, in models concerned with contact tracing (Eames and Keeling 2003) and models of coupled disease and information transmission on networks (Funk et al. 2009 ).",

Whilst inclusion of latent classes may have no effect on the basic reproduction number or the final size distribution in a homogeneous model (Black and Ross 2015; House et al. 2013) , whether the same would be true in a network model remains to be seen. Another interesting and important problem would be the consideration of network dynamics for epidemic models with temporary immunity (Blyuss and Kyrychko 2010) . Allowing the level of infectiousness of different nodes to vary depending on the stage of infection they belong to would result in even more realistic models of multi-stage diseases on networks. One of the challenging but practically important generalisations of the present framework would be an extension of a pairwise model that would account for heterogeneity in node degree distribution (House and Keeling 2011) . This would provide deterministic models potentially amenable to analytical treatment that would more accurately represent stochastic disease dynamics.",
