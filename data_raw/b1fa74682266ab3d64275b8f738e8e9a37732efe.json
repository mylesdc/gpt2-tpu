Compared to the local priors used in the main analysis, this change mainly aects the prior on \u03c1, which was estimated in French Polynesia to be lower for ZIKV than for CHIKV (\u03b2 \u03c1 was estimated to 0.46 with 95% credible interval 0.42-0.50), while the estimates of R 0 were similar for both diseases (\u03b2 R0 was estimated to 1.03 with 95% credible interval 0.90-1.18). The results show that omitting the ratios between ZIKV and CHIKV consistently leads to signicantly lower forecasting accuracy (Fig. D) .

Compared to the local priors built for Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint-Martin using data from these islands, this change leads to consistently higher priors on R 0 , centered around 2 (Fig. ??) . The modications induced on the priors on \u03c1 dier for each island. For instance, the estimates of \u03c1 in Mo'orea, the Sous-le-vent islands and Tahiti concentrated around 0.15 are very close to the local prior on \u03c1 applied to Guadeloupe, while they are higher in the Australes, Marquises and Tuamotu islands. These dierences in the range of prior specication translate into dierences in forecasting accuracy (Fig. E) , with a large drop in accuracy when using estimates from the Australes, Marquises or Tuamotu islands as priors. In Martinique and Saint-Martin, local priors computed according to our approach led to better results than priors directly taken from any area of French Polynesia at the early stages. In Guadeloupe however, the accuracy obtained with priors from Sous-le-vent, Tahiti or Mo'orea was similar to that obtained with local priors computed according to our approach. This sensitivity analysis emphasizes that directly using the estimates obtained from an epidemic of the same pathogen in a dierent location might lead to prior misspecications causing large inaccuracies in some cases.

This suggests that prior information is essentially required for the reporting rate, a dicult-to-estimate quantity as already noted in [?] . In a sensitivity analysis, we test this hypothesis, by testing separately the informative priors given on R 0 and on \u03c1. The results conrm the greater importance of using informative priors on \u03c1 in forecasting accuracy (Fig. F) . Indeed, after the rst 2-4 weeks of circulation, by providing a prior for \u03c1 only we obtain the same accuracy as providing priors for \u03c1 and R 0 . This small delay is coherent with Fig. 5 of the main paper, which shows that R 0 estimates are close to the nal ones from weeks 2-4. ",

No hierarchical structure was introduced for this parameter, which was thus considered the same in every island. Moreover, we did not consider meaningful to adjust the estimate of \u03c6 obtain during the CHIKV epidemics in the French West for ZIKV, and this directly used this estimate as prior for the ZIKV epidemics in the region.

This study, contrary to[?], revolved around producing forecasts of the future course of the epidemic in real time. While including meteorological predictions might bring additional improvements to forecast quality, we decided for the sake of simplicity to ignore the inuence of local temperature on the serial interval and assume a constant temperature of 28\u2022 C for the whole duration of the epidemics. In the following, we made the assumption that the main vector of ZIKV and CHIKV was Ae. aegypti. This was decided considering that Ae. aegypti is a competent vector of both viruses and is widely prevalent in the concerned areas[?, ?, ?, ?]. We thus searched for published estimates of these three parameters in laboratory or preferably eld studies involving Ae. aegypti(Table C).Range of the duration of the infec-",
