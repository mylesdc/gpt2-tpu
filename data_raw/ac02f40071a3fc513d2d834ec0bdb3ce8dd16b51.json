            "text": "When analysing new emerging infectious disease outbreaks, one typically has observational data over a limited period of time and several parameters to estimate, such as growth rate, the basic reproduction number R 0 , the case fatality rate and distributions of serial intervals, generation times, latency and incubation times and times between onset of symptoms, notification, death and recovery/discharge. These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on: contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R 0 and growth rate. We propose methods to remove or at least reduce bias using statistical modelling. We illustrate the theory by numerical examples and simulations.",

What these outbreaks have in common is the need for estimation of key parameters early on, in order to plan interventions and monitor the progress of the disease. Thus estimation must be performed in the emerging phase of an outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is in the hundreds or at most thousands, while the community fraction of infected is still small. Typically, the early numbers grow exponentially, as also predicted by mathematical epidemic models [1] .",

The aim of the present paper is to identify and highlight some of the potential biases in the statistical analysis of emerging outbreaks and to illustrate how they can propagate to parameter estimates and predictions.

The use of simple models in these situations is motivated by the lack of detailed information but has also recently been studied [2] , showing that neglecting population structures when making inference in emerging & 2019 The Authors. Published by the Royal Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution outbreaks has little effect. However, estimation in simple models can still be quite complicated. The complications are mainly due to three factors: (1) important events, such as times of infection, are usually unobserved, but instead some proxy measures such as onset of symptoms are available, (2) estimation of parameters of the epidemic process is based on observations up to some fixed time, implying that events occurring later are censored and (3) the population of infectives is increasing (exponentially) with time.",

The second problem we study is the effect of replacing generation times (the time between infections of an infector and an infectee) with the more commonly observed serial intervals (the time between onset of symptoms of an infector and an infectee). A third problem we discuss is how to treat the common situation, when contact tracing, of finding more than one potential infector of a case, with the implication that the backward generation time or incubation time (time from infection to symptoms) is one out of several possible values. As it turns out, the potential biasing effects of these problems all go in the same direction and, for example, the basic reproduction number R 0 (the average number of infections in a fully susceptible population) can be quite significantly underestimated. We also point out some general stability properties of ratios during exponential growth that may be useful for inference. We then quantify the various biases that can arise in realistic parameter settings, both theoretically and by simulation, mostly using parameters freely adapted from the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa [3] .",

            "text": "Predictions are made assuming that the disease spreading mechanism continues unaltered, reflecting what would presumably happen in the absence of control measures (these predictions should then be compared with predictions including various preventive measures). Traditionally, the population effects of such an infection have been modelled using compartmental models with separate states, for example, susceptible, latent (historically called exposed and hence abbreviated by E), infectious or recovered/removed individuals (SI, SEI, SIR and SEIR models; e.g. [1, 4] ). Recently, modelling has reverted to something akin to the original Kermack & McKendrick [5] formulation, with emphasis on one single quantity, b(s), the average rate at which an infected individual infects new individuals s time units after his/her time of infection, denoted the infection rate or infectivity function. The assumption of a homogeneous community implies that b(s) is the same for all individuals, and the assumptions of no depletion of susceptibles, no preventive measures and no seasonal effects imply that b(s) is independent of the time of infection of the individual. The previously mentioned compartmental models can all be translated to this framework. While the original treatment of the Kermack -McKendrick model was deterministic (Volterra-type integral equations), statistical modelling requires a stochastic formulation which, in this case, corresponds to a Crump-Mode -Jagers branching process [6] in the initial phase of spread. It should be noted that the infectivity functions in a stochastic model may be different from individual to individual, although the average behaviour is the same, and that different stochastic models may have the same average behaviour [7] .",

This seemingly innocent choice of looking backwards rather than forwards in time (measuring duration backwards from an infectee rather than forwards from an infector) actually modifies the distribution of observed times in the early stage of an outbreak when the epidemic grows at an exponential rate (e.g. [17] [18] [19] ). The reason is that, by looking backwards in time, long generation times will be underrepresented and short generation times will be overrepresented because exponential growth implies that there are many more recently infected individuals who are potential infectors compared to those infected longer ago. As a consequence, if the generation time distribution is estimated from a sample of backward generation times, the resulting distribution f B (s) will be different from the true generation time distribution f G (s).",

The problem reemerged during the SARS pandemic in the early 2000s (e.g. [24, 25] ), but again with data limited to single exposures during known time intervals.

Interface 16: 20180670 Let us start by considering the problem of estimating the incubation period distribution, i.e. the time from infection to symptoms, in the simplest model possible allowing for multiple infection exposures and to formulate an appropriate likelihood. Consider one infected individual with onset of symptoms at time s that has been traced for previous infectious contacts and assume that these exposures took place at the time points e 1 , . . ., e k , where e 1 . . . e k , s. In order to obtain a likelihood, we introduce some notation and assumptions. Suppose that at time t, the rate of infection exposure equals l(t), and that the probability of infection upon exposure equals p (the same p for all contacts whether with the same or different infected individuals; if more detailed contact information is available it would be possible to have different p's for different types of contacts and/or different individuals). Finally, let g(t) denote the density distribution of the incubation period.

It is of course possible to also study more complicated models allowing for individual heterogeneity in susceptibility and/ or various types of contacts having different transmission probabilities, both at distinct times and also during extended periods, e.g. household contacts, but here we consider the simplest model still taking multiple exposures into account, compatible with limited data, only number and times of contacts and time of symptoms. Were data to be different, e.g. containing genetic information from whole genome sequencing of the pathogens, different models would be possible (e.g. [26] ). One can imagine several ways to try to avoid the multiple exposures problem. One approach could be to simply assume that the earliest potential infector is the infector, the likelihood contribution related to the incubation time distribution simplifying to g(s 2 e 1 ) (this would approximately be the same as equation (5.1) if p % 1). This would however certainly lead to the duration of incubation periods being overestimated. The opposite approach, to pretend that the most recent contact was the infector, would similarly lead to underestimation. A type of compromise could be to treat all potential contacts as being potential infection times (to different cases). As a consequence, one observation with k multiple potential infectors would then result in k independent incubation periods s 2 e 1 , . . ., s 2 e k , and the likelihood contribution would become Q k i\u00bc1 g(s \u00c0 e i ). Compared to the likelihood in equation (5.1), where the shorter incubation periods are given relatively lower weight due to the factor (1 2 p) i21 , such an analysis would lead to the incubation periods (and serial intervals) being underestimated and the precision of the biased estimate overestimated because of the apparent higher number of data points. A related assumption, leading to the same conclusion, would be to treat all potential exposures as equally likely (which would approximately hold true if p % 0).",

This clearly increases uncertainty by using fewer data points. However, it also leads to biased estimates, as we now explain. Individuals having only one exposure and then symptoms must have been infected at this exposure and thus their infection history is certain. However, the fact that no other exposures have happened during the incubation period favours shorter than usual intervals. In fact, the observed time interval will be distributed as the minimum of a typical 'inter-exposure time' and a generic incubation time, and will thus have a distribution different from a generic incubation time, leading to underestimation. In order to obtain explicit expressions for the size of the bias, explicit models of the 'exposure process' and the incubation time distribution are required.",

Simulations show that this approach works well if the correct parametric form is adopted (see the electronic supplementary material).

For the recent Ebola epidemic, it is found [3] that the incubation period distribution f D , assumed to be equal to that of the latent period, is Gamma distributed with mean 11.4 days and s.d. \u00bc 8.1 days and that generation times are Gamma distributed with mean 15.3 days and s.d. \u00bc 9.3 days.

We will use the above parameter values for this example. With the complete data, it would have been possible to estimate the contact rate l and the probability p to get infected by a close Ebola contact separately. Here we can only use that 25% had a single contact. We simply assume that p \u00bc 0.5 and equate P(a single contact) \u00bc p Thus, the mean incubation period for infectees with only one potential infector will be 11.4 2 8.1 \u00bc 3.3 days shorter than the mean incubation period had all observations been used.

Assuming that the standard deviation remains unchanged (\u00bc 9.3 days), the estimated generation time distribution would be Gamma distributed with mean 12 and s.d. \u00bc 9.3 days. Using this generation time distribution, instead of the true one, in equation (2.4), assuming r \u00bc 0.0383 to be known (e.g. estimated from the observed growth rate), leads to R 0single \u00bc 1.50, an underestimation of 12%. Conversely, assuming R 0 \u00bc 1.7, the exponential growth rate estimated from the contact traced individuals having only a single unique infector would approximately equal r single \u00bc 0.0522, which overestimates the true value by 36%.",

If the incubation period has a distribution differing from the assumed (gamma) model distribution (the log-normal distribution, in our simulation), the moment-estimators still perform well, but the maximum-likelihood estimates of mean and variance derived under the assumption of gamma distributed incubation times now acquire some bias. The speed of convergence of estimates and further properties under misspecification of assumptions need further study, but this initial experiment shows that unbiased estimation based on all observations is possible.",

We have studied three potential sources of bias: (1) backward estimation of generation times (contact tracing), (2) using serial intervals instead of generation times and (3) contact tracing leading to several potential infectors thus making the time of infection uncertain. Importantly, all three sources lead to biases in the same direction, causing the basic reproduction number R 0 to be underestimated if the epidemic growth rate r is correctly estimated. The converse is also true, namely that the growth rate will be overestimated if a correct estimate of R 0 is available, but this situation is likely to be less common in practice.",

To evaluate the combined biasing effect in this setting is a complicated exercise, depending on exactly how estimation is performed and presented but, assuming independence (i.e. multiplicative action), the total effect could be as large as, for example, 23% underestimation of R 0 (assuming a 50% increase in the coefficient of variation of the serial interval). In other settings, the effects could be quite different. In the main sections and in the corresponding sections of the electronic supplementary material, general formulae, if possible, or at least formulae under assumptions of Gamma distributions, if results depend on assumed distributions, are available and applicable in other parameter settings. It should be noted that even moderate errors in R 0 , especially if the true value is not very large, can have large royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 16: 20180670 consequences. As numerical illustration, assume that the true value of R 0 is 1.7, but that the estimate is negatively biased by 10% or even 23%, depending on how estimation is performed. Then the biased estimate would be around 1.53 or 1.31, respectively. Such a difference can have quite large consequences when planning control measures. For instance, the critical immunization level (both for vaccination and any other measure aimed at reducing infection) is usually calculated as v c \u00bc 1 2 1/R 0 . For the true R 0 , this results in v c \u00bc 41%, while the lower biased estimates yieldv c \u00bc 35% or 24%, respectively. The underestimation of R 0 may hence lead to suggested preventive measures that are insufficient to stop the spread.",

However, there are also some positive observations. The stability of proportions of individuals in different phases of disease during the increasing phase is one, since quite good estimates of the total number of infected or not yet notified infected could be made, based on number of dead patients or notified ones, if good information about the related stage duration distributions is available. Another positive observation is that accurate inference in the multiple infector problem seems possible, although more research is needed. Finally, many biases can be understood and corrected for if the sampling situation is correctly modelled. It may be difficult to obtain simple analytical results, but simulation can then reveal the performance of various estimation procedures.",

This will improve the statistical analyses in that the model better describes the spreading patterns of the disease. The biases under focus in the present paper will however remain, but it is an open problem to study if they are reduced or increased when compared with the present homogeneous modelling assumptions. The results in this paper also indicate what other types of data would have been useful to avoid or decrease the discussed biases. For instance, more detailed observation of the joint distribution, or at least first and second order moments, of the various phases of the disease history (incubation, latency, infectiousness, etc.) would have improved the conversion of serial intervals to generation times; genotyping of the infectious agent in infected individuals may improve inference about infection chains and thus avoid the multiple infector problem and also allow direct estimation of R 0 in infection trees.",

A rather different type of potential source of bias, also not studied here, is when model assumptions are violated. For example, it has been assumed that there was no individual or society-induced changing behaviour during the data collection period, and social or spatial effects on spreading patterns have been ignored. Social structures have been shown to have limited effects for estimation in emerging epidemics [2] , but spatial effects [32] clearly play a role in disease spread, and their effect on parameter estimates is yet to be investigated. Changing behaviour probably kicks in early in emerging outbreaks of serious diseases like Ebola, and are hence also important to include in future inferential procedures for emerging epidemic outbreaks.",

Cumulative incidence of notified cases over time in log-scale. Black line represents expected slope (line with equation y \u00bc rx). It is seen that incidence grows exponentially (linear on log-scale) but that there is a random time-shift before the epidemic takes off in the different simulations. As explained in the electronic supplementary material, simulations were continued until 4500 cumulated cases (\u00bc3.65 in log-scale) and then for further six weeks or until week 36.
