Memorizing medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases likely maximized the chances of survival and reproduction and was instrumental in the evolutionary success of our species. In the present study, we used the idea of adaptive memory to understand whether human memory evolved to recall information about medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases. We considered plant-disease pairs of words as units of information available in a medical system based on the use of medicinal plants. The pairs included in the categories of chronic infectious diseases and transmissible infectious diseases were considered to be of higher adaptive value, whereas those included in the category of common conditions were considered to be of lower adaptive value. Pairs grouped into the category of emerging and reemerging diseases were employed to investigate conformity bias; pairs belonging to the category esthetic uses were considered to be of little adaptive relevance and utilized as an experimental control. Our results revealed that plant-disease pairs associated with the category of common conditions, considered by us to be of lower severity and less adaptive relevance for humans, were better remembered and retained in the participants' memory. We believe that prior experience with common conditions and the frequency of these conditions in the population may have intensified the ability to remember the plant-disease pairs associated with this group of diseases.

            "text": "In response to the adversities faced by our ancestors, humans have better developed mechanisms to learn and retain information related to survival and reproduction than information that is not relevant to our fitness [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . PLOS From this perspective, the term adaptive memory was proposed by Nairne, Thompson and Pandeirada [1] to describe the differential performance of the human mind in a survival situation. For example, in one of their experiments, these authors presented students with three distinct scenarios: survival, moving and pleasantness. In the first scenario-survival-participants had to imagine themselves in a foreign land without basic subsistence supplies such as water and food and with the need to avoid predators. In this condition, participants were shown a list of words and asked to assess which of them would be relevant or irrelevant in dealing with the survival condition. In the second condition-moving, which was not related to the survival condition-participants had to imagine that they were moving to a new home in a foreign land, and they were instructed to assess the relevance of each presented word for locating and buying a house and carrying their belongings. In the third condition-pleasantness, which was used by the authors as a deep memory processing control-participants were shown a list of words and instructed to rate the pleasantness of each word. Some words could be pleasant, and others could not. The authors used Likert scales for all conditions. The results of the study showed that after the evaluation and/or classification of the words, followed by a revelation recall test, there was a greater retention of words relevant for the survival condition than of words relevant for the other conditions. Aslam and Bauml [6] and Yang, Lau and Truong [8] replicated the results obtained by Nairne, Thompson and Pandeirada [1] , and experiments using other stimuli, such as images and graphs, instead of words obtained similar results [11-12-13] . The same memory mechanisms that favor adaptive information have also been observed in people of different age groups and environmental contexts [14] [15] [16] [17] . Studies have also revealed that people better remember animate stimuli (e.g., baby and lion) than inanimate stimuli (e.g., table and mountain) [18-19-20] . These findings reinforce the adaptive role of memory, as better recall of animated stimuli may have enabled our ancestors to avoid predators and potential enemies, as well as to identify partners and locate food, increasing the chances of survival and reproduction.",

In one of their experiments, these authors showed the participants pictures of everyday objects along with a description of the health condition of the person who touched the object. The description presented was associated with a sick or healthy person. Participants were asked to assess whether one of the types of people touched the object. Subsequently, the authors performed an unanticipated recall test in which participants had to recall the names of the objects presented. As predicted by Fernandes et al. [13] , participants better remembered the names of objects that were described as having been touched by sick people-a source of potential contamination-than the objects that were described as having been touched by healthy people. Bonin et al. [21] replicated the findings of Fernandes et al. [13] . In their first experiment, these authors presented three scenarios to the participants. The first two scenarios related to the context of contamination, avoidance of a potentially infectious disease, where the first scenario represented an ancestral environmental context and the second scenario represented a modern environmental context. The third scenario represented a control situation, in which participants imagined that they were organizing a trip for a group of people as their tour guide. After assessing which words would be relevant or irrelevant for dealing with each situation, participants faced a distraction task, followed by a surprise recall test in which they were instructed to write the words that they remembered. The authors observed no difference in recall regarding words involving contamination conditions both in ancestral environments and in modern environments. However, the two scenarios did differ significantly from the control condition in terms of recall. This evidence suggests that human memory may be equipped to recall adaptive information to avoid and prevent diseases.",

These authors studied the memorization of words in different adaptive scenarios-survival, fear and phobia, partner selection, avoidance of incest, detection of cheaters, jealousy, infidelity and gaining or maintaining status-and observed that remembrance of words for the survival scenario surpassed that of other information also considered adaptive. The authors then explained that memory is hierarchical because it prioritizes certain adaptive information to the detriment of other information.

It is possible that previous experiences with a disease and its frequency in the population shape how we prioritize and retain information. Therefore, human memory appears to be flexible in recalling adaptive information associated with medical practices involving plants, which is in contrast to our hypothesis that there is a priority for serious illnesses.",

Although this limitation did not affect the interpretation of our findings that some pairs of words were better recalled than others, this variable should be controlled for in further studies. The use of esthetics as an experimental control may have led to bias because esthetic problems can affect health and psychological comfort. Thus, we suggest in future studies the use of an experimental control that allows greater neutrality. ",
