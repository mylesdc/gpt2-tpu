Decisions surrounding how to control an infectious disease outbreak currently rely on a subjective process involving surveillance and expert opinion. However, there are many situations where neither may be available. Modeling can fill gaps in the decision making process by using available data to provide quantitative estimates of outbreak trajectories. Effective reduction of the spread of infectious diseases can be achieved through collaboration between the modeling community and public health policy community. However, such collaboration is rare, resulting in a lack of models that meet the needs of the public health community.",

The most common variant is the SIR model, named after the categories used-\"susceptible\", \"infectious\" and \"recovered\". Models of this nature have small computational requirements, and are thus commonly used as first pass attempts to characterize outbreaks or infections quickly 5 . For example, after the sudden emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s, researchers used modeling to characterize the virus' epidemiology. Several used compartmental models with control measures like quarantine or isolation in various settings (e.g., hospitals or cities) to describe effects of possible interventions 6-9 . Similar work exists for essentially all well known infectious diseases. For example, Mandal et al. provide a review of models used for malaria 10 and Bauch et al. explore model use with respect to SARS and other emerging infectious diseases 6 .

The counterfactual concept is not generally explicitly applied to epidemiological modeling, but some (e.g., Smith et al. 19 ) mention the concept of exploring what \"could\" happen under different control scenarios. A policy maker could, for example, mentally compare an outbreak of strep throat where hand washing is the predominant intervention to an identical one where school closures are the main intervention and compare outbreak outcomes to aid in decision support about which intervention to use.

The infectious period is the interval of time during which an infected individual can transmit the disease. Time in our model is represented in days. Measles, for example, has an infectious period of approximately 8 days; individuals can transmit the disease from approximately 4 days before rash onset until 4 days after 21 . \u03b3 controls the transition from infectious to recovered (see equations (2) and (3)). \u03b2 is commonly referred to as the \"force of infection\" because it describes how quickly a disease can move through a population. It is the product of \u03b3 and the reproductive number (R 0 ), and controls the transition from susceptible to infectious (see equations (1) and (2)). The reproductive number, R 0 , is the number of secondary infections per primary infection (see equation (4)). Of note, R 0 can be estimated a number of ways.

This would describe an intervention like vaccination or quarantine. However, it does not describe the type of control measure that reduces infectivity, changes human behavior in a way that affects population density (e.g., staying home from work/school), or does not confer immunity to the infection (e.g., hand washing). Further, the control measure is continuously applied at each time point after initiation (e.g., 10% of the susceptible population are vaccinated each day for the remainder of the outbreak). This assumes that the control is implemented with the same effectiveness throughout each time interval. These assumptions simplify the addition of control measures to the SIR model, but it is relatively straightforward to modify this implementation in the future to a more realistic scenario.

Within a given cross-section of outbreak parameters, the \u03c4 value (control measure start) affects the resulting \u03ba more than \u03bb indicating that, under this model, implementing a control measure early is more important than implementing the most effective control measure. This is a potentially important finding for decision support and is an intriguing path for further investigation. It is also consistent with our sensitivity analysis findings (see Fig. 2 ). For each disease, we identify the latest possible control start and the least effective intervention that could still result in \u03ba values of 0.1 and 0.01 (see Table 3 ). Interestingly, if control measures have \u03bbs that are large enough (minimum 5%), or control starts that are early enough (6-30 days) they can consistently produce dramatic reductions in outbreak load. By examining these values in various parameter ranges, we can begin to see the effects of parameter ranges on \u03ba results. In Table 3 , we consider (1) the entire range, (2) the lower 50th percentile shows a parameter (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bb, R 0 or \u03c4) with respect to outbreak size, represented here by the cumulative number of infected individuals in a controlled or uncontrolled outbreak.

However the use of SIR models necessitates adoption of several assumptions that rarely exist in real world outbreaks. Of particular concern is the assumption of homogenous mixing. However, there are numerous ways to improve upon the simple model described here. Other compartmental models (e.g., SEIR, SIS, SI etc.) and methods exist to reduce or modify these assumptions and expand the breadth of applicable disease. For example, Hethcote et al. describe a method to allow non-homogenous mixing within compartmental models for sexually transmitted infections 29 .",

For example, Meyers et al. 30 found that coupling a compartmental model with an underlying social network allowed them to explain aspects of real SARS epidemics (used for illustration purposes in the introduction) better, than the compartmental models alone. Related possibilities include additions of spatial networks in addition to or instead of social networks 31 . It is possible that various networks are suited to particular diseases or disease scenarios. These subtleties offer opportunities for extensive further research. Importantly, many variations of these models continue to maintain comparatively low computational requirements, while allowing for a better representation of reality.",

In contrast, Wearing et al. estimate parameters by finding the best simulated outbreak fit to real data and identifying the parameters that give rise to that simulation 32 . Their results caution that model selection (e.g., the type of compartmental model used) can dramatically affect the resulting reproductive ratio estimated. Our results indicate that, in addition, variations in reproductive ratio produce exceedingly different outbreaks. Meyers et al. 30 also note the large impact parameter selection and network structure can have on resulting simulated outbreaks.",

While SIR models have been used extensively for many years, there has been little work done on validating their output. We thus propose thoughtful validation of SIR models as an important next step. One method to accomplish this is to compare the outputs of validated agent-based models to outbreaks produced using compartmental models. Previously validated agent-based models simulating disease outbreak progression on a fine tuned scale already exist (e.g., EpiSimS 33, 34 ) and would provide good candidates for this research.",
