            "text": "Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new, emerging viruses. These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses.",

            "text": "The emergence of new viruses is a constant challenge to the wellbeing of the human race and its food supply. New viruses or viral strains are produced from existing forms as a consequence of two processes: mutation and recombination or reassortment, which occur in both plant and animal hosts [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The potential for recombination and reassortment is greatly enhanced in persistent and chronic infections, in which multiple genotypes of a single viral species, or multiple viral species, are introduced into a single host through repeated infections [7, 8] . Co-replicating viral genotypes create an environment conducive for RNA recombination to generate potentially new combinations of genes or protein domains that are exponential to the number of genotypes in the mixed infection. These recombinants may evolve subsequently into new and emerging viruses [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, the extent to which such long-term infections result in genotypic variants remains largely unexplored.",

CTV is a member of the genus Closterovirus within the family Closteroviridae [9] [10] [11] [12] , and is the most important and destructive virus of citrus [13, 14] . CTV virions are flexuous rods, 2000 nm in length and 12 nm in diameter, consisting of one single-stranded, (+)-sense RNA genome encapsidated by two species of coat proteins (97% CP and 3% CPm) [15] . The 19.2 to 19.3 kb genome contains 12 open reading frames, is the largest of the plant RNA viruses, and is one of the largest of all RNA viruses [9] [10] [11] [16] [17] [18] . The 59 half of the genome (,nt. 1-11,000) encodes proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, methyltransferase, and proteases) that are required for viral replication [19] and are thought to be translated directly from the genomic RNA. The 39 half encodes proteins which are thought to interact with host plants [20] [21] [22] and are expressed from ten 39 co-terminal subgenomic RNAs [23, 24] .",

Often in natural infections in the field, CTV exists as a complex comprising multiple strains or genotypes, due to the longevity of individual citrus trees and the extensive use of vegetative propagation of budwood. Continual vertical transmission coupled with repeated horizontal transmission mediated by aphids throughout the history of citrus cultivation has led to the complexity of the CTV population increasing over hundreds of years, resulting in the co-existence of multiple CTV genotypes in a single host [8, 26, 27] . The presence within a host of multiple replicating CTV genotypes and the relatively long periods of coreplication create opportunities for recombination between the genotypes, leading to extensive viral diversity. In this report, we characterized a persistent infection by multiple CTV genotypes by genome-wide microarray resequencing analysis and deep sequencing analysis of selected genomic regions. Our results demonstrate an extraordinary amount of viral variability generated by promiscuous recombination between multiple genotypes, and provide evidence for subsequent divergence of the recombinants within a single host plant.",

Sequences tiled on the microarray include full-length sequences of four CTV type strains, T3 (Hilf, unpublished) , T30 [9] , T36 [10] , and VT [11] , three-quarters of the strain T68-1 genome (Hilf, unpublished) , as well as unique genomic sequences identified from five other CTV isolates [28] . Together, over 117 kb of CTV sequences representing a genetic diversity equivalent to ten full-length CTV genomes (Table 1) were tiled on the resequencing microarray. Using known CTV isolates as the source for target cDNAs, the CTV resequencing microarray yielded call rates of ,99.7-99.8% and call accuracies of ,99.9-100% [28] , performing comparably to, or better than, several reported resequencing microarrays [29, 30] .",

The isolate was initially suspected to possess multiple CTV genotypes on the basis of PCR-amplification with genotypespecific primers (data not shown). The multiple CTV genomes present in FS2-2 were amplified in their entirety by long-range RT-PCR with a high fidelity polymerase from total RNA prepared from infected tissues, using four sets of universal CTV primers (Table 2) capable of amplifying all known CTV genomes. DNA fragments of expected sizes were amplified from the total RNA extracted from FS2-2-infected tissues (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, each of the three unique 59 end PCR primers, designed specifically for CTV genomes with very different 59 terminal sequences, successfully amplified DNA fragments of the predicted sizes in RT-PCR ( Fig. 1) , indicating the presence of multiple genotypes in the FS2-2 CTV complex. The three 59 DNA fragments and the three DNA fragments amplified from the remaining portion of the CTV genomes were pooled proportionally, and then were processed for microarray hybridization [28] .",

These fragments and the quality scores associated with each base call were used in contig assembly by the Phrap program [32] as implemented in the CodonCode Aligner program. Three consensus contigs of complete CTV genomes (fs2_2_vt, fs2_2_t30, and fs2_2_t36), corresponding to the three visually identified CTV genotypes, were assembled ( Fig. 3a ). In addition, two partial consensus contigs were also assembled (fs2_2_t3 and fs2_2_t68). Both were placed as intermediates between fs2_2_vt and fs2_2_t30 by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [33] (Fig. 3a) , and therefore might represent minor components of the CTV complex or variants generated by recombination between the major genotypes.",

The 59 terminal region was targeted because of its unusually high sequence variability in the CTV genomes. Previous comparative sequence analysis revealed an interesting and unusual distribution of sequence variation across the CTV genome [11, 12, 16, 34] . The 39 halves of the CTV genomes were highly conserved, with sequence identity being at or above 90%, as would be expected of strains of the same virus. However, sequences of the 59 halves were much more divergent, with pairwise comparisons yielding sequence identities of 70% or less for some isolates. Sequence identities as low as 48% was observed at the 59 untranslated regions (UTRs) [9, 35] . The 59 half of the CTV genome encodes a polyprotein that contains motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, methyltransferases, and proteases, and is required for viral replication [19] . Generally speaking, viral proteins required for replication are highly conserved within viral species and genera, and occasionally this conservation may extend across an entire family of viruses.",

RT-PCR amplification of the fragment was accomplished using a combination of three 59 end primers and a universal, 39 primer ( Table 2 ) that were designed for the amplification of all known CTV sequences at the 59 end. A total of 70 clones were randomly selected and sequenced using an ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer. Among the clones sequenced in this manner, 15 contained sequences nearly identical (98.7,99.8% identity) to the reported T36 sequence [10] . Sequences of 20 clones were nearly identical (99.3,99.6% identity) to the published T30 sequence [9] , while another 34 clones produced sequences highly similar (97.6,97.9% identity) to that of VT [11] . These results unequivocally identified three CTV genotypes in the FS2-2 complex that corresponded to the three major genotypes revealed by the resequencing microarray. Within each of the T30- like and the VT-like genotypes, the clones were nearly homogeneous, with a sequence identity of 99.3,100%. However, sequences within the T36-like genotype were found to be slightly more diverse, with a sequence identity ranging from 98.6% to 100%, suggesting that this genotype might have evolved faster and started to diversify within the population. Indeed, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed that three sequences (fs22_78, fs22_79, and fs22_83) of the T36-like genotype emerged as a distinguishable subclade within the T36-like clade (Fig. 3b) .",

Therefore, fs22_28 likely represented one of the minor genotypes identified in the resequencing analysis. Further analysis revealed fs22-28 to be recombinant: its 59 region comprised 282 nucleotides identical to the sequences of 7 independently sequenced clones from the T30-like genotype, and its 39 region consisted of 574 nucleotides identical to sequences in 22 sequenced clones of the VT-like genotype. The recombination crossover site in fs22_28 comprised 41 nucleotides identical to sequences within both parental genotypes. Although the recombinant clone represents one of the minor genotypes detected by the resequencing microarray, direct cloning and sequencing of the 59 1 kb of the CTV genomes in the FS2-2 complex failed to identify all the minor genotypes.",

Sequencing data from the 983 nucleotides of these clones (Fig. 3c) provided a detailed portrait of the CTV complex, and of on-going, promiscuous recombination among various major CTV genotypes. Among the sequenced clones, the three major genotypes again were well represented with 51 VT-like clones, twelve T30like clones, and six T36-like clones. Several groups of clones shared identical sequences (groups of nine, seven, five, five, two, two, and two clones for the VT-like genotype; and groups of two and two clones for the T30-like genotype) while all T36-like clones had unique sequences. These confirmed that the VT-like genotypes were more homogeneous and the T36-like genotypes were more divergent in FS2-2, an observation arising earlier from analysis of the 59 terminal CTV fragments. The large number of identical sequences obtained from these clones, as well as from clones derived from the 59 1 kb region, also demonstrated that the RT-PCR employed in this study maintained a high fidelity during viral sequence amplification and that errors introduced during RT-PCR were negligible.",

Further, four recombinants contained two crossovers, resulting from either a double-crossover or two independent recombination events. The parental sequences for each recombinant were readily identified among the three major genotypes. The crossover sites appeared throughout the p33 ORF without an apparent recombination hotspot. One common feature of these recombinants was that recombination crossover sites contained a stretch of sequence that was identical in both parental molecules. The identical sequences at the crossover sites varied in length, ranging from as short as 3 nucleotides to as long as 25 nucleotides. This feature of shared parental sequences suggested that the recombinants were most likely formed by a templateswitching event during viral RNA replication [37] [38] [39] . Some of the crossover sites were characteristic of classical recombination hotspots with a stretch of AU-rich sequence that promotes dissociation and switching of RNA polymerase from one template to another [40, 41] .

The DNA fragments amplified from this artificial mixture were cloned, and 75 random clones were sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that 26 clones were derived from the T36-like genotype and 49 were derived from the VT genotype. More importantly, none of the 75 sequenced clones was recombinant between the two genotypes present in the template DNA. This result strongly suggests that the extraordinarily large number of recombinant viral molecules detected in the FS2-2 CTV complex represent natural recombinants.

This was particularly evident in two pairs of recombinants (Fig. 4) . The first pair (fs22-05 and fs22-36) contained an identical recombination crossover site but four divergent nucleotides located both 59 and 39 of the crossover site. A plausible explanation is that they originated from a single recombination event and that progenies of the recombinant diverged subsequently. The second pair of recombinants (fs22-15 and fs22-100) contained an identical crossover site at the 59 end, but fs22-15 possessed an additional crossover site toward the 39 end. One probable explanation is that both were the progeny of a single recombination event at the 59 end with fs22-15 subsequently undergoing a further round of recombination. In the identical region of the two recombinants, three divergent nucleotides were found spanning the 59 crossover site, indicating that the regions had diverged after the first recombination event. These data suggest an event line of recombination, divergence, and further recombination, leading to a distinct CTV genotype. This scenario also explains the chimeric nature of the sequenced SY568 CTV genome [12] as a consequence of recombination between two CTV genotypes [8] .",

However, most of these applications either targeted viruses with relatively little sequence variability, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [29] , or only selected regions of viruses having larger sequence variability [43] [44] [45] . With increased tiling capacity, the Affymetrix resequencing microarrays can now be used to simultaneously detect divergent viruses, as we have demonstrated in our work, where three major genotypes and additional minor genotypes of CTV were successfully identified from isolate FS2-2 by resequencing analysis. The three major CTV genotypes investigated by the resequencing analysis were quite divergent with genome-wide nucleotide differences of 11% between the VT-and the T30-like genotypes, 20% between the VT-and the T36-like genotypes, and 19% between the T30-and the T36-like genotypes. Successful resequencing analysis of these divergent CTV genomes with a single resequencing microarray chip is largely attributed to the tiling strategy of selecting representative full-length CTV genomes guided by phylogenetic analysis and of selecting unique sequences identified by pair-wise comparisons from other CTV genomes. This strategy allows the CTV resequencing microarray with a tiling capacity of 117 kb to encompass a sequence diversity equivalent to ten full-length CTV genomes. With its ability to query concurrently entire genomes of multiple CTV genotypes as demonstrated in this work, the CTV resequencing microarray will find many uses in future CTV studies.",

However, the extraordinarily large proportion of recombinant viral molecules as a consequence of promiscuous recombination in the FS2-2 isolate was surprising. We found that 17.6% of cloned and sequenced molecules from the p33 ORF were recombinants derived from the three predominant genotypes in the FS2-2 complex. In contrast, a previous study of another CTV complex, SY568, identified less than 4% of the cloned molecules as being recombinants between two genotypes [8] . It is not clear whether the large proportion of recombinants in FS2-2 is a consequence of an elevated recombination rate in the presence of more than two genotypes or a result of recombinants accumulating over time. Likely though, as a result of current horticultural practices, the sweet orange tree from which FS2-2 was derived was planted free of CTV and the CTV population is a result of ingress of the T30, T36 and VT genotypes by aphid transmission, followed by recombination to produce the recombinants found in this study. Subsequent transmission of the FS2-2 complex by aphids or by vegetative propagation to a similar or a new host may perpetuate the same complexity or alter it by generating new and additional recombinant genotypes.",

This difference perhaps can explain the unusual distribution of sequence variability in the CTV genome, with the 59 half being more variable and the 39 half being less variable.",

            "text": "Recombination in RNA viruses has been extensively documented [1, 4] as a powerful driving force for generating new sequences which appear as emerging viruses, since recombination can rapidly generate new genotypes by swapping genes or protein domains to reconstitute proteins with novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits [5, 6] . The unprecedented scope of recombination between multiple CTV genotypes within a single, persistently infected host as revealed in this study further underscores the importance of recombination in RNA virus evolution, and may explain the extraordinary diversity observed in CTV today. The large number of genetic variants generated through recombination can potentially evolve on their own and become an emerging viral isolate when, and if transmitted to a new host or into a new environment. The influenza virus responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was hypothesized to have acquired, through recombination, a portion of the hemagglutinin gene, a key virulence gene, from a swine-lineage influenza [5] . In this regard, it is interesting to note that all but one of the recombinants in this study maintained the correct open reading frames, and consequently generating a functional recombinant protein. Further studies are needed to determine the viability of these CTV recombinants in isolation from the parental sequences and to evaluate the likelihood that any of the recombinants will emerge as a new CTV strain. CTV shares similarities in its genome organization and gene expression strategies with the largest animal RNA viruses, corornaviruses (which includes the viral agent of SARS), so it is conceivable that similar processes may also operate in global populations of coronaviruses to generate genetic diversity.",
