            "text": "Specific cleavage of proteins by proteases is essential for several cellular, physiological, and viral processes. Chymotrypsin-related proteases that form the PA clan in the MEROPS classification of proteases is one of the largest and most diverse group of proteases. The PA clan comprises serine proteases from bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses and chymotrypsin-related cysteine proteases from positive-strand RNA viruses. Despite low amino acid sequence identity, all PA clan proteases share a conserved double \u03b2-barrel structure. Using an automated structure-based hierarchical clustering method, we identified a common structural core of 72 amino acid residues for 143 PA clan proteases that represent 12 protein families and 11 subfamilies. The identified core is located around the catalytic site between the two \u03b2-barrels and resembles the structures of the smallest PA clan proteases. We constructed a structure-based distance tree derived from the properties of the identified common core. Our structure-based analyses support the current classification of these proteases at the subfamily level and largely at the family level. Structural alignment and structure-based distance trees could thus be used for directing objective classification of PA clan proteases and to strengthen their higher order classification. Our results also indicate that the PA clan proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses are related to cellular heatshock proteases, which suggests that the exchange of protease genes between viruses and cells might have occurred more than once.

A lack of balance in the expression of certain proteases is also associated with cancer development [2, 4] , which emphasizes the importance of controlled protease activity for normal cellular function. PLOS Proteases vary in their structural folds and in the composition of the catalytic amino acids. MEROPS is a database and hierarchical classification scheme for proteases [5, 6] . Families in MEROPS are defined as groups of homologous proteins that share significant similarity in amino acid sequence with the peptidase unit of the type example of the family or another protein previously assigned to the family. Families are assigned into a clan if representative family members have clearly similar protein folds. Members of a clan are assumed to share a common origin. If there are clearly distinct groups of proteases within a family and there is evidence of very ancient divergence, the members of a family are divided into subfamilies. One of the most studied protease groups is the chymotrypsin-related proteases that constitute the PA clan in the MEROPS database. The PA clan currently contains nine families of cysteine proteases (representing proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses) and 14 families of serine proteases (representing proteolytic enzymes from eukaryotes, bacteria, some DNA viruses and eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses). The cysteine protease family C3 is further divided into eight subfamilies (C3A-C3H); the serine protease families S1 and S39 are divided into six (S1A-S1F) and two (S39A and S39B) subfamilies, respectively.",

Most of the protein structures are from the S1A subfamily [5, 6] , which is also the largest subfamily and includes members from bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses. The genes encoding the members of the S1A subfamily are extensively duplicated in eukaryotic genomes and have evolved into multiple protease types with diverse functions [8] . Another important group is the viral proteases, which are currently distributed into 20 families within the PA clan. Viral proteases are essential for the cleavage of RNA virus polyproteins (Table 1 ) [9] , but may also enhance the production of viral proteins and inhibit innate host defense mechanisms via cleavage of host translation factors, such as PABP, eIF4G, or eIF5B, as demonstrated for enteroviral 3C and 2A proteases [10] [11] [12] . These proteins are expressed during the viral life cycle but are not typically incorporated into the virion (i.e. they are non-structural proteins). Furthermore, the S1C subfamily (also known as the HtrA family) includes heat-shock proteases activated in response to various stress reactions and is a prominent group among the PA clan proteases. These proteases are present in all the three domains of life and function in multiple roles, such as chaperones and in processes such as protein quality control and stress signaling [13] . Dysfunction of these proteases is associated with diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease [14] .",

HSF identifies the equivalent residues for a pair of protein structures by comparing a set of amino acid properties (e.g. physiochemical properties of amino acids, local geometry, backbone direction, local alignment, and C\u03b1 distances) [17] . The two protein structures that are the most similar based on the properties are merged into a common structural core which then represents the pair in the later iterations. The iteration is continued until all the protein structures are part of a clustering and a single structural core is identified for all the proteins in the data set. The equivalent residues in the structural core can be considered homologous, similar to high-scoring columns of multiple sequence alignment. A pairwise comparison of the properties of the residues in the homologous positions of the common structural core between the original structures results in a pairwise distance matrix, which can be used for constructing a structure-based distance tree [17] . The distances in such structure-based distance trees do not necessarily reflect exact evolutionary distances, as changes in protein structure may not be continuous. However, the clustering of proteins in the structure-based distance tree constructed using HSF has been shown to follow the sequencebased classification of proteins into protein families, even when the common core contains less than 40 residues [18, 19] . Thus, structure-based analysis is appropriate for a rough estimation of evolutionary events and relationships between protein families when the proteins share little or no detectable sequence similarity.",

Here, we describe a common structural core of 72 residues for proteases, representing 12 different families of the clan. We then derived a structure-based distance tree based on the identified core. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to comprehensively study the relationships of the PA clan protease families. The structure-based distance tree precisely follows the established protease subfamilies, although the core does not contain any unique subfamily-specific features. Notably, this structure-based distance tree more precisely follows the MEROPS classification than the sequence-based phylogeny deduced for the same set of proteases. Structure-based distance analyses could thus be used to complement sequence-based methods in the systematic classification of proteins, particularly when sequence similarity is minimal and the alignment region is short. Moreover, our results support the earlier conclusions that the PA clan proteases of RNA viruses are related to the cellular heat-shock proteases of subfamily S1C (i.e. HtRA proteases) [15, 21] . In addition, our results indicate that the exchange of protease genes between viruses and cellular organisms may have occurred more than once.",

These structures were subsequently used for DALI searches [22] (ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server) to enlarge the data set. To assure that the chosen protein structures were large enough to contain both \u03b2-barrels, only protein structures containing \ufffd138 amino acids were used for further analysis. The resulting dataset was filtered such that amino acid sequences of the protein structures represented pairwise sequence identity of 70% at maximum. Filtering was performed by using CD-hit [23, 24] . The protein structures of the resulting dataset were manually verified and some structures were replaced if a higher quality protein structure was available. The criteria for replacing a protein structure were: 1) a more complete structure in the catalytic region, 2) fewer amino acid substitutions, and 3) higher resolution. In addition, the structures of the S6 protease family (see S1 Table) were cut such that only the serine protease domain remained; this prevented the other domains from interfering in the structure alignment.",

This filtering was performed as highly similar structures would not provide additional information about the relationships between families and subfamilies but would notably increase the computation time. After filtering, the data set was further manually curated. Structures were removed if they lacked a complete catalytic site with two \u03b2-barrel-like domains; there were more than 10 missing residues per structure; or the resolution of the protein structure was >4.0\u00c5. Some initially selected protein structures were also replaced if a higher-quality protein structure (according to criteria above) was available in the original cluster of 70% sequence identity (see Materials and Methods). The minimum and median amino acid sequence identity values between pairs of selected proteases were 0.1% and 15.0%, respectively (using Smith-Waterman algorithm [34] ).",

The catalytic amino acids are located in the third and sixth \u03b2-strands of the Nterminal \u03b2-barrel (His and Asp/Glu, respectively) and in the fourth \u03b2-strand of the C-terminal \u03b2-barrel (Ser or Cys) (see Fig 3) . In addition to the catalytic amino acids, the surrounding residues participate in stabilization of the triad via H bonds [42] . Calculation of interaction energies for the identified core region and regions outside of the core from a representative structure of each protease family/subfamily included in this study revealed that the core region in all of the selected proteases has a lower average interaction energy between its residues than the rest of the structure. The calculated average interaction energies within the core were approximately 2.7 times lower than the calculated average interaction energies of the other regions of the protein. This indicates that the core residues are important for stabilizing and maintaining the overall structure of the protein (S3 Table) . The extensions and loops between the \u03b2-strands of the N-and C-terminal \u03b2-barrels are not shared by all the members of the PA clan and are thus not present in the identified core structure. This extension and these loops are typically required for more specific functions of the protease, such as recognition and binding of ligands (e.g. exosite I of thrombin binds a cofactor [43] ). Thus, the identified structurally conserved core likely represents the minimum structure to perform the catalytic reaction, while the regions outside the core are adaptations to the specific environment and function of the protease.",

A structure-based distance tree was calculated based on the 72 residues forming the common structural core of the PA clan proteases.

The robustness of this clustering was tested with a simplified jackknife test suitable for structure-based distance trees [19] . In this test, a member from each subfamily/family is discarded one at a time and a new structure-based distance tree is repeatedly calculated using the remaining dataset (here 142 structures; S1 Fig) . This analysis confirmed that the outline of the structure-based distance tree presented in Fig 4 is robust at the group and MEROPS subfamily levels (compare Fig 4 to  S1 Fig) . The only exceptions are the viral proteases of subfamily S32, which clustered in 15% of replicates with group IV and in 85% of replicates with group V. Interestingly, the members of the S32 subfamily also received the highest scores in the initial DALI searches with the members of either groups IV or V (S4 Table) .",

The clustering of PA proteases in the structure-based distance tree was based on the identified common structural core, which does not cover regions previously considered characteristic for each subfamily [44] . Nevertheless, the obtained clustering follows the MEROPS classification at the subfamily level (Fig 4) . The only exception is the subfamily S1D, which is split into two groups. This division was also maintained in the simplified jackknife test (see S1 Fig) , suggesting that division of subfamily S1D into two separate subfamilies could be considered. Here, we have used subfamily names \"S1D type \" and \"S1D new \" to indicate these two groups (Fig 4) . The first one includes Achromobacter protease I (PDBid: 1ARB) and the type example of the current S1D subfamily lysyl endopeptidase of Lysobacter enzymogenes (PDBid: 4NSY). The second (S1D new ) contains the thermostable serine protease AL20 of Nesterenkonia abyssinica (PDBid: 3CP7) and the Anisep protease from Arthrobacter nicotovorans (PDBid: 3WY8). The S1D type group is clustered with the S1B and S1C subfamilies and this clustering is also maintained in all the replicates of the simplified jackknife test (S1 Fig). The S1D new group clusters with members of the protease subfamily S1E, and this clustering was observed in 75% of the replicate runs (see S1 Fig) . DALI results also support the division of S1D into two subgroups; members of both subgroups received the best hits within the new subgroups. However, the Z-score similarities, rmsd values, and sequence identities between members of different subgroups were comparable to those obtained when S1D proteases were compared to the other subfamilies of the S1 family (DALI search on 15 April 2018). The proteases in the identified S1D type and S1D new are from distantly related bacterial phyla, namely Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, respectively. The distinct evolutionary history of these bacteria could at least partially explain the observed structural diversification of the S1D proteases into two groups.",

In group V, the representative structure of the S1F subfamily (Astrovirus serine peptidase) is grouped together with members of subfamily S32 within a large cluster of other cysteine and serine proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses (Fig 4 and S1 Fig) . Furthermore, the S6 family forms an independent group II. This group is located between groups I and III that both contain only members of the S1 family. The members of S6 family are autotransporter proteins in gram-negative bacteria; all the members of S6 family proteases have a long \u03b2-stalk structure at the C-terminus, which was not found from any other PA clan proteases [47] . Despite the large additional domain and the low sequence identity, the S6 serine protease domain structurally resembles members of the S1A subfamily the most [47] , thus supporting the location of the S6 branch within the S1 subfamilies.

Within the structure-based distance tree (Fig 4) , all the cysteine and serine proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses except that of sobemovirus serine protease (subfamily S39A) were clustered together (group V) apart from all cellular proteases. The high mutation rates of RNA viruses compared to cellular organisms can deteriorate the detectable signal of sequence similarity between homologous cellular and viral proteins, thus making it difficult to trace their relationships. However, in our structure-based analyses, group V of viral PA clan proteases was always located in close proximity to the group IV proteases (Fig 4 and S1 Fig), indicating a common origin for these two groups of proteases. Group IV contains eukaryotic and bacterial HtrA proteases of subfamily S1C and bacterial serine proteases of subfamilies S1B and S46 and the S1D type group (such as dipeptidyl-peptidases, lysyl endopeptidase, glutamyl endopeptidase I, and SplA peptidase). Exchanges of protease genes between eukaryotic viruses and their hosts likely explains the observed structural relatedness of the abundant eukaryotic HtrA proteases (belonging to the S1C subfamily) and the viral proteases of group V. However, intracellular bacteria of eukaryotic cells (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis) also have HtrA protease genes, thus offering an alternate gene transfer route for PA proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses and HtrA proteases [5, 6] . In the initial DALI searches for the viral PA clan proteases, the highest scoring cellular proteases in 9 cases out of 13 were among members of the subfamily S1C of group IV (S4 Table) . In addition, representatives of two viral protease subfamilies (C3B and S39A) achieved the best hits for cellular proteases outside the S1C group. Thus, the closest cellular relatives for the known viral PA proteases seem to be among the members of the S1C family. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies (based on amino acid sequence or structure-based comparisons), which indicated that viral 3C proteases might have evolved from the HtrA family [15, 21] . In addition, our results suggest that the lateral gene transfer between the cellular protease genes of group IV and the genomes of positive-strand RNA viruses has occurred more than once. This is demonstrated by the observation that the serine protease of sobemovirus in group IV (S39A subfamily) is located separately from all the other viral proteases clustered in the group V (see Fig 4) . In previous studies on viral proteases, the sobemovirus protease has also appeared to be only distantly related to the proteases of picornaviruses and secoviruses [15] .",

However, togavirin is not only a viral protease but also serves as the major capsid protein of the virus [48] . Previously, it was observed that togavirin is structurally similar to flavivirus protease NS3 (protease family S29). It was proposed that togavirin originates from a non-structural viral protease that replaced the coat protein in alphaviruses [48, 49] . Our results support the close relationship between these proteases. However, from our analyses it is impossible to deduce the direction of gene transfer between the different viruses. Nevertheless, the unique capsid protein function of togavirin among all the known PA clan proteases suggests that togavirin likely originates from the nonstructural proteases of flaviviruses.",

In this work, the identified core was substantially larger (>2\u00d7) and structurally less variable (average rmsd 2.2\u00c5 versus 3.6\u00c5) than in the previous study [19] . The better-defined core increased the accuracy of the method, demonstrated by the robustness of the constructed phylogenic tree (S1 Fig). The obtained higher order grouping of proteases (Fig 4) mainly followed the previously proposed protease subfamilies [5, 6] . The agreement between the MEROPS classification and our clustering analysis suggests that structural clustering could be used as an ancillary tool for objective classification of proteins when structural information is available for a representative set of proteins assigned to a clan.",
