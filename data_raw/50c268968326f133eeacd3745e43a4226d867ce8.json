Thus, many efforts are underway to develop the next generation of vaccines against other types of high-risk HPV. In this study, we developed DNA constructs (based on L1 and L2 genes) that were potentially immunogenic and highly conserved among the highrisk HPV types. The framework of analysis include (1) B-cell epitope mapping, (2) T-cell epitope mapping (i.e., CD4 + and CD8 + T cells), (3) allergenicity assessment, (4) tap transport and proteasomal cleavage, (5) population coverage, (6) global and template-based docking, and (7) data collection, analysis, and design of the L1 and L2 DNA constructs. Our data indicated the 8-epitope candidates for helper T-cell and CTL in L1 and L2 sequences. For the L1 and L2 constructs, combination of these peptides in a single universal vaccine could involve all world population by the rate of 95.55% and 96.33%, respectively. In vitro studies showed high expression rates of multiepitope L1 (~57.86%) and L2 (~68.42%) DNA constructs in HEK-293T cells. Moreover, in vivo studies indicated that the combination of L1 and L2 DNA constructs without any adjuvant or delivery system induced effective immune responses, and protected mice against C3 tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~66.67%). Thus, the designed L1 and L2 DNA constructs would represent promising applications for HPV vaccine development.",

            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and the main cause of cervical cancer. Globally, 4.5% of all cancers worldwide (60,000 cases per year in men and 570,000 cases per year in women) are attributable to HPV 1 . More than 150 viral types of HPV have been identified whose classification is based on their association with cervical cancer and precursor lesions. HPV types were classified as high-risk (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, and 54) types consistent with the generation of squamous cell carcinomas in the uterine cervix 2 . The papillomavirus double-stranded circular DNA genome encodes roughly eight open-reading frames (ORFs), which is responsible for viral replication, maintenance, and cell transformation. These gene products have been classified into six nonstructural regulatory proteins (E1-E6) and two structural capsid proteins (L1 and L2) 3 . Nowadays, the virus-like particles (VLPs) based on L1 proteins have been considered as the best candidate for vaccine development against HPV infections. Two commercial HPV vaccines are both prophylactic. Gardasil which protects against HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, and Cervarix which protects against HPV genotypes 16 and 18; Both of them prevent cervical cancer with almost 100% efficacy 4 . These HPV VLP vaccines confer protection against limited genotypes 5 . Although a variable level of cross-protection has also been observed against phylogenetically related HPV genotypes 6 , major impediments such as economic barriers especially gaps in financing obstructed the optimal delivery of vaccines in developing countries. This might be approached via locally produced generic vaccines. Storage and transportation, the so-called cold chain, is another hindrance, which should be mitigated through www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ lyophilization or protectants, and also it should be noted that many recombinant vaccines rely on multiple immunizations; however, promising results could be obtained with a single dose and certainly 2-dose regimens 7 .",

Indeed, the current HPV L2 vaccines improved a type-specific protection. Recent studies showed that some regions in the N-terminus of L2 can neutralize antibodies generated during various types of HPV infections 9 . To overcome the intrinsically low immunogenicity of the recombinant L2 protein, its potency could be increased by various formulations such as the multivalent L2 epitopes (peptide vaccine) 10-12 , fusion with L1 and other immunogenic proteins 13-15 and multiepitope DNA-based vaccines 16, 17 .",

In general, the results of three different algorithms confirmed each other. Conservancy and allergenicity analyses were done on the selected epitopes. The sequence of all the epitopes were well conserved among high-risk HPV types and none of them were allergens (Tables 4 and 5 ).

Since a suitable T-cell epitope should be predicted to bind to different HLA alleles, epitopes with the maximum number of binding HLA-DR alleles were selected as high-potential helper T-cell epitope candidates. Among predicted epitopes, L1 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] (EATVYLPPVPVSKVV-type 16) , L1 95-111 (TQRLVWACVGVEVGRGQ-type 16 and TQRLVWACAGVEIGRGQ-type 18), L1 416-430 (DTYRFVTSQAIACQK-type 16) , L1 417-431 (DTYRFVQSVAITCQK-type 18), L2 100-118 (DPSIVTLIEDSSVVTSGAP-type 16) , L2 281-297 (PDFLDIVALHRPALTSR-type 16) and L2 274-290 (SDFMDIIRLHRPALTSR-type 18) had the highest scores of binding affinity. Also, the sequence of all the epitopes were well conserved among high-risk HPV types and none of them were allergen (Tables 6 and 7) . Also, there was no cross-reactivity between peptide and human proteome. Population coverage analysis. HLA distribution varies among the diverse geographic regions around the world. Thus, while designing an effective vaccine, population coverage must be taken into consideration to cover the maximum possible populations. In this study, population coverage was estimated separately for each putative epitope in 16 specified geographic regions of the world (Tables 9 and 10) . For CTL epitopes, the highest population coverage of world's population was calculated for L1 12 a clear band of ~765 bp and ~700 bp on agarose gel for L1 and L2, respectively (data not shown). The recombinant endotoxin-free plasmids (i.e., pcDNA-L1 and pcDNA-L2) had a concentration range between 1.5 and 3.5 mg/mL.",

Unfortunately, a reliable method for prediction of B-cell epitope has not been revealed up to now and the sensitivity and specificity of existing methods were very low (the specificity and sensitivity of this method were 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). In the case of T-cell epitope prediction, in silico analysis has been significantly improved, thus, the results are more reliable. In this study, for MHC-I epitopes, L1 12-21 (YLPPVPVSKV-type16 and YLPPPSVARV-type18), L1 460-470 (DQFPLGRKFLL-type16), L1 461-471 (DQYPLGRKFLV-type18), L2 11-20 (KRASATQLYK-type16 and KRASVTDLYK-type18), L2 280-291 (DPDFLDIVALHR-type16) and L2 273-284 (DSDFMDIIRLHR-type18) epitopes had the highest binding affinity scores. In addition, above-mentioned epitopes had the highest T-cell epitope prediction scores which were obtained from proteasomal cleavage and tap transport analysis. High degree of conservancy was observed between subtypes for these epitopes ( [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] (FFGGLGIGTGSGTGGR-type16) epitopes had the highest binding affinity scores. Among them, L2 54-69 had the greatest degree of conservancy (high similarity with all of the high-risk HPV types). One of the remarkable points is that L1 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and L2 57-70 epitopes are the same (or overlapping with little difference (among B-cell and MHC-II selected epitopes. Due to a limitation of MHC-peptide binding prediction such as the gap between the peptides that are predicted to bind to MHC and those that experimentally bind 35 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ been employed to address this problem and raise the accuracy of MHC-peptide prediction. In the current study, template-based docking and also global docking were performed on the selected peptides to determine which peptide would get into the groove of MHC with the highest modeling scores. For MHC-I epitope, L1 12-21 , L1 460-470 and L2 280-291 sequences had the highest interaction similarity and cluster density scores. For MHC-II epitopes, L1 95-111 , L1 417-431 , L2 100-118 and L2 281-297 sequences had the highest docking scores. In this study, MHC-I-peptide docking scores confirmed MHC-I-peptide binding affinity scores because the same epitopes had the highest scores in both methods but in MHC-II molecular docking, the results were slightly different. One of the reasons is the significant conformational changes during the process due to the longer epitope length. As a general rule: the longer the length of the query peptide, the more torsions and conformational flexibilities 36 . Herein, due to longer peptide sequences, docking results in MHC-II were less accurate than MHC-I. For example, average similarity score in MHC-I was variable (171.8-259.7), but in MHC-II was 115.4-136. After the completion of the analysis and according to all of the above-mentioned parameters, two separate constructs were designed. In addition, accumulative population coverage of helper T-cell and CTL epitopes for the designed constructs www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ were estimated. For the L1 and L2 constructs, the combination of 8 epitope candidates for helper T-cell and CTL in a single universal vaccine could involve all world population by the rate of 95.55% and 96.33%, respectively (Fig. 3) . In previous studies, YLPPVPVSKV (HPV16 L1) 37 and KRASVTDLYK (HPV18 L2) 21 have been reported as potentially immunogenic epitopes. The ability of in vitro expression of the designed L1 and L2 DNA constructs was determined in HEK-293T cells using flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The transfection efficiency of the L1 and L2 DNA constructs was ~57.86% and ~68.42%, respectively indicating their high potency for delivery into the eukaryotic cells. As known, the use of a polytope DNA vaccine containing multiple T-cell and B-cell epitopes is an attractive strategy for developing a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine against HPV infections. After in vitro assay, immunological experiments were performed in mice to determine the efficiency of the designed L1 and L2 DNA constructs without the use of adjuvant or delivery system for vaccine development. Similarly, some studies used the pcDNA vector harboring the gene of interest for immunization without any adjuvant 38, 39 . Our data indicated that the groups immunized with L1, L2 and L1 + L2 DNA constructs increased antibody and T-cell responses as compared to control groups. Furthermore, the (L1 + L2)-specific immunity in mice receiving the mixture of L1 + L2 DNA constructs (G3) resulted in higher secretion of total IgG, IgG2a, IgG2b, IFN-\u03b3, IL-5 and IL-10 cytokines as well as Granzyme B than other groups. The higher levels of IgG2a and IgG2b as well as IFN-gamma (as a Th1 cytokine) in this group drive T-cell responses toward Th1-type immunity. The studies showed that immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) is related to a Th2-type response, while a Th1 response is associated with the induction of IgG2a and IgG2b in mice 40 . Regarding to our observations in protective studies, this regimen (L1 + L2 DNA construct: G3) could confer further protection against C3 tumor-challenged mice (survival rate: ~66.67%) depending on stimulation of CD4 + T cell-dominated Th1 responses as well as Granzyme B secretion (indicating CTL activity) as compared to the L1 or L2 DNA constructs, alone (survival rate: ~33.33%). These data showed high potency of the combined L1 + L2 DNA constructs versus each DNA construct alone as a prophylactic HPV vaccine. Taken together, immunoinformatics approaches have been emerged as a critical field for accelerating immunological researches. Yet, the immunoinformatics techniques applied to T-cells have more advancement than those dealing with B-cells 30 . Moreover, recently, due to the limited options for choosing an adjuvant in clinical trials, bioinformatics analyses have been developed to predict the best adjuvant. In this way, in silico studies help researchers saving time and resources, and also can guide the experimental work with higher probabilities of finding the desired solutions and with fewer trial and error repeats of assays. The accessibility of HPV genomic sequences and functional characterization of the genes involved in the virulence has significantly improved our understanding of the molecular foundation for the pathogenesis of HPV and offered a wealth of data that can be used to design new plans for vaccine design. Nowadays, powerful immune system simulators have been developed using bioinformatics tools which predict artificial immunity provided by the vaccine. These approaches could predict the best adjuvant for using in human vaccine studies. There is a multi-scale computational infrastructure approach which can stimulate the dynamics of the immune response induced by several vaccination formulations and predict optimal combination in terms of adjuvant type, dosage and timing. NetLogo is an agent-based modeling of the immune system running different simulations with different parameter settings. It also can interact with different modeling strategies including the investigation of pathogen growth, life cycle modeling environment for simulation complex phenomena [41] [42] [43] . Therefore, using these methods can increase efficiency and reduce costs in vaccine studies. In this study, for the first time, comprehensively integrated methods (using sequence-based tools in combination with flexible peptide-protein docking) were used to design highly immunogenic and protective vaccine candidates which were able to boost both humoral and cellular Table 12 .

In addition, in vivo analysis demonstrated high potency of the designed L1 and L2 constructs as combined in DNA-based vaccines without the use of adjuvant or delivery system. However, we will improve the efficiency of these DNA-based vaccines using a delivery system and also will compare their efficacy with the designed peptide-based vaccines along with adjuvants in near Future.

Protein alignments and conservancy analysis. To determine conserved epitopes between different subtypes, L1 and L2 sequence datasets were first aligned using SnapGene software 4.2.2 (From GSL Biotech; available at snapgene.com). After protein alignments analysis using muscle algorithms, the conserved epitopes of each protein were selected for immune-bioinformatics analysis such as B-and T-cell epitope prediction. Also, to calculate the degree of variability and conservancy of each epitope, IEDB epitope conservancy tools (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/conservancy/) were used.",

Since the antibodies are induced against linear B-cell epitopes, it would be very difficult to synthesize long peptides with the native protein conformation resembling for the induction of protective antibodies. However, optimal peptide-based vaccines should be presented in a desired secondary structure of peptides in order to induce a specific humoral response 41, 42 .

The red blood cell-depleted pooled splenocytes (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml) were cultured in 48-well plates for 72 h in the presence of 5 \u03bcg/mL of L1 + L2 peptides, RPMI 5% as negative control and 5 \u03bcg/mL of concanavalin A (ConA) as positive control in complete RPMI culture medium. The supernatants were harvested to assess the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-5 and IL-10 from T-cells using the sandwich-based ELISA method (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All data were represented as mean \u00b1 SD for each sample 65 . Granzyme B assay (in vitro CTL activity). To measure Granzyme B (GrB) by ELISA, the P815 target cells (T) were seeded into 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) incubated with the mixture of L1 and L2 peptides (~30 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h. Then, the prepared splenocytes (Effector cells: E, before section) were counted and added to the target cells at E: T ratio of 100: 1 in complete RPMI culture medium for 6 h incubation. Finally, the supernatants were harvested to measure the concentration of GrB by ELISA (eBioscience kit) according to the manufacturer's instruction 64 . Table 16 .

Overall, these results indicated that high-potential helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes can specifically bind to the prevalent HLA molecules in the target populations where the vaccine will be employed.Peptide-protein flexible Docking. Peptides are promising candidates for different types of biological applications such as vaccine design. In recent years, a variety of approaches have been revealed for 'protein-peptide docking, which is, predicting the structure of the protein-peptide complex, starting from the protein structure and the peptide sequence, including variable degrees of information about the peptide binding site and/or conformation. In this study, two different algorithms (Template-based and global docking) were used to calculate docking scores between MHC allele and peptides. At first, structure data of MHC-I and MHC-II were downloaded from RCSB PDB server (https://www.rcsb.org/). Then, all potential epitopes and MHC PDB files were submitted to the server separately. Top model with the highest cluster density (number of elements divided by average cluster RMSD, obtained from CABS-dock server) and interaction similarity score (similarity of the amino acids of the target complex aligned to the contacting residues in the template structure to the template amino acids, obtained from GalexyPepDock server) were selected for each peptide and its MHC(Tables 11 and 12). The results in each MHC allele might vary but in average scores, similarity score and cluster density had the highest average docking scores on both servers.Figure 1represents a sample of successful docking model between peptide and MHC protein (successful docking means epitope binding to an MHC molecule through interaction between their R group of side chains and pockets located on the floor of the MHC molecule).
