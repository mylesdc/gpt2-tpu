Depending on the substitution groups on the aromatic aldehyde used, this reaction will provide different 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrroles in reasonable to moderate yields. Particular attention has been made to these classes of compounds since some of the 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrroles were successfully converted to their respective 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrrolidinones [2] . These pyrrolidinones could be promising intermediates for preparing various synthetically challenging and medicinally important alkaloids such as codonopsinine, anisomycin and preussin [3] [4] [5] .",
