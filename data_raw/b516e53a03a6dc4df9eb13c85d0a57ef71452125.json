Globally, Indigenous peoples may experience a different burden of ARI compared to non-Indigenous peoples. This protocol outlines our process for conducting a systematic review to investigate whether associations between ARI and seasonal or meteorological parameters differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups residing in the same geographical region. Methodology: A search string will be used to search PubMed \u00ae , CAB Abstracts/CAB Direct \u00a9 , and Science Citation Index \u00ae aggregator databases. Articles will be screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria applied first at the title and abstract level, and then at the full article level by two independent reviewers. Articles maintained after full article screening will undergo risk of bias assessment and data will be extracted. Heterogeneity tests, meta-analysis, and forest and funnel plots will be used to synthesize the results of eligible studies. Discussion and registration: This protocol paper describes our systematic review methods to identify and analyze relevant ARI, season, and meteorological literature with robust reporting. The results are intended to improve our understanding of potential associations between seasonal and meteorological parameters and ARI and, if identified, whether this association varies by place, population, or other characteristics. The protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database (#38051).",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) contribute to a substantial global burden of morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . An estimated 14.9 million children were hospitalized for ARI in 2010, of which 265,000 died [3] . Defined as an acute infection with coughing as a symptom [4] , ARI is often associated with meteorological parameters [1] and commonly varies by season [5] . For instance, ARI is commonly associated with temperature parameters, with increasing incidence during cold periods as a result of an individual's exposure, susceptibility, and the infection type [6] . Furthermore, seasonal associations with ARI also have been identified; in some cases, these seasonal associations have been attributed to varying meteorological parameters and in other cases attributed to the pathogen's own rhythmicity [6] . The associations between ARI and meteorological parameters and season may be modified by social gradients of health [7] [8] [9] and affected by type of livelihood [8, 10] . For instance, among Indigenous peoples, a strong connection to the land [11] [12] [13] , resource-based livelihoods [14, 15] , interacting social determinants of health (i.e., housing, education) [9, 14, 16] , and the legacies of colonization [9] may modify the association between infections and meteorological and seasonal parameters [14] . Therefore, it is possible that there are differences in the association between weather variables and ARI among Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. It is important to know if these associations differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities to aid in better planning, resource allocation, and intervention strategies. This paper outlines a protocol for conducting a systematic review to investigate whether associations between ARI and seasonal or meteorological parameters differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups residing in the same geographical region.",

            "text": "The search strategy comprises three main components: Indigenous communities (population and exposure terms); and association between seasonal or meteorological parameters and ARI (outcome terms; Table 2 ). Terms that will be used to identify Indigenous peoples globally are based on a series of umbrella terms for Indigenous used globally and throughout time, adapted from Bartlett et al. [21] . Individual group names were added to the umbrella terms from two sources. First, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA; www.iwgia.org) registry provides a continental directory of Indigenous peoples, further sorted as a country-bycountry list of recognized Indigenous groups. These terms may be at the greater population level, rather than individual group level if the category can be expected to represent and include all of the unique peoples groups within it (i.e., the name \"Maori\" was included in the search terms, but individual Maori group names, such as Ngati Kuri, Ngati Maru, and To Arawa, were not included). Secondly, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) provides a country-by-country database of minority and Indigenous peoples (www.refworld.org). Since this list provides both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, only those groups explicitly listed as Indigenous were collected. The names of all identified groups defined as Indigenous were added to the search. When the two lists were complete, the lists were merged into one, alphabetized, and de-duplicated. The list of terms for Indigenous peoples is comprehensive to the best of the ability of this strategy. Searches of MeSH terms for \"season,\" \"meteorology,\" and \"weather\" were performed in PubMed \u00ae and used to compile terms for the search strategy. Terms that will be used to identify ARI outcomes in the literature include any pathogen known to primarily cause ARI (i.e., enteric pathogens that rarely cause ARI are not included) based on the Medical Microbiology 4th Edition, Chapter 93, online version [22] . Any terms used for ARI by the Lung Disease Alphabetical Listing generated by the American Lung Association (www.lung.org) were added to the search strategy. A search of MeSH terms for \"respiratory\" and \"lung infection\" was performed in PubMed \u00ae and any additional terms were added to the search strategy.",
