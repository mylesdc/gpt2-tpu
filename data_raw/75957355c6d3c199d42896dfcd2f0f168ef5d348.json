Eligibility criteria included patients aged \u22656 months as of 9/1/2012, seeking outpatient medical care for an upper respiratory illness of \u22647 days' duration with cough, and not taking an influenza antiviral before the visit. This prospective study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Nasal and oropharyngeal mucosa were each sampled using polyester swabs that were combined in the same cryovial and delivered to the UPMC Clinical Virology Laboratory within 72 hours. The specimens were stored in a lysis buffer and aliquoted for nucleic acid isolation and detection of influenza virus using CDC's singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) test and a MRT-PCR test using the eSensor XT-8 instrument and respiratory viral panel from GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. In toto, 1171 specimens were collected and tested for presence of influenza using SRT-PCR. Of those, funding was available to analyze with MRT-PCR all specimens SRT-PCRpositive for influenza and a random sample of specimens SRT-PCR-negative for influenza, for a total of 935 specimens that were doubly assayed. The purpose of this study was to compare the agreement between SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR for influenza virus detection.",
