Despite the plant's known immune modulatory potential and chemical make-up, scientific information on its antiviral properties and mode of action have not been completely investigated. In this study, the broad antiviral spectrum and mode of action of an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai was evaluated in vitro, and moreover, the protective effect against divergent influenza A subtypes was determined in BALB/c mice. An effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakai markedly reduced the replication of Influenza A Virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Mechanically, we found that an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent stimulation of the antiviral state in cells. Among various components present in the extract, quercetin was confirmed to have striking antiviral properties. The oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai exhibited preventive effects on BALB/c mice",

During the previous century, deadly viruses have caused pandemics worldwide on a number of occasions [2] . Moreover, new and re-emerging infectious viral diseases will pose a rising global health threat, and the risk of spreading these viruses between continents and countries is even larger [3] .

Vaccines form the basis for the prevention of many viral infections, but there are substantial drawbacks [5] . For the influenza virus only, vaccination failures have been widely documented, and in the elderly population, in which most of the mortality occurs, vaccines are only approximately 50% effective [6] . Moreover, in the eventuality of a pandemic infection with a new strain, antiviral drugs represent the first line of defense [7] . Due to their metabolic properties, viruses are difficult to control, and there are relatively few drugs for the treatment of viral diseases. However, the side effects associated with the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the rapid emergence of antiviral resistance during therapy, has limited the usefulness of these drugs [8, 9] . Therefore, innovative strategies and responses are required to come across the economic and human health risks associated with viral diseases.",

A total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated RAW264.7 cells (1 \u03bcg/mL (1% v/v)) exhibited a marked reduction in GFP expression, whereas the untreated groups had high levels of GFP expression for VSV ( Figure 1A ), PR8 ( Figure 1B) , NDV ( Figure 1C ) and HSV ( Figure 1D ).

Moreover, Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 in HEK293T cells ( Figure 3B ) and the secreted amount was significantly high, and in line with human IFN-\u03b2-treated positive controls.

To correlate these observations with the IFN-inducing signaling pathway, we examined the phosphorylation of interferon related signal molecules and p65 phosphorylation related to NF-kB activation. For this, immunoblot analyses were performed using whole cell lysates of extract-treated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 3C , Epimedium koreanum Nakai significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, p38 and ERK, which are key signaling molecules belonging to the type I interferons (IFNs) and NF-\u03baB pathways. The phosphorylation of IRF3 is a key indicator of interferon signal transduction. Upon virus infection, the phosphorylated IRF3 translocated into the nucleus and initiated the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs). Consequently, the produced type I interferons (IFNs) binds to the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the transcriptional activation of Interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs). These activated ISGs are then involved in controlling viral infection. Our results clearly demonstrate that treatment with the Epimedium koreanum Nakai extract can induce potent IRF3 phosphorylation at 8 hpt, the effect of which markedly increases with time. Furthermore, this increased STAT1 phosphorylation indicates the active functions of the ISGs. In addition to the activation of type I interferons (IFNs), the extract-treated RAW264.7 cells were able to elicit obvious activation of NF-\u03baB (P65), leading to strong secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The phosphorylation of these molecules induced by extracts is comparable to that obtained with LPS treatment, which is a known potent stimulator of TLR4.",

Cells were treated with Epimedium koreanum Nakai at a concentration of 1.0 \u03bcg/mL (10 \u03bcL/mL or 1%). As confirmed by real-time PCR, the mRNA expression levels of various antiviral and interferon stimulatory genes were up-regulated to levels similar to those found with the IFN-\u03b2-treated positive controls ( Figure 4) . Initially, to determine the transcription levels of various antiviral genes in Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated RAW264.7 cells from 0 hpt to 24 hpt, an IFN-\u03b2 real-time PCR assay was performed to monitor the time-dependent mRNA changes. After normalization to GAPDH, the extracttreated cells displayed a seven-fold increase in the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA at 8 hpt and a nine-fold induction level at 12 hpt compared with untreated cells, respectively ( Figure 4A ). Therefore, we performed a PCR assay for other genes of interest at 0, 8 and 12 hpt using specific primers (Tables 2 and 3) in both RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. We found that the transcriptional levels of various antiviral genes were up-regulated by Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 12 hpt, including Mx1, GBP-1 and PML to levels that were 5.6-fold, 28-fold and 15-fold higher, respectively, than those of the control in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, at 8hpt, the IL-6 and OAS-16 transcriptional levels were observed to be up-regulated by 15-fold and 8-fold, respectively. In addition to the elevated levels of IFN-\u03b2, the extract induced the transcription of interferon-stimulatory genes (ISGs), such as ISG-15 and ISG-56 (14-fold and 5-fold), respectively at 8 hpt in RAW264.7 cells. The observed elevated transcriptional patterns for some of the antiviral genes were similar to the pattern of the IFN-\u03b2-treated positive controls. Furthermore, similar transcriptional activation patterns were observed in extract treated HEK293T cells. Interestingly, the highest fold inductions of cellular transcriptional levels were observed at 12 hpt for all the primers. Transcriptional levels of extract-treated HEK293T cells for IFN-\u03b2, GBP-1, IL-6, IL-8, ISG-15, Mx-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were up-regulated by 8-fold, 5-fold, 30-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Importantly, highest transcriptional induction levels of 90-fold and 60-fold were observed for ISG-20 and ISG-56, respectively. All these transcriptional patterns were similar to the pattern of human IFN-\u03b2-treated positive control. The overall results suggest that Epimedium koreanum Nakai has the capacity to up-regulate the transcription levels of IFN-\u03b2, interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) and various antiviral genes. This molecular-level activation may have a direct relationship with the extract's antiviral abilities, which were observed in both RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Tables 2 and 3 .

The mice were orally treated with Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 20 \u00b5g per head in a total volume of 200 \u00b5L before infection with lethal doses of influenza A subtypes. A minimum effective dose of 20 \u00b5g per head was chosen based on our previous in vivo experimental experiences with various herbal extracts (data not shown). After the challenge, the untreated (PBS) groups were observed to have severe illnesses and the body weights were found to decrease progressively. Moreover, the control group succumbed to death by 9 days post infection (dpi), regardless of the virus used for the infection. In contrast, the Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated mice showed a \u226420% body weight loss between 5 and 7 dpi and had begun to recover their lost weight by 8 dpi, returning to their normal state by 13 dpi ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, all the groups that were orally inoculated with the herbal extract pre-infection had similar protection levels: 80% for all of the influenza A subtypes tested ( Figure 5 ). The ability of Epimedium koreanum Nakai to inhibit viral replication in the lung tissues of infected mice was evaluated in an H1N1-infected experimental set. Three mice from each group were sacrificed, and their lungs were collected 3 and 5 days post-infection for viral titration. Overall, the oral inoculation of Epimedium koreanum Nakai reduced the viral titers in the lungs of the infected mice in the extract-treated groups compared with the untreated controls, which had lung viral titers of 5.13 log TCID50/mL and 5.35 log TCID50/mL on 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively. Interestingly, the extract-treated groups had significantly reduced viral titers 2.1 log TCID50/mL and 1.5 log TCID50/mL, at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively ( Figure 5E ).",

For a detailed understanding of the main component profile of the water extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was employed. Among marker compounds of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, quercetin and icariin have been representatively identified at 270 nm based on comparison to the standard compounds (14) . Based on this, we tested the anti-influenza (PR8-GFP) effect of quercetin upon pre-treatment of the compound (5.0 \u03bcg/mL). Minimum effective dose of 5.0 \u03bcg/mL was chosen based on our preliminary experiments on the efficacy of quercetin (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment with quercetin markedly inhibited virus replication ( Figure 6A ). The quercetin-treated group displayed reduced GFP expression compared to untreated groups, which had high levels of GFP expression. The observed GFP data correlated with the viral titers where, quercetin treatment reduced the viral titers by nearly 3.5-fold against PR8-GFP at 24 hpi ( Figure 6B ). Furthermore, treatment of quercetin (5.0 \u03bcg/mL) had marked increase in cytokine secretion in RAW264.7 cells ( Figure  6B ). These data strongly suggest that quercetin, a major constituent of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, might be able to induce the antiviral state in cells and subsequent inhibition of virus replication. (C). Supernatant from RAW264.7 cells treated with media alone, with varying concentrations of Quercetin or with 1000 unit/mL recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b2 were harvested at 24 hpt and tested for secreted murine IFN-\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 using capture antibody-coated ELISA plates. The test was performed in duplicate for IFN-\u03b2 and triplicate for other cytokines. The data show the representative means \u00b1 SD of each murine cytokine measured over time.",

In the cytotoxicity of antiviral reagents, Epimedium koreanum Nakai has been used for human consumption for a long time, and side effects after a dose have rarely been reported. Importantly, Epimedium koreanum Nakai did not have any significant cytotoxic effect on the tested cell lines. Moreover, the cell cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of Epimedium koreanum Nakai was several magnitudes higher than the effective concentrations (EC50) and the selection indexes (SI) of Epimedium koreanum Nakai for various viruses indicate the higher safety margin of the extract for therapeutic and/or prophylactic purposes. First, we found that the total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai inhibited the replication of influenza ( Figure 1B) , VSV ( Figures 1A and 2A) , NDV ( Figure 1C) , and HSV ( Figures 1D and 2B ) viruses in immune cells (RAW264.7) and epithelial cells (HEK293T). Moreover, oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai increased the survival rate of mice subjected to lethal challenges with different influenza A virus subtypes, including H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2 ( Figure 5 ). Although Epimedium koreanum Nakai-inoculated mice initially displayed little weight reduction, the majority of them did not lose more than 25% of their body weight. In contrast, all of the mice in the control groups displayed more than 25% losses within 9 dpi and were humanely killed. Influenza virus causes a rapid reduction in the body weight of infected mice. Therefore, 25% body weight loss is considered the humane end point for sacrificing influenza virus-infected mice [46] . These results suggest that Epimedium koreanum Nakai is sufficiently strong to inhibit viral replication and promoted the survival of mice against lethal infections of diverse influenza A viruses.",

For instance, during pathogenic influenza virus infection, robust cytokine production (cytokine storm), excessive inflammatory infiltrates, and virus-induced tissue destruction all contribute to morbidity and mortality [49] . However, an induced antiviral state by tight regulation will be a very important defense mechanism against virus infection [50] . Interestingly, upon challenge with viruses, a notable pattern of cytokine regulation and secretion was observed in Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated cells, correlating with the observations found in the cell viability assay in this study (Figures 1 and 2) .",

Upon stimulation of the PRRs (Pattern Recognition Receptors) or unknown receptors of the host cell by foreign materials containing pathogens, downstream signal transduction activities, including activation of adaptor signal molecules or transcriptional factors, can initiate the induction of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines to up-regulate the antiviral status of the host cell [51, 52] . In this study, we found that Epimedium koreanum Nakai treatment can induce the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1 and TBK1 in a time-dependent manner, providing evidence of the downstream signal transduction in the type I IFN signaling pathway ( Figure 3C) . Additionally, the activation of NF-\u03baB (p65, pERK, p38), which leads to a strong secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, could also be observed. This phosphorylation can lead to the rapid production of type I IFNs and various inflammatory cytokines that play a pivotal role in stimulating the antiviral state and subsequent clearance of viruses [53] .",

            "text": "Actually, endotoxin (LPS) is a known immunomodulator and is often a contaminant in biological preparations. Thus, one of the principal concerns in the field is that the macrophage-stimulating properties of the herbal extracts may be due to contamination from bacterial endotoxin (LPS or lipid A-associated protein) [54, 55] . Therefore, Epimedium koreanum Nakai was tested for endotoxin contamination using a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL assay) assay and was found to be contaminated with only trace amounts of endotoxin ( Figure 4C ). RAW264.7 cells (mouse macrophages) are versatile immune system cells that play indispensable roles in both the innate and adaptive immune responses [56] . They exhibit various immune responses to pathogenic challenge, such as phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation, and adherence [57] . Because of their wide range of functions, macrophages have been extensively studied for their significant role in the immune system, particularly in antiviral response [58] . Moreover, the immune-stimulating effects of different substances have been well established in murine macrophage cells [23, [59] [60] [61] and previous studies have elucidated the capacity of murine macrophages to achieve the antiviral state upon successful stimulation [22, 62, 63] . Consequently, we decided to use murine macrophages to evaluate the antiviral effect of the water-soluble herbal extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai against divergent viruses. In contrast, human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells are epithelial cells which are less known for their relationship with the immune system. It is known that HEK293T cells have less prominent pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), especially Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [64] . This suggests that for activating the HEK293T cells, an active compound/s must penetrate the cell membrane and activate the receptors present in the cytoplasm. Therefore, it is clear that aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai contains the components which can stimulate both the cell surface PRRs and cytoplasmic PRRs. Therefore, Epimedium koreanum Nakai which has the ability to modulate both RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells in a beneficial manner indicates its broad antiviral potential.",

In our previous study, we identified the main component of Epimedium koreanum Nakai as quercetin and icariin using HPLC [14] . Quercetin, the major active component of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, has been shown to inhibit porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [67, 68] . Based on this lead, we tested quercetin for its antiviral activity and immune-modulatory properties. Quercetin displayed striking antiviral properties and induced cytokine secretion ( Figure 6 ) confirming its importance to the observed biological properties. Therefore, the observed antiviral effects of Epimedium koreanum Nakai must be due to the presence of quercetin and other active compounds in Epimedium koreanum Nakai, and the relationship between mechanisms of antiviral effects and active compounds containing quercetin must be studied further.",
