Household quarantine was very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to 17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635-5403, that is, 63.7%-94.7% of the baseline value. When coupling control measures, household quarantine together with school closure was the most effective strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB) suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier implementation of control measures leads to greater efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic reproduction number, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. Conclusions: Simulated results showed that household quarantine was the most effective control measure, while school closure and household quarantine implemented together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings given sufficient information about the given case and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale.",

This is especially true across whole communities or cities. It is, therefore, difficult to gain enough insight into the interplay of the various factors to predict the development of epidemics and formulate appropriate mitigation strategies. In these circumstances, modelling and simulation are potentially the most powerful tools available to increase understanding of infectious disease transmission processes and disease outbreaks. Importantly, modelling and simulation provide an important foundation for testing possible control measures [13] .",

At the micro level, the exact process of a single infection for most types of infectious disease is unclear, even today [15] . At the macro level, disease diffusion amongst the human population is a complex process, as many factors, both social and physical, can contribute with different magnitudes to disease outcomes.

ABMs are computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous individuals within a heterogeneous population. ABMs are bottom-up models. That is, the macro-level behaviour of the whole system is generated by the simulation of the behaviour of agents at the micro-level. ABMs, formulated in different disciplines such as computer science [16] , geography [17] [18] [19] [20] , epidemiology [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and other interdisciplinary fields [26] [27] [28] , can be applied to simulate the outbreak of infectious diseases and bio-terror attacks, and to explore the efficacy of control measures. The most important advantages of ABMs are that they can consider the heterogeneity of both individuals and environment, and also the stochastic essence of infectious disease transmission. ABMs can express explicitly the differences between individuals in terms of the attributes that influence the process of disease transmission such as physical, social, economic and environmental characteristics. For example, age, gender, occupation and lifestyle variables all contribute to the subsequent disease experience of an individual and the probability of infecting other individuals [29] . The interaction between individuals, which is one of the key components determining infectious disease transmission, can be expressed explicitly in the model. Using ABMs, the heterogeneity of the time lines of infectious diseases, infection probability, demographic dynamics that determine the contact pattern, and the occasional imported infection, can all be considered.",

In February 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States issued the Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation [30] which is based upon an early, targeted, layered application of multiple partially effective non-pharmaceutical measures. Coupled with specific uses of antiviral influenza medications, these strategies aim to reduce transmission of pandemic influenza and mitigate the disease. Briefly, the main four interventions are: (1) isolation of influenza cases; (2) voluntary home quarantine of members of households with influenza; (3) school closure, which includes the dismissal of students from school (also including colleges, universities and childcare facilities) and schoolbased activities; (4) social distancing measures to reduce contact in the community and workplace. It also recommended that the intervention duration should be up to 12 weeks.",

The last two are controversial due to the high social and economic costs from closing schools and public places for certain periods, as well as the social and economic impacts of people refraining from their normal activities. Although non-pharmaceutical control measures are believed to be vital in curtailing the spread of disease, the quality of the evidence on which to base non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions is poor [31] . Further, some research conclusions are contradictory. Take school closure as an example: although the importance of school pupils in the transmission of infectious diseases is acknowledged by most research [25, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , the effectiveness of school closure is not. As reviewed by the World Health Organization Writing Group [38] and Aledort et al.

ISTAM was applied to simulate an influenza outbreak for the same city in an earlier study, and the analysis included the spatial distribution of infection within the city, infection distribution at different types of locations and network analysis. This paper focuses on testing the CDC's suggested control measure strategies. This research provides new information which may be beneficial to the design of a control strategy for epidemic outbreaks, especially for some controversial intervention options such as school closure. Since the novel ABM framework, upon which the paper builds, was published previously by the authors, the basic structure and parameters of the model can be obtained from [32] and only a brief summary is given here.

The values of the above distances vary between populations from different cultures, ages, genders etc. This knowledge provides a basis for within-AB simulation. For example, the model should focus on the changing distances between individuals and, specifically, when the distances are small enough for infection. The contacts between individuals are driven by social purposes or constrained by physical conditions or both, while infection per se is a physical process. Some contacts are indispensable for undertaking some activities. For example, an individual who goes shopping will generally make contact with the salesperson when checking out. Some contacts, although not purposeful, occur due to the restriction of the environment. For example, on a crowded bus, passengers must sit or stand in proximity. The first type of contact is voluntary and is determined by the individuals. The second type of contact is involuntary and is not wholly determined by the individuals.",

In some ABs, such as in a lecture room, individuals are assumed to remain static during the simulation time unit. In other ABs, movements must be considered. At fine spatial scales, individuals' movement patterns may be strongly confined by the physical condition of the current AB and the status of other individuals. Three properties of humans' space-time dynamics within ABs that have been observed in reality are considered when modelling individuals within ISTAM: (1) individuals' static spatial distribution patterns, (2) individuals' movement patterns and (3) minimum distances between individuals.

Five individuals were selected randomly to be the index cases (the initial patients with influenza) and R 0 was calibrated to be 1.79 [48] . Figure 1 shows the number of new cases from different ABs over time (in weeks). The three basic properties can be found in Table 1 : on average, it took 31 days for the number of new infection cases to reach the peak, that is, 308 cases per day. The total number of cases during the outbreak was 5703. Table 2 shows the distribution of infection across different classes of AB. The four main infection sources were household (36%), social place (22.2%), workplace (10.9%) and school (11.9%). The peak day (i.e., day of the outbreak peak) of new infections was the fourth week for most types of AB (Figure 1) , although, notably, was the third week for schools. Most infections at schools occurred from pupil to pupil. This implied that the epidemic outbreak was strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. The control measure specific to schools may, therefore, be important, especially during the early stages of an outbreak.",

The effectiveness of S in reducing the total number of cases was small, a reduction of about 4.2%. (4) For multiple control measures, since A had almost no effect, it is not surprising to see that AH was similar to H, AS was similar to S and AHS was similar to HS. HS (and AHS) were the most effective control strategies: the peak number of cases decreased by 56% to 57%, the total number of cases decreased by 21% to 22% and the peak day was delayed by 17 to 20 days. Table 2 lists the distribution of infections between different types of AB amongst S, H and HS (A is excluded due to its ineffectiveness). Compared with N, S reduced the infection in schools to a very low level, but infection within other ABs also increased in absolute number, compensating for the gain. Compared with N, H reduced the total infection, and the effectiveness varied amongst different types of AB. Thus, the transmission environments (ABs) most resistant to control were home and school, with decreases of 33% and 41%, respectively, while for all other ABs the total number of cases decreased by 63 -69%. HS was the most effective control measure for all types of AB, with the lowest infection rates for any AB type. Table 3 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine), with alert values increasing from 20 to 1000. Clearly, the higher the alert value, the larger the total number of cases and peak number of cases, and the earlier the peak day. With a lower alert value, that is, intervening earlier, control measures were more effective. Table 4 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine) for four values of R 0 (1.24, 1.79, 2.42, and 2.60). By comparing the set of outcomes under control measure HS with the corresponding N scenario (for the same R 0 ) ( Table 4) , it can be seen that the control measure HS was more effective for smaller R 0 values. Because the smaller the R 0 , the lower the probability of an outbreak, the greater the relative decrease in total number of cases and peak number of cases, and the greater the relative delay in the peak day.",

These reductions were rather low compared with some empirical studies [36, 37] which suggest approximately a 15% reduction in the total number of cases and a 40% reduction in the peak number of cases. As Table 2 shows, with school closure, infection in schools was reduced to a very low level, but infection within other ABs increased in absolute number. The explanation is that school closure alone can move pupils' daily activities from school to home, and infection risk at home and other ABs may actually increase. This is consistent with other studies [31, 32, [50] [51] [52] [53] . Milne et al. [51] argued in a comparison study that differences in effectiveness can arise from differences in assumptions about the timing and duration of school closure. It would be interesting to implement such finer level differences within the ISTAM model in future. Another explanation is that the current model does not consider the age dependence of susceptibility and infectiousness. For example, children may be more susceptible and infectious than adults [54, 55] . This should be explored in the future.",

As shown in Table 1 , school closure alone was not particularly effective, but when combined with home quarantine, it reduced the total number of cases more than the sum of these two control measures alone. It should be noted that although the three control measures are applicable to different levels of aggregation (refraining from social activity is applicable to individuals, household quarantine is applicable to all members within households and school closure is applicable to all students), they are not independent of each other. For example, individuals under household quarantine automatically refrain from social activities, and students under household quarantine do not go to school. The overlap between control measures may explain the enhancing effect of combining measures. The combination of non-pharmaceutical measures with pharmaceutical measures needs to be investigated in the future, particularly as for infectious diseases with large R 0 , the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. ISTAM is a novel model for simulating the transmission of infectious disease. The two-level structure (separating between-AB and within-AB activities) makes ISTAM flexible such that it can be applied to novel circumstances. The concept of AB plays a key role: both the building of individual activity patterns and simulation within ABs depends on how well the ABs are defined and classified. The merits of simulation by ISTAM are: (1) ISTAM is straightforward and provides a process-based representation of the real world, (2) using ISTAM, it is easy to account for important factors, neglect less important factors and include random factors in the model and (3) ISTAM facilitates the modelling of human actions (both active and reactive) and the interaction between humans at fine scales. ISTAM, if fed with activity pattern data, can simulate effectively individuals' movements at between-AB and within-AB levels. Providing data sources are sufficient, the model can be extended readily to larger study areas although the effort involved in data collection and model implementation is likely to be substantial and timeconsuming.",

For example, it is assumed that one requirement for transmission is a susceptible person within a certain distance of an infectious person. In fact, for most airborne infectious diseases, airborne disease agents may stay suspended in the air or survive on some surfaces such as door handles for an extended period of time. This suggests co-location may not be a strict requirement for infection. Applying an extended definition of effective contact will be a challenge for future research. Another problem arises due to limited validation. It was not possible to validate the model directly due to the lack of historical data on the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures on disease outbreaks in Eemnes. Nevertheless, several strategies were implemented to validate the model indirectly [39] , with satisfactory results.",

Simulation models provide an important means for evaluating the sensitivity of emergent patterns and their space-time character to changes in model parameters.

Such quantification, while carrying uncertainty due to model structure and parameterization, is not possible by other means such as in vivo, real life, epidemiological or biological experiments. Sensitivity analysis was used to explore the outcome of the simulation for a range of parameter values (compliance level, alert value, R 0 ). For the simulated influenza outbreak in the city of Eemnes, the Netherlands, household quarantine was the most effective control measure in terms of the three indices including total number of cases, peak number of cases and peak day used to assess efficacy. Refraining from social activities was the least effective control measure. School closure alone was of limited efficacy, unless combined with other control measures such as household quarantine. When school closure was used singly, a proportion of infections were displaced to other settings. This conclusion has important implications and is consistent with other research [31, 32, 52, 53] . ABMs should be applied in future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings, conditional upon the availability of sufficient information about the scenario (e.g., demographics, the built environment and humans' daily activities) and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale (specifically, the relationship between transmission and the space-time dynamics of individuals).",
