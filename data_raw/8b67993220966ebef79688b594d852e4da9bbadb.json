            "text": "Although viruses and viral capsids induce rapid immune responses, little is known about viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are exhibited on their surface. Here, we demonstrate that the repeating protein subunit pattern common to most virus capsids is a molecular pattern that induces a Tolllike-receptor-2 (TLR2)-dependent antiviral immune response. This early antiviral immune response regulates the clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections, which are a primary cause of morbidities associated with influenza virus infections. Utilizing this altered susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge as an outcome, we determined that multiple unrelated, empty, and replication-deficient capsids initiated early TLR2-dependent immune responses, similar to intact influenza virus or murine pneumovirus. These TLR2-mediated responses driven by the capsid were not dependent upon the capsid's shape, size, origin, or amino acid sequence. However, they were dependent upon the multisubunit arrangement of the capsid proteins, because unlike intact capsids, individual capsid subunits did not enhance bacterial clearance. Further, we demonstrated that even a linear microfilament protein built from repeating protein subunits (F-actin), but not its monomer (G-actin), induced similar kinetics of subsequent bacterial clearance as did virus capsid. However, although capsids and F-actin induced similar bacterial clearance, in macrophages they required distinct TLR2 heterodimers for this response (TLR2/6 or TLR2/1, respectively) and different phagocyte populations were involved in the execution of these responses in vivo. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 responds to invading viral particles that are composed of repeating protein subunits, indicating that this common architecture of virus capsids is a previously unrecognized molecular pattern.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE Rapid and precise pathogen identification is critical for the initiation of pathogen-specific immune responses and pathogen clearance. Bacteria and fungi express common molecular patterns on their exteriors that are recognized by cell surface-expressed host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) prior to infection. In contrast, viral molecular patterns are primarily nucleic acids, which are recognized after virus internalization. We found that an initial antiviral immune response is induced by the repeating subunit pattern of virus exteriors (capsids), and thus, induction of this response is independent of viral infection. This early response to viral capsids required the cell surface-expressed PRR TLR2 and allowed for improved clearance of subsequent bacterial infection that commonly complicates respiratory viral infections. Since the repeating protein subunit pattern is conserved across viral capsids, this suggests that it is not easy for a virus to change without altering fitness. Targeting this vulnerability could lead to development of a universal antiviral vaccine.",

            "text": "KEYWORDS pattern recognition, bacterial superinfection, innate immunity, Toll-like receptors, virology, virus-host interactions R apid recognition of pathogens by the immune system is essential for the initiation of an efficient immune response. Nature has evolved a delicate system of immunity that allows for the recognition of harmful and/or damaging entities based on conserved elements that mark them as dangerous (1, 2). This early immune response depends on a pathogen recognition event mediated by the host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can either be secreted, expressed on the cell surface, or expressed intracellularly (1). Regardless of their cellular location, PRRs identify specific molecules common among foreign organisms, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (3) . For many bacteria and fungi, there are well-known cell surface-expressed PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that are able to alert the immune system to a threat before infection can be established. In contrast, viruses are typically identified after internalization, based on their nucleic acid recognition by intracellular PRRs (4) . While early reports implicated cell surface-expressed TLRs in immune responses to viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (5, 6) , classical external PAMPs are not known to be present on either the viral capsid or the viral envelope, the most external structures of nonenveloped and enveloped viruses, respectively (4) . Consequently, little is known about common external viral PAMPs and how they could be involved in early antiviral immune responses.",

We showed that antigen-nonspecific priming of the murine lung by a capsid derived from the Salmonella bacteriophage P22 resulted in innate immune imprinting similar to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, and that this imprinting accelerated the immune response to lethal IAV challenge (8, 11, 12) . We also showed that even a non-pathogenassociated capsid, small heat shock protein (sHSP) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, induced immune responses similar to IAV and protected mice from a range of respiratory pathogens, including IAV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Coxiella burnetii, and Staphylococcus aureus (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Immune imprinting by viruses can either reduce or enhance host susceptibility to subsequent bacterial infections (15, 16) . Indeed, our preceding investigation revealed that protection from S. aureus challenge is time-dependent after IAV, with enhanced bacterial clearance 2 to 3 days post-IAV infection and reduced clearance 7 days post-IAV infection (11, 14) . Considering that IAV and the capsids induced similar initial immune responses (9), we hypothesized that the time-dependent change in host susceptibility to subsequent S. aureus challenge, which we reported to occur after IAV infection, is not limited to IAV infection. Therefore, we speculated that this response is induced by recognition of certain common patterns on the virus exterior by host PRRs independently of infection.",

This provided us the opportunity to use this change in host susceptibility to a subsequent S. aureus infection as a readout for the capsid-induced immune responses (11, 14) . We found that recognition of the multisubunit protein assembly architecture of virus capsids by the cell surface-expressed PRR TLR2 was required for induction of these responses. Our investigation also revealed that this time-dependent change in host susceptibility to a subsequent S. aureus infection was induced regardless of the size, shape, origin, or amino acid sequence of the virus capsid, but that induction of this response required the repeating protein subunit arrangement common to the majority of, if not all, virus capsids. Importantly, because the repeating arrangement of protein subunits extends beyond just capsid structure, we also found that linear multisubunit protein assemblies not derived from viruses, such as actin filaments (F-actin), also regulated host susceptibility to a subsequent S. aureus challenge. While we determined that TLR2 was required for initiation of these responses to both capsular and linear repeating protein assemblies, different TLR2 heterodimers (TLR2/6 or TLR2/1) and different effector cells (neutrophils and macrophages) were involved in the execution of these responses when induced by either virus capsids or F-actin.",

Building on previous results demonstrating either sHSP capsid-or IAV-induced clearance of subsequent S. aureus challenge, we examined another capsid, derived from the bacteriophage P22, and a natural mouse virus to ensure that this phenomenon was not capsid or virus specific. As with sHSP capsid, IAV and P22 capsids share no protein similarity, although they do share a similar spherical shape with a polyvalent protein surface (17) (Fig. 1A) . The ability of the host to clear secondary post-IAV S. aureus pneumonia changes over time (11, 14) , and we hypothesized that this time dependence and the associated immune responses may be utilized to characterize similarities in the recognition of the virus and the capsid. To test this initial hypothesis, wild-type (WT) mice were inoculated with either IAV or P22 capsid and then challenged with S. aureus 3, 7, or 14 days later (Fig. 1B) . As capsids are replication deficient, we inoculated mice with 3 consecutive daily doses, mimicking the replication of an infectious virus.",

Alveolar macrophages isolated from P22 capsid-, IAV-, or mock-inoculated mice at day 7 showed similar bactericidal activities toward S. aureus ex vivo (Fig. 1E) .",

Specifically, production of IFN-\u2424 over the course of early viral infection (day 2 to 3) contributes to increased bacterial clearance of S. aureus during subsequent challenge. However, decreased production of IFN-\u2424 and increased production of IFN-\u2423 later in viral infection reduce bacterial clearance (11, 14) . Therefore, we investigated whether the cytokine responses induced by P22 capsid inoculation prior to S. aureus challenge were also similar to those induced by IAV. The two conditions induced similar early production of IFN-\u2424 (day 3) and late production of IFN-\u2423 (day 7) in WT mice compared to mock-inoculated WT mice (Fig. S2 ). This suggests that the induction of a protective immune response was a consequence of the initial viral or capsid recognition events and not a response to active challenge with S. aureus. Activation of adaptive immune responses at later times following active viral infection increases both the magnitude and the complexity of the immune response. Thus, for the remainder of this study, improved bacterial clearance on day 3 p.i. was used as a metric for better understanding the mechanisms of early recognition of virus capsid.",

Our results thus far suggest that active virus infection is not required for induction of the immunologic responses that regulate host susceptibility to subsequent bacterial infection. Thus, we hypothesized that a common structural pattern of viral capsids was recognized by a PRR with broad specificity, such as the TLRs. To reduce the number of possible candidate PRRs involved, the MyD88 adapter molecule, which is used by nearly all members of the TLR family to induce inflammatory signaling upon recognition of PAMPs, was examined (23) . myd88 \u03ea/\u03ea mice inoculated with either IAV or P22 capsid showed impaired clearance of S. aureus from the lung at day 3 p.i. compared to similarly inoculated WT mice ( Fig. 2A) . In addition to acting as a mediator for TLRs, MyD88 also complexes and transmits signals from the inflammation-mediating receptor IL-1R (24, 25) . However, il-1r \u03ea/\u03ea mice, either IAV or P22 inoculated, demonstrated a similar pattern of clearance of S. aureus upon challenge as that seen in WT mice (Fig. S3) , implicating TLRs and not IL-1R as a likely candidate in the recognition of and subsequent immune activation by IAV and P22 capsid.",

The 6-h time point was chosen to identify TLRs involved in early recognition rather than in downstream immune activation events, which could be complicated by recognition of other viral structures, such as nucleic acids. Both IAV and P22 capsid inoculation induced TLR2 and TLR6 mRNA expression. While TLR2 was upregulated in both whole-lung samples and purified alveolar macrophages, TLR6 was upregulated only by alveolar macrophages (Fig. 2B ). Based on the consistent upregulation of TLR2, we assessed the requirement for this receptor in the immune response induced by the capsid. In contrast to WT mice, inoculation of tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice on day 3 p.i. with either IAV (Fig. 2C ) or P22 capsid (Fig. 2D ) did not result in an increase of S. aureus clearance compared to mock-inoculated mice. This indicates that TLR2 signaling was required for the initiation of protective re-sponses. tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice did not present the characteristic cytokine sequelae of type I IFNs and IL-13 at day 3 p.i. Specifically, tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice inoculated with IAV or P22 capsid had no increase in production of IL-13 or IFN-\u2424 compared to mock-inoculated tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, while WT mice inoculated with IAV or P22 capsid had a 2-fold increase in production of IL-13 and IFN-\u2424 compared to mock-inoculated WT mice ( Fig. 2E ; Table S1 ). This indicated that TLR2 signaling contributes to the upregulation of IFN-\u2424 and IL-13 after either IAV or P22 capsid recognition on day 4 p.i. (Fig. 2E) . Furthermore, we found that killing of S. aureus ex vivo by neutrophils and macrophages isolated from tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice on day 3 after inoculation with either IAV or P22 capsid did not induce increased bactericidal activity compared to these cells from WT mice (Fig. S4) .",

TLR2's involvement in the recognition of both IAV and P22 capsid suggested that TLR2 was responding to similar structural patterns on the surface of the two particles. This raised the possibility of TLR2 acting as a generic receptor for common structural elements of viral capsids. Despite having no sequence similarity and having distinct host specificities, IAV and P22 capsid have similar sizes (~80 nm for IAV [28] and 60 nm for P22 capsid [29] ) and spherical shapes. To consider the possibility that size and/or shape may play a role in TLR2-mediated recognition of these particles, we tested a library of capsids with various sizes and shapes for their ability to induce a similar pattern of susceptibility to S. aureus challenge as found with P22 capsid and IAV. To examine the impact of shape, mice were inoculated with a large (~300-nm) rod-shaped capsid derived from a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein (CP) mutant (which forms a capsid in the absence of the nucleic acid cargo [30] ). To examine the impact of size, mice were inoculated with small (~12 nm in diameter [31] ) ferritin capsids of either a self (murine) or foreign (Pyrococcus furiosus) origin (Fig. 3A) . Similar to mice inoculated with P22 capsid, mice inoculated with TMV capsid or with either pyrococcal (nonself) or murine (self) ferritin capsids showed improved bacterial clearance when challenged with S. aureus at day 3 p.i., but not at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 3B) . Additionally, tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice inoculated with TMV or with either ferritin capsid did not clear subsequent S. aureus challenge better than mock-inoculated mice on day 3 p.i. (Fig. 3C) . These results demonstrated that the capsid recognition resulting in time-dependent alteration of host susceptibility to S. aureus pneumonia required TLR2, and was not determined by the capsid's size or shape, and suggested that the capsid recognition preceded the recognition of self versus nonself. Viral capsids have long been known to induce more-efficient humoral responses than their isolated subunits as their repeated subunit structure better cross-links B-cell receptors (32, 33) . While IAV is an enveloped virus, proteins (including primarily hemagglutinin, but also neuraminidase and matrix 2 protein) on the IAV surface are Early Antiviral Immune Response Requires TLR2 \u00ae tightly distributed, with an average spacing between hemagglutinin subunits of~9 nm, leading to a similarly spaced polyvalent protein surface as the coat protein of the P22 capsid (average spacing of~6 nm between subunits) (28, 34) . To consider whether the repeating protein subunit arrangement was similarly required for the TLR2-dependent recognition, we inoculated WT mice with the disassembled P22 coat protein subunit, which can be stably maintained in solution as a dimer (29, 35) (Fig. 3D) . In contrast to mice inoculated with an intact P22 capsid, inoculation of mice with P22 dimer neither showed improved bacterial clearance at day 3 p.i. nor decreased the clearance of S. aureus upon challenge on day 7 p.i. (Fig. 3E) . In fact, mice inoculated with P22 dimer showed a similar pattern of susceptibility to S. aureus challenge as did mock-inoculated mice (Fig. 3E ). This finding further supports the hypothesis that antiviral immune responses mediate time-dependent changes in host susceptibility to subsequent S. aureus challenge via sequence-independent recognition of the structural pattern of the viral capsid. These results strongly suggest/imply a pivotal role for repeating protein subunit structures in the induction of antiviral immune responses by a mechanism involving a common recognition pathway for this pattern.",

The induction of common antiviral immune responses and the requirement for TLR2 by all of the intact capsids examined suggested that TLR2 might be involved in recognizing the repeating subunit pattern of viral capsids. In nature, repeating protein subunit patterns are not limited to capsids, i.e., multisubunit protein assemblies surrounding a hollow cargo volume. Thus, we rationalized that if TLR2 recognition is initiated solely by multisubunit protein assemblies, then it might extend to noncapsid structures. Therefore, we examined filamentous (F) actin as a model noncapsid repeating protein subunit assembly. Unlike the capsids tested thus far, F-actin is an extended helical microfiber, but it is still composed of a repeating protein subunit (Fig. 4A) .",

Thus, F-actin inoculation resulted in a similar time-dependent pattern of host susceptibility to bacterial challenge as did inoculation with either the capsids or viruses (Fig. 1C, 3B , and S1). Additionally, as was found with P22 dimer (Fig. 4C) , the globular F-actin monomers (G-actin) did not induce the time-dependent alteration of susceptibility to S. aureus challenge compared to F-actininoculated mice, further supporting our hypothesis that repeating protein assemblies composed of repeating protein subunits are inducing this response. F-actin inoculation also did not increase clearance of S. aureus in tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at day 3 p.i. compared to F-actin-inoculated WT mice, indicating a requirement for TLR2 in bacterial clearance after F-actin inoculation (Fig. 4D) , similar to IAV and P22 capsid ( Fig. 2C and D) . However, in contrast to IAV and P22 capsid (Fig. 2C) , there was not a significant difference in the production of IFN-\u2424 or IL-13 in the F-actin-inoculated tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to that found in F-actin-inoculated WT mice (Fig. 4E) , suggesting that F-actin induced a different TLR2-mediated mechanism than P22 capsid. As F-actin is known to be recognized by the c-type lectin receptor Clec9a (DNGR1) (36, 37), we determined whether Clec9a was involved in the antiviral immune response regulating host susceptibility to a subsequent bacterial challenge. Inoculation of clec9a \u03ea/\u03ea mice with F-actin resulted in increased clearance of S. aureus compared to mock-treated clec9a \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. S5) , indicating that Clec9a is not required for the F-actin-mediated immune responses that regulate host susceptibility to a subsequent S. aureus pneumonia. Together, these results support a general role for TLR2 recognition of proteins with repeating subunit structure regardless of their origin, but also suggest that TLR2 recognition can be promiscuous and, as such, can result in different downstream cytokine responses.",

The induction of different cytokine responses with a shared TLR2 dependence by P22 capsid and F-actin suggested that there might be differences in cellular recruitment and/or activation. Cellular analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed that P22 capsid inoculation induced recruitment of neutrophils (CD11b \u03e9 Ly6G \u03e9 ; similar to previous results from IAV [14] ) while F-actin did not ( Fig. 5A and S6A ). In fact, the cellular composition of BALF from mice inoculated with F-actin resembled that of mock-inoculated mice and consisted of mostly resident alveolar macrophages (~93% CD11c \u03e9 SiglecF \u03e9 [ Fig. 5A and S6A] ). To determine whether these differences in cellular recruitment into the lung translated into differences in the function of these cells, we tested their bactericidal capacity against S. aureus in the ex vivo assay. P22 capsid increased the bactericidal capacity of both neutrophils (Ly6G \u03e9 ) and macrophages (CD11c \u03e9 ) isolated from WT mice on day 3 p.i., while F-actin increased the bactericidal capacity of only macrophages (Fig. 5B) . These results indicated that while both P22 WT mice were inoculated with F-actin (orange symbols) or PBS (mock; white symbols) (days 0, 1, and 2) and were challenged with S. aureus on either day 3 or day 7, and lung bacterial burden was evaluated 24 h after challenge.

TLR2 can signal as a preassembled heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6 (38) and can induce distinct downstream immune responses (39) (40) (41) (42) ; thus, we speculated that P22 capsid and F-actin engaged different TLR2 heterodimers. To specifically activate the distinct TLR2 heterodimers, mice were inoculated with agonists for TLR2/6 or TLR2/1, PAM2 or PAM3, respectively, prior to S. aureus challenge. PAM2 similarly mimicked the weight loss pattern mediated by P22 capsid with an initial decrease in weight from day 0 to day 3, whereas PAM3 mimicked the weight loss pattern mediated by F-actin with no initial change in weight loss (day 0 to 3, P \u03ed 0.702) (Fig. 5D and C) . PAM3-inoculated mice lost a significant amount of weight from day 3 to day 4 following S. aureus challenge on day 3, whereas PAM2-inoculated mice did not (P \u03ed 0.287) (Fig. 5D ) Additionally, the differences in cellular recruitment induced by P22 capsid and F-actin were recapitulated by PAM2 and PAM3 inoculation, respectively, independently of S. aureus challenge and further indicated that the immune response is dictated by the multisubunit protein inoculation and not the bacterial challenge (Fig. 5E and F and S6B and C) . These results suggested that P22 capsid and F-actin might require distinct TLR2 heterodimers for their antibacterial induced responses. To test this, we utilized immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM macrophages) from tlr1 \u03ea/\u03ea , tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea , or tlr6 \u03ea/\u03ea mice to determine which receptors are involved in the P22 capsid-mediated versus F-actinmediated responses. We found that P22 capsid induced an increase in killing of S. aureus in WT and tlr1 \u03ea/\u03ea BM macrophages, but not in tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea or tlr6 \u03ea/\u03ea BM macrophages, indicating a requirement for TLR6 in the P22 capsid response (Fig. 5G) . F-actin improved killing of S. aureus by WT and tlr6 \u03ea/\u03ea BM macrophages, but not by tlr2 \u03ea/\u03ea or tlr1 \u03ea/\u03ea BM macrophages, indicating a requirement for TLR1 in the F-actin response (Fig. 5H) . Additionally, TMV capsid and both ferritin capsids demonstrated the same killing pattern as F-actin, with only tlr6 \u03ea/\u03ea and WT BM macrophages showing increased killing of S. aureus (Fig. S7) . These results suggest a role for the recognition of P22 capsid and F-actin, as well as the other capsids, by different TLR2 heterodimers and their ability to induce protective responses against S. aureus.",

However, it remains unknown whether these external characteristics of a virus trigger earlier recognition by innate immunity prior to internalization. We previously found that antigenically unrelated protein capsids (sHSP and P22) protected mice from subsequent IAV infection (8, 10, 12) , suggesting that the protective immune responses involved the structural characteristics of the particles rather than the specific sequences of their proteins.

Furthermore, using S. aureus challenge as the readout for the initially induced antiviral immune responses, we found that this response influences the host's capacity to resolve subsequent bacterial infections. Since improved clearance of S. aureus upon challenge could be elicited by the replication-deficient capsids devoid of genetic material, it also indicated that viral infection-independent recognition mechanisms were employed. Our results suggest that virus-induced TLR2 has a role in the upregulation of IFN-\u2424 production, and previous reports have demonstrated that TLR2 ligands can upregulate type I IFNs specifically in endosomal compartments (44) , suggesting that virus-induced TLR2 may involve a similar mechanism. However, although our data suggest a role for TLR2 in induction of IFN-\u2424 on day 4 postinoculation, it remains unknown whether and how TLR2 is involved in the canonical viral recognition pathways earlier during viral infection. Importantly, we provide evidence that these protective immune responses elicited by the capsid are controlled by TLR2.",

Although in this work we did not investigate the biochemical characteristics of TLR2-ligand interactions, others have shown that the specificity of a TLR, specifically TLR9, can be broadened through arranging ligands in repeating patterns. Specifically, Wong and coworkers demonstrated that TLR9 signaling was drastically amplified and that the ligand specificity was broadened by bundled DNA ligands with specifically spaced nucleotides through receptor cross-linking and high-avidity interactions (47) . Thus, it is possible that TLR2 may also have a promiscuous interaction with general features of protein quaternary structure, perhaps due to the inherent multivalent interactions of these structures (32, 33) . We speculate that, since the intersubunit spacing of all the capsids evaluated in this study covers the same low-nanometer range as these DNA ligands (47) (see Fig. S8A in the supplemental material) and individual subunits/dimers could not induce similar responses as the intact repeating protein structures, TLR2 may utilize a similar avidity mechanism as TLR9. Future studies will determine whether the TLR2-based recognition is dependent on the repeating pattern of the same subunit or, rather, as with TLR9, it relies upon the distinct spacing of subunits regardless of whether these subunits are the same or different. Additionally, to which feature of the protein subunit surface TLR2 is responding remains unknown; however, certain chemical elements common to most proteins, including electrostatics, may also play a role (Fig. S8B) .",

Our findings do not suggest that TLR2-dependent processes serve as the only means of viral recognition. Instead, our data indicate that TLR2-mediated immune recognition of general capsid architecture initiates a common antiviral immune response. While F-actin is not a viral capsid, our results demonstrating a similar requirement for TLR2 with virus-like capsids suggest the possibility that it is, at least initially, recognized as such. Thus, it is possible that while P22 capsid and F-actin could be initially recognized by TLR2, their binding to different coreceptors and/or other receptors (48) (49) (50) provides an additional level of recognition that further modifies or validates the initial response. TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 are known to recognize highly similar ligands that differ in one acyl group, specifically the bacterial triacyl lipopeptides (PAM3) and diacyl lipopeptides (PAM2), and these ligands can induce either distinct or similar signaling pathways (39) (40) (41) (42) . The fact that P22 capsid, F-actin, and the other capsids examined in our study, as well as PAM2 and PAM3, are recognized by TLR2, but utilize these different TLR2 heterodimers, suggests that TLR2 may act as a broad immune recognition receptor for viruses or proteins exhibiting a virus capsid-like subunit arrangement. While it remains unclear at this time why different structures utilize different TLR2 heterodimers, this distinction, once elucidated, may provide an additional level of control for the utilization of repeated protein subunit structures as immunomodulatory tools. As viruses can infect at low doses, the possibility remains that intact viruses, as they replicate, may trigger these responses through more complicated pathways. However, we found that TLR2dependent signaling was required for protection from increased bacterial burden early on day 3 post-influenza virus infection.",

Even so, the immune response induced by the initial recognition of the virus eventually wanes and can be further altered by virus-specific genes (51) . Consistent with this, TLR2 does not directly contribute to susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia induced much later, at 1 or 2 weeks post-IAV infection (52, 53) , at which points the immune response is much different from the initial response (18, 19) . However, the report in which TLR2 stimulation in mice prior to IAV infection provided increased survivability supports an early role for TLR2 in virus recognition (54) . Although TLR2 was previously found to be required for protection from increased bacterial burden in a sepsis model of S. aureus infection (55), we found that the presence/absence of TLR2, in the absence of virus/ capsid inoculation, does not affect the bacterial burden in our pneumonia model, suggesting the observed responses are due to the initial antiviral response in the lung environment.",

These reports include human cytomegalovirus (CMV) exposed surface glycoproteins that were shown to require TLR2 for induction of inflammatory cytokine responses (56) , TLR2 in conjunction with TLR9 that was shown to be involved in recognition of herpes simplex virus (HSV) by dendritic cells (57) , and TLR2-and TLR4-mediated recognition of glycoproteins that were implicated in induction of immune responses to both EBV and RSV (5, 6) . Glycoproteins like hemagglutinin and neuraminidase also decorate the envelope of influenza viruses (28) , which we found to induce a TLR2-dependent immune response that was very similar to non-enveloped P22 capsid. Considering these reports, it should be noted that the capsids used here were heterologously expressed and the protein subunits have been previously confirmed by mass spectrometry to not contain detectable glycosylation patterns (58) . Glycoproteins, much like virus capsids, can be organized in a repeating protein subunit pattern (59) . Thus, our results suggest the possibility that the TLR2 recognition of glycoproteins reported for multiple viruses by others could involve the recognition of the repeating pattern of these multisubunit proteins by TLR2.",

Under this model, since viral capsids do not display classical external PAMPs, viruses would usually require infection to occur for currently known viral PAMPs to become exposed to cognate innate immune receptors. The data presented here indicate that there is also immune recognition based purely on the structure of proteins with repeating subunit patterns common to many virus capsids. Understanding this TLR2-mediated recognition mechanism is essential in understanding immune responses to low-immunogenicity pathogens and provides an opportunity for the further development of multisubunit proteinbased prophylactics and therapeutics. Our data also indicate the potential for engineering these ligands to be heterodimer specific. From the perspective of vaccine design, determining the importance of TLR2-dependent recognition of viruses in a more diverse host environment will be necessary to elucidate whether this response is dependent on allelic differences.",

In addition, they provide a mechanistic context for previous studies demonstrating a strong correlation between repeating multisubunit structure and increased immunogenicity even when there is no preexisting adaptive immune memory. Importantly, that the repeating protein subunit pattern is conserved across viral capsids suggests that changing it to escape immune recognition may not be feasible to viruses. Moreover, TLR2 stimulation was shown to be able to provide protection from multiple viruses, not just influenza virus infection (46, 54, 60) . Thus, targeting this viral vulnerability could aid in the development or augmentation of a universal antiviral vaccine, not specific to any single virus.",
