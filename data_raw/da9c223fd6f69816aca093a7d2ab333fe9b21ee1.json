Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 \u03bcg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1-200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces. Results: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively.",

However clinical manifestations vary with physiological status and age [9] , as the virus uses several immune evasion ways to complicate the ability of the host to respond to the infection process [4, 10, 11] . Weaning piglets, in particular, are likely to be exposed to the infection. Although PRRSV viraemia is often asymptomatic in these piglets, their productive performance is significantly decreased. Indeed, despite being sero-negative, persistently infected piglets still harbor PRRSV and have been shown to be a source of virus for susceptible animals [12] .",

It is thus distinct from common non-selective techniques, such as two-dimensional polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) MS. SELDI-TOF MS has been widely used for diagnostic biomarker discovery and validation across studies in blood serum/plasma, particularly in cancer research (reviewed by [13] ), but also to characterize and identify biomarkers associated with viral and other infectious diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The protein signatures identified by SELDI-TOF MS analysis have thus many potential applications in animal health, including early diagnosis of diseases, prediction of disease states, as well as monitoring of disease progression, recovery, and response to vaccination.

Only non-hemolytic samples with similar, low contents of hemoglobin were included in the study. Additionally, to further increase the likelihood to identify statistically significant discriminatory biomarkers, we introduced a fractioning step based on anion-exchange chromatography. In a similar study performed with MALDI-TOF [28] , where serum samples were analyzed in the first weeks (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) Table 3 ). Furthermore, two peaks identified in this study (23. 162 and 14.843 kDa) were similar to peaks identified elsewhere (corresponding to Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 [29] [30] [31] and Galectin 1 [26, 31] , respectively). In accordance with [31] , the identified peak corresponding to Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 was upregulated, while the peak corresponding to Galectin 1 was down-regulated. Thus, these proteins seem to be very interesting and suitable candidates for future investigations. The preponderance of the significant biomarkers had a molecular mass lower than 20 kDa, confirming that small peptides are a rich source of relevant biomarkers in SELDI-TOF MS analyses as previously reported in human [36] and ovine [19] sera. This may also partly be caused by the fact that the low molecular weight region (LMW) of the serum proteome, called peptidome, is an assortment of small intact proteins and proteolytic fragments of larger proteins, including several classes of physiologically important proteins like peptide hormones and components of both the innate and adaptive immune systems (i.e. cytokines and chemokines) [35, 37] . This is particularly interesting as the patho-physiological state of the body's tissue is predominantly reflected in the LMW and low abundance region of the serum proteome, and specific protein fragments of the serum peptidome have been shown to contain a rich source of disease-specific diagnostic information and they have been correlated with disease stages in several studies (reviewed by [37] ).",

This seems to suggest that the corresponding proteins might be of viral origin or related to the innate or adaptive immune responses (e.g. cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins, toll like receptors). In fact, several peaks showed high similarities (MW differences \u22640.3 kDa) with previous works, in particular regarding viral proteins ( Table 3 ). The assignment of the discriminatory peak to a specific protein will require additional work, because the SELDI-TOF technology can only detect masses/peaks of proteins that are differentially expressed between samples but can not directly identify the proteins. This represents one of the major drawbacks of this technology compared to other methods. However, an advantage of the SELDI-TOF MS in this regard is that the results of this technique might lead to the identification of new proteins that were previously not correlated to the disease, and this might hopefully lead to the identification of new biomarkers representing the field situation. The interpretation of these results and the continuation of this project will benefit from the very imminent termination and publication of the sequence of the swine genome [38] , which will definitely contribute to a more precise annotation and a better identification of genes and proteins and thus will greatly facilitate genome wide mapping association studies.",

These results provide a set of proteomic biomarkers and related, optimized experimental conditions for high-throughput profiling of pig populations by SELDI-TOF MS for whole genome association studies, where identification of proteins underlying the phenotype can be made a posteriori. SELDI-TOF MS might therefore represent a complementary test or a possible alternative to classical (PCR) and more recent diagnostic methods (e.g. antibody detection in saliva) for profiling large flocks of pigs at reasonable costs, using blood samples that are routinely collected for general veterinary inspections. As well, these SELDI-TOF MS based tests could complement and provide a broader reference for emerging diagnostic methods and have potential applications for the detection of relevant proteins having highly heritable traits (e.g. acute phase proteins).",

Hemoglobin content of each serum sample was then determined according to [40] with minor modifications. A calibration curve was generated using five standard solutions (concentrations: 1.8, 3.6, 5.4, 7.2, and 9 \u03bcg/ml) of porcine hemoglobin diluted in 400 \u03bcL commercially available porcine serum (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Triplicate samples were incubated for 5\u00c1min at RT, then absorbance (E) was measured at 380, 415, and 440 nm. Absorbance at 380 and 440 nm was used to discern background absorbance flanking the absorbance peak (415\u00c1nm) of oxygenated hemoglobin. Absorbance due to hemoglobin was calculated as: E415-[(E380 + E440)/2]. Hemoglobin absorbance values of the samples were converted to \u03bcg/mL of hemoglobin by means of the calibration curve. Of the 200 initial samples, a total of 120 samples having an absorbance \u2264 0.085 (corresponding to a hemoglobin content below 4.52 \u03bcg/mL) were included in the study; 50 in the discovery and 70 in the validation phases, respectively. Viral RNA extraction from the sera was performed following standard Roche procedures (High Pure Viral RNA Kit, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). Presence or absence of PRRSV was determined by multiplex PCR of conserved regions of viral ORF7 using primers and conditions previously described [41, 42] . The test also enabled to discriminate European and American genotypes and could detect all the different viral strains present in the Lombardy region at the time of sample collection.",
