In these assays, acacetin had consistently higher IC 50 values than isoginkgetin. Subsequently, the acacetin was incubated with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radicals (4-methoxy-TEMPO) and then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS) technology. The results of the UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS analysis suggested the presence of a dimer with m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 peaks. By comparison, standard isoginkgetin yielded peaks at m/z 565 , 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151 in the mass spectra. Based on these experimental data, MS interpretation, and the relevant literature, we concluded that isoginkgetin had higher electron transfer potential than its monomer because of the 3 ,8\"-dimerization. Additionally, acacetin can produce a dimer during its antioxidant process; however, the dimer is not isoginkgetin.",

Thousands of flavonoids have been documented from medicinal plants, especially from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) [2, 3] . These flavonoids can be classified into two types: monoflavonoids (e.g., quercitrin [4] ) and polyflavonoids (e.g., tetrahydroamentoflavone [5] ). The so-called polyflavonoids, however, are predominantly biflavonoids, and biflavonoids can be found to co-exist with monoflavonoids in a same plant (especially CHMs) [6] . By comparison, triflavonoids and tetraflavonoids are very rare in natural products [2, [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "In addition to isoginkgetin, there are at least six 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-biflavonoids, such as ginkgetin, bilobetin, sciadopitysin, amentoflavone, tetrahydroamentoflavone, and amentoflavone-4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032\u2032,7,7\u2032\u2032-tetramethyl ether (Supplementary Figure S1 ). However, some of these 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-biflavonoids are constructed with two nonequivalent flavonoid monomers. For example, bilobetin is made up of an acacetin residue and an apigenin residue. Such a difference may bring about some uncertainties for the comparison. The other 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-biflavonoids (or their flavonoid monomers) are, however, unavailable. In fact, the flavonoid monomer of amentoflavone-4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032\u2032,7,7\u2032\u2032-tetramethyl ether (i.e., amentoflavone-4\u2032,7-dimethyl ether) has not yet been found. Thus, isoginkgetin and acacetin can be considered as an ideal pair for the comparative study. In the present study, isoginkgetin and acacetin were first comparatively investigated for their superoxide anion radical (\u2022O2 -) scavenging effects. \u2022O2 -is an important form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [15] [16] [17] , and a comparison based on the \u2022O2 -scavenging assay can reflect the ROS scavenging levels. Subsequently, isoginkgetin and acacetin were compared using the Cu 2+ reducing antioxidant assay and the 2,2\u2032-azino bis(3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS + \u2022) scavenging antioxidant assay.

Subsequently, isoginkgetin and acacetin were compared using the Cu 2+ reducing antioxidant assay and the 2,2 -azino bis(3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS + \u00b7) scavenging antioxidant assay. Both the Cu 2+ reducing assay and the ABTS + \u00b7 scavenging assay involved electron-transfer (ET) mechanisms and hence may give experimental evidence for the effect of 3 ,8\"-dimerization on the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids. Finally, acacetin was mixed with a stable oxygen-centered radical, the 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radical (4-methoxy-TEMPO), and then analyzed by using cutting-edge ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS) to test the possibility of acacetin conversion into isoginkgetin. Undoubtedly, the evidence from isoginkgetin and acacetin can help us understand the antioxidant action of other 3 ,8\"-biflavones such as amentoflavone, tetrahydroamentoflavone, and amentoflavone-4 ,4\"',7,7\"-tetramethyl ether [5, 7, 10, 11] . Such evidence may also aid medicinal chemists in designing novel and effective antioxidant molecules.",

To compare their relative ROS scavenging levels, acacetin and its 3 ,8\"-dimer isoginkgetin were examined by using the \u00b7O 2 scavenging assay. This assay is based on the pyrogallol autooxidation principle [17] and was improved by our team in a previous study [18] . The improved pyrogallol assay demonstrated that the \u00b7O 2 scavenging percentages of both the flavonoids were increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary 3 Figure S3 .1); however, acacetin had a higher IC 50 value than that of isoginkgetin (Table 1 ). This means that both flavonoids can act as an antioxidant to effectively scavenge \u00b7O 2 -, a typical ROS. However, the higher IC 50 value means that acacetin is an inferior antioxidant to isoginkgetin. The IC 50 value is defined as the lowest concentration with 50% radical inhibition or relative reducing power, calculated by linear regression analysis, and expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). The linear regression was analyzed by using Origin 6.0 professional software. The IC 50 values with different superscripts ( a and b ) between acacetin and isoginkgetin are significantly different (p < 0.05). Trolox was used as the positive control.

To test the possibility of ET in this system, both flavonoids were comparatively examined using the Cu 2+ reducing assay in a pH 7.4 aqueous buffer. The results indicated that the amount of Cu 2+ reduced by acacetin and isoginkgetin increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary 3 Figure S3 .2), implying that these flavonoids possessed potential ET activity in a pH 7.4 aqueous solution. However, acacetin possessed a higher IC 50 value than isoginkgetin (Table 1) . Cu 2+ is not a free radical; however, the Cu 2+ reducing assay is similar to a radical scavenging assay. To fully explore their ET potential in radical scavenging, the two flavonoids were further measured by using the ABTS + \u00b7 scavenging assay. The ABTS + \u00b7 solution was prepared by an ET reaction (Section 3.4), where (NH 4 ) 2 ABTS was oxidized by K 2 S 2 O 8 to give ABTS + \u00b7, a radical with a \u03bb 734 nm absorption peak and dark-green appearance (Supplementary 4 Figure S4 .1) [20] . Thus, the ABTS + \u00b7 scavenging assay is considered as an ET-based radical scavenging reaction [5, 21] . In the assay reaction, the (phenolic) antioxidant transfers one electron to ABTS + \u00b7, which diminishes the \u03bb 734 nm absorption (Supplementary 4 Figure S4 .1).",

A similar dihedral angle can also be observed in other 3 ,8\"-biflavonoids, such as (+)-morelloflavone [13] and amentoflavonoid [22] . The dihedral angle of 45 \u2022 implies that the two acacetin residues are partially planar, and thus, partial \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation can occur through the 3 ,8\"-linkage.

            "text": "Previously, our group reported that phytophenols may generate dimers after incubation with free radicals [27] . To verify whether acacetin can give a dimer, it was treated with 4-methoxy-TEMPO for 24 h in this study. The UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS determination revealed that acacetin yielded a small chromatographic peak at a retention time of 1.8269 min ( Figure 2D ). This chromatographic peak was associated with a MS peak with m/z 566, a value of twice the molecular weight of acacetin ( Figure 2E ), implying the generation of one dimer of acacetin. This dimer further produced several MS/MS peaks, including those at m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 ( Figure 2F ). In accordance with these MS spectra, this dimer was elucidated as that shown in Figure 3A . It should be emphasized that other possible linkages between the two acacetin residues cannot be excluded, such as 7-O, 5\"-O, 6-C, 8-C, and 6\"-C. If a C-O linkage is present, one of the phenolic -OH groups may be involved in the dimerization; thus, the dimeric product is presumed to be less active than the mono-flavonoid. Of course, the identification of the linkage will be the subject of further research in the future. Table 1 . Combined with the Cu 2+ reducing assay results, it can be deduced that acacetin is indeed inferior to isoginkgetin in an antioxidant capacity through ET, and that 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032dimerization can improve the ET potential of antioxidant flavonoids. As seen in Figure 1C , D and Supplementary 2 Figure S2 , isoginkgetin contains two planar acacetin residues; however, the two planar moieties do not share the same plane. There is a dihedral angle of 45\u00b0 between the two acacetin planes. A similar dihedral angle can also be observed in other 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-biflavonoids, such as (+)-morelloflavone [14] and amentoflavonoid [23] . The dihedral angle of 45\u00b0 implies that the two acacetin residues are partially planar, and thus, partial \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation can occur through the 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-linkage. This partial \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation can slightly increase the ET potential, as seen in the Z-resveratrol molecule [24] . Thus, isoginkgetin possesses higher ET potential than acacetin. The ET antioxidant potential is known to be associated with the cytoprotective effect. Thus, our findings can be used to explain why 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-biflavone amentoflavonoid possesses better chemoprevention and neuroprotective effects than its mono-flavonoid apigenin [25] [26] [27] .",
