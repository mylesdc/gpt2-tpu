Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD 50 (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD 50 per dose.",

It can result in great reduction of productivity in adult animals and death in young animals. FMD is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (with sporadic outbreaks in other ''free areas''). In countries affected by the disease, livestock trade and animal products have been impacted. Even in developed countries and areas, outbreak of FMD would greatly affect the economy. In 2001, the outbreak of FMD in England brought a loss of 8 billion dollars [1] , and the consequent occurrence in Holland killed 0.2 million animals [2] . In addition, the 1997 outbreak in Taiwan brought a loss of about 3.6 billion dollars to its exports [3] . Therefore, controlling bath endemic and epidemic FMD has become a global concern in livestock raising.",

            "text": "At present, vaccination is a major means of FMD control in most endemic areas. The present method of FMDV vaccine production is this: The virus is propagated in BHK-21 cell line, concentrated, and chemically inactivated. Although the inactivated vaccine has been shown to be effective, it may lead to new outbreaks of FMD because of either the incomplete inactivation of FMDV in large-scale production or the escape of the live virus from vaccine production workshops [4] . Therefore several expression systems such as E.coli [5] , transgenic plant [6] , yeast [7] , adenovirus vector [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , vaccinia virus vector [13] , and DNA vaccine [14] , have been used for expression of FMDV antigen to prepare subunit vaccines. But such methods have problems such as poor immunogenic capability or low efficiency. Adenovirus based vaccine known for its best protective effects can protect 5 of 5 vaccinated cattle, but this vaccine is still unacceptable because of safety problem and preservation difficulty. The baculovirus expression system, a valuable expression system to produce virus-like particles, has successfully produced many kinds of empty viral capsids [15, 16] , such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, Norwalk-like viruses,SARS and so on [17, 18, 19] . Compared to the baculovirus expression system (AcNPV-Sf cell), silkworm-baculovirus expression system has distinct advantages [20, 21] . First, expression levels in silkworm are 50-1000 times higher than that in insect cell lines. Second, silkworm don not have any pathogens that can cross infect with vertebrates and animal serum is not needed to produce foreign proteins in this expression system, so that the expressed antigens are safer to vertebrates. In view of all these advantages, the silkworm-baculovirus expression system was employed for expression of intact P1-2A, 3C coding regions of FMDV Asia I/HNK/ CHA/05. All five cattle that were vaccinated with diluted expression antigen were induced specific antibody, four of which were considered completely protected. Furthermore, the PD 50 (50% bovine protective dose) value of the subunit vaccine was 6.34 in bovine potency test.",

Discussion FMD still threatens world livestock production. Seven distinct serotypes of FMDV have been identified, named A, O, C, Asia I, SAT I, SAT and SAT with none cross immune protection occurring between them. The FMDV serotype Asia which was first isolated in Pakistan is epidemic within Southeast Asia and Indian peninsula, disseminating among Near East, Middle East and Far East [22] . In March 2005, FMDV serotype Asia was found in HongKong (Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 strain). Subsequently, this type of the virus was reported from mainland of China in April 2005 [23] . The P1 sequence of Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 isolate was aligned and compared with 9 reference sequences.

When the same FMDV expression cassette were expressed in E.coli and baculovirus expression system, the expression products from baculovirus excels that from E.coli in terms of the immunogenic [25] and protective effects [26] . Empty capsid comes into being only when capsid precursor P1-2A, protease L and 3C coding region from FMDV O1K serotype were all expressed in baculovirus expressing system(AcMNPV-Sf cell). Truncated protease L can not be selfcleaved from VP0. But, the expressed protease L is harmful to host cell growth, reducing the expression efficiency [27] . In adenovirus expression system, P12A3C expression cassette, including full structure of P1-2A,3C and portion of 2B and 3B, can be expressed and assembled into empty capsids [8] . Myristoylation of the animo terminus of P1-2A is of great importance to the assembly of viral particles [28] . It has been reported that the expression products of AcMNPV-Sf cell can be myristoylated well [29] . Based on the above studies, and using the design previously published by Mayr et al [8] , the P12A3C expression cassette of FMDV serotype Asia I was constructed. After two sorting rounds of recombinant virus and measurements of expression efficiency for more than 20 viral clones, the over-expressed recombinant virus Bm-P12A3C was obtained. It can express with very high efficiency in the hyperexpression variety of silkworm (JY1). The specific antigen produced per milliliter in silkworm haemolymph at least 100 folds more than the BHK-21 cell vaccine which had a PD 50 value of 3.6.",

We followed the bovine potency test protocol described by the OIE to test this subunit vaccine potency. We used 1/30 diluted dosage to vaccinate five cattle and two controls were vaccinated with vaccine prepared from BmBacPAK-6's. By two weeks post vaccination, the antibody level of the five vaccinated cattle reached a high titer. The antibody level has some ascension but maintained thereafter two weeks, while the control group maintained lower than titer 8. After virulent homologous virus challenge, four of the five were considered protected, and one delayed the disease and ease the clinical symptom, but two unvaccinated cattle developed lesions on all the feet and in the inside of mouth on the second day. Cell-mediated -immune response was probably involved in the protection: that would explain why animal 45 has the same neutralizing antibody titers as 122 but is not protected. This demonstrated that the expression products from silkworm-baculovirus expression system were immunogenic as well. Based on above result, we did the PD50 test to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. When employed for routine prophylactic use, the vaccine should contain at least 3 PD 50 per dose for cattle by OIE recommended. The result showed the subunit vaccine potency could get 6.34 PD 50 a dose for cattle. This leads to a conclusion that it is feasible to use the silkworm-baculovirus expression system for FMD vaccine production. ",

Three groups of five cattle per group and a control group of two non-vaccinated animals were vaccinated. The vaccinated groups were administered different doses (1 dose, 1/3 dose, 1/9 dose)of the subunit vaccine prepared from diluted expression products and all animals were challenged 3 weeks after vaccination with 10,000 BID 50 of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 to the vaccine under test by intradermal inoculation into two sites on the upper surface of the tongue. The animals were observed daily for 10 days after challenge for clinical signs of FMD. Control animals developed lesions on at least three feet. Unprotected animals showed lesions at sites other than the tongue. From each animal protected in each group, the PD 50 (50% bovine protective dose) content of the vaccine was calculated based on the Reed-Muench method.",
