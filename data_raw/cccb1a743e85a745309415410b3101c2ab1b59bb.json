ACE2 has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease. We measured urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels in renal transplant patients (age 54 yrs, 65% male, 38% diabetes, n = 100) and healthy controls (age 45 yrs, 26% male, n = 50), and determined factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 in the patients. Urine from transplant subjects was also assayed for ACE mRNA and protein. No subjects were taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Urinary ACE2 levels were significantly higher in transplant patients compared to controls (p = 0.003 for ACE2 activity, and p#0.001 for ACE2 protein by ELISA or western analysis). Transplant patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly increased urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels compared to non-diabetics (p,0.001), while ACE2 mRNA levels did not differ. Urinary ACE activity and protein were significantly increased in diabetic transplant subjects, while ACE mRNA levels did not differ from non-diabetic subjects. After adjusting for confounding variables, diabetes was significantly associated with urinary ACE2 activity (p = 0.003) and protein levels (p,0.001), while female gender was associated with urinary mRNA levels for both ACE2 and ACE. These data indicate that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes, possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells. Urinary ACE2 could be a marker of renal renin-angiotensin system activation in these patients.",

ACE2 is a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but is not blocked by ACE inhibitors. Although ACE2 is found in many tissues, expression is especially high in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule [3] [4] [5] . In mice deletion of the ACE2 gene is associated with development of late-stage glomerulosclerosis, and acceleration of diabetic nephropathy, in the absence of hypertension [6, 7] . In spontaneously hypertensive rats, administration of human recombinant ACE2 reduces blood pressure [8] , and in diabetic mice, exogenous human ACE2 diminishes blood pressure and glomerular injury [9] . Thus, ACE2 may be an endogenous protector against the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).",

            "text": "In kidney tubular epithelial cells, ACE2 is localized to the apical membrane and also appears in the cytoplasm [3, 10] . ACE2 is shed at its carboxy-terminus from the plasma membrane in cultured human embryonic kidney cells and airway epithelial cells, a process catalyzed by the enzyme ''a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17'' (ADAM-17) [11] [12] [13] . Whether this process occurs in the proximal tubule is unclear, although soluble ACE2 has been detected in human urine [10] . In a recent study, urinary levels of ACE2 protein were significantly increased in humans with CKD (the majority with chronic glomerulonephritis), compared to healthy controls, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14] . Urinary ACE2 was also higher in diabetics with CKD [14] . These results suggest that ACE2 may be shed into the urine, and could be a biomarker in CKD patients. However, the presence of urinary ACE2 has not been studied in renal transplant recipients, and the factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 remain unclear. Accordingly, the principle objective of the present study was to determine if urinary ACE2 activity, protein, and mRNA can be detected in renal transplant patients, and to identify factors associated with the presence of ACE2. In addition, we examined factors associated with urinary ACE activity, protein and mRNA in these patients. Our data indicate that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes, possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells.",

Urinary ACE2 Activity, Protein, and mRNA As shown in Figure 1A , urinary ACE2 activity was significantly increased in transplant patients, compared to control subjects [control; median: 1.90 (IQR, 1.04-2.70) ng-eq/mg Cr610 2 vs transplants; median: 3.65 (IQR, 1.13-9.35) ng-eq/mg Cr610 2 ; p = 0.003]. Similarly urinary ACE2 protein by ELISA was significantly increased in transplant patients, compared to controls ( Figure 1B ) [control; median: 1.41 (IQR, 0.00-4.49) ng/mg Cr vs transplants; median: 8.04 (IQR, 0.00-21.11) ng/mg Cr; p,0.001]. In 96% of unconcentrated urine samples from control and 94% from transplant subjects, ACE2 was identified by western analysis as a protein doublet of 120 kDa and 90 kDa. As with urinary ACE2 activity and ELISA measurements, western analyses revealed a significant increase in urinary ACE2 protein in transplant patients compared to controls ( Figure 1C : p = 0.001).",

The gene for ACE2 is located on the X chromosome [2] , and in the rat renal wrap model of hypertension, intrarenal ACE2 activity and expression are upregulated by estrogens [23] , raising the possibility that female transplant recipients may express ACE2 mRNA at higher levels in the kidney compared to males. Female gender was also associated with higher urinary ACE mRNA levels, as was albuminuria, the latter being in agreement with studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy [24] . The cellular origin of urinary mRNA for ACE2 or ACE is unknown, although it has been speculated that proximal tubular cells may be the source, since they express all components of the RAS, and are found in the urine sediment [24] . However, the physiological significance of urinary ACE2 or ACE mRNA levels is unclear. In this regard, diabetes, albuminuria and eGFR did not influence urinary ACE2 mRNA levels in our transplant recipients, a result that differs from diabetic nephropathy patients, where proteinuria was found to correlate positively with urinary ACE2 mRNA, and eGFR to correlate negatively with ACE2 mRNA [24] . Factors related to transplant could therefore have an independent influence on urinary ACE2 mRNA. As one possibility, the use of immunosuppressive drugs in transplant subjects might regulate shedding of cells expressing ACE2 mRNA into the urine.",

            "text": "Urinary ACE2 protein could originate at least partly from plasma (via filtration at the glomerulus), or it could be derived via excretion from renal cells. Although Mizuiri et al. found higher urinary ACE2 levels in CKD patients, there was no difference in plasma ACE2 protein between CKD patients and healthy subjects [14] . However, the CKD patients in their study had significant albuminuria, suggesting that ACE2 may have leaked into the urine across the glomerular barrier. In the present study, we found no association between albuminuria and either urinary ACE2 activity or protein levels by western analysis. The data suggest that urinary ACE2 protein likely derives via shedding from cells along the nephron, and not from filtration from plasma. In support of this hypothesis, soluble ACE2 is shed from the plasma membrane in cell culture systems, via cleavage at its ectodomain by the protease enzyme ADAM-17 [11] [12] [13] . Interestingly, renal ADAM-17 is upregulated in Ang II-induced kidney injury [25] , and de novo expression occurs in human kidney disease, in proximal tubule, podocytes, and mesangial cells [26] . Whether ADAM-17 is activated in the transplant kidney in the presence of diabetes, and mediates shedding of soluble ACE2 into the urine requires further study. Two bands for ACE2 were detected by immunoblot of urine samples in the current study. One band was found at 120 kDA, consistent with the full-length protein, and the other at 90 kDa, which is likely a cleaved ACE2 fragment. Thus, the 90 kDa fragment does not simply represent a deglycosylated form of fulllength ACE2, since incubation with PNGase F resulted in a further reduction in its size, as shown in Figure 2D . To determine if this 90 kDa fragment is generated by ADAM-17-mediated cleavage of ACE2, further characterization is required, including use of antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic carboxyterminus of ACE2 (which may be lacking in this fragment), and/or direct sequence analysis of the polypeptide. Furthermore, although shedding of ACE2 fragments may occur via ADAM-17 in transplant subjects, proteomic analysis has identified ACE2 as one of the 1132 proteins present in urinary exosomes isolated from human urine [27] , suggesting that membrane-bound full-length ACE2 may also be a source of urinary ACE2.",

In this regard, although diabetic patients had significantly higher urinary ACE activity and ACE protein levels by immunoblot, this association was not confirmed in the multivariate analysis. Finally, although diabetics had higher urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels, there was no significant association between diabetes and urinary levels of Ang-(1-7) by multivariate analysis, suggesting that urinary Ang-(1-7) may be influenced by other factors. A potential limitation of the urinary angiotensin peptide measurements is that urine specimens were not treated with protease inhibitors, which could have affected the sensitivity for detecting differences. Interestingly, however, we did observe a significant correlation between urinary ACE2 activity and Ang-(1-7) levels.",

Furthermore, it is possible that diabetes alone may contribute to increased urinary ACE2 levels, independent of transplant status.

Larger studies are also needed to determine if urinary ACE2 or ACE are biomarkers of transplant function or if they may predict responsiveness to blockade of the RAS.",
