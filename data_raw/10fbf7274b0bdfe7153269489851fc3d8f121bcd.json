            "text": "In mammalian cells, the first line of defense against viral pathogens is the innate immune response, which is characterized by induction of type I interferons (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that establish an antiviral milieu both in infected cells and in neighboring uninfected cells. Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5' phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylated 5' cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5' capping or 2'-Omethylation of the 5' cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors.

            "text": "RV is a member of the Reoviridae family of non-enveloped, segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. The virus exhibits host-range restricted replication, such that viruses from one species (homologous host) are only infrequently isolated from another species (heterologous host) [4, 5] . The RV triple layer particle (TLP), encapsidating the eleven dsRNA genome segments, binds to cells via its attachment protein VP4 and enters through the early endosomal pathway. Upon entry, the outer layer of the viral capsid is shed, revealing a transcriptionally active double-layer particle (DLP). The virusencoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRP, uses the minus-strand of the segmented dsRNA genome as a template to generate mRNAs, which are extruded into the cytoplasm. Some of these mRNAs are translated into viral proteins, while others accumulate in cytoplasmic inclusions called viroplasms where they are packaged into newly forming subviral particles. During this encapsidation step, RV plus-strand RNAs undergo a single round of minus-strand replication to generate a complete set of eleven dsRNA genome segments. Capsid formation occurs concurrently with encapsidation and genome replication. Progeny subviral particles bud through the endoplasmic reticulum, where they mature into TLPs that then exit the cell via lysis or exocytosis [6] .",

            "text": "Upon infection of mammalian cells with bacterial or viral pathogens, an early line of defense, termed the innate immune response, is triggered. The innate immune response is initiated by host proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented during the microbial infection. The innate immune response is characterized by the production of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and many other pro-inflammatory cytokines [7] . Binding of type I IFNs in an autocrine or paracrine manner to the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor initiates a JAK/STAT signaling cascade, which culminates in the upregulation of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) [7] . ISGs encode effector proteins such as PKR, OAS, and Mx that create an antiviral environment within infected and neighboring uninfected bystander cells [8] . The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the bestcharacterized family of PRRs. These membrane-bound receptors recognize different microbial signatures either at the cell surface or within the endosomal compartment, and in many cases their expression is limited to innate immune cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and macrophages [9] . More recently, a new family of cytoplasmic PRRs known as the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) was identified, and these sensors have been shown to play critical roles in defending against a wide variety of viruses in multiple cell types [10, 11] . The RLR family comprises RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, and these receptors recognize distinct RNA PAMPs. Thus far, ligands found to activate RIG-I include uncapped 5'-triphosphorylated (5' ppp) ssRNA [12, 13, 14, 15] , 5' ppp ssRNA containing polyuridine or polyadenine stretches [16, 17] , 5' ppp base-paired RNAs [18, 19] , short dsRNA [20, 21] , and 3'-monophosphorylated RNA [22] . MDA5 has been shown to detect longer (>2 kb) dsRNA stretches [20] and higher-order RNA structures [23] , and has been linked to sensing of RNAs with incompletely 2'-Omethylated 5' cap structures [24] . RIG-I and MDA5 share similar protein organization, with two tandem N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), followed by a DExD/H box helicase domain, and terminating with a regulatory/repressor domain. Unlike RIG-I and MDA5, LGP2 does not contain the N-terminal CARDs, and it has been shown to function either as an activator or repressor of RLR signaling, depending on the virus [25, 26, 27, 28] . Upon binding of RIG-I and MDA5 to their respective RNA ligands, they undergo conformational changes, multimerize, are modified with polyubiquitin chains, and form a CARD-mediated complex with the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS (also known as VISA, Cardif, and IPS1) [27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] . MAVS serves as a platform for recruitment of kinases and other signaling proteins, leading to activation of the transcription factors IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB, which are required for induction of type I IFN expression [31, 32, 33, 34] .",

Much less is known about the role of innate immune signaling in protection from RV infection, however. Experiments in vitro indicate that RV infection induces an early IFN response, but in most cases the virus rapidly suppresses IFN signaling through the actions of viral proteins such as NSP1 [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] . Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that although RV does not replicate efficiently in human pDCs, it still induces type I IFN production in a process requiring both viral dsRNA and structural proteins [44] . Recently, Sen et al. reported that RV infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts induces a MAVS-dependent early antiviral transcriptional response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, neither of which was independently essential for IFN production [45] . IFN induction in a RV-infected intestinal epithelial cell line was also shown to require MAVS and involved both RIG-I and MDA5 [46] . These results suggest that RV infection produces both RIG-I and MDA5 PAMPs. Similar conclusions were made in studies with the related reovirus [47] . A previous attempt to identify PAMPs produced by reovirus used genomic dsRNA of different sizes purified from viral particles to demonstrate that the shorter segments preferentially signal through RIG-I and the longer segments preferentially signal through MDA5 [20] . Whether the reovirus dsRNA genome functions as a PAMP during actual infection is not clear however. Despite considerable efforts, the specific RV PAMPs that are detected by and activate the RLRs have, thus far, remained elusive.",

Enzymatic characterization studies indicate that RV transcription produces uncapped RNAs with exposed 5' phosphate groups and RNAs with incompletely 2'-O-methylated 5' cap structures. These two RNA signatures provide a molecular basis for how RV induces RLR-dependent innate immune signaling.",

Primary RV transcription takes place in the cytoplasm, where the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) reside. Secondary transcription and replication take place in protein-dense viroplasm structures, in which viral RNAs are protected from RNAi degradation [49] . Production of genomic dsRNA takes place in viroplasms concurrently with subviral particle formation, and therefore it is unlikely that naked dsRNA genome segments, either from input or replicating virus, are present in any substantial amount as free molecules in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that RV ssRNA transcripts, and not genomic dsRNA, would likely be the primary immunostimulatory molecules generated during infection. To address this hypothesis, we took two complementary approaches to isolate RV RNAs for subsequent characterization. The first approach was to purify RV RNA products from in vitro-transcription (IVT) reactions carried out using highly purified RV double-layer particles (DLPs), and the second approach was to purify RNAs from RV-infected cells.",

The first question we asked was what types of RNAs are generated in IVT reactions. To address this question, we purified DLPs from MA104 monkey kidney cells infected with the rhesus rotavirus (RRV) strain, and carried out IVT reactions with DLPs, \u03b1-32 P-GTP, and all four NTPs (complete conditions) or in the absence of ATP (incomplete conditions). As a negative control, we included a reaction lacking DLPs. After a 5-hour incubation at 42\u00b0C, reactions were treated with antarctic phosphatase to digest unincorporated NTPs into inorganic phosphate (P i ). RNA products from each reaction were analyzed on a denaturing 20% urea-acrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 1A , nascent transcripts as well as short oligonucleotides (oligos) were generated in the complete IVT reaction. In the incomplete reaction, we detected short oligos but not larger transcripts, and generation of the short oligos was enhanced under incomplete conditions, consistent with several previous reports [51, 52] . As expected, no RNA products were detected in the IVT reaction lacking RV DLPs.",

Total RNA was then purified from the reactions and applied to a denaturing urea-acrylamide gel, and UV shadowing was used to visualize the RNA. In the complete IVT reaction lane, a region of large molecular weight (MW) RNAs was visible beginning at the bottom of the well and extending to approximately 1 centimeter below the well. We did not visualize a region of large MW RNAs in the incomplete IVT reaction lane. The large MW RNAs seen in the complete IVT reaction are presumed to include both nascent transcripts as well as input genomic dsRNA released from the DLPs during the RNA extraction process. However, because the amount of nascent transcripts in the complete IVT sample greatly exceeds that of input genomic dsRNA, we believe that the large MW smear detected by UV shadowing was mostly, if not entirely, due to the nascent transcripts and not the input genomic dsRNA. The incomplete IVT reaction contained an equivalent amount of input genomic dsRNA, but because the actual amount of this dsRNA was low and UV shadowing has limited sensitivity, a large MW RNA smear was not visible in the incomplete IVT reaction lane. A small MW smear at the very bottom of the gel just below the bromophenol blue dye front (expected size of 8 nucleotides) was detected in both IVTs, and this smear likely contained both short oligos and unincorporated NTPs. No RNAs were detected in the middle of the gel in either lane, similar to the findings in Figure 1A . The large MW region at the top of the gel (including the bottom of the well) was excised from the complete IVT lane. A region of comparable size was also excised from the top of the gel in the incomplete IVT lane even though no RNA smear was visible in this region.

This result indicates that the large MW RNAs purified from the complete IVT reaction, and not the short oligos, are capable of inducing IFN signaling. Notably, the large MW RNA fraction (containing only input genomic dsRNA) purified from the incomplete IVT reaction was much less stimulatory than the large MW RNA fraction purified from the complete IVT reaction ( Figure 1B ).

To identify other RNA candidates with immunostimulatory potential generated in RV-infected cells, MA104 cells were infected with RRV at an estimated MOI of 5 for 1 or 6 hours (hr), cytoplasmic extracts were generated from the infected cells, and total RNA was isolated from the cytoplasmic extracts. We selected a 6 hr time-point to isolate potentially stimulatory RV RNAs because at 6 hpi primary RV transcription is thought to occur outside of the viroplasm structures [49] , and therefore these RV transcripts would be more available for detection by the cytoplasmic RLRs. Total RNA samples isolated from infected MA104 cells were digested with proteinase K and deproteinized by extraction. To selectively remove the excess quantity of small cellular RNAs (i.e. rRNAs and tRNAs) from this total RNA sample, we used 2.5 M lithium chloride (LiCl) to precipitate RNAs over 100 nucleotides (nt), resulting in a large RNA fraction (termed in vivo large RNAs). Equivalent amounts of the 1 hr large RNA fraction (containing input RV genomic dsRNA but little if any newly synthesized RV ssRNA transcripts or newly synthesized genomic dsRNA) and 6 hr large RNA fraction (containing input RV genomic dsRNA, newly synthesized RV ssRNA transcripts, and some newly synthesized genomic dsRNA) were transfected into wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Cell culture media was collected 21 hours post-transfection and the amount of secreted IFN-beta quantified using ELISA. As shown in Figure 2B , the large RNA fraction isolated from MA104 cells infected with RV for 6 hours, but not 1 hour, was highly immunostimulatory. These results indicate that 1) the amount of RV genomic dsRNA present in the input inoculum is not sufficient to induce IFN, and 2) production of immunostimulatory RNAs in vivo requires RV transcription and/or replication.",

We incubated the in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples with: 2'-Omethyltransferase to add a 2'-O-methyl group to any transcripts that were incompletely methylated, antarctic phosphatase to remove any exposed phosphate groups from the RV transcripts, or vaccinia capping enzyme to add a 5' 7methylguanine cap to any newly synthesized transcripts that had not been capped. Control reactions lacking these three enzymes were also set up. After the reactions were carried out, RNAs were purified and transfected into WT MEFs, and the level of secreted IFN-beta measured by ELISA 21 hr posttransfection. As shown in Figure 4A , we observed that 2'-Omethyltransferase-treatment did not decrease the IFN stimulatory potential of the in vitro ssRNA sample. However, treatment of the in vitro ssRNA sample with either antarctic phosphatase or capping enzyme significantly reduced its IFN stimulatory potential ( Figure 4A ).

Although it has long been known that RV induces IFN signaling, and also efficiently blocks this pathway, the molecular basis for how RV triggers an innate response has remained unclear. Using an in vitrotranscription approach, we demonstrated that nascent RV ssRNA transcripts have IFN stimulatory potential, suggesting that they possess at least one PAMP. In a complementary approach, we isolated large RNA (>100 nt) fractions from cells infected with RV for 1 or 6 hours and determined that the 6 but not the 1 hour RNA sample also induced IFN signaling. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that RV RNA transcripts generated both in vitro with purified RV DLPs and in vivo in RV-infected cells contain immunostimulatory PAMPs. We further found that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 contributes to downstream innate immune signaling from these RNA samples. The RLR mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS was also shown to be necessary for this response. Our findings confirm a recent postulation by Holloway and Coulson that RV plus-sense RNA transcripts could be possible RIG-I and/or MDA5 ligands because they are localized to the cytoplasm during RV infection and could potentially contain motifs known to trigger RIG-I/MDA5 signaling [57] .",

It is possible that some newly synthesized RV genomic dsRNA could have been present in our in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample and could have been a source of IFN stimulation in our experiments. However, it is important to note that during RV infection, the dsRNA genome is generated during assembly of subviral particles. This process takes place in protein-rich viroplasm structures, which have been shown to protect viral RNAs from RNAi degradation [49] . As such, it seems unlikely that naked Previous studies from our laboratory and others have determined that RV infection stimulates a MAVS-dependent early antiviral response that involves either RIG-I or MDA5, neither being absolutely required for signaling [45, 46] . Our results are mostly consistent with these reports in that we found that MDA5 contributes to and MAVS is required for IFN production in response to both the in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples. However, in our experiments, we observed that RIG-I is indispensable for the IFN response to these RNA samples (Figure 3 ). One potential explanation for these different results is that our in vivo large RNA fraction was purified from cells at an early time-point post-infection, when the PAMPs that are produced may be primarily sensed by RIG-I. It is possible that later during infection, RV ligands that are primarily detected by MDA5, such as higher-order RNA structures or \"webs\", may be generated as the level of RV transcription increases and RNAs accumulate in the cell [23] .",

            "text": "In eukaryotes, newly transcribed RNAs initially contain a 5' triphosphorylated end, but during subsequent processing of most cellular transcripts the exposed 5' triphosphate ends are converted to a monophosphate or a guanine cap. The type I cap structure of many higher eukaryotic mRNAs is modified with a methyl group at the N7 position of the guanosine capping residue and the ribose-2'-O position of the 5'penultimate residue (m 7 GpppGm). In addition to enhancing mRNA stability and translational efficiency, the 5' cap structure is one way that host cells discriminate self from non-self RNA. The ability of viruses to activate RIG-I signaling through the production of uncapped RNAs with exposed 5' phosphate groups is well-described in the literature [13, 14, 15] . Many viruses replicate in the cytoplasm and have therefore evolved their own capping and methylation machinery or mechanisms to \"snatch\" the caps from host mRNAs in order to mimic self-RNA and avoid detection by the host. N7 methylation of the 5' cap is important for mRNA processes such as transcription elongation, polyadenylation, splicing, nuclear export, and efficient translation [59] . Until recently, the function of 2'-Omethylation of 5' cap structures was unknown. A few years ago, Daffis and colleagues discovered that a West Nile virus mutant lacking 2'-O-methyltransferase activity was attenuated in wild type cells, but pathogenic in cells with a defective IFN signaling pathway. They found that cap 2'-O-methylation prevented sequestration by IFIT proteins, which act downstream of IFN production as regulators of protein translation [60] . Since then, Zust et al. has demonstrated that coronavirus 2'-O-methyltransferase mutants are more potent IFN inducers than wild type viruses and that MDA5 was required for the IFN response to viral mRNAs lacking 2'-Omethyl modification [24] .",

However, the immunostimulatory potential of the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample was significantly reduced by 2'-Omethyltransferase-treatment (Figure 4 ). One possible explanation for the different results obtained with the in vivo and in vitro RNA samples is that in the IVT reaction the concentration of the methyl donor, SAM, may be higher than in an actual cell, and therefore the in vitro methylation reaction may be more efficient. Interestingly, early efforts to characterize the 5' and 3' ends of RV genomic dsRNA purified from DLPs determined that their 5' cap structures are only partially 2'-O-methylated on the 5'-penultimate residue [56] , consistent with the results of our in vivo experiments.",

RV has been shown to suppress IFN induction by targeting the transcription factors IRF3/5/7 for degradation through non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) [37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43] . In some strains, RV NSP1 was found to also target \u03b2-TrCP for degradation, thereby shutting off the NF-\u03baB pathway, which is also required for IFN upregulation [41] . Recently, NSP1 was shown to interact with RIG-I and downregulate its protein levels, indicating another potential mechanism by which RV can antagonize the IFN response [61] . In other studies, RV has been shown to directly interfere with STAT1 activation [62] . NSP1 has been identified as an important genetic determinant of host range-restriction of murine RV replication in the murine intestinal tract [63, 64] , but other RV genes including VP3 and VP4 may also contribute to different replication phenotypes [65, 66] . It is plausible that even minor variations in VP3 capping and methyltransferase activities could manifest as differential abilities to stimulate antiviral signaling, thereby limiting replication.",

We carried out experiments with RNases that target base-paired regions of RNAs and our preliminary results indicate that RV transcripts contain structured regions (data not shown). This preliminary observation is supported by computer modeling and RNase mapping studies which suggest that RV plus-strand RNAs form panhandle structures through base-pairing between the 5' and 3' ends [67, 68, 69] . Such secondary and possibly tertiary structures within RV transcripts could constitute additional PAMPs for RIG-I and possibly MDA5. It is also possible that RV infection generates PAMPs that are sensed by other PRRs, such as TLR3, later in infection. Indeed in vivo studies in a mouse model of RV infection showed that age-dependent TLR3 expression within the intestinal epithelium may be implicated in susceptibility to RV infection [70] . Future work will be needed to determine if additional molecular patterns are produced at different timepoints during RV infection. Increased understanding of the molecular basis for RV stimulation of innate immunity will be important in the design of more effective third generation live virus vaccines and targeted antiviral therapeutics.",
