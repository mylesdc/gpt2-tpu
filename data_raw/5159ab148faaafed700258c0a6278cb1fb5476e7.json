            "text": "Chikungunya (CHIK), an Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, causes human febrile illness accompanied by severe, chronic joint pain. It has emerged and reemerged in Africa and Asia since the mid 1950s and exploded onto the global scene as a major emerging pathogen in a series of devastating outbreaks since 2004 [1, 2] . CHIK is a potential global threat to public health because it is transmitted by mosquitoes in areas where there are large populations of susceptible human hosts. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses showed that CHIK of African origin spread by two distinct routes, one throughout the Indian Ocean and the other moving from India to scattered locations in Southeast Asia and then to Italy [1] . The first incidence of CHIK in mainland China was firstly detected in 2008 [3] . A sudden outbreak among 173 patients was also reported in Guangdong Province, China, in 2010 [4] . In this article, we report the first isolation of CHIK virus in Zhejiang province, China, a nonindigenous region for CHIK, using a modified approach based on the classic cDNA-AFLP in virus discovery. We propose this modification as a better technique because it may improve accuracy in the hunt for viral segments and in determining the genome sequence of both DNA and RNA viruses on a larger scale. Our aims in this study were therefore the following: 1) test our modified work flow of the classic cDNA-AFLP method using CHIK isolation as the study material; 2) determine the entire genome sequence of CHIK; 3) understand the molecular characterization of the CHIK isolate and the phylogenetic patterns of CHIK in Asia to aid in further studies and to evaluate its persistence in China.",

The cell lines we used are gifts from National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention.

The RT-PCT assay was conducted using the Revertaid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). The classic cDNA-AFLP method was enzyme digestion, followed by ligation, nest PCR and clone sequencing [5] . Our modified workflow started with whole genome amplification (WGA) using QIAGEN REPL-g Mini Kit (Qiagen). We applied ethanol precipitation as purification for the post-WGA procedure. We used NanoVue (GE Healthcare) for quality control, including concentration testing, and absorbance detection. We then performed enzyme digestion using HinP1-I and Mse-I for 2 h at 37uC. Adaptor ligation was followed using the pre-mixed adaptors (HinP1-I anchors. Top strand: 5-GACGATGAGTCCTGA C-3; Bottom strand: 5-CGGTCAGGACTCAT-3; Mse-I anchor: Top strand: 5-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3; Bottom strand: 5-TAGGTACGCAGTC-3). The ligation was performed for 2 h at 37uC. Based on nested PCR according to classic methods [5] , we applied different DNA polymerases. We chose Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Life Technologies) instead of AmpliTag Gold (Life Technologies), as the former enzyme has improved sensitivity and its amplicon size can be up to 8 kb. The system of nested PCR was adjusted following the manufacturer's instructions according to the changed enzyme. Primer sets for whole nest PCR are in table 1. According to the classic cDNA-AFLP methods, the first PCR run was initial denaturing for 5 min at 94uC followed by 20 cycles of 1 min at 94uC, 1 min at 55uC, 2 min of elongation at 72uC, ending with a 10-min extension at 72uC. The second PCR run started with denaturing for 5 min at 94uC, followed by 10 cycles of 1 min at 94uC, 1 min at 65 to 56uC with 21uC per cycle for each successive cycle and 1 min 30 s of elongation at 72uC; then started again with 23 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 56uC, 1 min at 72uC and 10 min 72uC elongation [5] . The second PCR product was analyzed on agarose gel. DNA fragments from the gel were extracted with the QIAquick get extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, we performed clone sequencing. The full workflow is shown in Figure 1 . Using Geneious v4.8.3 (www.geneious.com) we calibrated the fragment sequences manually and blasted them online. With the information obtained, and knowing the position of each fragment, we designed 12 pairs of primers using Primer Premier 5.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International) to determine the whole genome of CHIK ( Table 2 ). The 59 terminals of the viral RNA segments were determined with a RACE Kit (Life Technologies). The whole genome of CHIK was assembled and aligned with 154 additional sequences downloaded from GenBank by Geneious. Dataset-specific models that were selected using the Akaike Information Criterion in Modeltest 3.7 were analyzed. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was processed in RAxML v7.2.8 [6, 7] . The optimal ML tree and bootstrap percentages (BP) were estimated in the same run. The ML BP values were obtained from 1000 bootstrap replicates using the rapid bootstrap algorithm.",

Our findings are consistent with the results shown in the phylogenetic tree, which this isolate shares its greatest identity with Indonesia/0706aTw/2007, a strain import-ed to Taiwan from Indonesia. The Zhejiang isolate was distributed inside the Southeast Asian clade that was initially spread from India ( Figure 3 ). Because it was an imported case, transmission of the virus carried by the travelers was monitored. We believe that the infections originated in Indonesia or Malaysia rather than in China. No other local close contacts were found to be infected. Our ML tree indicated that this infection was phylogenetically greatly distant from the viruses detected in Guangdong, China, in 2008 and 2010, as they were derived from another CHIK lineage.",

Some strains previously detected in China during 2008 to 2010 showed an alanine-to-valine substitution in E1 the gene [3, 9] . This variant was first identified on La Reunion (IMTSSA6424C/2005). The region was known to be involved in viral entry via fusion with endosomal membranes [2, 10, 11] . Viruses that carry substitutions may be able to better adapt to the vector, Aedes albopictus, another species of mosquito [1, 2, 12] . Whether the A226V variants followed the same migration path, however, remains uncertain, since it was the only genotype observed during the first outbreak on La Reunion from March to June, 2005, and in Kerala and other Indian regions in 2006 [10, 11] . As CHIK has developed several genetic lineages throughout the African-Asian region, local outbreaks of sporadic strains have arisen according to this geographic pattern [1] . Adaptation of RNA viruses to a new host or vector species often results in the emergence of new viral lineages. Relative genetic variation and isolation allows local strains to evolve independently and to maintain unique genes/ alleles as is required for genetic adaptation to local environments under natural selection [13] . As more imported viruses emerge and are detected in China, more detailed molecular epidemiology data are needed to further understand, monitor and evaluate the threats to this region.",

            "text": "A modified workflow using cDNA-AFLP for virus discovery There are a variety of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms that challenge our health, some of them newly evolved and unknown to date. Identification of these microorganisms is of vital importance in the field of medical care. Several methods have been developed to meet this demand, but disadvantages and drawbacks of the available techniques are evident when new and unknown viruses are encountered [5] . Universal PCR primers, for example, may limit the possibility of identifying a member of an unexpected family. Random priming PCR assays may fail in the face of serious sample contamination. Disadvantage of represen-tational difference analysis is that it needs a negative control tissue from the same source from where the diseased tissue was obtained. The costs for virus detection using new generation sequencing methods are still much higher than traditional procedures. Classical virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP methods was developed and has proved to be a general, simple and easy to use method for detecting viruses on a large scale [14, 15, 16] . A novel human coronavirus was first identified using this classical cDNA-AFLP method [15] . In this study, we therefore modified the classic technique in an attempt to improve accuracy in the hunt for viral segments and to determine the entire genome sequence of viruses. Our reworked modified method involves two steps: sample preprocessing, including WGA and ethanol precipitation for purification; and library construction using Platinum Taq for substitutions. We added quality control steps, such as concentration testing and absorbance detection, to insure sample concentration as well. In some circumstances, this modified method is suitable for determining an unrecognized viral agent in samples from patients of great medical interest or novel viral pathogens. To remove the cells, cell debris and insoluble particles such as mucus, clinical samples should be centrifuged and filtrated with filter membrane. Clinical samples will be tested though our modified virus discovery method in the next study.",
