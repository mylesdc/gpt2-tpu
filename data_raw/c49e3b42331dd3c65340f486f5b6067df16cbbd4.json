However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarraybased species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.

In the most general approach, shotgun sequencing is used to both identify and quantify individual sequences in a sample of interest [5] [6] [7] [8] . In a more targeted approach, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a particular subset of sequences, which can then be cloned and analyzed. For example, 16S rRNA sequences are frequently used to identify bacterial and archaeal species [9] [10] [11] [12] . Another approach is based on functional screening of shotgun expression libraries to identify DNA fragments that encode proteins with desirable activities [13] [14] [15] .",

First, the sequence space to explore may be very large, especially in the case of environmental samples. Given the technologic constraints on the total number of probes that can be placed on a microarray, improved algorithms are required for optimal probe selection to maximize coverage. Second, microarray data generated in metagenomic studies can be very complex. In the case of viral diagnostics, nucleic acid extracted from clinical specimens usually contains host and bacterial contaminants in addition to viral RNA and DNA. As a result, hybridization patterns are complicated by substantial amounts of noise introduced by specific and nonspecific cross-hybridization that cannot be anticipated or controlled. Third, multiple and potentially closely related species may be present in a single sample, resulting in complex or even overlapping hybridization patterns. Finally, a species identification strategy based on the use of experimentally derived patterns alone is not feasible, because such empirical controls can be obtained only for a limited number of species available as pure cultures or genomic clones. New analytical tools capable of overcoming these challenges are acutely needed.",

We defined separation as the difference between the similarity scores of a match and the appropriate nonmatch profiles, divided by the range of all similarity scores on a given microarray.

The best overall separation was determined by calculating the product of the means of the intrafamily and interfamily separations divided by the corresponding standard deviations. Sum normalization of the intensity vectors, quadratic normalization of the energy vectors, and uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric achieved the highest overall separation, producing a mean intrafamily separation of 0.69 (standard deviation 0.17) and a mean interfamily separation of 0.93 (standard deviation 0.08).

To identify incorrect predictions, such as these, resulting from partial profile overlaps with a match virus, we implemented an iterative version of E-Predict in which oligonucleotide intensities corresponding to the top scoring profile from one iteration are set to zero before running the next iteration. As a consequence, misleading predictions resulting from oligonucleotides shared with the top scoring profile fail to attain significant similarity scores in subsequent iterations. Conversely, only those predictions that are based on alternative oligonucleotides, namely predictions representing distinct species, remain. When iterative E-Predict was used on the SARS microarray, no astrovirus or picornavirus profile attained a statistically significant score (P > 0.04) in the second iteration, effectively removing these profiles from consideration.

Only two complete rhinovirus reference genomes are available, one for each group: HRV89 (group A) and HRV14 (group B). Energy profiles of both viruses are included in our energy profile matrix as well as profiles of several enteroviruses and other more distant members of the picornavirus family. RNA samples from cultures of 22 representative serotypes were individually hybridized to the microarray, and the results were analyzed by E-Predict. In the absence of complete genome sequence data and corresponding energy profiles for each of the 22 serotypes, the E-Predict results revealed whether a particular serotype was most similar to HRV89, HRV14, or one of the enterovirus genomes in the energy matrix. To further refine our analysis, we clustered the E-Predict similarity scores from all 22 microarrays across all picornavirus profiles (Figure 4a ).

Existing methods have utilized direct visual inspection of hybridizing oligonucleotides [23, 37] or inspection following clustering [19, 38] . Such methods are intractable for interpreting complex hybridization patterns, are time consuming, and suffer from user bias. Improved data interpretation tools must address several challenges. First, hybridization patterns may represent signal from dozens or even hundreds of species. Also, several closely related species may be present in a sample, giving rise to overlapping hybridization signals. A likely additional source of noise is unanticipated cross-hybridization, because many of the genomes present in a complex sample may be uncharacterized. Finally, obtaining pure samples of each possible species for the purpose of generating reference hybridization patterns is impractical or impossible in most cases.",

In this setting, it is important to distinguish between true predictions representing unique species present in the sample and misleading predictions arising from partially overlapping profiles. In each iteration it is assumed that the profile attaining the highest score corresponds to the species most likely to be among those present in the sample. When a novel species is present, this assumption may not hold because of limited oligonucleotide coverage. For instance, in the SARS CoV example, although SARS CoV attained a higher similarity score than mink astrovirus, the corresponding P values were comparable. However, even if mink astrovirus were the top prediction in the first iteration, SARS CoV would be the top prediction in the second iteration (P = 2 \u00d7 10 -6 ; data not shown) and therefore would not be missed as a true positive. In our current studies P values in all iterations are estimated using the same set of null probability distributions. In addition, we use two iterations as our default, and essentially never need to run more than three iterations, because detection of more than two or three viruses is rare. However, iterative resolution of hundreds or thousands of species present in a sample may necessitate other normalization methods or adjustments to the null distributions for P value estimation. As an alternative, noniterative algorithms for analyzing overlapping profile signatures are also being explored.",

            "text": "In conclusion, E-Predict is a novel computational approach for species identification, which is generally applicable to a wide range of metagenomic applications using DNA microarrays. In particular, as more sequencing efforts are being directed at natural microbial communities, DNA microarrays are bound to become a central tool for various downstream applications such as identification of microbial species or detection of genes and biochemical pathways in such communities. E-Predict addresses an acute need for computational tools that are capable of interpreting the highly complex microarray data obtained through such studies. E-Predict was developed for viral species identification and therefore has immediate implications for medical diagnostics and viral discovery. In addition, the concept of theoretical energy profiles can be extended to represent other microorganisms, particular genes, or biochemical pathways.",

Only a small number of profiles (34) required trimming beyond 10%, all of which corresponded to viruses frequently present in our samples. No profile required trimming of more than 17% of the scores.

A training set of 32 microarrays was used to evaluate all nonequivalent combinations of intensity and energy vector normalization (N, none; Q, quadratic; S, sum; U, unit-vector) and similarity metric (DP, dot product; ED, similarity based on Euclidean distance; PC, Pearson correlation; SR, Spearman rank correlation; UP, uncentered Pearson correlation) parameters. For each combination of parameters, intrafamily and interfamily separations were calculated for each microarray as the score of the virus profile matching the virus present in the sample minus the score of the best scoring nonmatch profile from the same or a different virus family (top and bottom panels, respectively), normalized by the range of all scores on that microarray. Bars represent the mean, and error bars represent the standard deviation (\u00b1) of separation values from all microarrays. The best performing combinations are shown in order of increasing performance (calculated as the product of the intrafamily and interfamily separation means divided by the corresponding standard deviations). Estimation of significance of individual similarity scores. Probabilities associated with the similarity scores of nine representative virus profiles obtained for the 15 HeLa, 10 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and seven influenza A virus (FluA) microarrays from the training dataset are shown in the top, center, and bottom panels, respectively. Each circle represents one microarray, and vertical 'jitter' is used to resolve individual circles.Probabilities for virus profiles from seven diverse virus families are included with each microarray set: herpes simplex virus (HSV)1; human Tlymphotropic virus (HTLV)1; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV); human rhinovirus B (HRV)B; FluA; human RSV; and three human papillomaviruses (HPV)18. Red circles represent match and black circles nonmatch interfamily profiles. Two intrafamily nonmatch profiles are also included and are different for the three microarray sets. The most closely related intrafamily profiles are represented by purple circles: HPV45, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza B virus (FluB). More distant intrafamily profiles are shown in blue: HPV37, mumps virus (MuV), and influenza C virus (FluC).The inset in each panel shows a normalized histogram (density) of the empirical distribution of logtransformed similarity scores for a match profile (black curve) and the corresponding normal fit representing true negative scores (green curve). Inset red bars depict observed log-transformed similarity scores corresponding to the match profile probabilities (red circles).",

E-Predict similarity scores were obtained for all virus profiles in the energy matrix and clustered using average linkage hierarchical clustering and Pearson correlation as the similarity metric. Virus profiles for which similarity scores could be calculated in all 22 experiments were included in the clustering. Both microarrays (rows) and virus profiles (columns) were clustered. (b) Published nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein from the 22 HRV serotypes were aligned using ClustalX. Phylogenetic tree based on the resulting alignment is shown.",
