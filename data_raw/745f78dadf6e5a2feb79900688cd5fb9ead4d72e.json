            "text": "This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-parasitic effect of ursolic acid against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) that induces toxoplasmosis, particularly in humans. The anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against T. gondii-infected cells and T. gondii were evaluated through different specific assays, including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing. Ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii when compared with sulfadiazine, and consistently induced anti-T. gondii activity/effect. In particular, the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid, which was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the survival rate of T. gondii was strongly inhibited in T. gondii group treated with ursolic acid, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) against T. gondii was measured as 94.62 \u00b5g/mL. The T. gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-T. gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of T. gondii through the direct and the selective T. gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of T. gondii-infected mice. This study shows that ursolic acid has the potential to be used as a promising anti-T. gondii candidate substance for developing effective anti-parasitic drugs.",

T. gondii not only induces chronic infection in various sites of human body, but it also causes brain infection through the central nervous system as zoonotic parasitosis. In addition, T. gondii has unique infectious subcellular organelles, including apicoplast, conoid, rhoptries, dense granules, and micronemes [1] . In general, T. gondii forms a unique proliferative membrane, such as a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) including reticular network (RN) during its proliferation after invasion into host cells, and grows in it [2] . Until recently, several drugs were developed to inhibit T. gondii, and they are being used to treat toxoplasmosis' patients in the clinic. However, their side effects are still clear in the clinic, and it is also being exposed to drug-resistance gradually [3] [4] [5] . In these aspects, pyrimethamine used for treating toxoplasmosis blocks the synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by effectively inhibiting the dihydrofolate reductase in T. gondii, which inhibits consistently synthesis of the DNA and/or RNA in the proliferation of protozoa species, including malaria.",

We evaluated the anti-parasitic activity and the effects of UA on the proliferation and growth of T. gondii using an MTT assay and UA showed the anti-T. gondii activity in the range of 25-200 \u00b5g/mL. T. gondii-infected cells were incubated with different concentrations \u00b5g/mL) of UA for 24 h, and their viability was markedly decreased in a dose dependent manner (Tables 1 and 2 ). In addition, the UA effectively inhibited the proliferation and growth of T. gondii-infected cells as compared with SF. In particular, T. gondi-infected cells treated with UA (100 \u00b5g/mL) showed a significant decrease of T. gondii including T. gondii fragmentation as well as morphological changes such as cell shrinkage and cell fragmentation when compared with the untreated T. gondii-infected cells (Data not shown), which suggests that UA has anti-parasitic activity and the inhibitory effect against T. gondi in infected cells (Table 2) . Furthermore, the UA effectively inhibited the viability of the parasite through the direct inhibition of T. gondii when compared with SF, which is to strongly demonstrate its selective inhibitory effect against T. gondii, and then the parasitic SR was measured at less than 45% at concentrations of 100 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 1 ). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of UA against T. gondii and T. gondii-infected cells was measured as 94.62 \u00b5g/mL and 162.25 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. These results demonstrate that UA strongly induced anti-proliferation activity of T. gondii in the infected host cells by effectively blocking T. gondii as well as the direct inhibitory action against T. gondii.

The mice were carefully observed during the experimental periods after the injection of T. gondii treated with 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcg/mL of UA for 24 h. As mentioned above, T. gondii-infected mice treated with different concentrations (200 and 400 \u03bcg/mL) of UA showed higher activity and viability than T. gondii-infected mice, and the mice indicated the dynamic and energetic activity as the normal group. In particular, it clearly confirmed T. gondii induces infectious symptoms and diseases, such as lymphadenopathy and brain injury, particularly in human as a zoonotic parasite that is infected in both human and animals.

In particular, it clearly confirmed a significant difference of the survival rate between T. gondii-infected mice and the infected mice treated with UA. However, T. gondii-infected mice treated with 100 \u00b5g/mL of UA showed that the effect of UA did not consistently maintain the survival of the infected mice by decreasing after 11.8 days. This result suggests that the death of mice may be owing to tissue damage and cytolysis by invasion of T. gondii than the loss of body weight of mice. Furthermore, symptoms and side effects, such as the loss of body weight, were not observed or induced in all of the groups treated with 200 and 400 \u00b5g/mL of UA for the experimental periods ( Figure 3 ). The result shows effective and clear evidence regarding the effect of anti-T. gondii compounds, which indicates clarity regarding the results as a fusion method for both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". These results demonstrate that UA has the selective anti-parasitic activity which strongly causes anti-T. gondii effects as well as suppressing their viability by effectively inhibiting T. gondii.

In this aspect, T. gondii not only inhibits defensive mechanisms of cytokines, such as IL-2, -4, -6, -8, and IFN-\u03b3 released from host cells after invasion, but also suppresses the production of protective systems that are activated through the immune-response. Furthermore, it is known to block the signaling transport pathways that activate anti-parasitic system and the resistance to T. gondii invasion in host cells, as well as to suppress the apoptotic signals and cell arrest pathways during the early apoptotic stage of host cells after cell invasion [32, 33] . Moreover, T. gondii promotes inactivation of cell cycle initiators and apoptotic mediators during the proliferative phase of T. gondii by forming PVM of T. gondii in host cells, which rapidly accelerates the proliferation of T. gondii in PVM [34] .",

On the other hand, the proliferation of T. gondii and PVM were markedly inhibited in T. gondii-infected cells treated with UA compared with T. gondii-infected cells. In addition, we evaluated the anti-T. gondii activity of UA through T. gondii-infected mice. After the injection of T. gondii treated with UA (200 and 400 \u00b5g/mL), the mice showed the vitality and the viability such as the uninfected control group without the loss of body weight and the cytotoxicity during the experiment. In particular, it was recently reported that UA has the anti-protozoa effects against Leishmania amazonesis and Leishmania infantums, causing leishmaniasis among the neglected tropical diseases, and its mechanism of action is associated with programmed cell death and nitric oxide (NO) production [35, 36] . In this aspect, the anti-T. gondii effect of UA suggests that UA may induce the anti-proliferation and the growth inhibitory action of T. gondii through the mechanism of action that is caused by nitric oxide (NO) production or programmed cell death in T. gondii and the infected host cells.",
