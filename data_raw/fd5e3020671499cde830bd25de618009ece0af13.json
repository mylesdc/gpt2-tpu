Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using antisense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 39 or 59 untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect.",

Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment.",

Among these, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are categorized as emerging global pathogens [2] . JEV is a mosquitoborne, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus, responsible for frequent epidemics of encephalitis, predominantly in children, in most parts of Southeast Asia and adjoining regions. It is the causal factor for 30,000-50,000 cases of encephalitis occurring every year and accounts for about 10,000 deaths annually with serious neurological squeal in the survivors [3] . JEV has been expanding its 'geographical footprint' into previously non-endemic regions and with several billion people at risk, Japanese encephalitis (JE) represents an internationally emerging concern in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Currently three types of JE vaccine are in use-the inactivated mouse-brain derived, the inactivated cellculture derived and the live attenuated cell-culture derived. However, there are limitations for their usage in terms of availability, cost and safety [4] . At present, chemotherapy against JEV is largely supportive and not targeted towards the virus. A lot of avenues has been explored in the past and are also being currently tried, so as to develop a safe and effective molecule that would be able to prevent the virus from replicating within the host.",

The ORF encodes a polyprotein which is processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural and seven non structural proteins [5, 6] . The 59 and 39 UTRs of the JEV genome contain conserved sequence elements and can form conserved stem loop structure. 59 UTR contain secondary structures which are required for the formation of translation pre-initiation complex [7] . JEV requires long range RNA-RNA interaction between 59 and 39 regions of its genome for efficient replication; one such interaction occurs between a pair of 10 complementary nucleotides, located in coding sequence for the capsid protein at 136-146 nucleotides from 59 end of the genome, and 39 cyclization sequence, commonly denoted as 39CSI (39 conserved sequence I) located at 104-114 nucleotides from 39 end of the genome [8, 9] . The 39CSI is highly conserved across members of JEV serocomplex, indicating the possibility that RNA elements within the 59 and 39 UTRs in JEV genome are essential for its replication.",

Vivo-Morpholino are specialized type of non-peptide Morpholino oligomers, conjugated with a new transport structure that provides effective delivery into a wide variety of tissues in living animals, thereby raising the possibilities of their use as therapeutic agents. The transporter comprises of a dendritic structure assembled around a triazine core which serves to position eight guanidinium head groups in a conformation effective to penetrate cell membranes. Vivo-Morpholinos have also been shown to effectively enter and function within cultured cells [18] . Vivo-Morpholinos are also cost effective, non immunogenic, and stable under physiological conditions as compared to other types of Morpholinos. This study was designed to evaluate whether the use of Vivo-Morpholinos as therapeutic agents, is possible in an experimental model of JE.

The threat of JE looms over a vast geographical realm, encompassing approximately 10 billion people. The disease is feared because currently there are no specific antiviral drugs available. There have been reports where other investigators have shown that agents that block viral replication can be used as effective therapeutic countermeasures. Vivo-Morpholinos (MOs) are synthetically produced analogs of DNA or RNA that can be modified to bind with specific targeted regions in a genome. In this study the authors propose that in an animal model of JE, MOs specifically designed to bind with specific region of JE virus (JEV) genome, blocks virus production in cells of living organisms. This results in reduced mortality of infected animals. As the major target of JEV is the nerve cells, analysis of brain of experimental animals, post treatment with MOs, showed neuroprotection. Studies in cultured cells were also supportive of the antiviral role of the MOs. The potent anti-sense effect in animals and lack of obvious toxicity at the effective dosage make these MOs good research reagents with future therapeutic applications in JE.",

Initially each group contained 8 animals. Animals belonging to all groups except Sham were infected with 3610 5 plaque forming units (PFU) of JEV (GP78 strain) and that day was considered as day zero [20] . Animals of Sham group received equal volume of filtered MEM. Starting from 3 h post infection on day zero, 100 mg of SC-MO, 39 MO and 59 MO, diluted in 0.1 mL of sterile 16PBS (corresponding to 5 mg/kg body weight), were administered to animals belonging to JEV+SC-MO, JEV+39 MO and JEV+59 MO groups respectively, once per day, for 5 consecutive days. Animals belonging to the Sham-treatment group received equal volumes of sterile 16 PBS only. Survivality of animals in each group following JEV infection and Morpholino treatment were monitored daily upto 15 days post JEV infection (or till their death, whichever was earlier). Toxicity of the Morpholinos in mice was evaluated by weight loss and abnormal behavioral & clinical observations (including tremors, ruffled fur, hunching, ataxia, gait abnormalities), in a masked manner to minimize bias [14, 20] .",

            "text": "Morpholino oligomers are single stranded anti-sense molecules that exert their action by steric blocking of complementary RNA. Unlike other types of anti-sense oligonucleotides, Morpholinos provide all the desired properties of stability, nuclease resistance, high efficacy, long-term activity, water solubility, low toxicity, and exquisite specificity. Morpholino oligomers has been used previously for the inhibition of flaviviral replication [14, 27] including JEV [15] though all of them has utilized peptide based Morpholinos. The peptide based Morpholinos contain delivery moiety evolved from natural peptides whose active components are 6-9 arginine residues in a bio-available 6-aminohexanoicspaced structure [28] . However, these arginine-based peptides are not commercially available for research purposes and their greatest efficacies have been in delivering Morpholinos to the cytosol of tissues like liver [29] or leaky muscle [30] , which would be considered as easily deliverable. As a result, the reach of peptide based Morpholinos into a wide spectrum of tissues remains questionable [18] . Also, owing to the peptidic nature, degradation of the peptide portion of the conjugates was found to be time and tissue dependent [31] . Furthermore, the applications of the arginine-rich peptide transporters are limited due to their high cost, scalability and stability. Added to that are the risks of immune responses against the peptides which limits repeated administrations for diseases requiring long-term treatment [32] . Increases were observed in the ROS levels in the brain samples of JEVinfected and JEV+SC-MO groups in comparison to Sham, that were reduced following 39 and 59 MO treatments. Although ROS levels were decreased in JEV+39 MO group when compared to JEV-infected group, it remained significantly higher than that in Sham (A). Approximately 13-fold increases were observed in the levels of HSP-70 in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups as compared to Sham. These drastic increases were significantly reduced in JEV+39 MO and JEV+59 MO groups, the levels remained significantly higher than Sham (B&C). SOD-1 levels were found to be elevated 2and nearly 3-fold in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups respectively compared to Sham. 39 and 59 MO treatment caused significant reduction of SOD-1 levels compared to JEV-infected group (B&D). Alterations in TRX-1 levels were similar to that observed in SOD-1 except that its level in JEV+ SC-MO was not significantly different than only JEV-infected group (B&E). Nearly 2-fold increases were observed in NO levels of JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to those obtained from Sham. NO levels were subsequently reduced to significantly lower levels following 39 and 59MO treatments (F). iNOS expression was found to increase 8-fold in JEV-infected and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham. Following 39 and 59MO treatments iNOS levels decreased significantly as compared to JEV-infected group (G&H). ( * p,0.01 for JEV when compared to Sham; ** p,0.01 for JEV+SC-MO when compared to JEV-infected only; # p,0.01 for JEV+ 39MO To minimize the problems encountered by the peptideconjugated Morpholinos, octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino oligomers have been developed that are commonly referred to as Vivo-Morpholino (MO). These custom-sequence anti-sense molecules have been reported to enable Morpholino applications in adult animals. MO was our choice of anti-sense molecule as this enabled us to test the specifically designed oligonucleotides in both animal as well as cell culture models. Though 'outstanding' results have been reported to be achieved by intravenous (i.v.) administration of the MO, we preferred the intraperitoneal route via which modest systemic delivery can be achieved. This was so done because brain has been reported to be an ineffective tissue when MOs are administered i.v. [33] , though there is no direct evidence showing that MOs can cross blood brain barrier, when administered via other routes. According to the manufacturer's (Gene Tools LLC) instructions the maximum suggested dosage in mammals is 12.5 mg/kg in a 24 hour period. Our aim was to determine the minimum dose at which our desired effects could be achieved. Initially we had chosen two doses of 5 mg and 10 mg per kg body weight (b.w.) of the animals. We found that there was no significant difference between the survival rate of JEV-infected and MO treated mice in either dose (data not shown for 10 mg/kg b.w.). The survival rate was approximately 90% in those JEV-infected animals that were treated with 39 MO and 75% in animals treated with 59 MO. Thus we decided to proceed with the 5 mg/kg b.w. dose for all subsequent experiments.",

            "text": "Plaque assay from the brain homogenates of animals of all groups revealed that the number of infective viral particle production was dramatically reduced following 39 and 59 MO treatment. The 39 MO was generated against the 39 CSI region of the JEV genome that interacts with 59 CS region located in coding sequence for capsid protein at 136-146 nucleotides from 59 terminal of the genome. This interaction results in cyclization of JEV genome that is necessary for its efficient replication. The 59 MO was targeted towards one of the secondary structures of the 59 UTR that are required for the formation of translation preinitiation complex. Blocking of these two sites in the JEV genome leads to the most likely effect, i.e. inhibition of replication and translation of viral genome. This was further corroborated by the decrease in the expressions of viral proteins (NS5, E glycoprotein Vivo-Morpholino in Japanese Encephalitis www.plosntds.org and general flaviviral envelop protein) in the brain. Flaviviral NS5 is known to possess guanylyltransferase activity that helps in the synthesis of methylated cap structure at the 59 end of the viral genome that plays a crucial role in the translation and stability of mRNAs [34] . The JEV E glycoprotein is believed to be involved in viral adhesion and entry into host cells, hemagglutination, cellular tropism, viral virulence, and the induction of protective immune responses [35] . Decreased expression of these proteins indicates that viral replication and production of new infective viral particles are inhibited due to the MOs. Immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen also provided visual confirmation of the fact that JEV antigen was detected at much lower amounts in the brain following MO treatment. However, these data does not prove that MOs directly inhibit infective viral particle production in the brain itself, as it cannot be conclusively stated whether the MOs can reach brain. These data merely suggests that the number of replication-competent infective JEV in the brain was significantly reduced, which subsequently leads to neuroprotection.",

Since there was reduction in the production of infective viral particles following 39 and 59 MO treatments, we studied the effect on microglial pathophysiology in mouse brain. Our results show that there was significantly reduced number of activated microglia in the brain sections of both 39 and 59 MO-treated animals as compared to only JEV-infected or JEV-infected and SC-MO treated animals. Since there were little or no activation of microglia, proinflammatory cytokine levels in the brain were found to be significantly downregulated. Histochemical staining also revealed that neuronal population and morphology remained largely unaffected in 39 and 59 MO-treated animals' brains as compared to only JEV-infected or JEV-infected and SC-MO treated animals.",

Increase in ROS levels initiates various responses within the cell, including damage to proteins, DNA and lipid [36] . In this study, ROS levels were found to be many-fold increased in JEV-infected or JEV-infected and SC-MO treated animals that were then found to be counteracted by the treatment of 39 and 59 MO. The levels of stress related proteins such as SOD-1, HSP-70 and TRX where also found to be positively modulated following 39 and 59 MO treatment. NO is a known antagonist of JEV. It has been shown that NO inhibits JEV infection by preventing viral replication [37] . In our study NO levels were increased in the brain in response to JEV infection possibly due to the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Treatments with 39 and 59 MO caused a decrease of NO to basal levels as observed in Sham-treated animals.",

JEV is known to activate pNFkb via a PI3K-dependent pathway in the brain of infected animals, which is associated with apoptosis [38] . JEV infection has also been shown to activate stress kinases, which in turn results in activation of ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathway leading to apoptotic death of neurons [39] . In accordance with the established results, here also we found that there was similar activation pattern of these molecules in JEV-infected and JEVinfected and SC-MO treated animal brain samples. Treatment with the MOs resulted in abrogation of those changes that led to greater survivality of brain neurons as observed by histochemical staining. Activation of p38MAPK is also related to the transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes in the brain [40] . Thus the decrease in phophoP38 MAPK levels correlates with the decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokine levels in obtained from the brain.",

There have been studies regarding the anti-JEV effects of other types of Morpholino oligomers though none of them are yet to be considered for therapeutic purposes. This is the first study that investigates the role of Morpholino oligomers specially designed for effective delivery into live animal models. Generally, the i.p route of administration of any drug is preferred in animal studies over any other routes. However, the efficacy of these antisense molecules needs to be checked by administering through other applicable routes, as i.p. administration in humans is uncommon, though not unheard of. The amounts of oligomers required and the route of administration in this study marks these molecules as practicable therapeutic agents in JE, though further studies are required before these can be recommended for clinical trials. Figure S1 MO treatments decrease viral load in vitro. Mouse neuroblastoma cell (N2a) lysates from all the treatment groups were subjected to plaque assay in order to determine viral loads. PFU/mL was found to be significantly higher in both JEV and JEV+SC-MO groups when compared to Sham. Viral loads were found to be significantly reduced in both JEV+39 MO and JEV+59 MO groups when compared to only JEV-infected group (* p , 0.01 for JEV and JEV+SC-MO when compared to Sham; # p , 0.01 for JEV+39 MO and JEV+59MO when compared to only JEV-infected group) (A). Intracellular staining for JEV antigen in N2a was performed and number of JEV-positive N2a cells was then sorted by flow cytometry. 30% of the total gated cells were found to be positive for JEV antigen in JEV-infected group as compared to 34% in JEV+SC-MO group. Only 16% and 9% of the total gated cells were found to be positive for JEV antigen in JEV+39 MO and JEV+59 MO groups respectively (B). Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000892.s001 (0.25 MB TIF)",
