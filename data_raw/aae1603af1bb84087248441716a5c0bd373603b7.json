Although overall mortality associated with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09) infection was considered low, individuals at risk of complications were identified, such as immunocompromised individuals that included HIV-infected [2, 3] . As a prevention strategy, vaccination was recommended to HIV-infected individuals following the same recommendations for healthy individuals [4, 5] . However, there was uncertainty regarding the best vaccination schedule for patients with impaired immunity [6, 7] . Although few studies have explored modified vaccination regimens for this population, further studies are needed to evaluate vaccine dosage and number of applications, and novel adjuvants [8] .",

Statistical significance of differences between proportions was assessed using the chi-squared test. Comparison of means was based on the t-test.

Similarly, seroprotection increased from 71% and 76% after the first dose to 84% and 88% after the second dose of the same vaccination schemes. These percentages of seroconversion are comparable to those found by Soonawala et al [19] in a smaller and non-randomized study and lower than the seroconversions found by Bickel [6] and Launay [7] who enrolled asymptomatic, HIV-infected adults in Germany and France. In these studies, most patients' characteristics were comparable to those from our study population (ie, high mean baseline CD4 cell count). In contrast, although HAART was used by almost 80% of our patients, undetectable viral load was observed in roughly 65% and 40% had a previous AIDS-defining illness. That is, in comparison to the other studies cited above, our study population had more advanced disease. In addition, a different pattern of H1N1pdm09 virus circulation in the northern and southern hemispheres in 2009/2010 may hamper the comparison of our seroconversion results with those of others [6, 7, 19] . Studies from the northern hemisphere enrolled patients from November to December of 2009, which overlapped with the second wave of the H1N1pdm09 pandemic in these locations [20] . Since circulating and vaccine strains of H1N1pdm09 virus were virtually the same, sub-clinical infection with the circulating viruses may have boosted the immune response in individuals from the northern hemisphere, leading to [20] . In fact, the Brazilian surveillance system detected influenza A H3N2 and B circulation in 2010, but no concomitant H1N1pdm09 circulation [20] . Thus, there was minimal H1N1pdm09 circulation during our study and, conse-quently, immune boosts due to virus circulation were unlikely. In our study, one third of the HIV-infected participants had seroprotective antibody titers at baseline. This value is higher than that observed in other H1N1pdm09 studies conducted in the northern hemisphere [6, 7] , corroborating the high H1N1pdm09 circulation in 2009 in Brazil [9] . Table 3 .

These results are consistent with other reports of decreased sustained antibody response among HIVinfected adults [21] . Data on the durability of influenza antibodies after seasonal vaccination for the general population suggest that protection lasts for at least one year [22, 23] . For the HIV-infected population, very limited data is available as most studies only report 30-days of follow-up. Sustainability of antibody response is important since the influenza season often spans an estimated six months [24] . Furthermore, pandemic influenza infections may occur during non-seasonal months necessitating prolonged immunity [25] . Our study shows that a higher proportion of the patients who received two double doses were able to sustain protective antibody responses at six months. Thus, our data suggest that a modified vaccination schedule may confer higher sustained seroprotection. This finding has important implications for both HIV care and public health policy.",

Although more glycosylated than those from 1918 and 2009, viruses from the 1970s are also more similar to these agents than to viruses that circulated in 1990/2000 that are heavily glycosylated. Therefore, previous exposure to viruses from the 1970s could confer cross-immunity to H1N1pdm09. Consequently, it is possible that vaccination against H1N1pdm09 could have boosted an existing immunity to low glycosylated hemagglutinins, which is more likely to be present in participants aged .40 years.",

Fifteen participants had at least one respiratory virus detected, but no H1N1pdm09 cases were found. The vaccine was well tolerated in our study population. Local pain and fever, which were the most frequent Limitations of our study should be acknowledged. This was a single-center study, with entry criteria limited to those patients without current comorbidities, and conducted over a single H1N1pdm09 season. We evaluated a well controlled cohort of HIV-infected individuals and, thus, could not determine the impact of current severe immunosuppression on H1N1pdm09 vaccine responses. However, our study had the advantage of concurrently evaluating a group of HIV-uninfected controls and a significant proportion of women. Our study provides compelling evidence for the need of a different vaccination scheme for HIVinfected individuals. A higher vaccine dose would provide additional benefits for women and for those with a history of advanced immunodeficiency.",

The 21-days interval between doses was more important in inducing higher seroconversion than the vaccine hemagglutinin dosage. Patients with nadir CD4 cell counts ,200 and women showed improved seroconversion with double doses, which also provided more sustained seroprotection. Our findings contribute to the planning of next year's influenza vaccination campaign also by suggesting that if the vaccine is used at the currently recommended dosage and schedule, a significant proportion of the individuals will remain vulnerable to influenza.",
