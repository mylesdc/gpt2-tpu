Up to now, eleven genotypes have been identified however, their clinical significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated the presence of SAFV in asymptomatic patients admitted for adenoidectomy. A total of 70 adenoid tissue samples were collected from children with clinical symptoms caused by hypertrophy of adenoids but without symptoms of airway infection. Samples were investigated for SAFV by RT-nested PCR and sequence analysis. Eleven of 70 (15.7%) samples were positive for SAFV. Nasopharyngeal swabs were available from 45 children just before surgery. SAFV was rarely found and only in children with SAFV-positive adenoids 2/8. Our findings indicate that the presence of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue than expected. This could support the notion of a longer than previously anticipated persistence of SAFV nucleic acids in the respiratory tract and possibly a chronic infection. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of SAFV infection in humans.",

SAFV is a small non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA of about 8,050 nucleotides. Up to now, eleven different SAFV genotypes have been identified (http://www.picornaviridae.com/). SAFV-1 has initially been isolated from a fecal specimen of an 8-month-old girl with fever of unknown origin [1] . Following this observation, SAFV was detected frequently in nasal a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 specimens of children with respiratory infections (0.2%-24%, [5] ) and stool samples from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis (0.2%-3%, [5] ) [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Due to these findings, SAFV was supposed to be a relevant new human pathogen, especially in children. According to antibody seroprevalence studies, SAFV infection is highly common and occurs early in life, with approximately 80% of seropositive children at the age of 2 years [14] [15] [16] . SAFV is spread worldwide [1, 3-4, 6, 9-10, 12-17] .",

Besides respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, the disease spectrum may involve type 1 diabetes and neurological disorders [7, 17] . Furthermore, the virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from children with exudative tonsillitis (9/37, [18] ) and in autopsy samples from myocardium, lung and blood from a child with myocarditis [19] . Additionally, the virus was found in feces from Asian children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [9] and in cerebrospinal fluid specimens of patients with aseptic meningitis [12, [20] [21] . This is of particular importance, because other members of the Cardiovirus B species are neurotropic. E. g., TMEV is known to cause a multiple sclerosis (MS)-like syndrome in mice [21] . However, there are also reports i) describing SAFV detection with similar percentages in healthy and diseased individuals, e.g., in stool samples [9, [22] [23] and, ii) reports failing to detect SAFV in samples from diseased patients, e.g., in cerebrospinal fluid from individuals with aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and MS [24] [25] , and, finally, iii) reports co-detecting SAFV with common gastroenteritis pathogens in stool samples in case of diarrhea [22] .

Zhang and colleagues [27] collected 352 throat swabs from asymptomatic children, aged 4 to 78 months. In contrast to our results, these authors did not detect any SAFV positives among the asymptomatic children while 25/1829 (1.37%) swabs from children with respiratory symptoms were positive. The authors applied the same RT-PCR protocol as we did. Except for that particular study sampling oropharyngeal specimens, as we did, all other information on healthy children is derived from analysis of feces. Drexler and colleagues [12] did not detect SAFV-RNA in stool samples from 39 control children while the detection rate in children with diarrhea was 0.7% (6/844). In contrast to these two studies [12, 27] reporting absence of SAFV in asymptomatic children, there are three reports describing a similar or an even higher prevalence of SAFV in feces from healthy children compared to children with gastrointestinal illness (2.8% vs. 1.5% [22] ; 2.8% vs. 2.6% [23] ) or nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (12.2% vs. 8.8% [9] ). Our results demonstrating presence of SAFV in non-diseased individuals might be consistent with the results of these three studies, although the body site where the specimens were collected was quite different. Surprisingly, detection of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue (15.7%) than in non-tissue specimens from the respiratory tract. In a recent study, SAFV was detected in 9.7% of throat swabs from 226 Taiwanese-children with respiratory symptoms [4] . In a larger cohort of 1,525 children with acute respiratory infections in Japan, SAFV2 was found in 3.5% of nasopharyngeal swabs [28] . In another study from Bejing including 1,558 children, SAFV was detected in 0.6% of nasopharyngeal aspirates from 506 patients with upper respiratory tract infection and in 0.4% of 1,032 patients with lower respiratory tract infections [29] . The hypothesis of a higher SAFV prevalence in adenoid tissue than in non-tissue specimens from the respiratory tract might be underpinned by our results detecting SAFV in 15.7% of adenoid tissue samples vs. 4.4% in throat swabs, although the difference was not statistical significant (p = 0.059), most probably due to the low numbers analyzed. However, there is one study reporting a rather higher rate of SAFV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs (9/37 = 33.3%) taken from children with exudative tonsillitis [18] than we found in the adenoid tissue.",

Enterovirus and Human parechovirus deserve a special mention regarding their belonging to the Picornaviridae family, as does SAFV. Overall, Enterovirus was the most frequent co-detected virus (9/11 (81.8%)), followed by Human bocavirus (7/11 (63.6%)). In the SAFV-negative tissues, both viruses were less frequently found, i.e., Enterovirus in 31/59 (52.54%) and Human bocavirus in 34/59 (57.62%) samples. However, the differences between the SAFV-positive and negative group are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding, the high prevalence of various viruses in adenoid tissue is surprising. One may speculate as to whether children with adenoid hypertrophy requiring adenoidectomy underwent a greater number of infections resulting in a higher rate of tissue-associated viral nucleic acid than children without adenoid hypertrophy. Alternatively, storage of viruses or viral genomes in adenoids might be a general phenomenon in childhood. The finding of DNA and RNA of multiple viruses, at least of fragments, supports the notion of a longer than previously anticipated persistence of viral nucleic acids in adenoids. Sato et al. [30] speculated on a normal viral flora and a chronicity of selected respiratory viruses. Alternatively, viral presence in adenoid tissue might play a role with respect to the immune response. Interestingly, in contrast to adenoid tissue (Table 2) , we rarely found nucleic acid from multiple viruses (> 2) in nasopharyngeal swabs (Table 3) .",

Yet, the authors critically noted that it would need to be checked by looking for the virus in asymptomatic patients in further studies [4] . Although our study focused on asymptomatic individuals, the results of our study do not contribute to the answer of the question about the true clinical significance of SAFV detection. However, our study at least demonstrated that SAFV, and in addition a spectrum of other respiratory viruses, can be detected at a relatively high rate in the adenoids of asymptomatic children. Additional studies with enlarged sample size including both adolescents and adults as well as attempts for SAFV isolation in cell culture are needed to clarify the duration period of SAFV persistence in tissue as well as the virus\u00b4ability for replication in asymptomatic individuals.",
