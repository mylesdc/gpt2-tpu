A high burden of dental caries was evident among children in Saudi Arabia with an estimated prevalence of approximately 80% [2] ; other high-risk areas include Latin America, Middle East, and South Asia [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the need to reduce global burden of dental caries in attaining optimal health. Consequently, in the year 2003, WHO and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) World Dental Federation set global goals for oral health in 2020 to guide planners and policy makers to improve the status of oral health in their populations [4] . Unfortunately, knowledge gaps with respect to the availability of baseline data on oral health and population-specific key modifiable factors of dental caries restrict the ability of many developing nations and semi-developed countries, including Saudi Arabia to attain the goals set by WHO. In addition, competing interests in health care funding warrant prioritizing the associated factors to better direct public health mitigation efforts.",

Moreover, modification of socioeconomic factors requires time-consuming macro level changes. In contrast, individual factors, such as child oral health behaviors, child feeding practices, and dietary habits that play a role in cariogenesis, could be targeted for modification by directing the limited resources to primary school children. Prior evidence illustrates the importance of adopting good oral health behaviors such as regular brushing of teeth, using mouthwash, and flossing teeth in reducing the disease burden and attaining optimal oral health [10] . Similarly, the role of sugary foods (e.g., candies) in cariogenesis was also well established [11] . However, the relative significance of aforementioned oral behavioral factors on cariogenesis compared to other host factors could vary significantly in different populations owing to cultural and behavioral practices.",

In the second step, the associated factors for dental caries among each of the four broader determinants of health, including socioeconomic factors, child oral health behavior and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary factors, were identified based on four separate stepwise logistic regression analyses. Subsequently, the covariates that were significant (p \u2264 0.05) in each of the four analyses were selected for further analysis. In the final step, a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on covariates selected from step two and variable age group of the child (6 or 7 or 8 years) to determine key associated factors for dental caries. In addition, multicollinearity was assessed using collinearity indices, eigenvalues, and variable decomposition proportions for all the multivariate models. One of the highly collinear variables was removed giving precedence to children oral health behavior and practice covariates.

The age-specific prevalence of dental caries among children aged 6, 7, and 8 years was 87.6% (95% CI 82.4-91.6%), 72.9% (95% CI 65.9-79.1%), and 88.4% (95% CI 82.7-92.8%), respectively.

Table 1 provides the frequencies, percentages, and differences (by caries status) for various characteristics of study population. A significant number of fathers (65.7%, 95% CI 61.7-69.6%) and mothers (73.9%, 95% CI 70.1-77.4%) did not attend a college or university, and their children experienced high prevalence of dental caries. Majority of the children came from low-income families (59.7%, 95% CI 55.6-63.7%), and approximately 99% of them experienced dental caries. Most of the study subjects lived in rental homes, and 77% had no dental coverage in medical insurance. In general, the children had poor oral health behavior and practices as most of them started brushing at a late age (5 or more years) and brushed less than once daily (55%) in any given week. The use of dental floss and mouthwash was negligible, and most of the children visited a dentist for symptomatic treatment. Although the practice of breast feeding is common, most of the children were weaned by the first year. The practice of mixed feeding was common in our sample; approximately 81% of mixed-fed children experienced dental caries compared to 93% of children that were exclusively fed with either breast milk or powdered milk. The practice of sleeping with a bottle in mouth and frequent consumption of sugary snacks between meals was also common. The consumption of fresh fruits and fresh juice was less prevalent in our sample.",

In contrast, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from developing nations demonstrated the dominant role of socioeconomic factors in dental caries' experience [18, [27] [28] [29] . The risk profile of dental caries among children in Saudi Arabia appears to follow the theme in developed world, where oral health behavioral practices and dietary habits were relatively more important [30] . However, efforts directed at improving socioeconomic status should be continued, owing to evidence from the present study and prior studies that identified maternal education and family income as consistent associated factors for dental caries [16, 17, 27, 28] . In addition, the availability of dental coverage in medical insurance was associated with dental caries.

            "text": "Our results were consistent with previous studies on dental caries that reported an association between dental caries and good oral health behaviors in general [10, 19] , and tooth brushing habits in particular [31, 32] . A recent meta-analysis identified a 1.5-fold higher risk of dental caries among people brushing less than once daily compared to those brushing regularly (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56; 95% CI 1.37-1.78) [33] . An overwhelming majority of children started brushing after 2 years (82%, 95% CI 78.6-85.1%) in the present study, consistent with late adoption of brushing observed in previous studies in Saudi Arabia [20, 34] and in Philippines [35] . However, the higher risk of dental caries observed uniquely among children who started brushing late at 3 or 4 years, in our sample, warrant further investigation. Particularly, future studies could evaluate the possible Table 3 Unadjusted odds ratios (uOR), adjusted odds ratios (aOR), and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the key associated factors for dental caries in primary school children aged 6-8 years (Continued) role of cultural habit of using chewing stick (Miswak) for cleaning teeth on better outcome observed among children starting brushing at ages 5-6 compared to those starting brushing at 3 or 4 years in Saudi Arabia. Given the importance of brushing teeth regularly and mouthwash use in maintaining good oral hygiene and preventing dental caries [10] , and lower prevalence of these habits observed in our study, detailed investigation of various brushing practices (e.g., use of fluoridated/non fluoridated toothpaste, and use of chewing stick for cleaning teeth), and other oral hygiene practices (e.g., use of fluoride containing mouthwash) among primary school children in Saudi Arabia is necessary. Furthermore, interventions aimed at encouraging good oral health behaviors among children should be undertaken. The negative attitude or apprehension towards visiting a dentist was clearly evident in our study, where only 21.1% (95% CI 17.8-24.7%) of children visited a dentist for regular check-up, while the others visited for symptomatic treatment (e.g., toothache). The problem was even worse among younger children in Saudi Arabia; a mere 11% of children visited dentist for regular checkup on their first visit [20] . This dangerous trend might have prevented patients from availing sound advice on preventive oral health practices, thereby contributing to high prevalence, delayed recognition, and management of dental caries in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, Saudi children would benefit from publicly funded school-based dental screening programs that aid in timely detection and management of dental and other oral health problems. In addition, regular dental screening programs targeted at school children have an added benefit of realizing cost savings due to reduced need for advanced dental care [36] .",

Children in our study that were never breast-fed had higher risk of caries, which was consistent with existing literature [49] [50] [51] . Breast milk by itself was not cariogenic [52] , but the reported cariogenicity of certain infant formulas [53] and a higher risk associated with practice of breast feeding until late infancy (> 12 months -OR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.35-2.95) [54] should not discourage the practice of mixed feeding until the emergence of new evidence. Interestingly, children in our study that were exclusively breast-fed also experienced higher risk of caries, rendering support to the practice of mixed feeding. As noted in previously published literature [54] , it is possible that the practice of breast feeding until late infancy could have played a role in excess risk observed in Saudi children; however, further research based on a larger sample is warranted to confirm our findings and determine the role of duration of exclusive breast feeding on caries risk among children in Saudi Arabia.",

Information from various risk domains was systematically analyzed to aid in prioritizing the modifiable factors associated with dental caries experience in children. Unlike several prior studies in this area [10, 14, 16, 19, 34] , this study addressed the issue of multicollinearity and corrected potential bias from small sample in the analysis. The comprehensive nature of information collected encompassing various risk domains enabled us to evaluate the relative importance of individual factors over socioeconomic factors, a component seldom addressed in previous studies. Our study provides much needed baseline statistics on several population characteristics to aid not only local authorities, but also international organizations (e.g., WHO) to evaluate and improve the health programs aimed at mitigating the burden of dental caries in children.",

A self-administered questionnaire was used as the main study instrument, which is subjected to recall bias. However, we do not expect our results to be grossly affected by recall, owing to recurrent and current themes tested in the questionnaire. For example, we would expect a more accurate recollection of tooth brushing habits and child feeding practices that were routine activities performed in the recent past; collection of information on flavored milk, a recent trend in Saudi Arabia, serves as an example for current themes. The study sample was restricted to 6-8-year-old male primary school children in Riyadh city of Saudi Arabia, which warrants caution in generalizing the results to the entire country; however, given the cultural homogeneity and urbanity of the area, we would expect our estimates to be relevant to general population. Our study does not support generalizing the results to girl children, as our sample was restricted to boys to comply with school regulations and cultural sensitivities of Saudi population. Although some of our findings could be relevant to girls owing to shared cultural practices, future research should evaluate and confirm gender-related differences. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of this study warrants against drawing causal inferences.",

Several individual factors encompassing three risk domains, including oral health behaviors and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary habits, were found to be more relevant factors associated with dental caries than socioeconomic factors. Our results were consistent with findings in developed world where poor brushing habits, lack of dental coverage in health insurance, and high consumption of sodas were predominantly associated with dental caries. Future research should focus on confirming some of the unique or globally relevant associated factors for dental caries identified in our study, including late adoption of brushing, frequent consumption of sugary snacks between meals, and consumption of fresh fruits and flavored milk. Our results support the development and implementation of public awareness campaigns or health education programs targeted at primary school children to promote good oral health behaviors, feeding practices, and dietary habits.",
