In recent years, novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in a variety of fecal and environmental samples using deep sequencing approaches. In this study the identification of genomes of novel circoviruses and cycloviruses in feces of insectivorous bats is reported. Pan-reactive primers were used targeting the conserved rep region of circoviruses and cycloviruses to screen DNA bat fecal samples. Using this approach, partial rep sequences were detected which formed five phylogenetic groups distributed among the Circovirusand the recently proposed Cyclovirus genera of the Circoviridae. Further analysis using inverse PCR and Sanger sequencing led to the characterization of four new putative members of the family Circoviridae with genome size ranging from 1,608 to 1,790 nt, two inversely arranged ORFs, and canonical nonamer sequences atop a stem loop.",

            "text": "Viruses of the Circoviridae family are known to infect a wide range of vertebrates. The virions consist of naked nucleocapsids of about 20 nm in diameter, with a circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome of approximately 2.0 kb [1] . They have an ambisense genome organization containing two major open reading frames (ORFs) inversely arranged, responsible for encoding the replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, and are separated by a 3' intergenic region (IGR) between the stop codons and a 5' IGR between the start codons [2] . Some circoviruses are major pathogens of pigs [3] [4] [5] , e.g. porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) which causes either asymptomatic infections or clearly apparent disease which may be responsible for significant economic losses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In birds, avian circoviruses, within the genus Gyrovirus, have been identified in a broad range of avian species; one of them, chicken anemia virus (CAV), is a major cause of disease, associated to lymphoid depletion, immunosuppression and developmental abnormalities [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . According to the document 2014.006a-gV from ICTV, there is a proposal of the Gyrovirus genus removal from Circoviridae to Anelloviridae family due to recent metagenomic studies on gyroviruses showing a very high sequence divergence when compared to other circoviruses members.",

Some of the newly described circular genomes are similar to those of circoviruses, but phylogenetically different from the previously known avian and porcine circoviruses [18] . Their distinct nucleotide/ amino acid composition and genome organization allowed authors to propose the creation of a new genus within the Circoviridae, which was named Cyclovirus. In comparison to members of the genus Circovirus, both rep and cap cycloviruses genes are smaller, with shorter or no 3' IGR between the stop codons of the two major ORFs and a longer 5' IGR between the start codons of the two major ORFs [2] .",

The nucleotide sequences corresponding to part of the rep gene were determined and submitted to GenBank (KM401658-KM401681). BLASTX analysis showed that these partial rep sequences have an amino acid identity of 10-76% with those of known circoviruses and 87-100% among themselves. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences herein detected with those of the representative Circovirus and Cyclovirus sequences (Fig. 1) . As shown in the tree, it was observed the arrangement of five main groups with clusters II (4 sequences), VI (3 sequences) and VII (2 sequences) falling into the clade of cycloviruses, in contrast to clusters I (13 sequences) and V (2 sequences) that formed distinct and distant groups from those formed by circoviruses and cycloviruses. The arbitrary division of these sequences in clusters was carried out to analyze their genomic features, assuming that according to the criteria used for Circovirus diversity analysis, distinct species comprising more than >20% sequence divergence are considered to be classified as an individual viral [32] . According to this, we could infer the detection of five potential new species from bat samples (3 cycloviruses and 2 circoviruses). The impossibility to achieve the complete sequencing of virus DNA from clusters I and V was probably due to the high GC-rich content present in the 3\u00b4IGR GC region, even though attempts on PCR amplification before sequencing were made without much success by varying the concentrations of DMSO and/or in the presence of 50% 7-deaza-GTP and 50% dGTP (New England Biolabs), as performed by Rijsewijk et al.

They have a conserved nonanucleotide motif located at the 5' IGR (NANTATTAC) and are considered to be responsible for initiating the rolling-cycle replication of circoviruses [18, 34] . As shown in Table 3 , all four BatCV POA also contain a conserved nonamer sequence in the loop region of the 5' IGR, different from the conserved Cyclovirus and Circovirus nonanucleotide motif sequence, but similar to the loop motif of cycloviruses found on bat, human and chimpanzee feces (BatCV POA II, V, VI) and slightly modified from those of Cyclovirus and Circovirus (BatCV POA I) [2, 17, 18, 20] . The predicted protein sequences encoded by ORF2 (cap) and ORF1 (rep) of BatCV I-VI genomes were used for phylogenetic analysis with representative and recently discovered circoviruses/cycloviruses; Pepper golden mosaic virus was used as outgroup, as they are somewhat related to other members in the Circoviridae family (Fig. 3A, 3B and 3C ). As shown in the trees, BatCV POA/2012/II and VI fell into the cyclovirus clade already identified in chickens, chimps, bats, goats, humans and dragonflies [2, 17, 18, 20, 22] . When analyzing the cap-encoding region (Fig. 3A) , BatCV POA/2012/II was related to a Cyclovirus detected in muscle tissues of a goat from Pakistan through degenerate/consensus PCR [20] , and BatCV POA/2012/VI was more related to dragonfly Cyclovirus detected through viral metagenomics [22] . However, when analyzing both genomes according to the conserved rep-encoding region, it was observed that they formed a monophyletic clade (Fig. 3B) . On the other hand, BatCV POA/2012/I and V fell outside the Circovirus and Cyclovirus clades, not yet related to any genus of Circoviridae family along with Bat circovirus-like virus TM6 and batCV-SC703 [17, 18] . This situation was confirmed based on the alignments of the whole genomes, producing a similar tree topology (see Fig. 3C ). These sequences are closer to sequences detected in guano and fecal samples collected from bats in the United States and China through metagenomic approaches, suggesting that these viruses have the same host origin, likely from bats [17, 18] . However, currently, no classification has been fully considered to these sequences.",

            "text": "In this work we report the discovery of 4 novel circular ssDNA genomic sequences from insectivorous bats feces from Brazil. In the recent years, many genomes of circoviruses, cycloviruses and rep-containing circular DNA viruses have been characterized in mammals, birds, insects and environmental samples [19] bringing to light a high level of genetic diversity among these viruses [19, 35] . According to our results, two genomes belong to genus Cyclovirus (BatCV POA II and VI). These genomes are organized and contain two major ORFs in opposite directions, presenting in their 5' IGR of the rep ORF the cyclovirus-conserved nonanucleotide motif (5'-TAATACTAT-3') in their loop region (Table 3) . BatCV POA I and V present their cap located in the positive strand and the larger rep located on the minus strand, as expected for circoviruses, but this pattern was not present in BatCV POA II and VI, as shown in Table 1 . The phylogenetic analysis constructed based on the alignments of the complete REP and CAP protein confirms that BatCV POA/II and VI cluster into the genus Cyclovirus along with the Chinese cycloviruses sequences clade detected in bat feces [18] and sharing less than 65% of identity at the CAP/REP amino acid level. BatCV POA I and V had a low amino acid identity with CAP (<20%) and REP (<10%) sequences of two other sequences detected in bat feces in this study with known circoviruses/cycloviruses (Table 2) . Consequently, they formed a distinct clade along with other bat-sourced sequences, expanding the view of diversity in these new ssDNA viruses that are divergent enough at the sequence level that they could very likely be part of a different genus. In our study, we detected Cyclovirus and Circovirus related sequences at a frequency of 24% in the examined samples. However, due to methodological limitations, restriction in location and variety of bat species, we were not able to extrapolate our results to epidemiological data (such as incidence and prevalence) or to which bat species the ssDNA positive samples belonged. As performed by Ge et al. in China [36] , further investigation is needed to determine the prevalence of circoviruses in other Brazilian bat species. Nevertheless, it becomes clear that such study is worthy to understand the great diversity of circoviruses found worldwide.",

These new genomes have in common the presence in the Rep N-terminus of the same motifs associated with rolling circle replication (FTLNN, TPHLQGY) and dNTP-binding (GXGKS), as well as the conserved identified in the carboxy half of Rep amino acid motifs associated with 2C helicase function (WWDGY and DRYP) [19] . The N-terminal regions related to Cap proteins of BatCV POA I and V are highly basic and arginine-rich, as is typical for circoviruses capsid proteins with arginine residues ranging from 36%-42% (Genome I and V, respectively) along the first 50 aa, in contrast to TM6 (28%) and SC703 (26%). They are also distinguishable based on their CAP and REP sizes (data not shown), as well as on the low amino acid level for both proteins, as the percentage of amino acid identity of BatCV POA I and V shows a REP identity <45% and <35% for CAP identity in relation to TM6 and SC703. Based on these genomes characteristics, even though they are clustered in a separate clade, not yet characterized, they are new viral species. Upon the discovery of other sequences grouping along with these genomes, it will be of interest to propose the creation of a new genus within Circoviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).",
