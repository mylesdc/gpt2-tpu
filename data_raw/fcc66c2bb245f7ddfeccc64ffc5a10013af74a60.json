To evaluate the efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37\u02daC. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited conditions.",

Wolbachia is a maternally-transmitted endosymbiont that can rapidly become established in the natural mosquito populations and can inhibit a variety of pathogens, including arboviruses, malaria parasites, and filarial nematodes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Wolbachia control strategies are currently being deployed into the field to alter the capacity of Aedes aegypti to transmit arboviruses or to suppress mosquito populations [16] [17] [18] . Surveillance of transinfected mosquitoes as well as natural vector populations is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions [19] . However, most current screening methods rely on PCR, which is expensive and relies on laboratory facilities. In addition to screening for Wolbachia infection, it would also be desirable to identify the host mosquito species using these assays since different mosquito species differ in their ability to transmit pathogens [20] . Knowledge of vector species, and prevalence and stability of Wolbachia is essential for effective vector control and pre-emption of disease outbreaks with public health measures [21] .",

However, although LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity it often produces spurious amplicons, which in turn lead to false positive readouts with non-specific reporters such as Mg 2+ precipitation or fluorescent dye intercalation [32] [33] [34] .",

The single stranded 'toehold' regions of OSD probes bind to LAMP amplicon loop sequences, and then signal via strand exchange [40] that leads to separation of a fluorophore and quencher [39] . OSDs are the functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and can specifically report single or multiplex LAMP amplicons without interference from non-specific nucleic acids or inhibitors [39, 41] . OSDs significantly enhance the diagnostic applicability of LAMP, allowing it to match the allelic specificity of real-time PCR. Recently, we engineered these molecular innovations to function fluently in one-pot LAMP-OSD reactions that can directly amplify a few tens to hundreds of copies of DNA and RNA analytes from minimally processed specimens and produce sequence-specific fluorescence signals that are easily observable by the human eye or (more importantly) by unmodified cellphone cameras [42] . The fluorescence endpoints that are produced can be used for yes/no determinations of the presence of an analyte, and also estimation of analyte copies on an order of magnitude scale [42, 43] .",

The wsp LAMP assay could readily identify Wolbachia infection in 3 out of 4 Ae. albopictus mosquitoes stored at -20\u02daC for as long as 3 weeks. PCR analysis of the wsp-negative mosquito using previously described primers (81F and 691R) and protocols [28] did not produce amplicons suggesting that this individual was likely uninfected or had Wolbachia levels below the levels detectable by PCR. As the storage temperature was increased the frequency of Wolbachia detection dropped. While 40% of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes stored at 4\u02daC gave a positive wsp LAMP-OSD signal, none of the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes kept at 37\u02daC for even as little as 1 week were wsp positive. All mosquitoes that failed to generate a signal by LAMP also failed to produce wsp PCR amplicons.

These results suggest that our rapid sample preparation method and smartphone-read LAMP-OSD assays can be used for accurate analysis of both individual and pooled mosquitoes.",

Unfortunately, currently available tools for mosquito diagnostics have several shortcomings. Morphological identification methods are inherently low throughput, require extensive technical expertise, and cannot also readily identify pathogens or biocontrol agents such as Wolbachia. Spectroscopy, such as near infrared spectroscopy [61] and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [62] , allow identification of mosquito species, Wolbachia, and pathogens, but require expensive instruments and expertise that are generally incompatible with low-resource settings. Immunoassays can detect pathogen-carrying vectors but are insensitive and cannot also identify vector species. Nucleic acid amplification methods could potentially look at both vector and symbiont sequences, but are heavily reliant on PCR with the ensuing encumbrances of expensive instruments and trained operators, again precluding widespread use.",

To overcome these barriers to the use of LAMP, we have previously adopted methods that originated in the field of nucleic acid computation: the use of strand exchange reactions that initiate at complementary single-stranded 'toeholds' and progresses via branch migration. The base-pairing predictability and programmability of strand exchange kinetics promotes the construction of exquisitely sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes for LAMP amplicons (S1 Fig), thereby greatly reducing the detection of non-specific amplification background [39, 41, 42] . For instance, we recorded positive coi LAMP-OSD signals from field-caught Ae. aegypti mosquitos but did not detect signal from closely related Ae. albopictus and Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes. Similarly, the wsp assay detected wAlbB and wPip, as expected, but not wMel, wMors, wAna, wAus, or wAlbA Wolbachia.",

For example, strand exchange transducers can logically integrate multiple analytes; transform nucleic acids to glucose and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG); adapt readout to beads, paperfluidics, glucose meters, pregnancy test strips, and cellphones, and allow target copy number estimation using a single endpoint yes/no readout of presence or absence of signal above an adjustable threshold [68] [69] [70] [71] . In the current instance, we deliberately designed our wsp LAMP-OSD assay to 'compute' the presence of both wAlbB and wPip in order to increase our odds of finding infected field-caught mosquitoes. However, the dependence of strand exchange efficiency on toehold binding strength [39] can be exploited to engineer yes/no distinctions between strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms [39] , and the same dual wsp assay could be rendered strain-specific by simply substituting an OSD reporter specific to an alternate polymorphic loop sequence ( S2  Fig). This might be advantageous for strain discrimination if double infections were released during vector control measures [72, 73] .",

First, without prior knowledge of integration sites, nucleic acid amplification tests will be unable to differentiate wsp target sequences derived from infectious Wolbachia bacterial genomes versus Wolbachia DNA integrated in nuclear genomes of hosts such as Drosophila ananassae [77] . However, other PCR-based assays also face this challenge. Second, nucleic acid amplification may not be significantly diminished by the presence of one or two mismatches between a primer and its target binding site [41, 78] . While, ability to generate a positive signal from very closely related target variants that differ by only one or two nucleotides is desirable, it is important for a nucleic acid test to distinguish polymorphic strains. Unlike two-primer systems such as qPCR, use of at least six primer binding sites during LAMP allows LAMP primers to scan a three times larger target sequence space for distinguishable polymorphisms. As a result, LAMP assays are more likely to distinguish unexpected polymorphic strains due to the likelihood of encountering mismatches in multiple primers that would in turn lead to diminution of amplification and false positive signals.",

For example, LAMP-based assays have been developed to identify pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes and insecticide resistance alleles [79] [80] [81] [82] , but these rely on purified nucleic acid as templates and non-specific readout whereas our method functions with mosquito homogenate and ensures accuracy using unique sequence-specific strand exchange probes. In addition, this technology could be used to identify gut microbes and insect-specific viruses associated with mosquitoes, which is of growing interest given that it is becoming clear that the microbiome can shape vector competence for human pathogens [83] [84] [85] . Overall, we have demonstrated a versatile nucleic acid diagnostic platform for rapid and accurate analyses of both insect vectors and symbionts, and that can now be further configured for additional applications.",

LAMP uses 2 inner (FIP and BIP) and 2 outer (F3 and B3) primers specific to 6 blocks of target sequences designated as B3, B2, B1, F1c, F2c and F3c. F2 sequence in FIP (F1c-F2) initiates amplification by Bst DNA polymerase (Stage I). F1c sequence in FIP self-primes subsequent amplification. Similarly, BIP (B1c-B2) initiates DNA synthesis by binding to B2c. F3 and B3 primer-initiated DNA synthesis displaces preceding inner primer-initiated strands, which serve as templates for primer-initiated strand displacement DNA synthesis (Stage II). 3 0 -ends of the resulting single-stranded, dumbbell-shaped amplicons (Stage III) are extended by Bst polymerase to form hairpins (Stage IV). Inner primers hybridize to the single-stranded loops and initiate another round of strand displacement synthesis that opens the original hairpin to form a concatemerized amplicon containing a selfpriming 3 0 -end hairpin (Stage V). The ensuing continuous amplification (initiated both by new inner primers and by self-priming) generates increasingly complex, double-stranded concatameric amplicons containing self-priming hairpins and single-stranded loops to which the OSD probe hybridizes. \"c\": denotes complementary target sequences. F and Q on the OSD denote fluorophore and quencher, respectively. OSD probe is denoted in terms of numbered domains, each of which represents a short fragment (usually <12 nt) of DNA sequence in an otherwise continuous oligonucleotide strand. Single stranded toeholds are numbered in red. Complementarity between numbered OSD domains is denoted by a single prime symbol. (PDF) S2 Fig. Comparison of wsp sequences from different Wolbachia strains. Alignment using wAlbB as the reference strain (A). \"Current wsp OSD\" refers to the wsp OSD probe used in the present study that binds to the loop sequence between the F1 and F2 target regions. It would not distinguish the closely related wAlbB and wPip strains. The \"wAlbB vs wPip OSD\", which would bind to the loop region between the B1 and B2 regions of our current wsp LAMP assay would allow discrimination of wAlbB and wPip strains due to specificity of interaction with the three highlighted polymorphic positions. The wsp sequences of the remaining Wolbachia strains are significantly different from wAlbB wsp sequence and are not detected by the wAlbB/wPip-specific wsp LAMP-OSD assay (B). Pooled synthetic DNA representing wAlbA, wAus, wMors, and wAna as well as standalone wAlbB wsp target sequences were analyzed by wAlbB/wPip-specific wsp LAMP-OSD assays. Smartphone image was acquired at endpoint following 90 min of amplification. (PDF) ",
