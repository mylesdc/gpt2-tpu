We propose a method to estimate incidence reporting rates at early stages of new influenza pandemics using 2009 pandemic H1N1 as an example. Routine surveillance data and statistics of travellers arriving from Mexico were used. Our method incorporates changes in reporting rates such as linearly increasing trends due to the enhanced surveillance. From our results, the reporting rate was estimated at 0\u00b746% during early stages of the pandemic in Mexico. We estimated cumulative incidence in the Mexican population to be 0\u00b77% compared to 0\u00b7003% reported by officials in Mexico at the end of April. This method could be useful in estimation of actual cases during new influenza pandemics for policy makers to better determine appropriate control measures.",

Underreporting of influenza cases in early stages poses problems in estimating both pandemic severity and transmission intensity. Underreporting stems from the short infectious periods of influenza infections; thus, individuals may recover before seeking treatment from their healthcare provider or before being tracked in a surveillance system. Asymptomatic or mild cases may not even be reported at all. A previous study has shown that official surveillance only reveals a small proportion of actual infections during influenza pandemics [1] in some instances the consultation rate in influenza-like illness case-patients was no more than 50%. Furthermore, cases increase exponentially during the initial stage of an outbreak and the limited capacity of surveillance systems, such as limited serological tests, can also lead to underreporting [2] .",

Although it was not a peak season for an influenza outbreak, routine influenza surveillance identified an unexpected increase in cases of an influenza-like illness in mid-April 2009 [4] . An acute respiratory illness was discovered in two children and further confirmed as a new strain of H1N1 virus. Subsequently, on 26 April 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) notified the public of the new H1N1. Additional cases were soon discovered in the USA [5] , and the WHO had raised the H1N1 pandemic alert level to phase 5 by the end of April. At the time, governments and the public still lacked sufficient knowledge about the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, according to H1N1 surveillance data from the Ministry of Health in Mexico, cumulative incidence was measured to be as low as 0\u00b7003% in Mexico's population [6] .",

Because surveillance at the borders was quite thorough for influenza-like illness cases even before the H1N1 virus had spread globally, data on early cases such as time of import from the source country is relatively more complete and timely than other available data.

According to our results, the estimated epidemic size was larger than officially reported in 2009; we found an estimate of 0\u00b77% cumulative incidence (about 691 000 individuals) in the Mexican population compared to the 0\u00b7003% reported from the Ministry of Health of Mexico [6] . In terms of the epidemic size, our estimates were in line with other studies [2, 31] but were higher than that of Fraser et al. [28] . The reason for the difference is that our approach adopted time-series data for reported incidence, which can help better validate results when using traveller data. Several studies have employed a cross-sectional set of travel data to estimate actual epidemic size but those approaches did not aim to project the epidemic curve or address trends of reporting behaviour.",

With the use of the SEIR model and the estimates, we were also able to estimate that around 0\u00b7005% of the Mexican population was infected prior to the first case being detected by the surveillance system. Therefore, there is a possibility that undetected cases from Mexico, in other countries before the first global case was reported, could have affected our estimates. By using the mathematical model, the probability of having imported case from Mexico for at least one listed country (Table 1) was about 0\u00b721 (results not showed) prior to 14 March 2009 . Hence, the early 'missing' detection of imported cases from Mexico was not unexpected. This situation has similar potential issues with entry-screening sensitivities mentioned previously in the Results section, and we believe it would have only a minor effect on our findings.",

If surveillance data from travellers could be collected in a timely way, it could effectively align with the estimation of a new influenza pandemic size and threat. However, there are challenges in acquiring large samples because countries especially those which do not border each other have different and incompatible surveillance systems as well as disparate policies on international reporting and collaboration. In our study, we only found 12 countries that reported their confirmed cases with known travel history in Mexico. Regarding this issue of small sample size, a bootstrap method was the preferred choice. In the future, improved coordination and technical innovations to streamline or even centralize infectious disease surveillance of travellers between countries would be beneficial to public health.",

However, compared to the surveillance data at borders, routine samples of seroprevalence may not be suitable during an initial outbreak of a pandemic as it requires laboratory resources and a longer collection time [32] . Its reliability also relies on the sampling frame of the data [33] . Using serial crosssectional serological data along with surveillance data could be reliable in estimating infection rates, since serological data could refine parameter estimates [33] . In order to account for possible estimation errors, multi-faceted surveillance measures are recommended, especially for new outbreaks of influenza pandemics during the early stages.",

It can be extended using similar concepts which adapt the reporting rate function of incidence in the epidemic models. For example, our approach could potentially be extended to demographic stratified models. As younger age groups were likely to be affected by pH1N1 and to be presented in ascertainment, incorporation of demographic stratified models would make the modelling results more realistic. However, sufficient data is required to support the extension of the method.",

Clearly, the pH1N1 outbreak may have not yet spread to all cities in Mexico at the early stage. Without available infection data at the city level, the resolution of our results would not be high enough and the spatial variation would alter our estimates. Although our method provides further understanding on how to tackle estimates of incidence reporting rates at early stages of an influenza outbreak, future studies could explore further model extensions.",
