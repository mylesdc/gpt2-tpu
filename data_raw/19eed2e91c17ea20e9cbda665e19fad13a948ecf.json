            "text": "Cellular receptor-mediated signaling pathways play critical roles during the initial immune response to Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. However, the involvement of type-I transmembrane glycoprotein CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) in the antiviral response to HCMV infection is still unknown. Here, we demonstrated the specific knockdown of CD147 significantly decreased HCMV-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), which contribute to the cellular antiviral responses. Next, we confirmed that HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p could target the 3 UTR (Untranslated Region) of CD147 mRNA, and thus facilitate HCMV lytic propagation at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). The expression and secretion of Cyclophilin A (sCyPA), as a ligand for CD147 and a proinflammatory cytokine, were up-regulated in response to HCMV stimuli. Finally, we confirmed that CD147 mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral signaling via the sCyPA-CD147-ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases)/NF-\u03baB axis signaling pathway. These findings reveal an important HCMV mechanism for evading antiviral innate immunity through its encoded microRNA by targeting transmembrane glycoprotein CD147, and a potential cause of HCMV inflammatory disorders due to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine CyPA.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread human \u03b2-herpesvirus with seroprevalence from 40 to 100%, which is closely related to socioeconomic and geographical conditions [1] . Life-long latent or persistent HCMV infection can be established in immunocompetent populations after the primary infection, and productive replication can occur from spontaneous reactivation due to immune abnormalities. Thus, HCMV is a major viral cause of mental retardation and sensorineural deafness in newborns, and particularly causes morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients and AIDS patients with an immunocompromised state [2] . Current studies also tie HCMV to multiple common chronic Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was provided by Fenyong Liu (University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA). To generate the U251-CD147 overexpressing (U251-CD147) and U251-Control (U251-C) cell lines, U251 MG cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-CD147 plasmid or the pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) empty vector control plasmid using Lipofectamine TM 2000, as prescribed by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). After a 48-h incubation, transfected cells were selected for resistance in cell culture medium containing 600 \u00b5g/mL G418 (Life Technologies). After two to three weeks of selection, single clones were randomly isolated, and each was plated separately. The CD147 levels in individual selected clones were determined by Western blot analysis. The maintenance medium for cell lines was supplemented with 200 \u00b5g/mL G418. The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived clinical strain NR-1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression cassette, provided by Dr. Ke Zen (Nanjing University, Nanjing, China), was used in this study [21] . HCMV mutant (mUS25-1-5p) and the revertant wild type (RvWT) was generated using a bacterial recombineering method, as previously described [22] . In brief, approximately 300 bp of the miR-US25-1 flanking region was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The three nucleotides in the seed region of miR-US25-1-5p were mutated using site-directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then, the PCR-amplified products containing point mutations of miR-US25-1-5p were used in the second round of recombination to replace the Tet/Str cassette that inserted in the region of miR-US25-1-5p at first. The amplified DNA fragments were transformed into E. coli EL350 cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The bacteria harboring the rescued BACs were selected in the presence of streptomycin. Mutants were confirmed using BAC DNA sequencing. Similarly, the BAC of RvWT was generated based on the newly constructed mUS25-1-5p, with two rounds of recombination. HCMV WT, mUS25-1-5p, and RvWT were propagated in HFF cells, and virus stocks were stored in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at \u221280 \u2022 C.",

Here, we have investigated the role of CD147/EMMPRIN in this response. We established two stable knockdowns of CD147, with a CD147-specific short hairpin RNAs (siCD147) targeting the 3 UTR of cellular CD147 mRNA, and two corresponding non-specific RNAi stable cells as controls (siControl) via lentiviral-based transduction of Human astrocytoma U251 cells (U251 cells) and Human foreskin fibroblasts cells (HFF cells). CD147 expression was markedly reduced in siCD147-transduced cells when compared to the level in siControl cells, as observed with immunoblotting ( Figure S1 ). Then, we measured the effect of CD147 knockdown on HCMV-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB promoters using a dual-luciferase reporter assay in U251 cells. CD147 knockdown significantly reduced the activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b2 promoters that were stimulated by infection with HCMV, but not with Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Figure 1a ). In addition, the ectopic expression of CD147-WT, but not the extracellular domain (residues 1-185) or intracellular domain (residues 230-269) deletion mutants of CD147 (CD147-dECD and CD147-dICD), restored promoter activity that was impaired by CD147-specific RNAi. These results confirm the specific contribution of CD147 to the induction of NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b2 by HCMV infection (Figure 1b) . We next examined whether the endogenous CD147 was required for HCMV-induced antiviral signaling under physiological conditions. We found that the knockdown of CD147 expression in HFF cells decreased the activation of IFNB1 and interferon-stimulated ISG15 gene expression induced by HCMV infection, as well as expression of the NF-\u03baB downstream genes IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 1c ). Together, these data suggest that CD147 might block the HCMV-triggered early antiviral immune responses in a virus-specific manner.

The protein expression levels of CD147 were dramatically down-regulated after 24 hpi of HCMV infection (Figure 3a ), corresponding to a decrease in the relative RNA expression (Figure 3b ). It is well known that microRNAs encoded by HCMV play essential roles in all aspects of the HCMV life cycle through the manipulation of many cellular signaling pathways. Thus, we next investigated whether the expression of CD147 was targeted and down-regulated by one of the HCMV-encoded 24 mature miRNAs previously identified in the reactome database (www.reactome.org). Using RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ rnahybrid/submission), we screened 14 HCMV-encoded mature miRNA candidates that might target the 3 UTR region of CD147. To experimentally determine which HCMV-encoded miRNAs targets CD147, a pmirGLO dual luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3 UTR sequence of human CD147 downstream of the firefly luciferase gene was generated. Transfection of Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (293 cells) with each of the individual 14 putative HCMV miRNA constructs, and subsequent luciferase assay, suggested that CD147 was most likely targeted by miR-US25-1-5p (Figure 3c ).

When compared to cells that were transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA (NC) or miR-UL25-1-3p mimic, the CD147 protein level was appreciably reduced after the transfection of the miR-UL25-1-5p mimic. Notably, the efficiency was almost comparable to the commercial siRNA against CD147 (miR-CD147) (Figure 3f ). These results indicate that miR-UL25-1-5p efficiently targets and down-regulates endogenous CD147 via a specific location site in the 3 UTR sequence.

However, none of the suggested glycoproteins has been validated as a bona fide receptor that is necessary for HCMV infection of all the susceptible cell types. The in vivo broad tissue tropism of HCMV infection and differences in permissiveness for different cell types suggest that HCMV likely uses distinct cell surface receptors depending on the target cells. Thus, identifying the specific HCMV cellular receptors is important for understanding the pathogenesis of HCMV. CD147/EMMPRIN is a transmembrane receptor glycoprotein that is belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and expressed at varying levels in many tissue cells. Notably, several bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Plasmodium falciparum, as well as many viruses, including HIV-1, HBV, SARS-CoV, and measles virus (Mev), have been previously found to infect target cells via CD147, indicating that it might constitute an evolutionarily conserved pathogen receptor for infection and spread within tissues and organisms [31] . Unfortunately, neither the infection-blocking experiment using CD147-specfic antibody, nor the viral infection test with CD147-knockdown cells, showed any difference in facilitating HCMV entry ( Figure S2 ). Since a low passage clinical HCMV strain NR-1 was used in these experiments, we assumed that CD147 does not function as a broad-spectrum receptor for HCMV infection, at least in typical in vitro permissive cell lines.",

            "text": "In addition to the pathogen recognition receptor function, most transmembrane receptor proteins have been proposed to mediate signal transduction pathways immediately upon pathogenic particle attachment and penetration. CD147 belongs to the Type I membrane proteins and as a candidate tumor biomarker, its expression is up-regulated in breast cancer tissue, lung carcinoma tissue, and bladder cancer tissue, along with a tumor's malignance, invasiveness, and metastasis [32] . CD147 has been extensively studied since the discovery of its function in tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we have explored a previously unknown role for CD147 in the host innate immune defense against HCMV invasion. Cells detect HCMV infection as early as four to eight hours post-infection (hpi), responding by producing NF-\u03baB-dependent cytokines and an early peak of antiviral IFN [5, 33] . Our experiments indicate that endogenous CD147 is required for the maximum activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b2-associated antiviral signaling that is triggered by HCMV infection, possibly having a redundant effect with other cell surface receptor glycoproteins (Figure 1 ). Many tumor-related proteins, such as Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PTEN, are known to play key roles in regulating the innate immunity against viral and bacterial infection [34, 35] . However, the involvement of CD147 in early antiviral immunity appears to be specific to HCMV infection, since it does not extend to other viruses, like HSV-1. Since the signaling pathways of CD147 remain to be well defined, we next demonstrated that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and then nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB might play a leading role in CD147-mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral signal transduction, with a subsequent activation of the IRF3 phosphorylation and the orchestrated NF-\u03baB-dependent cytokines, IRF3 plus NF-\u03baB-dependent interferon responses ( Figure 6 ). This finding can be supported by the fact that NF-\u03baB is a key transcriptional enhancesome-component of the IFN-\u03b2, according to previous research [36, 37] .",

For example, cmvIL-10, a viral mimic of human IL-10 acquired from the cellular genome, binds with a high affinity to the human IL-10 receptor, and limits the innate and adaptive immune responses even more efficiently than IL-10 itself [38] . In this study, we have demonstrated that HCMV infection leads to the expression and secretion of a cellular chemokine, CyPA. Studies show that CypA, as an extracellular ligand for its receptor CD147, can be secreted by various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts, and triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses [39] . We demonstrated that CD147-mediated HCMV-triggered phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and the activation of NF-\u03baB depends on the release of CyPA from HCMV infected cells and its interaction with CD147 ( Figure 2 ). Although HCMV is highly species-specific with no animal model yet known to support its replication, we speculate that secreted extracellular CypA, triggered by HCMV infection, acts through a paracrine mechanism, to stimulate uninfected cells to defend against a second wave of infection by the progeny virus through the interaction with CD147.",

However, we found no difference in the expression of ISGs after infection with the mutant virus. Based on previous studies and our overall findings, the reasons might be complex. At the late stage of infection, HCMV often uses multi-faceted and redundant strategies to regulate immune responses. Thus, the effect of natural miR-US25-1-5p may not be able to be detectable at late times of HCMV infection. We speculate that secreted extracellular CypA, which is triggered by HCMV infection, acts primarily to defend uninfected cells against progeny HCMV virus released from neighboring infected cells. As a result, the observed lack of differences in virus yield at the higher MOI, irrespective of the mutation of miR-US25-1-5p in the targeting of CD147 mRNA 3 UTR or ectopic expression of CD147, are understandable (Figure 5c ).",

As a paracrine proinflammatory cytokine, CyPA interacts with CD147 of those uninfected cells and tissues, and stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The activation of NF-\u03baB then occurs, followed by a subsequent activation of the IRF3 phosphorylation and the orchestrated NF-\u03baB-dependent, IRF3 plus NF-\u03baB-dependent immune responses. HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p targeting CD147, CD147-blocking mAb, and an inhibitor of CyPA (CsA) can specifically inhibit this process.",
