Importantly, specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) subtypes control the amplitude and duration of cAMP-induced physiological processes and are therefore a prominent pharmacological target currently used in a variety of fields. Here we tested the extracts from traditional Chinese medicine, Forsythia suspense seeds, which have been used for more than 2000 years to relieve respiratory symptoms. Using structural-functional analysis we found its major lignin, Forsynthin, acted as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting PDE4 in inflammatory and immune cell. Moreover, several novel, selective small molecule derivatives of Forsythin were tested in vitro and in murine models of viral and bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and cytokine-driven systemic inflammation. Thus, pharmacological targeting of PDE4 may be a promising strategy for immune-related disorders characterized by amplified host inflammatory response.",

Consequently, by severing these cA/GMP-dependent pathways, PDE has an enormous clinical significance monitoring cAMP and cGMP levels in cells. The PDE superfamily comprises 11 subfamilies, PDE1-11, respectively, each utilizing different substrate specificities. For example, PDE4, 7, and 8 strictly hydrolyze cAMP; PDE5, 6, and 9, on the other hand, only hydrolyze cGMP while the other family members (PDE1, 2, 3, 10, 11) can target both cAMP and cGMP for hydrolysation [4] . For many years, PDE enzymes have remained an interest within the pharmaceutical industry, as inhibition of PDE can increase the levels of cAMP or cGMP thus enhancing or prolonging their natural physiological effects [5] .",

For example, caffeine, aminophylline, and IBMX are nonselective PDE inhibitors [6] that increase intracellular cAMP, thereby activating PKA, thus inhibiting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory cytokines, and reducing inflammation [7] . There are also selective PDE inhibitors. Specifically, PDE3 inhibitors such as inamrinone and milrinone, are used for short-term treatment of congestive heart failure [8] , and Cilostazol used in the treatment of intermittent claudication [9] . The PDE5 inhibitors Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil boost cGMP levels in penile tissue [10] [11] [12] and are used primarily for erectile dysfunction, as well as having secondary indication in treatment of pulmonary hypertension [13, 14] . Recently , an opium alkaloid, Papaverine, was shown to inhibit PDE10 [15] . Among all of the PDE isoforms, PDE4 is the major cAMP-degrading enzyme found in inflammatory and immune cells. Selectively inhibiting PDE4 prevents the release of cytokines and other inflammatory factors and hinders the production of reactive oxygen species [16, 17] .",

Cytokine storm occurs in response to infection with virulent pathogens, host cell injury, or irritants that activate a multitude of receptors on immune effector cells. Under some conditions it is exaggerated (hypercytokinemia) and results in a fatal immune reaction with constant activation of immune effector cells that produce sustained or supraphysiologic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL1), and interleukin-6 (IL6) that results in severe tissue injury and often death.

Since then, it has been habitually and widely used in Asia as one of the major traditional medicines. Nowadays, the extract of Forsythia suspensa seeds is used to treat numerous inflammatory diseases including but not limited to erysipelas, inflammation, pharyngitis, pyrexia, tonsillitis, and ulcers [20, 21] . Moreover, it has been shown in studies that the crude extract displays potential antibacterial, antiviral, choleretic and antipyretic effects [22] . Medicinal chemistry studies on Forsythia seeds have revealed phenolic compounds including lignans and flavonols which are suspected to be responsible for the various biological activities of the herb [22, 23] . In this study, we sought to better understand Forsythia lignan Forsythin structure-function relationships and it was used to design and test a new class of selective PDE4 inhibitors. These selective PDE4 inhibitors exert potent antiinflammatory activity in several murine models of inflammation.",

Specifically, cAMP actives PKA, negatively regulates NF-KB pathway, thus suppressing the release of proinflammatory mediators (eg, TNF-a, interleukin-17, Interferon-c) [28] .

            "text": "Here we developed a novel class of selective PDE4 inhibitors that exert robust anti-inflammatory activity by impairing cytokine release in three preclinical models. The structural basis for our drug design emerged from Forsythin, the one of major compound extracted from Forsythia suspensa seeds. Among the 14 compounds tested in this study, synthetic compounds 6, 9 and 13 showed the potent IC 50 (10-90 nM) toward PDE4. Impressively, these compounds also exhibit high selectivity toward PDE4, with .80 mM IC 50 towards other PDE (Fig. 3 ). Compounds 6, 9 and 13 also showed potent IC 50 (20-450 nM) toward TNF inhibition in LPS stimulated RAW274.7 and PBMC cells. Many natural compounds, such as the flavonoid derivatives Hesperetin and prunetin, were also isolated from traditional Chinese medicines are selective inhibitors of PDE4 with an IC 50 ranging from 10-100 mM [30] . However, little is known about the structure-activity relationship between such lignans or their inhibitory effect on proteins in the inflammatory pathway. In this study, we determined that olinked b-D-glucopyranosided lignan Forsythin is a weak but selective inhibitor of PDE4. Structurally speaking, compound 6 and Forsythin are highly similar except that Forsythin is an o-linked b-D-glucopyranoside. In vitro, Forsythin is .80 times weaker in activity toward PDE4 compared with compound 6. However, our in vivo study suggested that Forsythin and compound 6 exhibit similar activities in several murine models (Fig. 5A, 6C, 7B ). This suggests that Forsythin may act as a prodrug that its glucopyranoside group will be potentially removed in vivo by b-glucosidase, and release the active lignin; which is a common of metabolic reaction in plant lignans and flavonols [31, 32] .",

            "text": "Pandemic H5N1 Influenza virus and SARS virus are known to cause dangerous cytokine storm resulting in severe damage to alveoli and lung tissue and thus Fig. 6 . PDE4 inhibitors lessen cytokine storm induced by LPS septic shock. C57/BL6 mice were administered i.p. nothing (CON), vehicle, 10 ug/kg, 100 ug/kg, 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of compounds 6, 7 or 9. Mice were given LPS (E. coli, 100 mg) 10 min later through an i.p. injection. 2 h later mice were euthanized using pentobarbital and blood was collected for IL-6 and TNF measurements. Shown in panel A-B is the % inhibition of cytokine levels as a function of drug dose. The data represent n53 mice/group at each dose. C57/BL6 mice were also pretreated with compound 5, 6, 7 or 9 at 1 mg/kg. Mice were given LPS (E. coli, 100 mg) 18 h later through an i.p. injection. 2 h later the mice were euthanized using pentobarbital and blood was collected for IL-6 and TNF measurements (C-D). The data represent n54-6 mice/group, *P,0.05 versus vehicle. extremely high mortality rates [33, 34] . Today, viral pneumonia affects more than 100 million children and 100 million adults per year yet there are no effective treatments only supportive care [35] . Our H1N1 murine model recapitulates well with the deadly human viral pneumonia, as H5N1 Influenza infection is largely driven by an exuberant host response and amplification of cytokines and chemokines that contribute to influenza-induced morbidity and mortality [25, 36, 37] . Our pulmonary viral infection model was complemented with a murine sepsis model to provide assessment of PDE4 inhibitors on systemic inflammation by the endotoxin LPS [37, 38] . Importantly, in each of these models of inflammation, our PDE4 inhibitors (Compound 6, 7, 9, 13) were observed to lessen severity of tissue injury using varying modes of application (parenteral, oral), and none of the animals treated with the agents exhibited overt signs of distress. The dosing of these compounds also appeared to be excellent in vivo, with ,1 mg/kg efficacious dose in both LPS pneumonia and sepsis model. Specifically, these compounds also appeared to have long half-life in vivo. As shown in Fig. 6C -D, the septic shock model was carried out 18 h after the initial treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.), yet we still observed a 40-60% decrease in serum cytokines. Overall, our pre-clinical studies demonstrate the biological efficacy of selective PDE4 inhibitors in murine models where both infectious and irritant factors trigger cytokine release. These selective PDE4 inhibitors could potentially have broad applications in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. In fact the selective PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast, recently became the first FDA approved PDE4 inhibitor on the market [39, 40] . Roflumilast is a potent anti-inflammatory drug, particularly in pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, and rhinitis. Thus, PDE4 is a potentially important drug target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. However, further research and development clearly is needed to carefully ascertain the safety profile, distribution, elimination, and metabolism of these new chemical entities in larger models of inflammation. Successful results from these pharmacokinetic studies will set the stage for transition to clinical testing in subjects with acute and chronic immune-related illness.",
