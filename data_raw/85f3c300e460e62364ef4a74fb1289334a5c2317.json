This disease is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and has respiratory signs. In hens infected with IBV, decreased egg production and quality are often observed. Some IBV strains are nephropathogenic, and infection with these strains can result in interstitial nephritis and mortality [1] . IBV encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. The S protein of IBV is initially translated into a precursor glycoprotein that is cleaved posttranslationally to form two subunits, S1 and S2 [2] . Most of the virus-neutralizing antibodies target the S1 protein [3] . Currently, both modified live and inactivated vaccines are commercially available [1] . Despite the intensive vaccination efforts, outbreaks of IBV frequently occur due to the persistence of different IBV serotypes. These serotypes arise from point mutations, insertions, deletions, and RNA recombination [3] . Multiple distinct genetic groups of IBV have been reported, but since 1996, the predominant field isolates in China have been classified as QX-like (LX4-type) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . QX-like IBVs are circulating in almost all of the countries in Europe, and these variants are frequently associated with cases of nephritis and false layer syndrome in chickens [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Clearly, QX-like IBVs are a serious threat to the poultry industry. However, no vaccines against QX-like IBVs are commercially available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines that can prevent QX-like IBV infection.",

However, the protective efficacy that is conferred by recombinant fowlpox viruses could be diminished in commercial chickens due to the presence of maternal antibodies against fowlpox virus [33, 34] . In fact, fowlpox vaccines are widely used in commercial chickens, which hinder the application of recombinant vaccines that are based on fowlpox virus vectors. Compared with other viral vectors, the CVI988/Rispens has several unique advantages. The CVI988/Rispens is the most effective MD vaccine obtained thus far [35] . Additionally, the CVI988/Rispens can persistently infect chickens, which results in the continuous expression of inserted, heterologous antigens [17] .

[36] . The S1 gene from the IBV strain CK/CH/JS/06II was amplified from genomic RNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Phusion \u00ae High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) using primers S1-F (5\u2032-AAAGCGGCCGCGAGATGTTGGG GAAGTCACTG-3\u2032) and S1-R (5\u2032-ATTCCTAGGTTAG CCATAACTAACATAAGGGCAACT-3\u2032). These primers were designed based on the S1 gene sequence of CK/CH/ JS/06II. Artificial Avr II and Not I restriction sites (underlined) permitted the direct cloning of a 1641-bp fragment of the resulting amplicon into the pUP/DOWN vector. This resulted in the plasmid pUP-S1-DOWN. To produce the transfer vector pUP-LTR-EGFP-S1-DOWN containing an EGFP reporter gene, the plasmid pLTR-GFP was digested with Not I (New England BioLabs), and the LTR-EGFP expression cassette was cloned into the Not Idigested, pUP-S1-DOWN plasmid in the same orientation as the S1 gene (Figure 7a ). The insertion of both the S1 gene and LTR-EGFP was verified by Avr II and Not I (New England BioLabs) digestion. The correct orientation of the insertion was confirmed by Hind III (New England BioLabs) digestion, as illustrated in Figure 7b . The transfer vector was further confirmed by gene sequencing (GenScript, Nanjing, China).",
