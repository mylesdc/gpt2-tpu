Hydrodynamic injection (HI) of HBV in the mouse model is a useful tool for study of HBV replication in vivo. However, only HBV genotype A has been used for studies with HI. Methods: We constructed 3 replication-competent clones containing 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold overlength of a HBV genotype B genome and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, A HBV genotype B clone based on the pAAV-MCS vector was constructed with the 1.3 fold HBV genome, resulting in the plasmid pAAV-HBV1.3 B and tested by HI in C57BL/6 mice. Application of siRNA against HBx gene was tested in HBV genotype B HI mouse model.",

Compared with pAAV-HBV1.2 (genotype A), the mice HI with pAAV-HBV1.3 B showed higher HBsAg and HBeAg expression as well as HBV DNA replication level but a higher clearance rate. Application of two plasmids pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285 expressing a small/short interfering RNA (siRNA) to the HBx gene in HBV genotype B HI mouse model, leading to an inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. However, HBV gene expression may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, suggesting that transient suppression of HBV replication by siRNA may be insufficient to prevent viral spread, particularly if the gene silencing is not highly effective.",

The laboratory mouse is genetically and immunologically defined, and a large collection of genetically modified animals exists. However, mice can not be infected with HBV. Several lines of transgenic mice with replication competent HBV genomes have been established and represented to be powerful tools for HBV research [5] . However, HBV replication in the transgenic mice is generated from the integrated HBV sequence harbored in all hepatocytes, which is different from what occurs during a natural infection [5] [6] [7] [8] . The presence of HBV genomes in these mouse lines inevitably induces immune tolerance to the HBV antigens. In addition, the capability of production of transgenic mouse model is not readily available in ordinary laboratory conditions. Transplant mouse models were established and used for different studies [9] [10] [11] . However, the models are based on immunodeficient mouse strains and difficult to handle in the laboratory.",

Figure 5B and C showed that pSR-HBxi285 inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg expression as well as HBV DNA in a concentrationdependent manner in the range of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcg.

Each group contained 10 mice. Initially, HBsAg levels in mice were significantly reduced by HI in the presence of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 plasmids at 1 dpi (p < 0.05), compared with the control groups receiving empty vectors ( Figure 6A ). However, the HBsAg levels in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice quickly increased during the follow up and reached the levels of the control at 14 dpi. In contrast, the HBsAg levels in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice were inhibited to a significantly lower degree before the 28 dpi compared with the control groups (p < 0.05). HBsAg became detectable in some mice at 42 dpi. It is worthy to note that the majority (7 of 10) of the mice received pSR-HBxi285 were HBsAg negative during the whole experimental period ( Table 2 ). HBV DNA concentrations in mouse sera were determined and were well correlated with HBsAg levels ( Figure 6B ). Figure 6C shows that the HBsAg positive rate in pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 treated mice was significantly decreased in comparison to the controls at 1 dpi. Thereafter, the positive rate of HBsAg in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice increased gradually and showed no significant difference in comparison to the control at 7 dpi. The positive rate of HBsAg in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice remained at a lower level (18.2-27.3%) than other groups until the 4th week post injection (wpi) but showed similar levels to the other groups in the 5th wpi. Consistently, immunostaining of HBcAg in the liver section of mice after HI demonstrated that the co-application of pSR-HBxi285 or pBS-HBxi285 abolished HBcAg expression in the mouse liver at 3 dpi ( Figure 6D ). However, HBcAg may become detectable in the mouse liver which received pSR-HBxi285 similar to those of control mice 4 weeks after HI. The results indicated that HBxi285 could significantly inhibit the HBsAg production and HBV replication. However the vector pSR-HBxi285 was more efficient in reducing HBsAg and HBV DNA levels than that of pSB-HBxi285.",

Nevertheless, the replication competence declined and could not reach the original level of HBV in nature infection state when the length is less than 1.2 fold of the HBV genome. Durantel et al. and other groups used 1.1 fold over length HBV genome for studies on drug resistant HBV isolates [32, 33] . However, they added strong foreign promoters to enhance the HBV transcription and replication. In conclusion, the 1.3 fold HBV genome length containing a complete extra copy of the entire EnhI, EnhII and HBx gene as described in the present study could be regarded as an optimal length for HBV replication constructs with the authentic HBV sequence, independent on a foreign promoter.",

Therefore, we further investigated the anti-viral effect of vector-expressed HBx siRNA in this model. Coapplication of the HBx siRNA expression plasmids treatment of these mice induced a significant inhibition of HBV replication and expression. When pAAV-HBV1.3 B was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice with either pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285, HBV expression and replication were efficiently inhibited. There are two methods commonly used to silence target genes. Chemical synthesized siRNAs have a good specificity and are commonly used on cells by transfection. However, such siRNAs, if not chemically modified, are instable and eliminated rapidly in vitro and in vivo. The production of siRNAs, particularly with specific chemical modifications, is very expensive. Another approach is to use siRNA transcription vectors. The disadvantages to use such as retroviral vectors are, for example, the lower transfection efficiency and slow action compared with chemical synthesized siRNA. However, the vector-based approach has some advantages regarding the stability and costs. It is important to prolong the expression of siRNAs to maintain the inhibition of HBV. Moreover, when the pSuper. Retro vector was transfected into a packaging cell line such as 293 T cell line, it could produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA) [39, 40] .",

The pSuper.Retro vector contains the H1 promoter which is a RNA polymerase III like promoter and can transcript shRNA steadily, and showed persistent inhibitory effect in vitro [46, 47] . The pSuper.Retro vector includes 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal LTR structure of murine stem cell virus. The pSuper.Retro vectors can be transfected into a packaging cell line to produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration. In addition, this vector contains an incomplete packaging signal and could not produce recombinant retroviruses (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA). pSuper.Basic is Figure 4 Specific T-cell responses to HBcAg epitopes in mice after HI.

The difference of both vectors in the gene silencing effects is likely due to their stability in vivo. HBx protein plays an important role in HBV replication and HBV induced HCC [26, 48] . Therefore, HBx became a good target gene for gene silencing in recent years. Importantly, as all HBV RNA transcripts share the same sequence in the HBx due to its unique transcription mechanism, siRNAs targeting the HBx region actually knock down all HBV RNAs, as shown in the previous studies [28, 49, 50] .",

            "text": "The result showed that the siRNA targeting the region nt 285-303 of the HBx coding region has a stronger antiviral effect than that targeting the region nt 314-332. It is known that siRNA-specific features such as low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3\u2032-terminus, lack of inverted repeats, and sense strand base preference, interaction with the cellular machinery called RISC and so on are likely to contribute to efficient RNAi process. The relative influence of these parameters is not fully understood and now under investigation by many groups [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . When pAAV-HBV1.3 B and pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice, HBV expression and replication could be significantly inhibited by the first week. Thereafter, the antiviral effect declined in the pSB-HBxi285 treated mice, whereas the antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi285 was maintained for at least 4 weeks. These results indicated that the retroviral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmid could much more effectively inhibit HBV expression and replication than the non-viral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmids. Among the mice which received pSR-HBxi285, HBV replication was completely suppressed in the majority of mice, as no HBsAg was detectable for the whole experimental period of 16 weeks. However, HBV gene expression and replication may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, indicating that transient suppression of HBV replication by HBx siRNA may also fail to clear HBV completely in some individuals. It is worth to mention that the change of serum HBsAg and HBV DNA in the mice after the application with HBx siRNAs occurred with different kinetics. The reason may be the different requirement of HBsAg translation and HBV DNA replication. It is well established that only a small fraction of HBsAg is required for virion production [57] . In the patients with chronic HBV infection, HBV DNA loads do not correlated with HBsAg [58] . Our results suggest that measures to prolong the antiviral effect of the siRNA should be investigated in future studies.",

The plasmid pUC-HBV containing a full length genotype B HBV genome (1820-3215-1824 nt, GenBank accession number: AY220698.1) was kindly provided by Prof. Jiming Zhang (Fudan University, China). The construction procedure of pBS-HBV1.1 B , pBS-HBV1.2 B and pBS-HBV1.3 B is shown in Additional file 1:Figure S1A. First, the large fragments of the genotype B HBV DNA nt 1658-3215-247, nt 1360-3215-247 and nt 1040-3215-247 were amplified by PCR with primers hbv1.1LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR (tagged with XbaI site), hbv1.2LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR, hbv1.3LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR, rsepectively. Those three fragments were inserted into the pBluescript II KS (+) (Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA) vector digested with PstI and XbaI. The small fragment of HBV DNA nt 247-1986 was amplified using primers hbvSF (tagged with XbaI site) and hbvSR (tagged with SacI site), and was inserted into the the pBluescript II KS (+) vector digested with XbaI and SacI. The resulting plasmids including nt 1658-3215-1986, nt 1360-3215-1986 and nt 1040-3215-1986 of HBV genome were named as pBS-HBV1.1 B , pBS-HBV1.2 B and pBS-HBV1.3 B, respectively. Schematic representation of the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold HBV genome are shown in Additional file 1:Figure S1B. All primers used to amplify HBV fragments are listed inTable 3. All DNA fragments in the final transfer vectors were amplified with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TAKARA, Dalian, China) and cloned into the commonly used, commercially available pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, USA) for PCR cloning and sequencing. The correctness of the sequences of cloned DNA fragments were confirmed by sequencing. To establish HI mouse model with a high positive rate of HBsAg, we cloned the 1.3 fold HBV genome into the vector including the backbone of adeno-associated virus, similar to the described procedure[12]. The HBV 1.3 fold over length genome DNA was amplified from pGEM-HBV1.3 B with primers hbv1.3 F (tagged with NotI) and hbv1.3R (tagged with NotI), and sub-cloned into the NotI site of the pAAV-MCS vector (Agilent technologies, La Jolla, USA). The resulting plasmid was designated as pAAV-HBV1.3 B . The construction procedure of pAAV-HBV1.3 B is shown in Additional file 1:Figure S1C.Cell culture and transfection Huh-7 cells (Human hepatocarcinoma cell line) were maintained in 1640 medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at approximately 60% confluence. After 24 h, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For pBS-HBV1.1 B , pBS-HBV1.2 B and pBS-HBV1.3 B , 0.8 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA and 2 \u03bcl of lipofectamine 2000 were placed in each well of a 24-well plate.The efficiency of our transfection procedure was verified and controlled by transfection of a GFP expressing vector, as described previously[59].To prove the antiviral effect of HBx siRNA, 0.5 \u03bcg of pAAV-HBV1.3 B and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSR-HBxi314 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells. The dose dependent antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi285 was tested by co-transfection of 0.5 \u03bcg pAAV-HBV1.3 B with 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSR-HBxi285 into Huh-7 cells. To compare the antiviral effects of pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285, 0.5 \u03bcg pAAV-HBV1.3 B combined with 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells in parallel.
