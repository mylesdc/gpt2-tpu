To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations. Methods. We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for acute asthma in 2016 in our Pediatric ED. Results. Visits for acute asthma were 603/23197 (2.6%). 76% of the patients were <6 years old and 24% \u22656. Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups; 33% of the school-aged children had a triggering allergic condition (versus 3% in <6 years; < .01). 191 patients had a previous history of asthma; among them, 95 were \u22656 years, 67% of whom were not using any controller medication, showing a higher risk of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than those under long-term therapy ( < .01). Exacerbations peaked in autumn and winter in preschoolers and in spring and early autumn in the school-aged children.",

Acute asthma exacerbations are one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) and for hospitalization in the pediatric age. In the United States, among asthmatic children nearly 60% have one or more acute exacerbations each year [2, 3] , and up to 20% require ED visits annually [4] . Moreover, asthmatic patients treated in the ED are at higher risk for future exacerbations and any single severe acute episode may progress to life-threatening respiratory failure [2, 5] .",

In the preschoolers (0-5 years old), acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways, whereas in the school-aged children (6 years and older) it usually signifies underlying asthma [6] and allergy. These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for asthma. In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September: this well-known entity is called the \"September asthma epidemics,\" coincides with the start of the school year, and is likely due to a combination of infectious, allergic, environmental, and climatic triggers [7] .

The importance of respiratory infectious agents, both viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus) and bacteria (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), in the development of asthma exacerbations has been stressed by several authors [11] [12] [13] [14] . The role of infections in acute wheezing is even more evident in the first years of life. Indeed, our results highlight that almost all the wheezing preschool-aged children had an underlying respiratory illness. On the other hand, one-third of the children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger, whereas in 10% the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit. In fact, several agents can elicit acute asthma: respiratory tract infections, environmental allergens, pollutants, and stress [14, 15] . Moreover, synergistic interactions between these factors might also very likely play a role [14] .",

Children frequently experience a worsening of asthma when they return to school after the summer break; the peak of this \"September asthma epidemics\" is around 2 weeks after the start of school [7, 14, 16] . In 2006, Johnston and Sears examined data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and found a clear seasonal pattern in ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma, showing, for the 5-15 years' age group, a relatively stable trend for the first 6 months of the year, a trough in the summer months, and then a rapid and substantial increase in mid-August, reaching the peak 2 weeks after return to school; in children aged 2-4, the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [16] . More recently, Cohen et al. analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for asthma were fluctuating during the first part of the year, had a decline in the summer months, and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [7] . Similarly to what is reported in the literature, our data show an increase in ED visits for asthma in early autumn, but with a difference between children aged 0-5 and \u22656 years (Figure 4 ). In the younger group, the peak starts in September, reaches its maximum in October, and then continues for the whole autumn and early winter. In the school-aged children, there is a peak only in September which is, however, lower than that observed during the spring, mainly in April and May.",

In the United States, there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden, such as school-based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines, but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that, despite these measures, the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [9] .",

Among this group of older children with known asthma, up to 2/3 were not using controller medications, either for no prescription or for low compliance, and, according to our results, were at higher risk of a moderatesevere exacerbation than those using it. Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma, and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma [21, 24] . Evaluating asthma severity was beyond the goals of our study; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 asthmatic children aged over 5 years and not using long-term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription. However, the fact that so many asthmatic children were not using controller therapy, although our National Health System provides a pediatricsspecialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14, seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of asthma management.",

Even if the guidelines do not state that ED physicians should identify children with persistent asthma and start long-term therapy, some authors suggest that, in appropriate patients, inhaled corticosteroids might be prescribed at ED discharge [24, 26] ; however, the rates of such prescriptions are low [25, 26] .",

In those who have had a recent exacerbation, resulting in admission to hospital, it may reduce readmission rates [31] . Quite recently, a survey was conducted among 277 pediatricians in 6 European countries to assess the care for asthmatic children in the outpatients' setting in terms of therapeutic education; it turned out that 80% of the sampled patients received a personalized action plan during the visit (83% in Italy) [32] . Several papers consider the availability of an individualized action plan among the interventions that can help reducing ED visits for acute asthma [2, 20, 21] . Some authors also suggest the use of electronic action plans that might be delivered to the patients at ED discharge [33] .",
