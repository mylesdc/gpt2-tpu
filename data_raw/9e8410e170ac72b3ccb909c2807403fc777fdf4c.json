Identifying animal reservoirs of zoonoses and predicting future outbreaks are increasingly important to human health and well-being and economic stability, particularly where research and resources are limited. Here, we integrate complex networks and machine learning approaches to develop a new approach to identifying reservoirs. An exhaustive dataset of mammal-pathogen interactions was transformed into networks where hosts are linked via their shared pathogens. We present a methodology for identifying important and influential hosts in these networks. Ensemble models linking network characteristics with phylogeny and life-history traits are then employed to predict those key hosts and quantify the roles they undertake in pathogen transmission. Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa. Host importance is further integrated into ensemble models to predict reservoirs of zoonoses of various pathogen taxa and quantify the extent of pathogen sharing between humans and mammals. We establish predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses, showcasing host influence to be a key factor in determining these reservoirs. Finally, we provide new insight into the determinants of zoonosis-sharing, and contrast these determinants across major pathogen taxa.",

Can we identify important host species and quantify their roles in sharing and transmitting different pathogen taxa?

These interactions formed a bipartite network with nodes represented hosts and pathogens, and links indicated whether pathogens have been found in hosts. We further checked these interactions to ascertain whether the putative pathogens caused a disease or an opportunistic infection in at least one species of mammal (including humans). This resulted in 16 548 species-level host-pathogen interactions between 3986 pathogen species (bacteria = 885, fungi = 251, helminth = 1000, protozoa = 404 and virus = 1446) and 1560 non-human mammalian species. We projected this bipartite network into a unipartite network where nodes represented host species and edges quantified shared pathogens. The motivation behind this projection is twofold: (i) it enabled us to investigate dynamics of pathogen sharing via ecological network analysis tools [9, 11] , and (ii) it facilitated identification of important non-human mammalian species via centrality measures. In addition to the network encompassing all pathogen taxa (including fungi), we generated eight additional networks: bacteria (including Gram variable), Gram+ bacteria, Gram\u2212 bacteria, helminths, protozoa, viruses (including retro-transcribing), DNA viruses and RNA viruses. Prions were not included in this study (electronic supplementary material, note S1 lists further information).",

We also calculated network-level E-I index based on species orders. Given a categorical node attribute describing mutually exclusive groups (in our case, order), the E-I index represents a ratio of external (with other orders) to internal (within order) edges. A positive network-level E-I index indicates a tendency of hosts to share pathogens with species outside their order (i.e. extrovert), whereas a negative E-I index indicates a tendency to share pathogens within orders (i.e. introvert).",

Each of these metrics reflects distinct characteristics of the roles host species play in shared-pathogen networks and tends to fall into wider categories including: degree and eigenvalue-derived measures, capturing direct sharing of pathogens among hosts; and distance-based measures, relating to indirect sharing of pathogens. However, due to the large number of available metrics in each category, determining which ones are best suited for identifying important hosts in networks is not straightforward. To address this, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the efficacy of a wide range of well-established centrality measures and subsequently select the ones best suited to our networks [22] . To achieve this, we computed seven degree- [23] [24] [25] and eigenvalue-derived [28-30] centrality measures, and six distance-based measures [24, 29, 30] in each of our networks. Electronic supplementary material, note S2 lists details and definitions of selected measures. We then performed PCA analyses using the R package FactoMineR [31] to determine the influence of our selected measures within each network. We calculated the contributions of each centrality measure to the first and second principal components (explained 89.6% of variance on average; first = 76.3%, second = 13.3%) to determine those which explained most of the variation in these components.",

Let us assume, for instance, that we have three mammalian species: A, B and C, and that A and B share 10 protozoan agents, whereas B and C share 5 protozoan agents. Here, we have two royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 287: 20192882 Table 1 . Network statistics. Zoonoses here refer to the number of pathogens found in at least one mammalian host species and humans in each network. Fields in italic represent values unchanged in the permutation tests (details of permutation tests are listed in electronic supplementary material, note S1). Modularity ranges from \u22121 to +1, with higher values indicating strong community structure within the network. Order E-I index also ranges from \u22121 (fully introvert) to +1 (fully extrovert). royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 287: 20192882 extreme scenarios, as follows. (i) The protozoans are all different; A and C do not share any protozoan pathogens, which in turn means that there is no flow of protozoan pathogens from A to C despite a path existing between the two (via B). (ii) The five protozoans shared by B and C are among the 10 shared by A and B and, therefore, half of A's protozoans are shared with C, and all of C's are shared with A. Both scenarios have implications on the traditional centralities analysed in the previous subsection. To address these issues, we developed a novel entropy-based metric, which we term indirect influence (II). II captures the influence each host species exercises within the unipartite network by measuring the number and frequency of pathogens this host spreads indirectly through its neighbouring species if it were to interact with each of them in isolation to the remainder of the network. Entropy enables us to capture uncertainties in the destination of pathogens as a function of the original host [33] at three levels: (i) a species which shares a few pathogens with many neighbours: entropy captures uncertainty in which neighbour it could influence indirectly; (ii) a species which shares many pathogens with few neighbours: entropy allows us to capture uncertainty in pathogens shared; and (iii) a species which shares many pathogens with many neighbours will have high centrality due to uncertainties in both pathogens shared and neighbours influenced. In addition, using entropy allows us to avoid assessing the many paths connecting all node pairs and instead, focus on the potential of the node (i.e. the host species) to diversify pathogen propagation [33, 34] .",

Our models to explain centrality (question 1) highlighted differences in traits associated with key species in each of our networks, as well as overarching general characteristics. Host species capable of sharing pathogens with distantly related species, and which harboured taxonomically varied pathogens, were more central due to being well connected with their neighbours (II and Opsahl degree). On the other hand, Opsahl betweenness was explained mainly by research effort, domestication status and geographical range.

This measure provided key insight into the probability of mammalian hosts sharing pathogens with humans (question 2). It suggested that, regardless of pathogen type, mammal species that can spread more of their pathogens indirectly through their neighbours are more likely to harbour zoonoses than other species. (ii) Our ensembles provided a flexible, robust, unbiased mechanism to address our questions. (iii) By investigating sharing of pathogens across multiple taxa and sub-taxa (e.g. DNA/RNA viruses, Gram+/Gram\u2212 bacteria), we were able to ascertain important differences in the mechanisms of sharing of different types of pathogens, and the effect this has on zoonoses. (iv) In addition, by integrating three measures of centrality, rather than focusing on a royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspb Proc. R. Soc. B 287: 20192882 single measure, we were able to differentiate key species in networks based on the unique characteristics of each network. This was highlighted where host species with higher betweenness carried more zoonotic viruses and bacteria, whereas hosts with higher Opsahl degree carried more zoonotic helminths and protozoa. (v) Finally, we were also able to differentiate the roles that host order and their domestication status play in different networks. We recognize several areas for future improvements of our models. First, our data were mined mainly from published research and deposited genetic sequences. While we made best effort to capture all interactions available within our resources [19] and to control for research effort as per previous studies [9, 12, 16] , we realize there are inherent biases in our data sources. Recent research has revealed that between 20 and 40% of pathogen host ranges are currently unknown [47] . An area of future improvement will therefore focus on closing this particular knowledge gap, furthering recent attempts to predict missing interactions in networks such as ours. Second, edges in our networks, which represent sharing of pathogens, may be interpreted in a variety of ways including: spillover; direct contact; indirect sharing through vectors, intermediate hosts or environment; and coevolution of specific host-pathogen lineages. To further improve our models, we will aim to distinguish between these various events, focusing in particular on the role of transmission routes as means to include direction of pathogen sharing into our undirected networks. Third, we have focused our analyses on host and pathogen species interactions with minimal geographical layering. Geography plays a key role in facilitating host interactions and affects the probability of contact between humans and wildlife, which in turn increases chances of zoonotic transmission [5, 48] . A future analysis will integrate geographical distribution of host species and will improve our ability to predict sources of zoonoses.",

It provided a methodology for selecting which centrality measure to include in analysis of similar networks. Our models revealed factors underlining centrality in these networks, and importantly how these factors vary across pathogen taxa. We established predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses and showcased centrality measures to be key in determining these reservoirs. Finally, we provided new insight into determinants of sharing of zoonoses between humans and mammalian hosts across major pathogen taxa.",
