The current status in many countries is to prepare influenza vaccine using cell-based or egg-based killed vaccine. However, traditional influenza vaccine platforms have several limitations. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms. One of the alternative approach, we reported the efficacy of influenza HA vaccination using a baculoviral DNA vaccine (AcHERV-HA). However, the immune response elicited by the AcHERV-HA vaccine, which only targets the HA antigen, was lower than that of the commercial killed vaccine. To overcome the limitations of this previous vaccine, we constructed a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope-coated, baculovirus-based, virus-like-particle (VLP)-forming DNA vaccine (termed AcHERV-VLP) against pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1). BALB/c mice immunized with AcHERV-VLP (1\u00d710 7 FFU AcHERV-VLP, i.m.) and compared with mice immunized with the killed vaccine or mice immunized with AcHERV-HA. As a result, AcHERV-VLP immunization produced a greater humoral immune response and exhibited neutralizing activity with an intrasubgroup H1 strain (PR8), elicited neutralizing antibody production, a high level of interferon-\u03b3 secretion in splenocytes, and diminished virus shedding in the lung after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus. In conclusion, VLP-forming baculovirus DNA vaccine could be a potential vaccine candidate capable of efficiently delivering DNA to the vaccinee and VLP forming DNA eliciting stronger immunogenicity than egg-based killed vaccines.",

The first cases were reported in Mexico and the United States in April, and by June, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a level 6 pandemic [5] . According to the WHO \"Global Alert and Response\" in 2010, this pandemic infected more than a million individuals and took 18,449 lives [6] .

In spite of the advantages of baculovirus, overcoming their lower efficacy relative to that of conventional vaccines remains a challenge [21] . We previously reported that a non-replicable baculovirus vector containing antigen-encoding DNA could serve as a nano-delivery system, and improve exogenous gene delivery into human cells by incorporating the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) on recombinant baculovirus [21] [22] [23] .",

In contrast to live viruses, VLPs are non-infective and non-replicating, since they are essentially devoid of pahogenetic material [24] . Moreover, VLPs have been known to enhance immunogenicity by presenting antigenic epitopes in correct conformation, resulting in strong humoral and cellular immune responses [24, 26, 27] . Given these advantages, VLPs have been widely used for vaccine development and other biomedical applications [28] .",

Correct insertion of each gene in recombinant baculoviruses was confirmed by PCR amplification from baculoviral genomic DNA (Fig 2A) . Sf9 cellderived baculoviruses containing HA gene or VLP forming genes (AcHERV-HA or AcHERV-VLP), were transduced into 293T cells. HA protein expression in virus-infected 293T cells was detected by western blotting (Fig 2B) . Protein expression in baculovirus-infected 293T cells was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using a mouse polyclonal antibody against pH1N1 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody ( Fig 2C) . Collectively, these results demonstrate that proteins were successfully expressed in 293T cells infected with baculoviruses. Influenza VLP formation in mammalian cells was confirmed by comparing negatively stained AcHERV-VLPs with wild-type pH1N1 (positive control) using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed largely spherical enveloped particles that were consistent with the 100-150 nm diameter (Fig 2D) .",

All experiments were run in triplicate. The data shown are actual number of IFN-\u03b3 spot as a scatter dot and mean value as a line. Statistical analysis showed that data were significant with p<0.05 (ANOVA and two-tailed Student's t-test): killed vaccine and AcHERV HA groups were compared with AcHERV VLP group. Previously, we reported on the efficacy of influenza HA vaccination using a HERV encoated-baculoviral DNA vaccine (AcHERV-HA) and showed that its immunogenicity and gene delivery were excellent [21] . Nonetheless, the fact of a vaccine that delivers only the HA gene could not be expected to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies has been questioned.",

Therefore, we here investigated mixed VLP forming combination of M1 gene from H5 strain (A/chicken/Vietnam/ OIE-2215/2012) with full length of HA and NA genes from H1 strain (A/CA/04/2009) and constructed a VLP-forming, gene-delivering, HERV encoated-baculovirus (AcHERV-VLP) that essentially kills two birds with one stone.",

Generally, VLP has an identical structure as a virus, and functions as a mimic antigen [24, 26] . Hence, the advantage of VLP vaccine has been described in conformational way; especially it presents more optimal neutralizing epitopes than that of HA only. Also, AcHERV-VLP includes M1 protein as a VLP component and recent publication indicates that M1 protein contains highly conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing cross-reactivity [37, 40] . Thus, AcHERV-VLP induced enhanced antibody response for both of homologous H1 and heterologous H1, whereas AcHERV-HA could not.",

The lack of correlation between H5 M1 gene mixed VLP and broad crossreactivity might suggests that combination of M1 gene from H5 strain with full length of HA and NA genes from H1 strain was not well-matched to induce broad-spectrum humoral immune response in our baculovirus DNA delivery system [39, 41] . Therefore, we sought the key to the enhanced breadth of the neutralizing spectrum of AcHERV-VLP is the inclusion of pivotal immunogenic genes. For example, it has been shown that addition of the extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) and several other HA genes can increase the breadth of neutralizing antibodies [42] [43] [44] [45] . IFN-\u03b3 screening in immunized mice showed that, AcHERV-VLP immunization induced stronger IFN-\u03b3 related cellular immune response in splenocyte than AcHERV-HA immunization, which indicates that VLP-forming baculovirus presented more T cell epitopes from NA and M1 proteins, and those epitopes triggered stronger cellular responses than that of HA only by stimulating with whole killed influenza virus (Fig 4. ) [38] . Th1 stimulating VLP forming DNA vaccine contains major T cell epitopes in VLP forming components. Not only HA but also influenza NA and M1 protein have conserved CD8+ T cell epitopes [46, 47] . Therefore, VLP forming AcHERV-VLP presented more T cell epitopes to cellular immune cells than HA protein targeted AcHERV-HA.",
