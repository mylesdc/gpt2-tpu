            "text": "Background: Diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are RNA viruses. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level. The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms, plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de Le\u00f3n (Le\u00f3n, Spain). Results: The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses. Kobuvirus and Rotavirus were more commonly reported, with Sapovirus, Astrovirus 3, 4 and 5, Enterovirus G, Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, Pasivirus and Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank, allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for Rotavirus B and Rotavirus C. Conclusions: Among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides, in a small number of cases Kobuvirus and Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role. Even most animals were co-infected in early life, the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear. The NGS method applied successfully characterized the RNA virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity.",

            "text": "Diarrhoea in neonatal piglets is a common problem in many pig herds. Usually, this condition is seen either in the offspring of gilts or as an epidemic problem affecting litters from sows of any parity. In the first case, the problem is usually attributed to an inadequate acclimation protocol for gilts while in the latter, the most often cause is the introduction of a new enteric pathogen. These patterns reflect the immune status of sows against the causing agents and the transfer of colostral and lactogenic immunity to piglets. The agents involved in neonatal diarrhoea of piglets are diverse and include bacterial (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, etc.) and viral pathogens (coronaviruses, rotaviruses, etc.). Less commonly neonates can suffer from diarrhoea caused by parasites [1] . Most of the viruses causing outbreaks of diarrhoea in neonate piglets are RNA viruses such as Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) or Rotavirus A, B, C or H (RVA, RVB, RVC, RVH) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Among them, Rotavirus A, B and C are a major cause of diarrhoea in pigs worldwide, having a significant impact in health and productivity, plus the potential of zoonotic transmission to humans [7] . The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route and large number of viral particles is excreted during Rotavirus infection. In contrast, other RNA viruses including Kobuvirus, Astrovirus, Sapovirus, Sapelovirus, Teschovirus, and Torovirus, have been detected in pig faeces but its role as causative agents of neonatal diarrhoea has not so far been fully elucidated [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . For instance, porcine Kobuvirus (KobuV) has been found frequently (16-99%) in faecal samples of pigs worldwide [15] . In some cases, the presence of the virus was associated with diarrhoea, but in others no significant differences between infection rates in healthy or diarrhoeic animals was found. Frequently KobuV were present concomitantly with other viruses making difficult a precise assessment of its role as agent of disease [12, 16] .",

Thus, when the number of reads for a given virus was compared to the total number of reads attributable to a mammalian RNA virus in the sample, it was evident that Rotaviruses, particularly RVA and RVB, clearly outnumbered any other virus that could be present (Fig. 1 ). In only nine cases, KobuV or SAV reads were predominant among viral reads (8 and 1 cases, Fig. 1 The box-and-whisker plots show, for the 47 samples from diarrhoeic animals, the distribution of the proportion of reads for a given mammalian viral species over the total number of mammalian viral reads (viral reads in a sample/total viral reads).

Interestingly, when mixed rotavirus infections were detected (RVA-RVC or RVB-RVC), the proportion of one virus clearly predominated against the other. When coupled with the viral load, the relative frequencies per virus (Fig. 2) showed that for a majority of cases (40/47, 85 .1%), the predominant virus in the sample represented read proportions higher than 0.5 and viral reads figures larger than 10E3. Nearly all of them (36/40, 90 .0%) corresponded to Rotaviruseither RVA (21), RVB (6) or RVC (9) -, with KobuV and SAV being much less frequent (3 and 1 cases, respectively). Besides, few cases (4 KobuV and 1 RVA) represented simultaneously high proportions with viral reads below 10E3.",

This value can be tentatively proposed as a cutoff for the assignment of an etiological agent.

            "text": "Our results agree with a number of studies that reported different Rotavirus species as agents of neonatal diarrhoea (reviewed in [7] ). One interesting observation from the present study is that coinfections or RVA-RVC and RVB-RVC was very common, suggesting the need for simultaneous testing all three agents in cases of neonatal diarrhoea. Regarding KobuV, our results also agree with an increased prevalence of this agent observed in cases of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide: Brazil [22] , Korea [29] and Vietnam [30] ; despite several (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 5 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the VP7 segment for Rotavirus B. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 58 reference sequences representing the 26 RVB VP7 genotypes described plus the 8 sequencesmarked with a circlereported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the 80% nucleotide cut-off value proposed by [25] ; accordingly, two new genotypes (labelled as GX1 and GX2 in the Figure) are tentatively proposed studies have observed non-significant differences in KobuV infection between diarrheic and healthy piglets in several European countries [12, 16, 31] . As mentioned above, two different patterns were observed in cases where KobuV was present: one with high proportion of KobuV reads and high number of viral reads, and others where these two circumstances were not fulfilled. The first pattern could correspond to clinical cases caused by Fig. 6 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the VP7 segment for Rotavirus C. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 34 reference sequences representing the 11 RVC VP7 genotypes described plus the 17 sequencesmarked with a circlereported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the 85-86% nucleotide cut-off value proposed by [26] ; accordingly, two new genotypes (labelled as GX1 and GX2 in the Figure) are tentatively proposed KobuV, while the second could correspond to secondary or concomitant infections by this agent. A similar pattern would apply to SAV. Regarding the other agents, since they were always in combination and their reads were not preeminent, its role must be seen as secondary at best. For instance, no differences in Astrovirus prevalence between diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets were reported [32, 33] , nor for Enterovirus prevalence between healthy and diarrheic pigs [30] . Interestingly, PEDV was seldom found in our samples and when found only traces could be detected. Prior to this, a higher frequency for this pathogen could be expected. However, while PEDV has caused recently severe epidemics in America [18] , in Europe the incidence seems to be much lower [34] . Of note is the total absence of TGEV, a virus which was widespread in Europe, but has consistently declined, or even disappeared, after the apparition and fast spread worldwide in the nineties of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus [35] . In any case, it is somewhat surprising to detect that many different viruses (up to seven in a single sample) in so young animals, even though the pattern was already observed in diarrhoeic piglets [21] . While it is easy to understand that the introduction of a new enteric virus in the farm will result in its rapid spread and the eventual development of an epidemic, it is more difficult to understand how so many viruses can be present in the maternities without generating a herd immunity resulting in colostral and lactogenic protection of suckling piglets. One possibility is that, most often, maternal immunity could be enough to limit the replication of those agents but not to completely prevent the infection; namely only provided partial immunity. In other cases, on farms reporting disease even in sows, RVA was present. This is compatible with its assumed role as primary agent. We have recently described the introduction of a new RVA strain that rapidly spread across pig farms in Spain and that was also present in the samples of this study as well [36] .",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the phylogenetic analyses for all the examined viruses indicated the existence of local clusters except for RVA (discussed above). This, together with the depth of the corresponding branches in the trees, suggested a long evolutionary history on a local basis. Certainly, we cannot discard the existence of other clusters for any of the reported viruses. However, the detection of several new genotypes for RVB and RVC plus the relative low nucleotide identity with other available (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 7 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of Porcine Sapovirus. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 37 reference genomes representing the 8 Sapovirus genogroups described so far in swine plus the 4 complete sequencesmarked with a circlereported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the classification proposed by [27] Fig. 8 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of Porcine Astrovirus 3. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains the 11 complete genomes available so far in swine plus the 2 complete sequencesmarked with a circlereported in this work sequences in GenBank reinforces the idea of local evolution at least for these two viruses. Moreover, with the results obtained we propose to define for RVB one new VP4 (P [6] ) and two new VP7 (G27 and G28) genotypes; as well as genotypes G14 and G15 for RVC. The geographical pattern observed in the RVB phylogenetic trees agrees with the notion that RVB genotypes may be specific for host species and region [25] . Regarding KobuV, no differences in the clustering pattern were observed between those strains coming from cases in which KobuV was predominant or not. This suggests that phylogenetic clustering probably is not predictive of virulence for this virus and most probably, other causes (i.e. immunity) are more relevant with regards to the clinical expression of the disease. Similarly, for SAV no differences were seen, and all isolates clustered together within genogroup III, the most commonly reported porcine SAV [37] .",

Although Kobuvirus was the most common virus detected, probably it was the primary agent of diarrhoea only in a small number of cases. Similarly, Sapovirus would be responsible of a single diarrhoea case. For the other examined viruses, the results indicated that many animals were infected in early life but the association with enteric disease was unclear. The NGS approach applied permit not only the detection RNA viruses present in a sample, but also to determine their relative abundances. This approach can be used for a more comprehensive diagnosis of neonatal diarrhoea and is useful for the examination of the RNA virome in faeces.",

Four samples from healthy non-diarrhoeic piglets were also included to be used as negative controls. In the cases studied, a bacteriological cause for the diarrhoea had been excluded after a microbiological culture for aerobes and anaerobes and molecular analyses (PCR for E. coli virulence factors and C. perfringens and C. difficile toxins). Only cases apparently unrelated (different farms with no evident connection) were included. Finally, 47 faecal samples, each one representing an outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in 47 farms from Catalonia, Castile and Leon, Aragon, Galicia and Valencia were analysed (Additional file 1).",

For the software programs used in steps iii), iv), vi) and vii) -FastQC\u00a9software, Kraken, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and QUASR, respectively -, the default parameters of every program were applied. Next, a database for every RNA species identified was constructed by downloading the available complete genome sequences from GenBank. Finally, the sequences obtained were aligned and phylogenetically compared with the datasets constructed for every complete genome, or segment in the segmented genomes identified. The phylogenetic relationships among sequences were analysed using the software MEGA7 [43] , by means of a Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm, using the matrix of pairwise p-distances and 10,000 bootstrap replicates to estimate the confidence of the internal branches of the trees.",
