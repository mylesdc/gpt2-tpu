            "text": "This study aimed at substantiating the associations of the apolipoproein M gene (APOM) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as with metabolic traits in Hong Kong Chinese. In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total-and LDL-cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese. However, in T2D patients, a subset of APOM SNPs was associated with disease duration and metabolic traits. Further molecular analysis proved the functional activity of rs707922 in APOM expression and in regulation of cellular cholesterol content.",

In human and mice, APOM mRNA is highly expressed in liver and kidney [2] . The human apoM protein (MIM 606907) of 188 amino acids is mainly associated with HDL and to a minor degree with LDL, very low density lipoprotein, and chylomicrons [2] . Plasma apoM has been positively associated with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) [3] . APOM knockdown in mice by siRNA revealed its anti-atherosclerotic effect by participating in pre-b HDL formation and reverse cholesterol transport [4] . Kruit et al., recently reported the effect of cellular cholesterol accumulation on beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes [5] . Such finding implies that factors (i.e., apoM) affecting the balance of cellular cholesterol content are likely to modify beta cell function and thus the susceptibility to or progression of type 2 diabetes.",

Therefore, in the subsequent haplotype analysis, rs707922 was used to 'tag' the three SNPs. Haplotype construction was conducted for rs707922(G+1837T) with other independent SNPs rs805297(C-1065A) and rs9404941(T-855C). Four haplotypes (A-T-G, C-C-G, C-T-G, and C-T-T) accounting for 99.9% of all possible haplotypes were detected in our Hong Kong Chinese population (Supplementary  Table S3 ). No significant association was found between these haplotypes with T2D. Homozygous C-T-T was significantly associatiated with elevated TC, LDL-C and HbA1c in T2D patients (p,0.0125, Supplementary Table S4 ). Figure S3) . SNPs rs707922 (G+1837T) and rs707921 (C+1871A) which associated with plasma levels of TC, LDL-C and apoM in T2D patients fell within the evolutionary conserved region. Figure 1 (top panel) illustrated the cross-species sequence conservation of the rs707922-and rs707921-flanking region. BLAST search using this conserved sequence as the template returned unique human EST clones BI757556 (human brain) and AA975560.1 (human kidney) which are likely other APOM transcripts. The Ensembl Browser also displayed three APOM transcripts (APOM1: Ensembl-ENST00000375916, APOM2: Ensembl-ENST00000375920 and APOM3: Ensembl-ENST00000375918). 4.2. Molecular cloning of APOM transcripts. Since the sequences of EST clones BI757556 and AA975560.1 were different than the known APOM transcripts, we proceeded with cloning alternative transcripts of APOM. A novel transcript, designated APOM5, was identified by 59 RACE and 39 RACE. As shown in Figure 1 , the 39 end of APOM5 was identical to the 39 end of APOM3. The 59 end, however, was similar to that of the vulgate APOM transcript (designated APOM1) except that the transcription start site of APOM5 was 21 nucleotides downstream that of the APOM1. The full-length sequence of APOM5 is provided in Supplementary Figure S4 . It is important to note that the two SNPs rs707922(G+1837T) and rs707921(C+1871A) associated with metabolic traits in T2D are located to the exon 5 of APOM5. On the contrary, when reference to the vulgate APOM1 transcript, rs707921 and rs707922 are located to intron 5. These observations support the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. ",

It is currently unknown whether this subset of SNPs is also associated with metabolic traits in Northern Chinese with T2D. Among the four common haplotypes constructed from rs805297, rs9404941, and rs707922, only homozygous haplotype C-T-T was significantly associated with higher TC, LDL-C and HbA1c levels in T2D patients. Given the established association between rs7070922 and plasma TC and LDL-C levels, these association results did not support additional effects of the haplotypes on serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, the association between the homozygous haplotype C-T-T with HbA1c indicated the interaction among the three alleles to control systemic glucose level in T2D patients. It would have been ideal if the previously reported association between SNP rs805296(T-778C) and T2D in Northern Chinese were reproduced in this Hong Kong Chinese population. Unfortunately, genotyping of this SNP failed to produce results in this study, precluding it being used for discussions attempting to reconcile the current findings with prior results.

Therefore, those 'susceptible to' the disease were not distinguished from those 'survived' the disease'. One possibility to circumvent such issue is to examine for similar duration of diabetes across studies being compared and test for difference in duration of T2D by SNP. Interestingly, while our results did not support an association between APOM and T2D susceptibility, stratification of our cases by disease duration allowed us to detect an association between rs805297(C-1065A) and T2D duration. This result implied the possibility that relative to the rs805297-A carriers, the rs805297-C carriers better survived the diabetic condition over the long term and such possibility can be further tested. Interestingly, Zhao et al., recently reported a positive association between rs805297-A and the risk of stroke in Norhtern Chinese (OR = 1.38, p = 0.002) after adjusting for other risk factors including history of diabetes [26] . Whether such association is present among the Southern Chinese requires further investigation. Nevertheless, losing rs805297-A carriers with T2D to stroke over time provides a plausible explanation for the observed higher frequency of rs805297-C allele in the T2D duration .10 years subgroup (relative to T2D duration #10 years subgroup).",

In this study, rs707922 homozygous minor allele (TT) was associated with elevated TC and LDL-C as well as plasma apoM levels in diabetic cases (average BMI of 25.26). These observations are consistent with previously reported positive association between plasma apoM and plasma TC and LDL-C in overweight-obese individuals [3] . Results presented by Han et al. from the study of a Northern Chinese cohort showed significant association between rs707922 T allele and increased risk of cerebral infraction (OR = 1.78, p = 0.000). In parallel they also confirmed hypercholesterolemia as an independent risk factor for cerebral infraction [25] . These results implied the possibility that rs707922 is also a modifier of serum cholesterol in Northern Chinese. The association between rs707922 TT genotype and elevated serum total-/LDL-cholesterol levels in type 2 diabetes found in the current report deserves to be further substantiated in strict replicate studies.",

            "text": "The mechanism underlying the effects of rs707922 on plasma TC and LDL-C levels in diabetes remains elusive. Richter et al., reported HNF-1 alpha being a potent transcription activator of APOM [28] . The decreased serum apoM level in maturity-onset diabetes of the young subjects as compared to the controls could be explained by the HNF-1 alpha mutations in these patients [28] . Given the association between APOM and metabolic traits found in this study, one may speculate that SNP rs707922 (G+1837T), in the capacity of an intronic SNP (reference to the APOM1 transcript), may modify APOM expression through SNP-specific recruitment of transcription factors (i.e., PAX 6 showed an allelespecific interaction with rs707922 T by computer prediction as presented in Supplementary Figure S5 ) and subsequently affect cellular cholesterol homeostasis in liver and possibly other tissues. More interestingly, we found that rs707922 can also assume the capacity as an exonic SNP (i.e., reference to the APOM5 transcript). While the function of APOM5 requires further elucidation, the high renal and hepatic expression levels of APOM1 and APOM5 indicated the possibility of these transcripts coordinate to regulate cholesterol homeostasis in these tissues. Such possibility is further supported by the results showing the activities of ectopically expressed APOM5 in modifying hepatic cell cholesterol content. With regards to systematic cholesterol homeostasis, we observed that homozygous rs707922-T allele associated with elevated total-and LDL-cholesterol levels. One possible mechanism of such elevation is through reducd hepatic and/or pheripheral clearance of circulating cholesterol. Consistent with this notion, our in vitro data showed that hepatic cells overexpressing APOM5-T transcript had lower cholesterol content relative to cells expressing the APOM5-G counterpart.",

While our results did not support an association between APOM and T2D susceptibility in Hong Kong Chinese, subgroup analyses found SNP as well as haplotype associations between APOM and metabolic traits in T2D. Bioinformatics/molecular analyses revealed the cryptic nature of exon 5 responsible for the expression of a novel transcript APOM5, predominantly in liver and kidney. The activity of APOM5 on modifying cellular cholesterol content revealed another layer of regulation underlying the expression and function of APOM. (Mus musculus; chr17) , rat (Rattus norvegicus; chr20), cow (Bos Taurus; chr23) and dog (Canis familiaris; chr12) genes are shown. Conserved sequences were defined as coding exons (blue), The Evolutionary Conserved Regions (ECRs) were indicated by pink lines (on top of the panel for each species) with a default value of 70%. The human APOM was depicted as a horizontal blue line above the graph, with strand/transcriptional orientation indicated by arrows. APOM coding exons were shown as blue boxes along the line, while untranslated regions (UTR) were indicated as yellow boxes. Peaks within the conservation profile which corresponded to these five exons of APOM were similarly coloured within the plot. Peaks within the conservation profile that did not correspond to transcribed sequences were highlighted in red colour. Regions of transposable elements and simple repeats were highlighted in green color.
