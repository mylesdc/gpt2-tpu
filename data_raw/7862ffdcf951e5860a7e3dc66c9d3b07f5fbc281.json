            "text": "A susceptibility locus for tuberculosis, a re-emerging infectious disease throughout the world, was previously discovered to exist on chromosome 11p15. IFITM3 gene encoding for interferon inducible transmembrane protein 3, is located at 11p15. It acts as an effector molecule for interferon-gamma, which is essential for anti-tuberculosis immune response. In order to investigate the association between susceptibility to TB and genetic polymorphisms of the IFITM3 core promoter, a casecontrol study including 368 TB patients and 794 healthy controls was performed in Han Chinese children in northern China. The rs3888188 polymorphism showed significant association with susceptibility to TB. The rs3888188 G allele, acting recessively, was more frequent in TB patients (95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.56, Bonferroni P-value: 0.039). We further assessed the effect of rs3888188 polymorphism on IFITM3 transcription in vitro. As based on luciferase promoter assays, the promoter activity of haplotypes with rs3888188 G allele was lower than that of haplotypes with rs3888188 T allele. Moreover, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells carrying rs3888188 GG genotype showed a reduced IFITM3 mRNA level compared to cells carrying TT or GT genotype. In conclusion, rs3888188, a functional promoter polymorphism of IFITM3, was identified to influence the risk for pediatric TB in Han Chinese population.

M. tuberculosis infects approximately one-third of the world's population. However, only about 10% of infected individuals eventually develop TB disease, whilst the majority of humans are naturally resistant to TB, indicating that host genetic factors play an essential role in determining TB susceptibility [1, 2] . Genetic variations in an increasing number of genes have been associated with human susceptibility to TB disease [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

Interferon gamma (IFN-c) is produced and released in response to the presence of pathogens [21] , it is secreted as a major cytokine to activate macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection [22] . Mutant mice lacking Ifng have weakened defense against M. tuberculosis [23] , and genetic variations in IFNG and its receptor, IFNGR, have been implicated in susceptibility to human TB [24, 25] . IFITM3 has been proven to be an important component of IFN-c signaling pathway, as down-regulation of IFITM3 via siRNA could largely reduce the anti-virus activities conducted by IFN-c [18] . Thus, IFITM3 is a potential candidate gene for TB susceptibility.",

In this regard, it is worth mentioning that Stein et al. previously found in a genome wide scan that one of the TB-linked loci was located in this chromosome region [26] . The core promoter region of human IFITM3 is enriched with regulatory elements (such as ISRE elements, the SP1-binding motif, and other regulatory sequences), and these are thought to be critical for its transcription [27] [28] [29] [30] . In this current study, we investigated the relationship between IFITM3 and susceptibility to TB via polymorphism analysis of its core promoter region around transcription start site. To determine whether or not these IFITM3 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to TB, its alleles and genotypes were analyzed in case-control study in Han Chinese pediatric population.",

The gold standard diagnosis of pediatric TB is made when M. tuberculosis is isolated. There were 42 bacteriology confirmed TB patients, in addition to their clinical signs/symptoms suggestive of TB, at least 1 M. tuberculosis positive culture from their sputum, which could be sampled from expectorated sputum, induced sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, gastric aspirates, or string tests (or other relevant intrathoracic samples) were obtained. In the absence of bacteriological confirmation, the diagnosis of pediatric TB is based on a triad of (1) clinical presentation (symptoms or signs); (2) imaging (chest radiography and computed tomography scan); (3) contact history (family, close contact); (4) purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test (using 5 TU); (5) positive clinical response to anti-TB therapy;(6)Except other lung disease, such as the various reasons pneumonia, lung tumor and so on. Clinical TB could be diagnosed if positive features of (1) plus (2) or (1) plus either two of (3)-(6) were present.",

Analysis of genotypic distribution of rs3888188 using 362 x2 test revealed significant difference between TB group and control group (Bonferroni P = 0.013). No statistical differences were observed between PTB and EPTB subgroups (data not shown). Further, a 262 x2 test was used by combining different genotype combinations to test dominant (GG+GT versus TT) and recessive (GG versus GT+TT) models of inheritance. The OR for the G allele of rs3888188 as a possible risk factor was 1.58 (95%CI: 1.32-1.89, P = 5.30e-007) under a recessive model and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.87-1.45, P = 0.384) under a dominant model. Thus, a Mendelian recessive trait was accepted for the inheritance pattern.",

This has been demonstrated through down-regulation of IFITM3 via siRNA, which reduced IFN-c antiviral activity by 40-70% [17] . IFN-c is thought to be essential factor acting against different infectious agents including tuberculosis. Successful immune reaction against M. tuberculosis requires strong IFN-c signaling. As such, IFITM3 is a potential candidate gene for TB susceptibility. Thus, we speculated that IFITM3 might have a clear influence on the occurrence of TB. Until now, no data on the IFITM3 genetic polymorphisms were published for Han Chinese population. As promoter variation might influence gene expression, we initially investigated the association of polymorphisms in the core promoter region of IFITM3 with TB in a subset of the pediatric population of Han Chinese ethnicity. This case-control study showed the rs3888188G allele to be linked to the increased risk of TB. In genetic studies, the power of a sample set to detect an association greatly depends on the allele frequency and the size of its effect [34] . In our study, a power to detect an effect for rs3888188 was calculated to be high (99.6%) under the sample size used. The frequency of the rs3888188 G allele in TB group was significantly higher than that in the control group after Bonferroni correction and a recessive model of inheritance was found significant. Besides, the frequency of GTT haplotype (that contains rs3888188 G allele) was significantly higher in TB patients than in controls while the frequency of TTC haplotype (rs3888188 T allele) was significantly lower in TB patients than in controls. Since the IFITM3 gene is located at 11p15.5, these findings may also support the identification of the TB-susceptibility locus at 11p15 suggested by the genome scan [26] .",

We also noticed that lymphocytes carrying the rs3888188 GG genotype had significantly lower IFITM3 mRNA level compared with cells carrying other two genotypes (TT plus TG). These observations indicated that insufficient transcriptional activity of IFITM3 could be a risk factor for TB susceptibility and that IFITM3 has a protective role against TB.

IFITM3 participates in the lysosomal pathway and was shown to limit viral replication at a late stage of endocytosis [18] , as IFITM3 overexpression lead to the expansion of enlarged acidified compartments consisting of lysosomes. Previously, lysosome related genes, such as SLC11A1 (encoding solute carrier family 11 member 1, a lysosome membrane protein) [36] and IRGM (encoding immunity-related GTPase family M, mediating fusion of M. tuberculosis-contained endosome with lysosome) [37] , were proven to be associated with TB susceptibility. Lysosomal pathway plays an important role in TB pathogenesis [36, 37] , it may directly determine the successful elimination of M. tuberculosis by macrophages or the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages. As sufficient expression of IFITM3 effectively restricted infection by influenza virus [16, 17] , vesticular stomatitis virus [18] , filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus [16] , sufficient expression of IFITM3 might also be critical in reducing survival of M. tuberculosis.",
