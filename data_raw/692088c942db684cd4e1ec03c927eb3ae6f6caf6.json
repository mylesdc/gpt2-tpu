Among the 117 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 59 had predisposing factors. In patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was over-presented (OR = 1.652, 95% CI [1.02-2.67]; P = 0.039) and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was underpresented (OR = 0.542, 95% CI [0.33-0.90]; P = 0.016) in comparison with control group. In cryptococcal meningitis patients without predisposing factors, FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was also more frequently detected (OR = 1.958, 95% CI [1.05-3.66]; P = 0.033), and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was also less frequently detected (OR = 0.467, 95% CI [0.24-0.91]; P = 0.023) than in controls.

FCGR2A 131H/H was reported to contribute to higher risk of bacteremia in pneumococcal CAP patients [13] . Another study showed that HIV-infected patients with FCGR2A 131R/R genotype progressed to a low CD4 + cell count at a faster rate, but conversely in individuals carried FCGR2A 131H/H there was an increased risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [14] . FCGR3A 158F/V gene polymorphism was not associated with progression of HIV infection, but predicted the risk of Kaposi's sarcoma [14] . A study on infections during induction chemotherapy found that FCGR2A 131H/H was associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia, FCGR3B NA1/NA1 associated with infections, and FCGR3A polymorphisms not associated with infections [15] . Sadki et al. investigated the influence of FCGR3A 158V/F and FCGR2A 131H/R polymorphisms on susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in the Moroccan population but no association was found [16] . A study in East Africa found that the FCGR2B 232T/T genotype provided protectiveness for children against severe malaria [17] .",

            "text": "In our study, we found for the first time that cryptococcal meningitis was associated with the FCGR2B 232I/T genotypes, which was not reported in Metediatis' study. As the only known inhibitory FccR, FccRIIB has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, and thus it plays an important role in regulating the immune system [40] . FCGR2B 232I/T is located in the transmembrane domain, and the FccRIIB receptors encoded by FCGR2B 232T are unable to interact with activating receptors and exert inhibitory activity [38] . Published data have suggested the mutation genotype FCGR2B 232T/T to be a susceptible genotype for systemic lupus erythematosus [17, 22, 32] , and this genotype also provided protective effect for severe malaria in East African children [17] . The role of FccRIIB in cryptococcal infection is still not very clear. Like the activatory FccRs, FccRIIB can also recognize the major component of the capsule of C. neoformans, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). In a previous study by Monari et al., the immunosuppressive effect of GXM was demonstrated to be dependent on FcRcIIB, based on the evidences that FccRIIB blockade inhibits GXM-induced IL-10 production and induces TNF-a secretion, and that the addition of monoclonal antibody to GXM reverses GXM-induced immunosuppression by shifting recognition from FccRIIB to FccRIIA [41] . Another study subsequently demonstrated that GXM triggered NO-induced macrophage apoptosis, which was dependent on FccRII [42] . These data support that FccRIIB plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infection. In our study, it is the FCGR2B 232I/T heterozygote instead of the minor homozygote 232T/T that is under-presented in patient group. One study on children with idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) also showed a similar pattern, that the FCGR2B 232I/T was less frequently detected in acute ITP in comparison with chronic ITP [27] . The reason for the heterozygotes 232I/T rather than 232T/T under-presenting in our patients and those acute ITP children has not been clarified.",

The cause for discrepant results may be multifactorial. One was the ethnic differences between the two studies. Subjects in our study were of Chinese Han ethnicity, while the majority of subjects in Meletiadis' study were Caucasians (60%). As a matter of fact, the FCGR3A 158V allele was significantly increased only in patients who were Caucasian in Meletiadis' study. Secondly, all the cases in our study were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, while some patients from Meletiadis' study were cryptococcosis without central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, both studies had relatively small sample sizes, which could be underpowered to generate positive results.",

Patients who met at least one of the following criteria were considered as proven cryptococcal meningitis: (1) Isolation of C. neoformans from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by culture or positive India ink smear, and (2) compatible histopathological findings, which are 5-10 mm encapsulated yeasts observed in brain tissue. Patients who had no microbiological or pathological documentation but present with positive cryptococcal antigen titer ($1:10) in CSF and met at least one of the following criteria were regarded as probable cryptococcal meningitis: (1) abnormal laboratory tests or an increased open pressure ($200 mmH 2 O) of CSF, (2) abnormalities of cranial imaging (Computerized Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which could not be explained by other factors, and (3) comorbidities that compromise the host immune system. Cryptococcal antigen was determined using diluted CSF with the Latex-Cryptococcus antigen detection system (Immuno-Mycologics). Patients and volunteers were assessed for predisposing factors as follow, immunocompromising diseases (liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, solid organ transplantation) [2, 3, 43] , and corticosteroid (at prednisone equivalent dose of .0.3 mg/kg/day of for .3 weeks) or immunosuppressive medications (within 90 days before onset of cryptococcal meningitis) [44] , and idiopathic CD4 + T lymphocytopenia (unexplained CD4 + T lymphocytopenia with CD4 + T lymphocyte count ,300 cells/mm 3 ) [45] . Diabetes mellitus was also included, although this common condition is a controversial predisposing factor [3, 46] . Patients without any of the above mentioned predisposing factors were considered as apparently healthy hosts. Ten volunteers were excluded because of disclosed predisposing conditions, and the remaining 190 healthy volunteers were included in the control group.",
