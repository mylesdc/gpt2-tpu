Carnivore RABVs originated from two historical host shifts from bat viruses. To reveal the genetic pathways by which bat RABVs changed their host tropism from bats to carnivores, we investigated the second permanent bat-to-carnivore shift resulting in two carnivore variants, known as raccoon RABV (RRV) and south-central skunk RABV (SCSKV). We found that their glycoprotein (G) genes are the result of recombination between an American bat virus and a carnivore virus. This recombination allowed the bat RABV to acquire the head of the G-protein ectodomain of the carnivore virus. This region is involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to changes in the pH microenvironment, trimerization of G proteins, and cell-to-cell transmission during the viral infection. Therefore, this recombination event may have significantly improved the variant's adaptability to carnivores, altering its host tropism and thus leading to large-scale epidemics in striped skunk and raccoon.",

Before the 1970s, rabid raccoons were limited to the southeastern United States 15 . Following the detection of RRV in West Virginia in the 1970s, however, the distribution of rabid raccoons has spread at an alarming rate, becoming an epizootic that affects many thousands of square kilometers in North America 15, 16 . Until 1998, raccoons have had the highest incidence of rabies of all species in the United States 17 .

Of these, G is inserted into the envelope and is responsible for viral attachment to the host cell surface, receptor binding, and membrane fusion 19 . In addition, G also influences viral pathogenicity and neurotropism 20 , inducing the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies 21 . Thus, the G protein clearly plays a key role in determining RABV infection and adaptation to the host. In this study, we dissected the phylogenetic history of the G genes of SCSKV and RRV and found that they are recombinants stemming from the same recombination events. The key genetic component responsible for receptor binding in RRV and SCSKV derives from a carnivore RABV, while the remaining half of the gene derives from a bat RABV. Therefore, the homologous recombination (HR) event appears to have allowed the bat RABV to rapidly adapt to a carnivore host, initiating an epidemic among the carnivores of North America.",

This virus has the capacity to infect almost all mammals. Although RABV is usually maintained in distinct host species-associated transmission cycles, typically within the Carnivora and Chiroptera [5] [6] [7] , host shift events are still of public health concern due to increasing risks of human exposures 7 . Recent host shifts between carnivores include the re-emergence of RABV in wild Taiwan ferret-badgers 8 , as well as the outbreaks of domestic dog-associated RABV in Ethiopian wolves 9 and of striped skunk-associated RABV in gray foxes in California 10 . It has also been reported that multiple host shifts between bat and mesocarnivores have occurred with the big brown bat-associated RABV in Arizona 11 . In South America, the vampire bat, a reservoir of RABV, is resposible for the high number of rabies cases among terrestrial mammals in the rural cycle 12 .

We initially compared all of the variable sites in the A09-255, CA, and LAH60 G genes and discovered two crossover sites. Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 shared higher similarity with the carnivore virus, while outside of this region, A09-255 exhibited higher sequence identity with the bat RABV (Fig. 1A ). Comparison of a complete RRV genome with the bat and carnivore RABVs also demonstrated a similar G gene pattern (see Additional File 4). Bootscan analysis of the G gene with an outgroup (Lagos bat viruses 8619NGA and 0406SEN) indicated that this discordant sequence likely derives from HR. Two crossover sites were also identified in the bootscan analysis (Fig. 1B) . Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 was found to be homologous to carnivore RABVs, while it was more similar to bat RABVs outside of this region. Taken together, these results suggest that the G gene of SCSKV likely underwent a recombination event, resulting in the two breakpoints. Using the three representative isolates, the recombination event was further examined through seven recombination analysis methods implemented in the RDP software package, which properly allows for statistical analysis of the probability of recombination (Fig. 1C) .",

The incongruent origins of the recombinant lineage were also reflected in the different topologies of the two Bayesian trees (Fig. 4) . The resulting trees estimated that the tMRCA of the recombinant was 254 (95% highest probability density, HPD: 133-491; Fig. 4A ) or 280 (95% HR resulted in rapid evolution of the bat RABV G protein. Finally, we compared the amino acid sequences of the G proteins of the recombinant lineage and its parent lineages and found 17 positions between the two putative breakpoints where the recombinant is more similar to the carnivore RABV (see Additional File 5). We also assessed d N /d S ratios employing Datamonkey 36 and found no positively selected sites along the stem branch of the recombinant lineage at a 10% significance level. However, in the recombinant sequence of RABV following the host switch, the non-synonymous substitution rate is up to 6% (versus 0.4% in the same region of the virus without recombination and remaining associated with bat host).

In retroviruses, HR between viruses from different primate hosts is associated with the emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus 39 .

Since recombinant offspring have not yet been found circulating in bat, the recombination may have occurred instead in a terrestrial animal infected by the carnivore RABV parent when the bat virus (the major parental strain) infection occurred. Considering that SCSKV is more closely related to the MRCA of the recombinant variant than the raccoon sub-lineage (Fig. 2) , an American striped skunk is the most likely candidate host for the co-infection and recombination (Fig. 5C) . Future studies should attempt to determine which particular cell types are the most likely host cells for the recombination event in striped skunk.",

After binding to a receptor, RABV enters the host cell through the endocytic pathway and subsequently fuses with a cellular membrane within the acidic environment of the endosome 46 . Both receptor recognition and membrane fusion are mediated by the G protein, which is trimeric and forms spikes that protrude from the viral surface 47 . In the mosaic G protein, almost all functional sites directly related to host tropism and infectivity are located in the region derived from the carnivore RABV (positions 181 to 431 of the G protein). For example, neuroinvasiveness and receptor binding is known to be associated with lysine (Lys) 48, 49 and arginine (Arg) 20, 50 residues present at positions 330 and 333, respectively. In addition, a recent study suggested that positions 242, 255, and 268 affect the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission of the viral infection 51 . Interestingly, we found that Arg333 of the carnivore RABV replaced Lys333 of the putative major parental strain, LAH60 (see Additional File 5). These changes may lead the recombinant offspring to be better adapted to the new host species than to bats.",

Although a 3D structure of a RABV G protein is not available, three of the four major antigenic sites/epitopes (I/CR57, III, and IV) are derived from the American carnivore RABV, reflecting the fact that the recombinant region is exposed on the outside of the G protein 3D structure (Fig. 5A ). In addition, the mosaic protein structure can also be estimated by studying the G protein of a bullet-shaped virus family member, vesicular stomatitis virus 47 (Fig. 5B) . Among the four functional domains of the mosaic G protein ectodomain (I, lateral domain; II, trimerization domain; III, pH domain; and IV, fusion domain), the parental bat RABV only provided domain IV (residues 53-172, Fig. 5A ), which mainly constitutes the stem of the hairpin conformation of the trimeric G protein (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, almost all of domains I, II, and III are derived from the parental carnivore RABV (Fig. 5A) , forming 84% of the G protein head (Fig. 5B) . These domains are involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to pH changes, and G-protein trimerization 47 . It has been reported that mutations in the pH domain affect the structural transition of the G protein 52 and therefore may alter the ability of RABV to escape antibody neutralization 53 and to infect cells 54 . Thus, after acquiring these key genetic elements from skunk RABV, the mosaic offspring could have rapidly adapted to permanent residence in the new host species.",
