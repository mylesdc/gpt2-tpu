Although previous studies described the genome characterization of Group C orthobunyavirus, there is a gap in genomic information about the other viruses in this group. Therefore, in this study, complete genomes of members of Group C serogroup were sequenced or resequenced and used for genetic characterization, as well as to understand their phylogenetic and evolutionary aspects. Thus, our study reported the genomes of three new members in Group C virus (Apeu strain BeAn848, Itaqui strain BeAn12797 and Nepuyo strain BeAn10709), as well as re-sequencing of original strains of five members: Caraparu (strain BeAn3994), Madrid (strain BT4075), Murucutu (strain BeAn974), Oriboca (strain BeAn17), and Marituba (strain BeAn15). These viruses presented a typical genomic organization related to members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Interestingly, all viruses of this serogroup showed an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the putative nonstructural NSs protein that precedes the nucleoprotein ORF, an unprecedented fact in Group C virus. Also, we confirmed the presence of natural reassortment events. This study expands the genomic information of Group C viruses, as well as revalidates the genomic organization of viruses that were previously reported.",

This name is historically based on their serological characteristics, which makes them distinct from members of group A (Alphaviruses genus of the family Togaviridae) and group B (Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae) antigenic groups [2] . Currently, the group C serogroup is composed of 15 distinct viruses isolated from humans, wild animals (mainly rodents, monkeys, marsupials, and bats), and mosquitoes. These viruses are present in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, including the United States, Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Trinidad, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and French Guiana [1, 3, 4] .",

            "text": "Our results showed that the complete SRNA segments of Group C viruses ranged from 1,003 to 1,111 nucleotides (nt) and presents the open reading frame (ORF) of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, with a conserved size of 235 amino acids (aa) and 26.72 to 27.03 kDa for all viruses (Fig 1) . The second ORF in the S segment in these viruses encodes a putative non-structural protein (NSs). Interestingly, the ORF to NSs gene starts at an ATG codon -38 nucleotides downstream of the N ORF start codon, which potentially encodes an NSs protein of 318 nt (105 aa) with a molecular mass of~11.8 kDa (Fig 1) . The NSs protein is common in most orthobunyaviruses that have been isolated from vertebrates, such as the members of Group C viruses [19] . Previously studies have been reported that Caraparu and Madrid from Group C viruses encode an NSs protein with 83 amino acids, and also a 62 aa NSs, predicted to be truncated in the N-terminus of Marituba and Oriboca viruses, and consequently, could not be expressed [6, 7, 9] . Indeed, our analysis demonstrates that possibly the members of Group C viruses present a pre-N coding strategy, as recently described for the Brazoran and Enseada orthobunyaviruses [20, 21] . Therefore, some S segment sequences previously reported for Group C viruses are possibly incomplete, as shown in Fig 2. Whereas that NSs protein has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in virulence and pathogenesis of Orhobunyaviruses [19] , further studies using reverse genetics may elucidate the biological importance of NSs protein found in viruses of Group C. The complete MRNA segments ranged from 4,534 to 4,613 nt in length, which encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), ranging from 1,428 to 1,435 aa in length (159.94 to 161.87 kDa) with a similar topology to other members of the Orthobunyavirus genus (Fig 1) . The GPC is proteolytically cleaved to yield two structural glycoproteins, Gn (204 to 211 aa and 34.01 to 35.13 kDa) and Gc (942 to 947 aa and 100.45 to 102.8 kDa), and a nonstructural protein (NSm) with 281 or 282 nt (24.99 to 26.27 kDa) (Fig 1) . The GPC contains the specific N-terminal signal peptide that is common to all members of the genus, which is responsible for delivering the nascent polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum [22] . The conserved Zinc finger region (amino acids position 257 to 295) and fusion peptide (amino acids position 1068 to 1091) in the GPC protein were also identified, which is an important RNA binding site and is probably involved in viral assembly [23] . Furthermore, the GPC was predicted to contain five transmembrane regions (TMDs): a single TMD in Gn (close to the C-terminus); three TMDs in NSm; and a single one, close to the C-terminus in Gc (Fig 1) . The TMDs in Gn and Gc have been shown to play crucial roles in membrane fusion, assembly, and morphogenesis [24] .",

These groups were named following previous serological classifications based on complement fixation, neutralization, and hemagglutination inhibition tests: Marituba, Caraparu, Madrid and Oriboca complexes (Fig 3B) [1, 27] . The Caraparu complex includes CARV, APEUV and BRUV, Madrid complex comprises MADV and ITYV, Marituba complex comprises MTBV, MURV, RESV, NEPV and GLV, and the Oriboca complex was composed by ORIV and ITQV [1] . Unfortunately, there are no complete sequences available to Vinces and Ossa viruses, but probably these viruses will be clustered into Caraparu complex as previously showed by serological assays [28] . Possibly, the concordance observed between the phylogeny of the M segment and the serological classification occurs because the M segment encodes the glycoproteins, which are the primary antigenic determinants recognized by the neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests [1, 29] .",

            "text": "Reassortment is an important evolutionary mechanism of segmented RNA viruses in which co-infection of a host cell with multiple viruses may result in the shuffling of genomic segments [30] . This fact has been shown to be involved in virus emergence and interspecies transmission, which include Schmallenberg and Oropouche virus [31] [32] [33] . In Group C viruses, a classic and informative study using standard antigenic tests showed cross-reactivity in Marituba and Murutucu by hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization, Murutucu and Oriboca by complement-fixation, Oriboca and Itaqui by hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization, Itaqui and Caraparu by complement-fixation, Caraparu and Apeu by hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization and Apeu and Marituba by complement-fixation [27] . However, some these viruses cross-reacted completely by one test, but not by another test and still are related. Thus, these and other data indicated that the Group C viruses include many natural reassortants [34] . To elucidate this point, we compared the topology of both S and L trees with the phylogenetic tree generated using the M segment sequences and observed some discrepancies, which were supported by higher bootstrap values and significantly different likelihood scores, which suggested natural reassortment. Also, after combining these branching inconsistencies in the phylogenetic trees with RDP4 analyses of concatenated segments, we confirmed four reassortment events with different genome segment organization than previously described [1, 7] . The first reassortment event was identified in APEUV strain BeAn848 contains S and L segments from MTBV strain BeAn15 and an M segment that is probably unique. Also, ITQV strain BeAn 12797 has S and L segments from CARV strain BeAn3994 and a possibly unique M segment. Interestingly, based on the classification of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the reassortment events described in this study occurs between different viral species, as the Apeu virus that is classified into Caraparu orthobunyavirus, but the S and L this virus is from Marituba orthobunyavirus. Also, the Itaqui and Oriboca viruses are classified into Oriboca orthobunyavirus, but the S and L segments of both viruses are from viruses of Caraparu orthobunyavirus. Despite, previous studies based on serological tests and partial genome sequences indicated that APEUV and ITQV are potential reassortments, the first complete coding sequences for three segments were reported in this study [1, 7, 9, 34] . The other reassortment event was observed in ORIV strain BeAn17, which possesses the S and L segments from MURV strain BeAn974, and a unique M segment (Fig 4) . Interestingly, all reassortments observed in this study have been reported cross-reactions only by the complement-fixation method [27] . This fact, suggests that cross-reactivity observed by complement-fixation test was determined by S segment because serologic makers identified by the L segment remains unidentified, as well as hemagglutination-inhibition, and neutralization assay that is determined by M segment, therefore, these viruses probably are unique [34] . Also, we confirmed the reassortments in ITYV identified in Amazon Region of Peru in 1999, both strains of this virus have S and L segments from Caraparu virus and a unique M segment [4] . On the other hand, MURV and RESV were previously reported to be reassortments, but we did not find any evidence to support this phenomenon [1] . Additional studies, as well as other strains of Group C viruses, may help to clarify this point.",
