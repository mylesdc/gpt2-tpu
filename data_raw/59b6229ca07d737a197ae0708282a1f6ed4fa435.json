We have previously shown that DNA vaccine priming increases the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to H5N1 monovalent inactivated boost. We now report the safety and immunogenicity of a H7 DNA-H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine prime-boost regimen. In this Phase 1, open label, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated three H7N9 vaccination regimens in healthy adults, with a prime-boost interval of 16 weeks. Group 1 received H7 DNA vaccine prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine boost. Group 2 received H7 DNA and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a boost. Group 3 received H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine in a homologous prime-boost regimen. Overall, 30 individuals between 20 to 60 years old enrolled and 28 completed both vaccinations. All injections were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. 2 weeks post-boost, 50% of Group 1 and 33% of Group 2 achieved a HAI titer \u22651:40 compared with 11% of Group 3. Also, at least a fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody responses was seen in 90% of Group 1, 100% of Group 2, and 78% of Group 3 subjects. Peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers were significantly greater for Group 1 (GMT = 440.61, p < 0.05) and Group 2 (GMT = 331, p = 0.02) when compared with Group 3 (GMT = 86.11). A novel H7 DNA vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic when boosted with H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine, while priming for higher HAI and neutralizing antibody titers than H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine alone.",

As of March 22, 2017 , 1349 laboratory confirmed cases of H7N9 with 497 deaths (36.8%) have been reported. 5 Pandemic influenza can arise from a reassortment event in which two or more influenza viruses exchange genetic material and/or via direct spread from animals to humans of an influenza virus that has adapted to spread in humans. 6, 7 While sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9 has not been reported, several factors suggest H7N9 has pandemic potential. These include the absence of baseline immunity to H7N9 in humans; 3, 8 presence of genetic markers associated with human adaptation such as Q226L in the HA gene and an E627K substitution in PB2 (ref. 4); evidence of transmission through direct contact and airborne exposure in a ferret model; 9 and evidence that H7N9 not only can replicate in human airway epithelial cells, but also achieves higher peak viral titers in human bronchus and lung than other avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 (refs. 10, 11) .",

H7 HA may be intrinsically poorly immunogenic and candidate H7 vaccines have historically generated limited immune responses. [13] [14] [15] While poorly immunogenic on their own, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) for H7N7 have been shown to effectively prime the immune system for an H7N7 inactivated influenza boost. 16 Similarly, a candidate H7N9 LAIV primed for robust antibody responses following an antigenically matched inactivated boost. 17 DNA vaccines induce both cellular and humoral immunity, can be manufactured rapidly, and have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in vaccine regimens against influenza, HIV, Ebola, SARS, and West Nile Virus. [18] [19] [20] [21] We have previously shown that a DNA vaccine encoding H5 increased the magnitude and quality of antibody responses when used as a priming vaccine prior to H5N1 monovalent inactivated boost. [22] [23] [24] A DNA vaccine encoding H7 was subsequently developed and shown to provide protection from H7N9 lethal challenge in pre-clinical testing in mice (unpublished data). Herein, we report on the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost regimen consisting of H7 DNA followed by a H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV) boost. In a prior phase 1 clinical trial, H7N9 MIV was found to be safe but poorly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvant. 25 We consequently evaluated the ability of this prime-boost regimen to improve H7-specific HAI titers and neutralizing antibody responses.",

H7-specific antibody responses were assessed at week 18 (2 weeks following the 16 week H7N9 MIV boost). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc t-test indicated statistically significant differences in HAI titer across the three groups at week 18 (p = 0.03 for the Anhui antigen and p = 0.02 for the Shanghui antigen). The magnitude and frequency of HAI responses was greater in group 1 (DNA prime-MIV boost) and group 2 (DNA/MIV prime-MIV boost) than in group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), indicating H7 DNA primed for a better HAI response than H7N9 MIV (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). Two weeks following the boost, peak GMT were higher in those receiving H7 DNA prime (groups 1 and 2) rather than H7N9 MIV prime alone (group 3), and this difference reached significance between groups 1 and 3 (33.8 vs. 8.3, p = 0.02) for the Anhui antigen and between groups 1 and 3 (24.6 vs. 5.8, p = .01) and groups 2 and 3 (14.7 vs. 5.8, p = 0.03) for the Shanghai antigen (Fig. 2) . While higher titers were observed in group 1 compared to group 2, this difference was not significant for either antigen. Five of 10 individuals in group 1 achieved a positive response titer of \u22651:40 to either the Anhui or Shanghai antigen at 2 weeks post-boost while 3 of 9 individuals in group 2 and 1 of 9 individuals in group 3 achieved a positive HAI response \u22651:40 (Table 1 ). In all groups, peak HAI GMT was detected 2 weeks post-boost (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). In group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), peak HAI GMT was maintained until 12 weeks post-boost, although the titer was lower than both groups 1 and 2 ( Fig. S1 ).",

            "text": "Influenza A/H7N9 is a public health threat for which a preventive vaccine may be needed to rapidly respond to a pandemic. In this phase 1 clinical trial, a novel H7 DNA vaccine was safe, welltolerated and provided robust immunogenicity as a priming vaccine when boosted with H7N9 MIV. Given the absence of baseline immunity to H7 in the human population and the weak immunogenicity of H7, it is anticipated that H7N9 vaccine regimens will require more than one injection. 14, 26, 27 Our results are consistent with this assertion. The DNA vaccine may provide an option for priming the immune system to improve the overall response to a heterologous booster vaccination, providing greater magnitude of antibody responses than with either vaccine alone. [27] [28] [29] [30] This may occur because DNA vaccines prime different populations of T cells than a protein-based vaccine, and may express a trimeric HA antigen in the membrane of the transduced cell that may have a more native structure than the HA in MIV. The duration and location of antigen presentation may also differ from MIV. These features may lead to a B-cell repertoire with different specificities and a broader expansion of antigen-specific B cells that could produce higher magnitude responses with higher avidity. 23 In this trial, compared to subjects who received only H7N9 MIV twice, subjects receiving H7 DNA as a priming vaccine developed higher HAI and neutralizing antibody titers 2 weeks following the H7N9 MIV boost. While this trial contained a limited number of subjects, these results are consistent with prior studies evaluating a similar regimen for H5N1, which showed that H5 DNA priming for an H5N1 MIV vaccine improved the antibody response when the boost interval was greater than 12 weeks. 22, 24 An HAI titer of \u22651:40 is the traditional benchmark used as a correlate for protection against seasonal influenza and as one criterion for licensing seasonal influenza vaccines. 12 However, it remains unclear what level of HAI titer is associated with protection against novel influenza strains including H7N9. Serologic evaluation of laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 in China suggest that robust antibody responses are associated with increased survival. In one cohort of 45 patients infected with H7N9, 64.9% of survivors had H7N9 HAI titers \u226580 while among fatal cases, only 28.6% had HAI titers \u226580 (ref. 31) . In contrast, an additional serological evaluation of 18 patients with confirmed H7N9 infection revealed that early and rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies, rather than HAI, correlated with improved clinical outcome. 32 In our study, 50% of those receiving the heterologous vaccine regimen of H7 DNA prime-H7N9 MIV boost achieved HAI titers \u22651:40 following the boost compared with only 1 of 9 receiving H7N9 MIV prime alone and boost. The HAI titers of the subjects were compared against both the Anhui and Shanghai strains. In subjects that received the H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV prime concurrently, there was a significant increase compared to the H7N9 MIV prime alone group for the Shanghui strain (14.7 vs. 5.8, p = 0.03) and marginal significance for the Anhui strain (21.6 vs. 8.3, p = 0.063). Nevertheless, the trends are very similar over the two strains. This difference in significance may have occurred due to the small number of subjects involved in the study.",

While the vaccine strategy described here still requires more than one dose, this study did not require adjuvants and included a DNA vaccine platform. The advantages of DNA vaccine platforms include: lack of anti-vector immunity, plasmid DNA stability, speed and ease of manufacturing and enhanced antibody and T-cell responses when administered via needle-free delivery system. 37, 38 Previous experience with DNA vaccines shows them to be safe, welltolerated and immunogenic as a priming vaccine, and they may be optimally suited for pre-pandemic scenarios where pre-existing immunity is lacking in the population. 22, 28, [38] [39] [40] In conclusion, the administration of H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV vaccines in prime-boost regimens was safe and well tolerated.",

Since the population is generally naive to H7, this provided the unique opportunity to evaluate immune responses to novel influenza vaccine platforms in the absence of baseline immunity. Further evaluation of the DNA prime-inactivated protein boost regimen on the diversity of the B cell repertoire, and the ability to elicit stem-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing heterologous influenza virus strains will provide additional insight into the complex immunological response to influenza vaccination.

The study was designed to assess the recombinant H7 DNA plasmid vaccine, VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP, administered alone or with the monovalent influenza subunit virion H7N9 Vaccine (MIV) as prime with H7N9 MIV boost compared to H7N9 MIV prime with H7N9 MIV boost. VRC 315 was designed to examine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccination regimens against H7N9 influenza, in healthy adults aged 18-60 years with no previous H7 avian influenza investigational vaccine administration. Subject inclusion criteria also included a body-mass index lower than 40, normal baseline blood counts, and normal liver and renal function laboratory measurements. The study was reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. Individuals provided written informed consent and completed a study specific assessment of understanding before enrollment. Human subjects protection guidelines for conducting clinical research from the US Department of Health and Human Services were followed. The primary end points evaluated the safety and tolerability of the three prime-boost regimens. The primary immunogenicity time point was 2 weeks after the H7N9 MIV boost. Sample size was determined to ensure good precision in estimating severe adverse event rate. Secondary and exploratory end points evaluated H7-specific antibody responses assessed by HAI assay and pseudovirus neutralization assays.",

The HA of Shanghai is extremely similar to Anhui, with only two nucleotide differences that result in a single amino-acid change. Monovalent bulk concentrate production, bulk formulation of the vaccine, and filling operations were all performed in the licensed facilities.
