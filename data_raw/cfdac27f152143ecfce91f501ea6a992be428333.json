A random of sample with 41 TCM systematic reviews was selected from a database. The interrater agreement of the individual items of AMSTAR was moderate with a mean kappa of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73). The ICC for AMSTAR against OQAQ (total score of 9 items, excluding item 10) was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93). Conclusions. Although there is room for improvement on few items, the new tool is reliable, valid, and easy to use for methodological quality assessment of systematic reviews on TCM.",

            "text": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the rarely existing traditional medicines that hold systematic theories as well as preventative and therapeutic methods for diseases in practice [1] . Since the 1950s, research methods in modern medicine (Western medicine) have been gradually introduced to TCM studies; the first TCM systematic review appeared in medical journals in the late 1990s, and now hundreds to thousands of reviews have been published on the area of TCM [2, 3] ; systematic reviews have become the standard approach in assessing and summarizing primary studies. However, even though systematic reviews proved to be useful, serious consideration must be given to how they were conducted; high methodological quality of systematic reviews is a prerequisite for recommendation of the use or avoidance of a TCM intervention. At present, either researches or methods for assessing quality of systematic reviews are still not fully developed in TCM and there is substantial room for improvement [2, 3] ; even in Western medicine current instruments for assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews are still suboptimal and need revision and updating [4, 5] . A new tool termed AMSTAR, an acronym for \"a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews,\" was developed strictly upon the OQAQ (Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire) [6] , the Sack checklist (quality assessment checklist) [7] , and three additional items. This tool is an 11-item questionnaire requiring assessors to answer \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"cannot answer,\" or \"not applicable\"; and a recent study reported that AMSTAR has good agreement, reliability, construct validity, and feasibility to assess the quality of systematic reviews [8] . However, these psychometric properties within AMSTAR were tested by having it apply to only a limited set of systematic reviews from Western medicine; a further step is needed to assess its validity and reliability, by a broader range of assessors and more samples of reviews in diverse circumstances [8] . Will the results be reproducible when assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews on traditional chinese medicine (TCM)? The answer is not clear yet, further validation is necessary. The aim of this study is to validate the reliability and external validity of AMSTAR by applying it to a sample of TCM systematic reviews.",

Then a search strategy for locating systematic reviews on TCM was formulated by using the definitions; search terms included \"Chinese medicine\", \"Chinese herb\", \"plant preparations\", \"Chinese medical formula,\" \"meta analysis,\" \"meta-analysis,\" \"meta-analyses,\" and \"systematic review.\" We performed a comprehensive search on CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database), VIP (Chongqing VIP periodicals Database), Medline and EMbase databases (January 1, 1999 to the end of 2008) in addition to hand search on Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine (incept to the end issue of 2008), Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (from the first issue in 1999 to the end issue in 2008), and Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine (from the first issue in 1999 to the end issue in 2008). Two reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of identified studies independently, disagreement was resolved by discussion. A total of 165 systematic reviews on TCM were included, full detail of evaluations has been reported separately [10] . We used a computer-generated random sample (approximately 25% of the 165 systematic reviews) as a test set for validation.",

On the basis of this, we constructed a data extraction form in Chinese for this study, in which 11 items of AMSATR and 10 items of OQAQ were adopted directly. In addition, publication status and reporting characteristics of systematic reviews, such as publish language, number of pages, funding source, update or not, Cochrane systematic review or not, target disease, and institution of first author, were also incorporated; besides, the time required to complete an assessment while applying AMSTAR and OQAQ was recorded too.",

Meanwhile, we also adopted the item 10 in OQAQ as a validated global assessment instrument. The overall mean scores (mean of two assessors), either using the self-developed 100point rating scale or using the item 10 from OQAQ, were also taken to verify the construct validity of AMSTAR.

Of which, only 9 reviews were written in English, and the majority (78%) was published in Chinese journals . The sample included 35 paper-based reviews and 6 Cochrane reviews; there was only one updated Cochrane review. According to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10), the topics of the reviews ranged across 9 systems, and mainly focused on diseases of circulatory system Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 (15 SRs or 37% of the sample, such as stroke and other cardiovascular diseases), infectious and parasitic diseases (7 SRs, like HBV, SARS), genitourinary system (5 SRs, such as ectopic pregnancy), digestive system (4 SRs, like ulcerative colitis), nervous system (3 SRs, such as Parkinson's disease), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (3 SRs, osteoporosis). The number of pages of included TCM SRs ranged widely from 2 to 80 with a median of 6 pages, of which, Cochrane systematic reviews had more pages than non-Cochrane reviews (P < 0.001), with medians of 31 (range: 16-80) and of 5 (range: 2-11), respectively. Less than half of the reviews (41.5%) were presented by clinicians.",

The analysis revealed that the construct validity was excellent, that is, the AMSTAR is a reliable and valid tool. Given the extremely strict implementation of Cochrane systematic review, such reviews conducted with high methodological quality have been widely recognized [52] ; the AMSTAR revealed Cochrane systematic reviews have higher quality scores than non-Cochrane systematic reviews, that is, the AMSTAR has an ability to discriminate methodological quality, so it is sensitive when applying it to a sample of systematic reviews in diverse quality.

The statistical analysis revealed that the AMSTAR was slightly more time consuming in contrast to OQAQ; there may be several explanations for this. First, the AMSTAR has 11 items, longer than the 10 items in OQAQ; second, the AMSTAR was developed based on two instruments, including OQAQ itself, so items in the instruments may be overlapped, and it would take less time to complete scoring when filling replicated items; third, the sequence of applying tools may be another explanation, as we conducted the assessment in the order of first AMSTAR and then OQAQ, assessors need more time to look through a systematic review to facilitate it in the first round of assessment by using AMSTAR, while in the second round by applying OQAQ, such time would be saved.",
