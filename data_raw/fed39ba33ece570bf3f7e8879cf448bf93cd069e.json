However, it remains unclear how disease epidemiology and the air-transportation network structure determine epidemic arrivals for different populations around the globe. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by developing and validating an analytical framework that requires only basic analytics from stochastic processes. We apply this framework retrospectively to the 2009 influenza pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic to show that key epidemic parameters could be robustly estimated in real-time from public data on local and global spread at very low computational cost. Our framework not only elucidates the dynamics underlying global spread of epidemics but also advances our capability in nowcasting and forecasting epidemics.",

            "text": "S ince the 1980s, metapopulation epidemic models built with worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) data have been the main tool for studying global spread of epidemics, such as pandemic influenza [1] [2] [3] [4] , SARS 5, 6 , MERS-CoV 7 , Ebola 8 , and Zika 9, 10 . The complexity of these models has substantially grown over the past few decades, advancing from 55 populations in the Rvachev-Longini model in 1985 1 to more than 3500 populations in the state-of-the-art simulator GLEAM powered by supercomputer 11, 12 . Despite the long history and widespread use of these models [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , most studies on global spread of epidemics have relied on computationally intensive simulations that provide limited epidemiologic insights, whereas an analytical understanding of the underlying epidemic dynamics has only been partially elucidated in recent years [18] [19] [20] . Here, we build on these recent advancements and develop a novel framework for analytically characterizing how epidemic arrivals for different populations around the world depend on the epidemiologic parameters and structure of the WAN. We first validate this framework using global epidemic simulations. We then illustrate its potential to enhance our ability to nowcast and forecast epidemics by applying it retrospectively to the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic and the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic in Liberia.",

Throughout this paper, we consider only global spread of epidemics with relatively fast timescales in which epidemics in each population peak within 300 days after establishment (e.g., pandemic influenza, MERS, Ebola) such that changes in demographics (e.g., births, aging) is negligible. In metapopulation epidemic models, populations (e.g., cities) around the world are connected through the travel of individuals via the WAN (see WAN metapopulation epidemic model in Methods for details). We designate population i as the epidemic origin which is seeded with s i infections at time 0. For any given population j, we denote its population size by N j and initial epidemic growth rate by \u03bb j . If populations j and k are directly connected in the WAN, the mobility rate from population j to k is defined as w jk = F jk /N j , where F jk is the direct airtraffic (passengers per day) and w jk ranges mostly between 10 -6 and 10 -3 per day in the WAN ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Let T n ij be the time at which population j receives its nth imported infection. The epidemic arrival time (EAT) for population j is defined as T 1 ij .

To this end, we progressively build up our framework by characterizing the probability distribution of EATs for all populations in three metapopulation networks with increasingly complex structure: (i) The two-population network which has the simplest metapopulation structure; (ii) the shortest-path-tree of the WAN (WAN-SPT hereafter) which is the dominant subnetwork driving global spread of epidemics as described by the seminal study by Brockmann and Helbing 20 ; and (iii) the WAN.",

This simulator is similar to GLEAM but without the effect of local commuting which has negligible impact on global spread 23 . Brockmann and Helbing 20 suggested that global spread of epidemics is primarily driven by the WAN-SPT subnetwork in which each population is connected to the epidemic origin via only one path. We will show that for each population k in the WAN-SPT, the time at which the nth importation occurs, namely T n ik , can be well characterized by f n (t|\u03bb,\u03b1) (Eq. 1), where \u03bb and \u03b1 are specifically parameterized to account for the hub-effect and continuous seeding (explained in the next two sections and Fig. 2a, b) . This provides a profound insight: the epidemic arrival process for each population k in the WAN-SPT can be approximated as an NPP with intensity function in the form of \u03b1 exp \u03bbt \u00f0 \u00de. Hub-effect: Hubs are populations that have direct connections to many populations in the WAN, e.g., Hong Kong, Beijing, New York. If the epidemic origin is a hub, the growth of local disease prevalence can be substantially reduced if a significant proportion of infections travel outward as the epidemic unfolds 18 . Let D i,c be the set of populations that are c degrees of separation from the epidemic origin in the WAN-SPT 24 . From the perspective of the importation process for a given population j \u2208 D i,1 (i.e., directly connected to the epidemic origin), the prevalence in population i grows exponentially at rate \u03bb ij = \u03bb i \u2212 \u2211 k \u2260 j w ik (see Fig. 2a and The WAN-SPT analysis in Methods for details). Figure 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3 show that with this hub-effect adjustment, f n (t|\u03bb ij ,\u03b1 ij ) accurately characterizes the probability distribution of T n ij for all populations in D i,1 (e.g., the percent error in expected EAT is uniformly below 4%). Continuous seeding: Unlike the epidemic origin which has a single seeding event at time 0, all the other populations in the WAN-SPT are continuously seeded by infections coming from their upstream populations. Suppose population k \u2208 D i,2 is connected to the epidemic origin via population j along the path \u03c8: i \u2192 j \u2192 k. After the epidemic has arrived at population j at time T 1 ij , population i continues to export infections to population j before the epidemic arrives at population k at time T 1 ik (illustrated in Fig. 2b ). Under assumption 2, each imported infection in population j (arriving at times T 1 ij , T 2 ij , \u2026) spawns an infection tree that grows exponentially at the hub-adjusted rate \u03bb jk . Therefore, the prevalence in population j, namely I j (t), is simply the sum of the prevalence for all these infection trees. As such, assumption 1 warrants that the exportation of infections from population j to k is an NPP with intensity function w jk I j (t), which is itself a stochastic process because of its dependence on the random variables T 1 ij , T 2 ij , \u2026 (see The WAN-SPT analysis in Methods). We conjecture that this highly complex stochastic process can be greatly simplified with little loss of accuracy by assuming that conditional on T 1 ij (the EAT for population j),",

By combining these global spread data with the World Health Organization patient database 33 on the weekly number of confirmed and probable cases in Montserrado and accounting for the effect of the opening of new Ebola treatment units in August 36,37 , we can use our framework to express the likelihood function in simple analytical form (see case study on the 2014 Liberian Ebola outbreak in Methods). We estimate that the reporting proportion (and hence the total number of cases) would have been statistically identifiable starting from 6 July 2014 onwards. We estimate that by 6 July 2014, the confirmed and probable cases only accounted for 18% (95% credible interval 7\u221233%) of all Ebola cases in Montserrado. The opening of new treatment units during August increased the reporting proportion to 30% (15\u221248%) by 17 August 2014, which is congruent with an independent estimate 38 based on capture-recapture sampling of raw patient records over a similar time horizon (34%; 95% confidence interval 26\u221250%). Retrospective real-time forecasts of the time to next exportation are consistent with the observed exportation times (namely 20 July and 19 September) except on 21\u221228 July during which the next exportation occurred later than predicted. The prediction errors on 21\u221228 July could be attributed to travel restrictions started in August 8 , the effect of which could not be included in the forecasts until they have actually occurred during August. If travel restrictions could have been foreseen on 21\u221228 July and incorporated into the forecasts (as a counterfactual scenario for illustration), the observed case exportation on 19 September 2014 would be consistent with the forecast range (Fig. 4b) . These conclusions are robust against temporal variations in epidemic growth rate (see case study on the 2014 Liberian Ebola outbreak in Methods).",

Approximation (i) is the indispensable centerpiece of our framework, whereas the necessity of approximations (ii)-(v) would depend on the specific application. Hubeffect adjustment is necessary when estimating the times of case exportation for populations that are directly connected to multiple populations and have relatively high outbound mobility rates. Continuous-seeding adjustment is necessary when estimating the times of case exportation for all populations except the epidemic origin (for which seeding is assumed to occur only at time 0). Path reduction and superposition are developed for simplifying computation as well as generating insights regarding global spread dynamics. In terms of computation, path reduction is required for populations that are three or more degrees of separation from the epidemic origin in a given acyclic path (which typically account for <20% of all populations), whereas path superposition is used for all populations (however, path superposition may not be necessary for populations that are directly connected to the epidemic origin with high mobility rates because the indirect paths have only minor impact on their EATs; see Supplementary Fig. 6 ). In terms of insights, the accuracy of path reduction implies that the epidemic arrival process from the epidemic origin to any given population along any given acyclic path \u03c8 can be accurately approximated as an NPP with intensity function \u03b1 \u03c8 exp \u03bb \u03c8 t \u00c0 \u00c1 , whereas the accuracy of path superposition implies that the dependence of multiple paths connecting a given population to the epidemic origin is relatively weak for the purpose of estimating EAT.",

If data are available for stratifying mobility rates and incidence by age, our framework should remain valid if the mobility rates w ij are calculated as the cross-product of agespecific mobility rates and age distribution of the disease. Second, we have assumed that each imported case spawns an exponentially growing infection tree with probability 1, whereas if we account for stochasticity in transmission dynamics, each imported case will fail to spawn an exponentially growing infection tree with probability p = 1/R 0 16 . Because this effect is similar to that of border control 19 , we conjecture that our framework can be extended to account for such stochasticity in transmission dynamics by discounting w ij with 1 \u2212 p. Third, we present our framework in the context of the classic SIR model. Nonetheless, our results can be generalized to all SE m I n R models 39 (see Generalizing to SE m I n R models in Methods). Fourth, we have not accounted for seasonality effects which may be strong and geographically heterogeneous for diseases such as seasonal influenza 40, 41 . Although the epidemic dynamics will certainly be less analytically tractable in the presence of seasonality (e.g., the pdf of the EAT can no longer be well approximated by simple closedform expressions as Eq. 1), we conjecture that the new analytics introduced here, namely adjustments for the hub-effect and continuous seeding as well as path reduction and superposition, will be useful for building a more general framework for global spread of epidemics. Finally, in our case studies, we have implicitly assumed that surveillance data were available in near realtime for nowcasting and forecasting, whereas in reality the availability of reliable data would likely incur longer lead times, and hence the timeliness of situational awareness implied here should be interpreted within such context.",

In this algorithm, we impose the constraint that the great circle distance between any pair of ACU and airport cannot exceed 200 km, according to the distribution of great circle distance for all combinations of ACUs and airports ( Supplementary Fig. 8b ). This reflects a reasonable upper bound on the distance of land transportation for reaching an airport 23 .

Next, consider the path \u03d5: i \u2192 j \u2192 k \u2192 m, i.e. m \u2208 D i,3 . Using path reduction, we can approximate \u03d5 with \u03d5': i \u2192 k \u2192 m where the adjusted mobility rate and epidemic growth rate in the origin for the i \u2192 k leg are \u03b1 \u03c8 and \u03bb \u03c8 , respectively.

Supplementary Table 2 shows the monthly outbound mobility rates from Montserrado during May-September 2014 in this OAG database. We denote the outbound mobility rate from population i during month k by W k (i.e., W k = \u2211 j w ijk , where w ijk is the daily mobility rate from population i to j during month k). Air travel restrictions were implemented starting in August 8 , which presumably resulted in a substantial proportion of canceled flight bookings (in particular for August 2014, see Supplementary Table 2 ). These abnormal cancellations were not registered in the OAG database. Therefore, as an approximation, we assume that the actual mobility rate in August 2014 was the same as that in September 2014.",

We use five MCMC chains and initialize each chain with a starting point randomly generated from the following ranges: ln\u00f02\u00de=\u03bb (i.e., the doubling time) between 1 and 100 days, i 0 between 1 and 100, \u03b8 before between 0 and 1, and \u03b8 after between 0 and 1. The trace plot and Geweke diagnostic indicate that each MCMC chain converges within 100,000 iterations and the autocorrelation of the samples in the MCMC chain drops below 0.05 when the lag is larger than 2000 steps. As such, we estimate the posterior distribution of (\u03bb, i 0 , \u03b8 before , \u03b8 after ) by running the Gibbs sampling for 5.5 million iterations with a burn-in of 0.5 million iterations and a thinning interval of 5000.

This suggests that the epidemic growth rate might have dropped since mid-August, which is plausible in view of substantial increase in mitigation efforts and resources starting in early August 36, 37 . As such, we perform a sensitivity analysis by assuming that the epidemic doubling time changed from D 1 to D 2 starting on 4 August 2014. Supplementary Figure 10 shows that our main result, namely the estimates of reporting proportion, remain essentially the same. For the scenario unadjusted for travel restrictions (Fig. 4b, bottom panel) , the retrospective real-time forecasts of the time to next international exportation are obtained by (i) assuming that mobility rates during the forecasted time period were the same as the most current mobility rates and (ii) sampling (\u03bb, i 0 , \u03b8 before , \u03b8 after ) from their posterior distributions.",

The basic reproductive number R 0 is inferred from the observed EATs for the 12 countries seeded by Mexico as formulated in Balcan et al.26 Blue circles and error bars indicate the R 0 estimates and their 95% confidence intervals in Balcan et al. assuming that the pandemic started in La Gloria on 11, 18, or 25 February 2009. b Case study of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Montserrado and Margibi, Liberia. The top panel shows the weekly number of confirmed and probable Ebola cases (bars) and the fitted epidemic curve based on parameters estimated from surveillance data up to 21 September 2014. The middle panel shows retrospective real-time estimates (i.e., nowcasting) of reporting proportion, where the x-axis indicates the date of inference. The bottom panel shows retrospective real-time forecasts of the time to the next international case exportation, with and without adjusting for air travel restrictions started in August 2014. Circles and bars indicate the medians and 99% range of forecasts, respectively. Blue horizontal lines indicate the international case exportations occurred on 20 July and 19 September, 2014.
