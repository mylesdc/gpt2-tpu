The main reason for admission to ICU is a pulmonary inflammatory syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (acute respiratory distress syndrome: ARDS), which can be fatal. Since the beginning of 2009 pandemic, international health authorities recommended monitoring severe and complicated cases of influenza infection [3, 4] . Considering the serious outcome of these respiratory diseases, the contribution of other respiratory pathogens besides A(H1N1)pdm09 should be envisaged [5] . Additionally, in clinical practice, a specific causative agent which explains the respiratory symptoms is often unidentified, owing to the lack of sensitive tests or the presence of an asyet unknown pathogen. The recently developed VIDISCA-454 (VIrus DIScovery using CDNA Amplified fragment-length polymorphism combined with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing) is a sensitive sequence-independent virus discovery technique which can be used to reveal as-yet unknown viruses [5, 6] .",

Data on comorbidities presence were available for nearly 70% of study patients: 64.3% reported medical conditions [3, 4] ; in detail, 25.6% had weakened immune system (due to cancer, HIV/AIDS, or long-term steroid treatment), 19.7% heart disease, 11.6% asthma/chronic lung disease, and 10.4% neurological/neurodevelopmental conditions. Out of 206 patients, 91 (59.3% males; 18.7% aged \u2264 5 years, 58.2% aged 6-64 years) were SARI cases who required admission to ICU and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, and 115 (62.6% males; 16.5% aged \u2264 5 years, 60% aged 6-64 years) were ARDS cases, as defined by the European Consensus Conference [8] . Nine ARDS patients (median age: 35.6 years, IQR: 21.4 years) died during hospitalization: case fatality rate (CFR) in our ARDS series was 7.8% (9/115). No SARI case was fatal.",

More than half (51.7%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection resulted in ARDS. It is interesting to note that most (67.5%) severe respiratory diseases due to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were identified among 6-64-year-old individuals. The A(H1N1)pdm09 case fatality rate in our ARDS series was 11.3% fatal cases in young adults, and 42.8% did not belong to any at-risk category [3, 4] . This data is in agreement with other studies; Van Kerkhove et al. have reported a median age of 46 years among fatal laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 cases [12] . McCallum has described that during the 2009 pandemic only 1% of laboratory-confirmed cases and 13% of laboratory-confirmed deaths were among persons 65 years of age or older [13] . The Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project has evaluated that although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons 65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost [14] . Such an age shift has been documented as well by several studies on A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality [15] [16] [17] .",
