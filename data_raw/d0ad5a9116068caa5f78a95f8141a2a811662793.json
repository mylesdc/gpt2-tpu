            "text": "A major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis. To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads). Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes. We propose NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), which allows for a fast, reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies, introducing minimal bias. This procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples, but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads.",

Viruses also lack universally conserved genomic regions and are both genetically and morphologically highly diverse 8 . Key-steps for studying viromes are the enrichment for virus-like-particles (VLPs) from a sample and the performance of random amplification, if the starting material needs to be increased before NGS library preparation 16 . These steps should preferentially avoid losses of any types of viruses and minimise bias introduced during sample preparation steps. However, this is challenging as viruses are highly diverse and might be removed during particular steps of VLP enrichment.",

Firstly, Sachsenr\u00f6der and colleagues spiked animal faecal samples with three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2). They were able to detect all three viruses using pyrosequencing after sample purification, although viral recovery rates were highly variable 17 . However, no bacterial or rRNA removal efficiency was tested and only one VLP purification condition was evaluated. Hall and colleagues tested a limited number of combinations of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease treatment, using low concentrations of three medium-small sized viruses (adenovirus, influenza A and human enterovirus), bacterial and human cells 18 , showing that different methods had a significant impact on virus recovery. Li and colleagues pooled samples (allantoic fluid, cell culture and faecal material) containing twenty five human viruses to compare different purification and amplification methods 19 . Their protocol was not able to recover all viruses and showed that recovery of viral reads was highly diverse when different sample preparation methods were used. Kohl and colleagues used four viruses (vaccinia virus, orthoreovirus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) to optimise a protocol to recover viruses from tissue. They used quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to detect relative losses of viruses after different purification and amplification procedures, again showing that the use of different methods has a strong effect on the final sequence outcome 20 . Recently, Kleiner and colleagues developed an artificial microbiome consisting of six bacteriophages (P22, T3, T7, \u03c6 6, M13 and \u03c6 VPE25) and two bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron). However, recovery of the dsRNA phage was not successful and recovery of viruses highly depended on the combination of methods used 21 . Finally, Rosseel and colleagues spiked Newcastle disease virus in serum and tissue and tested for filtration, DNase treatment and rRNA removal. This protocol was only tested for a single virus and can only be used for RNA viruses 22 .",

Our study individually evaluated the performance of each step of the procedure and systematically studied their effect on a unique mock-virome an artificial bacterial community, as well as on 16S rRNA to investigate bias introduced during each step and to obtain the most favourable virus-to-bacteria ratio. In conclusion, a detailed and reproducible protocol is proposed for viral metagenomics ( Fig. 1 and Protocol S1), although initial concentration steps might be required for samples with low initial viral load such as soil or ocean water samples. In addition, the modular approach of our study allows researchers to customise sample preparation depending on their needs or particular virus(es) of interest.",

            "text": "Homogenisation with ceramic beads reduces number of viral particles. To obtain reproducible results a proper homogenisation of biological samples (such as tissue or faecal samples) is crucial and minimises subsequent filter clogging 23 . As benchtop vortexers do not provide a standardised approach for sample homogenisation, a tissue homogeniser was used. The mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were subjected to homogenisation at different speeds (3000 and 5000 rpm) and with or without beads of different sizes (\u00d80.1 and \u00d82.8 mm) and compared to a non-homogenised control (Fig. 2) . Homogenisation with \u00d82.8 mm beads led to a destruction of viral particles irrespective of homogenisation speed. The reduction was largest for coronavirus (99.5% and 99.6% and Ct differences of 8.5 and 8.9 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively) and mimivirus (96.0% and 97.7% and Ct differences of 6.0 and 6.3 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively). In addition, \u00d82.8 mm beads led to a 316% and 350% increase in the detection of 16S rRNA at 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively (Ct difference 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). For the bacteria, \u00d82.8 mm beads also showed increases ranging from 612% (3.2Ct decrease) for the Bacteroides to 6184% for the E.coli (6.1Ct decrease). Homogenisation at 5000 rpm (without beads or with \u00d80.1 mm beads) showed a larger reduction in viral particles than homogenisation at 3000 rpm. Reduction of viral particles was lowest using 3000 rpm homogenisation without beads (the maximum percentage of reduction was 59.6% for the pepino mosaic virus, 1.07Ct), and did not increase the amount of bacterial DNA/rRNA. All conditions resulted in well-homogenised suspensions suitable for subsequent filtration experiments (data not shown). Centrifugation conditions strongly influence the reduction in bacterial and viral particles. Centrifugation is commonly used to precipitate larger particles, such as cells and cellular debris, while viruses remain in solution. Since this step differs greatly among studies [24] [25] [26] , we decided to test a mild and medium centrifugal force (100 g and 17000 g, respectively) as well as short (3 min) and medium (30 min) centrifugation times on our mock-communities (Fig. 3) . Higher g-forces or longer centrifugation times were not tested as this would result in even higher viral losses. Centrifugation at 100 g for 3 min showed limited differences compared to the control for viruses, bacteria and rRNA. Only for Lactobacillus a reduction of more than 1 Ct was observed (68.6%; 1.8Ct increase). Centrifugation for 30 min at 100 g, resulted in an increased reduction of mimivirus (94.6%; 4.5Ct). For the bacteria, the highest reductions were observed for the Lactobacillus (99.0%; 7Ct) and Bifidobacterium (96.0%; 5Ct), whereas E.coli and Bacteroides showed less pronounced reductions (80.6% or 2.4 Ct and 48% or 0.95 Ct, respectively). Centrifugation at 17000 g for both 3 and 30 min resulted in more than 99.99% reductions for Bifidobacterium, E.coli and Bacteroides. The reduction in Lactobacillus was slightly lower (99.7%-99.8%), whereas the reduction in the rRNA was 98.5-99.4%. For 3 minutes at 17000 g the losses for viruses were negligible, except for polyomavirus (43.3% loss, 1.2Ct), herpesvirus (65.3% loss, 1.3Ct), and especially mimivirus (96.9% loss, 5.4Ct). These findings were much more pronounced when centrifugation was performed at 17000 g for 30 minutes. Surprisingly, more than 90% reduction was observed for polyomavirus, coronavirus and herpesvirus, and 99.9% for mimivirus. Although the samples where thoroughly homogenised, it cannot be excluded that this observation is due to viral aggregates still present in the sample.",

Filtration is an efficient and widely used method to enrich viral particles by removing bacterial and host cells (human/animal/plant).

Filtration with the two 0.8-\u03bc m and 0.45-\u03bc m filters showed limited effects on most of the viruses in the mock-virome, except for mimivirus, the largest virus in the mock-virome, for which a 81.7% (3.8Ct increase), a 95.9% (6.8Ct) and a 99.0% (9.9Ct) reduction was observed for the 0.8-\u03bc m PES, the 0.8-\u03bc m PC and 0.45-\u03bc m filters, respectively.

Incubation in 1% chloroform resulted in a reduction less than 1 Ct for all the enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, except for mimivirus showing a moderate loss of 53.2% (1.3Ct increase) (Fig. 5A ). When incubating with higher percentages of chloroform (5-20%), no or very limited losses for circovirus, parvovirus, pepino mosaic virus and LIMEstone virus were observed. The highest reductions were observed for the enveloped coronavirus (range of reduction: 81.4-89.9%; 2.6-2.8Ct) and mimivirus (61.4-77%; 1.6-2.5Ct), and as well as for the non-enveloped rotavirus (range of reduction: 74-77%; 2.3-2.5Ct).

However, high concentrations of chloroform (10-20%) resulted in a substantial reduction of all bacterial species (99.6-99.999%; 8.8-17.6Ct).

To determine bias introduced by amplification, the number of cycles was varied with 5-step intervals between 7 and 22 and compared with a non-amplified control. At 7 amplification cycles an increase of at least 374% (3.7-fold) was observed for all viruses in the mock-virome.

The same procedure was followed for the bacterial mock-community and bacterial amplification after 7 cycles for Lactobacillus, E.coli and Bacteroides ranged between 1061-2033%, and increased 5611% for rRNA (Fig. 6 ). An increase between 7844% and 19088% was observed for 12 amplification cycles, whereas rRNA increased to 14920%.

Based on all results above, seven different work-flows were selected including homogenisation at 3000 rpm without beads and 17 amplification cycles, in combination with different conditions of filtration (0.8 PC/PES, 0.45 and 0.22-\u03bc m) and/or centrifugation (3 min at 17000 g). A combined artificial community of viruses and bacteria was subjected to the selected conditions and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 \u2122 . In the control sample sequencing data, 47.6%, 43.2% and 1.6% of the reads were attributed to bacteria, viruses and rRNA, respectively ( Fig. 7A and Table S4 ). The unmapped reads obtained were attributed to residual host and bacterial DNA derived from the preparation of viral stocks, such as Dickeya solani and Chlamydiales. The use of the 0.8-\u03bc m PC filter resulted only in minor reduction in the percentage of reads mapping to bacteria (47.3%). The remaining filtering and/or centrifugation conditions resulted in a dramatic reduction in the percentage reads that mapped to bacteria (ranging from 0.39% to 0.71%), while the number of viral reads increased to 88.8-96.7%. The 0.8-\u03bc m PES filter plus centrifugation condition yielded the highest percentage of viral reads, of which most were attributed to pepino mosaic virus (33.9%), LIMEstone virus (32.9%) and rotavirus (20.6%) (Fig. 7B) . When comparing the distribution of the viral reads of the control, the four protocols without centrifugation showed an expansion of the LIMEstone virus reads, mainly at the expense of rotavirus and pepino mosaic virus reads. Also, the combination of centrifugation with filtration showed a minimal increase of LIMEstone virus and pepino mosaic virus reads, but at the expense of parvovirus, polyomavirus and circovirus reads. The percentage of herpesvirus reads in the control was low (0.11%) and slightly increased with centrifugation plus 0.8-\u03bc m PES filter (0.18%). For the remaining conditions, herpesvirus reads ranged from 0.04% to 0.24%. The mimivirus viral reads in the control (0.91%) could only be increased when filtering with 0.8-\u03bc m PC filter (2.2%), but were strongly reduced when using the other protocols (0.011%-0.034%). Although nearly all bacteria were removed, the distribution of remaining bacterial sequence reads was dominated by Bacteroides in the control and 0.8-\u03bc m PC filter (41.3% and 43.5% of total reads, respectively), whereas in the remaining conditions E.coli was the most abundant (0.14-0.40%) (Fig. 7C and Table S4 ). The rRNA obtained reads were low for the control (1.59%) and reduced to 0.2%-0.004% for the treated conditions. Overall, a good correlation was observed between the number of viral copies as determined by qPCR and the percentage of mapped reads (R 2 = 0.91). For most viruses a high correlation between 0.88 and 0.97 was observed, only for circovirus and herpesvirus the correlation was slightly lower (R 2 = 0.75 and 0.63, respectively) (Fig. 7D ). For parvovirus no correlation was observed (R 2 = 0.16). No correlation for bacteria was calculated as the qPCR measurements for the bacteria after treatment were often below the detection limits of the used assays.",

No or limited homogenisation might be needed for cell culture supernatants, water or blood/serum samples. Faeces, respiratory or soil samples may benefit from a proper homogenisation, whereas tissue samples cannot proceed without a thorough homogenisation for virus release, often using beads of varying sizes. In this study we evaluated the effect of several homogenisation conditions on our artificial communities. Homogenisation with 2.8 mm beads resulted in severe loss of coronavirus and mimivirus, and particularly in a strong increase of bacteria and bacterial rRNA. Since the nucleic acids extraction kit used in this study was not optimised to extract bacterial DNA, extraction efficiency might be enhanced when homogenising with 2.8 mm beads by severely impairing bacterial cell walls. For any virome study this seems to be highly undesirable and should therefore be avoided. If unavoidable, viral losses have to be considered when interpreting the obtained results. The same effect was not observed when 0.1 mm beads were used, suggesting that a bigger mechanical force is necessary to increase extraction efficiency. Overall, the smallest effects on viral losses were observed using the lowest homogenisation speed without beads. In our experience, a proper homogenisation without beads is sufficient to destroy faecal aggregates and obtain a workable suspension.",

The increasing number of reports on giant viruses, which have similar physical dimensions as small bacteria makes this challenging [27] [28] [29] . Centrifugation is widely used in virome studies prior to filtration 13, 14, 26 , but effects on the virome have been quantitated poorly. Centrifugation for 3 min at 17000 g resulted in the removal of almost all bacteria, but unfortunately a significant reduction of mimivirus was also observed (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, centrifugation at 17000 g also resulted in a decrease around 99% in rRNA despite the fact that ribosomes have a size (20-30 nm) similar to those of many other viruses in our mock-virome (Table 1 ). However, the higher density of ribosomes (more than 1.6 g/cm 2 30 ) in comparison to viral particles may have led to their more efficient precipitation (Table 1) . Alternatively this observation may be partially explained by the fact that some of the ribosomes may still have been attached to larger bacterial cellular components. Filtration is probably the most used procedure to separate viral from bacterial/host cells during virome studies. The most popular filters for viral metagenomics studies contain 0.45-\u03bc m or 0.22-\u03bc m pore sizes 17 . Our results showed that the majority (> 99.5%) of bacteria in our mock-community were efficiently removed using filtration. Only the 0.8-\u03bc m PC filter had a relatively low filter efficiency (from 50% to 99.2%). Unfortunately, filters efficiently removing bacteria also removed more than 99% of mimivirus (Fig. 4A ). Not unexpectedly, more than 90% of the herpesviruses were lost with the 0.22-\u03bc m filter, alongside unexpected losses of several smaller viruses. Free floating ribosomes (20-30 nm) were not efficiently removed by filtration regardless of the pore size. Our findings suggest that besides the pore size, also the filter material highly influences filter efficiency. This was prominently observed between 0.8-\u03bc m PC and PES filters. Polycarbonate filters have pores precisely cylindrical and narrowly distributed across a thin polycarbonate sheet, whereas the centrifugal PES filter is a 3D polymer network, resulting in much higher filtering efficiency for bacteria and mimivirus (Fig. 4) . A limitation of our study is that no representatives of very small bacteria were included, however a great majority of small bacteria are obligate intracellular (e.g. Chlamydiales, Mycoplasmatales) and therefore removed together with their host during centrifugation and filtration.",

WTA2 utilises a similar approach and was modified to amplify both RNA and DNA. Although 17 amplification cycles are recommended by the manufacturer for transcriptome amplification, our findings indicate that all viruses could be amplified, independently of the number of cycles. However, the amplification efficiency differed between viruses, which could not be unambiguously explained by genome type (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA, dsRNA), length or composition (linear, circular, segmented). In previous reports it was shown that multiple displacement amplification preferentially amplified (single-stranded) circular genomes, which was not observed in this study using WTA2 32, 33 . Depending on the viral load in a sample, less than 17 amplification cycles can be sufficient, however, in our experience 17 amplification cycles produce reliable and reproducible results in various sample types with a wide range of virus concentrations. Nevertheless, in our protocol viral genome amplification introduced the most substantial bias, which was independent of the number of amplification cycles.",

The combination of centrifugation followed by filtration (0.8-\u03bc m PES) led to the highest number of viral reads (96.7%) and lowest percentage of bacterial and rRNA reads (0.19% and 0.003%; Fig. 7A ). In other viral metagenomics studies a combination of more stringent centrifugation conditions and filtration, typically carried out using 0.45-\u03bc m or 0.22-\u03bc m pore sizes, have been applied 15, [24] [25] [26] 34, 35 , which according to our results will lead to a dramatic reduction of larger viruses in a sample. Nevertheless, as with every viral enrichment protocol, including the one described in this study, the recovery of large viruses has to be balanced with the removal of bacterial/host genetic material, suggesting that bigger viruses (giant viruses, poxviruses, herpesviruses, etc.) might have been largely overlooked in past virome studies 28 . Rosseel and colleagues 22 showed that significant differences in sequence depth can be obtained when viral genomes are subjected to sequence independent amplification and Illumina sequencing, which could influence the relationship between qPCR results and read numbers. However, except for parvovirus, all viruses showed a high correlation between the number of viral genome copies measured by qPCR after amplification and the number of mapped NGS reads (R 2 = 0.91). The aberrant behaviour of the parvovirus remains unexplained, but is unlikely to be an experimental error as good correlations between qPCR assays and NGS reads were obtained for the remaining viruses. Overall, this suggests that no additional strong bias are introduced after amplification. To extend this further, high reproducibility was shown for our preferred viral enrichment procedure (Fig. S1) , which is crucial for comparison of viral abundancies from samples in large-scale studies.",

In addition, some viral families and genera are known to be unstable in CsCl, such as the Guttaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Nanovirus 31 . Furthermore a more recent study reported a strong loss of specific phages (\u03c6 VPE25 and T7) tested when using a CsCl method 21 . For samples with high volume and low viral load (e.g. ocean waters, urine), an additional concentration step may be required. Approaches using FeCl 3 or PEG precipitation have been shown very useful [36] [37] [38] . The quantitative effect of these procedures on each member of the viral community has not been studied. However, the use of a pre-filtration step with 0.2-\u03bc m, as often used for these methods, will lead to the removal of larger viruses (Fig. 4) , which could be overcome by using a 0.8-\u03bc m filter instead.",

Lactobacillus acidophilus (Firmicutes) and Bifidobacterium animalis are Gram-positive (Actinobacteria), whereas Escherichia coli (Proteobacteria) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bacteroidetes) are Gram-negative. For each member in our mock-community, a qPCR assay targeting a unique and specific region was developed or retrieved from literature 43 . In addition, to quantify the number of 16S rRNA copies of the Bacteroides genus an additional qPCR assay was used (Table S3 ). The number of 16S copies for the other bacterial species was not determined because the structure of ribosomes is highly conserved among bacterial species, and were therefore not expected to behave differently in our experiments. All bacterial strains were acquired from the Belgian Co-ordinated Collection of Micro-organisms (BCCM) in their growing medium with the following LGM accession numbers: 13550 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), 2092 (Escherichia coli), 18906 (Bifidobacterium animalis) and 11262 (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron). The bacterial mock-community was assembled from its original growing stocks and no buffers/medium were added and aliquots were made and preserved at \u2212 80 \u00b0C to ensure one freeze-thaw cycle.
