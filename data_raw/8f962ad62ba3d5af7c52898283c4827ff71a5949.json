Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses are activated by TMPRSS2. However, previous studies on viral activation by TMPRSS2 focused on a 492 amino acids comprising form of the protein (isoform 2) while other TMPRSS2 isoforms, generated upon alternative splicing of the tmprss2 mRNA, have not been characterized. Here, we show that the mRNA encoding a TMPRSS2 isoform with an extended N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (isoform 1) is expressed in lung-derived cell lines and tissues. Moreover, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 isoform 1 colocalizes with HA and cleaves and activates HA. Finally, we show that isoform 1 activates the SARS-CoV spike protein for cathepsin L-independent entry into target cells. Our results indicate that TMPRSS2 isoform 1 is expressed in viral target cells and might contribute to viral activation in the host.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses pose a significant threat to human health. In particular, annual influenza epidemics are associated with several hundred thousand deaths every year, and interspersed pandemics may wreck even greater havoc [1] , as documented by the 1918 Spanish influenza, which caused 30 to 50 million deaths [2] . Antiviral drugs against influenza are available but their effectiveness is compromised by frequent acquisition of viral resistance. Moreover, no drugs with broad antiviral activity are available to combat emerging and highly virulent respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. In order to close this gap, novel antiviral strategies are being sought, which allow inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses and which are associated with a high barrier against resistance development. Host cell factors which are essential for viral spread but dispensable for cellular survival are attractive targets for such approaches to antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "The surface proteins of influenza A viruses (FLUAV) and coronaviruses, termed hemagglutinin (HA) and spike (S), respectively, facilitate viral binding to host cells and fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane [3] . These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and are converted by host cell proteases into their active forms [4] , a process referred to as activation in the remainder of the manuscript. Activation is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral therapy. Recent work indicated that several respiratory viruses hijack the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 for their activation. Thus, TMPRSS2 was shown to cleave and activate the HA proteins of diverse FLUAV in culture [5] [6] [7] [8] and studies with tmprss2-deficient mice indicated that TMPRSS2 expression is essential for spread and pathogenesis of FLUAV [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, augmented TMPRSS2 expression was found to be associated with increased risk of severe influenza upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus and with increased susceptibility to H7N9 FLUAV infection [12] . Finally, TMPRSS2 was shown to activate diverse CoVs [13] [14] [15] [16] , parainfluenza virus [17] , human metapneumovirus [18] and hepatitis C virus [19] in cell culture and might contribute to viral spread in the host. Remarkably, the absence of TMPRSS2 does not compromise development or homeostasis [20] , indicating that TMPRSS2-specific inhibitors might exert broad antiviral activity without causing substantial unwanted side effects.",

It has been suggested that the tmprss2 transcript can be alternatively spliced [23, 24] , which may result in the production of two isoforms which differ only in the N-terminal, cytoplasmic tail: Isoform 1 contains 37 amino acids in its tail which are not present in isoform 2.

All cell lines were obtained from collaborators and were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination. The FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Panama/ 2007/99 (H3N2) were propagated in the chorioallantoic cavities of 10-days-old embryonated hen eggs (Valo BioMedia, Germany) for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter, the eggs were euthanized by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C and the allantoic fluid was harvested. Before propagation in eggs, the FLUAV A/Panama/2007/99 was recovered from a reverse genetics system [26] . The amount of infectious units within the chorioallantoic fluid was determined by focus formation assay, as described previously [25] . In brief, serial 10-fold dilutions of samples were prepared and added onto MDCK cells. After 1 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by infection medium containing Avicel overlay and 2.5 \u03bcg/ml N-acetylated trypsin (Sigma). After an incubation period of 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-FLUAV polyclonal antibody from goat (Millipore). Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with anti-goat-HRP antibodies (KPL), washed again and incubated for 10 min with True Blue substrate (KPL). Finally, foci were counted and viral titers were calculated as focus forming units (FFU) per ml of culture supernatant.",

Isoform 2 has been shown to activate the envelope proteins of several viruses while it is at present unknown whether isoform 1 can also act as a viral activator. Moreover, it is unknown whether the isoforms are differentially expressed in viral target cells. To address these questions, we cloned the transcript variants encoding for each individual isoform and analyzed whether the proteins are efficiently expressed in transfected cells. The expression levels of TMPRSS2 isoforms 1 and 2 were comparable as determined by Western blot (Fig 1B) and flow cytometry ( Fig 1C) and unprocessed isoform 1 exhibited a slightly higher molecular weight than its counterpart (Fig 1B) , in keeping with expectations (expected molecular weight isoform 1, 57.7 kDa; expected molecular weight isoform 2, 53.9 kDa). Both proteins were autocatalytically activated (i.e. the inactive zymogen form was cleaved between the C-terminal protease domain and the remainder of the protein, which allows the protease domain to undergo conformational changes and to transit into an active state), as evidenced by the presence of N-terminal cleavage products. A single N-terminal fragment was observed for isoform 2 while two fragments were detected for isoform 1 (Fig 1B) , suggesting that the presence of an extended N-terminus in isoform 1 does not alter the efficiency of TMPRSS2 autoactivation but might change cleavage specificity.",

Cleavage of the HA precursor, HA 0 , was observed upon treatment of cells with trypsin and upon coexpression of DESC1 and TMPRSS2 isoform 2, in keeping with previous reports [5, 25] (Fig 4A) . Additionally, HA proteolysis was detected upon coexpression of TMPRSS2 isoform 1. In contrast, the proteolytic cleavage products were not observed upon treatment of cells with PBS or upon coexpression of TMPRSS3 (Fig 4A) , as expected [25] .",

To this end, we determined the spread of FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and FLUAV A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) in 293T cells transfected to express the indicated proteases. Treatment of cells with PBS or expression of TMPRSS3 did not promote viral spread (Fig 4B) , as expected [5, 25] . In contrast, expression of TMPRSS2 isoform 2 and DESC1 or treatment of the cells with trypsin boosted viral spread ( Fig  4B) , again in keeping with published findings [5, 25] . Finally, expression of TMPRSS2 isoform 1 markedly increased viral spread to levels observed in the presence of isoform 2, and spread was markedly reduced by camostat mesylate (not shown), a serine protease inhibitor known to be active against TMPRSS2. In sum, these results indicate that isoform 1 and isoform 2 can efficiently cleave and activate FLUAV HA.",

Activation of SARS-S and MERS-S by TMPRSS2 isoform 2 occurs during viral entry into target cells and renders this process independent from the activity of cathepsin L [14] [15] [16] 29, 30] , an endosomal cysteine protease which can activate SARS-S and MERS-S for entry into TMPRSS2-negative cells [29] [30] [31] . We investigated whether TMPRSS2 isoform 1 can also activate SARS-S and MERS-S. Western blot analysis of protease and SARS-S or MERS-S transfected cells revealed that both TMPRSS2 isoforms processed the S proteins comparably (Fig 5A  and data not shown) . Moreover, SARS-S-and MERS-S-driven entry into control cells was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of cells with MDL28170, a cathepsin B and L inhibitor, and this effect was rescued by TMPRSS2 isoform 2 and DESC1 but not TMPRSS3 (Fig 5B and  5C ), in keeping with published data [14] [15] [16] 25, 29, 30] . Similarly, rescue was observed upon expression of isoform 1 (Fig 5B and 5C) , indicating that the extended N-terminus is compatible with coronavirus S protein activation during entry.",

            "text": "The tmprss2 gene is located on chromosome 21 and comprises 14 exons and 13 introns [23, 24] . It has been suggested that tmprss2 mRNA may be alternatively spliced [23, 24] and two transcript variants were documented at NCBI, which only differ in the first exon. The encoded proteins are identical except for the presence of an extended cytoplasmic domain in isoform 1 and the impact of this extension on expression and function was unknown. The present study shows that isoform 1 is efficiently expressed in transfected cells and, in keeping with expectations, exhibits a slightly increased molecular weight relative to isoform 2. Thus, the enzymatically inactive zymogen form of isoform 1 migrated slower than its counterpart in isoform 2 (the two bands observed might be the result of differential glycosylation) and differences were also observed for the N-terminal fragment of the protease, which is generated upon autocatalytic activation. Notably, two prominent N-terminal fragments were consistently observed for isoform 1 but not for isoform 2. Thus, the extended cytoplasmic domain might give rise to the expression of different glycoforms or, maybe more likely, might alter the specificity of autocatalytic cleavage, which is essential for the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2. In fact, an impact of the cytoplasmic domain on the autocatalytic activation has previously been reported for the TTSP corin, in which the presence of a shortened cytoplasmic tail, due to the use of an alternative exon 1, reduces plasma membrane localization and autocatalytic activation [21] .",

In general, the expression patterns of transcript variant 1 and 2 were similar but not identical, suggesting that in certain tissues only isoform 1 might be available for viral activation. Whether the mRNA expression data match the expression of protein remains to be determined and such studies are complicated by the absence of isoform-specific antibodies. No major differences in the cellular localization of the two isoforms were observed, although distribution of isoform 2 at or close to the cell surface was more homogenous than that of isoform 1, which was frequently detected within speckles. Thus, the extended cytoplasmic tail of isoform 1 slightly impacts protein localization in transfected cells and this impact might be more pronounced in cells endogenously expressing this isoform.",

Our study provides an affirmative answer: Both isoform 1 and 2 colocalized with HA in transfected cells, cleaved HA upon coexpression and activated authentic FLUAV of different subtypes. Moreover, isoform 1, like isoform 2, activated SARS-S and MERS-S for entry into target cells. Thus, the presence of an extended N-terminus does not seem to alter the ability of TMPRSS2 to activate respiratory viruses, although one should take into account that transfected cells might not mirror all aspects of cells endogenously expressing isoform 1.",

(A) Expression plasmids encoding FLUAV HA subtypes H1 (left) and H3 (right) and the indicated proteases or empty plasmid (pCAGGS) were transiently cotransfected into 293T cells. At 48 h post transfection the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin, and HA cleavage was determined by Western blotting. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. The HA 0 precursor (upper arrow) and the HA 1 (middle arrow) and HA 2 (lower arrow) subunits are indicated. (B) The indicated proteases were transiently expressed in 293T cells and the cells infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at an MOI 0.01 (left) or FLUAV A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) at an MOI of 0.1 (right) and treated with either trypsin or PBS. At 48 h post infection, the virus release was measured by determination of infectious particles (ffu/ml) in the culture supernatant. The results of representative experiments performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. ffu, focus forming units. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.TMPRSS2 isoform 1 cleaves and activates the SARS-coronavirus spike protein. (A) 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid encoding SARS-S with a C-terminal V5 tag and plasmids encoding the indicated proteases. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin, and SARS-S cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting with a V5-specific antibody. The expression of \u03b2-actin served as a loading control. The results are representative of three independent experiments with different plasmid preparations. Black-filled arrowhead, uncleaved SARS-S; gray-filled arrowhead, S2 subunit generated by trypsin digest; white-filled arrowheads, C-terminal cleavage fragments generated by TMPRSS2. (B) To analyze SARS-S-driven viruscell fusion, 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases and ACE2. At 24 h post transfection, the cells were pretreated with medium supplemented with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL 28170, and transduced with pseudotypes bearing SARS-S. The luciferase activities in cell lysates were analyzed at 72 h post transduction. The results of a representative experiments performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. (C) MERS-S-driven virus-cell fusion was analyzed as described for panel B but 293T cells transfected to express DPP4 were used as targets. The results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. c.p.s., counts per second. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0138380.g005",
