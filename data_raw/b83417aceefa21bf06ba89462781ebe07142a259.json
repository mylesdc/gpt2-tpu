The prevalence of CDV is a major concern in susceptible animals. Presently, it is unclear whether intragenic recombination can contribute to gene mutations and segment reassortment in the virus. In this study, 25 full-length CDV genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. The results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (H, F, P, N, L, M) of the CDV genome. The analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the CDV genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. The six recombination events were detected using SimPlot and RDP programs. The analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the CDV individual gene were under negative selection. Collectively, these data suggested that homologous recombination acts as a key force driving the genetic diversity and evolution of canine distemper virus.",

            "text": "Canine distemper (CD) is caused by the canine distemper virus (CDV) that belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family. The length of the CDV genome is 15,690 nucleotides (nt), and it possesses a single-stranded negative RNA encoding six nonoverlapping transcriptional units producing eight proteins [1, 2] . The genomic RNA that is tightly encapsulated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein serves as a template for transcription and replication by the viral polymerase (L) protein and its cofactor phosphoprotein (P). The N, P, and L proteins together with the viral RNA constitute the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [3] , which directs the sequential synthesis of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from six transcriptional units or the replication of full-length encapsulated antigenomes [4] . The viral envelope contains two integral membrane proteins, fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (H), as well as, a membrane-associated protein [matrix (M)] that altogether establish the contact with the RNP [5] . The H glycoprotein facilitates the binding of the virus to PLOS the cell membrane; the F protein accomplishes the fusion of the two membranes, which enables the entry of the viral RNP into the cytoplasm [6] . Canine distemper is a highly contagious and lethal disease that affects several many carnivorous species. This virus infects a wide variety of animal families, such as Mustelidae (ferrets, minks, skunks, weasels, and badgers), Procy onidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears and pandas), Viver ridae (civets, genets, and linsangs), Hyaenidae (hyenas), and Felidae (lions and tigers). The genome of CDV encodes the genes for the following components: matrix (M = 1008 bp), fusion (F = 1989 bp), hemagglutinin (H = 1824 bp), nucleocapsid (N = 1572 bp), polymerase (L = 6555 bp), and phosphoprotein (P = 1524 bp).",

The breakpoints were also confirmed by the RDP4 program [13] . Each of the recombination isolate encompassed two strains, which were suggested as the representatives of its putative parental lineages (Fig 2) . To further validate the authenticity of the recombination events, SimPlot was employed that exhibited a result similar to that of the RDP4 program except for the breakpoint. The crossover sites depend on the size of the sliding window in SimPlot, and hence, the recombination breakpoints in RDP4 and SimPlot are different. The gold-standard bioinformatic approach for demonstrating the presence of recombination is a set of statistically incongruent phylogenetic trees [19] ; thus, phylogenetic trees were also constructed using MEGA 5.0 to further determine the recombination events. Eventually, six groups of potential recombination events have been determined (Table 2) .",

The analyses using RDP and SimPlot programs showed that the first potential recombinant event occurred in the strain (JX681125/HLJ1-06). The two strains (KC427278/Hebei and HM046486/ Phoca/Caspian/2007) isolated from China and Kazakhstan might be the major and minor putative parents, respectively, and the breakpoint regions of the potential recombinant strain, JX6811 25/HLJ1-06, were localized from 12771-14312 (in SimPlot) and 12922-14259 (in RDP4) bp. To further analyze the identified recombination event, the strain JX681125/HLJ1-06 was utilized as the query in the SimPlot program ( Fig 3A) . One potential breakpoint was localized at the parsimonious region, 12771-14312 bp, as identified by the maximization of X 2 . The sequence of HLJ1-06 showed greater affinity with one putative parent lineage of Hebei position 1-12770 and 14313-15690 bp than the other putative parent Phoca/Caspian/2007. However, the sequence of Phoca/Caspian/2007from 12771-14312 bp shared a greater similarity with HLJ1-06 than Hebei. An identical evidence was displayed by the Boot Scan result ( Fig 3B) . Owing to the difference in the breakpoint regions in SimPlot and RDP, we selected the total partial 12922-14259 bp region for analysis. The recombination events were further substantiated by constructing the phylogenetic tree using MEGA 5.0. In the putative non-recombinant regions (positions 1-12921 + 14260-15690), HLJ1-06 and Hebei were clustered into the same sub-lineage ( Fig 3C) , while Phoca/Caspian/2007 was grouped into a distinct sub-lineage. However, in the putative recombinant regions, 12922-14259 bp, the arrangement of the phylogenetic tree reflecting the relationship of the three isolates contradicted the previous tree ( Fig 3D) . The topology of the two phylogenetic trees around the breakpoint showed a significant statistical discrepancy when the PDV was included in the analyzed data (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, p < 0.001) constituting a robust evidence for recombination.",

According to the phylogenetic analysis, all the CDV isolates detected in naturally occurring cases clustered according to the geographical distribution. Comparing the phylogenetic trees between CDV genome sequences and six individual gene sequences, the topology of the phylogenetic trees in every individual gene were found to have a high identity with the phylogenetic tree of the genome sequence.

Recombination, especially between different serotypes, may accelerate the evolution of the virus effectuating a rapid change in its epidemiology [39] . In this study, nine groups of potential recombination events were detected by RDP4 and SimPlot programs, and the six potential recombination events included six recombination strains (JX681125/HLJ1-06, AY445077/ 98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, AY466011/98-2654, AB462810/007Lm-1vp, and AB474397/ 007Lm). According to the phylogenetic analysis, the JX681125/HLJ1-06 strain belongs to the group of Asia-1. The other three strains, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654, belonged to the group of America-1. The remaining two strains, AB462810/007Lm-1vp and AB474397/007Lm, belonged to the group of Asia-2. Similar to that reported previously [40] , we confirmed that JX681125/HLJ1-06, AB462810/007Lm-1vp, and AB474397/007Lm were wild-type strains. On the contrary, the other three strains, AY445077/ 98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654 were vaccine strains but not artificial [41] . Moreover, it could be speculated that the strains of the same group may have a high homology, thereby leading to similar recombination events. Thus, the six sequences were aligned using ClustalW and compared by DNAStar. Consequently, we found that the three strains, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654, showed a high sequence similarity (> 99%) with each other (date not shown), as well as, the other two strains (AB462810/007Lm-1vp and AB474397/007Lm).

These results suggested that all the phylogenetic trees supported the recombination result obtained from RDP4 and SimPlot analyses.

During the replication of their genomes, the nucleotide substitutions occur at high frequencies presumably to allow rapid adaptations to various selection pressures [43] . In the current study, considering that the six individual genes were vital to CDV, we assessed the nucleotide selection pressure in the six individual genes (H, F, P, N, M, L). No previous studies suggested whether these six individual genes were under negative or positive selection. In this study, the mean ratio of dN and dS rates (dN/dS) for the six individual genes were both < 1, and the rate for the six individual genes was M (0.074) < L (0.082) < N (0.095) < H (0.263) < F (0.310) < P (0.352) (S2 Table) . These result indicated that the six individual genes were under purifying selection; P was under stronger negative selection than other genes, while M exhibited a highly conserved property. This finding strongly correlated with the higher evolutionary rate of P compared to other genes and postulated the correlation of the selection pressure and the rate of evolution [44, 45] . We also found nine positive selection sites (H-178, N-456, M-312, L-2137, F-79/110, and P-148/256/278), especially, positive natural selection involved in immune escape could cause similar sequences to evolve in unrelated strains.",
