IFITM1-3 are unique amongst the currently described viral restriction factors in their apparent ability to block viral entry. This restrictive property is dependant on the localisation of the proteins to plasma and endosomal membranes, which constitute the main portals of viral entry into cells. The topology of the IFITM proteins within cell membranes is an unresolved aspect of their biology. Here we present data from immunofluorescence microscopy, protease cleavage, biotin-labelling and immuno-electron microscopy assays, showing that human IFITM1 has a membrane topology in which the N-terminal domain resides in the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal domain is extracellular. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this topology is conserved for all of the human interferoninduced IFITM proteins. This model is consistent with that recently proposed for murine IFITM3, but differs from that proposed for murine IFITM1.",

Initially identified over 30 years ago [2] , and named 9-27 (IFITM1), 1-8D (IFITM2) and 1-8U (IFITM3) [3] , these proteins received little attention until human IFITM3 depletion was found to enhance IAV infection in cell culture assays. Conversely, overexpression of IFITM3, or the closely related IFITM1 and IFITM2, could inhibit IAV replication [1] . Studies in mice and humans have suggested that IFITM3, at least, also protects against IAV infection in vivo [4, 5] . However, the IFITM proteins are not IAV-specific and, in cell culture at least, have broad-spectrum antiviral activity [6] , though in some systems they may enhance cellular infection of human coronavirus OC43 [7] and human papillomavirus 16 [8] .",

Furthermore, this activity was dependent on localisation of IFITM3 to endosomes [10] . More recent studies suggested that IFITM over-expression may increase membrane rigidity and positive curvature, preventing the early events in membrane fusion [11] . Alternatively, IFITM protein interaction with vesicle membrane protein associated protein A (VAPA), disrupts cholesterol homeostasis and may increase membrane rigidity [12] . However, more recent work has questioned the role of cholesterol [13, 14] . Thus, the precise molecular mechanism(s) for IFITM inhibition of viral entry remains to be established.",

Additional studies demonstrated palmitoylation of cysteine residues adjacent to the hydrophobic domains, a post-translational modification indicative of membrane proteins [16] . However, the membrane topology of the IFITM proteins has remained ambiguous. Initially, they were suggested to be dual pass, transmembrane proteins with both N-and Cterminal domains (NTD and CTD) exposed extracellularly and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) (Fig. 1, model 1) . This model was based on the ability of antibodies against unknown IFITM1 external epitopes to aggregate leukaemia cells [15, 17] , immunoprecipitation of extracellular radiolabelled IFITM1 [18] and the accessibility of IFITM3 NTD and CTD epitope tags at the cell surface by FACS and immunofluorescence assays, respectively [1] .",

To calculate the relative areas of yellow, red and green signals, images were initially split into the red and green component channels. These two images were then processed with the 'AND' function in ImageJ (producing an image of pixels that are only both red AND green). This image was subject to a manual threshold to observe only cellular structures and remove background noise. The pixel area was then calculated and these pixels defined as ''yellow.'' The ''yellow'' pixels were then superimposed on the red and green single channel images, and removed from each of these (such that a pixel defined as ''yellow'' cannot be considered ''red or ''green''). The same approach of applying a threshold was then taken on the red channel to calculate the pixel area, with these being defined as ''red.'' Again, once calculated, these ''red'' pixels were super-imposed on the green channel image and removed. This allowed a threshold to be applied to the green channel and the area of the remaining pixels calculated. The relative area for each colour was calculated for each field of view and the mean average of all values calculated.",

This domain has 69% and 75% amino acid identity with hu IFITM2 and IFITM3, respectively. The IFITM3 NTD antibody (anti-IFITM3-NTD) was raised against a peptide with a sequence corresponding to the first 30 amino acids of hu IFITM3. Hu IFITM1 has an Nterminal 21 amino acid truncation compared to IFITM3, so contains only 9 amino acids overlapping with this domain. However, there is 90% amino acid identity between the first 30 amino acids of hu IFITM3 and IFITM2.",

To further investigate this topology, we used protease cleavage assays. Since IFITM1-HA is primarily localised to the plasma membrane we hypothesised that the CTD, and HA-tag, might be accessible to digestion by extracellular proteases. Following analysis of the human IFITM1 CTD sequence with the ExPASy 'PeptideCutter' tool (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/) we chose to use trypsin, which was predicted to cleave at two positions close to the C-terminus of hu IFITM1 and thus expected to release the HA-tag (Fig. 5A) .",

Analysis of samples from untreated cells with anti-IFITM1-NTD indicated two IFITM1 bands (Fig. 5Bi) , as previously seen (Fig. 3A) . In samples from trypsin-treated cells the higher molecular weight band was rapidly lost, with a concomitant increase in the intensity of the lower band (Fig. 5Bi ). This suggested that the higher molecular weight band is IFITM1-HA (confirmed in an anti-HA and anti-IFITM1-NTD overlay analysis [ Fig. 5Biii]) , and that the lower band is a cleavage product that has lost the HA-tag. We noted that about 8% (relative to untreated samples) of the HA-tagged protein was not digested by trypsin, even after long periods, suggesting that a small pool of IFITM1-HA protein was inaccessible to the protease (see below).",

Gel i shows samples from cells labelled with biotin, gel ii shows unlabelled samples and gel iii shows samples from mock transfected HEK293T cells that were treated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. NB. The elution step detached some NeutrAvidin monomers from the beads. These run at approximately 14 KDa and are seen as background bands in the western blots (labelled 'NeutrAvidin'). Calreticulin was used as a loading control and negative control for pulldown specificity.

As previously, NeutrAvidin monomers were eluted, and have the same molecular weight at IFITM1-Vstop.

The NTD contains two potential trypsin cleavage sites, but we saw no evidence of these sites being accessible to exogenous trypsin. Thus our results are consistent with a model recently proposed for murine and human IFITM3 indicating a cytoplasmic NTD and CIL domain, connected by an intramembrane hydrophobic domain (M1) that does not fully span the membrane, and a second transmembrane domain (M2) linking the CIL domain to an extracellular CTD [21, 22] . Our results with antibody labelling experiments indicate that hu IFITM2 and 3 are likely to have the same topology, suggesting this may be a common feature of human interferoninduced IFITM proteins, and mu IFITM3. However, this model is not consistent with published data on mu IFITM1 [20] , in which palmitoylation of a CTD cysteine (mu IFITM1 C103) suggested a cytoplasmic location. This cysteine is not conserved in hu IFITM1, perhaps indicating why there is an apparent difference between hu and mu IFITM1 [20] .

Indeed, our results suggest that, even under normal culture conditions, IFITM-HA expressing cells have cleavage products resulting from the loss of the HA-tag or residues from the CTD itself. Western blots of A549 cells stably expressing IFITM1 show two bands when using the anti-IFITM1-NTD antibody. The higher molecular weight band is the HA-tagged form of the protein, while the lower weight band is a cleaved form of the protein that has lost the HA-tag, and possibly other residues from the CTD. Since this band is seen in cells that were not treated with trypsin, we suggest that this Cterminal cleavage may occur in the endosomal system. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in A549 cells expressing HA-tagged IFITM2 or 3, intracellular organelles can be seen that contain IFITM2 or 3 with intact NTD epitopes but lacking the CTD HA-tag (Fig. 9) .",

Reliance on CTD epitope tags to determine the cellular distribution of the protein may not reveal the full cellular content of protein, and functionally important pools may be overlooked.",

Whether all vertebrate IFITM proteins conform to the same organisation and, if not, the functional implications of other topologies, remain to be established. Figure S1 Tubulin co-staining on intact and permeabilised IFITM cell lines. C-terminal domain HA-tagged IFITM1-3 and A549 cell lines were co-stained intact, or following permeabilisation, with an anti-HA antibody and an anti-tubulin antibody. These antibodies were detected with Alexa-488 (green) and Alexa-594 (red), respectively. A) Permeabilised IFITM-HA cells show positive labelling for all IFITM proteins and tubulin. B) Intact IFITM-HA cells show no labelling for tubulin, indicating that the plasma membrane has remained intact and the antibody does not have access to the cytoplasm. As previously, IFITM1-HA can be labelled on intact cells, IFITM2-HA has no labelling and only a minority of IFITM3-HA expressing cells shows plasma membrane labelling. Nuclei were labelled with Hoechst. All images are maximum projections of 0.25 mm optical sections taken through the depth of the cells on a confocal microscope. All images were taken using the same microscope settings and the levels adjusted uniformly. Scale bars represent 15 mm.

In Model 3, the NTD and CIL domain are intracellular, suggesting M1 does not span the membrane, but the CTD is located on the extracellular side of the membrane and requires that M2 spans the membrane. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104341.g001",
