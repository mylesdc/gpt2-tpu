However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in na\u00efve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID 50 /ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560-0.056 TCID 50 /ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2-37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560-5.6 TCID 50 /ml (Ct 24.2-31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56-0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct values 35.3 ->45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.",

PEDV was identified in 1978 [2, 3] although the disease was first recognized in England in 1971 [4] . PEDV caused widespread epidemics in several European countries during the 1970s and 1980s [5, 6] ; however, since the 1990s PED has become rare in Europe with occasional outbreaks [7] . PED was first reported in Japan in 1982 and has since been confirmed in other Asian countries such as South Korea, China, Thailand, and Vietnam [5, 8, 9] . PEDV was detected in the United States (U.S.) for the first time in April 2013 [10] . So far, at least two genetically different PEDV strains have been identified in the U.S. (U.S. PEDV prototype strain and S-INDEL-variant strain) [11, 12] . After the PED outbreak in the U.S., detection of U.S. prototype-like PEDV has been reported in Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, and South Korea [11, [13] [14] [15] ; detection of U.S. S-INDEL-variant-like PEDV has been reported in South Korea, Germany, Belgium and France [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Virus isolation has generally been used to assess if a live virus is present in samples. But for PEDV, the success rate of virus isolation in cell culture has been quite low [22] . Currently, swine bioassay remains the most reliable means to determine if infectious PEDV is present in a clinical specimen or if \"X\" treatment will inactivate the virus. However, there remains inconsistency in selecting swine models for bioassay.",

Diarrhea severity was assessed with the following criteria by both visual observation and rectal swabbing: 'normal' = no diarrhea, 'mild diarrhea' = soft (cowpie), 'moderate diarrhea' = liquid with some solid content, 'watery diarrhea' = watery with no solid content. Rectal swabs were collected daily from each pig from 0 day post inoculation (DPI) until necropsy and were submerged into 1ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 1\u00d7 pH 7.4) immediately after collection.

The cells were washed twice with post-inoculation media and incubated with 100\u03bcl/well of such media for 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Then cells were fixed with cold 80% acetone and stained with PEDV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody SD6-29 conjugated to FITC (Medgene, Brookings, South Dakota) at a 1:100 dilution for 40 min. The staining was examined under a fluorescent microscope. The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in >90% reduction of staining as compared to the negative serum control was defined as the VN titer of the serum sample. A VN titer of 8 was considered positive.",

Each batch of one liter of PEDV propagated in Vero cells (infectious titers ranging from 10 5 -10 6 TCID50/ml) were subjected to one freeze-thaw and then centrifuged at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The virus was then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 140,992 \u00d7 g for 3 h. The virus pellet was resuspended in sterile PBS (1\u00d7 pH 7.4) at a ratio of 1:100 of the original volume and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Polystyrene 96-well microtitration plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with the viral antigen solution (100\u03bcl/well) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Plates were washed 5 times, blocked (300\u03bcl/well) with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, Pennsylvania), and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. Plates were then dried at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and stored at 4\u00b0C in a sealed bag with desiccant packs until use. Serum samples were 1:50 diluted and added to the coated plates (100\u03bcl/well). Plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h and then washed 5 times with PBS (1\u00d7 pH 7.4). Subsequently 100\u03bcl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Texas, USA) at 1:25,000 dilution was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. After a washing step, 100\u03bcl of tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide substrate solution (TMB, Dako North America Inc., Carpinteria, California, USA) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by adding 50\u03bcl of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid) to each well. Reactions were measured as optical density (OD) at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader operated with commercial software (Biotek 1 Instruments Inc., Winooski, Vermont, USA). The antibody response in serum samples was represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios calculated as: S/P ratio = (sample OD-blank well control mean OD) / (positive control mean OD-blank well control mean OD). After multiple optimizations, the S/P ratios of >0.8 were considered antibody positive, 0.6-0.8 as suspect, and <0.6 as negative [27, 28] .",

A U.S. PEDV prototype strain cell culture isolate USA/IN19338/2013 was 10-fold serially diluted and tested in this study. Since there are variations among laboratories in reporting virus titer units, we determined the infectious titers of the PEDV dilutions using both end-point titration assay and plaque assay. It was found that one TCID 50 /ml is almost equivalent to one PFU/ml for PEDV. Based on a quantitative PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR we developed, PEDV with an infectious titer of 5 TCID 50 /ml or 5 PFU/ml had a Ct value of approximate 31 corresponding to about 4.8\u00d710 4 genomic copies/ml. An equation of X = 10 (Ct-47.262)/-3.3969 , where X = genomic copies/ml, was used to transform the Ct values into estimated genomic copies of PEDV RNA per ml in samples. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. First, a PEDV N gene-based primers and probe and reagents from the Path-ID\u2122 Multiplex One-",

PEDV rRT-PCRs using other primers, probe, and master mix buffer reagents may generate results somewhat different from what we obtained in this study. Second, correlations of the infectious titers, Ct values and genomic copies/ml in this study were obtained using a PEDV cell culture isolate diluted in cell culture medium. For PEDV present in other sample matrices, this correlation could have some variations. Another objective of this study was to determine the minimum infectious dose of PEDV in 5-day-old and 3-week-old na\u00efve conventional pigs. In 5-day-old pigs, 100% of pigs (4/4 pigs) became infected with 10ml of inoculum having titers 560-0.056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct 24.2-37.6); 25% of pigs (1/4 pigs) became infected with 10ml of inoculum having titer 0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct>45) ( Table 6 ). In 3-week-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560-5.6 TCID 50 /ml (Ct 24.2-31.4) resulted in 100% (6/6 pigs) infection while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56-0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct values 35.3 ->45) could not establish infection in any pigs under these study conditions ( Table 6 ). The smallest virus magnitude that can cause infection in at least one pig in a group is considered the minimum infectious dose. In the 5-day-old pig study, 4 pigs in each group were housed separately without direct contact between pigs. The minimum infectious dose of PEDV was 0.056 TCID 50 or lower in 5-day-old pigs. In the 3-week-old pig study, due to space limitation, it was not possible to house all pigs individually; however, this did not preclude determination of the minimum infectious dose in the current study because the weaned pig groups 4-6 (dilutions 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22128 ) had no single pig positive during 28 days study periods. However, if conditions allowed, for minimum infectious dose studies, pigs should ideally be housed separately during long-term study periods to avoid possible pig-to-pig transmission. The MID of PEDV was 56 TCID 50 in 3-week-old pigs under our study conditions. This suggests that the MID for neonatal pigs is at least 1000-fold lower than it is in weaned pigs.",

            "text": "Our study confirms that 5-day-old pigs are more susceptible than 3-week-old pigs to PEDV infection. PEDV progresses faster, the fecal virus shedding level is higher, and disease is more severe, in 5-day-old pigs than in 3-week-old pigs (Fig 2A and 2B) . We also observed that the response among four 5-day-old pigs in each group was comparable as reflected by similar virus shedding levels (Table 3 ) and similar microscopic lesions. In contrast, there was more variation in virus shedding among six 3-week-old pigs in each group (Table 3) . These observations were consistent with previous reports on age-dependent resistance of pigs to TGEV infection [29] . However, in either 5-day-old or 3-week-old pig models, once pigs were infected and virus replication began, the initial dose of virus appears to have little impact at the group level on the average amount of fecal viral shedding, average severity of microscopic lesions/IHC staining, or the average magnitude of antibody titer that is subsequently developed. It should be noted that the 5-day-old piglets in this study were fed a mixture of liquid milk replacer and yogurt, which were possibly devoid of IgG, IgA and other immunologic ingredients found in sow milk. Thus, the piglets raised under the current study conditions could be more susceptible to PEDV infection than piglets at the corresponding ages that were naturally nursed by sows under field conditions. Previous studies also demonstrated that PEDV infection induces greater disease severity in neonatal piglets than in weaned pigs although the minimum infectious dose of PEDV was not determined in those studies [24, [30] [31] [32] . The exact reasons for the greater severity of PED in neonatal piglets are unknown but there may be several contributing factors including: 1) an immature immune system in neonatal piglets [33, 34] ; for example, the level of natural IFN-\u03b1 production by porcine blood mononuclear cells is lower in neonates and the phagocytic cells present in newborn piglets generally have reduced phagocytic activity as compared with adult animals [35, 36] ; 2) neonatal piglets are more vulnerable to dehydration and the electrolyte and fluid imbalance [33] ; 3) the intestinal villi of neonatal piglets are longer and may have more mature permissive enterocytes than weaned pigs [37] ; 4) slower replacement of villous enterocytes (7-10 days) in neonatal pigs compared to 2-4 days in weaned pigs [38] . The virus mainly infects and destroys mature enterocytes lining the villi of small intestine, resulting in shortening and blunting of villi. But the intestinal crypt epithelial cells basically remain uninfected and serve to replace the destroyed villous enterocytes. Regeneration of villous enterocytes in neonatal piglets is not as rapid as that in weaned pigs; this may explain why villous atrophy is more severe in neonatal than in weaned pigs. Recently Jung et al [31] further demonstrated that neonatal pigs have low numbers of LGR5+ (marker for crypt stem cell) cells and low levels of Ki67 staining (marker for crypt proliferation) in contrast to large numbers of LGR5+ cells in the crypts and high proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in weaned pigs, explaining the rapid turnover or recovery rate of villous enterocytes in weaned pigs.",

Regarding duration of the swine bioassay, we observed that one pig (ID 9) in group 6 of the 5-day-old pig study did not shed virus in rectal swabs until 3 DPI; thus 2-day duration of pig bioassay may not be sufficient to evaluate the infection outcome.
