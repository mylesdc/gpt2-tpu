A strategy of minimalist miniaturization combining minimal system design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve the instrument miniaturization with extremely low cost, which is differing from the current microfabrication strategy used in most reported miniaturized CE systems. With such a strategy, the total size of the bioanalyzer was minimized to 90 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 77 mm (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) and the instrument cost was reduced to ca. $500, which demonstrated the smallest and lowest-cost CE instrument with LIF detection in so far reported systems. The present bioanalyzer also exhibited comparable analytical performances to previously-reported high-speed CE systems. A limit of detection of 1.02 nM sodium fluorescein was obtained. Fast separations were achieved for multiple types of samples as amino acids, amino acid enantiomers, DNA fragments, and proteins with high efficiency. We applied this instrument in colorectal cancer diagnosis for detecting KRAS mutation status by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.",

Since the concept of micro total analysis systems (MicroTAS) was proposed by Manz et al. in 1990, microfluidic chip technique has become the major technique for achieving miniaturization of analytical systems. Despite the great success of microfluidic technique in developing miniaturized analytical systems, the microchip-based miniaturization strategy also faces some challenges. One of the challenges comes from the requirement of expensive equipment and complicated procedure in the microfabrication of many microchips, usually including the design and fabrication of microchannel network, chip bonding and chip surface treatment processes. In addition, to achieve the miniaturization of a total analytical system means all of the modules in the system should be miniaturized and integrated, including not only microchip but also other additional modules for ensuring the normal working of the whole system. For example, a CE analyzer should include high-voltage supply, detection, system control, data processing and result display modules. Currently, addressing these challenges mainly relies on the usage of costly, time-consuming and complicated microfabricated techniques.",

This would reduce the difficulty and expense in instrument miniaturization research and production, and thus may promote the widespread development and popularization of miniaturized analytical instruments. For a high-speed CE system, the system miniaturization mainly lies in the miniaturization of three major components, sample injection, detection and overall electronic modules. Besides small size, the sample injection module should be capable of performing automated picoliter-scale sample injection with good repeatability. As for the detection module, simple structure, sensitive response and high resolution are the essential requirements. The overall electronic module is seldom mentioned in many articles in instrument development, while plays an indispensable role in achieving the miniaturization of the total analysis system. It should control the working states of all of the electronic modules in the instrument and avoid the possible interference between each other.",

            "text": "Mini Picoliter-Scale Spontaneous Injection Module. In a high-speed CE system, for ensuring high speed and high efficiency separation, picoliter scale sample injection volumes are essential. So far, two types of picoliter-scale sample injection techniques based on short capillaries [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and microfluidic chips [34] [35] [36] have been developed. The former ones include optical-gating injection 28 , flow-gating injection 29, 30 , and translational spontaneous injection 31-33 methods. The microchip-based injection methods include pinched injection 34, 35 and gated injection 35, 36 in cross channel or double-T channel. In most of the hitherto reported miniaturized high-speed CE systems, microchips were adopted because they could provide the microchannel networks for achieving picoliter-scale sample injection and CE separation, although this may lead to the evident increase in system cost and operation complexity. Differing from the nanoliter-scale injection methods commonly used in conventional CE systems, the capillary-based picoliter-scale injection techniques 28-33 also provide an alternative strategy to achieve miniaturization of HSCE systems without the need of microfabricated chips. However, this strategy also brings difficulties in achieving system miniaturization since these systems need to use large-sized components, such as high-intensity laser for optical-gating injection 28 , flow switching device for flow-gating injection 29, 30 , or mechanical translation stage for spontaneous injection [31] [32] [33] .",

            "text": "In the previous study in high-speed CE, the authors' group has developed a translational spontaneous injection method for performing picoliter-scale sample injection in a short capillary with a switchable slotted-vial array [31] [32] [33] 37, 38 . The translational spontaneous sample injection was performed by first inserting the tapered inlet end of a separation capillary into a sample reservoir, and then allowing the sample reservoir to remove from the capillary at an angle of 90\u00b0 between the reservoir moving direction and the capillary. During this removing process, a small sample droplet in the picoliter range was remained at the tip end of the capillary, and was sucked into the capillary channel immediately by the surface tension of the sample droplet, achieving picoliter-scale sample injection. Compared to the other high-speed CE systems, our systems have relatively simple structure and are easy to build and operate, which provides favorable foundation for achieving system miniaturization. However, the large-sized translation stage elements (at least tens of centimeters) are required to be used in these systems for achieving automated switching of sample and buffer vials, which forms the major difficulty in achieving further miniaturization of the sample injection module. Actually, most of commercial translation stages used in various routine instruments were designed for high precision (~10 \u03bcm) and heavy load capability (~kg), and thus with large size and weight. However, such performances far exceed the requirement of the translational spontaneous injection method with tens micrometers and tens gram load. Thus, we chose a mini translation stage with a micro stepping motor instead of the large ones to switch sample and buffer vials, which was originally used in an autofocusing module of a digital camera with a minimal size of 36 mm (length) \u00d7 8 mm (diameter) as well as extremely low cost of $2. By coupling with the system control module, the movement of the mini stage could be automatically controlled with forward and backward direction in 17-mm effective moving distance with a positioning precision of ca.10 \u03bcm, which is sufficient for switching the sample and buffer vials. After optimizing the mini-stage moving velocity, step length, and interval time, the mini injection module could achieve picoliter-scale sample injection (e.g. 90 pL as shown in Fig. 3a and b) under the translational spontaneous injection mode, which substantially ensures the high speed and high efficiency performance of the present bioanalyzer.

Confocal LIF systems usually have high sensitivity and high spatial resolution, however, their complexity and critical structure as well as difficulties in system construction appear to limit the miniaturization of the systems. In an orthogonal LIF system, the laser exciting and fluorescence collection paths are separated, which could effectively reduce the background signal without complex optical components. Such a system has simpler structure and is easier to be miniaturized.",

            "text": "For building the compact LIF detection module, we adopted three measures. First, we used optical components with size as small as possible, including a laser diode (18 mm length, 12 mm diameter) as light source, two small collimating lenses for laser beam focusing and fluorescence collection, and a photodiode (9 mm length \u00d7 6.2 mm diameter) as optical detector instead of a photomultiplier. The collimating lens consists of three lenses and has a small size of 8.7 mm length \u00d7 9.6 mm diameter and 7.0-mm focal distance. It has excellent focusing property, with which a focusing spot of 10 \u03bcm for the laser beam could be obtained at the center of the capillary channel. The photodiode was chosen due to its small size compared with normal or even miniaturized photomultiplier modules, though, which in turn would lead to the reduce in detection sensitivity of the LIF module. Second, to compensate the loss in sensitivity by using the photodiode and further improve the detection sensitivity, we employed a high-intensity laser diode (80 mW) to increase light source intensity and the 45\u00b0 deviated orthogonal LIF detection mode 37 to decrease the background scattering light intensity. In conventional orthogonal LIF systems, the fluorescence collection angle of 90\u00b0 to the capillary at the plane perpendicular to the laser beam is commonly used. In our previous study 39 , we observed that such an angle was not an optimal solution. When changing the collection angle to 45\u00b0 to the capillary at the same detection plane, the fluorescence signal to background noise ratio could be significantly increased due to the reduce of background signal and reach to a maximum value higher one order of magnitude than 90\u00b0. As a result, a limit of detection of 1.02 nM for sodium fluorescein solution was obtained with the present LIF module, which is comparable to many of convectional and micro LIF detection systems [40] [41] [42] . Third, to ensure the compact size of the LIF module, we designed and fabricated a monolithic holder from a black ABS block to achieve the integrative assembly of all of the components in the holder including the laser diode, collimating lenses, capillary, filter, and photodiode, with a total module size of 44 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 40 mm. We tested the detection ability of the LIF module using sodium fluorescein as model sample by alternately introducing different concentration fluorescein solutions and borate buffer (pH = 9.2) solution into the capillary. A linear relationship was obtained from 5 to 100 nM sodium fluorescein with a regression equation of F = 6.29 C + 31.8 (R 2 = 0.999) (Fig. 2c) , and a typical signal recording of 5 nM sodium fluorescein is shown in Fig. 2d . The calculated limit of detection for fluorescein is 1.02 nM. Although this detection limit is higher than those of some high-sensitive LIF systems usually with LODs from 10 pM to 10 nM 2,33,43-45 , such a detection ability could be comparable to many of reported desktop LIF systems with photodiode detectors 46, 47 , or even with PMT detector 48 . Considering its extremely small size and low cost of $150, such a detection performance could be accepted for a miniaturized bioanalyzer. In the following applications including analysis of real PCR products and RFLP digestion products (see section of \"Application in analysis of KRAS gene mutation\"), the LIF module has showed sufficient performance to meet the detection requirements.",

The microcontroller manipulates the mini translation stage and high voltage module via the driving chip LB1838 and one built-in DAC12. The built-in ADC12 replaced the commonly used DAQ card to acquire the fluorescence signals. The signal data were processed by the controller, and the TF card was connected to the microcontroller via the built-in USART interface and served as data storage media. The entire CE analysis operation, including laser and high voltage controlling, translation stage driving, and signal acquiring, filtering, display and storage, was realized by the minimized printed circuit board with a size of 62 \u00d7 55 mm.

It has been reported that the KRAS mutation status plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis and treatment of CRC. Therefore, it has become a standard detection of gene status to CRC therapy. In this study, we used the bioanalyzer to detect the mutation of KRAS proto-oncogene. KRAS locates in the chromosome 12, and encodes a P21 protein which is closely related to tumor formation, proliferation and migration. We carried out PCR-RFLP for detecting KRAS point mutation in codon 12 of three types of CRC cells, SW480, HT29 and CCL-187 cells, with gene statuses of mutant, wild-type, and heterozygote, respectively. A 107-bp fragment of KRAS was first amplified from DNA templates extracted from the three CRC cell samples via mismatched primer PCR. Then, the PCR products were directly digested by Mva I restriction endonuclease via RFLP. Finally, the RFLP digestion products with SYBR Green I were loaded in the bioanalyzer for CE separation. To ensure the analysis reliability, we quantitatively added a 200-bp internal standard in each sample to calibrate Fig. 5 . The resolution length (i.e. the smallest difference in DNA base pairs that can be resolved) of the present bioanalyzer was 9.6 bp for 30 bp to 107 bp DNA fragments. The PCR products of three genotype show similar results (Fig. 5a) , while the RFLP digestion products have diverse results (Fig. 5b) . For wild-type KRAS, the 107-bp fragment could be completely cleaved into 77-bp and 30-bp fragments by the restriction endonuclease (Fig. 5b2) . However, the amplicon from the mutant KRAS template could not be digested due to the loss of recognition site and thus maintained 107 bp as the original one (Fig. 5b1) . The amplicon from heterozygous template was half-digested, showing three peaks of 30 bp, 77 bp, and 107 bp (Fig. 5b3) . Such results are consistent with those of routine gene mutation analysis method with slab gel electrophoresis, which demonstrates the present bioanalyzer could be used to distinguish whether a KRAS gene mutates and which mutation status it has on the basis of the fast CE separation results. With the present instrument, separation time was evidently reduced from tens of minutes by slab gel electrophoresis to 1.5 min, which substantially speeds up the identification of the PCR and digestion products. Furthermore, the compact size of the palmtop instrument also allows it to be conveniently used as a handy tool, such as a pipette, to rapidly get the PCR identification results on-site once after the PCR amplification experiment.",

Actually, to our knowledge, it is the smallest high-speed CE apparatus with LIF detection reported in the literatures. It is commendable that the analyzer was built mostly using simple and cheap components, and thus had extremely low instrument cost of $500. The effectiveness and broad application potential of the palmtop bioanalyzer have been extensively demonstrated in analysis of multiple different types of samples including actual analysis of gene mutation, with separation performances comparable to other miniaturized and large-size high-speed CE instruments.",

This strategy combines minimalistic system design and low-cost system construction, to simplify the system structure as much as possible, and thus to reduce the difficulty and cost in instrument miniaturization and application, with comparable analytical performance to desktop systems. It mainly relies on the essential understanding to the working principle of the analytical system and the use of previous innovation achievements (e. g. the translational spontaneous 29, 30, 36 and 45\u00b0 deviated orthogonal LIF detection 37 ) in system design, as well as the employment of various commercially-available small components currently-used in multidisciplinary fields (e. g. the mini-stage and collimating lens) and low-cost fabrication methods in system construction. The experimental results successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this strategy in miniaturized instrument development. Such a strategy provides a novel train of thought and solution for development of miniaturized analytical instruments. We expect it could be adopted in the miniaturization of other types of analytical instruments, and may also has potentials in promoting the widespread popularization of instrument miniaturization study and products in various routine laboratories due to its simple and low-cost features.",

Also due to the uses of some miniaturized and low-cost modules, the analytical performance of the instrument could not reach the highest levels of separation speed and efficiency as the desktop CE systems.
