Whole blood analysis of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets was performed in a cross-sectional study involving 262 nursing home elderly participants and immune phenotypes were compared to immune phenotypes from healthy adults. In addition, we explored how individual immune phenotypes were influenced by age, sex, frailty and nutritional status in the nursing home elderly [10] . We observed lower na\u00efve CD8+ T-cells (CD8+CD45RA+CCR7+) and higher terminally differentiated memory T-cells (CD8+CD45RA+CCR7-) and senescent T-cells (CD8+CD282) when compared to healthy adults [10] , consistent with prior findings in elderly people [11] [12] [13] [14] . It is hypothesized that the reduced numbers of na\u00efve CD8+ Tcells observed in the elderly due to thymic involution, coupled with an accumulation of poorly functioning terminally differentiated memory T-cells and senescent cells possibly arising from chronic antigenic stimulation by cytomegalovirus (CMV) [15, 16] , predisposes elderly people to infection [17] .",

The following antibodies were purchased from BD Bioscience: anti-CD4-Pacific Blue, anti-CD28-PE, anti-CCR7-PE-Cy7 and anti-CD25-PE. The following antibodies were purchased from eBioscience: anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD127-PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-FoxP3-AlexaFluor700. The anti-CD3-Qdot605 was purchased from Invitrogen.

CD4+ and CD8+ immune phenotypes and T-regs were expressed as a percentage of CD3+. Antibody staining was performed using a Beckman Coulter Biomek NX p Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Ontario) as previously described [29] , followed by analysis using an LSR II flow cytometer with a high-throughput sampler (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA). T-regs were analyzed using FlowJo 9.6 (Treestar Inc, Ashland, OR). T-cell subset analysis employed an automated gating pipeline using the flowDensity algorithm [30] . This approach uses customized threshold calculations for the different cell subsets to mimic a manual gating scheme based on expert knowledge of hierarchical gating order and 1D density information. Population identification is individually tuned to each cell population in a data driven manner. T-cell subpopulations were identified using characteristics of their density distribution such as the number of peaks, height and width of each peak, change of the slope in the distribution curve, standard deviation, and median density ( Figure S1 ). CD45RA thresholds were estimated based on control samples, which where then applied automatically to stimulated samples. CCR7 thresholds were estimated based on CD57+ populations given the explicit instruction that CD57+ cells are CCR7-( Figure S1 ). A total of 17 populations identified by this approach using high performance computing resources at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre in order to reduce computational time.",

In the event a resident had multiple respiratory viral infections, only the first infection was included as an outcome. If a participant died prior to a respiratory viral infection, their time was censored on the date of death. We hypothesized that the following immune phenotypes associated with immunosenescence would be associated with increased risk of infection [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 21] : low CD4+ and CD8+ na\u00efve T-cells and high CD4+ and CD8+ terminally differentiated and senescent T-cells as well as high CMV-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and high Tregs. Low was defined as immune phenotypes in the first quartile of the distribution and high was defined as immune phenotypes in the fourth quartile of the distribution. A priori, it was decided that age, sex and frailty would be included in the final model, given their potential for confounding with the effects of primary interest in this population [32] . Immune phenotypes with a p-value ,0.20 in univariable analysis were included in the final multivariable model. The final model was determined using backwards elimination. A sandwich variance estimator was used to account for the clustering effect at the level of the nursing homes [33] . The proportional hazards assumption for continuous variables was explored graphically by plotting partial residuals against time to event and tested by regressing the partial residuals against time. The proportional hazards assumption for categorical variables was examined by a log-minus-log graph to ensure the plotted lines remained parallel. The presence of multicollinearity was examined using the variance inflation factor (VIF); presence of multicollinearity was defined as VIF .5.",

            "text": "T-regs are responsible for creating the balance between the immune response to pathogens and the harmful sequelae of inflammation that arises with this response [35] . High T-regs have been consistently observed in elderly people when compared to healthy adults [10, 21] , and it has been hypothesized that this shift may be associated with increased risk of infection seen in the elderly [21, 36] . It is intriguing that in our study higher levels of circulating T-regs were associated with reduced risk of symptomatic respiratory virus infection. We did not systematically test all residents in our study for respiratory virus throughout the study, so we cannot determine whether the association between high T-regs and reduced risk of infection was due to absence of infection or whether there was a higher incidence of asymptomatic infections in the high T-reg group. Little is known about the role of T-regs in preventing acute respiratory viral infection in humans [35] . In mice, a robust T-reg response has been observed during influenza [37] and RSV infection [38] and depletion of T-regs delays RSV viral clearance from lungs [38] suggesting that T-regs play an important role in controlling the immune response to respiratory [39] . In consideration of the murine data, we speculate that elevated levels of T-regs may suppress immune pathology associated with anti-viral immunity. CMV has been proposed as the chronic antigenic stimulus responsible for accelerated immunosenescence, including the accumulation of senescent CD8+ T-cells [40, 41] . There have been at least three studies looking at the association between CMV infection and influenza vaccine response in the elderly [20, 42, 43] . In one, CMV was associated with influenza vaccine non-response [20] , however two other studies found no association [42, 43] . In contrast to the reports on seropositivity, we focused on the T-cell response to CMV and observed that elevated frequencies of CMV-reactive CD4+ T-cells, but not CMV-reactive CD8+ Tcells, were associated with an increased risk of respiratory viral infection. We are unaware of any other study linking CMV-reactive CD4+ T-cells to increased risk of respiratory viral infection. It is difficult to speculate on the possible biological relationship between the CMV-reactive CD4+ T cells and susceptibility to infection. Given the observation that CD4+ Tregs also correlate with susceptibility, we interpret these collective data as an indication that the distribution of functional cells (i.e. effector, suppressor, Th1, Th2, etc\u2026) within the CD4+ T cell compartment has a strong influence on host resistance in the elderly. Most research to date has focused on CD8+ T-cells in the elderly and these observation strongly support a new line of research in the elderly to understand how and why skewing of the CD4+ T-cell compartment contributes significantly to the outcome of respiratory infection.",

Although there were associations between these immune phenotypes and risk of respiratory viral infection in univariable analyses, after adjustment for known confounders such T cell phenotypes were defined using the flowDensity software package. Lymphocytes were first gated from non-margin events, and then singlets were gated. CD45RA thresholds were calculated based on singlet lymphocytes FMO. CD3+ cells were gated and then separated into CD4+CD8-and CD4-CD8+. Expression of CD57, CD28, CD45RA and CCR7 was analyzed on either CD4+CD8-or CD8-CD4+. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108481.g001 as age, sex and frailty, CD8+ T cells were not predictive of respiratory viral infection once all immune phenotypes with suspected association with respiratory viral infection were included in the model.

            "text": "This study provides insights into the role of immunosenescence and the risk of respiratory viral infection in elderly nursing home residents. Although our study was designed to identify associations and not causation, our findings suggest the possibility that strategies to boost circulating T-regs [45] or vaccines to prevent infection with CMV [46] or prophylactic anti-viral therapy to prevent re-activation of CMV may reduce respiratory viral infections in this high-risk population. In addition, those identified at increased risk of respiratory viral infection could be offered alternative prevention strategies such as heightened surveillance during the highest risk periods, which could help prevent nursing home outbreaks and transmission to healthcare workers and their families. Limitations of this study include lower than expected influenza viral infection. Although influenza is not necessarily the most common virus isolated in nursing homes, [1] , we expected to see more than 21 cases in 1072 residents during the influenza season based on prior respiratory viral infection surveillance studies conducted in nursing homes [1, 2] . We do not believe that cases were missed. Indeed, we performed prospective active surveillance for symptomatic respiratory viral infection, and approximately one third of the nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for virus, comparable to another study, which performed active surveillance for respiratory infections in nursing homes in Canada [2] . Instead, we believe the lower numbers were due to circulation of pandemic H1N1, an influenza strain that had less impact on older people during the 2009-2010 influenza season than pre-pandemic years and the relatively low incidence of influenza during 2010-2011 influenza season [47] . In addition, the lower numbers could have been due to the fact that we only included residents who had been vaccinated against influenza. We felt that influenza vaccination status was too important a confounder to manage statistically, both because of its potential ability to prevent influenza infection and because of its association with the healthy user bias [48, 49] . It remains possible that there are different immune predictors for each of the different respiratory viruses in this vaccinated cohort and combining the respiratory viruses together in one combined endpoint limited its generalizability; however we chose a priori to combine the respiratory viruses together in a combined endpoint based on the fact they result in similar outcomes in this population [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The low number of participants with influenza precluded our ability to perform a sensitivity analysis, looking at immune phenotypes predictive of influenza infection. An additional limitation was that we were unable to include immune phenotypes as continuous variables in the analysis. In general, maintaining data as continuous is preferred over categorizing data [50] ; however an analysis including immune phenotype data as continuous was not feasible as it led to estimates with wide confidence intervals. Thus, the analysis was performed using categorized variables, similar to other aging studies [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Although seventy-three participants died prior to developing a respiratory viral infection, we do not believe this competing risk introduced significant bias. Competing risks are unlikely to bias the result when the follow-up is short, or the proportion of participants experiencing a competing risk is less than the proportion of participants experiencing the outcome [56] . In this study, the follow-up was short (only one influenza season) and the proportion of participants who died was less than those who developed a respiratory viral infection. Last, these results were obtained in a frail elderly population and may not be generalizable to community dwelling elderly.",
