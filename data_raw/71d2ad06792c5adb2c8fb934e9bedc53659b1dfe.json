            "text": "Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has typically a non-immune mediated origin in cats and immunecomplex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) is scarcely described. Aims of this study were to characterize ICGN by light and electron microscopy and identify associations with clinico-pathological findings. In addition, comparisons between cats with ICGN and non immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN) were performed. Renal samples examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were performed. Signalment, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage were retrieved and used for comparisons. Results: Sixty-eight client-owned cats were included. Thirty-seven cats (54.4%) had ICGN and 31 (45.6%) non-ICGN. Eighteen (48.6%) with ICGN had membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN), 14 (37.8%) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and 5 (13.5%) mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MeGN). Clinico-pathological data were not associated with any type of ICGN. Among cats with non-ICGN, 11 (35.5%) had end-stage CKD, 9 (29%) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 6 (19.4%) global and multifocal mesangiosclerosis, 2 (6.5%) glomerular atrophy, 2 (6.5%) renal dysplasia and 1 (3.1%) amyloidosis. Eight (25.8%) cats with non-ICGN had chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) grade 1, 13 (41.9%) grade 2 and 10 (32.3%) grade 3; creatinine and UPC ratio increased with CIN grades (p = 0.001, p < 0.001). Cats with ICGN were more frequently FIV or FeLV-infected (OR:11.4; 95%CI:1.4-94.4; p = 0.024), had higher UPC ratio (OR:6.8; 95%CI:2.5-18.2; p < 0.001) and were younger (OR:0.9; 95%CI:0.7-1.0; p = 0.042) than cats with non-ICGN. Conclusions: MGN and MPGN were the most common morphological diagnoses of ICGN in cats. Unfortunately, none of the investigated findings differentiated ICGN morphological diagnoses. Serum creatinine concentration and UPC ratio were directly associated with grades of CIN (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), confirming previous literature. More ICGN than non-ICGN was observed in cats with retroviral infections, younger cats and higher UPC ratio.",

            "text": "Recently, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Renal Standardization Study Group (WSAVA-RSSG) has provided criteria to diagnose glomerular diseases in dogs based on light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as immunofluorescence [1] . According to the WSAVA-RSSG, two broad diagnostic categories have been identified, namely immune-complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) and non-immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN) [1] . Because specific morphological criteria for glomerular diseases have not been reported in cats, the above classification scheme is commonly adopted in the feline species. However, to date only few reports of ICGN in cats have been published and membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN) was reported most frequently [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , often associated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection [4, [6] [7] [8] . ICGN has also been described in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) positive cats and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MeGN) was the most common lesion [9] . Further, MeGN has been reported in a cat with cyanotic congenital heart disease, as observed in humans who developed transient proteinuria and edema [10, 11] . In addition, feline coronavirus leading to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has been associated with various types of ICGN, including MGN, MeGN and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) [12] . Finally, MPGNs resembling human type I and III have been described in two cats [3, 13] , as well as proliferative, necrotizing and crescentic ICGN in a cat [14] .",

It is usually documented in aged cats and chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) associated with secondary glomerular involvement is the predominant morphologic diagnosis [15] [16] [17] . However, no studies have detailed the ultrastructural lesions in the glomeruli of these cats, thereby reducing diagnostic specificity and sensibility. Based on the severity of interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration, CIN is currently histologically classified according to a scale that ranges from 0 to 3, in ascending order of severity [17] . The amount of fibrosis represents the lesion that best correlates with the severity of azotemia, hyperphosphatemia and anemia, while glomerular hypertrophy correlates best with the severity of proteinuria [17] .",

This differs from previous investigations where MGN was the most frequent form of ICGN in cats [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . One possible explanation is that the number of FeLV-positive cats with ICGN was very low (only 3 cases) compared to former studies [4, [6] [7] [8] , and this retrovirus infection has been associated most commonly with the development of MGN [7] . Of note, ICGN was not associated with breed, age, gender, serum creatinine concentration, UPC ratio and SBP. Therefore, unfortunately, the above clinical and laboratory findings cannot be used in daily practice to predict the type of ICGN.

This result confirms that cats with ICGN are more likely to present with significant proteinuria, whereas some may have lesser degrees of protein loss. However, clinicians should be aware that cats with a higher degree of proteinuria might not necessarily have ICGN, but a non-immune complex disease such as amyloidosis or focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with high CIN grade. Therefore, any therapy with immunosuppressive drugs should be carefully considered and in light of immune deposits potentially detected at TEM.",

A possible explanation is that retroviral infections play a role in glomerular damage by promoting deposition of immune complexes derived from viral antigens and host antibodies [6, 7] . A marked increase of circulating immune complexes has been demonstrated in FIV-positive [23] . Although the overall number of retrovirus-infected cats was relatively low in this study, FIV was three times as common as FeLV and cats with the former disease had various types of ICGN. In previous studies, ICGN was often associated with FeLV infection [4, [6] [7] [8] , while in FIV-positive cats ICGN was infrequent and only MeGN was reported in these cases [9] . Thus, the data from the current study suggest that infection with FIV may underlie ICGN in cats and may lead to different types of ICGN. Moreover, occurrences of ICGN and non-ICGN were not associated with breed, sex, creatinine concentration and SBP values. Of note, cats with non-ICGN would be expected to have higher creatinine compared to cats with ICGN because tubulointerstitial damage is typically associated with reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased serum markers of renal function [16] .",

Indeed, incomplete records were present and information pertaining to serum albumin concentrations or to ascites was scant. However, because missing data were documented both in ICGN and non-ICGN cats, the bias was likely reduced. Another important limitation is that blood tests and urinalysis were performed in different laboratories, with reference ranges that might have differed. In addition, the UPC ratios provided in this study were likely based on single determinations in most cats without accounting for day-to-day variability of proteinuria. However, the authors assume that the potential bias of having different laboratories and collection of single urine samples were probably evenly distributed among morphological diagnoses and disease categories, reducing its confounding effect. Another limit of this study is the lack of immunofluorescence data. Indeed, immunofluorescence as well as LM and TEM may help characterizing glomerulonephritis in cats and provide a complete evaluation of renal biopsies.",

Unfortunately, clinical and laboratory findings were not useful to differentiate among specific types of ICGN. In cats with non-ICGN, only serum creatinine concentration and UPC ratio were significantly associated with CIN grades. Cats with ICGN were more likely to be infected with FIV or FeLV, had more severe proteinuria and were younger than cats with non-ICGN. Similar to dogs, renal biopsies in cats with glomerulopathy should include both LM and TEM examination in order to achieve a final morphological diagnosis and, potentially, to tailor treatment.",

Additionally, kidney samples obtained from cats autopsied for any disease were included if a non-ICGN was identified. Cases were considered if renal samples were collected within 1 h from death and if there was an adequate amount of tissue to achieve diagnosis with both LM and TEM. Furthermore, the last available clinical and laboratory data reported in medical records were retrieved if obtained within a month prior to renal sampling. Sixty-eight cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 37 (54.4%) were diagnosed with ICGN and 31 (45.6%) with non-ICGN. Among cats with ICGN 21 (56.8%) were neutered males and 16 (43.2%) were spayed females. None of the cats was intact. The mean age was 9.2 \u00b1 3.3 years (median: 9 years; minmax: 4-15 years). Of cats with non-ICGN, 19 (61.3%) were spayed female and 12 (38.7%) were neutered male. None of the cats was intact. Mean age was 10.9 \u00b1 3.3 years (median: 11 years; min-max: 4-17 years).",
