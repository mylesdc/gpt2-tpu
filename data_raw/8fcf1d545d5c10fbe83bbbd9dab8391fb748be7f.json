The potency of OFSCs on macrophage proliferation and pro-inflammation ability were determined. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, inducible immuno-modulatory factors in OFSCs, were investigated. Deep sequencing analysis as well as interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and genes of immuno-modulators in OFSCs induced by activated macrophages was predicted by miRTar. Transfection of miRNA inhibitor into OFSCs was performed. Real-time RT-PCR and transplantation of OFSCs into mice with LPS-induced ALI confirmed the in vitro and in vivo mechanism. Results: The paracrine effect of OFSCs on inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine release was more potent than induction of macrophage G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. OFSCs-CM suppressed LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthetase and the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta expression in macrophages. Under non-contact culture, LPS-activated macrophages effectively triggered the expression of soluble immuno-modulating factors in OFSCs, i.e., IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF RII). Under miRTar prediction, miR-671-5p was identified as a critical microRNA in regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors in OFSCs response to macrophages. The baseline level of miR-671-5p was high in OFSCs, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p upon co-culture with activated macrophages was observed. MiR-671-5p inhibitor transfection into OFSCs selectively enhanced the IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expressions. In addition, inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability against LPS-induced ALI.",

Only a few studies report that MSCs derived from bone marrow or gingiva promote the generation of regulatory macrophages (M2) [17] [18] [19] [20] . Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) produced by MSCs serves as a key factor for inhibiting macrophage-mediated inflammation in acute lung injury (ALI) [21] . Our previous work demonstrates that orbital fat-derived stem cells (OFSCs), MSCs isolated from human orbital fat tissues [22] , are effective in modulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation [23] . The therapeutic effect of OFSCs in vivo is attributed to inhibition of macrophage-mediated inflammatory response, and the paracrine effect of OFSCs contributes the major therapeutic benefit. However, the circulation cytokine profile altered by OFSCs is not identical to that altered by bone marrow-derived MSCs in mice with ALI.",

As shown in Figure 3 , neither LPS nor OFSCs-CM altered IFN\u03b3 expression in macrophages ( Figure 3A ). OFSCs-CM effectively inhibited the proinflammatory ability of macrophages in the first 6 hours by reducing TNF\u03b1 (Figure 3B ), IL-1\u03b1 ( Figure 3D) , and IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 3E ) expressions triggered by LPS. Twenty-four hours later, the protein levels of TNF\u03b1 ( Figure 3C ) and IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 3F ) in macrophages were also reduced by OFSCs-CM.",

Our previous in vivo study demonstrated that systemic OFSC transplantation enhanced the serum level of sTNFR type II in mice with LPS-induced ALI [23] . In the present study, OFSCs did express these immunomodulating factors when co-cultured with na\u00efve macrophages (Figure 4) . Furthermore, gene expression of IL-10 ( Figure 4B ), IDO ( Figure 4C ), sTNFR type II ( Figure 4D ) and IL-1RA ( Figure 4E ) in OFSCs were highly upregulated by LPS-activated macrophages within 6 hours of noncontact culture. TGF\u03b2 was not affected upon coculture ( Figure 4A ). silencing mainly through miRNAs, deep-sequencing analysis and miRTar prediction were performed to identify the potential endogenous miRNAs in OFSCs, MSCs derived from subcutaneous tissue as well as MSCs derived from bone marrow targeting on inducible, secreted immunomodulating factors reported in MSCs (that is, IL-6, IL-10, IDO, hepatocyte growth factor, TGF\u03b2, sTNFR type I, sTNFR type II, and IL-1RA). Seven miRNAs were found to potentially regulate the above genes by target prediction ( Table 2 ). For OFSCs, the expression levels of hsa-miR-28-5p, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-769-5p (transcripts per million < 1,000) were too low to act as a regulator for immunomodulation. hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-370, and hsa-miR-423-5p were strongly expressed in OFSCs (transcripts per million > 2,000) but each of them targeted only one gene, making them less possible as the key regulator in this study. Hsa-miR-671-5p had a strong expression level (transcripts per million = 5,140) in OFSCs and potentially regulated those genes upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages, including IL-10, sTNFR type II and IL-1RA (Figure 4) , indicating that miR-671-5p may be the key miRNA in OFSCs regulating inducible immunomodulating factors under procytokine stimulation. miR-671-5p regulates OFSC immunomodulation ability by targeting sTNFR type II and IL-1RA",

We showed that miR-671-5p expression was significantly downregulated in OFSCs when co-cultured with activated macrophages ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, we identified the direct targets of miR-671-5p by transfection of miR-671-5p inhibitor into OFSCs. As shown in Figure 5A , miR-671-5p inhibitor successfully reduced the miR-671-5p expression in OFSCs both under normal conditions and co-culture with activated macrophages. Inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs resulted in increasing the mRNA level of sTNFR type II and IL-1RA, but not IDO and IL-10 ( Figure 5B) . Notably, the binding sequences of miR-671-5p to sTNFR type II ( Figure 5C ) and IL-1RA ( Figure 5D ) demonstrated that the binding affinities between miR-671-5p and these two targets were strong, which is evidenced by a low minimal free energy and a high miRanda alignment score ( Figure 5C,D) . OFSCs expressed the low protein level of sTNFR type II and no IL-1RA protein could be detectable in OFSCs ( Figure 5E ). However, protein levels of both sTNFR type II and IL-1RA in OFSCs were increased after inhibiting miR-671-5p, which confirmed that cytokine levels in response to miR-671-5p were in line with the mRNA expression values ( Figure 5E ). The above findings confirmed that sTNFR type II and IL-1RA were direct targets of miR-671-5p.",

The results showed that the redox status in a LPS-damaged lung parenchyma was significantly reduced by both OFSCs and OFSCs with preinhibition of miR-671-5p ( Figure 6A ). Tissue sections showed that LPS triggered the inflammatory cell infiltration into interstitial space of lung parenchyma, and increased lung permeability by fluid accumulation in alveolar space ( Figure 6B ). OFSC transplantation ameliorated lung permeability and inflammatory in the first 6 hours ( Figure 6C) . Moreover, less cell infiltration and larger alveolar space were noted in ALI mice receiving miR-671-5p-inhibited OFSCs compared with those mice receiving OFSCs ( Figure 6D ), demonstrating that preinhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs further enhanced the anti-inflammation ability in lung parenchyma without altering the antioxidative ability in OFSCs ( Figure 6A ).",

In this study, we find that LPS triggers the proinflammatory ability of macrophages (Figures 1, 3 A and 7A), while OFSCs inhibit the proinflammatory activities (Figures 1, 3 and 7B) and induce cell cycle arrest ( Figure 2 ) in macrophages through the paracrine effect. LPS-activated macrophages excite the immunomodulatory capacity of OFSCs via upregulation of IDO, IL-10, sTNFR type II and IL-1RA (Figures 4 and 7B,C) . Among these factors, sTNFR type II and IL-1RA in OFSCs are negatively regulated by miR-671-5p under normal conditions ( Figures 5 and 7A) , and can be rapidly upregulated by degradation of miR-671-5p in OFSCs triggered by activated macrophages (Figures 4, 5 and 7B) , which enhances the anti-inflammatory ability of OFSCs (Figures 6  and 7C ). According to our data, the condition medium from OFSCs significantly reduced the proliferation and proinflammatory ability in macrophages (Figures 1, 2 and 3) , and the immunomodulatory ability of OFSCs could be induced by noncontact culture with LPS-activated macrophages (Figure 4) , indicating that paracrine effects of OFSCs play an important role in macrophage regulation. In addition, the therapeutic potency of OFSCs for attenuating macrophage-mediated inflammation was stronger ( Figure 1B ) than inducing macrophage cell cycle arrest (Figure 2A) . It is known that the number ratio of MSCs versus immune cells is critical for the therapeutic effect of immunomodulation in MSCs regulating lymphocytes (MSC/lymphocyte ratio > 0.1) [6, 31, 32] or natural killer cells (MSC/natural killer cells from 0.1 to 1) [15, 33] . We demonstrated that a ratio of OFSCs versus macrophages \u22651 (Figures 1B and 3) initiates anti-inflammation, while a ratio \u22652 initiates induction of macrophage cell cycle arrest (Figure 2) .",

Macrophages resident in tissues can be polarized as proinflammatory macrophages (M1) or M2 by the microenvironment [35, 36] . M1 exhibit proinflammatory activity to activate T-helper type 1 lymphocytes, while M2 promote T-helper type 2 responses via increasing phagocytic activities [34] [35] [36] . Different from bone marrowderived MSCs and gingiva-derived MSCs, OFSCs did not promote M2 generation ( Figure 1C ) but did significantly reduce the proinflammatory function of M1 by inhibition of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3 ) in the first 6 hours, indicating that orbital fat-derived MSCs regulate macrophages by targeting M1 rather than M2. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of M2 polarization induction by OFSCs through direct cell-cell interaction or longterm paracrine stimulation. In addition, we did measure the miR-671-5p expression in MSCs derived from different tissue origins. The data showed that miR-671-5p is strongly expressed in OFSCs, is moderately expressed in MSCs derived from subcutaneous fat tissue, and is at a very low level in MSCs derived from bone marrow ( Table 2 ), indicating that regulation of M1 by miR-671-5p may predominantly exist in adipose tissue-derived MSCs. IDO secretion from MSCs participating in immune tolerance and anti-inflammation could be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 [11, 12, 15, 16, 31] . From our data, LPS-activated macrophages enhanced the expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 ( Figures 3B,C,D) , and IDO in OFSCs was responsible for LPS-activated macrophage ( Figure 4C ). In addition to IDO, IL-10, sTNFR type II, and IL-1RA in OFSCs were also induced by activated macrophages (Figure 4) . IL-10 is a strong inhibitor for proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release from activated macrophages [37] . N\u00e9meth and colleagues report that bone marrowderived MSCs reduce mortality and improve organ function in experimental cecal ligation-induced sepsis directly through increasing IL-10 production from LPS-activated macrophages [38] . According to our data, LPS-activated macrophages could also upregulate IL-10 expression in OFSCs ( Figure 4B ), and enhancement of IL-10 may justify the effect of OFSCs on suppression of macrophage proinflammatory cytokine release.",

MSCs release IL-1RA to antagonize IL-1\u03b1 and to block TNF\u03b1 release from activated macrophages [21] . TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 are two critical cytokines initiating a series of inflammatory response in vivo [40] , and IL-RA-expressing MSCs can modulate the inflammatory response in mice with bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis [21] . In addition to IL-1RA, sTNFR type I and sTNFR type II are other inhibitory soluble molecules found in body fluid as well as tissues that reduce the toxic effects of TNF\u03b1 in the body [41] . sTNFR type II is one of the proteolytic shedding soluble extracellular domains of the tumor necrosis factor receptors secreted primarily by mononuclear cells [42] . Administration of TNF\u03b1 or LPS to human MSCs increases the concentration of sTNFRs in the medium, suggesting that soluble receptors may be part of a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the biological effects of TNF\u03b1 [43] . Yagi and colleagues report that the therapeutic effect of an intramuscular injection of human bone marrow-derived MSCs in endotoxemic animals is dependent on the secretion of sTNFR type I [43] . Our previous work demonstrated that systemic OFSC transplantation upregulated serum level of sTNFR type II, not sTNFR type I, in the first 6 hours after intratracheal injection of LPS [23] . In this study, we demonstrated that both IL-1RA and sTNFR type II expressions in OFSCs were consequences in response to IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 secretion by LPS-activated macrophages ( Figure 4D,E) .",

            "text": "Recently, miRNAs have been identified as critical regulators of immune responses [44, 45] , and LPS stimulation may alter the expression of miRNAs in macrophages [46] [47] [48] . MiR-155 is upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages in response to TNF\u03b1 interrupting macrophage differentiation and toll-like receptor 4 transcription [47] [48] [49] . In contrast, miR-125b is downregulated in LPS-treated macrophages for inhibiting TNF\u03b1 expression [48] . However, we disclosed that miR-671-5p in MSCs derived from orbital fat tissues played a role in regulation of IL-1RA and sTNFR type II. Although miR-671-5p was predicted to interact with IL-10, IL-1RA and sTNFR type II (Table 1) , only sTNFR type II and IL-1RA were directly inhibited by miR-671-5p ( Figure 5B,C,D) . Reduction of miR-671-5p in OFSCs in a macrophage-mediated proinflammatory environment ( Figure 5A ) resulted in the upregulation of sTNFR type II and IL-1RA in OFSCs ( Figures 4D,E and 5B) , which contributed to the anti-inflammation ability of OFSCs in vivo ( Figure 6D ).",
