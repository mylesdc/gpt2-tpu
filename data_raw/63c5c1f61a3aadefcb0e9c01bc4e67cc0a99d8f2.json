            "text": "The World Health Organization estimates that acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the second leading cause of childhood death, and about 70% of these infections occur in Africa and Southeast Asia. 1 ARIs are responsible for 20% to 40% of children hospitalizations, and their course of infection is more severe in children aged less than 5 years. 2 ARIs are caused by a variety of pathogenic infectious agents including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, of which viruses are the most predominant. The viruses associated with ARIs are classified as \"old respiratory viruses\" and \"novel respiratory viruses.\" The \"old 6 Fungal ARIs in children are rare and are found mainly in immunocompromised patients. 7 The acquisition and spreading of ARIs vary among study populations in different countries. This may be due to children's malnutrition, the low socioeconomic status of the country, cultural habits in the community, patient's immune deficiency, local/regional geographical and climate change, and the variability of the health care systems in public and private hospitals. Consequently, the morbidity related to ARIs is mostly observed in the developing world. 8 On the other hand, the expanding number of pathogens identified as a causative agent of ARIs might be due to the introduction of molecular techniques such as the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR, qRT-PCR) in routine. These assays have increased the sensitivity and specificity of detection and allow the identification of a wide range of viruses and bacteria in one reaction. This will be helpful for the better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARIs. 9 However, in most developing countries, the application of multiplex assays has not been fully implicated in the routine laboratory testing due to their high costs. As far as the Arab Maghreb is concerned, laboratories perform mostly enzyme immunoassays, rapid diagnostic tests, or latex agglutination techniques for some frequent pathogens, but no routine tests using qPCR assays are generally available. Owing to the absence of detailed diagnostic testing, infections are managed empirically by antibiotic regimens, resulting in an overuse of broadspectrum antibiotics, favoring the development of bacteria (bacterial resistance). 10 In Tunisia, studies on the etiology of a large range of respiratory microbes across the seasons, among various ages and genders-and with the application of molecular and sensitive assays-are limited. A Tunisian study published by el Moussi et al in 2013 reports the distribution of the most common respiratory viruses using a multiplex assay. However, no association between viral infection and sociodemographic situation of patients or the seasonal distribution of detected pathogens was observed by this study. In addition, bacterial identification was excluded. 11 In light of this, in the present study, a total of 18 viruses associated with ARIs were analyzed using a sensitive multiplex molecular assay. In addition, detection of the bacterial genomes M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae was performed. Moreover, the demographic characteristics of the detected pathogens, as well as their seasonality, were analyzed. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the most common respiratory microbes in the area of Sousse, Tunisia. Such findings will help to reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, thus, avoiding bacterial resistance and contributing to the implementation of prevention and control systems in Tunisia.",

In spite of the common knowledge that RSV A/B is the most common respiratory agent responsible for ARIs, RV was found to be more prevalent in this population, which highlights the interest of cost benefits studies concerning its implementation in the routine laboratory testing. Given the multiplicity of these findings, this study provides a useful starting point for a better understanding about the circulation of these pathogens in the area of Sousse and the seasonal/ demographic attributable to viral/bacterial infection. It will contribute data relevant to the development of prevention strategies, which will help in clinical decisions and allow considering antiviral therapy in clinical routine. The availability of vaccines in Tunisia only against InfVs infections will afford ongoing vaccine research and development on many other leading viral pathogens in future.",

If the discrepancy may be due to the different tests used in the studies or the appearance of CoV as a more frequent pathogen found in Tunisia remains to be investigated.Furthermore to CoVs, ARI due to AdV was frequent in this study and its total positive rate was17.8% in which 77.1% of its infections were in infants. Most of the AdV infections were detected in combination with other viruses (46/92 AdV infections). This observation is in contrast with the reports described by Huang et al in 2011 and Liu et al in 2015, in which AdV was more detected in single infections. 27,28 Because there are no prospective and because of the large randomized controlled trials of AdV infections, the treatments of this pathogen are controversial. PIV infection has been described in 10.8% of enrolled cases. In line with other publications, PIVs were reported in 10.0% to 11.5% of all acute respiratory hospitalizations, respectively. 29-31 Likewise, this study found that PIV-3 was the most detected virus within the PIV group. It has been described in the literature that the epidemics of PIV-3 respiratory infection are responsible for considerable economic losses due to hospitalizations, medical costs, and mortality in children worldwide. 30,31 Additional pathogens were described in this study and accounted for less than 10.0% of the infections, including MPV A/B, BoV, PeV, EV, and InfVs group. MPV A/B was reported in 8.7% of specimens, in which 23/45 of them were coinfected with other respiratory viruses and only 2/45 were monoinfected. Dual infections between MPV A/B and RSV A/B have been reported widely in the literature. However, our finding shows that only seven MPV A/B-RSV A/B coinfections were detected. This result is supported by Cebey-Lopez et al's 25 study, in which a low proportion of monoinfection by MPV A/B was described.",

            "text": ",35 In the present study, it was of significance to describe the circulation of EV and PeV in ARIs in the area of Sousse. In 5.8% and 7% of the 515 enrolled subjects, EV and PeV were detected, respectively. The lowest prevalence of ARIs in this study has been attributed to the InfVs group with an infection rate by 1.8%. This finding was not cited by other studies in which InfVs ARIs were frequent.26 The rare presence of InfVs infection in the study population could be related to the age of patients in which all enrolled subjects were aged below 1 year.As described above, M. pneumoniae was not detected in any specimen. The absence of M. pneumoniae mediated ARI in this study BRINI KHALIFA ET AL. could be elucidated by the rare frequencies of M. pneumoniae infections in neonates and infants. A similar finding was reported by Halaji et al36 showing that M. pneumoniae ARI in children aged 1 month to 15 years is infrequent (7/150 positive samples).In addition to the respiratory viruses/bacteria screened in this study, negative infections were found. In 66 samples (12.8%), the multiplex assay showed neither respiratory viruses nor M. pneumonia infection. However, within the 12/66 negative samples, the additionally performed uniplex qPCR for S. pneumonia appeared to be positive. Alternatively, the remaining negative samples (54/66) did not contain any pathogen that was screened for and the ARI may be not linked to infectious conditions. This may be due to the presence of pathogens not covered by the multiplex approach of this study.Bacteria genome detection by qPCR identified S. pneumoniae in 159 out of 515 tested samples (30.9%). The high prevalence of S. pneumoniae in children hospitalized with ARIs is supported by other studies, showing that pneumonia, acute cough, bronchitis, and lower ARIs are often caused by infections with viruses or S. pneumoniae. 37 In addition, S. pneumoniae could be found to colonize the nasopharynx during RSV A/B infection in young children, which was associated with increased severity. 38 In accordance, 82.6% of S. pneumoniae infections were coinfected with a respiratory virus in which RSV A/B was the most identified pathogen. With the changes occurring in the demographic situation of patients, the environmental characteristics, the seasonality, and social habits throughout the world, the emergence of new respiratory pathogens still increases each year. This consequence makes clinicians more confused about which pathogen is responsible for ARIs, and thus preventions should be taken to minimize the risk of ARIs or the circulation of nosocomial infections in the community. Thus, regardless of the above, the findings listed in the present study need to be interpreted in consideration with the limitations of this study. First, the data were collected only from a single study site (FH-UH of Sousse). Second, this study was conducted for a short study period (September 2013-December 2014). Due to the sampling size collected during this year, the wide range of tested pathogens, and the costs of materials and reagents, it was not possible to increase the sampling period. Although this study permits the detection of a wide range of pathogens, it is focused on the identification of viruses and neglects a wide range of other infectious pathogenic agents (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) responsible for the manifestation of severe respiratory diseases. Finally, it would be interesting to include the patient's clinical manifestations and their association with viral/bacterial infection. In contrast to data from older children, we had, unfortunately, no access to clinical manifestations of neonates.",
