Amount of research were conducted and excellent achievements were disclosed during the past years. However, as far as we know, there is no comprehensive review about TFs. Scope and approach: This review summarized the recent research progress. The activity of TFs on anti-oxidation, anti-mutagenicity, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral effect as well as the epidemiological cure were sorted. Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs. Meanwhile, oxidation pathway of two catechin molecules to form TFs were hypothesized. Also, ascertainment of the several therapeutic efficiency of the family members of TFs would be the next step in the future.",

[1] , theaflavins (TFs) [2] , characterized with the structure of benzotropolone as shown in Figure 1 , were presented extensively in fermentative tea [3] . Due to their therapeutic attributions, TFs were regarded as the 'golden molecules' separated from tea (Camellia sinensis, fam. Theaceae). Meanwhile, TFs were also the crucial molecules that decide the quality and grade of black tea, the most consumed tea all over the world [4] . As the smallest tea-pigments, TFs were clarified to have positive correlation with the liquid color of black tea [5, 6] . On the other hand, TFs also could accelerate the mellow and fresh degree of black tea infusions. Sensory analysis revealed that TFs imparted a mouth-coating, astringent, and long-lasting oral sensation at the back of the throat. It was demonstrated that TFs had by far lower oral thresholds than the astringent catechins, and accounted for less than 0.1% of the overall astringency of the teas investigated [7] .",

As known, the anti-oxidative activity refers to polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). As the dimer of catechins, it is appropriate that TFs possess excellent anti-oxidative activity [8] . Generally, the existence of double bond at C 2 -C 3 as well as the 4-OH in the skeleton of flavonoids, which was conjugated with the benzene ring, would benefit the formation of a more stabilized intermediate, which may enhance the antioxidant ability of flavonoids to some degree [9] . Though, with steric hindrance, oxygen atoms on the chromane skeleton still showed electronwithdrawn effect strongly. Meanwhile, benzotropolone as well as the hydroxyl and carbonyl on it, could generate a more stable conjugated system than flavonoids. Based on these advantages, the hydroxyl on benzotropolone would be more active in the removal of radicals.",

Taking human LDL oxidation as a model, Leung et al. [12] demonstrated that TFs possessed at least the same antioxidant potency as catechins. The study of anti-oxidative activity of TFs conducted by Su et al. [13] showed that all of the four TFs were more powerful than BHT in the anti-oxidation; and the hierarchy is TF 3 > TF 2 = TF 1 > TF. On the other hand, spectroscopic studies showed that all the TFs could chelate iron and copper ions, which would be helpful for the anti-oxidative mechanism research into TFs.",

The order of 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging ability was TF 3 > TF 2 = TF 1 > EGCG > TF [19, 20] . Similarly, TF showed significant protection against the t-BHP induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decrease in protein carbonyl (PCO) and sulfhydryl group (-SH) content [21] . A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted by Arent and co-workers [22] , to exploit the effect of TFs on the responses of human subjects to acute anaerobic interval training. The result showed that consumption of TF-enriched black tea extract led to improved recovery and reduction in oxidative stress, and delayed onset muscle soreness responses to acute anaerobic intervals.",

Using a cell model for inflammatory response, Gosslau and coworkers [35] , showed that TF 2 suppressed the 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced COX-2 gene expression, and also down-regulated TNF-\u03b1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ICAM-1, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). As a similar mechanism, TF 3 aided the protection of colonic inflammation [36] . Meanwhile, TFs significantly protected neurons from cerebral I/R injury by limiting leukocyte infiltration and expression of ICAM-1, and suppressing up-regulation of inflammatory-related pro-oxidative enzymes (iNOS and COX-2) in ischemic brain via reducing the phosphorylation of STAT-1 [37] . Inhibiting the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor as well as decreasing the level of mucin 5AC, TFs relieved airway mucous hypersecretion, which might be valuable in the treatment of chronic airway inflammation [38] .",

Furthermore, TF 3 could inhibit the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, such as the epidermal growth factor and PDGF receptors in A431 cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells [47] . In the area of LNCap, TF 3 showed inhibitory activity via suppressing the expression of the androgen receptor and lowering androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen secretion and fatty acid synthase protein levels [48, 49] . In other words, TF 3 was deemed to be a potential chemoprevention agents for prostate cancer. Among a set of pro-apoptotic genes, TF 2 quickly induced the up-regulation of p53 and BAX, suggesting mitochondria as the primary target [35] . Gao et al. [50] showed that ascorbic acid enhanced the apoptosis of human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A-1 cells and esophageal carcinoma Eca-109 cells induced by EGCG and TF 3 via mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Due to the generation of H 2 O 2 , TFs revealed cytotoxicity of cells from the human oral cavity, which could be decreased with the presence of Co 2+ or catalase. Fortunately, compared to normal cells, both malignant carcinoma cells and immortalized cells were more sensitive [51, 52] . By the way, hydrolysis of theaflavin gallates mediated by salivary esterases indicated the possible use of theaflavins in the prevention of oral cancer and dental caries [53] . Without adversely affecting normal human epidermal keratinocyte cells, inhibition of A431 and A375 cell proliferation induced by TFs were reported. And the molecular mechanism predicted that TFs arrested the cell cycle through Bax translocation and inducing apoptosis via mitochondrial death cascade [23] .",

[66] disclosed that a benzotropolone skeleton is formed from co-oxidation of appropriate pairs of catechins, one with a vic-trihydroxy moiety, and the other with an ortho-dihydroxy structure. Isolation of the intermediate proepitheaflagallin, shown as in Figure 2 , revealed that production of theaflavin was via a bicyclo [3.2.1]octane-type intermediate [67] . Based on this pioneering literature [68] , and taking the endogenous and exogenous factors in consideration, the underlying formation mechanism of theaflavin related to enzymatic acceleration, and also physical-chemical transformation was hypothesized, as shown in Figure 3 . With the mediation of enzymes, two catechin molecules were oxidized to quinone equally. Diphenol quinone was formed with the dimerization of the quinones. On the other hand, the polymerization of quinones would result in the formation of thearubigins as well as theabrowin. Sequentially, a bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octane-type intermediate, proepitheaflagallin was generated. It is noteworthy that proepitheaflagallin was an interactive quinone, the reduction of which would product bisflavanol. With further oxidization and dienone-phenol rearrangement, the motif of theaflavin was constructed.",

It is evidenced that unequal depletion rates of di-and trihydroxylated catechins led to a decline in total TFs and an increase in TB levels [5] . An equitable decline in both groups of catechins corresponded to a subsequent rise in theaflavins content. Decline in the catechins levels was much faster at higher temperatures. And this resulted in a shorter fermentation time to achieve maximum TF content.",

Intricate investigation was required to ascertain the therapeutic efficiency of the monomers within the theaflavin family. In respect to thermal and pH-dependent stability, it is concluded that GTC in green tea, in general, is more stable than TF in black tea. The lower the pH value of the sodium phosphate buffer, the greater the stability. When incubated in a buffer of the same pH, TF was much more unstable than GTC. Among the four TF derivatives, TF 3 and TF 2 had relatively slower rates of destruction than the other two [76] . Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, simultaneous determination of catechins and theaflavin were achieved [77] . Together with preparative HPLC, separation of TFs could be achieved through high-speed countercurrent chromatography by gradient elution [78, 79] .
