            "text": "Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age \u226565 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcareassociated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.",

Outbreak investigations and scientific studies conducted during or after MERS hospital outbreaks have identified that aerosol-generating medical procedures with improper or inadequate personal protective equipment place medical personnel and patients sharing wards with MERS patients and family visitors at higher risk for MERS-CoV infection 29, 30 , with exposure to infectious droplets being the likely source of contamination. Although close unprotected contact with a MERS patient is generally considered necessary for human-to-human transmission 31 , several studies have revealed that MERS-CoV particles can persist on surfaces as long as several days, raising the possibility of a role of fomites in transmission 32, 33 . Fomite transmission is further supported by observed viral spreading between rooms that were clearly separated 15, 18 and outbreaks that occurred in hemodialysis units 14, 15 .",

In 2015, contact tracing became more systematic with the identification and follow up of high (close, unprotected contact) and low risk contacts (protected HCW). In affected countries, National Ministries of Health and hospital staff comprehensively list all contacts of known MERS patients, including healthcare workers at all facilities/departments the patient visited, patients who shared wards/ rooms with MERS patients, family and visitors and occupational contacts. Follow up of contacts includes the testing of all high-risk contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms. Recommendations stated that positive contacts are placed in quarantine (home or hospital isolation for asymptomatic or symptomatic secondary cases, respectively) until they test negative 41, [44] [45] [46] . Additionally, affected countries enhanced infection prevention and control procedures education, and training, and implemented visual triage systems 41 to reduce delays in testing, isolation and care of suspected MERS-CoV patients. This has again been recently illustrated by the lack of secondary cases following the identification of a confirmed case of MERS in Korea in September 2018 47 was due to the rapid and comprehensive isolation, treatment and management of contacts of the patient.",

There is no evidence to suggest that this represents changes in virus pathogenicity, epidemiology or transmission www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ patterns of MERS in recent years. However, the increase in the number of reported asymptomatic cases is hypothesized to be due to earlier detection efforts from more aggressive contact identification and testing during HCA-outbreaks since 2015 as testing policies adopted and implemented by KSA and other countries have changed following the large outbreaks in Jeddah/Riyadh in 2014 3, 41, 54 . In 2017, 40-80% of the laboratory confirmed HCP secondary cases experienced no symptoms and were detected as part of a policy to test all contacts irrespective of symptoms (Table 1) . We believe that the identification of HCP asymptomatic cases, and their subsequent isolation, has had a strong impact on prevent further human to human transmission in health care settings. This is visually demonstrated in Fig. 1C by the outbreak labelled SAU16_2, which included 26 (of 30 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ reported cases) asymptomatic cases. While this is a large number of secondary cases, we argue that the early identification, isolation and recovery of these asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases effectively stopped human to human transmission.",

Without detailed information on the timing of interventions in each health care facility it was not possible in our analyses to determine which intervention or combination of interventions had the greatest impact on stopping the MERS outbreaks. Moreover, prior to 2015, contacts without symptoms were not tested for MERS-CoV infection, thus the rate of identification of secondary cases was drastically different prior to 2015, which complicates the comparison of data collected before and after 2015. The improvements in data reporting on cases (e.g., more systematic reporting of underlying conditions, reported exposures, contacts between patients) from 2015 allowed us to perform better analyses with less missing values.",

These are the hallmark of effective MERS-CoV control. A combination of interventions including the efficient triage of patients with respiratory symptoms at hospital entry; limiting wait times and overcrowding in waiting areas; isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; appropriate use of droplet personal protection equipment by HCP; basic hand hygiene; increased protective aerosol precautions for HCP during aerosol-generating medical procedures; efficient surface and environmental decontamination of areas with MERS patients, and extensive contact tracing, can prevent human to human transmission in health care settings.",
