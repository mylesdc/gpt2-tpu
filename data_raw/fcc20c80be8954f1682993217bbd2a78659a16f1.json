            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory illness in humans with a high fatality rate. Since its emergence, MERS-CoV continues to spread to countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula and gives rise to sporadic human infections following the entry of infected individuals to other countries, which can precipitate outbreaks similar to the one that occurred in South Korea in 2015. Current therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In search of new potential drug candidates, we screened a library composed of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds. The drug saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), was identified as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Our results suggest that saracatinib potently inhibits MERS-CoV at the early stages of the viral life cycle in Huh-7 cells, possibly through the suppression of SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, saracatinib exhibited a synergistic effect with gemcitabine, an anticancer drug with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. These data indicate that saracatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.",

The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in humans range from asymptomatic to severe lower respiratory tract infections with the potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiorgan failure resulting in death [9, 10] . Due to high morbidity and mortality rates, therapeutic options of MERS-CoV were immediately adapted from previous reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) therapies including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and/or mycophenolate mofetil, but none of them were effective in randomized controlled trials [3, 11] .

After overnight incubation of the cells at 37 \u2022 C, equal volumes of MERS-CoV inoculum (multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0.1) and compound dilution (final concentration of 20 \u00b5M) were added and incubated at 37 \u2022 C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for three days. On day three, post-infection (p.i.), cell viability was measured using the CellTiter 96 \u00ae AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was measured using a Synergy TM H1 multi-mode microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). Percent inhibition was calculated using the values of maximum infectivity derived from infected cultures treated with 0.5% DMSO (virus control, 0% inhibition) and background derived from mock-infected treated with 0.5% DMSO (cell control, 100% inhibition) as references using the formula ([sample \u2212 virus control]/[cell control \u2212 virus control] \u00d7 100). The statistical validity of the MERS-CoV primary screening system was determined by calculating for the Z'-factor using the values derived from virus control and cell control wells [20] . For the primary screening, a Z'-factor \u22650.5 and a coefficient of variation (CV) among the controls \u226410% was used to validate the results of the assay. The antiviral activity of hit compounds was determined from the dose-response curve (DRC), and the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) and the compound-specific toxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ]) were calculated with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) using the non-linear regression formula: log (inhibitor) vs. response-variable response (four parameters) model.",

The primary screen of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds (final concentration of 20 \u00b5M) identified 63 compounds with MERS-CoV antiviral activity above the cut-off (>47% inhibition), yielding a hit rate of 2.6% ( Figure 1A ). The average Z' score during the primary screen was 0.80 \u00b1 0.08, indicating that the assay was robust and reliable for the detection of potential MERS-CoV inhibitors ( Figure S1 ). Further confirmation of the antiviral activity of selected compounds against MERS-CoV infection was performed by testing them in complete dose-response analyses ranging from 0.62 \u00b5M to 50 \u00b5M and the EC 50 and CC 50 values were determined. Using this method, we determined 12 hit compounds, primarily classified as antiprotozoal, anticancer and antipsychotics, active against MERS-CoV with micromolar EC 50 values ranging from 2.1 \u00b5M to 14.4 \u00b5M ( Table 1) . Among the identified hits, saracatinib (AZD0530, Figure 1B ) was particularly promising as it exhibited prominent antiviral activity with an estimated EC 50 of 2.9 \u00b5M and a CC 50 of >50 \u00b5M, resulting in selectivity index (SI) of approximately >17 ( Figure 1C ). Prior to proceeding further, we tested whether saracatinib displayed antiviral activity against different strains of MERS-CoV. Huh-7 cells were infected with the recombinant MERS-CoV (rMERS-CoV) derived from the EMC/2012 strain and a cell culture adapted variant derived from this virus (rMERS-CoV-S2). From the results, saracatinib exhibited an EC 50 of 9.3 \u00b5M and 9.0 \u00b5M against rMERS-CoV and rMERS-CoV-S2, respectively, suggesting a broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV activity of the drug ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, saracatinib showed a broad-antiviral activity against other human coronaviruses such as hCoV-229E and OC43 with an EC 50 2.4 \u00b5M and 5.1 \u00b5M, respectively, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) with an EC 50 of 7 \u00b5M within a non-toxic range of concentrations (Table S2) .

            "text": "To investigate which step(s) of the MERS-CoV life cycle were affected by saracatinib, a time-of-addition/removal experiment was performed. Saracatinib (10 \u00b5M) was added to Huh-7 cells either 1 h prior to (pretreatment), during (co-treatment), 1 h or 4 h after infection (post-treatment) with MERS-CoV ( Figure 3A ). At 24 h p.i., the amount of released virus particles into the cell culture supernatant was determined by plaque assay. As shown in Figure 3B , saracatinib treatment prior to infection resulted in a similar viral titer when compared to untreated cells, indicating that the blockage of cellular receptor(s) was not its mode-of action. To clarify the possibility that saracatinib interacts directly with virus particles or cellular receptors, virus attachment was performed at 4 \u2022 C in the presence or absence of saracatinib. After 1 h adsorption, cells were washed and replenished with fresh media followed by incubation at 37 \u2022 C to allow virus internalization. The virus titer in cell culture supernatant from saracatinib-treated cells during incubation at 4 \u2022 C was similar to that of untreated cells, suggesting that saracatinib does not interact either with the virus particles or cellular receptors [23] . In contrast, the addition of the drug during virus infection at 37 \u2022 C resulted in a marked reduction of the viral titer ( Figure 3B , co [p = 0.08]) as well as a significant decrease in the intracellular viral genomic RNA and mRNA expressions ( Figure S2 ). Moreover, the reduction of MERS-CoV titer became more pronounced when 10 \u00b5M saracatinib was added 1 h after virus inoculation indicating that the drug interfered with the early stages of viral replication after internalization ( Figure 3B , post 24, 25] ). The antiviral activity became less effective when saracatinib was added after 4 h post-inoculation ( Figure 3B , post [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 24, 25] ). The inhibitory effect was prominent on the accumulation of intracellular MERS-CoV RNAs. The syntheses of both intracellular viral genomic RNA and mRNAs were severely affected upon treatment of the drug when added 1 h (post 24, 25] ) after virus inoculation ( Figure S2 ). To more precisely understand the time window of the saracatinib-mediated inhibition of MERS-CoV replication, 10 \u00b5M saracatinib was added to infected cells at different time points after infection and remained present until sample collection ( Figure 3C ). At 24 h p.i., infectious particles and intracellular MERS-CoV genomic RNA and mRNAs were quantified as mentioned above. As shown in Figure 3D -F, saracatinib added within the first 2 h p.i. resulted in a significant reduction (~80%) in infectious virus titers and near complete inhibition of both viral genomic RNA and mRNA syntheses. Together, these data suggest that saracatinib most potently inhibits the early stages of MERS-CoV life cycle after internalization. ",

The combination index (CI) was calculated according to the methods of Chou et al. [14] and analyzed using CompuSyn software. The 2-drug combination of saracatinib with gemcitabine showed a considerable synergistic antiviral effect with a CI value of 0.529 (CI < 1, =1, and >1 indicated synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively; Table 2 ). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the combined treatment with 2-drugs showed no differential cytotoxicity when compared to that of saracatinib alone. Importantly, a combination of saracatinib with gemcitabine showed less cytotoxicity than gemcitabine alone in Huh-7 cells, indicating that it is suitable for use in low-dose combination therapy than the individual drugs used alone ( Figure 6 ).

Saracatinib (AZD0530), developed for the treatment of tumor malignancies [25] , was identified by screening anti-MERS-CoV activity of 2334 approved drugs and biologically active molecules using a CPE-based HTS assay. From the primary screening, we identified several drugs including chloroquine, amodiaquine, and chloropromazine analogs that have previously been reported as inhibitors of the MERS-CoV by other groups [13, 14] , indicating the validity of our screening results. In addition, we found two neurotransmitter inhibitors, dosulepin and hydroxyzine pamoate, with different chemical core structures to those previously reported that inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in vitro at micromolar concentrations. Moreover, a protein kinase C inhibitor, sotrastaurin, undergoing clinical trials for the prevention of organ transplant rejection and psoriasis treatment [29] , also blocked MERS-CoV infection in Huh-7 cells with an EC 50 of approximately 9.7 \u00b5M with low cellular toxicity (CC 50 > 50 \u00b5M). However, the SI of these molecules were limited (<10) when compared to that of saracatinib, which was selected for further studies.",

            "text": "Our data showed that saracatinib inhibited MERS-CoV replication by reducing virus titers at a micromolar range. The production of infectious virus particles as well as syntheses of viral genomic RNA and mRNAs were severely affected when saracatinib was added to cells and left for the first 4 h of virus infection while its antiviral effect was significantly reduced when the drug was added after 4 h of infection, suggesting that the drug inhibits the early stages of the MERS-CoV life cycle. Subsequently, we aimed to identify the target(s) of saracatinib involved in MERS-CoV infection by the RNAi-depletion of Fyn, Lyn, Src, and Yes, expressed in Huh-7 cells. Our data showed that knockdown of Fyn or Lyn resulted in a significant reduction in MERS-CoV titers, although the effects were less severe when compared to those of saracatinib treatment. The difference could be explained by the fact that saracatinib is a pan-SFK selective agent that potently inhibits several members of SFKs as well as other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Abl [25] , suggesting that multiple kinases might be involved in MERS-CoV infection. In addition, the ubiquitous expression of some members of SFKs leads to a high level of functional redundancy where the remaining SFK members compensate for those that are functionally inactive. Regrettably, we could not definitely determine whether the depletion of Src kinase activity alone or in combination with other members of SFKs had a detrimental effect on MERS-CoV replication due to the experimental limitations of using siRNA-based knockdown assays. This is particularly important since previous studies have demonstrated that multiple members of SFKs, especially the Src, Fyn, and Yes kinases, often in conjunction with Abl kinase, play an important role in the life cycle of various viruses [39, [47] [48] [49] . Recently, Coleman et al. indicated that Abl2, the imatinib target, was required for efficient SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in vitro [17] . In a follow up study, Sisk et al. [50] demonstrated that Abl kinase activity and associated pathways were involved in the coronavirus fusion step with endosomal membrane as well as cell-cell fusion that occurs late in infection. Thus, we speculate that the anti-MERS-CoV activity of saracatinib is mediated similarly via the inhibition of multiple members of SFKs including Fyn/Lyn together with Abl2 kinase. The exact mechanism of the action of multiple members of SFKs together with Abl2 kinase and associated pathways involved in MERS-CoV replication is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

Along these lines, a previous study on the kinome analysis of MERS-CoV infection indicated that ERK/MAPK intermediates, in particular MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, play important roles during the course of infection [16] . Similarly, in the closely related murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), inhibitory effects on phosphorylation of the substrate ERK1/2 by specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 resulted in the strong suppression of MHV propagation at the step of viral RNA synthesis in culture cells [52, 53] . From these findings, we inferred that the suppression of SFK resulted in the negative regulation of downstream signaling responses such as ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, which in turn have adverse effects on coronavirus replication. However, the effects of saracatinib on these various signaling pathways remain to be further elucidated.",

To overcome these limitations, we evaluated the combined effects of saracatinib with another chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine, with a different mechanism of action to compensate for any drug resistance that may arise. Gemcitabine, an FDA-approved anticancer drug, is a deoxycytidine analog that interferes with normal DNA/RNA synthesis through the inhibition of ribonucleoside reductase [55] . Previous studies have shown that gemcitabine exhibits a broad spectrum antiviral effect against several RNA viruses including the influenza virus, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses [14, 28, [56] [57] [58] . Co-treatment of saracatinib with gemcitabine showed a synergistic antiviral effect and minimal cytotoxic effect, supporting the idea of using them in a combination therapy to potentiate efficacy at non-toxic concentrations as well as to overcome any drug resistance issues.",

In addition, we identified Fyn and Lyn kinases as additional host factors involved in MERS-CoV infection. Thus, our results support the view that host kinases, such as SFKs, play important role in coronavirus infection. Similarly, other FDA-approved kinase inhibitors can be tested for antiviral activity against human coronaviruses and used as tools to identify novel host kinases involved in virus replication. Moreover, the in vitro synergistic antiviral effect of saracatinib in combination with gemcitabine against MERS-CoV infection suggests that lower therapeutic dosage may be used to prevent any toxic side effect that the drug may have at therapeutic concentration. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the potential use of clinically validated SFK kinase inhibitors for the future development of new therapeutic options for highly pathogenic coronavirus infection such as MERS-CoV.",
