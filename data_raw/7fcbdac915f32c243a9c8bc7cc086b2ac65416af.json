Mice were exposed to a single or repeated dose of PM, after which the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokines, and chemokines in the lungs of infected mice were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and histopathological analysis. Results after single and repeated PM stimulation with PM + + 2.5 , PM \u2212 2.5 , PM 10 , and PM \u2212 10 indicated that TLR2 and TLR4 played a dominant role in the inflammatory responses of the lung. Further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 increased significantly, which could eventually contribute to lung injury. Moreover, biological components in PM were critical in mediating immune-related inflammatory responses and should therefore not be overlooked.",

Air pollution caused by ambient PM is a growing problem not only in developing countries but also in the developed world and has resulted in severe hazards for public health (1) . Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to respirable PM is critical in the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as it is strongly associated with cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity in exposed populations, especially in susceptible ones (2) . According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, particle pollution includes inhalable coarse particles between 10 and 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM 10 ) and fine particles less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM 2.5 ). Numerous studies have suggested that fine particles (PM 2.5 ) are more closely associated with both acute and chronic respiratory effects, as well as subsequent mortality, than coarse particles (PM 10 ) due to their smaller size, larger surface area, deeper airway penetration, and greater ability to be retained in the lungs (3) .",

To meet those dietary demands, live bird markets (LBMs) have been established in nearly all cities in China, mostly in densely populated areas. The airborne elements of LBMs contain several harmful biological components (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and influenza virus), and in recent years, the emergence of various highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs), including H5N1 (7), H7N9 (8) , and H10N8 (9) , in China has presented a serious threat to people's health. It has been reported that these highly pathogenic AIVs can be isolated from LBMs (8, (10) (11) (12) , and that LBMs are potential hubs for the transmission of AIVs, which can survive there for prolonged periods (13) . As early emergency investigations have also shown, LBMs are likely to play an important role in disease transmission (14) , which suggests that exposure to airborne PM of LBMs can pose health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and live poultry-slaughtering workers.",

(24) indicated that microbial materials adsorbed on the dust can aggravate the degree of lung injury. In our research, endotoxin levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were also detected using LAL assay. It is well recognized that endotoxin is associated with a constituent of the outer cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria and is a known trigger of airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. Some studies with animal models suggest that exposure to endotoxin can result in the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways (32) , a result that also reflects the importance of biological components of PM. A significant increase in the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 proteins was moreover observed in the acute phase model. In previous research on smoke-induced changes in cytokines and chemokines, Kubo et al. (33) found that a single instance of cigarette smoke exposure can lead to significant increases in the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MCP-1. Taken together, both studies indicate that the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MCP-1 can be upregulated in acute lung injury in both mice and guinea pigs. The expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the PM + 10 -treated and PM + 2.5 -treated groups were significantly greater than in the PM \u2212 10 -treated and PM \u2212 2.5 -treated ones (p < 0.05). Furthermore, expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 in the PM + 10 -treated group were slightly greater than in the PM + 2.5treated group. The most likely explanation for that phenomenon is that the biological components are primarily associated with PM 10 versus fine and ultrafine PM.",

Specifically, lung injury in the PM + 10 -treated and PM + 2.5 -treated groups was significantly worse than in the PM \u2212 10treated and PM \u2212 2.5 -treated ones; the alveolar walls were noticeably thickened, and marked infiltration of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils into the alveoli were observed compared with the PM \u2212 10 and PM \u2212 2.5 groups. The reason for that phenomenon most likely relates to the biological components of PM.",

IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-8, and IP-10 are considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of lung injury in the chronic phase model followed by IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1, and MCP-1. In addition, the expression of those cytokines and chemokines in the PM + 10 -treated and PM + 2.5 -treated groups were markedly greater than in the PM \u2212 10treated and PM \u2212 2.5 -treated ones. The results also suggest that the immunological reactivity between the two sizes of particle seems only to be slightly different; the reason for these results may be due to the fact that some of the top five bacteria in PM 2.5 and PM 10 were identical.",

This effect of PM is likely due to the fact that the biological components of PM play a vital role in lung injury in the chronic phase model, or that PM 2.5 is more efficiently retained in the alveolar lung portion and causes more severe lung injury than coarse fraction PM (i.e., PM 10 ) due to its smaller size.",
