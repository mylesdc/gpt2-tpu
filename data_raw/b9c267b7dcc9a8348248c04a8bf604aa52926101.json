            "text": "Although B cell depletion is an effective therapy of multiple sclerosis (MS), the pathogenic functions of B cells in MS remain incompletely understood. We asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) B cells in MS secrete different cytokines than control-subject B cells and whether cytokine secretion affects MS phenotype. We blindly studied CSF B cells after their immortalization by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in prospectivelycollected MS patients and control subjects with other inflammatory-(OIND) or noninflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) and healthy volunteers (HV). The pilot cohort (n = 80) was analyzed using intracellular cytokine staining (n = 101 B cell lines [BCL] derived from 35 out of 80 subjects). We validated differences in cytokine production in newly-generated CSF BCL (n = 207 BCL derived from subsequent 112 prospectively-recruited subjects representing validation cohort), using ELISA enhanced by objective, flow-cytometry-based B cell counting. After unblinding the pilot cohort, the immortalization efficiency was almost 5 times higher in MS patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). MS subjects' BCLs produced significantly more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared to control BCLs. Progressive MS patients BCLs produced significantly more tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and lymphotoxin (LT)-\u03b1 than BCL from relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. In the validation cohort, we observed lower secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in RRMS patients, compared to all other diagnostic categories. The validation cohort validated enhanced VEGF-C production by BCL from RRMS patients and higher TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 secretion by BCL from progressive MS. No significant differences among diagnostic categories were observed in secretion of IL-6 or GM-CSF. However, B cell secretion of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and GM-CSF correlated significantly with the rate of accumulation of disability measured by MS disease severity scale (MS-DSS). Stein et al.",

(A) Coded, in-vitro expanded EBV-immortalized CSF BCL were manually counted and resuspended at 1 \u00d7 10 6 B cells/mL. This B cell dilution was then used to seed plates for cytokine detection, while, simultaneously, 1 \u00d7 10 6 B cells from this aliquot were stained with PI and mixed with 1 \u00d7 10 6 fluorescently (APC)-tagged microbeads (same batch used for the entire validation cohort) for flow cytometry analysis. (B) B cell/microbead mixture was serially diluted three times at 1:3, before their proportional enumeration by flow cytometry. (C) Flow cytometry output quantified microbeads based on APC fluorescence signal and B cells based on size and granularity. Live B cells in cultures were gated as PI-negative, as dying B cells intercalate PI stain into DNA, altering their emission profile. Numbers of live B cells were plotted against APC microbeads for all 3 dilutions to derive patient-specific linear regressions, from which exact number of live B cells seeded and activated in cytokine-secretion assays was calculated, based on known (and equal among all subjects in the validation cohort) number of fluorescent microbeads. The efficiency of immortalization correlated weakly with CSF cell count (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.337, p = 0.00299) and with CSF IgG index (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.391, p = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ).",

Therefore, we modified EBV immortalization method to enhance its efficacy by seeding 10,000-25,000 CSF cells into a single well (Protocol B, see section Methods) for the independent validation cohort. This precluded us from validating the differences in EBV immortalization efficiency, but this observation from the pilot cohort had a very low p-value and therefore low Type II error. Instead, the goal of the validation cohort was to transform sufficient number of BCL from MS controls and PMS patients to disprove or validate differences in VEGF, TNF-\u03b1, and LT-\u03b1 secretion among MS and controls and the relationship of these cytokines to the MS phenotype.",

We hypothesized that our inability to detect some cytokines commonly secreted by B cells (such as IL-10 or IL-6) in the pilot cohort was a consequence of this technical problem of ICCS. ELISA eliminates this problem, but it poses another: the results are highly dependent on the exact number of seeded cells. Thus, instead of relying solely on manual cell counts, we implemented an unbiased flow-cytometry-based normalization of detected cytokine concentrations to live B cell numbers (Figure 1 and section Methods) among all tested subjects. In addition to studying VEGF (A and C isoforms were studied separately) and TNF-\u03b1, LT-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 to refute or validate findings from the pilot cohort, we also analyzed de novo two additional cytokines with putative role in MS, IL-1\u03b2, and GM-CSF (33).

MS-DSS is derived from statistical learning. In contrast to an older measure of MS severity, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)based MS Severity Score (35) , MS-DSS can predict future rates of disability progression. In MS-DSS, the disability measurement by insensitive, discrete EDSS is replaced by a much more sensitive, statistical learning optimized continuous disability scale, Combinatorial Weight-Adjusted Disability Scale [CombiWISE (36) ]. Additionally, disability ratings in MS-DSS are adjusted for patient-specific treatments using mathematical models derived from previously published meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments of MS (37) . Finally, the MS-DSS model also contains certain demographic data and a Composite MRI Scale of CNS tissue destruction [COMRIS-CTD (38) ].

Demonstration that related B cell clones populate all CNS compartments in MS, including CSF (39), validates the evaluation of CSF B cells as a representative population. The strength of our study resides in the application of highly standardized protocols in a blinded fashion to a sizable number of MS patients and controls prospectively collected at a single institution. Critically, we also validated most important new findings in prospectively acquired, independent validation cohort. We consider application of different methodology in the validation cohort (i.e., ELISA as opposed to ICCS) also a strength of this study, because it demonstrates that the data are independent of the methodological constraints of applied assays. Our initial hesitancy to use ELISA assay for answering question about differences in cellular phenotypes stem from the fact that in contrast to ICCS, which outputs values proportional to the concentration of cytokines in each cell, ELISA measures sum of the cytokines secreted by all living cells in the culture. Therefore, ELISA results are crucially dependent on the number of seeded cells and manual cell counts may introduce noise in the measurement. We successfully mitigated this problem by developing flow-cytometry based, objective normalization of imputed cell numbers among all studied subjects. This normalization was performed before unblinding the diagnostic categories.",

Nevertheless, CSF biomarkers have been established as viable proxies for inflammation originating from the CNS (40) and correlate with disease pathologies in MS (41, 42) . As we discussed before, analogous clonotypes of T and B cells were identified in CNS tissue and CSF of individual patients. In regard to EBV transformation, due to limited numbers of B cells in the human CSF irrespective of diagnostic categories studied (with exception of intrathecal B cell lymphoma, which was not studied here), no current technologies can provide functional information from ex vivo isolated CSF B cells. We cannot rule out a possibility that EBV transformation might have affected phenotype of derived BCL (43, 44) . However, blinding and written SOPs assured that any bias that EBV transformation and in vitro manipulation may have introduced affected all subjects equally. Therefore, this cannot explain the observed (and validated) differences among diagnostic categories. The obtained results to a large degree mitigate aforementioned concern, because our study reproduced a key finding from previously published ex vivo analyses of primary CSF B cells (7, 8) , such as significantly higher levels of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (but not CD86) in CSF BCL derived from MS patients in comparison to controls (22) and trend for lower production of IL-10 observed in peripheral blood B cells derived from MS patients in comparison to HV (34) .",

            "text": "There are important novel findings identified in the current study. First, we observed an almost five-fold higher efficiency of EBV transformation in MS patients compared to controls. While this may be partially driven by higher CSF pleiocytosis and higher proportion of CSF B cells in MS as compared to NIND patients and HV, this cannot be true for the OIND cohort, because OIND and MS subjects have similar proportions of CSF B cells (7, 8, 24) . Furthermore, we observed only a weak correlation between CSF pleiocytosis or CSF IgG index and transformation efficiency, indicating that factors other than a higher number/proportion of CSF B cells in the MS cohort must underlie the differences in transformation efficiency. Higher transformation efficiency cannot be caused by higher EBV seropositivity (15) , as we observed that all subjects on whom EBV serology data are available were seropositive (Table 1) . Thus, higher transformation efficiency in MS could be mechanistically linked to higher intrathecal EBV expression (12) previously reported in MS, or may result from a defect of cytolytic activity of CSF T cells toward EBV transformed B cells, as described for peripheral T cells in MS (45) . We consider the latter possibility less likely because use of cyclosporine A in our transformation protocol should limit the effect of cytotoxic T cells. The final possibility is that MS susceptibility genes enhance EBV infection of B cells and the rates of their immortalization. This hypothesis is consistent with both experimental data presented here and epidemiological data linking EBV to MS.",

            "text": "The second group of novel findings relate to MS-specific differences in cytokine phenotypes of intrathecal B cells. The first finding is rather surprising, the decrease in secretion of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 in the CSF B cells from RRMS subjects in comparison to all other diagnostic subgroups. This finding was observed only in the validation cohort because we have not studied IL-1\u03b2 secretion by ICCS in the pilot cohort. However, the level of statistical significance and congruency of findings against all control groups make this finding rather robust, even in the absence of independent validation. Increased IL-1\u03b2 secretion is a hallmark of genetic auto-inflammatory syndromes associated with the activation of the inflammasome, predominantly in the cells of innate immunity. IL-1\u03b2 secretion is regulated by caspases, especially by caspase-1, but IL-1\u03b2 secretion is unconventional in that it does not enter the classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi protein secretion pathway. Instead, its secretion requires formation of a new intracellular compartment, called Unconventional Protein Secretion (UPS) (46) , induced by stress such as the deprivation of nutrients (47) . Additionally, IL-1\u03b2 secretion is linked to autophagy, raising a possibility that the unique cytokine secretion phenotype of RRMS B cells may be linked to dysfunction in autophagy pathways, previously identified in immune cells of MS and its animal model Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) (48) . However, we must not forget that ELISA measures the difference between secretion and consumption and that IL-1\u03b2 is also consumed by B cells, especially of the regulatory phenotype (49) . Therefore, enhanced consumption of IL-1\u03b2 by B cells derived from RRMS patients, due to their higher proportion of regulatory B cells in the intrathecal compartment represents an emerging new hypothesis, testable in future studies. Intriguingly, IL-1\u03b2 production was highly correlated with the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 and these cytokines were not only expressed at higher levels in PMS but also correlated with MS severity measured by MS-DSS. In other words, patients with higher B cell secretion of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 (and GM-CSF) have more aggressive MS, characterized by faster accumulation of disability. Due to collinearity between these three cytokines, it is unclear whether each has an independent contribution to MS severity. We tried to answer this issue by exploring statistical learning using either generalized boosting machine or multiple linear regressions to assess whether a complex model that contains all three (or two) of these cytokines correlates better with MS-DSS than individual cytokines. None of these models performed better than IL-1\u03b2 alone (data not shown), suggesting that IL-1\u03b2 secretion has the dominant effect on MS severity. While correlation is not causation, our results generate the hypothesis for future studies that B cell secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and/or their decreased consumption of IL-1\u03b2 due to low proportion of regulatory B cells in the intrathecal compartment contributes to CNS tissue destruction in MS.",

We found and validated the enhanced production of VEGF, specifically the VEGF-C (but not VEGF-A) family member, in RRMS patients. VEGF-A binds to VEGF receptors 1 (VEGFR1; Flt-1) and\u22122 (VEGFR2; KDR/Flk-1), expressed predominantly in endothelial cells (50) . Not surprisingly, then, VEGF-A mediates the effects of VEGF on endothelial cells, stimulating angiogenesis, but also opening epithelial tight junctions, leading to vascular edema. In contrast, VEGF-C binds a third receptor (VEGFR3; Flt4), expressed on the cells of the lymphatic endothelium, and thus mediates lymphangiogenesis (50) . At this point, we can only speculate about functional consequences of enhanced VEGF-C secretion by RRMS B cells; it is possible that the lymphangiogenesis initiates the formation of lymphoid aggregates, also called tertiary lymphoid follicles, found in the meninges of patients with long-standing MS and being linked to more severe CNS tissue destruction (11) .",

            "text": "We also found (and validated) that, compared to RRMS patients' BCL, intrathecal B cells derived from PMS patients produced higher amounts of two closely related cytokines, LT-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1. In view of the VEGF-C findings described above, it is important to note that both LT-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 play an important role in the development and maintenance of tertiary lymphoid follicles (10, 11) . Thus, the major conclusion we can derive from our analysis of the functional phenotype of CSF B cells is that B cells derived from MS patients differ from B cells derived from non-MS controls, including those with inflammatory neurological diseases in their prolymphangiogenic potential. Why VEGF-C is upregulated only in B cells derived from the early, RRMS stage, and why B cells from PMS instead secrete higher concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 are intriguing topics for future investigation. Similar MSstage-specific differences were observed in peripheral blood for a subset of MS susceptibility genes, using expression profiling (52) . Specifically, previously reported MS susceptibility gene MYC (51) was upregulated in peripheral blood only in RRMS, but not PMS patients (52) . Even further, mice overexpressing MYC in B-cell progenitors had increased VEGF production and concurrent stimulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (53) . It is possible that MYC deregulation plays a causal role in the observed VEGF-C phenotype in RRMS, but not progressive patients. In contrast, PMS groups (but not RRMS patients) had significantly lower expression of TNFRSF1A (52) in blood leukocytes, suggesting that this is either a consequence of higher TNF-\u03b1 production in progressive MS (as part of negative feedback loop), or, alternatively, lower expression of the receptor may cause lower consumption of TNF-\u03b1 by immune cells derived from progressive MS. Clearly, expression or genes and translation of proteins can change with disease evolution, underlying processes such as terminal differentiation of memory B cells induced by chronic inflammation, as has been previously described for T cells in PMS but not RRMS (54) . Alternatively, the observed changes may have a causative role: e.g., patients with increased production of TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 may be predisposed to progressive disease. These two possibilities can be only addressed in longitudinal studies that will assess the rate of MS progression in RRMS subjects whose intrathecal B cells produce high or low levels of TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1.",
