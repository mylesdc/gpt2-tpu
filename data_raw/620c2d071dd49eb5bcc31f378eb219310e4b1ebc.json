            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a viral infection commonly occurring in children and infants, which produces flu-like symptoms and blisters [1] [2] [3] . HFMD is caused by enteroviruses [e.g., coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71 (EV71)] [4] [5] [6] . EV71 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family [7, 8] . Infection by EV71 in children is related to severe neurological, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. It has been suggested that disease severity is additionally affected by host factors, such as the host immune response [9] . The severity of EV71 infection has been found to be related to excessive and robust pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine responses and production [10] . The innate immune system affords defense against invading pathogens at an early phase of infection by recognizing various conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral RNAs, and acting to limit virus replication. RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors) [11] , TLRs (Toll-like receptors) [12] , and NOD-like receptors [13] are members of PRRs (pattern recognition receptors), which can recognize viral RNA and elicit downstream signal transduction to provoke the innate immune response. Innate immunity is utilized by the host to fight against foreign pathogens, and EV71 invasion triggers the RLR and TLR pathways to counter the duplication and spreading of the virus. RIG-I, an essential receptor that recognizes EV71 RNA, engages in cytokine production in the host. RIG-I releases the N-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) for interaction with an identical domain on the adaptor protein located on the outer membrane of mitochondria after it interacts with viral RNAs [14] , and consequently activates nuclear factor kappa B (NFjB) and interferon regulating factor 3/7 (IRF3/7). Phosphorylation of NFjB and IRF3/7 induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, interferon (IFN), and adhesion molecules against pathogen invasion. However, the hyperinduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by pathogen infection, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 (i.e., a cytokine storm), causes complications or even ultimately death as a result of these infections [15] .",

Previous reports demonstrated that miRs function in many pathological and biological processes, including inflammation and viral infection [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Micro-RNAs additionally play an essential role in EV71 infection and modulating viral replication and pathogenicity [23] [24] [25] . In our study, we found that EV71 infection downregulated the expression of miR-9. Ectopic expression of miR-9 with EV71 infection induced an RLR-triggered innate immune response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, miR-9 agomirs were able to limit EV71 replication by maintaining cytokines at a moderate level in different tissues in animal model. Notably, our data reveal that miR-9 significantly decreased EV71-induced excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through reducing expression and activation of NFjB. Given these results, our data demonstrate that miR-9 positively regulates inflammation elicited by EV71 and suppresses virus replication by targeting NFjB.",

Next, EV71-infected mice were utilized to examine miR-9 expression in vivo. The EV71 was injected into the abdomen of the mice, which were sacrificed either four or five days following appearance of severe posterior paralysis. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the virus mainly localized to the lung and muscle (Fig. 1C ). There were relatively low titers of EV71 in the spleen, brain, liver, and intestine. The expression level of miR-9 in different tissues was then examined. We observed a significant decrease in miR-9 expression in muscle, intestine, lung, and brain (Fig. 1D) .

Protein expression of both IRF3 and RIG-I in miR-9-mimicexpressing cells did not show a significant difference with nontransfected cells.

Consistent with these results, real-time PCR data suggested more efficient downregulation of NFjB was observed in RD cells treated with miR-9-mimic, while lower NFjB was detected in the miR-9-mimic-treated group, compared to the nontreated group (Fig. 5B) .

As shown in Fig. 7A , miR-9 was confirmed to be ectopically expressed by real-time PCR. Additionally, we found that VP1 expression was significantly reduced after miR-9 agomir administration, suggesting an antiviral effect of miR-9. Furthermore, the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines induced by EV71 were evaluated by real-time PCR experiment (Fig. 7B ). As shown in Fig. 7C ,D, robust expression of IL-1 and IFN-b was observed in muscle, lung, blood, and spleen tissues of EV71-infected mice. In contrast, the expression of these two cytokines was markedly inhibited with agomiR-9 treatment. Together, our data provide evidence that miR-9 confers an inhibitory effect on the EV71-induced cytokine storm and therefore ameliorates the damage caused by EV71.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that excessive inflammatory signaling occurring during organ injury is one of the main pathogenic factors responsible for high mortality following EV71 infection [26] [27] [28] . NFjB is a signaling pathway that regulates many genes related to cell differentiation, proliferation, and innate immune response. In addition, via eliciting pro-inflammatory cytokine and type I IFN (IFN-b and IFN-a) expression, NFjB is important in the antiviral reactions of the host [29] [30] [31] . However, the 2C protein of EV71 suppresses NFjB activation, which increases the virus replication. Viral protein 2C suppresses the phosphorylation of IjBa and IKKb via binding with their kinase domains, reducing NFjB activation, and promoting viral replication The luciferase activity of the luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type or mutated 3 0 -UTR of human NFjB after miR-9-mimic transfection in several cell lines. The luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of b-galactosidase. miR-9 overexpression significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity in the wild-type 3 0 -UTR, but not mutant 3 0 -UTR of NFjB mRNA. (C and D) Western blotting and real-time PCR analysis were performed to determine the levels of NFjB protein and mRNA after miR-9-mimic transfection or control. These assays have been performed three times. Data represent means AE SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. The statistical test performed using Student's t-test. 7 . Effect of miR-9 on EV71 replication and pathogenicity in mice. Mice were inoculated with EV71 or PBS as a negative control. Mice were then treated with miR-9 agomir. (A) Mice from the EV71 group and the NC group were sacrificed on day 4 or 5 postinoculation to determine miR-9 expression in different tissues of mice. Expression levels of VP1 (B), IL-1 (C), and IFN-b (D) in different tissues of EV71infected mice were examined using real-time PCR. These assays have been performed three times. Data represent means AE SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. The statistical test performed using Student's t-test. [32]. In our study, miR-9 administration resulted in deactivation and expression of NFjB while inhibiting EV71 replication. These results could be attributed to the robust pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are believed to contribute to EV71 pathogenicity, which were ameliorated by miR-9 expression, indicating that a moderate level of cytokines and interferon was maintained to limit the effect of EV71. However, the molecular mechanisms by which miR-9 controls VP1 expression and viral replication during EV71 infection still need further research to investigate the possibility of whether miR-9 inhibits inflammation and EV71 propagation separately.",

            "text": "The practical implication of miR-9 in evolution is suggested by its sequence conservation at the nucleotide level in different species rather than its varying expression patterns. Although the sequence of miR-9 is conserved, its expression profile differs significantly in various species. miR-9 is being extensively investigated in various biological processes: NPC proliferation and migration [33] , neuronal differentiation [34] , apoptotic cell death [35] , brain function and neurodegeneration [36] , and cancer [37] . Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that miR-9 is required for replication of multiple of viruses. Dong et al. [38] indicated a novel function of miR-9 in influenza A virus infection and found that the influenza virus might hijack endogenous miR-9 for the viral life cycle. Tatro et al. [39] suggested that HIV infection induced elevated expression of miR-9, causing suppression of splice variants of KCNMA1, which may affect the release of neurotransmitters. Lai et al. reported that the nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus OC43 causes activation of NFjB. This activation was the consequence of the nucleocapsid binding to RNA, specifically miR-9 (a negative NFjB modulator), as was found in this study [40] . Our study suggests that miR-9 is a negative mediator for EV71 replication in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR-9 in cells resulted in inactivation of NFjB and ameliorated the excessive cytokine production, potentially lessening the organ injury induced by the cytokine storm during virus infection.",
