Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide since the late 1980s. In this study, we found that infection of PRRSV strain WUH3 (genotype 2 PRRSV) induced stable formation of robust SGs in MARC-145 cells, as demonstrated by the recruitment of marker proteins of SGs, including TIA1, G3BP1, and eIF3\u03b7. Treatment with specific inhibitors or siRNAs against the stress kinases that are involved in SG formation revealed that PRRSV induced SG formation through a PERK (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase)-dependent mechanism. Impairment of SG assembly by concomitant knockdown of the SG marker proteins (TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR) did not affect PRRSV growth, while significantly enhanced PRRSV-induced NF-\u03baB subunit p65 phosphorylation and inflammatory cytokine production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRRSV induces SG formation via a PERK-dependent pathway and that SGs are involved in the signaling pathway of the PRRSV-induced inflammatory response in MARC-145 cells.",

            "text": "Stress granules (SGs) are discrete cytoplasmic protein-RNA structures that are quickly assembled in eukaryotic cells when the cells are exposed to various stresses, including heat shock, starvation, oxidation, ultraviolet irradiation, hypoxia, and viral infection (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009) . Four stress kinases have been identified that are involved in the SG formation when cells are exposed to distinct types of stresses: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) senses dsRNA during viral infection; protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) detects unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) monitors changes in heme levels; and general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2) senses amino acid starvation, ultraviolet damage, and viral infection (Yamasaki and Anderson, 2008) . Activation of any of these kinases leads to the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which inhibits the exchange of eIF2-GDP for eIF2-GTP. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 decreases the level of the active eIF2/tRNAiMet/GTP ternary complex, leading to the reversible inhibition of translation initiation and consequent polysome disassembly with a corresponding accumulation of the stalled 43S and 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes (Mazroui et al., 2006) . These complexes then recruit multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T-cell internal antigen 1 (TIA1), TIA1-related protein (TIAR), and many others, to nucleate SG assembly (Reineke and Lloyd, 2013) . In addition to the most common SG assembly pathway described above, SGs can also be induced by eIF2\u03b1-independent mechanisms via the inactivation of translation factors (eIF4A or eIF4G) or the overexpression of SG components, such as TIA1 and G3BP1 (Kedersha et al., 2000; Tourriere et al., 2003) . Although many pathways can result in SG or SG-like structure formations, the canonical SGs are defined by the presence of key translation initiation factors, mRNA and the small ribosome subunit (Dinh et al., 2013; Reineke and Lloyd, 2013) . Viral infection can certainly be viewed as a source of stress for cells, and several viruses have been studied to monitor their effect on the host stress response, especially how viruses modulate SG assembly. Many viruses have been reported to inhibit SG accumulation, such as Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) (Legros et al., 2011) , Rotavirus (Montero et al., 2008) , Influenza A virus (IAV) (Khaperskyy et al., 2012) , Mengovirus, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Borghese and Michiels, 2011) . In contrast, several viruses, such as Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), induce the stable formation of SGs (Lindquist et al., 2010) . Furthermore, transient SG formation is observed during the infection by some viruses, such as Encephalomyocarditis virus , Poliovirus (White et al., 2007) , Coxsackievirus type B3 (CVB3) (Fung et al., 2013) , and Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) (Qin et al., 2011) . Growing evidence suggests that SGs, or at least SG components, may potentially function to repress productive viral infections. The propagation of some viruses, such as Measles virus (Okonski and Samuel, 2013) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Katoh et al., 2013) , Poliovirus (White et al., 2007) , Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Dinh et al., 2013) , Mengovirus, and TMEV (Borghese and Michiels, 2011) , can be impaired by SGs or their components. In the case of IAV, mutant IAV that lacks nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), but not wild-type IAV, efficiently generates SGs containing retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) together with viral RNA and antiviral proteins. Inhibition of these SGs results in an enhancement of IAV replication (Onomoto et al., 2012) . Conversely, several viruses have been reported to benefit from SG formation. For example, RSV replication was impaired in cells with a reduced level of G3BP1 expression (Lindquist et al., 2010) . Currently, the interplay between PRRSV replication and the cellular stress response remains largely unclear.",

Because the formation of SGs is kinetic, five time points (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) after PRRSV infection were examined. Cells treated with the potent SG-inducer, sodium arsenite (SA), and mock-infected cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Monoclonal antibody specific for PRRSV N was used to detect PRRSV-infected cells. As expected, more than 95% of SA-treated cells contained SGs, while no obvious SGs were observed in mock-infected cells, which is consistent with findings from a previous report (McEwen et al., 2005) . In PRRSV-infected cells, cytoplasmic granules containing SG marker proteins TIA1 or G3BP1 were not seen at 6 h post-infection (hpi) (data not shown), but they began to occur at 12 hpi and still existed at 48 hpi (Figures 1A,B) . Based on the number of PRRSV-infected cells containing SGs, PRRSV triggered the formation of SGs in approximately 10% of cells at 12 hpi, 50% of cells at 24 hpi, and 90% of cells at 36 and 48 hpi ( Figure 1C) . These results suggest that a robust SG response was induced by PRRSV beginning at approximately 12 h after inoculation and maintained during the course of PRRSV infection.",

Considering that (i) canonical SGs contain translation initiation factors (such as eIF3\u03b7) and (ii) the results above revealed that G3BP1 was recruited to the PRRSV-SGs, goat antibodies against eIF3\u03b7 were used to visualize the canonical SGs, rabbit antibodies against G3BP1 were used to visualize PRRSV-SGs, and mouse antibodies against PRRSV N protein were used to visualize the infected cells. We found that, early in infection (12 and 24 hpi), hardly any eIF3\u03b7 foci were observed ( Figure 2B , the third and fourth rows, respectively). Interestingly, at later times in infection (36 and 48 hpi), the amount of eIF3\u03b7 foci was almost as high as that of G3BP1 foci, and both proteins were recruited to the same granules in the PRRSV-infected cells ( Figure 2B , the fifth and bottom rows, respectively), which is similar to SAinduced SGs ( Figure 2B , the second row). Taken together, these results indicate that the composition of PRRSV-induced SGs is the same as that of canonical SGs. However, the reason why eIF3 is recruited to PRRSV-induced SGs late in infection rather than early, like G3BP1, remains a question for further study.",

To assess whether SGs is associated with PRRSV growth, we tried to impair SG formation through concomitant knockdown of TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR. Firstly, specific siRNAs were designed to knock down the endogenous TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR, respectively. The knockdown efficiency was demonstrated by the results of realtime RT-qPCR and Western blot assays ( Figure 4A) . The specific siRNAs targeting TIA1, G3BP1 or TIAR were transfected into MARC-145 cells concomitantly, followed by PRRSV infection or SA treatment. Then SG assembly was monitored upon immunostaining of SG component eIF3\u03b7. In line with previous study (Bley et al., 2015) , the concomitant depletion of all three proteins by siS, led to substantial SG disassembly in cells treated with SA ( Figure 4B) . Similar results could be observed in PRRSVinfected cells, indicating that SG assembly induced by PRRSV was aborted sharply when all three proteins, TIA1, G3BP1 and TIAR, were silenced together ( Figure 4C , the bottom row). Besides, these cells were also fixed and stained with antibodies against TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR, respectively, to confirm the efficient knockdown of each protein using indirect immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 4C ). Then cells were transfected concomitantly with TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1-specific siRNAs, prior to PRRSV infection, and harvested together with the supernatants at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi, and plaque assays were performed to assess their titers.

Interstitial pneumonia is considered one of the most remarkable features of PRRSV infection (Duan et al., 2014) , and a large number of studies have reported that PRRSV infection induces inflammatory cytokine production in vivo and in vitro (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2012) . To investigate if SGs have a biological impact on PRRSV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, MARC-145 cells were transfected simultaneously with TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1-specific siRNAs prior to PRRSV infection. Then the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected by real-time RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 5A , the IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression levels in the concomitant depletion cells were increased to varying degrees compared with those for the negative control-transfected cells.",

At least four distinct patterns of SG formation have been reported following infection with RNA or DNA viruses: stable, transient, oscillating, or no SG formation (Onomoto et al., 2014) . For example, RSV triggers stable SG formation throughout the viral life cycle (Lindquist et al., 2010 (Lindquist et al., , 2011 , while poliovirus infection causes a transient SG formation during the early phase of infection, but disperses the resulting SGs by cleavage of G3BP1 during later stages of infection (White et al., 2007) . The levels of growth arrest DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34) and the phosphorylated form of eIF2\u03b1 contribute to the oscillating SG formation in hepatitis C virus-infected cells (Ruggieri et al., 2012) . In contrast, Mengovirus, TMEV (Borghese and Michiels, 2011) , Herpes simplex virus (Khong and Jan, 2011) , and Influenza virus (Khaperskyy et al., 2012) all restrict SG accumulation. In our present study, we found that PRRSV induces SG formation within 12 h of inoculation and that the frequency of SGs increases as the infection progresses, indicating that PRRSV specifically initiates and maintains the stress response in MARC-145 cells. Previous studies showed that the infection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), both viruses belong to Nidovirales order as PRRSV, could also induce SG formation (Raaben et al., 2007; Sola et al., 2011) . Whether it is a common feature of Nidovirales viruses to induce SGs requires future works.",

Abundant evidence indicates that several viruses commonly induce SG formation via the activation of PKR, or in some cases, via the activation of GCN2 (Berlanga et al., 2006; Lindquist et al., 2011; Okonski and Samuel, 2013) , while other viruses block SG formation by preventing PKR activation, such as IAV (Khaperskyy et al., 2012) and West Nile virus (Courtney et al., 2012) . Alternately, some viruses induce SG assembly, but the formation of SGs is abolished by PKR deficiency, such as hepatitis C virus (Garaigorta et al., 2012) and RSV (Lindquist et al., 2011) . In the case of MRV, more than one eIF2\u03b1 kinase is required for the induction of SGs (Qin et al., 2009) . The results of our study demonstrate that inhibition of PERK, but not of PKR, HRI, or GCN2, completely abrogates SG formation and decreases the eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation level in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating that PERK is responsible for PRRSV-induced SG formation. Indeed, previous studies of other research groups had showed that PRRSV infection upregulated phosphorylation level of PERK (Huo et al., 2013) and the phosphorylation level of PKR was not well correlated with that of eIF2\u03b1 in MARC-145 cells (Wang et al., 2016) . Furthermore, knockdown of PKR using specific siRNA had no significant effect on PRRSV-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Wang et al., 2016) . These results suggested that PKR is not responsible for PRRSVinduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent SG formation, which is consistent with our conclusion. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle structure responsible for protein synthesis (Berridge, 2002) , and ER stress reduces the rates of protein translation initiation. As described above, translation arrest results in the formation of SGs (Kedersha and Anderson, 2002; Anderson and Kedersha, 2008) . A previous study showed that PRRSV infection leads to an ER stress response, which, in turn, induces activation of PERK and the subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in MARC-145 cells (Huo et al., 2013) . Thus, it is possible that there is a connection between the induction of SGs by PRRSV infection and the ER stress response.",

For example, expression of a cleavage-resistant G3BP1 restored SG formation during poliovirus infection and significantly inhibited virus replication (White et al., 2007) . Similarly, depletion of TIA1 resulted in enhanced VSV growth and gene expression (Dinh et al., 2013) . Conversely, RSV induces host SG formation to facilitate viral replication (Lindquist et al., 2010) . Here, we found that, like RSV, PRRSV induces stable SG formation; however, unlike in RSV, impairment of SG formation almost had no influence on the replication of PRRSV. Similar results were FIGURE 5 | Role of SGs in the PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses. (A) MARC-145 cells were simultaneously transfected with siTIA1, siG3BP1, and siTIAR for 24 h, and cells were then mock-infected or infected with PRRSV. Cytokine mRNA levels (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) were evaluated using real-time RT-qPCR assays at 36 hpi. ***P < 0.01, comparison between cells transfected with NC siRNA and specific siRNA followed by PRRSV infection. (B) MARC-145 cells are treated as described for (A). At 36 hpi, the levels of p65 phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blotting. The ratio of phosphorylated/total p65 was analyzed using ImageJ Software.",

Many signaling proteins are sequestered by SGs and/or affect their assembly, which alter diverse signaling pathways (Kedersha et al., 2013) . In our study, we found that the SGs are involved in the signaling pathway for the PRRSV-induced inflammatory response. In PRRSV-infected cells, impairment of SG formation by the concomitant knockdown of three SG components (TIA1, TIAR, and G3BP1) increased the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 concomitant with an increased phosphorylation level of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit. Interstitial pneumonia is the most remarkable characteristic of PRRSV infection, suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in the infection and pathogenesis induced by PRRSV. Inflammation is also a two-edged sword for the host. Impairment of SG assembly enhanced the expression of PRRSVinduced inflammatory cytokines to some extent, indicating that SGs may be a host defense factor against the PRRSV-induced inflammatory response, even though it is not involved in PRRSV replication.",
