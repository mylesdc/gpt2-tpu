To stimulate hemagglutination (HA) of A/Swine/Guangdong/LM/2004 (H1N1) (SW/GD/04) antibody response, eukaryotic expression plasmid pCI-neo-HA was constructed and used as an immunogen to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Five mAbs (designed 8C4, 8C6, 9D6, 8A4, and 8B1) against HA protein were obtained and characterized. Western blot showed that the 70 kDa HA protein could be detected by all mAbs in MDCK cells infected with SW/GD/04. Three mAbs-8C4, 8C6, and 9D6-have hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization test (NT) activities, and 8C6 induces the highest HI and NT titers. The protection efficacy of 8C6 was investigated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of the H1 subtype SIV. The results indicate that mAb 8C6 protected the mice from viral infections, especially the homologous strain, which was clearly demonstrated by the body weight changes and reduction of viral load. Thus, our findings document for the first time that mAb 8C6 might be of potential therapeutic value for H1 subtype SIV infection.",

            "text": "Pigs, which serve as 'mixing vessels' because of their susceptibility to infection by both human and avian influenza viruses, may be a pandemic threat to public health [10] . Sporadic human infection with the Eurasian H1N1 SIV has emerged in Europe and China [11] [12] [13] . Vaccination is a primary and effective measure for controlling SIV infection [14, 15] , but it might have some restrictions. For example, vaccinations may not be effective in preventing against diverse viral strains, manifesting as less immunogenic, or acting with inadequate speed, to combat newly-emerging seasonal or potentially pandemic strains [16] . Other approaches, including viral culture in mammalian or insect cells, have been suggested to produce pandemic or seasonal influenza vaccines [17, 18] , but the low levels of expressed proteins, or the unknown risks of antigens in cells, are obstacles in combating pandemics [19] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an alternative rapid measure to cope with the requests of a pandemic [20] . For example, passive immunization by delivering specific antibodies to a recipient could protect animals from infection [21] . Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against virus function either by inhibiting virus attachment to, or membrane fusion with, the susceptible cells [22] . Studies have proved that mAbs could be used as an effective and preventive treatment against influenza virus infection [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, until now, there are no effective neutralizing mAbs available in preventing or controlling H1N1 SIV infection.",

Traditional protein-based immunization has difficulty in generating mAbs against conformation-sensitive targets. DNA-based immunization can solve these problems because native proteins can be expressed in vivo when they are delivered in the form of DNA as an immunogen, which does not require the process of protein production or purification. Furthermore, the correct conformation of proteins is critical for the induction of functional active antibodies, yet these sensitive structures tend to be damaged during the in vitro protein production process. Expressing intact immunogens in vivo by DNA-based immunization appears to be the best approach for inducing mAbs with the desired biological activities [31] . Herein, a eukaryotic expression plasmid (pCI-neo-HA) was constructed and used as the immunogen to prepare mAbs against hemagglutination (HA) protein of H1 subtype swine virus. We prepared and characterized five mAbs and then evaluated 8C6 protective efficacy in mice against infection with homologous and heterologous H1 subtype viruses.",

Since mAb 8C6 has the highest HI and NT titers, we examined the protective efficacy in mice by challenging homologous and heterologous strains of H1N1 SIV (SW/GD/04 and SW/HRB/09). Considering H1N1 SIV isolates were not lethal to mice, we investigated the mAb protection efficacy by body weights and detectable virus titers from lungs, spleen, kidney, and nasal turbinates three days after challenge. These data confirm that one-dose pretreatment of mice with mAb 8C6 is sufficient to provide complete protection against homologous SW/GD/04 H1N1 SIV infection.",

Compared with normal control mice, the replication of the challenge virus in the mAb-treated mice was also inhibited in the lungs and nasal turbinates. These results demonstrate that the treatment of mice with mAb 8C6 also limits the susceptibility of the mice to infection with H1N1 SIV including the HA gene of a recent EA-lineage virus, suggesting that broad cross-protection might be conferred against the pandemic 2009/H1N1 virus. These results suggest that mAb 8C6 could provide a complete protection against the homolog and inhibit disease development caused by heterologous H1N1. The mAb 8C6 is, therefore, a promising treatment for H1 swine influenza virus infection.",
