            "text": "Recent reports indicate that the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) depends on the GBF1-Arf1-COP-I pathway. We generated Huh-7-derived cell lines resistant to brefeldin A (BFA), which is an inhibitor of this pathway. The resistant cell lines could be sorted into two phenotypes regarding BFA-induced toxicity, inhibition of albumin secretion, and inhibition of HCV infection. Two cell lines were more than 100 times more resistant to BFA than the parental Huh-7 cells in these 3 assays. This resistant phenotype was correlated with the presence of a point mutation in the Sec7 domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA. Surprisingly, the morphology of the cis-Golgi of these cells remained sensitive to BFA at concentrations of the drug that allowed albumin secretion, indicating a dichotomy between the phenotypes of secretion and Golgi morphology. Cells of the second group were about 10 times more resistant than parental Huh-7 cells to the BFAinduced toxicity. The EC 50 for albumin secretion was only 1.5-1.8 fold higher in these cells than in Huh-7 cells. However their level of secretion in the presence of inhibitory doses of BFA was 5 to 15 times higher. Despite this partially effective secretory pathway in the presence of BFA, the HCV infection was almost as sensitive to BFA as in Huh-7 cells. This suggests that the function of GBF1 in HCV replication does not simply reflect its role of regulator of the secretory pathway of the host cell. Thus, our results confirm the involvement of GBF1 in HCV replication, and suggest that GBF1 might fulfill another function, in addition to the regulation of the secretory pathway, during HCV replication.",

For the hepatitis C virus (HCV) these membrane rearrangements have been named membranous web. Different types of HCV-induced membrane structures have been observed depending on the experimental model. The membranous web was initially described in U-2 OS cells inducibly expressing the HCV polyprotein [1] , indicating that its formation depends on HCV protein expression, even without RNA replication. It was composed of small vesicles embedded in a membrane matrix. Similar membrane alterations were later observed in Huh-7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon of genotype 1b [2] and in JFH1-infected Huh-7 cells [3] . In replicon-containing cells, it was reported to contain the nonstructural proteins NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B, and the genomic RNA [2] . Moreover, newly synthesized viral RNA was also detected in the membranous web, clearly indicating that it is a site of viral RNA synthesis [2] .",

This second type of replicase was made of smaller structures much more mobile than the membranous web, and scattered throughout the cell [4] . In highly permissive Huh-7.5 cells replicating a subgenomic replicon of the JFH1 strain at high levels, the membrane alterations were shown to be much more extensive, with the occurrence of numerous double membrane vesicles and of multivesicular structures [5] that had not been observed before with replicons of genotype 1b. These double membrane vesicles, together with single membrane vesicles were also observed in JFH1-infected Huh-7.5 or Lunet cells [6, 7] . It is unclear whether the difference of morphological alterations observed in these various studies primarily results from the host cell, the viral genotype or both.",

Two viral proteins, NS4B and NS5A, appear to play a major role in the induction of membrane rearrangements [1, 6] . Based on morphological data showing a close association between the ER and the HCV replicases [1, [4] [5] [6] 8] , and on biochemical data indicating that HCV RNA replication takes place in a compartment that sustains endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycosylation [9] , the membranous web was proposed to be derived from the ER membrane. However, several endosomal markers were also observed colocalizing with HCV replicases and/or functionally involved in RNA replication [6, [10] [11] [12] . One major host factor implicated in HCV RNA replication is the phosphatidyl-inositol-4 kinase-IIIa (PI4KIIIa, also known as PI4KA) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , an enzyme of the ER, which interacts with, and is activated by NS5A during HCV replication [16] [17] [18] . Its depletion by RNA interference leads to morphologically aberrant NS5A-positive structures in cells expressing the HCV polyprotein [6, 12, 18] .",

            "text": "Recently, we and others found a role for the GBF1-Arf1-COP-I pathway in HCV replication [12, [19] [20] [21] . GBF1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is recruited to the membrane of the cis-Golgi and activates the G-protein Arf1. Once activated by the binding of GTP, Arf1 in turn recruits different effectors, including the coat protein complex COP-I, which then forms vesicular carriers. This pathway mediates the retrograde transport from the cis-Golgi and the ERGIC to the ER [22, 23] , and is also implicated in the biogenesis of lipid droplets [24] [25] [26] . Its inhibition by brefeldin A induces the collapse of the Golgi complex, the redistribution of Golgi glycosidases to the ER, and the block of the secretory pathway at the level of the ER exit. The precise role of this pathway in HCV replication is still unclear. Several other single-stranded positive RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae families also rely on this pathway for their replication [27] [28] [29] . The inhibition of HCV replication by brefeldin A is much stronger at the beginning of the infection than when the infection is already established [19] , suggesting a crucial role at the onset of replication. The other GBF1-dependent RNA viruses, which do not establish chronic infections unlike HCV, do not share this special requirement for GBF1 early during infection. GBF1 does not appear to be a component of HCV replication complexes, because it did not co-localize with NS5A, a marker of HCV replication complexes, in confocal microscopy. The formation of membranous web-like structures in U-2 OS cells expressing the HCV polyprotein was not inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting a role of the GBF1-Arf1-COP-I pathway in the functioning of the replication complexes rather than in their formation. Similarly, GBF1 does not seem to be required for the formation of membranous replication complexes of other singlestranded positive RNA viruses, such as poliovirus [27] , and mouse hepatitis virus [28] .",

As previously reported [19] , HCVcc infection in Huh-7 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, the lowest inhibitory concentration of BFA being 0.1 mg/ml (figure 2). Similar inhibitory patterns were observed in cells of group 2. Although the relative HCV infection was slightly higher in resistant cells of this group than in control Huh-7 cells with the doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml BFA, the EC 50 were very similar for the R3 to R6 cell lines (in the range of 0.03-0.06 mg/ml) and for Huh-7 cells (<0.04 mg/ml). Only R7 cells appeared slightly more resistant to HCV infection with an EC 50 of <0.3 mg/ml. In contrast, HCVcc infection was much less susceptible to BFA in R1 and R2 cells, in which a partial inhibition of HCV infection was only observed with a concentration of 10 mg/ml (figure 2). Therefore, the resistant cells displayed dramatically different sensitivity to BFA with regard to HCVcc infection, group 1 cells being resistant to BFA inhibition of HCV infection, and group 2 cells sensitivity being very similar to that of Huh-7 cells.",

Therefore, the resistance of HCV infection to BFA inhibition in R1 and R2 cells could have resulted from a shift of Arf-GEF usage from GBF1 to another BFA-insensitive Arf-GEF during HCV replication. To confirm that HCV infection in R1 and R2 cells was still dependent on GBF1, we performed siRNA-mediated depletion of GBF1 and analyzed the impact on HCV infection by quantifying NS5A expression. As previously reported [19] , a reduction of about 70-80% of GBF1 expression induced an inhibition of HCV infection of about 50% in Huh-7 cells (figure 3A). The depletion of BIG1, another BFA-sensitive Arf-GEF not involved in HCV replication [19] , only had a slight, nonsignificant effect, as compared to the untransfected control, whereas the depletion of the PI4KIIIa, a host factor essential for HCV replication, inhibited NS5A expression by about 80% in the same experimental setting (figure 3A). The levels of inhibition imposed by GBF1, BIG1 or PI4KIIIa depletions were very similar in Huh-7, R1 and R2 cells (figure 3B).

These mutations led to amino-acid substitutions at positions 547, 1396, 1725, and 1833 of the coding sequence of GBF1 isoform 3 (table 2). All these mutations were present together with the wild type sequence (data not shown), suggesting that only one copy of the gene was mutated. One of these mutations changes the residue of tyrosine 547 for an asparagine in the HUS domain, the function of which is unknown [43] . The mutated Y547N residue is located two residues away from the highly conserved ''HUS box'', which is the most highly conserved region of GBF/BIG GEFs outside of the Sec7 domain [43] . The three other mutations lie in nonconserved interdomain regions. The same set of mutations was found in Huh-7 cells and in cells from group 2 cells (data not shown). We therefore conclude that none of these mutations could account for the moderate resistance to BFA of these cells.",

The EC 50 was 12 ng/ml for Huh-7 cells, in the range of 200-300 ng/ml for R1 and R2 cells, and 8.5 mg/ml for MDCK cells ( figure S2 and  table 3) .

The M832 residue is part of the BFA binding site at the Sec7-Arf interface. Crystal structures of the complex between the Sec7 domain, BFA and Arf-GDP have been reported for Sec7 domains of a modified, BFA-sensitive Arno [44] , and of the yeast GBF1 homolog Gea1 [45] . In both crystal structures, the conserved methionine residue corresponding to M832 of GBF1 engages van der Waals contacts with BFA. Its substitution to a leucine residue has been reported to render GBF1 resistant to BFA in a dominant manner [38, 46] . Accordingly, expressing a GBF1-M832L construct in Huh-7 cells resulted in a phenotype of increased resistance to both BFA-induced toxicity and inhibition of HSA secretion. Moreover, we previously showed that the expression of GBF1-M832L renders Huh-7 cells resistant to the BFA-induced inhibition of HCV infection [19] .

The resistance to BFA-induced toxicity was only slightly increased, and could result from increased compensatory mechanisms in selected cells such as a reduced induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and/or of UPR-induced apoptosis in response to BFA [47] . The unusual pattern of inhibition of albumin secretion in the presence of increasing doses of BFA again suggests the existence of compensatory mechanisms, allowing the secretory pathway of these cells to be partially functional at concentrations of BFA that are fully inhibitory for Huh-7 cells. The nature of these putative compensatory mechanisms must await further studies. Surprisingly, although the secretory pathway of R1 and R2 cells was functional, we consistently observed at BFA concentrations comprised between 1 and 10 mg/ml a disruption of their cis-Golgi that appeared very similar to what was observed in BFA-sensitive Huh-7 cells. This indicates that the secretory pathway of cells with a BFA-resistant GBF1 is functional in the presence of BFA, in spite of a dramatically disorganized Golgi complex morphology, including the scattering of the cis-Golgi and the collapse of the trans-Golgi network. Our results clearly indicate a dichotomy between BFA impacts on the cis-Golgi scattering and the inhibition of HSA secretion. Even in parental, BFA-sensitive Huh-7 cells, the two effects of BFA were observed at different concentrations. Interestingly, no clear correlation between Golgi morphology and functional secretion was also found in a recent siRNA screen of regulators of Golgi architecture [48] . As previously reported [49] , the scattering of the cis-Golgi marker was also observed after siRNA-mediated depletion of GBF1. This is consistent with a role of GBF1 in the regulation of the Golgi morphology, as reported previously [50, 51] . Nonetheless, the sensitivity of the Golgi morphology to BFA in R1 and R2 cells with a BFA-resistant GBF1 due to the M832L mutation was more puzzling, especially since MDCK cells, which also have a leucine residue instead of a methionine at position 832 of GBF1, did not appear to have a Golgi morphology sensitive to BFA in the same experimental conditions. However, we found that the morphology of the cis-Golgi of MDCK cells is also sensitive to BFA to some extent. This suggests that the M832L mutation reduces but does not completely abolish the binding of BFA to GBF1. This is consistent with the observation that BFA engages contacts with other residues of the binding site of GBF1 [38, 46] .",

We cannot exclude the possibility that differences between the sequences of the proteins of dog and human origin could also contribute to this difference of sensitivity.

            "text": "The precise function of GBF1 during HCV replication is still elusive. GBF1 has been reported to be involved in the replication of several positive RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae families [19, [27] [28] [29] . For all these viruses, the replication of the genomic RNA takes place in vesicular, rearranged membranes originating, at least in part, from membranes of the early secretory pathway. However, for all these families of viruses, GBF1, which is a major regulator of the early secretory pathway, appears to have no major role in the formation of the rearranged membranes of infected cells, but rather be involved in the functioning of these structures [19, 27, 28] . We previously hypothesized that GBF1-associated mechanisms might function to deliver proteins or lipids to HCV replication complexes [19] . Our results with the cells of group 2 suggest that the role of GBF1 in HCV replication does not simply reflect its role as a regulator of the protein secretory pathway. Indeed, the pattern of BFA inhibition of HSA secretion does not match the one of HCV infection in these cell lines. HCV infection is completely inhibited by 1 mg/ml BFA, whereas HSA secretion occurs at a rate comprised between 18 and 44% of its secretion in the absence of BFA. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist in these cells that allow HSA to be transported out of the ER in the presence of BFA, since this is the main step of the secretory pathway that is inhibited by BFA. However these compensatory mechanisms do not support the replication of HCV, even at a reduced rate. This suggests that GBF1 function during HCV replication does not only reflect the functioning of the secretory pathway, but it could also fulfill an additional function during HCV replication. This additional function could be either related to another cellular function of GBF1, or GBF1 could be, at least in part, diverted from its normal cellular functions during HCV infection. It is worth noting that the inhibition of poliovirus replication by BFA can be largely rescued by expression of only the N-terminus of GBF1, not including the catalytic Sec7 domain [53] . This indicates the existence of a GBF1 function unrelated to Arf1 activation during poliovirus replication. It would be interesting to determine whether a similar situation could be observed with HCV. We and others have shown that Arf1 is required for HCV replication. However, this does not preclude the existence of an additional GBF1 function unrelated to Arf1 activation during HCV replication. It would be interesting to determine whether GBF1 mutants that do not localize to the Golgi could rescue an infection inhibited by BFA or by GBF1 depletion. In addition to GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2 have been suggested to be involved in the replication of poliovirus [54] . The absence of inhibition of HCV infection by BFA in R1 and R2 cells strongly suggests that GBF1 is the only BFA-sensitive factor required for HCV infection. This indicates that BIG1 and BIG2 are not required for HCV entry or replication.",

The formation of PI4P by PI4KIIIb in infected cells has been shown to be essential for the replication of several positive RNA viruses [55] . For HCV, several groups have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of PI4KIIIa in HCV replication [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In contrast, the function of PI4KIIIb in HCV replication is still controversial [15, 16, 18] . It has been shown that NS5A is a critical inducer of PI4P formation through its interaction and activation of PI4KIIIa [16, 18] . Whether GBF1 and Arf1 contribute to this process is still unknown. It was recently reported that the PI4P produced by PI4KIIIamodulates the recruitment of GBF1 by rab1b to the Golgi membrane [56] .",

It is not yet known if these host factors regulate the formation or the functioning of the membranous web, and if their function is related to the one of GBF1 during HCV replication. However it is striking that rab1b is a GBF1-binding partner, which modulates its function in the secretory pathway of non-infected cells [60] . Therefore, even though the function of GBF1 in HCV replication appears to be different from its role of regulator of the secretory pathway, it is tempting to speculate that the virus subverts the whole rab1-GBF1-Arf1-COP-I pathway, normally devoted to the regulation of membrane dynamics in the secretory pathway, for the functioning of the membranous web.
