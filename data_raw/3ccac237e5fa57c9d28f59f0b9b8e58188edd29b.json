Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export. Information gained from this virus-host interaction improves the understanding of both the IAV replication cycle and the cellular function of DDX19.",

In particular, a growing list of RNA viruses were found to co-opt DDX proteins to support various steps of their life cycle. For instance, the HIV-1 Rev protein associates with DDX3, which together with DDX1 promotes the Rev-dependent nuclear export of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNAs 4 . Although the HCV genome encodes a viral RNA helicase, DDX3, DDX1 and DDX6 are required for efficient HCV genomic RNA replication 5 . The DDX1 protein was shown to interact with the Nsp14 exonuclease of coronaviruses and to facilitate their replication 6 . The DDX proteins may also be involved at later stages of viral infection, as exemplified by the role of DDX24 in the packaging of HIV-1 RNA during virus assembly 7 or the role of DDX56 in the assembly of West Nile virus particles 8 . In addition several DDX helicases have been involved in anti-viral innate immunity, mostly as sensors. This is notably the case for DDX58, also named RIG-I, but also for DDX3, DDX41, DDX1, DDX21 and DDX60 9 .",

Fourteen DDX proteins were found to contribute to viral multiplication. Among these, DDX19 appeared to be strongly required for influenza virus replication, and we therefore characterized its role in the IAV life cycle. DDX19 (DBP5 in yeast) is an evolutionary conserved factor in eukaryotes, which shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is associated to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) [20] [21] [22] . It plays a major role in promoting the directional export of cellular messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through the NPCs 3, 20, 23 . Recent studies revealed that the function of DDX19 in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking is not restricted to mRNPs, as it was found to mediate the nuclear export of pre-ribosomal subunits 24 and the nuclear import of the MLK1 transcription factor in an RNA-dependent manner 25 . In addition, DDX19 appears to control the fate of cellular RNAs at multiple levels from transcription to translation 26 .",

Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates prepared at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) to monitor the efficiency of viral replication. As shown in Fig. 1a , IAV replication was significantly impaired upon silencing of 14 DDX proteins: DDX3X, DDX5, DDX13, DDX17, DDX19A, DDX19B, DDX24, DDX25, DDX28, DDX31, DDX39B, DDX41, DDX46 and DDX47. Among the DDX proteins that had been previously found to positively regulate IAV replication, DDX3X, DDX5 and DDX17 19 and DDX39B 15 were recovered in our screen, but not DDX2B, possibly due to low knock-down efficiency ( Figure S1b ). DDX21 silencing, shown by others to negatively regulate IAV replication 14 , had no significant effect in our screen. Upon co-silencing of DDX19 A and B forms (96% identity at the protein level), the reduction of luciferase signal was significantly greater than upon silencing of DDX19A or DDX19B alone (a 90% reduction compared to 48% and 59%, respectively, Fig. 1a) , indicating a synergistic effect of DDX19A and DDX19B depletion. We repeated the experiment with three individual siRNAs targeting conserved regions between DDX19A and DDX19B (Fig. 1b,c) . A strong 76 to 90% reduction of the luciferase signal was observed with all three individual siRNAs (Fig. 1b) , thus ruling out any off-target effect. In the experiments described below, the combination of DDX19A and DDX19B siRNAs (thereafter named DDX19 siRNAs) was used.",

The effect on the accumulation of NP and NA vRNAs was delayed, as vRNA levels were strongly reduced at 6 hpi and still so at 9 hpi (5-and 5-fold for NP and 13-and 8-fold for NA at 6 and 9 hpi, respectively) ( Fig. 2d ,e). We hypothesize that mRNA levels appear less affected at 6 and 9 hpi because their accumulation has plateaued at these time points, unlike the viral vRNAs which continue to accumulate at a high rate. Notably, for each of the vRNA and mRNA species that were examined, the levels measured in DDX19-depleted cells at 6 and 9 hpi were similar to the levels measured in control cells at 3 and 6 hpi, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that DDX19 silencing does not distinctly affect the process of transcription/replication per se but delays the accumulation of viral RNAs from early time points of infection, which disrupts the whole viral cycle.",

            "text": "Scientific RepoRts | 6:33763 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33763 DDX19 contributes to the nuclear export of viral transcripts. We next examined the potential role of DDX19 in the export of viral mRNAs. To this end, siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected and subjected to subcellular fractionation at 2 and 4 hpi. The levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear PB2, NP, NA, NS1 and NS2 mRNAs were then determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4a,b) . At 2 hpi in control cells, a substantial proportion of each mRNA species (29% to 57%) was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4a, dark grey solid bars) . In DDX19-silenced cells, the proportions of cytoplasmic viral mRNAs were strikingly reduced (3% to 8%) (Fig. 4a, light grey solid bars) . The sensitivity of the M1-and M2-specific RT-qPCR was insufficient to evaluate accurately the levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear M1 and M2 mRNAs at 2 hpi. At 4 hpi in control cells, the viral mRNAs appeared equally distributed in both fractions (PB2, NP, NA) or predominantly cytoplasmic for NS1 and NS2 mRNAs (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, in DDX19-silenced cells, the viral mRNAs remained predominantly nuclear, with only 24% to 34% of the viral mRNAs being detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4b) . Although these differences were repeatedly observed (n = 3), the effect of DDX19 silencing at 4 hpi was generally not significant upon statistical analysis. The function of the homolog of DDX19 in yeast has been extensively studied and mutants defective for RNA binding (R372G, V386N, R428Q) or ATPase activity (E243Q) 20,32 , or NUP214 binding (R259A) 33, 34 show strong defects in the nuclear export of mRNAs. To confirm that these activities contribute to DDX19 function in IAV replication, we performed RNAi rescue experiments (Fig. 4c) . Upon silencing of DDX19 in HEK-293T cells, siRNA-resistant expression plasmids for the wild-type or mutant DDX19B proteins were transfected. Expression levels of the different DDX19B mutant proteins did not differ significantly (Fig. 4d) , and published data indicate that these are properly folded 25, 34 . The efficiency of viral replication was then assessed using the WSN-PB2-Nanoluc virus (Fig. 4c) . The wild-type DDX19B plasmid (dark grey bar) could rescue > 75% of the level of viral replication. This apparent contradiction with the fact that upon depletion, both DDX19A and DDX19B appear to play a role in viral infection (Fig. 1a) , is likely due to a high expression level of the recombinant DDX19B protein. Unlike the wild-type DDX19B plasmid (dark grey bar), none of the mutant plasmids tested (R259A, R372A, R428Q, E243Q, and E243Q/V386N, light grey bars) rescued the level of viral replication. Thus all activities related to DDX19B function in nuclear export of mRNAs appear to be required for IAV replication. Taken together with the nuclear retention of viral mRNAs in DDX19 depleted cells, our data clearly establish the essential contribution of DDX19 to the nuclear export of IAV mRNAs.",

HEK-293T cells transiently expressing the wild-type or mutant DDX19 proteins were subsequently infected with the WSN-PB2-Gluc1 virus. All DDX19 mutants fused to Gluc2 were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 5f ). As shown in Fig. 5e , similar DDX19-PB2 interaction signals were observed with DDX19 mutants defective for RNA binding and with the wild-type protein. These results are in agreement with our co-immunoprecipitation data showing that the DDX19-polymerase interaction is RNA-independent (Fig. 5a) . Interestingly, in the presence of the E243Q mutant, a significant increase of the DDX19-PB2 interaction signal was observed compared to the wild-type or to the E243Q-V386N double-mutant DDX19 protein (Fig. 5e ). The E243Q mutant was shown to be deficient for ATPase activity but, unlike the E243Q-V386N double-mutant, to retain a strong RNA binding activity 20 . Our data show that these properties result in the stabilization of the DDX19-PB2 interaction. Altogether, our results demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19.",

The hits of our RNAi screen include, in addition to DDX3X, DDX5, DDX17 and DDX39B that had been found previously to promote IAV replication 15, 19 , 10 new cellular factors potentially involved in IAV replication, i.e. DDX13, DDX19A/B, DDX24, DDX25, DDX28, DDX31, DDX41, DDX46 and DDX47. The most dramatic decrease in IAV replication was observed upon silencing of DDX19, which was therefore analyzed in more details. The roles of the other DDX hits remain to be investigated. Given the multi-functional nature of DDX proteins, each of them could potentially be involved at various steps of the viral cycle. Their recognized functions include splicing of pre-mRNAs for DDX41 36 Our study reveals that the cellular DDX19 protein plays an essential role during IAV infection by mediating viral mRNA export. Assuming that the regulatory mechanisms described for the yeast homolog of DDX19 are conserved in humans, DDX19 has a mRNP remodeling activity which depends on its RNA binding activity as well as its NUP214 binding and ATPase activities 27, 28 . This is consistent with our observation that DDX19 depletion i) inhibits the nuclear export of IAV mRNAs (Fig. 4a) and ii) leads to a reduction in viral replication that can be rescued by re-expressing the wild-type DDX19 protein, but not any of the mutants defective for RNA binding, NUP214 binding or ATPase activity (Fig. 4c) . The effect of DDX19 depletion on the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of viral mRNAs was detectable at 2 hpi and to a lesser extent at 4 hpi (Fig. 4a,b) , suggesting that the The levels of NP mRNAs and vRNAs co-purified with DDX19 are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM of four independent experiments. The background level of detection in control IgG eluates was 2.9 \u00d7 10 6 and 3.9 \u00d7 10 5 copies for NP vRNAs and NP mRNAs, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitated to input copy ratios between NP mRNAs and vRNAs differed significantly (multivariate linear model with an interaction term between sample type and RNA type, p = 0.0465). (c,d) HEK-293T cells expressing Strep-tagged wild-type DDX19B, mutant DDX19B or NXF1 were infected with WSN (5 pfu/cell). At 6 hpi, Strep-tagged proteins were purified, and the levels of co-purified mRNAs were determined (c). For wild-type DDX19B and NXF1, co-purified/total mRNAs ratios were normalized to the one obtained with the DDX19 mutant. The data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis (multivariate linear model) did not demonstrate significance. (d) Lysates and eluates were analyzed by immunoblot using Strep-Tactin. The dashed line indicates the juxtaposition of non-adjacent lanes from the same immunoblot.

The accumulation of high levels of viral mRNAs in the nucleus and/or virus-induced modifications of the cellular environment (e.g. altered permeability of the nuclear envelope 45 ) could allow viral mRNAs to be exported from the nucleus independently of DDX19. Still, in DDX19-depleted cells the inhibition of viral mRNA export at early time points results in a considerably delayed viral life cycle. By impairing the production of viral RNAs and viral proteins (Fig. 2) , it strongly reduces the production of infectious virus particles as observed with several IAV strains (Fig. 1e) . A possible role of DDX19 in the life cycle of other viruses that replicate in nucleus such as adenoviruses (Fig. 1g) or retroviruses 46 deserves further exploration.",

            "text": "The other major player that has been involved in IAV mRNA export so far is the Nuclear Export Factor 1 (NXF1), also known as TAP 18, 35 . It has been suggested that the intronless, unspliced, and spliced viral mRNAs may harbor differential dependence on NXF1 and/or use distinct adaptors to recruit NXF1 18, 47 . The three types of viral mRNAs were included in our study. They were all found to depend on DDX19 for their nuclear export (Fig. 4a) and to associate specifically with DDX19 in infected cells (Fig. 5c) . Based on the available structural data, DDX19 seems to bind RNA in a non sequence-specific manner, as most contacts are made with the sugar-phosphate backbone 28, 34 . It is unknown whether small RNAs such as microRNAs and tRNAs, or mRNPs transported by CRM1 rely on DDX19 for their nuclear export 23, 48 . It is also unclear whether all mRNPs transported by NXF1 undergo DDX19-mediated remodeling, or whether DDX19 is directed to specific mRNPs by adaptor proteins. To our knowledge the only documented case of such an adaptor is the SLIP1 protein, which binds DDX19 and could specifically target it to histone mRNAs 49 . Here, using iPCA ( Fig. 5e and ref. 29 ) and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5a) , we demonstrate a physical interaction between the viral polymerase and DDX19 in the context of infected cells. We show that this interaction is RNA-independent (Fig. 5a) . However, viral mRNAs can be co-purified with the polymerase-DDX19 complex (Fig. 5a,b) , suggesting that DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs through its interaction with the viral polymerase. Interestingly, the DDX19-polymerase interaction signal was higher in the presence of a E243Q DDX19 mutant able to bind RNA but deficient for ATPase activity 20 , which presumably compromises its ability to remodel exported mRNPs by dissociating RNA-binding protein components from the mRNPs 50,51 (Fig. 5e ). This observation suggests that the polymerase-DDX19-mRNA complex is transient and that the viral polymerase dissociates upon ATP hydrolysis-driven remodeling of viral mRNPs, in line with a previous report that viral mRNAs do not stably associate with the viral polymerase in infected cells 52 .",

One model proposes that the GLE1 nucleoporin ensures loading of DDX19-ATP onto the mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, where ATP hydrolysis-driven remodeling of mRNPs occurs 27 . A second model proposes that mRNPs are initially bound to DDX19-ATP and remodeled upon ATP hydrolysis, after which GLE1 stimulates the release of mRNPs from DDX19-ADP 28 . Our in cellulo observations are clearly in favor of the second model, which is also supported by the existence of an intranuclear pool of DDX19 that can associate with mRNPs and with the cellular transcription machinery 22, 53 . The binding of IAV polymerase to the C-terminal domain of cellular RNA polymerase II early in infection 54 might facilitate its association with DDX19 and thus the loading of DDX19 (possibly co-transcriptionally) onto viral mRNPs.",
