The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains. Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations. A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8). Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P<0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group. Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils. After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P<0.001). This study demonstrated that GALT is an effective cross-protective antigen, which could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against multiple APP serotypes. Wen X, et al. (2018) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GalT), an in vivo-induced antigen of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 5b strain L20, provided immunoprotection against serovar 1 strain MS71.

            "text": "Pig contagious pleuropneumonia (PCP) is one of the primary diseases of respiratory system in swine, causing swine cellulose pleurisy and pneumonia. APP is the etiologic agent of this disease. The murine model for APP respiratory tract infection has been experimentally developed to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines [1] . According to previous studies, this model is a far less laborious and resource intensive than the standard porcine model [2, 3] . 15 serovars have been reported over the past several decades, and a new serovar 16 was reported in 2017 [4, 5] . Traditionally, protection obtained from immunization has been serovar-specific; vaccines have typically lacked cross protective ability between different serovars [6] . As a result, vaccines had to be made from prevalent serovars within a given region, and have proven to be of little use in other areas where different serovars predominate [6] . Multivalent inactivated vaccines against APP have incorporated antigens from many serovars, and thus are more useful across multiple regions. Multivalent vaccines were shown to provide limited cross protection and partially reduced the incidence of the disease [7, 8] .",

The most promising vaccine candidates are cross protective antigens; typically these are immunogenic markers of pathogens highly conserved across multiple serovars [11] . Virulence factors of APP like Apx toxins, lipopolysaccharide, and capsular polysaccharides have been studied as cross-protective vaccine candidates [10, 12, 13] . ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII have proven to provide cross protection against different APP serovars [7, 10, 12] . ApxIV is another Apx toxin that possesses strong antigenic properties, the gene of which is conserved across all 16 known serovars of APP. A recombinant rApxIVN has been shown to induce a high level of antibodies and confers strong protection against challenges with different APP serovars [10] . Antigens that are conserved across many serovars of a given pathogen could be considered as potential components in cross protective vaccine development. Most microbial pathogens are isolated and cultured on artificial media (in vitro) in a clinical setting [14, 15] . Many virulence genes, including those that code for highly antigenic virulence factors, are inducible and expressed only in vivo [16] . Additionally, in vivo study of pathogens in hosts provides an opportunity to investigate humoral and cellular immune responses to infection. Many experimental methods have been developed for studying and targeting in vivo-induced genes such as signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM), in vivo expression technology (IVET), selective capture of transcribed sequences(SCOTS), all of which have been widely used to screen antigens of microbial pathogens [17] [18] [19] . These technologies have proven to be powerful tools in efforts in the development of cross reactive vaccines [20] .",

Antibacterial agents have been viewed as the first choice to treat the diseases caused by bacteria. However, the reported abuse and overuse of antibacterial agents is selecting for an ever-growing population of resistant pathogens, including APP [41] [42] [43] [44] . The use of vaccines has proven to be a better choice in efforts to control PCP outbreaks. Apart from use of traditional inactivated vaccine, many studies have focused on new vaccines to control PCP [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . GALT was demonstrated as an efficient antigen against APP, and could be taken as a potential vaccine candidate [36] . A different APP serovar 1 isolated strain MS71 was used in this study to analyze the cross-protection effects of recombinant protein GALT.

The results of phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that almost all APP strains are distributed in one phylogenetic branch. L20 and MS71, however are classified in a small side branch. The similarities between each two APP strains in this study range from 78.9% to 100% and that between L20 and MS71 is 83.1%. It is reported that PlpB across different P. multocidas strains exhibited a high level of homology (80.8%-99.4%), and the mice anti-rPlpB sera was cross-reactive with several P. multocida strains [53] . Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) gene of Escherichia coli strain shares an identity (90-100%) with other select E. coli (46.7%) and Shigella (52.8%) strains. Immunological tests show that the recombinant OmpF induces an effective immune response and provides a protection against multi-strain challenges [54] . The outer membrane protein, LamB, of Vibrio alginolyticus was also demonstrated as an effective cross protective antigen, which showed cross-reactivity [55] . ApfA, VacJ and PalA of APP were also studied for their potential as vaccine candidates. However, all of these antigens could induce antigen specific antibodies, but failed to induce protection against challenge [56, 57] . In the present study, recombinant GALT protein derived from L20 provided partially protection against MS71 challenge. The protection qualities of GALT may also exist between serovar 5b and the other serovars. GALT could induce a high level antibody response, indicating that this antigen has high immunogenic properties. Immunization of animals with inactivated whole-cell APP MS71 or L20 does not elicit any GALT specific antibodies. Therefore, GALT may be of use as a diagnostic antigen to differentiate animals infected or exposed to APP from those that were vaccinated against this agent ('infection' sera vs. 'vaccine' sera).",

GalT is a highly conserved gene which is distributed throughout 10 reference strains as well as isolated strains used in this study. The sequences of galT are conserved and the identities between any of the APP strains analyzed range from 79% to 100%. GALT specific antibodies could not to be detected in immune sera of animals vaccinated with inactivated APP MS71 or L20. Animals in the negative control group died rapidly after challenge, while the immunization groups provided partial protection. This demonstrated that immunization of recombinant GALT from APPsevorar 5b strain L20 confers cross protection against heterologous APP serovars. Histopathological and IHC analysis demonstrated that tissue damage was alleviated and the infiltration of neuthophils in the animal lung tissue was reduced post immunization with the application of GALT vaccine. In addition, bacterial phagocytosis of neutrophils was found to be significantly promoted by GALT specific antibodies. The present study demonstrated the function of GALT protein in a murine model, which is an important initial step in vaccine preparation trials. In the future, the potential vaccine candidate used in the present study should be tested for protective efficacy in pigs. ",
