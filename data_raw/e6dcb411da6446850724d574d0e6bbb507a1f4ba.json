A number of different PCR based assays for detection and discovery of multiple pathogens have been developed [1] [2] [3] [4] . Detection microarrays are proven to be useful in the identification and discovery of viruses homologous to known species. They have been used to guide the selection of samples for further analysis by sequencing [1] [2] [3] 5] . However, microarrays based on nucleic acid hybridization are too complex in design and performance for the routine donors testing, and exhibit a comparatively low sensitivity of detection, usually around 10021,000 genome copies of target virus per analyzed sample [1] [2] . Several PCR based assays coupled with oligonucleotide microarray technology (so called resequencing arrays) have been designed to allow simultaneous detection or genotyping of a target group of viruses, such as some critical blood-borne pathogens (3 viruses) [6] , respiratory viruses (16-21 viruses) [7] [8] , and respiratory adenoviruses (6 different serotypes) [9] . Such PCR based approach allows increasing the sensitivity of detection down to 10-100 copies of the target RNA or DNA in a sample.",

The written informed consent from the participants was waived under 45 CFR 46.101 (b) (4) . The six plasma samples positive for HIV-1 were estimated to contain 50 to ,90,000 genome copy numbers per ml; six plasma samples positive for HCV were estimated to contain 780 to ,123,000 genome copy number/ml and five plasma samples positive for HBV were estimated to contain ,150 to 16,000 copy number/ml. The copy numbers of viruses in these samples were provided by the NIH Blood Bank. No information about the subtypes or genotypes of these viruses was available.

All primers were checked for potential dimer formation using ''Primer Express'' software (version 3.0, Applied Biosystems). After design, all primers were again checked using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to avoid any cross-reactivity with other species. Newly designed and previously published primer sets adapted for the final version of the real-time PCR array are listed in Table 1 .

The 4th primer set, NP175/174, (targeting the conserved pol region and containing degenerative nucleotides to support broader variant coverage) could detect the virus only at 500 viral genome copies/ml of plasma. HIV-2 RNA was detected with primer set NP86/87 at the concentration of 10 copies/ml and with the primer set NP76/77 at the concentration of 50 copies/ml. Another primer set (NP84/ 85) detected HIV-2 at 100 copies/ml. HBV (genotype A) DNA was detected with the primer set NP11/97 at 50 copies/ml and with NP94/100 at 100 copies/ml. The third HBV specific primer set (NP11/97-mod) detected HBV at 500 copies/ml of plasma. Both HCV specific primer sets targeting the viral 59NTR detected HCV RNA at the concentration of 10 copies/ml of plasma. Two of the WNV-specific primer sets (NP21/22, targeting E protein gene, and NP176/177, targeting NS5) detected WNV at 50 copies/ml and the third primer set (NP178/179, also targeting NS5) gave a positive signal at 100 copies/ml of plasma.",

The lower Tm range (74.5-75.5uC) was detected for genotype A and the higher Tm range (76.8-77.4uC) -for genotypes B, C, and D.

None of the primer sets selected for a particular target virus in the array produced non-specific cross-reaction toward the other viruses. Comparative performance of the array was also evaluated through the testing of 17 clinical specimens from the United States patient population. All 17 samples were correctly identified in our PCR array with a high sensitivity to contain HIV-1, HCV, or HBV. We found that a combination of several primer sets targeting each virus in the array allows for the detection of different variants of the virus; however, it makes the absolute quantification with uniform DNA/RNA standards a challenge. Quantification by the assay is not always possible when the genetic group of the viral isolate being tested is different than the assay standards. This is one of the reasons why in certain cases the commercial assays underestimate viral loads by up to 1-10 log 10 copies per ml [37] [38] [39] . Nevertheless, relative quantification can be done using all primer sets selected for the array, and the absolute quantification can be performed with DNA/RNA standards using the primers targeting the most conserved genome areas. There are several commercial qualitative multiplex NAT assays now available on the market simultaneously targeting three most important blood-borne viral pathogens (HIV-1, HCV and HBV) [40] .

The LOD for HBV are 38.1-195 geq/ml by ''Procleix Ultrio Tigris'' and 9.2-37. Other PCR-coupled techniques have been developed previously for highly-sensitive pathogens' detection that could reach the sensitivity of the assay up to 1 genome copy per PCR reaction. For example the bioactive amplification with probing (BAP), utilizing a nested PCR and magnetic bead-based hybridization with the specific probe, has been developed for the detection of bovine and avian viruses [41] [42] [43] . In spite of the exceeding sensitivity of such assays targeting a single virus, it may be difficult to adapt the approach or method to meet the main objective of simultaneous detection of multiple target viral pathogens by an array using universal PCR conditions.",

Comparison of experimentally obtained Tm peaks to the range of expected specific Tm peaks allows rapid identification or exclusion of the viral pathogen in a sample. This is an initial study to examine the suitability of using PCR arrays for the detection of a group of target viruses. The current array was developed utilizing five previously published and Table 4 . Tm and C(t) values obtained with primer sets specific for HIV-1, HCV, or HBV in testing of 17 human clinical samples in the format of PCR array targeting eight different viruses. 19 originally designed primers sets. However, it can be expanded to a larger number of targets for the same virus. Targeting of several genome areas increases the detection sensitivity of the target virus and provides an intra-assay confirmation of positive signals. Additionally, any new virus of interest can be added to the list of targeted pathogens. Efforts are underway to test the utility of this real-time PCR array using samples with more diverse biological origin and pathogen content. ",
