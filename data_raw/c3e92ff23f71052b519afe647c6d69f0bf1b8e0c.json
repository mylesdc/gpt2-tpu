A 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. The management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers' cost to benchmark. The objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. We calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. We found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. The total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per Kg of gain decreased. The ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. In conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning.",

The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0-2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively.

Improved fertility and increased use of sexed semen have made replacement heifers more available for dairy operations [2] . Some producers keep all newborn replacement heifers in case more replacements are needed than anticipated, which can create a heavy financial burden for producers when raising excess heifers. Heifer raising expenses are often lumped into broad farm-wide expenses such as feed, labor, and health costs, making it difficult to accurately calculate heifer raising costs [3] . In addition, failing to identify the on-farm cost to raise a replacement heifer can allow for inefficiencies in feed, labor, housing, or health costs to go unnoticed, which accumulate unanticipated replacement female costs.",

For example, the average total cost to raise replacement heifers to wean was found to only increase by $82.88 per heifer from 2000 to 2015 but ranges within each study can exceed $350 per heifer [4] [5] [6] . Heinrichs [6] found a range in feed cost on 44 farms of $29.06 to $259.17 per calf; total cost per calf ranged $89.00-$442.78 during the pre-weaning period. In a 2014 survey of 2545 heifer calves in the United States, individual housing was the dominant form of housing pre-weaned heifers at 86.6% and 13.4% were managed in group housing, yet 8 different housing types were reported [7] . Little research has examined the cost between housing types, although the University of Wisconsin has conducted surveys of producers in an automatic and conventional housing scenario. The average cost (min, max) of producers utilizing individual housing was $363.69 ($195 .06, $530.76) and those with group housing was $401.58 ($138.39, $585.52), a difference in average cost of $37.89 per calf, but with a difference range of over $300 for individual and $400 for group housing [8] .",

On average, one calf requires 7-12 labor hours during the pre-weaning period, or 7-10 mins per day [8] . Unpasteurized whole milk was the most common milk source utilized by producers but close to 50% of those also utilized milk replacer [7] . More recent surveys show a similar trend, with 40.1% of calves fed whole or waste milk, 34.8% fed milk replacer, and 25.1% fed a combination of the two.

This economic model was developed in Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) utilizing @RISK and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). The base herd used included 1500 milking cows, 1000 replacement heifers in total and 84 heifer calves in the pre-weaning period, assuming a 30% replacement rate and an average age at first calving of 25 months. Costs were calculated on a per head basis for housing, feed, labor, mortality, and health. All remaining variables are static. Interest was accounted for on infrastructure and mortality as well as the depreciation of assets related to replacement females. Costs associated with herd-wide parameters, such as disease prevalence and mortality rates, were distributed across all remaining calves in the pre-weaning phase. The model required a management decision at 3 points: housing type, milk source, and labor shown in Figure 1 . Three main housing types were modeled: individual housing outside (IHO), individual housing inside (IHI) [10] , and group housing (GH). Three milk sources were built into the model: whole milk (WM), pasteurized whole milk (PWM), or milk replacer (MR). Four possible liquid feeding plans were modeled: 6, 8, 10, and 12 L of milk per calf per day. Labor was modeled for two categories: conventional, where a person was assigned to feeding and caring for the calves; or automatic, where an automatic calf feeder was utilized in addition to human labor. Totals costs were reported per calf for each management decision, the entire pre-weaning period per calf, and per day per calf. Per day cost was calculated by dividing days of age at weaning by the total cost per calf during the pre-weaning period.",

Barn cost was derived from the Dairy Calf and Heifer Association Gold Standard recommendation of 3.3 M 2 per calf, with an additional 15% of space to account for walkways and feed areas. Thus, replacement heifers were assumed to require 3.7 M 2 per calf. Construction cost [11] varied based on the infrastructure required for each situation, ranging from $10.00 to $15.50 per M 2 . Estimated barn value (BV) was then calculated with Equation (1). BV = CC \u00d7 3.7 M 2 \u00d7 number of pre-weaned calves (1) Barn cost per heifer (BC) was calculated using the payment function in excel with 7% interest, 20 years useful life and BV. BC was included in IHI and GH situations. Calves housed in individual housing outside followed the same payment function. Housing calves year-round in individual housing with an average occupancy time of 2 months \u00b1 rest period would allow 5 calves per hutch per year. Days of age at weaning was used as the length of time a heifer was incurring cost during the pre-weaning period. Housing costs also included utility costs, such as water and electricity. Electricity was only factored for housing systems that included a barn (IHI and GH). The bedding was included at a flat evaluation of $11.00 per calf. For pasture scenarios, a cash value price per acre was used as the value of land to try to account for the opportunity cost of a specific acre being used for other purposes. An additional annual maintenance cost of $31.50 per acre was assumed.",

The model accounted for four possible feeding milk allotments: 6, 8, 10, and 12 L per calf per day. A 2016 survey of producers in the United States showed over half of the farms were feeding calves between 4-6 L per day [7] . Recent studies have shown that increasing milk allotment can increase average daily gain (ADG) pre-weaning, result in larger skeletal measurements at weaning, and decrease vocalizations caused by milk deprivation [12, 13] . Milk allotments and starter intakes per calf for this model were reflective of experimental data [14] . In this study, calves were randomly assigned to 6, 8, 10, or 12 L feeding treatments of pasteurized whole milk with ad libitum access to calf starter. A step-down weaning program was performed: milk was fed at maximum allotment until weaning at 42 days. Milk allotment was decreased by 50% until day 50, where allotment was decreased daily by 20% until weaned. Calves were assumed to be consuming at least 2.25 kg of calf starter at weaning. An additional 20% was assumed to be fed to account for waste and loss. This additional expense was added to daily calf starter cost. Milk and calf starter costs were calculated on a daily basis for the entire pre-weaning period, from day 0 to 65. ADG was determined using the dry matter intake requirements and resulting gain from NRC, 2001. Calf weight was modeled daily to determine appropriate weaning weights based on dry matter intake from milk replacer or whole milk.",

Feed represented the largest factor in all management scenarios, followed by labor, then variable and fixed costs. This follows the same results found in previously published models where 57% of total cost were due to feed costs [6] . Using the assumptions in Table 1 , on average, the most expensive management style was the one utilizing group housing, feeding pasteurized whole milk with conventional labor. The least expensive management pathway was the one utilizing individual housing outside, feeding whole milk with conventional labor. The main difference in cost can be attributed to the larger infrastructure needs for group housing and the additional cost of a pasteurizer. Total and daily cost for all management scenarios with 6, 8, 10, and 12 L allotments are shown in Table 3 .",

As seen in previous literature, the mean cost in each milk allotment has less variation than when looking at the range of projected costs per management scenario. This can be attributed to variation in health and mortality rates. Increasing the mortality rate and disease prevalence increased the cost for the remaining calves by spreading infrastructure costs, the loss of the calf and incurred expenses, and additional illness treatments over fewer calves. Variation in costs is not always related to efficiency on-farm but instead related to trade-offs in management styles.",

The average daily charge for a contract raiser from birth to weaning was $1.88/day [16] . Based on our calculated total cost for rearing pre-weaning calves, this would create a significant loss for the contract raiser. But in the Wisconsin heifer raising survey the cost per day of fixed and variable costs, which most closely matches our model, $2.05-$8.73 for minimum and maximum daily cost [8] . This simulation model can be compared to surveys to validate the results are reflective of on-farm total values. Finally, this model can be used to estimate other housing situations other than the ones presented in the current survey, and herd numbers could be used to estimate heifer costs for individual herds. In this survey, we chose the most common management practices to raise dairy heifers in North America, but there are many other options of housing and feeding dairy heifer calves that require further investigation.",

Milk and calf starter contributed over half the cost to raise a calf from birth to weaning. Costs calculated by this model are based on currently available data; it is likely some of our assumptions will under or overestimate total and specific costs of calf raising practices across the US. More data are needed to improve accurate assumptions for farms. However, no model will be able to accurately describe all situations of calf rearing in various locations. Calculating pre-weaning cost for each individual farm is critical in making management decisions and remaining sustainable.",
