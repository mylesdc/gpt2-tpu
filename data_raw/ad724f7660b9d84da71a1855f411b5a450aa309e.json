Moreover, many of these viruses are select agents (SAs), and their genomes are also considered SAs. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA before transfer out of the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This tremendously limits the capacity to conduct viral genomic research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA while simultaneously abolishing both viral and genomic RNA infectivity across multiple single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA\u03e9) virus families. The process generates barcoded DNA amplicons that range in length from 300 to 1,000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable to transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows for up to 288 barcoded samples to be pooled into a single library and run across various NGS platforms without potential reconstitution of the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach provides full-length genomic sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations but it can also recover specific viral sequence from samples with limited starting material in the background of cellular RNA, and it can be used to identify pathogens from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid, universal standard operating procedure that generates highquality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA.",

Even when not encapsidated by viral structural proteins, positivesense RNA genomes are sufficient to initiate translation and viral replication upon introduction into permissive cells. The infectious nature of ssRNA\u03e9 viral genomes has made them amenable to reverse genetic manipulation for more than 30 years (2, 3) . However, this property is a contributing factor in classifying many ssRNA\u03e9 viruses as select agents (SAs) under the Federal Select Agent Program (4) . Moreover, many ssRNA\u03e9 viruses are high-priority biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens, with a subset listed as potential bioterrorism agents by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (5, 6) . An additional complication is that full-length cDNAs from ssRNA\u03e9 viruses that are SAs can be used to create RNA and rescue/recover the pathogen. Thus, in some instances, large cDNAs, double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs), or clones containing at least two-thirds of the genome may also be regulated as SAs.",

This poses a challenge for timely sample processing and sequence analysis, which could significantly hamper responses during outbreak situations. Typically, all products generated from infectious material must be proven to no longer contain infectious viral particles or infectious genomic RNA prior to transfer to a BSL-2 space. Confirming loss of infectivity (LOI) typically occurs via blind infectivity testing, where a subset of the material is placed on a permissive cell line for at least three subsequent passages (8) . For this reason, transferring cDNAs or other nucleic acids from a BSL-3/4 laboratory to a BSL-2 laboratory is a very difficult and time-consuming process for many laboratories. Some investigators have worked out procedures that have been approved by their institutional biosafety committee; however, these procedures vary from institution to institution. For example, some BSL-3 facilities work with mosquito-transmitted ssRNA\u03e9 viruses including West Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that are not considered SAs. Other BSL-3 facilities contain ssRNA\u03e9 viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) that are classified as SAs, but these facilities have safety protocols that allow transfer of genomic RNA or cDNA from BSL-3 to BSL-2 directly by scientists. Finally, there are BSL-3 facilities working with SAs such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). Here, only trained safety personnel are allowed to transfer cDNA samples from high-containment laboratories to BSL-2 laboratories after inactivation has been carried out under a validated protocol. For each of these scenarios, a robust, universal standard operating procedure (SOP) to eliminate infectious material while rapidly generating next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries is critically needed.",

Among the foreign animal disease viruses, FMDV is the most contagious and has historically set standards for biosafety and biosecurity policies and procedures. The required biosafety level to carry out any infectious virus work with FMDV is biosafety level 3 agriculture (BSL-3Ag), and currently, the only facility authorized to work with FMDV in the United States is PIADC (BSL-3Ag safety considerations reviewed in references 10 and 11) . The fact that the viral RNA and RNA derived from infected samples can be infectious when transfected or electroporated into susceptible cells results in strict regulation of any nucleic acid derived from FMDVinfected material. Currently, the only approved methodology to remove FMDV nucleic acids from the BSL-3Ag laboratory at PIADC involves harsh alkaline and thermal treatment that potentially has a deleterious effect on putative NGS libraries (12; M. McIntosh, personal communication) . In addition, removal of material derived from diverse BSL-3/4 ssRNA\u03e9 pathogens out of containment requires time-consuming procedures (e.g., multiple blind infectivity passages) to rule out the presence of infectious material. This tremendously limits the capacity to conduct genomic research with viral samples, particularly the application of NGS techniques to understand viral pathogenesis, viral ecology, and vaccine development.",

Here, we present a robust SOP for generating high-quality, barcoded cDNAs directly from genomic RNA across multiple virus families. Families represented include Picornaviridae, Alphaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Coronaviridae, which have genome sizes from~7 kb to 28 kb. The strategy builds upon established sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) methods (13) (14) (15) . Our data prove that barcoded NGS sequencing libraries can be rapidly generated while simultaneously destroying both viral particle and genomic RNA infectivity. Our approach is scalable, highly adaptable, and sensitive. The SOP generates high-quality sequences spanning the entire genome, up to 288 pooled barcoded samples can be examined in a single NGS run, and the products of the SOP work on multiple NGS platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, and Ion Torrent). The SOP works on starting material of purified virus, tissue culture samples, or tissue samples. We are able to detect virus-specific reads in samples where the input is fewer than 10 PFU and can identify viruses present in an unknown sample. Therefore, this application has potential for rapid sequencing of high-titer viral stocks as well as virus discovery and/or forensics. Finally, the nonspecific nature of the amplification makes this SOP adaptable to negative-strand RNA viruses (ssRNA\u03ea), double-strand RNA (dsRNA), single-strand DNA (ssDNA), or double-strand DNA (dsDNA) viruses.",

First, viral RNA is isolated using a commercially available RNeasy kit or Trizol. Second, purified viral RNA is used as a template for sequence-independent cDNA synthesis, and a random library of barcoded PCR products is constructed. Third, DNA products of the SOP are treated with RNase. Fourth, SOP products are purified. At this point, we tested all products of the SOP for loss of viral infectivity and for the absence of infectious full-length viral genomic RNA. This step is not highlighted yellow in Fig. 1 and is not included in the final SOP, since the methods are virus specific. Fifth, immediately prior to transfer, all samples are heated at 72\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate any potential virus contamination that could inadvertently occur during cDNA generation and purification (16) . Sixth, all samples are transferred from BSL-3/4 to BSL-2 space. Seventh, products from the SOP are pooled and subjected to NGS library construction. Eighth, libraries are sequenced. Ninth, sequence data are analyzed and computationally assembled in standard office space.

High-titer samples of coronaviruses, flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and picornaviruses were processed, and an aliquot of each sample was used to test for infectious virus or infectious viral gRNA (see Materials and Methods and Table 1 ). Currently, blind passaging of potentially infectious material on permissive cells is a standard assay for infectivity. Negative results from blind passages are often required to remove products out of a BSL-3 facility. This method can detect infectious virus from as little as 1 PFU or from infectious viral gRNA of limited genomes (Table 1) . No viral infectivity is present after testing of 309 samples derived from six different ssRNA\u03e9 viruses (Table 1) . Moreover, no genomic RNA infectivity is present after testing 324 samples. In all cases, positive-control samples confirmed that each cell line clearly detected both viral infectivity and gRNA infectivity. While these results suggest that the SOP completely inactivates infectious material, an additional heat inactivation step was included to further reduce the risk of residual infectious material leaving BSL-3/4 containment. Heat treatment at 72\u00b0C for 30 min completely abolishes infectious HRV-16, WNV, and all seven FMDV serotypes (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Heat inactivation for CHIKV and MERS-CoV was not performed, but our data indicate the ability of the SOP to eliminate infectivity from both enveloped and nonenveloped ssRNA\u03e9 viruses. Moreover, high-quality sequence is recovered after heat inactivation of the SISPA products for both WNV and HRV-16 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). It is important to note that for non-SA viruses, the RNA may be removed to the BSL-2 in RNA lysis buffer prior to cDNA generation if approved by the individual's institutional biosafety committee (IBC).",

We first determined that the limit of detectable RNA infectivity for HRV-16 occurs in the range between 0.1 and 0.01 PFU on H1 HeLa cells (Table 1 ). Next, gRNA from HRV-16 (1 \u03eb 10 6 PFU equivalents per sample) were subjected to either the entire SOP or stopped at intermediate steps (diagrammed in Fig. 3A ). Briefly, 10 replicates for select steps in the SOP were transfected into H1 HeLa cells. First, purified HRV-16 RNA from 10 6 PFU was transfected into H1 HeLa cells prior to initiating the SOP (positive control for transfection). Second, the SOP was stopped after PCR amplification, and the PCR products were purified. Third, the SOP was used to generate PCR products, which were treated with 2 l of an RNase cocktail and purified. Fourth, the final products from the SOP were heat inactivated (which encompasses the entire SOP). As a control for the efficacy of the RNase cocktail, RNA from 10 6 PFU of HRV-16 was treated with the amount of RNase from the SOP. Material from each group was then transfected into H1 HeLa cells and subjected to three blind passages to demonstrate that infectivity was destroyed.",

To build on the data obtained with HRV-16, a similar approach was followed with FMDV ( Fig. 3) . Corroborating the HRV-16 results, FMDV gRNA infectivity is abolished post-PCR in the absence of the RNase cocktail (Fig. 3C ). These two experiments highlight that the SOP efficiently inactivates all infectious gRNA at an early step in the SOP and that subsequent steps serve as additional fail-safes for inactivation.

We next sought to further define the SOP limits of detection on a MiSeq platform and directly compare this sensitivity to sequencespecific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qrRT-PCR). Separate experiments with dilutions of HRV-16 virions and HRV-16 gRNA in both pure (cell-free supernatant containing virions) and mixed (cellular RNA spiked with HRV-16) samples were performed. For test 1 (Fig. 5A) , a virion dilution series precedes RNA extraction, followed by the SOP. For test 2 (Fig. 5B) , virion RNA was extracted from a high-titer stock, followed by serial dilution, and aliquots from each dilution were subjected to the SOP. For test 3 (Fig. 5C ), virion dilutions described in test 1 were mixed with HeLa cells. Total RNA was extracted from each tube, and rRNA was removed before proceeding to the SOP. For test 4 (Fig. 5D) , aliquots from each dilution of viral RNA described in test 2 were added to 1 g of total HeLa cell RNA. rRNA was removed, and the material was subjected to the SOP. Representative MiSeq data (black line) from each test is displayed in Fig. 5A to D as the number of HRV-16-specific sequencing reads per sample. Prior to initiating the SOP, an aliquot of diluted RNA from each sample was analyzed by qrRT-PCR to determine the input viral RNA copy number (red line). This input value provides a comparison for the sequence read output. The approximate qrRT-PCR and MiSeq LODs for this experiment are as follows: qrRT-PCR LOD of 8. 33 However, the SOP has the advantage over qrRT-PCR of requiring no a priori knowledge of the sequence of interest and has the benefit of providing sequence information from both known and unknown samples.",

Another experiment was designed to determine the ability of the SOP to detect WNV-specific sequencing reads in both acutely and persistently infected mouse tissues. For this study, the SOP was performed to generate libraries from the footpad (site of inoculation) and the brain (target organ of WNV) at days 5, 10, and 29; both tissues support viral production with infectious virus present for at least 1 month after inoculation (18, 24) . Samples were pooled and sequenced on eight HiSeq lanes to ensure sufficient sequencing depth for a proper analysis, yielding between 20 and 90 million reads per sample. Viral loads peak in the footpad at day 5 and diminish by day 29 (Fig. 6C) , while peak brain titers occur at day 10 postinoculation (Fig. 6D) .

Raw data underwent de novo assembly, and large contigs (\u03fe500 bp) were used to identify the best full-length viral genome references by a nucleotide BLAST search. Sequencing reads were then mapped onto the selected reference genome, and mapping coverage was determined (Fig. 7) . For St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we obtained more than 98% genome coverage, clearly demonstrating the ability of the SOP to rapidly identify ssRNA\u03e9 viruses from samples without prior information.

            "text": "The core objective of a biosafety program is the containment of potentially harmful biological and infectious agents. Standardization of lab practices at all BSLs are defined (7), but the transfer of potentially infectious material out of high-containment facilities is very challenging and is sometimes the source of containment breaches. Likewise, during outbreak situations, the need to handle samples containing potentially infectious viral genomes (or genetic material falling under SA regulations) under high containment may significantly hinder public health responses. In this report, we demonstrate the development of a robust SOP for generating high-quality cDNAs from ssRNA\u03e9 viruses, which can be used in highly parallel processes to quickly and safely remove samples from BSL-3/4 containment for subsequent genomic sequencing or other similar procedures in BSL-2 laboratories. Protocols to generate NGS sequencing libraries for ssRNA\u03e9 viruses do exist. For example, a recent report (20) describes a method for FMDV whole-genome sequencing, but it was not proven to destroy infectious material. In addition to complete genome coverage, our data confirm that full-length RNAs, cDNAs, or dsDNAs from these processes cannot be used to recover/ rescue infectious viruses. We demonstrate that this SOP completely inactivates viruses from diverse virus families classified as SAs or considered high-consequence pathogens. The SOP removes infectious genomic RNAs and simultaneously amplifies barcoded cDNAs that cannot be used to rescue/recover viruses (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). The SOP also generates high-quality cDNA libraries, and the resulting NGS data covers almost entire ssRNA\u03e9 viral genomes from samples tested ( Fig. 2 and 4) . The SISPA method is unable to fully define viral genomic termini, since the method utilizes random hexamer priming. Therefore, additional protocols, such as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) are required for this sequence information. The procedure is sequence independent and can be utilized on both known and unknown viruses (new/emerging), regardless of prior genome information. Sequence independence also enables simultaneous identification of multiple pathogens in a sample (e.g., coinfections) or even modified, manufactured pathogens. The described strategy is efficient, scalable, and inexpensive and requires only reagents and equipment that are commonly used in BSL-3/4 laboratories, whereas NGS sequencing equipment is expensive and difficult to maintain, especially within high-containment laboratories. This SOP builds on the established SISPA method (13, 14) to create small overlapping fragments that are barcoded (i.e., uniquely tagged) by the addition of nucleotides to the termini. Our barcoding system has many advantages. (i) The barcoded DNAs cannot be used to recover/rescue viruses, so they can be safely transferred to BSL-2 sequencing centers onsite or shipped to large-scale sequencing centers. (ii) Our system allows for the PCR amplification of the genomic material (thus, limited amounts of sample or low copy number can yield whole genomes). (iii) It can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction.",

The strategy can be applied to diverse starting material such as cell culture supernatants, infected-cell monolayers, and animal tissues. While much of the representative data shown was derived from Illumina MiSeq, the SOP can be applied to multiple platforms, including Illumina HiSeq and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). The PGM provides a rapid turnaround time, which allows for viral sequence data to be obtained in hours compared to longer times required for Illumina platforms. An interesting result from this study was the observation that both the Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq platforms have similar limits of detection on identical NGS libraries (Fig. 4) . This is likely because the MiSeq platform sequences most virus-specific molecules in the library, and the HiSeq platform only adds more reads from the same starting material. It is important to note that the HiSeq platform is still relevant for host gene expression analysis, since additional sequencing depth is critical to provide adequate coverage across all mammalian mRNAs. We are also able to directly compare the sensitivity of the SOP to sequence-specific quantitative qrRT-PCR methods (Fig. 5) . While qrRT-PCR is more sensitive, it requires prior knowledge of the sequence of interest, while SISPA does not. Further, we can detect HRV-16-specific sequence from both limiting amounts of HRV-16 virion RNA and from samples where the majority of the sequence data are host derived. We demonstrate the ability to detect low levels of WNV-specific sequence from persistently infected mouse tissues as late as 29 days postinfection (Fig. 6) . Future studies will optimize the SOP to improve assay sensitivity to further reduce sequencing cost in samples with limited starting material. However, these data illustrate the value of this protocol for virus discovery and/or forensic analyses.",

Our experimental design is sufficient to state with high confidence that the SOP abolishes infectivity because of the following. (i) The input infectious dose for each sample is high. (ii) The limit of detection for each infectivity test is low. (iii) The sample size is sufficiently high. It is important to note that to assign a confidence interval for this assay, there must be some failures or variability in the final outcome (e.g., cultures positive for infectivity during loss of infectivity testing). Our processing of all samples since the initiation of the experiment has a success rate of 100% (Table 1) . The ability to demonstrate that all RNA infectivity is lost after the PCR step for both HRV-16 and FMDV (Fig. 3 ) strongly suggests that a final RNase step serves as an additional safeguard to remove infectious RNA. Finally, the heat step of 72\u00b0C for 30 min ensures no residual infectivity due to lab contamination is present prior to transfer from BSL-3 to BSL-2 (see Table S3 and Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). However, this step is considered fail-safe, as we demonstrate that infectivity is abolished after the PCR step (Fig. 3) .",

Limited FMDV population diversity studies explore both intrasample variation during serial passage and the presence of FMDV quasispecies within an infected animal (26, 27) ; therefore, the described SOP is especially promising for FMDV genomic analyses. To overcome the cost and time limitation of using conventional NGS protocols for FMDV studies in large data sets, a previous study combined NGS and Sanger data with sequences available in public databases to study microevolutionary processes of FMDV populations at multiple scales (28) . A protocol to generate consensus level genome sequences for FMDV and a few other positive-sense polyadenylated RNA viruses has been reported (20) , but it was exclusively tested on an Illumina MiSeq platform. In contrast, our SOP provides extra versatility and cost efficiency, as it has been adapted to multiple sequencing platforms, and it allows analysis of up to 288 barcoded samples in a single run. Therefore, the scalability and cost-efficiency of the SOP described here make it a promising approach to examine quasispecies from large data sets, and it can provide sufficient sequencing depth to examine minor variants from high-titer stocks (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).

Alternative virus discovery approaches have utilized degenerate primers for specific virus families, virus-specific probes (32) , and random primers for signal amplification and subsequent NGS library construction (13, 14) . Our SISPA approach couples a barcode sequence and random hexamer in a single oligonucleotide and requires no prior knowledge of the sample composition (Fig. 7) .

Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), University of Wisconsin-Madison, Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), University of Maryland School of Medicine, and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. A detailed, standardized protocol describing all procedures and reagents is supplied in the supplemental material. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from viral stocks, virus-infected cells, or virus-infected tissues. Random hexamer oligonucleotides coupled with unique barcodes (denoted BC-N6) were used for first-strand cDNA (Life Technologies) and second-strand DNA (New England Biolabs) synthesis. The first-strand cDNA synthesis step also includes treatment with RNase H (catalog no. M0297S; New England Biolabs) (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). A second primer, specific for each barcode but lacking a random hexamer, was then used to generate PCR fragments ranging in size from approximately 300 to 1,000 bp (Life Technologies). An example of a BC-N6 primer sequence is 5=-TAGTACACTCTAGAGCACTANNNNNN-3=, and the corresponding PCR primer sequence is 5=-TAGTACACTCTAGAGCACTA-3=. In order to overcome the problems associated with low diversity in the first cycles of Illumina reads (33), we modified the SISPA protocol by adding either 3 N's or 4 N's to the 5= ends of the SISPA PCR primers for each barcode, and using an equimolar combination of these modified primers during the PCR amplification step of the protocol. A list of BC-N6 and PCR primer sequences has been described previously (15) . All SOP products were treated with an RNase cocktail (Life Technologies) and purified (Qiagen). A subset of samples were subjected to heat inactivation at 72\u00b0C for 30 min. All BSL-3 samples that required the loss of virus and RNA infectivity were subjected to testing consistent with the specific institutional biosafety standards. Final products of the SOP were shipped to JCVI, pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (two 300-bp paired end [PE] sequencing reads), Illumina HiSeq (two 100-bp PE), Illumina NextSeq (two 150-bp PE), or Ion Torrent (318 Chip 400-bp kit) platforms.",

Duplicate reads were removed, reads were demultiplexed based on each sample's specific barcode sequence, and reads were both sequence trimmed to remove the barcode and random hexamer and quality trimmed to remove low-quality bases. SISPA barcodes are designed to have a minimum edit distance of 5 between any two barcodes, such that during demultiplexing, two errors may be allowed when searching for barcode sequences at the termini of reads. For barcode demultiplexing, we used bespoke software available from http://sourceforge.net/ projects/deconvolver/ to identify SISPA barcode sequences, bin and trim the barcode and random hexamer, but other software packages may be used as well. For samples with a known input sequence, reads were mapped to a prespecified reference sequence. For samples with an unknown input sequence, reads were de novo assembled, and the resulting contigs longer than 500 nucleotides (nt) were used to search for the most appropriate reference sequences available in GenBank, using NCBI's BLASTN against the NT database, with a filter for viruses (taxonomy identifier [ID] [taxid]10239). Once the closest references were chosen, reads were mapped to the selected references. For all analyses, the number of reads that mapped to the references, the percent genome coverage from these mappings, and the number of unmapped reads were determined. When sufficient sequence depth was available, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined using JCVI custom software. This pipeline applies statistical tests to minimize false-positive SNP calls that could be caused by the types of sequencespecific errors (SSE) that may occur in Illumina reads previously identified and described (21) . Once a minimum minor allele frequency threshold and significance level are established by the user, the number of minor allele observations and major allele observations in each direction and the minimum minor allele frequency threshold are used to calculate a P value based on the binomial distribution cumulative probability, and if the P values calculated in each of the two sequencing directions are both less than the Bonferroni-corrected significance level, then the SNP call is accepted. For our analyses, we used a significance level of 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for tests in each direction to 0.025), and a minimum minor allele frequency threshold of 3%.",

(C and D) Footpad (C) and brain tissue (D) from WNV-infected mice were analyzed at 5, 10, and 29 days postinfection for WNV-specific sequence reads by Illumina HiSeq. (A) Data representing the ability of the SOP to identify WNV-specific reads from limiting dilutions of WNV-infected Vero cells spiked into uninfected 293T cells. Mapped and unmapped reads from each sample are displayed. (B) The SOP identifies WNV-specific reads from limiting dilutions of WNV-infected Vero cells spiked into uninfected mouse tissues (spleen and brain). Mapped and unmapped reads from each sample are shown. (C) WNV was detected in the footpad RNA of mice prepared according to the SOP at the indicated times postinfection. (D) WNV-specific reads can be detected from brain tissue RNA of mice at the indicated times postinfection. For panels C and D, three mice per group were analyzed, and WNV-mapped and unmapped reads are shown.",
