Here we show that V-set immunoglobulin-domain-containing 4 (VSIG4), a B7 family-related protein that is expressed by resting macrophages, inhibits macrophage activation in response to lipopolysaccharide. Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice are susceptible to high-fat diet-caused obesity and murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3)-induced fulminant hepatitis due to excessive macrophage-dependent inflammation. VSIG4 activates the PI3K/ Akt-STAT3 pathway, leading to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDK2) upregulation and subsequent phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which results in reduction in pyruvate/acetyl-CoA conversion, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species secretion, and macrophage inhibition. Conversely, interruption of Vsig4 or Pdk2 promotes inflammation. Forced expression of Vsig4 in mice ameliorates MHV-3-induced viral fulminant hepatitis. These data show that VSIG4 negatively regulates macrophage activation by reprogramming mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.",

            "text": "M acrophages are essential for innate immunity owing to functions in host defense, tissue development and homeostasis 1 . Macrophage functional disparity is attributed to two distinct subgroups, namely M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) macrophages 2 . M1 macrophages have been implicated in initiating and sustaining inflammation in response to INF-\u03b3 and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas IL-4 or IL-13 polarized M2 macrophages seem to have immunoregulatory functions in parasitic infections, tissue inflammation, remodeling of damaged tissue, and tumor progression 3 . Uncontrolled M1 activation can cause tissue damage and pathogenesis in inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and hepatitis 4 . In a model of mouse obesity caused by high-fat diet (HFD), the accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) within the white adipose tissue (WAT) involves remodeling of the enlarged WAT and induction of insulin resistance via secreting proinflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and TNF 5, 6 . Moreover, in a viral fulminant hepatitis model, murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection induces a macrophage-dependent cytokine storm of IL-1, TNF, TGF-\u03b2, leukotriene B4, and pro-coagulant fibrinogenlike protein-2 (FGL2), which causes fibrin deposition in the liver and results in acute hepatic necrosis and lethality of susceptible mice 7 . Therefore, attenuation of macrophage-mediated inflammation is a plausible strategy for treating inflammatory disorders.",

            "text": "The regulation of macrophage activation has been extensively studied, with evidence suggesting the involvement of multiple intracellular signaling regulators, including membrane molecules, small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs and epigenetic-associated mechanisms 8 . Evidence from metabolic screening and microarray analyses shows that LPS-activated macrophages have alterations in mitochondrial metabolites, indicating that reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism may be involved in the regulation of macrophage activation 9, 10 . For example, NAD + , as a mitochondrial intermediate metabolite, can inhibit inflammation through inactivating transcription factor NF-\u03baB 11, 12 . Conversely, succinate, another important mitochondrial metabolite, accumulates in LPS-activated macrophages and promotes the transcription of Il1b by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) 13 . Moreover, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and trigger bioprocessing of proinflammatory cytokines including pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 in macrophages 14, 15 . Therefore, inhibition of autophagy, which impairs the removal of ROS-generating mitochondria and causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion, attenuates glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity 16 . Additionally, mtROS can induce M1 activation through activating NF-\u03baB and stabilizing HIF-1\u03b1 17, 18 . Therefore, suppression of mtROS secretion can mitigate pathogenesis in alcoholic steatohepatitis and reduce lethality in endotoxin-mediated fulminant hepatitis 19 . Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism during macrophage activation are unclear.",

            "text": "V-set immunoglobulin-domain-containing 4 (VSIG4) is a membrane protein belonging to complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily (CRIg) 20, 21 . By binding complement component C3b, VSIG4 mediates clearance of C3bopsonized pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus 21 . The expression of VSIG4 is restricted to tissue macrophages, including peritoneal macrophages and liverresidential Kupffer cells. Moreover, VSIG4 marks a subset of macrophages that associates with diabetes resistance 22 . VSIG4 can functionally inhibit IL-2 production and T-cell proliferation by binding an unidentified T-cell ligand or receptor 20 . Interestingly, a VSIG4-Fc fusion protein seems to protect against development of experimental arthritis 23 , experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis 24 , and immune-mediated liver injuries 25 , suggesting that VSIG4 can deliver anti-inflammatory signals. Here, we show that VSIG4 antagonizes activation signals in macrophages by stimulating PI3K/Akt-STAT3 cascades, augmenting expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDK2), and inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity via phosphorylation. Therefore, VSIG4 restricts pyruvate metabolism in the mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), resulting in suppression of mtROS secretion and M1 differentiation. Conversely, Vsig4 or Pdk2 deficiency enhances macrophage activation. Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to HFD-induced obesity in association with insulin resistance. These mice manifest with more severe liver damage and mortality as a result of MHV-3 infection, probably owing to overloading of macrophagemediated inflammation in vivo. Interestingly, forced overexpression of Vsig4 ameliorates MHV-3-induced viral fulminant hepatitis. These data identify an inhibitory function of VSIG4 in macrophage-mediated inflammation.",

For this, agematched C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice were fed a HFD.

However, no significant differences of body masses between the two groups fed a normal chow diet (NCD) (Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Analytical microCT (\u03bcCT) imaging revealed an increase in fat mass throughout the bodies of the Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice, with substantially more abundant visceral fat (Fig. 1b) . Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice also manifested with significant increases in abdominal wall fat and perirenal fat compared to the WT controls. In parallel, we also observed a substantial increase in the serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid, which correlated to increases in body fat in Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice (Fig. 1c) .

Moreover, the 5-h-fasting insulin levels were also substantially elevated (Fig. 1f ). An oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) illustrated that Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice had significantly higher serum levels of glucose and insulin in response to the glucose load compared to their WT littermate controls, suggesting a severely impaired glucose metabolism (Fig. 1g) . Nevertheless, the blood glucose metabolism was similar between the two groups under NCD conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 1b, c) . The insulin tolerance test (ITT) also indicated the existence of a significantly more resistance in Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice compared to the WT controls (Fig. 1g) . Additionally, as compared to WT controls, western blot analyses revealed that Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice had diminished phosphorylation of IRS-1 (p-IRS-1) and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt ser473 ) in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), muscle and liver tissues after administrated with insulin (Fig. 1h) .

Although Vsig4 deficiency did not seem to affect the basal expression level of these factors before viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 3 ), qRT-PCR data showed that MHV-3 infection super-induced Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 PEMs to express Fgl2, Tnf, Il-1\u03b2, and Il-6 ( Fig. 2e) . Flow cytometric data also confirmed at protein levels that inflammatory cytokines like pro-IL1-\u03b2, TNF, and IL-6, were dramatically increased in virus-infected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 PEMs (Fig. 2f) , suggesting Vsig4 deficiency promotes macrophage-derived inflammation in vivo. Consistent with this, Vsig4 deficiency in liver Kupffer cells also resulted in higher levels of these factors deposited in the infected liver tissues, as detected by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 2e) , western blot (Fig. 2g) , and immunohistochemistry ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Therefore, dramatically higher levels of these proinflammatory cytokines were accumulated in the virusinfected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 serum (Fig. 2h) . Finally, Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice responded with severe fibrinogen formation, leading to increased liver coagulation and necrosis post infection ( Supplementary  Fig. 4 ). VSIG4 has been described to be a negative regulator of Tcell activation 20 , nevertheless, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IFN-\u03b3), and the expression of activated markers (CD25 and CD69) from CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells in 72 h of MHV-3-infected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 livers was similar to their WT controls ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). These results clearly demonstrate that Vsig4 deficiency exacerbates macrophage-mediated inflammation, which deteriorates MHV-3 virus-induced FH.",

This was validated by the existence of higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF, and IL-6 protein in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 PEM cultures compared to the WT counterparts (Fig. 3b ).

To investigate the molecular mechanisms for VSIG4mediated macrophage activation, we constructed a platform using VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells to test the dependence of macrophage activation on VSIG4. Inspired by recent studies showing that cell metabolism has an important function in supporting macrophage activation and polarization 31 , we measured cell metabolism thereafter. Figure 4a shows that VSIG4 did not affect LPSinduced glucose uptake. However, it inhibited lactate, pyruvate and acelyl-CoA accumulation after 6 h of LPS administration. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in the macrophages was then investigated, although VSIG4 did not affect oxygen consumption under normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6a , b), it appeared to drastically downregulate oxygen consumption after LPS exposure, both in basal and (h) maximal OCR (Fig. 4b, c) , implying that VSIG4 inhibits mitochondrial oxidation during macrophage activation. It is believed that glucose oxidation via the mitochondrial electron transport chain is a major source of mtROS upon cells undergoing aerobic metabolism 32 . The fact that VSIG4 inhibited mitochondrial oxidation led us to investigate the status of mtROS, which can induce macrophage M1 activation through activating NF-\u03baB and stabilizing HIF-1\u03b1 17 . Compared to the controls, flow cytometry showed that VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells had a significantly less mtROS secretion, especially in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 4d) . Conversely, LPS exposure caused increased mtROS secretion in Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 PEMs in vitro (Fig. 4e) . Moreover, both ATMs from Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice and PEMs isolated from MHV-3-infected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had higher levels of mtROS than their WT littermates (Fig. 4f) . Inhibition of mtROS production by using diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI) can efficiently block LPSinduced IL-6 secretion from both RAW246.7 and VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4g ). This implies that VSIG4 inhibits macrophage M1 activation mainly by reducing pyruvate oxidation and mtROS generation.",

            "text": "VSIG4 promotes DK2 by activating PI3K/Akt-STAT3. To address the underlying mechanism of VSIG4 promotes PDK2 upregulation in macrophages, we focused on the PI3K-Akt signaling machinery in consideration of the fact that this pathway is essential for cellular metabolism, in addition to other functions such as cell growth, survival etc. 34 . Western blotting data showed that Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 PEMs and BMDMs had obviously decreased in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6a) . However, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of VSIG4 in RAW264.7 cells resulted in higher p-Akt ser473 expression compared to mock-infected controls (Fig. 6b) , suggesting that VSIG4 transfers a feedback signal, licensing macrophages for Akt activation. To identify the functional motifs of VSIG4 that are responsible for augmenting Akt phosphorylation, we created a series of point and truncation mutants of the molecule and tested their activity in affecting Akt activation. The data from probing with p-Akt ser473 suggested that the c-terminal residues 267-280 aa of VSIG4 were critical for p-PDEH-E1\u03b1 S300 /Mito tracker/DAPI IL-6 (ng/ml) TNF (ng/ml) mediating Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6b) . Several families of kinases phosphorylate both serine and threonine residues in target substrates, thus result in three dimensional changes of the protein structure and thereby alter its enzymatic activity or affects its ability to interact with other proteins 35 . There are two serine residues (Ser 273 and Ser 276 ) and two threonine residues (Thr 270 and Thr 274 ) in the c-terminal 267-280 residues of VSIG4, and further assessment revealed that mutation of Thr 270 , Ser 273 , and Ser 276 , but not Thr 274 , to Ala respectively, could successfully inhibited LPS-caused Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells, thus prevented PDK2 upregulation (Fig. 6c) , suggesting Thr 270 , Ser 273 , and Ser 276 residues of VSIG4 play essential role in mediating PDK2 expression. The direct involvement of Akt in modulating PDK2 expression was demonstrated by showing that treating VSIG4 + Raw264.7 cells with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 (Fig. 6d) or the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 (Fig. 6e) , all resulted in typical downregulation of p-Akt and PDK2. These combined data suggest that VSIG4 triggers PDK2 upregulation by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) have demonstrated that the Pdk2 promoter region has two binding sites for the signal transduction and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) 36 , which provides a basis for analyzing the signaling pathways responsible for VSIG4-PI3K/ Akt-induced PDK2 upregulation. Interestingly, we found that both the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 (Fig. 6e) , and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 (Fig. 6f) , could successfully inhibit LPS-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (p-STAT3) in VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 was also able to impair LPSinduced p-STAT3 expression in VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells, thus resulting in PDK2 downregulation (Fig. 6g) . Conversely, silenced Stat3 expression in VSIG4 + RAW264.7 cells by specific shRNA also decreased basal PDK2 expression (Fig. 6h) . Furthermore, using ChIP-qPCR, we found that LPS induces p-STAT3 recruitment to one of the two putative binding sites at the \u22121,298 bp but not the \u22122,934 bp of Pdk2 promoter region, and the present of VSIG4 signaling markedly promotes this recruitment (Fig. 6i) . Taken together, these data show that VSIG4 induces PDK2 expression via activating the PI3K/ Akt-STAT3 signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Macrophage activation relies on metabolic adaptation in response to the surrounding micro-environmental stimuli. Macrophage plasticity determines its biological functions in immunity, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis. Defining the mechanisms regulating macrophage metabolic patterns is critical for understanding the pathology of inflammatory disorders and developing therapeutic interventions 2 . We here demonstrate that VSIG4, a B7 family-related protein that is expressed specifically in resting macrophages, is able to inhibit macrophage activation by reprogramming mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. Vsig4 deficiency apparently sways macrophage towards activation upon LPS exposure in vitro. Conversely, overexpression of Vsig4 suppresses M1 gene expression and reduces LPS-induced pyruvate oxidation and mtROS secretion by RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, Vsig4 deficiency affects the outcomes of inflammatory disorders in animal models. For instance, Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to develop HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit markedly higher mortality over MHV-3 viral infection, clearly due to the exacerbated macrophage-dependent inflammation in vivo. Finally and the most notably, the anti-inflammatory function of VSIG4 has been validated by forced overexpression of VSIG4 in vivo, for which we show that excessive epigenetic VSIG4 dampens liver tissue inflammation and protects the susceptible mice from MHV-3 virus-induced FH. These studies demonstrate that VSIG4 inhibits macrophage M1-associated inflammatory pathogenesis. It has long been known that ROS plays essential roles in immune responses of macrophages and neutrophils to pathogens. The bacteria killing capability of activated macrophage and neutrophils is due to reduction in cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases activity that results in production of superoxide during the respiratory burst. On the other hand, over production of ROS actively participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and thyroiditis through activating the inflammatory signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), NF-\u03baB, and guanylate cyclase 38 . ROS comes from various sources, such as peroxisomes, ubiquinone, activities of cytosolic enzymes and uncoupled nitric oxide synthases. However, recent data identify that mitochondria are a major source of physiological intracellular ROS that drives inflammation 39 . mtROS can be sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation 15 . Therefore, high levels of mtROS in vivo would impair glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity 16 , and it probably explains why exaggerated macrophage activation promotes pathogenesis of MHV-3-mediated hepatitis 29 . Alternatively, mtROS also activates NF-\u03baB and stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1, by thus it increases the activities of these two transcriptional factors leading to upregulation of macrophage M1 genes 18 . Here, we show that VSIG4 can inhibit pyruvate/acetyl-CoA conversation in RAW264.7 cells, leading to limitation of oxygen consumption (Fig. 4a-d) . Interestingly, decreasing mitochondrial oxidation also leads to the inhibition of LPS-induced mtROS secretion, along with restriction of Il1b, Il6, and Tnf gene transcription and CD40 upregulation (Fig. 3) . Moreover, PEMs isolated from MHV-3infected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 mice or ATMs collected from HFD-fed Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese animals all exhibited with more mtROS secretion in vivo as compared to WT littermates (Fig. 4f) . Similar to previous studies 40 , inhibition of mtROS activity by DPI successfully prevented LPS-mediated IL-6 production (Fig. 4g) . These data suggest that VSIG4 inhibits macrophage activation via posing restriction on mitochondrial oxidation and mtROS secretion. mtROS derives from pyruvate metabolism during OXPHOS in the mitochondria, in which the conversion of cytosolic pyruvate into mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is partially regulated by the activity of PDH 41 . PDH activity is enhanced via its dephosphorylation by phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP), and inducing PDP1 expression has been shown to promote mitochondrial OXPHOS, mtROS production and M1 gene expression 19 . Conversely, PDK-mediated phosphorylation of the PDH-E1\u03b1 subunit at 3 serine sites, including Ser 232 , Ser 293 , and Ser 300 , appeared to cause PDH suppression 42 . Recent studies have shown that PDK/PDH axis essentially controls cytokine secretion in macrophages. For example, overexpression of PDK2 inhibits radiation-induced cytokine expression 43 , whereas macrophages from Pdk2/4-deficient animals appear to produce less IL-1\u03b2 and TNF in association with a low level of lactic acid 44 . We here identify that the VSIG4-dependent inhibition of macrophage M1 activation relies on PDK2. LPS stimulation resulted in augmentation of mtROS secretion and inflammatory gene expression in Pdk2 silenced RAW264.7 cells and Pdk2 deficient BMDMs (Fig. 5h-j, Supplementary Fig. 8 ). In agreement, overexpression of Pdk2 results in opposite effects (Fig. 5h-j) . Along with previous work suggesting that PDK1 is involved in promoting aerobic glycolysis in macrophages 45 , these combined data highlight a signaling pathway that governs the fate of macrophages differentiation and function and Pdk status is involved in mediating metabolic programs for balancing between glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Substantial evidence demonstrates that obesity is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease 46 . In obesity, adipocytes can release proinflammatory mediator like CC chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, and monocyte chemoattractant molecule (MCP)-1, which induce the recruitment of ATMs 47 . ATM secretes proinflammatory cytokines and forms the inflammatory circuit which blocks the insulin action in adipocytes and leads to insulin resistance 5 . Here we demonstrate that ATMs isolated from HFDfed Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice have higher levels of proinflammatory factors such as TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 1i-k) . It was elucidated that proinflammatory cytokines promote obesity-associated insulin resistance through activating inflammatory signaling pathways, including the stress-responsive c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) and AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b12 (AMPK\u03b12), inhibitor of \u03baB kinase, and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) as well as MAPKp38, collectively causing inhibition of serine/threonine phosphorylation of the docking protein IRS-1 [48] [49] [50] . In agreement with previous studies, we found that Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 obese mice exhibit exacerbated insulin resistance along with diminished p-IRS-1 and p-Akt ser473 in the WAT and the liver tissues (Fig. 1h) , indicating that Vsig4 deficiency eliminates the negative control signals, thus allowing ATMs to produce proinflammatory cytokines and switching on HFD-associated insulin tolerance in vivo.",

The MHV-3 virus provokes a mouse strain-associated severe liver disease that has been used as a model for investigating human viral fulminant hepatitis. This exacerbation of macrophage-dependent cytokine storm directly causes hepatic necrosis and induces lethality in susceptible mouse strains 7 . In support, normal induction of macrophage apoptosis can appropriately control local liver tissue fibrinogen deposition and local tissue injuries in this fulminant hepatitis model 52 . As expected, we have found that MHV-3 infection super-induces production of a panel of inflammatory cytokines from Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, and the virus-infected mice exhibit with more severe liver necrosis and high mortality (Fig. 2) . In contrast, forced expression of Vsig4 in susceptible mice provides significant protection against MHV-3-induced fulminant hepatitis (Fig. 8) . These combined results demonstrate that VSIG4 functionally contributes to limiting macrophage M1-associated inflammation, and its deficiency can cause over inflammatory disorders.",

            "text": "Identification of mediators that regulate Vsig4 expression will bring insights into understanding the inflammatory response in the host. The epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, have recently been shown to mediate gene silencing 53 . DNA methylation is a covalent modifications, in which DNA methyltransferase catalyze cytosine methylation using S-adenosyl methionine as a methyl donor 54 . It has been reported that the expression of tumor suppressor genes in several human cancers were inhibited upon DNA methylation at their CpG sites within the promoters 37, 55 . We here found that Vsig4 mRNA and protein were decreased dramatically in PEMs that were treated with inflammatory factors in vitro (Fig. 7c-e) . Conversely, blocking Dnmt3a activity by the inhibitor, 5-aza-2\u02b9deoxycytidine, could effectively prevent proinflammatory factors induced Vsig4 downregulation (Fig. 7e) . Further studies demonstrated that the luciferase activity of the M.SssI-methylated Vsig4 promoter (-840/+1) was reduced by 53% comparing to the unmethylated controls, and proinflammatory stimuli were unable to further inhibit the promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells transfected with the M.SssI-methylated Vsig4 promoter constructs (Fig. 7f) . We also found that some CpG sites in Vsig4 promoter region (like CpG at -374 bp site) were methylated by proinflammatory stimuli as detected by using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform ( Supplementary Fig. 10 , Supplementary  Table 1 ). Together, these data suggest that proinflammatory factors repress Vsig4 gene transcription through inducing Dnmt3a activity, causing fast methylation of Vsig4 promoter region, for which CpG at -374 bp site, probably with other CpG islands within the Vsig4 promoter region, plays a critical role in regulating Vsig4 transcription.",

Injection of soluble VSIG4-Ig protein causes a reduction in IFN-\u03b3 production by antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and down-modulates Thdependent IgG responses in vivo 20 . Additionally, administration of VSIG4-Ig protein prolonged mouse survival in a ConAinduced hepatitis model and protected against the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases 25, 56 . One of the explanations for this effect is that VSIG4 binds to an as-yet-unidentified inhibitory receptor/ligand on T cells. Alternatively, the surface VSIG4 on macrophages and CR1/CR3 on T cells bind to the same multimeric C3b or iC3b molecules, thus triggering signals to suppress T-cell activation 57 . Here, we showed that the secretion of cytokines in T cells that isolated from liver tissues of 72 h post MHV-3-infected Vsig4 \u2212/\u2212 animals were similar to their WT counterparts ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , implicating VSIG4 does not affect T-cell activation in our models. Conversely, we demonstrate that VSIG4 delivers negative feedback signals to macrophages, resulting in PI3K-Akt-STAT3 dependent PDK2 upregulation, and finally impedes mtROS-dependent M1 macrophage activation, suggesting VSIG4 negatively controls macrophage activation. However, microbeads-C3b did not affect the expression of PDK2 from LPS-activated VSIG4 + THP-1 cells. Additionally, the expression of PDK2 and the secretion of cytokines like IL-6 as well as IL1-\u03b2 were still downregulated in LPS-stimulated C3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Figs. 3h, 6j) , these combined data suggest that inhibition of macrophage activation by VSIG4 is C3b independent. Further studies are needed to identify the potential interacting partners for VSIG4.",
