            "text": "Rationale: There is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), and treatment approaches are highly variable. One approach is a temporary tongue-lip adhesion (TLA) that acts as a temporizing measure while the mandible continues to grow and is usually taken down at 1 year of age. Patient concerns: Side effects of prolonged tongue-lip adhesion and optimal workup and treatment of persistent OSA in the setting of a tongue-lip adhesion. Diagnoses: Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tongue-lip adhesion (TLA). Interventions: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO), adenotonsillectomy, and tongue-lip adhesion takedown. Outcomes: Resolution of OSA. Lessons: This case puts into question the efficacy of isolated TLA in infants with Pierre Robin sequence and OSA, and places emphasis on the importance of considering an earlier workup of other potential causes of obstruction and the potential need for MDO as a primary or adjunctive approach to treatment.

            "text": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a syndrome defined by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and upper airway compromise with or without cleft palate. It was first documented in 1923, and is estimated to occur in approximately 0.5 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births. [2] The etiology is still unclear, but about one-third of PRS patients have associated genetic syndromes, most commonly Stickler syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome. Hypoplasia of the mandible is thought to occur before the ninth week of development, forcing a posterior displacement of the tongue, which, in turn, can prevent closure of the palate leading to cleft palate. [3, 4] The most significant issues that present in infants with PRS are upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties, which can lead to a failure to thrive and poor growth patterns that emerge over time, particularly before 10 months of age. [5] Notably, there is a high prevalence of OSA in this population, impacting neurocognitive development as well. [6, 7] This highlights a need for early, effective, and definitive intervention.",

            "text": "Clinical signs to evaluate for upper airway obstruction in infants with PRS include stridor, labored breathing, diaphoresis, apnea, and restlessness. It is optimal for an experienced physician to assess for these over an adequate period of time while the patient is asleep, awake, or during feeding. An objective evaluation of respiratory compromise can include pulse oximetry, carbon dioxide retention, and polysomnography. [5] However, although oximetry is specific for OSA, it is not sensitive for detecting airway obstruction. [8] Thus, an increasing reliance on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in sleep studies has been used to evaluate the overall success of airway management in these patients. [9] Airway management in PRS patients ranges from minimally invasive such as prone or lateral positioning to surgical options such as tracheotomy. Prone/lateral positioning and close observation is the oldest established method and may be effective for PRS patients with only mild airway compromise. However, this method does not relieve airway obstruction for all infants, and it may limitation interaction with the parent from a prone position. Other options for conservative management include noninvasive respiratory support such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive positive pressure, or a nasopharyngeal airway (trumpet). Traditional management of more severe airway compromise has been the tracheotomy. Glossopexy, or the tongue-lip adhesion (TLA), is associated with decreased morbidity and normalized weight gain, including an improvement in lowest oxygen saturation reading by 8.6% in one meta-analysis. [10, 11] It is estimated that airway issues that accompany PRS are expected to improve or resolve as the mandible continues to grow by the age of one, at which time palate repair is typically planned. [1, 15] However, this option has decreased in popularity due to its temporary effectiveness and the frequent need for nutritional support for >1 month and additional surgical procedures. [12] Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is the most common surgical intervention, allowing patients with severe airway compromise to avoid a tracheotomy, and can provide a lasting modification. However, it is also one of the most invasive options. [13] Timing and invasiveness in the treatment of upper airway obstruction in infants with PRS remains expansive and varied. [1] We present a case report of delayed TLA takedown to highlight challenges in the approach to treatment. Ethical approval for this study was not necessary as this is a retroactive single case summary; however, informed consent was given for publication.",

Consequently, the patient's neuromuscular glossal and mandibular alveolar development were seriously impacted. Prolonged TLA resulted in a severely retroclined mandibular alveolus, embedded primary incisors in the floor of the mouth, and a steep dolichofacial mandibular growth pattern as measured by a gonial angle of 160\u00b0 (Fig. 2 ). In addition, TLA and need to overcome apnea caused the patient's open mouth posture. The muscles of mastication were weak from disuse dystrophy because the patient's nutritional intake occurred through a gastronomy tube and from the inability to close the mouth and assume any tooth contact. The weakness of the masticatory muscles coupled with the unbalanced tension of the anterior digastric and masseter muscles at rest contributed to the extremely steep gonial angle resembling that of patients affected by cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. [18, 19] When the patient had returned for dental followup nearly 3 years after the TLA takedown, the position of the mandibular alveolus had significantly improved and three mandibular permanent incisors had erupted in a more upright fashion (Fig. 3) . The TLA takedown contributed to a change in soft tissue equilibrium between tongue and lips whereby the force of the new resting tongue position within the mandibular arch could exert pressure on the lingual surfaces of the incisors and aid in improving the alveolar inclination. These changes can be explained by Moss's functional matrix theory which describes the influence soft tissue has on the growth of bone. [20] There are no studies examining the impact of TLA on teeth, which is possibly due to the short time frame that TLA is typically present. However, future studies should examine if TLA has any adverse effects on occlusion and the development of teeth.",

            "text": "Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a mandibular lengthening technique which is frequently used in the treatment of micrognathia in infants. It can lead to an improvement in respiratory status within a few days and has been shown to significantly decrease severity of OSA in appropriately selected patients. In addition, when compared with TLA, MDO achieves greater airway stability and a more rapid return to full feeding. [1] However, failure rate is estimated between 2% and 9% and is higher in syndromic patients and those over 24 months of age. [17] Indeed, our patient, who meets both of those higher risk criteria, experienced a unilateral distraction failure and delayed adenotonsillar evaluation. The combination of the hypoplastic mandible and glossoptosis found in PRS predisposes this population to significant obstructive sleep apnea during early development. Although TLA prevents tongue retrusion, it does not address the anatomical obstruction from micrognathia, which is modified with MDO.",
