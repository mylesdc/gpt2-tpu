A major limitation of sequence homology-based identification for highly divergent microorganisms is the short length of reads generated by most highly parallel sequencing technologies. Short reads require a high level of sequence similarities to annotated genes to confidently predict gene function or homology. Such recognition of highly divergent homologues can be improved by reference-free (de novo) assembly of short overlapping sequence reads into larger contigs. We describe an ensemble strategy that integrates the sequential use of various de Bruijn graph and overlap-layout-consensus assemblers with a novel partitioned sub-assembly approach. We also proposed new quality metrics that are suitable for evaluating metagenome de novo assembly. We demonstrate that this new ensemble strategy tested using in silico spike-in, clinical and environmental NGS datasets achieved significantly better contigs than current approaches.",

This powerful technology has numerous applications in diagnosis of infectious diseases, environmental surveillance, metagenomic analysis of human and animal microbiomes, and novel pathogen discovery (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Us-ing bioinformatics, microbial sequences are identified by comparing millions of NGS reads to sequences in publicly available reference databases. One crucial step in the analysis is de novo metagenome assembly of short overlapping reads into longer contigs. Successful assembly can generate long contigs or even complete genomes, which has two major advantages: (i) enhance the sensitivity to detect novel pathogens with only weak sequence homology to known pathogens by generation of long contigs (6) ; and (ii) reduce the cost and labor needed to manually extend new microbial genomes with polymerase chain recation.",

            "text": "Many assemblers have been recently categorized in a review by Miller et al. (7) . One school of assemblers such as AMOS (8) , CAP3 (9) , Celera (10), VCAKE (11) and Newbler (12) use traditional olconsensus (OLC) algorithms which identify overlaps between various long reads and subsequently merge the read fragments into longer sequences. This approach requires pairwise evaluation of a large number of reads, which is computationally intensive. Another group of assemblers, such as SOAPdenovo2 (13) , ABySS (14) , Velvet (15) , MetaVelvet (16) and ALLPATHS-LG (17) speed up assembly by using de Bruijn graph (DBG) algorithms. DBG methods leverage graph theory by using strings of a particular length (k-mer) to generate a sequence graph where each node is a (k-1)-mer and each edge is a k-mer which connects suffix and prefix nodes. For example, a 4-mer edge ATTG in a DBG connects prefix node ATT and suffix node TTG. To generate a DBG, each read is mapped as a path of k-mers, one base at a time. Sequence redundancy is naturally handled by the graph without affecting the number of nodes. Much greater speed over OLC assemblers is thus achieved by the DBG algorithm by avoiding pairwise comparison of all reads, which can be highly redundant. Assemblers have also been developed for specific genomic applications, such as Trinity (18) , a DBGbased de novo transcriptome assembler, Masurca (19) a hy-brid assembler that combines the concept of DBG and OLC methods and IDBA-UD, an assembler designed for uneven metagenomic applications (20) . In addition to DBG and OLC approaches, other assembly algorithms have been reported, including MIRA4 (21) and Omega (22) .",

The key lessons learned from these projects are that there is a lack of consensus from assemblies generated by different assemblers, and that there are no universal winners across different datasets. In many cases, the assemblers are able to generate good-sized contigs up to hundreds of kb. However, the tested datasets focused on NGS assembly of large human, animal or bacterial genomes from pure samples and cultures and at a high depth of coverage, whereas metagenomic samples present greater challenges because they contain a complex mixture of sequence fragments from multiple viruses, bacteria and animal/human host DNA. Based on published data from our group (1) and others (26) , DBG assemblers rarely generate contigs more than a few kb in real-world metagenomic samples. Given the lack of a 'best' assembler, the Assemblathon papers advised against relying solely on a single assembler for any given dataset of interest. One recent paper presents a tool for comparing the performance of assemblers by scoring each assembly based on the consistency between assemblies and input reads and read pairs (27) . However, it is still not clear how to optimally integrate results from multiple assemblers and derive better contigs based on a combined approach.",

In our previous report (1), we found empirically that a sequential DBG and OLC method that also incorporates partitioning was more efficient at contig assembly of viral genomes from metagenomic NGS data. Here, we formally extend these findings by rigorous comparison of common DBG and OLC assemblers and show that a two-step ensemble assembly strategy generates contigs of much higher quality than those achieved from single assemblers alone. The ensemble strategy is thus directly applicable for assembly of small viral, bacterial and eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes from a wide variety of NGS metagenomic datasets as well as from pure cultures.",

We use 's', 'a' and 'v', to represent partitioned assembly for SOAPdenovo2, ABySS and MetaVelvet respectively. Figure 1C outlines the ensemble assembly strategy, which can be viewed as a 3-step process. The first step is to perform S, A, V and their corresponding partitioned versions s, a, v individually. The second step is to combine one or more output contigs from the first step and use a length filter (e.g. 300 bp used here) to only retain longer contigs above a certain threshold. The purpose of the length filtering is to eliminate smaller contig fragments that can significantly slow down the final step. The final step is to apply O or C on the combined contigs to generate final contigs. We also tested whether using T or M at the second assembly step can produce performance advantages, although T and M are technically not OLC assemblers. The ensemble assembly algorithms are labeled by their components. For example, SC represents S followed by C; SAVaO represents first combining the outputs of S, A, V and a, and then applying O as the last step.",

Furthermore, N50 and N95 do not specifically address assembly of small target genomes within a complex metagenomic background (a 'needle-in-a-haystack' problem). Direct measurements of the sizes of contigs aligning to known target microbial genomes and of the degree of misassembly are more relevant for metagenomic samples.

With setA, setB, setF and setG, all containing in silico BASV reads at >20\u00d7 coverage, nearly 100% of the genome could be obtained for some of the assembly combinations. With datasets at <15\u00d7 coverage, none of the methods produced contigs >5 kb in length. Notably, SsC, SsO, VvO and VvC did not perform nearly as well as AaO and AaC, suggesting that partitioning is most advantageous when using A. Using M as the final assembler (SAVaM) appeared to generate slightly worse contigs than using C (SAVaC), O (SAVaO) or T(SAVaT), although SAVaM was also slightly faster than the others ( Figure 2C and E) . Although the number and distribution of BASV 'spike-in' reads were identical for the nasal and stool datasets, de novo assembly of BASV in the nasal dataset was consistently better than in the stool dataset, indicating that a less complex background (as is the case for respiratory secretions relative to stool) is a favorable factor for assembly. All of the assembly combinations yielded very low levels of misassemblies on analysis of the in silico-spiked virus datasets, with a chimera index consistently <0.15%, except for a few datasets analyzed using W and T in which the chimera index was as high as 0.8% ( Figure 2D) .",

We executed the components of ensemble assemblers sequentially on a single server and recorded the total run-time for all datasets ( Figure 2E ). In practice, however, the timing performance of an ensemble assembly method can be improved by executing the first-step assemblies (A, S, V, M, a, s, v) in parallel, provided that multiple servers are available. To test whether the second OLC assembly step is an execution bottleneck, the relative percentage time spent on the second assembly step was calculated ( Figure 2F ).

The assembler T, however, performs surprisingly well for this dataset in terms of MACR and C1000, unlike what was observed in the 'in silico-virus spiked' datasets ( Figure 2B and C). The best assembly strategies, except T individually, were all found to be ensemble assembly combinations with partitioning or including M or both. One of the best ensemble assembly methods, SAVaC, produced a median MACRP of 17.5%, a 7fold improvement over S alone (2.4%). Heat map analysis of the MACPR parameter for the top 20 viruses with contig alignments ( Figure 3B ) showed the superiority of the ensemble assembly strategies SAVaC and AaO (>20% of the target genome assembled for eight viruses) over the individual DBG assemblers (>20% of the target genome assembled for only two viruses). M, T and combinations with M or T showed an elevated level of chimeric assembly as compared to strategies using other assemblers, in which the chimeras index for most viruses was <1% ( Figure 3C ). Timing analysis revealed that the ensemble combination AaO was almost two-fold faster than SAVaC, while maintaining almost equivalent contig quality for this dataset (Figure 3A and B). However, the three slowest ensemble assembly strategies were also found to use O, suggesting that O may not scale well with the larger input sizes generated using multiple DBG assembly combinations (SAVO and SAVaO) or inefficient DBG assemblers (SsO) ( Figure 3D ). For this large dataset with 20 million reads, the percentage time spent on OLC step is 29% for SAVaC and 4% for AaO respectively ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the ensemble assemblers are relatively efficient in their handling of larger datasets.",

Similar to the C1000 and MACP distributions in the 'in silico-virus spiked' datasets and the 'pooled virus standard' dataset (Figures 2 and 3) , the strategies that employ M or T generated the largest contig alignments ( Figure 4A and B) . However, these strategies also resulted in the highest level of misassemblies, with significant increases in the average chimera index to 5% or higher (Figure 4C ). Ensemble assembly strategies without M or T, such as SAVaC, showed much lower levels of misassembly, with a chimera index typically under 5%. Similar to the other datasets, the assembly performance of the individual DBG Note that certain assemblers such as G, W, X and SAVaM failed to finish in many of the datasets due to software issues. assemblers was limited, with only 3-10% of target genomes being successfully de novo assembled versus >20% of target genomes for the top ensemble strategies. For example, heat map analysis of multiple microbial genome targets confirmed the superiority of ensemble strategies such as SAVaC and SAVTaC ( Figure 4A and B) . Notably, SAVaC achieved a C1000 metric of >80% in four of nine target genomes, versus only zero or one of nine genomes for the S, A, V and M algorithms run individually. The timing data ( Figure 4D ) showed that using M individually or as a component in the first assembly takes a significantly longer time to execute than other methods. While the timing differences were not as pronounced as in the 'pooled virus standard' dataset, the AaO strategy, as well as the related AaC and VvO strategies, were overall faster than SAVaC but resulted in the generation of shorter contigs. The percentage of time spent in the OLC step was also found to be acceptable, with average case below 50%, in these very diverse metagenomic datasets ( Figure 4E ).",

For individual assemblers, I and T clearly produced the best C1000 NR among individual assemblers; whereas A, S V W, G produced poor sized contigs ( Figure 5A ). Ensemble strategies including partitioning or M or T produced the best C1000 NR . The MACR NR is highly correlated with C1000 NR ( Figure 5D ). T, M, I and ensemble methods using them as a component, however, are among the worst assembler in Accuracy NR ( Figure 5B ). M and methods with M as a component, are the slowest (Figure 5E ), indicating they are not suitable for time-critical diagnosis applications. According to CPM which measures overall contig qualities, the highest ranked assemblers were SAVaC, SAVTaC, SAVaO (Figure 5C ). The best individual assembler is I but its CPM is still significantly lower than the best ensemble assemblers. SAVTaC achieved very high C1000 NR and MACR NR , but its Accuracy NR and Speed NR were below average. SAVaC and SAVaO achieved better Accuracy NR and competitive C1000 NR and MACR NR . Figure 6 shows the relationship of the normalized measures. Figure 6A shows that assemblers fall in a curved belt, indicating a reciprocal relationship between Accuracy NR and C1000 NR . Ensemble methods with M or T as a component in the first assembly had the largest C1000 NR and poorest Accuracy NR , suggesting these assemblers may be overly aggressive in assembly of larger contigs. On the side of the curve were DBG assemblers which may be overly conservative in extending contigs. SAVaO and SAVaC are closest to the ideal upper right corner, indicating they achieved balance overall performance. Figure 6B shows that C1000 NR is negatively correlated with Speed NR . C1000 NR and MACR NR are both contig size measures and they are closely correlated ( Figure 6C ). Figure 6D shows positive correlation between Accuracy NR and Speed NR , indicating faster assemblers are generally conservative and thus generate lower level of chimeric contigs. Table 3 compares MACR for DBG assemblers A, V, S with our ensemble assemblers, AaO and SAVaC across all datasets. It was observed that SAVaC produced MACR that are 7.3, 11.9 and 13.6 fold as large as those produced by A, V and S. SAVaC also produced contigs that are 60% larger than AaO on average.

By benchmarking of the strategy using test datasets that include both in silico-generated and 'real-life' clinical and environmental metagenomic data, we demonstrated that ensemble assembly strategies produced accurate contigs that were significantly larger than those obtained by individual assemblers alone. Furthermore, the degree of misassembly for most of the ensemble strategies generally remained below 5%. Taken together, our data suggests that the best ensemble assembly strategy among those tested may be SAVaC (SoapDenovo2, ABySS, MetaVelvet, partitioned ABySS followed by Cap3), with AaO (Abyss, partitioned AbySS followed by Minimo) or AaC (Abyss, partitioned AbySS followed by Cap3) a reasonable alternative if fast execution time is of importance. Although the performance of some individual assemblers, such as M (Mira4) and T (Trinity) was comparable, the percentage of chimeric contigs was also high, and M (Mira4) was also computationally slow relative to the other assembly methods. IDBA-UD may be the best with respect to speed and contig alignment size among individual assemblers, despite its higher percentage of chimeras. Reads that were identical from nucleotide positions 5-45 were considered clonal reads, and only one random copy of clonal reads was retained. The other clonal sequences were replaced with sequence 'A' as a place holder; thus the original order of the paired-end files was preserved. dedup input1.fastq deduped2.fastq (The program dedup is provided with the main program) 3.

Low-quality sequences were trimmed using a Phred quality score 10 as the threshold. The poor performance of individual DBG assemblers in general for metagenome assembly can likely be attributed to (i) the use of k-mers instead of single reads which discards key layout and position information and (ii) the optimization of DBG methods for assembly of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes from pure cultures and not for metagenome assembly. Although the latest version of V (MetaVelvet/Velvet) was specifically developed for metagenomes by decomposing initial graphs into subgraphs representing isolated species (16) , it did not perform well individually in our testing. To our surprise, Celera (W), despite being an OLC assembler, generated poor, small contigs and the highest percentage of chimeric sequences. Another recently published assembler, G (Omega) (22) , neither a DBG assembler nor an OLC assembler, did not perform well in the 'in silico-virus spiked' datasets ( Figure 2 ). The MaSuRCA assembler (X) (19) , which is a recent hybrid DBG and OLC assembler, did not generate large contigs as we would expected.",

Our ensemble strategy leverages fast DBG assemblers to quickly reduce the original NGS reads to a much smaller, non-redundant set of intermediate contigs. Our results suggest that partitioning is an indispensable part of the ensemble strategy. The use of a partitioning method produces additional distinct, albeit short contigs that can be used to fill gaps in coverage. The much slower OLC assemblers are used only in the final step to extend the contigs, thereby achieving much longer contigs than possible with DBG or OLC assemblers alone. Because the number of contigs is typically only 1-3% of the number of raw reads, the timing for the second OLC step is usually not a performance bottleneck. We note, however, that a second round of OLC assembly has the potential to introduce additional misassemblies, and indeed, the misassembly level of the ensemble strategies, although remaining <5% in general, is still higher than that of most of the individual DBG assemblers.",

Thus, rapid and efficient computational subtraction of human host reads (1) will likely remain a critical step in pathogen assembly from metagenomic data. Our analysis of the 'in silico-virus spiked' datasets also shows that an average sequence depth of at least 20\u00d7 (10\u00d7 in each direction for paired-end sequencing) is needed to recover 100% of a target genome from metagenomic NGS data. The actual minimum sequence depth required may be higher than 20\u00d7 due to biases in the actual coverage achieved. Finally, although we have demonstrated the utility of the ensemble assembly strategy for the relatively small genomes corresponding to viruses, bacteria and the mitochondrial genome of the eukaryotic pathogen N. fowleri, this approach may not be suitable for much larger eukaryotic genomes, mainly because OLC assemblers such as Minimo and Cap3 will likely be unable to handle the increased computational load. As datasets become increasingly larger, the OLC assembly step may become the speed bottleneck, since the DBG assemblers and partitioning scheme are amenable to parallel computing with multi-core processors.
