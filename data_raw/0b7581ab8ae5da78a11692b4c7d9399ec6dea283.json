Primers and probes of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR are based on the V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of the three Mycoplasma species. Results: The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR was, as determined by spiking experiments of the Mycoplasma strains in Phosphate Buffered Saline, 300 colony forming units (cfu)/mL for M. dispar, and 30 cfu/mL for M. bovis or M. bovirhinis. The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCRwas, as determined on purified DNA, 10 fg DNA per assay for M. dispar and 100 fg fo rM. bovis and M. bovirhinis. The analytical specificity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was, as determined by testing Mycoplasmas strains (n = 17) and other bacterial strains (n = 107), 100, 98.2 and 99.1% for M. bovis, M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively. The RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was compared with the PCR/DGGE analysis for M. bovis, M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively by testing 44 BALF samples from calves. Conclusion: In conclusion, the RespoCheck PCR assay can be a valuable tool for timely and accurate detection of three Mycoplasma species associated with in bovine respiratory disease.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a global problem causing severe economic losses to the cattle farming industry through mortality, loss of production, and treatment costs [1, 2] . It has a complex etiology that involves various pathogens, host factors, and environmental factors. Viruses such as bovine herpes 1 virus (BoHV-1, parainfluenza virus 3 (PBIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial Virus (BRSV), respiratory bovine coronavirus (BoCoV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in conjunction with stress factors have been implicated as causes of respiratory tract infections of cattle by immunosuppression and damage to the respiratory epithelium [3] . A primary viral infection can be followed by an opportunistic secondary infection with bacteria like Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, or Trueperella pyogenes [2, 4, 5] , but these bacteria could also act as primary pathogen. In addition it has become increasingly clear that Mycoplasmas are important contributors to BRD, either as primary pathogens or in co-infection [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] . M. bovis is the best known Mycoplasma species causing respiratory disease [4, 7] , but also M. dispar and M. bovirhinis have been associated with BRD [2, [9] [10] [11] . M. bovis has not only been identified as a primary or opportunistic pathogen in BRD in beef cattle worldwide, but it has also been implicated in other clinical manifestations in cattle, such as mastitis, otitis, arthritis, and reproductive disorders [7] . M. bovirhinis and M. dispar are regularly isolated from the nasal cavity of cattle with respiratory disease and are usually regarded as an opportunistic pathogen in respiratory diseases [7, 12] .",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from calves with BRD may contain various potential pathogens, but additional antibiotic use in the affected herds can inhibit cultivation and thereby can cause falsenegative test results. In BRD, differential diagnosis of these pathogens with rapid turnaround time procedure is essential to implement appropriate treatment and intervention measures in a timely manner. Rapid detection of these pathogens at the early stage of outbreak can contribute substantially to minimize the spread of infection and increase treatment efficiency. Today quick, highly sensitive and species-specific PCRs are used in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma-associated diseases for M. dispar [14, 15] , M. bovis [4, 16] and M. bovirhinis [17] in BALF or nasal swabs. Combining a 16S Ribosomal DNA PCR with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (PCR/DGGE) enabled the simultaneous detection of mixed Mycoplasma populations, however information about the detection limit in clinical samples is limited [18] . Additionally, a DNA microarray assay was developed for the parallel detection of 37 Mycoplasma species [19] , in which species-specific probes derived from the 23S rRNA and tuf genes were used for species differentiation.",

Primers and probes specific for the bacterial 16S, V3 and V4 regions were based on the Full length, bacterial 16S sequences (50,000 in July 2012) were used from the nuccore database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, USA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore). For M. bovirhinis and M. dispar the nearly full length 16S sequences were used. These sequences and their taxonomic information were used to build an Insigniabased database [22] from which pathogen-specific sequence regions were extracted with special interest for the V3 and V4 region because these sequences are often targeted for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) [23] . Using the identified regions, primers and probes were designed with AlleleID 7.8. (Premier Biosoft, palo Alto, USA). The resulting triplex PCR was designated RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR The specificity of the Mycoplasma primers and probes was also verified against V3-V4 partial sequences of M. flocculare, M. ovipneumonia and M. hyopneumonia.",

With a copy number of 16S rRNA of one or two (https://rrndb.umms.med.umich.edu/) and with a test volume of 5 \u03bcl the lowest concentration which could be detected is around 1-2 cfu/assay. The lowest concentration of M. bovis and M. bovirhinis which could be detected with the RespoCheck triplex for M. bovis, and M. bovirhinis is around 0.5 cfu/assay. From the calculated analytical sensitivity of the M. bovis, M dispar and M. bovirhinis RespoCheck triplex PCR (0.5-2 cfu/assay) we conclude that the RespoCheck triplex PCR has a good analytical sensitivity. It was shown that the use of a pellet from 25 mL BALF after centrifugation instead of not-centrifuged BALF samples increased the analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck triplex PCR assay. In order to determine the analytical specificity of the RespoCheck triplex PCR we analysed the DNAs from panels of Mycoplasma and bacterial strains. In the M. bovis RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR we found a cross-reaction with M. agalactiae. Phylogenetic analyses on 16S rRNA sequences and comparing the 16S rRNA sequences of M. bovis and M. agalactiae [25] at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), we found a close relationship between M. agalactiae and M. bovis, with a 99% nucleotide identity between their 16S rRNA sequences. However, M. bovis causes calf pneumonia, mastitis, and arthritis in cattle [16, 31] , M. agalactiae is the causal agent of contagious agalactia in goats and sheep [32] . Although unusual, M. agalactiae has been detected from cattle samples [33, 34] . Therefore the cross reactivity for M. agalactiae might be a problem for the intended BALF samples in the M. bovis Monitoring for Mycoplasma species in BALF samples through collection and testing of BALF samples by culture is hampered by the fastidious nutritional requirements, lengthy culture of mycoplasmas, and their susceptibility to growth inhibitors. As a consequence, Mycoplasma culture is time-consuming, costly, and requires specific expertise. Moreover, Mycoplasma species may easily be overgrown by bacterial contaminants or by more rapidly growing Mollicutes, notably Acholeplasmas. The PCR/DGGE method of the APHA can differentiate 13 bovine Mycoplasma species [18] including the target Mycoplasmas of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR and in contrary to the RespoCheck can differentiate between M. bovis and M. canis. Additional the PCR/DGGE is capable of detecting mixed cultures, which would have been difficult to detect by culture methods [18] . Therefore we used this method as a reference for determining the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR.",

The transport and storage conditions or differences in DNA preparation of particularly the more diluted BALF samples for the PCR/ DGGE method could have induced a lower sensitivity of the PCR/DGGE analysis. The Ct values of the M. bovis, and M. dispar PCR positive and DGGE positive samples are significant (P < 0.05 Mann Whitney test) lower than the M. bovis, and M. dispar PCR positive DGGE negative samples, which confirms the difference in the analytical sensitivity between the RespoCheck triplex PCR and DGGE analyse. In the M. bovis and M. dispar PCR, we found a 10 fold difference in the Ct values between the DGGE positive/ PCR positive and DGGE negative/ PCR positive samples, which indicates a higher diagnostic sensitivity of M. bovis and M. dispar PCR than the DGGE analyses. Results by DGGE from BALF samples with mixed infections could be reproduced by the triplex PCR, suggesting that there is no significant PCR bias when the triplex PCR is used for Mycoplasma detection in field samples. The PCR has thus a higher analytical sensitivity than the DGGE.",

In addition, DNA from 14 Mycoplasma strains (Table 1) were provided by Prof. Konrad Sachse (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Bundesforschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Tiergesundheit, Jena, Germany). Hundred and seven bacterial isolates, representing 39 different species, were used to evaluate of specificity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR assay (Table 2). These included isolates associated with BRD and isolates associated with other bovine diseases. Prior to testing by PCR, the identity of the isolates was confirmed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS Bruker MALDI Biotyper Microflex, version 3.1 with the reference database version 3.1.66 Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Germany).",

Significant P values are indicated by * PCR. In the M. bovirhinis RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR one false positive reaction was obtained on DNA from M. canis. M.canis can be isolated from the reproductive tract of dogs, but has not been proved to cause disease in dogs. However, it has been shown to cause clinical signs of pneumonia in experimentally challenged calves[35] and M. canis has been isolated from ruminants in Britain[36,37]. Depending on the incidence of M. canis in ruminants, this may give false-positive results in the M. bovirhinis RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR. DNA samples from M. alkalescens and A. axanthun showed high Ct-values (>35) for M. dispar in the RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR, and were therefore classified as false-positive (Ct of 40 cycles or less were considered to be positive). M. alkalescens and M. bovigenitalium are important Mycoplasmas that can infect cattle and cause mastitis, arthritis and respiratory disease[17]. However, in the sequence analyses of the PCR-positive and DGGE-negative M. dispar BALF samples, we did not find any indication for the presence of M. alkascens, underlining the high specificity for M. dispar in the RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR.",
