Eventhough China achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history achieved; health inequality remains endemic in China. Lessons from the effect of market crisis on health equity in Europe and other places has reignited interest in exploring the potential healthcare market aberrations that can trigger distributive injustice in healthcare resource allocation among China's provinces. Recently, many healthcare investors in China have become more concerned about capital preservation, and are responding by abandoning long term investments strategies in healthcare. This investment withdrawal en mass is perceived to be influenced by herding tendencies and can trigger or consolidate endemic health inequality. Methods: Our study simultaneously employs four testing models (two state spaced models and two return dispersion models) to establish the existence of procyclical (herding) behavior among the stocks and its health equity implications. These are applied to a large set of data to compare and contrast results of herd formation among investors in fourteen healthcare sectors in China. Results: The study reveals that apart from the cross sectional standard deviation (CSSD) model, the remaining two models and our augmented state space model yields significant evidence of herding in all subsectors of the healthcare market. We also find that the herding effect is more prominent during down movements of the market. Conclusion: Herding behavior may lead to contemporaneous loss of investor confidence and capital withdrawal and thereby deprive the healthcare sector of the much needed capital for expansion. Thus there may be obvious delay in efforts to bridge the gap in access to healthcare facilities, medical support services, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and advanced medical equipment across China. Moreover, a potential crash in the healthcare market is possible in the healthcare sector as a result of persistent herding tendencies among investors and that may have more damaging consequences for health inequality in China.",

Leading the Asian healthcare renaissance is China due to uninterrupted economic emancipation and intensified government' effort to construct the social safety nets needed to reduce excessive inequality in access to healthcare in China and beyond [2] . The prevalence of health inequality in China is highlighted in several studies particularly in the recent publications of the World Health Organization, Institute for Health Economics of the Ministry of Health in China and international and regional humanitarian agencies including Medicine without Borders, the Red Cross Society etc [3] . All of these studies present a gloomy report of a national healthcare sector that is skewed in favour of the rich eastern provinces (Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong etc) relative to the poorer western provinces (Tibet, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Qinghai etc) [3] .",

Predictably, China achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history. This success was attained owing to strong public support for government intervention in health care, renewed political commitment from top leaders, heavy government subsidies, fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, healthcare financing and policy responsibilities delegated to local governments and pragmatic implementation strategy for health equality [5] .",

The 2015, China National Health Equality Survey (as reported by [6] ) shows that the provincial disparity in infant and childhood mortality (1:5), life expectancy (3:1), maternal mortality (1:4), doctor to patient ratio (6:1), health insurance coverage (3:1) and other indicators of health inequity favoured the eastern provinces. The disparities extend beyond the provincial level to include health inequity among migrant and resident population and genders. Typical of most equality induced healthcare reforms, China's approach to bridging the gap has largely focused on curbing disparities in health insurance coverage [7, 8] , legal barriers [9] , structural barriers [10] , disproportionate health care financing system [11] , linguistic barriers [12] , health illiteracy [13] , financial constrains [14] , demographic factors [15] and lack of healthcare facilities and personnel [16] .",

In China, the healthcare market has steadily attracted a lot of attention from investors (within and outside China) eyeing countercyclical stories and demographic trends that are less affected by the vagaries of currency risk and monetary policy [22] . This is also in response to the growing opportunities in the sector as wealthier elites are willing to spend more for better healthcare [1] . Despite the initial sell-off in the early 2000s, China's healthcare stocks as measured by the MSCI China Health Care Index bounced back substantially in mid 2002 following greater foreign investment. This was also boosted by an increase in medical supply arising out of the outbreak of zoonotic infections such as the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which ravaged through China in 2003. Other factors which sustained the upsurge in healthcare stock prices over a considerable period of time include enhanced medical supply and profit from the outbreak of the pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in 2007 and the Haemagglutinin (1) and Neuraminidase (1) (H1N1) influenza in 2009 [23] . Thus the nearly 15 % healthcare stock return achieved between 2003 and 2012 by China was only equaled by the healthcare stocks in Japan while health-care stocks around other Asian countries remained lower or unchanged [24] [25] [26] .",

Further, the Templeton Asset Management report posited that with the Chinese increasing their surveillance and quality control a lot of these saleable products in the domestic healthcare sector will become saleable globally and this will expand the market. Even though currently Chinese health-care stocks are generally commanding premium values to their peers in other emerging markets, a series of market fluctuations occurring intermittently (and more visibly between 2014 and 2015) in the Chinese healthcare stock market suggest that the market is susceptible to investors procyclical or herding behaviours. According to [27] a factor that recently pressured pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks in China was an announcement by China's National Development and Reform Commission ordering price cuts for certain drugs after a government reimbursement scheme for some drugs suddenly jumped up price of healthcare products and subsequently healthcare stocks.",

However, [28] argues that as China's economic growth rate begins to tumble and the presence of strict regulations intensify, many investors both individual and institutions have become more concerned about capital preservation, and are responding by abandoning long term investments strategies in the healthcare sector. Some have also reduced the risk exposure and switched to safer asset classes with the intention of switching back as soon as the market condition improves. Bohl et. al. [29] also explain that the trend is escalating because investors are imitating each other largely due to the strong social network which has become an unrivaled heritage of the Chinese business culture.",

Understanding the 'herding effect' on the healthcare sector is an important issue because endemic herding tendencies can have destabilizing impacts on the healthcare sector such as price synchronicity of stocks and healthcare products and services [33, 34] and even market crash [35] . Given the magnitude of dependence on healthcare, the impacts will spread to investment, employment and equitable distribution of healthcare resources and services [21] with its attendant consequences on social stability indicators such as healthcare inequity.",

These were based on studies conducted on equities in the US, international equities, commodity futures traded on European exchanges, Exchange Traded Funds and Chinese stocks respectively.

These studies are inconsistent with the test of herd behavior in the domestic loan market by [45] that extended the LSV herding measure proposed by [46] within a Japanese market. On the whole, the empirical evidence of herd behavior in the extant literature provides a general indication of the fact that stock markets in general and China in particular are less informationally efficient relative to the efficient market hypothesis hence the need for a study that extends the applicability of the market efficiency hypothesis. This is because the existence of herd formation will be a clear indicator of violation of the assumptions for an efficient market in which prices fully and instantaneously reflect all available information.",

The closest application of herding behavior in the healthcare sector are all outside China and are equally intended to explore its usefulness as information gathering mechanism for decision making which is sometimes at variance with the evidence based decision making process. For example [49] explores herding behavior as a psychosocial factor in quarantine during epidemic and how it can help ensure successful control while, [50] has applied herding behavior to how hospitals can form strategic groups in order to remain stable. Using a game-theoretical reflections [51] empirically validates the view that herding behavior can be used to appeal to free-riders to adopt pro-social behaviours in vaccine advocacy. Similarly, herding behavior is tested by [52] as a strategic management concept that can be used for hospital leadership and management while [53] identifies the negative aspects of herding behavior as an information aggregation system in healthcare relative to evidence based medicine. He warns healthcare institutions not to rush to implement policies and programs by merely following what contemporaries are doing. While all of the above studies have taken place outside China, these ground breaking attempts to draw on a field once thought to be purely economics and finance to the administration of mainstream healthcare is inspirational hence our attempt to advance the frontiers of the application of herding behavior in the healthcare sector by focusing on healthcare stock market and its potential implication for the whole healthcare market in China.",

To the best of our knowledge, the most recent effort at studying herding behavior in a specific industry in China are by [56] and [57] who focused on herding behavior in the housing industry in China. In both cases they employ different set of methodologies (least squares method and quantile regression method) which are totally different from those employed in this study. We extend the frontiers of current knowledge from the general (market) to the specific (industry) by empanelling and testing an ensemble of more sophisticated analytical models from the extant literature (cross sectional standard deviations-CSSD and cross sectional absolute deviations-CSAD on Chinese healthcare stock market. The results are then compared with our augmented State Space Model (which we call State Space Model 2) which is an enhancement on the existing State Space Model (which we call State Space Model I) in order to examine their respective statistical powers and subsequent robustness of inference. Understanding which models (summarized in the next section) yield herding behavior may provide information about the ways in which investors herd, the subsector with the greatest susceptibility to herding and its impact on health equity in particular and healthcare policy as a whole.",

This measure also represents the individual security return dispersion around the market average. The fundamental idea in this model is based on the argument that herd behavior prevents security returns from deviating far from the overall market return. This is because of the assumption that individuals are likely to suppress their personal beliefs and invest solely on the basis of collective actions of the market. Using the rational asset pricing models however give a different prediction that suggest that dispersions increases with changes in the absolute value of market return. This is because it is assumed that each asset is different as far as sensitivity to the market return is concerned. Additionally this model also implies that herd behavior may likely occur when market movements become extreme because they will usually go with the market consensus during such periods. Thus the behavior of the dispersion measure in (1) during periods of market stress is examined by estimating the following linear regression model:",

Despite a concern that this may be arbitrary, this is supported in the current literature [54, 56, 59] where extreme market return is defined a return lying between one to five percent lower or upper tail of the return distribution. Moreover, the dummies in Eq. (2) seek to capture the return dispersion differences in periods of extreme market movements. Since the formation of herd behavior implies conforming to the market consensus, the presence of negative and statistically significant \u03b2 D (for down markets) and \u03b2 U (for up markets) coefficients gives an indication of herd behavior among the market participants.",

            "text": "The study used a dataset containing the average daily returns of 399 stocks from 14 subsectors of the healthcare industry by CLSA and trading on three stock markets namely Shenzhen, Hongkong and Shanghai between July 2004 and June 2014. Each of these stocks is further sub classified into one of 14 subcategories of the healthcare sector (healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, medical supplies & distribution, pharmaceuticals diversified, pharmaceuticals generic and specialty, biotechnology, managed health care, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and research, advanced medical equipment manufacture, healthcare transportation, therapeutic medicine, medical tourism and other medical support services) as shown in Table 1 . This helps to verify whether a group is more likely to herd if trade is sufficiently homogeneous, i.e. each member faces a similar decision problem, and each member can see the trades of other group members [59] . As the years 2004, 2009 and 2014 witnessed periods of rapid foreign investment in Chinese healthcare market (because of policy incentives), data for the periods and share of foreign investment in all subsectors is highlighted. This is because the presence of foreign investors is seen as a significant precursor to herd formation [63] . The portfolio returns based on an equally weighted portfolio of all companies in the respective subsectors were then calculated. The information in Table 2 shows the summary statistics for average returns daily log, return dispersion and the average number of companies used to calculate these statistics for each sub-sector. Since the number of shares in a sector does not remain constant over time, the table shows the average number of companies during the sampling period in the second column of the table. Panel A shows that the average daily returns for all subsectors are positive. Other medical support services (4.184) and medical tourism (4.106) subsectors have the highest average daily return volatility based on the standard deviation of average daily returns. Panel B of Table 2 shows the summary statistics for daily cross sectional standard deviations within each subsector. In line with the results of Panel A, we observe higher volatility cross section in medical tourism. Table 3 is the results of estimates for the CSSD base model in equation 2. Given the significant changes in dispersion and strong correlation, all estimates are made using the Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors. The MSCI China A Healthcare Index was used to represent the market and the upper and lower one and five percentile of the market return was used to represent periods of market stress. The regression output shows a negatively significant parameter estimate (\u03b2 D ) for medical tourism subsector at 99 % confidence interval. On the contrary the parameter estimates for medical equipment manufacture subsector, and specialty, managed healthcare and other medical support service is significantly positive (99 % confidence interval). The parameter estimates for pharmaceuticals generic and therapeutic medicine is significantly positive at 90 % confidence interval and the remaining sectors are positive but insignificant. Thus generally (except medical tourism) cross-section standard deviation tends to be higher during periods of extremely down markets. This suggests that the included stocks do not move in the same direction as the market during periods of market stress but rather deviate more from general market movements when the market takes an extreme fall. Consistent with the work of [62] , this observation does not support herding.",

Similar to [38] , three distinct regressions were run for each subsector: one that uses the entire sample, and two limiting the data to up (or down) movement of the market index. Running separate models in this way allows us to examine if there is any asymmetric effect of herd behavior. The results from the non-linear model give completely different results than the first method. Table 4 again shows that the first nonlinear term (\u03b32) is statistically significant in almost all subsectors. It is very instructive to note that unlike the linear model, the R 2 values of the nonlinear regression models are generally higher than those of the linear model. This indicates that the non linear regression fits better than the linear regression in Table 3 as the proportion of the variance in herding that is predictable from the independent variable is higher. Generally, the information indicates that the inference made from the linear model disclosed in Table 3 may be spurious. Thus we rely heavily on evidence from the nonlinear test in Table 4 to make inferences about herding. In that regard, evidence of herd formation is found in all the subsectors and regressions yield statistically significant and negative estimates \u03b3 2 which indicates a declining nonlinear relationship between the market return and equity return dispersions. The results of regression analysis performed with respect to up and down markets separately show herding effect is mostly prominent in market losses. The results suggest that herd formation is most likely observed during periods of market losses.",

The results show strong evidence of herding through H mt and this is consistent with the findings using the non-linear model. It is observed that H mt is highly persistent with large and significant values of\u03c6m . Moreover \u03c3 m\u03b7 estimates are highly significant and indicate herd behavior. On the other hand, Table 6 show results of the augmented State Space Model 2 which contains two market variables (market return and market volatility). If these two are added in the measurement equation, it allows us to analyze the degree of herding, given the state of the market. In that regard, the findings are similar to that of the State Space Model 1 shown in Table 5 . Further, if the level of market volatility and market return are accounted for, the term H mt remains significant when the two explanatory variables are included. The findings indicate that herding behavior could explain changes in the volatility of factor sensitivities or dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (\u03b2 imt b ), instead of changes in fundamentals. Moreover positive and significant coefficients for the term log \u03c3 mt were estimated for most of the stocks in subsectors in the healthcare industry and that indicates an increasing dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (\u03b2 imt b ) with market volatility. This result is equally consistent with the previous studies that suggest that herding is more likely to occur during periods of market stress, i.e. highly volatile periods. Similarly, Table 6 shows that subsectors such as healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, pharmaceuticals diversified, biotechnology, diagnostic substances and healthcare transportation sub sectors have dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Std c (\u03b2 imt b ) that increases as market volatility rises since the coefficients for the market volatility term (log \u03c3 mt ) have significant and positive values. It is worth noting from Table 1 that that these subsectors (healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, pharmaceuticals diversified, biotechnology, diagnostic substances) are among those that have seen increase in foreign shareholding presence between 2004 and 2014. This gives credence to the view of [63, 64] that foreign investors may exhibit herding (***, ** and * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 % respectively) behavior more visibly than domestic individual investors.",

In addition, we simultaneously employ different models of herding at a large set of data to compare and contrast results to contextually test how these different approaches yield different or similar results of herd formation among investors. We found most of the models yielding evidence of endemic herding behavior in most of the healthcare subsectors in China. As indicated in the introductory section, there is enormous literature that supports the destabilizing effect of herd behavior in a sector including the healthcare sector. For example the effect of 'herding' on stock price synchronicity as suggested by [33, 34, 63] threatens distributive justice in healthcare resources in the sense that herding tendencies can stimulate sharp fluctuation in the prices of healthcare stocks en masse. This may lead to contemporaneous loss of investor confidence and capital withdrawal (see Akerlof and Shiller's [4] . This in no small way threatens equitable access to quick and affordable pharmaceutical and other healthcare products by the companies as the over 300,000 clinics, pharmacies and hospitals across the Western provinces that get supply from these facilities must resort to supply from other provinces [4] .",

Consistent with evidence adduced by [14, 35] health sector market crash creates limited supply of healthcare products, black marketeering of strategic healthcare products and unemployment. In China where the healthcare sector employs approximately 12 % of the low income population, the resulting loss of jobs from a health market crash may lead to high cost of healthcare products and services which can fuel income barriers to health equity. Thus, our findings may explain one of the reason why behavioral economist Richard Thaler thinks that the unsophistication and extrapolation biases in decision among Chinese healthcare investors and companies as well as unguarded response by the government makes a healthcare market crash in China potentially unprecedented in scale [16] . Similarly, the contribution of the Chinese healthcare sector to the global healthcare industry means that any aberrations can have a negative spillover effect and compound the already precarious health inequality in Asia, Africa and countries that substantially depends on China for healthcare services and products.",

If herding induced market crash leads to a reduction in inflow of medical services, products and equipments to these countries, there is a greater tendency to perpetuate inequity in healthcare in these countries [65] . This stems from the fact that consequential scarcity of healthcare resources will lead to disproportionate allocation of few resources to China dependent countries. Coupled with the expected increase in the cost of the available healthcare resources such as drugs and other supplies (due to scarcity), the resulting high cost of healthcare may likely be monumental as most of these ASEAN and African countries continue to reel under heavy economic challenges at both national and individual level. The effect on global and regional health inequity is thus unlikely to be insignificant. Consistent with previous studies, these findings elicit serious policy response to ameliorate any potential harmful effect of herding behavior on health equity in both China and other China dependent countries. Similar to the heavy involvement of Chinese government in the business sector, our analysis support the views of [9] of the necessity for the state to provide a greater proportion of public funding for health so that health care provision is not at the peril of private, for profit interests. This will reduce the impact of potential withdrawals of strategic healthcare companies such as Jiangsu Hengrui Med Co, Kangmei Pharmaceutical, Yunnan Baiyao Group Co, Dong E E Jiao Co, Tasly Pharmaceutical, Shanghai Raas Blood, Searainbow Hld Corp, Tonghua Dongbao Pharma, Shanghai Fosun Pharma, Beijing Tongrentang from western provinces deemed unprofitable albeit their healthcare needs.",

In reviewing the literature, we found out that recent pressure on pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks in China following the announcement by the China National Development and Reform Commission ordering price cuts for certain drugs after a government reimbursement scheme for some drugs was note well implemented. This is what led to a sudden hike in the price of healthcare products and subsequently healthcare stocks.",

We noted the prevalence of herding behavior in almost all the healthcare sector in China using different testing models. This is the first study to compare the effects of different empirical models of herding in the healthcare sector in China in its developing state. More importantly the existence of herding behavior in the health stock market provides significant implication for the healthcare sector and healthcare delivery in China and beyond especially for most countries that depend on China for several medical services and equipments. We have adequately discussed implications of the research for health equity in China and beyond and made policy recommendations. The results inspire curiosity on other remote factors that can trigger disequilibrium in the allocation of healthcare resources in other emerging markets.",
