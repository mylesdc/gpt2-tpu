Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high-and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.",

Although SARS-CoV is closely related to bat CoV (BtCoV) HKU3, and MERS-CoV is closely related to Pipistrellus BtCoV HKU5 and Tylonycteris BtCoV HKU4, the serologic and antigenic relationship between these viruses is unclear. Generally, coronaviruses across subgroups demonstrate a low level of cross-reactivity for the S protein and limited preservation of cross-neutralizing epitopes [5, 6] . However, few studies have demonstrated cross-reactivity among these Betacoronavirus. It has been shown that mouse hyperimmune sera to SARS-CoV harbor low levels of neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV [5] . Further, sera samples from SARS patients demonstrated 60.7% (17/28) binding and 25% (7/28) neutralizing activities to MERS-CoV, suggesting cross-reactivity within subgroup viruses [7] .",

Molecular tests such as RT-PCR and sequencing are majorly used in diagnosing MERS-CoV infections [12] . The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits the use of serological tests for investigational or surveillance settings and not for diagnosis [13] . They established a two-phase serological test approach to detect anti-MERS antibodies based on ELISA (targeting S1 antigen) followed by whole-virus IgG and IgM IIFT and microneutralization test for confirmation. The microneutralization assay is highly specific and it is the gold standard for measuring specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in sera samples. Nonetheless, compared with the ELISA and IIFT, the microneutralization assay requires a BSL3 facility, which is not available at many places, and it is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring at least 5 days before results are available [13, 14] .",

We also tested the cross-reactivity of IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples with the four circulating human coronaviruses using ELISA and IIFT. This study targeted three groups: (i) low-risk group constituted of 4719 samples obtained from blood donors (BD) collected over a period of five years (2012-2016), (ii) high-risk group represented by 135 samples obtained from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals who were in close contact with confirmed cases during the acute phase (first week), and (iii) four samples from PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV patients (CP). The highrisk group is defined by the individuals that were in direct contact with the confirmed cases either at work, house, or hospital (medical staff), prior or after symptom development. Our findings suggest that MERS-CoV is not heavily circulated among the population of Qatar. Additionally, the presence of antibody responses to other human coronaviruses resulted in false-positive results in binding assays, which mandate the need for more evaluation studies of the currently available diagnostic serological assays.",

In the absence of a clear epidemiological view of MERS-CoV, we present here a comparative serological study for the prevalence of anti-MERS coronavirus antibodies in high-and low-risk groups in Qatar. Following the WHO recommendation, we run initial screening for IgG antibodies using rS1-ELISA, and reactive samples were then confirmed with full virus and rS1-IIFT IgG, followed by ppNT. Combined results from different serological tests indicate the low presence of neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in the general population in Qatar (1/4719), while the rate increases to 1 : 135 in the high-risk group (CC). Our results revealed a few interesting observations. First, the only confirmed positive sample from the BD group was accidentally detected when we tested 13 randomly selected negative samples (originally selected to serve as a negative control) from the initial screening (using rS1-ELISA-IgG) for IgM response, where screening for IgM is not typically done in similar studies [14] . This mandates the development and utilization of assays that measure both classes of the antibodies for screening processes. Nonetheless, our results coincide with the low number of reported cases in Qatar (n = 21) compared to the neighboring countries such Saudi Arabia that has the highest number of reported MERS cases worldwide (n > 1700) [25, 26] . In a similar study using a similar approach in Saudi Arabia, 15/10009 (0.15%) were confirmed positive for anti-MERS antibodies in the general population.

Similar to the above observation in the general population, the rate of seropositivity in the high-risk group (CC) in our analysis was lower (1/135; 0.74%) than that observed in Saudi Arabia (7/227; 3.08%). Several factors could explain the difference between both studies including the difference in sample size as well as the demographics and livestock population in both countries.",

A recent study from South Korea indicated that humoral response to MERS-CoV, as measured by binding and neutralizing assays, wean rapidly after one year of infection and becomes undetectable in about 67% of those who show mild illness upon infection [27] . In another study from Korea, it was shown that none of the asymptomatically infected individuals showed seroconversion; however, the seroconversion rates gradually increased with increasing disease severity reaching 60.0%, 93.8%, and 100% in symptomatic infection without pneumonia, pneumonia without respiratory failure, and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure, respectively [28] . Such studies indicate that human humoral immune response to MERS-CoV is a complicated phenomenon that requires further investigation. It further implies that the infection rate with MERS-CoV in the Middle East could be underestimated and that the fatality rate associated with MERS-CoV infection is most likely overestimated.",

While 10/4719 (0.2%) samples were positive in this assay, only 2/10 (20%) were positive with whole-virus IgG-IIFT and null were confirmed with rS1-IIFT and ppNT (0%). Similarly, out of 10009 tested samples in the Saudi Arabia study, 152 were positive with rS1-ELISA (1.5%), 17 of which (11%) were positive with whole-virus IIFT and 15 were confirmed with neutralization assay [14] . These results indicate cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other human coronaviruses. To test this further, we employed several binding assays to test the reactivity of our samples with five known human coronaviruses, namely, SARS, HKU1, 229E, OC43, and NL63 CoV. Interestingly, all MERS-reactive samples from first screening, as well as most of the randomly selected negative control samples, had cross-reactivity to at least 3/4 seasonal human viruses, but none of them were cross-reactive with SARS-CoV. On the other hand, two of the CP samples were cross-reactive with SARS-CoV with intermediate titers. Accordingly, it is not clear which of the human coronavirus is inducing this cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV, which mandates further investigation. We also observed discrepancies in crossreactivity when using different assays, where rS1-based IIFT were more sensitive than full virus counterparts. That could be due to the higher concentration of the specific S1 protein in the first assay, which also ensures the use of defined regents (purified proteins) for developing screening assays.",

Using affinity purified and structurally defined protein might be more reliable to produce accurate results. The recent determination of several ectodomain structures from many coronaviruses should be instrumental to design better immunogens [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , which can also be utilized to develop more specific screening assays.
