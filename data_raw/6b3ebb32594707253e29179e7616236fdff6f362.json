The interdependency of public health and clean environment was identified as early as Hippocrates (460 BCE-367 BCE) in Airs, Waters and Places, which argued that geographical conditions and climate influence health [2, 3] . Many of us are convinced that the Zoobiquity approach is innovative, but as early as 350 BC, Aristoteles (384 BCE-322 BCE) in Historia Animalium presents the first documented approach to comparative medicine [4] . He diversified humans from animals through their possession of a rational soul. However, his intuition led him to relate animals to humans by documenting differences and similarities in the form, function and purpose of their parts. On this basis, he created a taxonomic system. Even Galen of Pergamum (129 CE-2216/217 CE), following Aristotele, wrote extensively about his numerous observations and experiments of animals [5] .",

His investigations proved the key role of the environment in human and animal health and diseases. D'Azyr correlated human and animal diseases with climatic and geographical conditions. He did not perceive any dividing line between human and animal medicine [10] . The founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon, France, by Claude Bourgelat (1712-1779) established formal education in animal health and its interaction with human health in Europe. The subsequent work of Louis-Ren\u00e9 Villerm\u00e9 (1782-1863) and Alexandre Parent-Duchatelet (1790-1835), also in France, led to the development of the veterinary specialty field of public hygiene [11] . It was a little later that the German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1827 Virchow ( -1902 coined the term 'zoonosis'. He insisted that health in humans and animals differed only in detail and not in kind. He recognized that environmental factors were key determinants of health outcomes. For example, his indications for ending a persistent epidemic of typhus, which he himself had investigated, was to provide the affected region with freedom, improved roads and good schools [12] .",

An ever-expanding number of scientific discoveries, \"milestones of understanding\" were developed in animal models and then applied to humans.

The contribution and inter-dependency of ecosystem health to the health of humans and animals received full recognition in early 2000, when One Health became the dominating approach to emerging threats related to avian and pandemic influenza. This likely triggered the popularity of the One-health concept beyond the limited scientific community, to the point that it was a well-represented issue in the agenda of the International Ministerial Conference on Avian and pandemic influenza in 2008 in Sharm El Sheikh. Since then, successful projects and growing attention have been focusing on the emergence of potentially zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and the ecosystem. Over the past couple of decades, outbreaks of avian influenza, West Nile, Ebola, MERS CoV and many others have urged funding agencies and international organizations to include wildlife in their studies, and even beyond that, some internationally funded projects are targeted to carry out surveillance focused on wildlife [18] .",
