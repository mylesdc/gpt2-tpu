However, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome in the development of acute wheeze is unclear. To investigate whether severe wheezing episodes in children are associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 109 children with acute wheezing attending the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Australia. The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to significantly relate to the bacterial community. Bacterial airway microbiome is highly variable in early life and its role in wheeze remains less clear than viral influences.",

No significant difference in alpha diversity was observed between the 2 groups (Richness, P = 0.363; Shannon-Weiner, P = 0.98; Inverse Simpsons, P = 0.654). Adonis permutational ANOVA revealed a significant difference in Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R 2 = 0.016, P = 0.003), Fig 2A. However, the variation explained was only 1%, suggesting a relationship driven by a small number of samples (see S1 Fig) . A random forest model was used to predict wheeze based on OTUs in the bacterial community. The predictive power of the model for cases and controls was found to be poor (out of box (OOB) error rate = 34.24%, p = 0.37), therefore the model results were considered unreliable and was not used in further investigation. However, indicator species analysis revealed a significant association of a single Veillonella OTU with the acute group. DeSeq2 analysis indicated the same Veillonella OTU associated with cases while several Haemophilus OTUs were found to be associated with controls (S2 Fig) Clinical variables were investigated to see if they were able to better explain bacterial community variation within this population. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to investigate 33 binary variables across all samples (S2 Table) . After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was found to show a significant difference in bacterial richness (p = 0.006), Shannon-Weiner (p = 0.017) and inverse Simpsons (p = 0.062). Significant differences in Shannon-Weiner and inverse Simpsons were observed in those that required oxygen and those that had ever attended kindergarten. It was noted, however, that none of the controls were positive for bronchiolitis or required oxygen. Therefore, this relationship was further tested in the acute wheeze population. Kruskal-Wallis with Dunns test was used to investigate categorical variables, however no significant results were observed. We did not find any differences in the microbiota that were attributable to recorded breastfeeding. No data was available to explore the effect of delivery method in this study. Pearson's correlations were used to investigate relationships between 20 continuous variables and alpha diversity measures (S3 Table) . Only bacterial biomass was found to have a weak significant correlation with bacterial richness. Significant changes in blood counts were not found to hold up to multiple testing and expected differences in the antimicrobial peptide cathlecidin were not found.",

However, we have observed that many samples are diverse and without a singular dominant organism. For example, Man et al, comparing those with lower respiratory tract infection and healthy controls, found no difference in alpha diversity, and using beta diversity measures found, similar to us, very small but significant differences between the groups (r 2 = 0.0031, p = <0.0001) [28] .

OP samples were specifically chosen as they showed greater representation to lower airway samples at least in stable patients [36, 37] . Whether acute OP swabs reflect lower airway samples in acute wheeze or acute viral episodes is still unclear but, interestingly, Man et al did show that intensive care patients had reasonable similarity between NP samples and lower respiratory tracheal samples (Bray Curtis similarity p = 0.61), but did find key differences, specifically that staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Dolosigranulum sp. were almost exclusively present in NP samples and absent from endotracheal aspirates [28] .",
