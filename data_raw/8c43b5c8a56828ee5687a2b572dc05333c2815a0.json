Combined anti-retroviral therapy (c-ART) has had a profound impact on the disease prognosis and transformed this infection into a chronic disease. However, HIV is able to persist within the infected host and the pandemic is still growing. The main 2014 ISHEID theme was, hence \"Together for a world without HIV and AIDS\". In this report we not only give details on this main topic but also summarize what has been discussed in the areas of HCV coinfection and present a short summary on currently emerging viral diseases.",

Stefano Vella reminded us of the hopes in the early days of the epidemic of a prophylactic vaccine within the next 3 years. This prediction probably refers on Margaret Heckler declaration in 1984 [1] but what she said is that as we were able to grow HIV, this would help finding a vaccine one day. Vella also listed the short-life of the experiment in treatment interruptions and, to the contrary, the prolonged use of D4T, and the delay in using surrogate markers and understanding the ART-associated side-effects such as lipodystrophy. We also took time to take into account the impact of ART as a preventative measure while the exact timing of ART initiation is still being assessed with in ongoing studies. Stefano Vella concluded that the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and the development of new drugs paved the way for the dramatic progress of the 1990s in terms of morbidity and mortality with combination therapy. Nearly 10 million of individuals are now on treatment worldwide and the appalling discrepancy in access between rich and developing countries is progressively being filled. This process is also exemplified by the 2013 WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Adults which have aligned themselves with those from other international committees.",

Professor Wainberg hypothesized that dolutegravir is a qualitatively superior drug than any of its predecessors and that drug resistance against dolutegravir may be impossible if this compound is used in first line therapy for reasons of efficient drug binding to the integrase enzyme and greatly reduced viral fitness if viruses do become minimally resistant. He stated that patients on dolutegravir may be unable to transmit HIV and that the use of this drug may therefore contribute to ending the HIV epidemic.",

Doravirine, a potent new NNRTI which is metabolized by CYP3A4 and active in vitro against viral strains with K103N, Y181C, G190A, E101K, E138K or K103N/Y181C is in development. The attachment inhibitor class has an interesting one daily compound active on both CCR5 and CCR2, cenicriviroc, which has also potential anti-inflammatory properties. BMS-663068 is an attachment inhibitor with a new mechanism of action. It binds to the envelope protein gp120 and is therefore different form the CCR5 class of drugs.

Chronic inflammation as discussed by Frank Miedema [8] is one of the critical factors in HIV pathogenesis and the most likely cause of non-AIDS end-organ disease encountered during chronic HIV infection such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and neuropathology. This process remains active even during combination ART. In Aging with HIV Paddy Mallon [9] reviewed the various markers of immune dysfunction and changes associated with ageing and HIV infection. The ageing process and HIV infection are associated with similar changes beside immune dysfunction such as bone changes and cardiovascular disease. The rational conclusion regarding comorbidities in HIV-patients was to address them early and to have a long view regarding the choice of ART regimen taking into consideration all these factors according to Barry Peters [10] . The place of statins was reviewed by Kenneth Lichtenstein [11] . His conclusion was that in terms of risk of type 2 diabetes their benefit outweighed the risk.

Our preventative tools have grown in the past few years with the acknowledgment of the impact of ART as a tool for prevention. Myron Cohen discussed the different prevention strategies and interventions in the uninfected and infected individuals. Factors associated with amplified transmission include those associated with infectiousness such as blood and genital tract viral load, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), viral clade and acute infection and susceptibility for the acquisition of the virus such as STDs among others. Joep Lange [15] reiterated the strong arguments in favor of early therapy and its individual and public health benefits in the implementation of TasP.

The hopes and challenges in HIV vaccine research were discussed at the 2014 ISHEID Conference. Vaccine challenges include the genetic diversity and mutability of HIV-1 that create a plethora of constantly changing antigens, the structural features of the viral envelope glycoprotein that disguise conserved receptorbinding sites from the immune system, and the presence of carbohydrate moieties that shield potential epitopes from antibodies. Indeed, HIV-1 gp120 contains a number of features that help the virus evade the host's humoral immunity, including variable loops, N-linked glycosylation, and conformational flexibility that disguise the conserved receptor-binding sites from the humoral immune system [2] . The presence of carbohydrate moieties on gp120 shields potential epitopes from binding to antibodies, as shown by Czernekova et al. [21] . By partially removing N-glycans from gp120 they increased the reactivity of a panel of gp120-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies and sera from HIV-1-infected persons.",

He also pointed out that there is a very limited rate of success in the development of vaccines to all forms of sexually transmitted disease, with the obvious exception being Human Papilloma Virus [2] . As reviewed by Marc Girard [22] , the first efficacy trials for an HIV vaccine attempting to elicit protective antibodies against the viral envelope, VAX004 and VAX003, did not prevent HIV-1 infection or impact the level of viraemia in those infected. The next set of antigens used in clinical efficacy studies were designed to test whether T cells could protect against HIV-1 infection. Neither the STEP trial (Ad5 gag/pol/nef ) nor HVTN 505 trial (DNA/rAd5 gag/ pol/nef/env prime/boost regimen) could protect against HIV-1 infection, or reduce early plasma HIV-1 levels. The proof of concept that it is possible for a vaccine to elicit protective immunity that blocks infection came from the RV144 clinical trial in Thailand that yielded a 31% reduction in HIV-1 acquisition using a canarypox-gp120 prime-boost vaccination regimen [23] . Moreover, as highlighted by Marc Girard, new surrogate markers of protection came from the RV144 trial, including the presence of V1-V2 targeted IgG. The V2 loop contains the binding site to the \u03b14\u03b27 receptor of CD4+ T cells involved in T cell migration to the GALT, and it is also part of several neutralization epitopes, including those recognized by broad neutralizing antibody (bNAb) VRC26.08 at the apex of the HIV-1 spike [24] . The RV144 trial also showed strong correlation between protection and IgG that target the C1 domain of gp120 and promote ADCC [25] . Several studies that addressed the question of correlates of protection from infection or from the disease were reported at the ISHEID Conference. The resistance to HIV-1 infection among exposed seronegative partners in HIV-discordant couples was associated with higher frequency of CD8 + T cells expressing CD107a/b and IFNascompared to unexposed subject [26] , suggesting a protective role of HIV-specific CTLs. The protective role of CTLs was also suggested by the finding that HIV controllers exhibit high frequency of CD8 + T-cells displaying the phenotype CD38 neg HLA-DR + and exerting ex-vivo cytotoxic activity, the frequency of these cells being correlated with the capacity of CD8 + T cells to inhibit viral replication [27] . A novel experimental approach was presented to analyze lymphocytes from post treatment controllers (PTC), in particular the presence of replication competent HIV, following transplantation of Rag2 -/c -/-(Rag-hu) mice with CD4 + T cells from the PTC and subsequent engraftment with human T cells [28] .",

They show potent cross-clade neutralizing activity against 70-90% of HIV-1 strains. They are remarkably protective against i.v. or mucosal HIV or SHIV infections in animal models, and they can suppress active infections in mice and macaques. bNAbs develop over a period of a few years (2.5 years average) in only 15-20% of HIV-1 infected persons, and they are the result of a long affinity maturation of B cells and extensive mutation of the B cell lineage that seem to be driven by long antigenic exposure [30] . A vaccine should offer protection against the majority of HIV strains. Hence, a number of questions should be addressed: i) are we able to design a vaccine that induces rapid production of V1V2-specific protective Abs? ii) how to transfer the knowledge of cross-specific antigens into immunogens that will induce powerful protective response following vaccination? iii) do we know enough about B cell maturation and plasmocyte differentiation? iv) which immunogen to develop considering that broadly neutralizing Abs that were identified are hypermutated ? it may be needed to stimulate a succession of antibodies that recognize epitopes and neutralize them in a series of vaccination; v) how to induce the correct B cells and stimulate them to produce Abs with a high degree of affinity maturation ? vi) how to induce humoral memory that is mediated by long-lived antibody-secreting cells? vii) successful vaccines (smallpox, hepatitis A, YF) elicit broad integrated responses involving all effectors, including innate (TLRs), NK, Th1/Th2 responses. Considering that innate immunity influences both the qualitative and quantitative features of adaptive immunity, we should identify the innate correlates of protection.",

In preclinical studies, GenePro, a lentiviral therapeutic vaccine that includes 7 out of 9 HIV genes, was able to induce in a single high dose a long-lasting and polyfunctional T-cell response in the nonhuman primate model [32] . Another lentiviral-based therapeutic vaccine was presented, generating a strong, specific and long-lasting T-cell response in mice, and currently evaluated in HAART-treated patients in a phase I/II vaccine trial [33] . A different approach consisted in the induction of neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 matrix protein p17 that, through the interaction of its NH2-residing epitope AT20 with specific receptors, acts extracellularly as a viral toxin. A peptide-based immunogen, AT20-KLH, was used in a phase I trial and shown to generate p17-specific antibodies able to neutralize its binding to cell receptors in HAARTtreated patients, and still detected two years after the first injection [34] .",

However the route of transmission is not fully understood (no evident association with pigs in most of the cases). Blood transfusion must be considered accordingly to the high number of asymptomatic viraemic donors. It is now evident that HEV may cause persistent disease in immune-compromised solid organ transplant recipients, individuals with HIV and patients with haematological malignancy. Patients with chronic HEV infection have no symptoms, but some develop rapidly progressive liver cirrhosis. HEV has important extra-hepatic manifestations, which deserve further investigation. For example, Dalton et al have shown that HEV is neuropathogenic, and can cause a wide range of neurological illness.",

Transmission to humans occurred in wet markets, mostly in large cities like Shanghai, in adults and elderly people, with a provisional fatality rate as high as 30% (122/413).

Marcel M\u00fcller [48] reports that all MERS cases were linked to the Arabian Peninsula and a few cases were imported into the European Union and Africa. Bats harbor a high diversity of related viruses and are suspected to be the animal reservoir. Recent studies have revealed that dromedary camels are the most likely intermediate host. MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedary camels for decades raising the question whether earlier human cases may have remained undetected. Preliminary serological surveys in Saudi Arabia could not determine increased seroprevalence for MERS-CoV antibodies in the population. Invitro studies showed that MERS-CoV inhibited important cellular pathways in particular the INF response. Confirmatory in-vivo experiments are still limited due to the lack of a suitable animal model, even non-human primates. A combination of pegylated IFN-alpha and RBV improved the clinical symptoms confirming previous in-vitro experiments. The development of vaccines is ongoing and vaccination programs in dromedary camels might be the optimal choice to control the current outbreak and prevent future re-introductions into the human population.",

The latter presented higher frequency of rheumatic disorders and significantly lower quality of life (QoL) than non-infected (CHIK-) responders, 30 months after the outbreak. Six years later, the 646 participants to the 2006 enquiry were sent selfquestionnaires by postmail with informed consent to the present study and proposal of new biological testing. Only 609 could be reached, and 252 fulfilled the questionnaire: 81 CHIK + (32%) and 171 CHIK-. The results are based on their declaration. CHIK + patients declared higher health care consumption between 2008 and 2012. They complained of more frequent and intense joint pain (40% versus 22% at least once a week, 64% versus 38% moderate to intense pain), stiffness and swelling, more frequent fatigue, headache and depress mood (respectively 60% versus 32%, 42% vs29% and 21vs 6%, p < 0.001). All dimensions of QoL were significantly impaired in CHIK + patients, reflecting social, physical and mental impact of the disease. The large differences observed in rheumatic morbidity, fatigue, and QoL lead to the conclusion that CHIK infection has very long term impact on health, social life and QoL with a very low proportion of patients returning to their previous health status.",

After the 2005-2006 CHIK outbreak in Reunion Island, CHIK-related RSMKD were retrospectively categorized and the empirical use of DMARDs starting with methotrexate (MTX) to treat the CIR forms was analyzed. The medical files of patients referred to rheumatologists in Saint Denis between 12/2005-05/2012 for persisting rheumatic disorders (>4 months) after a proven CHIK infection were reviewed [50] . De novo post-CHIK RMSKD was distinguished from exacerbation of pre-existing disorders. Among 159 patients included, 122 suffered from de novo RSMKD. RA accounted for 40/ 92, spondylarthropathy for 33/94, and distal undifferentiated polyarthritis for 21/94. Seventy-two patients were treated with MTX, reaching efficacy in 54 cases, versus failure in 18 cases. No severe side event was observed. The group \"efficacy\" was significantly associated with the early introduction of MTX within the first year of CIR progression (p =0.034).",
