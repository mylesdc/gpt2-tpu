Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes.",

The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFN\u03b3 gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy.",

The disease is usually self-limiting with \ufffd 0.5% mortality. However, an exceptionally high mortality (~20%) is recorded in pregnant women, especially in the later trimesters [9] . In India, fulminant hepatitis E in nonpregnant women and men has been recorded [10] . A recent report documented severity of hepatitis E in pregnant women from developed countries [11] . So far, chronic hepatitis E is restricted to immuno-compromised patients from the industrialized nations [12] [13] [14] .",

Understanding mechanism(s) of disease severity and mortality in pregnant women is of utmost importance and relevance for the endemic countries. However, pathogenesis of hepatitis E in general and during pregnancy in particular is not well understood. This is primarily because of the lack of small laboratory animal model and inability of nonhuman primate models to replicate fulminant disease during pregnancy [20, 21] . Recent reports of pregnant rabbit and BALB/c models may prove useful in understanding the basis for observed complications of HEV infection [22, 23] .",

Representative acute phase serum samples from these epidemics were subjected to HEV-specific PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis [39] . All the samples belonged to genotype-1. Two types of apparently healthy anti-HEV antibody negative control groups included (1) Non-pregnant subjects (n = 16) and (2) Pregnant women in the second and third trimesters. All the study subjects were screened for IgG and IgM-anti-HEV antibodies, IgM-anti-HAV antibodies, HBsAg, IgM-anti-HBc and anti-HCV antibodies (ELISA, Abbott, USA). A detailed clinical examination was done for all the acute viral hepatitis (AVH) cases. All AVH-E patients had typical symptoms of acute viral hepatitis, such as sudden onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, weakness and jaundice. A subclinical case was defined as an IgM anti-HEV positive with or without elevated ALT levels, no clinical symptoms at the time of first sampling and no development of symptoms up to 2 months follow-up.",

During both phases, the common GO terms were indicative of primary non-specific immune response: response to virus, immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response ( Fig 2B) . Mounting of robust innate as well as adaptive T cell and B cell immune response was unique to convalescence while over expression of blood coagulation was unique to the acute phase. Some KEGG pathways were significantly overrepresented during both phases of the disease, with upregulated genes after correction for multiple testing (FDR 5%), including: ribosome, systemic lupus erythematosus and oxidative phosphorylation with higher gene count in the convalescent phase ( Fig 2C) .The identification of systemic lupus erythematosus pathway is probably on account of the overlap with the complement pathways and the large number of histone genes that were upregulated.

We could identify several GO terms specific to subclinical infection when compared to NPR controls. However, several of these were related to pregnancy as evidenced by comparisons with pregnant controls. The relationship of immunoglobulin genes with disease presentation is noteworthy. The subclinical infection correlated with upregulation of lesser number of Ig genes (6 in the PR-2-SC and 5 in the PR-3-SC) than the corresponding acute disease (26 and 48 genes respectively). Further, humoral responses associated GO terms were enriched during subclinical infection during 2 nd trimester while no difference was seen among PR-3-SC and PR-3-acute patients. In fulminant hepatitis E, the number of antigen-specific, IgG-producing B cells increased following polyclonal stimulation of PBMCs than in the patients with uncomplicated clinical disease [49] .We, on the other hand, reported (i) higher anti-HEV titres in the fulminant hepatitis patients than the self-recovering non-pregnant patients [24] and (ii) lower IgG-anti-HEV titres in the pregnant women with subclinical HEV infection than those with clinical disease [40] . Taken together, antibodies seem to play an important role in disease severity. Role of antibodies in disease severity has been reported for several viral infections such as influenza [50] , SARS [51] , dengue [52] and measles [53] .",

Neutralization of the enveloped viruses depends on the disruption of viral lipid envelope, steric interference with receptor binding, interaction with cellular factors, or post-entry blocks [59] . In a mouse model deficient in activated \u03b1-defensins in the small intestine, Paneth cell \u03b1-defensins could protect mice from oral infection by a pathogenic mouse adenovirus 1 virus [60] . Antiviral activity through potentiation of neutralizing antibody response adds to the possible mechanisms of alpha defensins-dependent immunity. The role of both alpha defensins and S100 series molecules need to be confirmed by functional assays and extended to fulminant hepatitis E. Response to vitamin D was uniquely associated with subclinical infection during 2 nd trimester. Activated vitamin D is known to act as an immune system modulator preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines, increasing \"oxidative burst\" potential of macrophages and stimulation of the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides including defensins present in neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and certain epithelial cells.",

Disease presentation was associated with differential expression of S100 series, inversely proportion to overexpression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in the pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggested a role in protection. Based on the confirmation of the gene expression profiles obtained in this study by several functional studies reported earlier in acute as well as fulminant hepatitis patients with or without pregnancy, it may be summarized that clinical presentation in hepatitis E represent distinct transcriptional profiles with respect to immune response.
