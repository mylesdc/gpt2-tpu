            "text": "Dietary fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to synergistically contribute to ingestive behavior and thereby obesity. Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT 1 receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT 2 receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT 2 receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the reninangiotensin system, and the AT 2 receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.",

Excess fat intake is similarly associated with obesity 4 , and is used to drive animal models of diet-induced obesity 5 .

Briefly, obesity is positively correlated with circulating RAS activity in humans and animal models [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Genetic or pharmacological interference with the RAS in rodents results in weight loss, reduced adiposity, and/or altered adipose development [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . There is also growing evidence for opposing, tissue/site-specific roles for the RAS in the control of appetite/ingestive behavior 29, 30 and in the control of resting metabolism 9, [31] [32] [33] [34] . As the RAS is strongly suppressed by dietary sodium 35 , this led us to the secondary hypothesis that any observed metabolic consequences of altered dietary sodium may be mediated through its modulation of the RAS.",

This increase in weight gain was primarily due to a robust, early increase in adiposity and slower subsequent (possibly reflexive) increases in lean and fluid masses ( Figure S1A ). Animals maintained on HFD with lower sodium content exhibited specific expansions of traditional white adipose tissues, including subcutaneous inguinal and perigenital fat pads, while other tissues remained largely unchanged by diet (interscapular \"brown\" adipose, heart, liver and kidney) ( Figure S1B ).",

Importantly, RER was suppressed in both HFD groups, as would be expected with increased metabolic utilization of fatty acids. Spontaneous physical activity was indistinguishable across groups. A similar lack of effect of the dietary interventions was maintained through eight weeks of treatment (Fig. 2B) , save a slight increase in metabolic rate in the HFD + 0.25% NaCl group. This divergence is almost certainly due to the increased body mass of the animals after eight weeks on the diet.

Specifically, NaCl consumption varied from roughly 5 g/d in Alaskan Eskimos where hypertension was extremely rare, to 25 g/d in Northern Japanese, where nearly one third of the population exhibited hypertension. Estimating an adult human's daily food intake at 1.2 kg/d 37 , this would support a range of 0.4-2.1% NaCl in typical human foods. Similarly, the INTERSALT study documented a range of 23 mg/d sodium intake in the Yanomamo tribe of Brazil, to 6 g/d in China 38, 39 . Again using an average 1.2 kg/d food ingestion and assuming all of the sodium was consumed as NaCl, this would equate to a range of 0.005-1.275% NaCl in food. Similarly, O'Donnell recently reported on behalf of the PURE study (including 101,945 individual human subjects across 17 countries) that the average sodium intake is 4.93 g/d, which would equate to 12.53 g/d of NaCl; using similar food intake estimates as above, this yields a 1.04% NaCl diet equivalent 40 . According to nutritional information provided by the McDonald's USA corporation, a Quarter Pounder with Cheese and medium-sized French Fries meal includes the rough equivalent of 1.1% NaCl 41 . Thus, our examination of the effects of 0.25-4% NaCl in the context of a high fat diet is relevant and applicable to humans across a wide spectrum of cultures and populations.",

            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system, or its downstream mediators, may represent novel targets for the modulation of digestive efficiency. As recently reviewed by Garg et al. 44 , essentially all components of the RAS are expressed throughout the digestive system. Renin is readily present in the circulation and its mRNA has been detected in human small intestine 45 and colon 46 . ACE and ACE2 are strongly expressed in the small intestine (in fact, the highest human tissue concentrations of these enzymes are in intestine) [47] [48] [49] [50] and colon 46 , and neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin) shows similar patterns of expression 51 . AT 1 receptors are localized to the epithelial brush border, circular and longitudinal muscle layers and myenteric plexus of the small intestine, but AT 2 receptors are restricted to the myenteric plexus [52] [53] [54] . AT 1 and AT 2 are also expressed in various layers of the colon 46 , stomach 55 , and esophagus 56, 57 . Angiotensinogen is expressed throughout the small intestine 58 , colon 59 , and stomach 55 . Various RAS peptides including angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) have been documented in various portions of the GI tract 52, 60 . Thus, the RAS is present in the viscera and it is therefore positioned to potentially play an important role in the control of digestive function. Ang II action at AT 2 receptors has been documented to functionally influence digestive system function. Ang II stimulates apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells via the AT 2 receptor 61 . Activation of AT 2 by CGP-42112a causes increased nitric oxide production in jejunal mucosa 62 . Low-dose Ang II delivery stimulates jejunal water and electrolyte absorption, and this effect appears to be mediated through an AT 2 -cGMP signaling mechanism 63 . While AT 1 and AT 2 receptors are both present on pancreatic acinar cells and secretion of digestive enzymes by these cells is stimulated by Ang II, this effect is blocked by losartan but not PD-123,319, highlighting a role for AT 1 but not AT 2 64 . The RAS may therefore mediate its effects on caloric absorption through a complex modulation of digestive enzyme secretion and gastric motility, or other as-yet unidentified mechanisms.",

While various genetic and pharmacological manipulations to other components of the RAS have anti-obesity effects in rodents, we have been unable to find any mention of effects of these manipulations upon digestive efficiency. We hypothesize that this may simply be a consequence of many laboratories ignoring the physiological significance of digestive efficiency modulation, as food intake data are very rarely corrected for digestive efficiency in discussions of the relative effects of genetic, pharmacological, and dietary manipulations upon total energy balance.",

            "text": "Unlike Takahashi's studies of global renin knockout mice 20 , in the present study we did not observe changes in net thermogenesis/energy expenditure. This may reflect the universal disruption of renin in genetic knockout mice, versus a modulation of predominantly the circulating RAS with dietary sodium changes, as salt-sensitive models of hypertension exhibit suppressed circulating RAS activity but elevated brain RAS activity [65] [66] [67] . It appears, however, that dietary fats and sodium content may shift the form of energy utilization toward aerobic processes and away from non-aerobic processes. Respirometric estimates of heat production ignore the contributions of anaerobic and nitrogen metabolisms, and are subject to a long list of required assumptions regarding the test subject's physiology 68 . It has been demonstrated that respirometry grossly underestimates true total metabolic rate by up to 38% in various endothermic species 69 . We previously demonstrated that resting metabolic rate (RMR) of laboratory mice is underestimated by respirometric methods, and that this rate of underestimation is highly variable 31 . The variability of underestimation is so great that qualitatively false negative and false positive conclusions regarding the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulations in mice can result 31 . Very recently we demonstrated that respirometry indicates a false positive effect of switching from standard chow to a 45% HFD upon total RMR in wildtype C57BL/6J mice 70 . Specifically, we determined that with a shift from chow to HFD, respirometry detects a significant (~0.01 kcal/hr) increase in aerobic RMR but fails to capture the simultaneous and equally large decrease in non-aerobic RMR. That observation is now replicated in the present study, where animals switched to HFD exhibited an apparent increase in aerobic RMR but no change in total RMR. In other words, dietary shifts qualitatively change the contributions of various types of resting metabolic processes (i.e. -aerobic vs non-aerobic), but have no observed quantitative effect on total resting energy expenditure.",
