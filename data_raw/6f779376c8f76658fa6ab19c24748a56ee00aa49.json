            "text": "Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) -a member of the alphavirus-like supergroup of viruses -serves as a model system for positive-stranded RNA virus membrane-bound replication. TYMV encodes a precursor replication polyprotein that is processed by the endoproteolytic activity of its internal cysteine proteinase domain (PRO). We recently reported that PRO is actually a multifunctional enzyme with a specific ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity that contributes to viral infectivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 150-residue PRO. Strikingly, PRO displays no homology to other processing proteinases from positive-stranded RNA viruses, including that of alphaviruses. Instead, the closest structural homologs of PRO are DUBs from the Ovarian tumor (OTU) family. In the crystal, one molecule's C-terminus inserts into the catalytic cleft of the next, providing a view of the N-terminal product complex in replication polyprotein processing. This allows us to locate the specificity determinants of PRO for its proteinase substrates. In addition to the catalytic cleft, at the exit of which the active site is unusually pared down and solvent-exposed, a key element in molecular recognition by PRO is a lobe N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Docking models and the activities of PRO and PRO mutants in a deubiquitylating assay suggest that this N-terminal lobe is also likely involved in PRO's DUB function. Our data thus establish that DUBs can evolve to specifically hydrolyze both iso-and endopeptide bonds with different sequences. This is achieved by the use of multiple specificity determinants, as recognition of substrate patches distant from the cleavage sites allows a relaxed specificity of PRO at the sites themselves. Our results thus shed light on how such a compact protein achieves a diversity of key functions in viral genome replication and host-pathogen interaction.",

From the sequencing of their genomes, it has become clear that despite a huge diversity, these viruses possess high similarities at the molecular level [2] [3] . Indeed, common strategies and regulatory mechanisms have been uncovered in the replication of RNA+ viruses [4] . Thus, all RNA+ viruses studied to date synthesize new viral genomes at an intracellular membrane. There, synthesis of the viral progeny requires the establishment of specific and regulated interactions between viral proteins and different cellular factors, assembled within a replication complex. In RNA+ viruses, the replication proteins are usually synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that may be subsequently processed by viral (and sometimes also cellular) proteinases. Another common feature of RNA+ viruses is that the highly compact viral genome codes for usually multifunctional proteins.",

It is included in the alphavirus-like supergroup of RNA+ viruses [3] that also comprises the animal alphaviruses (including Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus and Chikungunya virus) and rubiviruses (including Rubella virus). Indeed, TYMV shares with these viruses striking similarities in the organization and processing of the replication polyprotein [8] . Its 6.3-kb genome codes for three proteins, the largest of which (206K) is a polyprotein of 206 kDa that contains all the viral components of the replication machinery ( Fig. S1 in Text S1). From N-to C-terminus, 206K harbors methyltransferase (MT), cysteine proteinase (PRO), helicase (HEL or 42K) and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (POL or 66K) domains. In previous works, we established that the PRO domain is a key regulator of TYMV replication. First, its endopeptidase activity is required to proteolytically process 206K at the HEL/POL junctions to release the 66K polymerase, while a second cleavage at the PRO/HEL junction contributes to the regulation of viral RNA synthesis [8] . The PRO domain is also essential for the recruitment of 66K to the membrane replication sites [7] . Finally, we recently reported that TYMV PRO also displays an ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity in vitro and in vivo, and identified 66K polymerase as a specific substrate of this activity [9] . PRO's DUB isopeptidase activity is thus also a key factor for the interaction of the virus with its host, in counteracting the ubiquitin-proteasome system and possibly subverting it into regulating availability of 66K for TYMV replication [10] .",

In order to replicate their genome, they first need to invade a host cell and, with usually very limited viral genetic material, subvert the host's molecular machinery. Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is an excellent model system for studying positive-stranded RNA virus replication. As for many such viruses, TYMV genome replication is dependent on the activity of a viral proteinase (PRO) to properly process the virus' replication molecules. We have recently established that PRO is a multifunctional enzyme and is also used by TYMV to subvert a key host defense against pathogens. We report here the atomic structure of PRO as well as new functional data on PRO's interaction with the host. Our data shed light on how PRO can perform such multiple activities despite its small size, providing TYMV with a Swiss army knife in its ongoing fight with a vastly more complex host.",

            "text": "A DALI superposition of yOTU1 and vOTU yields a Z-score of 12.2. This higher score is due to yOTU1 and vOTU being structurally superimposable on a significantly larger number of residues (126 residues matched by DALI). Of note, in both yOTU1 and vOTU, the segment directly upstream of the homolog of helix a3 (in green on Fig. 1C ) partially covers the exit from the active site. In contrast, the catalytic dyad of TYMV PRO Cys783-His869 is completely solvent exposed (Figs. 1C, 2A and 2C). There is no pocket that could act as a stabilizer for the oxyanion intermediate in the reaction for cysteine and serine proteases. Indeed, due to the lack of a covering segment there is no counterpart for the main chain nitrogen of Asp37 of vOTU (Fig. 2C) , that has been proposed to participate in formation of this oxyanion hole [15] . Furthermore, the side chain of Trp99 of vOTU, that has been shown to take part in oxyanion hole formation [16] , is missing in TYMV PRO's Gly821 (Fig. 2C) . Similarly, there is no candidate in PRO for a catalytic residue acting as a general acid to stabilize and activate the side chain of His869. Asp153 of vOTU, that has been shown to be implicated in the catalytic triad [16] , is replaced by a serine in Tymoviridae as Trp99 is replaced by a glycine (Fig. 2C, Fig. 1B) . Thus, TYMV PRO's catalytic site appears to be reduced to an exposed dyad, possibly explaining in part its poor DUB activity [9] (see below) compared to e.g. vOTU [15] [14] [16] . Furthermore, although the dyad itself is almost superimposable with the corresponding residues of yOTU1 and vOTU ( Fig. 2C and legend thereof), the Cys783 side chain is flipped and makes no interaction with the His869 side chain. Thus the PRO active site is most likely not in its catalytically competent state in the crystal, where we caught a product release state (see below).",

The b2-a3 loop threads through a cleft between helices a4 and a5 at the back of the central lobe. This results in the N-terminal lobe being apposed to the catalytic domain ( Fig. 1A ) but on the other side from the catalytic dyad ( Fig. 2A) . Important residues in this positioning of loop b2-a3 are Arg769, that participates in an extended network of interactions, including a salt bridge to Asp809 and a hydrogen bond to Pro808 at the base of a5; Pro777, that positions the main chain to make two hydrogen bonds to the indole ring nitrogen of Trp800 in a4; and Pro779, that inserts into a hydrophobic pocket lined by Trp800, Leu785 and Leu822. The pattern of conservation among Tymoviridae proteinases (Fig. 1B) indicates that this arrangement, and consequently the position of the N-terminal lobe, are very likely conserved in the family.",

The specificity of PRO is on the N-terminal (P) side of the scissile bond, while the C-terminal (P') side is not important as defined by mutagenesis studies [19] [8] .

Accordingly, we find that PRO solutions up to 10 mg/ml are monodisperse as measured by dynamic light scattering (not shown), with an hydrodynamic radius of 2.3 nm very close to the one calculated from the crystal structure for the PRO monomer (2.14 nm). The residues involved in the interface are mostly, but not exclusively (Fig. 3A) in and around the entry to the catalytic cleft for the peptidase and in the C-terminus for the substrate, respectively. The last five residues of the substrate 875-Arg s -Leu s -Leu s -Gly s -Ser s -879 are funneled in an extended beta conformation towards the catalytic dyad of the peptidase Cys p 783-His p 869 (Fig. 3B , where the peptidase residues are labeled in white and the substrate residues in black). Indeed one of the carboxyterminal oxygens and the main chain nitrogen of Ser s 879 are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain nitrogen and carbonyl, respectively, of Phe p 870. Likewise, the main chain polar atoms of Gly s 878 are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain polar atoms of Leu p 822 in the connection between helices a6 and a7 on the other side of the catalytic cleft. The net effect is a small three-stranded intermolecular beta-sheet firmly holding 878-Gly s -Ser s -879 in place. The other Ser s 879 carboxyterminal oxygen is hydrogenbonded to the side chain of His p 869. This is the only interaction stabilizing this side chain in the crystal (see above) and it is less well ordered than the other residues in the catalytic cleft ( Fig. S4 in Text S1). Further upstream the substrate, the extended conformation of the main chain is maintained by hydrogen bonds from side chains of the peptidase. Key side chains are those of His p 862 (that also participates in the P4 and P2 specificity, see below) and Thr p 824 (Fig. 3B ).",

            "text": "In our crystal structure, the side chain hydroxyl of Ser s 879 hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen of the catalytic Cys p 783 (Fig. 3B) . The relaxed G/A/S specificity at P1 stems largely from the solvent exposure of the exit of the catalytic cleft (see above). Still, the side chain of Leu p 781 caps the S1 site, precluding the presence of a large side chain at position P1. Similarly, the constriction of the active site cleft at the S2 pocket is less pronounced than in yOTU1 and vOTU, where bulky residues strictly restrict specificity to GG. The S2 pocket, lined by His p 862, Phe p 870 and Ser p 868 and occupied by Gly s 878 in our crystal structure, could readily accommodate a small side chain. At first sight, the sharp difference in specificity between P3 (seemingly no specificity) and P4 (strict specificity for a hydrophobic amino acid with a strong preference for Leu) [8] is somewhat surprising. Both Leu s 877 (P3) and Leu s 876 (P4) make extensive contacts to conserved, shallow hydrophobic pockets at the surface of the peptidase's central and C-terminal lobes, respectively. These contacts bury respectively 89% of Leu s 877's and 96% of Leu s 876's solvent-accessible surface area, as reported by PISA. Two major differences though are that Leu s 877 (P3) is buttressed only on one side and that the S3 pocket is lined by negatively charged residues (the outer edge of the acidic pocket depicted on Fig. 2B ). This explains why P3 may be mutated to Ala and may naturally be either a hydrophobic (e.g. Leu), small polar (e.g. Asn) or arginine side chain, but an aspartate is never found at this position [8] . In contrast, Leu s 876 (P4) is sandwiched between two strictly apolar surfaces on the two C-terminal lobes of the peptidase and substrate, respectively, with His p 862, Phe p 870, Val p 840, Ile p 847 and Ser p 842 on one side and Pro s 846 and Tyr s 841 on the other side. This likely accounts for the specificity at position P4. As for the strict P5 specificity for a positively charged amino acid, it is readily explained by the fact that P5 inserts its side chain into the acidic pocket depicted on Fig. 2B . Indeed, Arg s 875 makes salt bridges to two conserved glutamates that protrude from the central lobe of the peptidase, Glu p 816 in the small helix a6 overhanging the S3 pocket and Glu p 825 in helix a7.",

To account for this known flexibility of the C-terminal tail of Ub [21] , multiple conformations were sampled prior to the rigid-body docking step so as not to bias the interface too heavily towards a given binding mode. Two clusters of solutions were found, among which only the largest cluster (which also contains the complex with the best HADDOCK score) had a binding mode consistent with the C-terminal residues of Ub in the PRO active site. This binding mode was cross-confirmed by other docking simulations using alternative methodologies, in particular without applying prior restraints between the putative binding regions (see Protocol S2 in Text S1). Further inspection of the lowest energy structure (Fig. 4C) shows that the orientation of ubiquitin is similar to that in the vOTU complex and that the predicted interface prominently involves PRO's N-terminal lobe. Indeed, the tip of the lobe's extended a2-b2 loop inserts into the patch (Fig. 4D) , suggesting that Glu759 and Asn760, that participate in PRO s binding (Fig. 3A) , may also be involved in ubiquitin recognition.",

Since such interactions are usually good specificity but weak affinity determinants, we further looked for hydrophobic patches on PRO's surface that could come into contact with the Ile44 patch based on the model prediction. We found two such PRO patches on either side of the Ile44 patch (Fig. 4D ). One is made by Leu732/Leu765 in the N-terminal lobe. The other is centered on Ile847. Although not part of the N-terminal lobe, Ile847 seemed an excellent candidate as it is an exposed residue with a conserved hydrophobic character (Fig. 1B) . This matches a known feature of interface evolution, where contacts between apolar patches are the most conserved although the residues themselves may not be [22] . Thus if the docking model was correct and Ile847 was an interface residue with the Ile44 patch, we expected a reduction in the bulk of its side chain to reduce the interaction and the substitution for a short charged residue to almost abolish it.

Such an event is common enough in the viral world, particularly among positive-stranded RNA viruses, and may in principle be achieved either in cis (the proteinase domain cleaves the polypeptide of which it is a part) or in trans (it cleaves another polyprotein molecule). Our structure precludes the possibility of the C-terminus of PRO looping back towards the entry to the catalytic cleft in the same molecule. Therefore, cleavage of the TYMV replication polyprotein at the PRO/HEL junction occurs only in trans. This cleavage is a regulatory event in the replication of the TYMV RNA genome. It occurs in the replication complex comprising the two products of the first cleavage: the 66K RdRp and the 140K protein. 140K harbors PRO and localization determinants to the chloroplast envelope, where it recruits 66K. There, cleavage of 140K at the PRO/ HEL junction into 98K and the 42K helicase contributes to the switch to synthesis of the +strand [7] [8] (Fig. S1 in Text S1). A strictly trans cleavage likely takes part in the regulation by requiring a sufficient local concentration of 140K at the chloroplast membrane and/or remodeling of this membrane into a special compartment for viral replication before synthesis of new viral genomes.

The fact that PRO proteinase specificity is confined to the P side is readily explained by the fact that the catalytic cleft ends abruptly at the catalytic dyad, leaving it completely solvent-exposed. Thus, residues on the P' side of the substrates will have little or no contact with PRO. In contrast, there are extensive interactions with the P-side residues up to P5 from both lobes making up the catalytic proteinase domain. The C-terminal b-sheet lobe thus provides a hydrophobic pocket for P4 and the central a-helical lobe an acidic pocket contributing salt bridges to the positively charged P5 and a shallow hydrophobic patch for P3. The constriction of the active site cleft at the interface between the two lobes ensures that only small residues (but not necessarily glycines) can be at positions P2 and P1.",

Our crystal structure shows that the latter property is linked to an unusual solvent exposure of the active site of PRO on the P'/ lysine sidechain side of the cleavage. The former property of relaxed sequence specificity is allowed by an also unusual lesser constriction of the PRO active site cleft at the P1 and P2 positions (see below). Such features imply that PRO may be more heavily dependent on the recognition of additional molecular determinants away from the active site, in order to maintain sufficient substrate affinity and most importantly, high substrate specificity.",

First, an acidic pocket to the side of the entry to the active site strongly favors a positively charged residue in P5 of the substrate. Second and most important, we identify the Tymoviridae-specific N-terminal lobe of PRO as a recognition element for surface patches of the PRO/HEL substrate, as this lobe was found to recognize a signature bulge made of the two successive cis-prolines in the PRO substrate molecule. Whether the N-terminal lobe is also prominently used in recognition of the HEL/66K junction cannot be assessed at present. However, docking of the PRO/Ub complex and subsequent mutational analysis of the DUB activity of PRO suggest that PRO targets the Ile44 patch that is recognized by all characterized DUBs in part with elements also involved in recognition of PRO s , such as Ile847 and possibly the a2-b2 loop. Of note, our docking model places the three residues that differ between plant ubiquitin (the natural TYMV PRO target) and human ubiquitin (that we used in modeling and functional work) on the side of ubiquitin opposite the interfaces with PRO (Fig. S7 in Text S1). This would rule out a different behavior of the natural substrate of PRO's DUB function (plant ubiquitin) compared to the readily available experimental substrates (derivatives of human ubiquitin).",

            "text": "Using a myc-tagged version of human ubiquitin, it was previously shown that, in contrast to other viral DUBs (e.g. vOTU), 98K is a very specific DUB whose overexpression in cells does not lead to a global deubiquitylation of cellular proteins but rather to specific deubiquitylation of 66K [9] . Several lysine side chains of 66K are polyubiquitylated in vivo [10] and the types of these ubiquitin chain linkages are presently unknown. In vitro TYMV PRO may disassemble both Lys48-linked and Lys63linked polyubiquitin chains, albeit with weak activity [9] . In the light of our findings, one may ask whether PRO may display specificity to particular ubiquitin linkages. Specificity may be achieved in several ways, e.g. on the P'/Lys side of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 4E ) either by recognizing the sequence context of the modified lysine or by positioning the Lys-linked moiety. In either case, addressing the question of specificity would require modeling a diubiquitin chain across PRO's catalytic site. Such an exercise (not shown) must be highly speculative at the moment in the absence of structures for relevant complexes of OTU DUBs [23] . We may note that, as for other OTU DUBs, the isopeptide bonds in extended linkages (such as Lys63-linked polyubiquitin) can in principle be readily accessed by PRO, but compact chain conformations (as in Lys48-linked polyubiquitin) require an extensive conformational change to expose the isopeptide bond and allow binding and cleavage by PRO [23] . But the question of linkage specificity can also be addressed by modeling a diubiquitin chain on the P side of PRO's catalytic cleft (Fig. 4E) . Molecular recognition of Lys48-linked chains is poorly understood, as in their compact conformations their ubiquitin moieties interact through their Ile44 patches. It is proposed that structural flexibility allows transient access to the Ile44 patches to binding partners, and indeed a minor population of more open Lys48-linked diubiquitin has been modeled from nuclear magnetic resonance data [23] . Interestingly, placing this minor conformation onto our docking model results in PRO's N-terminal lobe being sandwiched between the catalytic domain and the Lys48-linked diubiquitin and making contact with both ot the latter's Ile44 patches (Fig. 4E,  top) . On the other hand, similarly placing the structure of a Lys63linked diubiquitin predicts no interactions to the second moiety (Fig. 4E, bottom) , due to the extended character of the Lys63 linkage.",

It might also explain in part why PRO displays rather poor activity for a DUB (e.g. compared to vOTU [14] [15] [16] ) in a general deubiquitylation assay using a monoubiquitin derivative [9] (this work), with a Km in the tens of micromolar range (Fig. 5A) . The other obvious feature of TYMV PRO explaining its lesser activity is the minimal character of its active site. It lacks altogether two important functional elements that are present in most cysteine proteinases, including the closest relatives of PRO (clan CA, including yOTU1 and vOTU, see below): The oxyanion hole and a general acid as the third catalytic residue.

The first is clan CA, that comprises yOTU1 and vOTU. Another is clan CN, whose type is the nsP2 proteinase of alphaviruses [24] . Alphaviruses, including Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest Virus and Chikungunya virus, are animal relatives of tymoviruses. The two virus families share many features in their replication strategies, including successive cleavages of the replication polyprotein by the resident proteinase regulating RNA+ vs 2strand synthesis [8] . Nevertheless, our data clearly show that PRO is unrelated to nsP2 and assign PRO to clan CA, a result that could not be firmly established by sequence comparisons alone (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) [25] [9] . The two other families of processing proteinases assigned to clan CA are also from positive-stranded RNA viruses: They are the coronavirus papain-like proteinases PLP1 and PLP2 [26] [27] and the picornavirus leader proteinase [28] . These proteinases have also been reported to be ubiquitin hydrolases [27] [29] . Yet PRO does not display detectable homology to these proteinases.",

In this closest family to Tymoviridae, some of the replication proteins encode two peptidase domains, an OTU domain being N-terminal to the processing proteinase P [30] . One may therefore picture a scenario in which an ancestor to Tymoviridae harbored such a two-peptidase replication polyprotein. Subsequently, the OTU peptidase acquired specificity determinants allowing its use as processing proteinase and the P domain was lost. This report and previous works [13] [14] [15] establish that nonhomologous recognition modules have repeatedly evolved in the OTU family of DUBs, which is consistent with such a scenario. Whatever actually happened, the present diversity of specific functions performed by PRO is remarkable in a proteinase domain that is no larger (148 ordered residues) than the more specialized vOTU (162 ordered residues) or yOTU1 (170 ordered residues). Our results shed light on the molecular details that allow such a compact protein to perform a diversity of key functions in viral genome replication and host-pathogen interaction.",

Samples were concentrated to 200-1096 mM, dialyzed in 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, aliquoted and kept at 280uC until use. DUB activity was assessed in Assay buffer (HEPES-KOH 50 mM pH 7.8, KCl 10 mM, EDTA 0.5 mM, DTT 5 mM, NP40 0.5%, DMSO 2%) using the fluorogenic substrate Ub-AMC (Boston Biochem). DMSO was adjusted to 2% in all assays to match the DMSO concentration in the highest Ub-AMC concentration tests. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by monitoring AMC-released fluorescence as described previously [9] with some modifications. Assays were performed at 20uC in a temperature-controlled Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. The initial velocity V was derived from the linear increase in fluorescence at 460 nm (excitation at 380 nm) in minutes 1 to 11 after mixing in Ub-AMC.",

The N-terminal lobe is colored in blue, the central lobe in green and the C-terminal lobe in red. Secondary structure elements are labeled: a for helices and b for b-sheets with numbers from N to C-terminal for each kind of element. B, Amino acid sequence alignment of polyprotein processing endopeptidases belonging to the Tymoviridae family. Proteinase domain sequences are displayed as capital letters for TYMV (Turnip yellow mosaic virus), ChMV (Chayote mosaic virus), PhyMV (Physalis mottle virus), EMV (Eggplant mosaic virus), DuMV (Dulcamara mottle virus), OkMV (Okra mosaic virus) and KYMV (Kennedya yellow mosaic virus). Alignment was obtained from the MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) and edited and displayed using the ALINE program [36]. The numbering of TYMV polyprotein is used here. Italics in the TYMV PRO sequence indicate the N-terminal part of the crystallized construct not visible in the electron density. Lower case letters denote the hexahistidine tag added for purification. The secondary structure of PRO is reported below the alignment. Structural elements belonging to the N-terminal lobe appear in black, those in the central lobe appear in gray and finally those in the C-terminal lobe in light gray. C, The three OTU DUBs TYMV PRO, yOTU1 (cellular OTU DUB, PDB code 3BY4) and vOTU (Bunyaviridae OTU DUB, PDB code 3PRP) are shown as ribbons without their substrates and in the same orientation after superposition by DALI. They are colored pink (PRO, middle panel), light orange (yOTU1, left panel) and light blue (vOTU, right panel). The segments leading to the catalytic cysteine are in green. The catalytic cysteine and histidine are displayed as red spheres. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003560.g001",
