To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated. A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61 days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six na\u00efve calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two na\u00efve calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA.",

Viral RNA was detected from days 1-27 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27 days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important respiratory pathogen in cattle, detrimentally affecting the economy and animal welfare. The virus is distributed worldwide and is a major pathogen of the bovine respiratory disease complex [1, 2] . Viral respiratory infections are also of concern with regards to antibiotic resistance, as they predispose cattle to secondary bacterial infections that are commonly treated with antibiotics [3] . Bovine respiratory disease is traditionally handled with management measures, vaccination and metaphylactic antibiotic treatment [4] . Another possible strategy is to prevent inter-herd transmission of the main pathogens by increasing biosecurity measures at herd level. Because live animal transport is considered one of the main modes of BRSV transmission between herds [5, 6] , proper mitigation must ensure that live animal transport be performed without compromising biosecurity. This requires knowledge on transmission risk associated with animal contact at different stages of infection. Knowledge of BRSV shedding related to clinical features would also be useful in order to assess the transmission risk of an infected herd without the use of viral diagnostic assays. For both of these areas, several knowledge gaps exists. Although way of infection may affect both viral shedding and clinical signs compared to naturally exposed animals, challenge studies are superior in the sense that aetiology and time of exposure is known and clinical features and virus excretion can be followed closely. Challenge studies, many of them aiming to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] seldom last longer than one to two weeks. Grissett et al. [12] and Gershwin [13] concluded that shedding of BRSV begins on day three or four post-infection (p.i.) and usually lasts until day nine or ten. Grissett et al. [12] summarized that the median time to appearance, peak and resolution of clinical signs was 3, 6 and 12 days, respectively, based on information from 22 inoculation studies [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . As studies outlasting the acute phase of infection are lacking, it is not known how long an animal can transmit infectious viruses to other animals. Appearance of clinical signs is usually the only information available in the field, and finding a clinical parameter that indicates shedding of infectious BRSV would be valuable. The existence of chronic or persistent infections in individuals is likewise still unclear [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

The intervention for SG was exposure to EG and their environment 27 days after first exposure to BRSV (D27). The read-out was presence of BRSV RNA, infective BRSV, anti-BRSV antibodies, clinical signs, weight gain and pathological lesions. Each single animal was used as its own control, mainly to detect whether the calves were clinically healthy, had an average weight gain and did not have antibodies against relevant respiratory viruses (BRSV, BCoV and BPIV3) before exposure to BRSV. The experiment was performed as an open-label trial, as blinding was not practically achievable. A timeline of the experimental period with an overview of interventions is provided in Fig. 1 .",

Only ten animals were included in the study. Although not ideal, the chosen study design is common in experimental infection studies in large animals [12] . This in contrast to other type of studies with traditional laboratory animals or more epidemical studies, e.g. natural infections in the field. There are several challenges related to the large size of the animals like the accessibility to experimental facilities of acceptable size and biosecurity level. It is also an economical aspect due to the high costs of housing in experimental facilities and to the cost of purchasing calves. The ethical aspect according to number of animals used is always of concern. Consequently, the present study is performed as a descriptive experimental infections study. The experimental setting allowed controlled conditions and control of time of exposure to BRSV, which is difficult to achieve under field conditions. Natural conditions were mimicked concerning host species, age, breed, feeding and social interaction with other calves. Several environmental factors for the calves are identified as risk factors of respiratory disease. Among these are low temperatures combined with wetness of the animals, dust, herd size, transport, shared housing between calves and adult cattle, large differences in age and commingling of many calves in the same pen [32, 33] . In the present experiment, most of these factors were not advisable or possible to implement, but a few mild stressors were introduced, such as moving animals and commingling with other calves (i.e., rearrangement during the experiment). The bedding was dry, leaving the animal rooms dustier than in an average herd. Although severe respiratory disease was observed, clinical symptoms might have been even more severe if the virus had been introduced to a regular cattle herd. A non-passaged BRSV strain obtained from a field outbreak of respiratory disease was used for inoculation, in order to avoid changes in virulence due to cultivation in cell lines. For the main calf group (EG), natural exposure to virus-shedding calves was used to mimic field conditions. Experimental studies usually include control groups where na\u00efve animals are kept in the same environment. However, due to biosecurity measures and room capacity, the present housing facilities did not allow for this. Therefore, each calf functioned as its own control, by using the period prior to the challenge as a control period.",

The two SG calves remained uninfected after commingling with EG calves and their environment four weeks after EG calves were exposed to BRSV. The number of calves was unfortunately too low to conclude if this would be valid in a real herd with a larger number of animals, Nevertheless, it would be interesting to investigate this further in a study with more animals included and a sequential study design. In a recent experimental infection study on BCoV [36] , a similar pattern was observed; RNA from BCoV was detected for approximately a month after infection, but the infectivity of the virus was found to be considerably shorter, lasting for up to 18 days. These results suggest that the same strategies can be applied to prevent inter-herd transmission for both bovine respiratory disease complex pathogens.",

The virus in the nasal swabs might reflect the presence of the inhaled virus, but no active BRSV infection. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus is a labile, enveloped virus and freezing and thawing can detrimentally affect infectivity [2, 37, 38] . As the amount of infective virus was unknown in the inoculate, it may have contained less infective virus than the amount the EG calves were exposed to. This might explain why inoculation led to a longer incubation period and less severe infection in IG calves. In addition, viral RNA was detected for a longer period of time in the EG calves. The late outbreak peak of clinical signs of the EG compared to earlier reports from experimental infections [12] might have been caused by a more prolonged process in a group of animals naturally exposed to BRSV. This adds to the view that studies based on natural exposure are more valid than inoculation studies.",

Comparison of the median values of the total clinical score and the BRSV RNA titer showed a clear conformity between the two parameters during the course of the trial. In general, the detection of replicating viral RNA occurred a few days before the onset of clinical signs. Rise in temperature and coughing is commonly used as a measure to detect respiratory disease in the field. In the present experiment, these parameters increased during the same time period as the number of BRSV genome copies raised. However, the coughing continued intermittently for a much longer period than viral RNA was detected. The median values of the rectal temperature score was only slightly elevated. Increased respiratory rate and nasal discharge appeared to be the clinical parameter corresponding best with the detection of viral RNA for the included calves. The clinical signs also corresponded well with the periods when an active BRSV infection was detected.

The negative results in the sentinel study further support the argument that BRSV infected animals and their housing environment pose a lower risk after three to four weeks. Combining this knowledge with the registration of clinical signs of respiratory disease, with an emphasis on the occurrence of increased respiratory rate, could be useful information when implementing preventive biosecurity measuressuch as periods of quarantine-to avoid spreading the virus. However, an experimental setting with relatively few animals of the same age will differ from the transmission dynamic in a regular herd. One of the challenges in a conventional herd setting is to know at which time point the virus has circulated throughout the whole herd. Since animals may develop subclinical infection, the time point when the last animals clear the infection will often be unknown. Despite the efforts in this experiment to mimic natural conditions, these factors must be considered when the results are applied in a herd.",

The period when infective viruses were found was shorter: between 13 and 19 days. The total clinical score, the increase in the respiratory rate and nasal discharge corresponded best with the shedding of viral RNA. Contact between EG calves and na\u00efve calves four weeks after exposure did not result in infection. EG calves were protected from reinfection seven weeks after initial exposure. This adds to our basic understanding of transmission patterns of BRSV, within-and between-herds, and can provide support for preventive action when used to design inter-herd biosecurity measures. ",
