Note that our extension of the Wallinga and Teunis method, which allows for negative diagnoses intervals, may allow \"cycles\", whereby A infects B and B infects A. However, the aim of the Wallinga and Teunis method, and of the extension we propose here, is not to reconstruct who infected whom per se, but rather to assess how many secondary cases, on average, a case infected or diagnosed at a given time will produce. In that sense, although p ij is described as the relative probability that i infects j, it should in fact be regarded as the relative probability that any case diagnosed the same year as i infects j (or any case infected the same year as j). This view highlights the fact that this method is only applicable to large networks. In that case, the cycle issue A infects B infects A translates into \"someone diagnosed the same year as A infects B and someone diagnosed same year as B infects A\", which is not an issue.",

            "text": "Overall, we conclude that, although a simple branching model with random sampling is unable to fully capture the complexity of our data, the model with geometric offspring distribution with R = 1 or slightly lower is reasonably well suited to describe our data. Under this model, the expected proportion of singletons and of small clusters is independent on the sampling fraction, so that the true proportion of singletons and small clusters is similar to the observed one despite partial sampling. Our observations show that 64% of clusters are singletons, and 29% are small (size 2-9), whilst the geometric model with mean offspring R = 1 leads to 50% of singletons and 31% of small clusters. This suggests that amongst all imported cases, only a small fraction (7% according to the observations, and 19% according to the model) will go on and establish a large cluster (i.e. 10 cases or more). , which is independent of . In particular the observed proportion of singletons for any value of is the same as the true proportion of singletons if all cases are observed (i.e. for = 1).",

These results confirm our main findings that transmissibility in recent clusters is greater than it was in older clusters.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION -PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSISNon-MSM majority transmission clustersFrom the phylogenetic tree of 8,320 HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences in total (S7 Fig), 106 large transmission clusters were identified that included sequences from \u226510 patients from the ATHENA cohort. Fifteen of the 106 clusters were not MSM majority clusters. Six of these 15 large clusters were dominated by sequences from patients living or born on the (former) Dutch Antilles. One cluster was a mixed Latin Caribbean cluster including also 5 'Los Alamos' sequences from the UK, and another one was the largest cluster in this study, containing 66% of all 207 sequences from drug-users in our study. Four clusters together included sequences from 69 heterosexually infected individuals (and 6 MSM) of Surinam origin, of which one also included 3 sequences from patients sampled in Suriname. Together, these four clusters included 43% of the 159 sequences from heterosexually infected individuals born in Suriname. Another cluster was found to include sequences from 6 persons who injected drugs (PWID) and 1 MSM, all of Polish origin, and also included Los Alamos sequences, 9 from Czech republic and 14 from Poland. This cluster included 30% of sequences from the Polish born people in this study, and all PWID born in Poland. Two other clusters had a mix of sequences from MSM and heterosexually infected individuals. Of the sequences from heterosexually infected patients in the Netherlands, 19% (194) were in 64 large MSM-dominated clusters, of these patients 129 (66%) were men, of whom 77% had a Dutch origin.",

This cluster consisted of in total 327 ATHENA sequences: 42% (136) sequences from PWID, 37% (122) from heterosexually infected individuals, and only 7% (24) from MSM. The earliest diagnosis in the cluster was a PWID in 1982. The latest recent infection through drug use was in 1999. The timed phylogenetic tree showed no evidence of transmission amongst PWID since 2000, i.e. the latest time point of the common ancestor of any two sequences from PWID.In 2010, the last year of this study, 4 heterosexually infected individuals, 2 PWID and one MSM were diagnosed in this cluster. The cluster also included 200 sequences from the Los Alamos comparison, of whom 91 from Italy and 38 from the United states. S1 table shows the results of Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS analysis)[2]. Significant clustering was found within PWID and heterosexual risk groups, but not amongst the MSM in this cluster. The sequences from the United States significantly clustered together at the root of the tree, whilst the Italian sequences were dispersed throughout the tree.Transmission clusters circulating on Cura\u00e7aoSix clusters included \u22655 sequences from patients registered on Cura\u00e7ao, a Caribbean island within the kingdom of the Netherlands. All 6 clusters included sequences from patients in the Netherlands and consisted of \u226510 sequences. The 6 clusters were confirmed by visual inspection of the whole phylogenetic tree and in a dated phylogenetic tree (S9Fig).In total, these six clusters included 33% (73) of sequences from 219 patients on the island. 35% (18) of MSM and 33% (48) of heterosexually infected patients with a sequence in this study. Diversification by risk group is visible. In total, the 6 clusters included sequences from 71 patients in the Netherlands, of whom 48% were born in the former Dutch Antilles. Diversification can be seen into MSM clusters within the Netherlands (two majority MSM). Besides these 6 large clusters, 51 sequences from patients on Cura\u00e7ao were identified as singletons (17%), 58 sequences were in 39 smaller clusters, and 37 sequences (14%) were in 23 clusters in the Netherlands. In total, this adds up to 119 (54%) clusters on the island, of which 5% (6) identified as on-going established transmission clusters.",

Interestingly, under the Geometric model, when R = 1, the expected proportion of observed singletons or small clusters is independent on the sampling fraction (see below for an analytical proof for the singletons). The figure also shows the proportion of singletons and small clusters observed in our analysis. The observed proportion of small clusters is well in line with the expected proportion under a geometric model with mean offspring R = 1.
