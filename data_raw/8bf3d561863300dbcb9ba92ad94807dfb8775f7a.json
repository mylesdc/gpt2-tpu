The aberrant activity of proteases can lead to various diseases; consequently, host proteases have been the focus of intense investigation as potential therapeutic targets. A wide range of viruses encode proteases which play an essential role in viral replication and, therefore, constitute attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics. There are numerous examples of successful drug development targeting cellular and viral proteases, including antivirals against human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. Most FDA-approved antiviral agents are peptidomimetics and macrocyclic compounds that interact with the active site of a targeted protease. Norovirus proteases are cysteine proteases that contain a chymotrypsin-like fold in their 3D structures. This review focuses on our group's efforts related to the development of norovirus protease inhibitors as potential anti-norovirus therapeutics. These protease inhibitors are rationally designed transition-state inhibitors encompassing dipeptidyl, tripeptidyl and macrocyclic compounds. Highly effective inhibitors validated in X-ray co-crystallization, enzyme and cell-based assays, as well as an animal model, were generated by launching an optimization campaign utilizing the initial hit compounds. A prodrug approach was also explored to improve the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the identified inhibitors.",

The HIV aspartic and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-4A serine protease are among the well-studied due to their significance in public health and successful antiviral drug development. Each HIV particle has two copies of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Upon infection of host cells, the HIV-1 genome is transcribed into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription, which is then integrated into the human genome. The HIV-1 virus utilizes the host cell machinery to replicate, producing virus particles. As viruses are released from host cells, they undergo maturation where viral structural polyproteins are cleaved by HIV-1 viral protease to produce infectious virus particles. The functional HIV protease is formed by two identical monomers of 99 amino acids. Each protease monomer contributes one catalytic aspartic acid (25 and 25' Asp) in the active site ( Figure 3A) , and the two conserved catalytic residues work together to process HIV-1 Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during viral maturation when new virus particles are released from cell membrane. The active site is covered by two flexible \u03b2-hairpin flaps ( Figure 3A ), which open to allow the substrates to enter the active site [8] . HIV-1 protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors at nine processing sites to produce mature proteins ( Figure 3B ) [8] . In general, a hydrophobic amino acid at P1 is required for efficient cleavage by HIV-1 protease, and the cleavage rates vary significantly based on the sequences in the P6 to P3' region [9, 10] .",

The HIV aspartic and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-4A serine protease are among the well-studied due to their significance in public health and successful antiviral drug development. Each HIV particle has two copies of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Upon infection of host cells, the HIV-1 genome is transcribed into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription, which is then integrated into the human genome. The HIV-1 virus utilizes the host cell machinery to replicate, producing virus particles. As viruses are released from host cells, they undergo maturation where viral structural polyproteins are cleaved by HIV-1 viral protease to produce infectious virus particles. The functional HIV protease is formed by two identical monomers of 99 amino acids. Each protease monomer contributes one catalytic aspartic acid (25 and 25' Asp) in the active site ( Figure 3A ), and the two conserved catalytic residues work together to process HIV-1 Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during viral maturation when new virus particles are released from cell membrane. The active site is covered by two flexible \u03b2-hairpin flaps ( Figure 3A ), which open to allow the substrates to enter the active site [8] . HIV-1 protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors at nine processing sites to produce mature proteins ( Figure 3B ) [8] . In general, a hydrophobic amino acid at P 1 is required for efficient cleavage by HIV-1 protease, and the cleavage rates vary significantly based on the sequences in the P 6 to P 3 ' region [9, 10] .",

The polyprotein is processed by cellular and viral proteases to generate at least 10 mature structural and non-structural proteins. HCV encodes an NS2-3 autoprotease and a NS3-4A serine protease. NS2-3 protease autocleaves the NS2 and NS3 junction and NS3-4A serine protease is responsible for cleavage at four junctions on viral polyproteins (NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, and NS5A-NS5B junctions), as well as cellular proteins that are involved in innate immunity. NS3 is comprised of protease (N-terminal,~200 aa) and helicase domains (C-terminal), and forms a heterodimer with NS4A (54-residue protein) [15, 16] . NS4A binds to the N-terminal region of NS3 and acts as a cofactor of the protease to enhance cleavage [15, 16] . NS3 forms a trypsin-like fold with two \u03b2-barrels and contains the catalytic triad residues (His57, Asp81 and Ser139) in the active site ( Figure 5 ). The cleavage sites by NS3-4A protease on the polyprotein are listed in Figure 5 [17] . The P 1 residue is accommodated in the S 1 pocket in the NS3-4A protease, and other residues flanking the pocket are important determinants of substrate recognition. The S 1 pocket of NS3 protease prefers small, hydrophobic residues (such as cysteine) at the P 1 position of its substrates [17] . HCV NS3-4A is known to have a shallow binding pocket requiring an extended subtrate spanning 10 amino acid residues (P 6 to P 4 ') for efficient enzyme activity. The consensus sequence for P 6 to P 1 ' is (D/E)XXXX(C/T)(A/S) for all trans-cleavage sites, with X being any amino acid. Commercially available HCV protease inhibitors include Telaprevir (Incivek) [18] , Boceprevir (Victrelis) [19] , Simeprevir, Grazoprevir, Voxilaprevir, Paritaprevir, and Glecaprevir [20] (Figure 6 ). These inhibitors are often used as part of combination therapy with other inhibitors, such as polymerase and NS5A inhibitors.

These inhibitors are often used as part of combination therapy with other inhibitors, such as polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. The macrocyclic compounds, shown in Figure 6 , display significantly improved EC 50 values over Telaprevir and Boceprevir, the first-generation protease inhibitors [20] (Figure 6 ). Both Boceptrevir and Telatrevir contain an \u03b1-ketoamide warhead, a small residue at the P 1 position, and a Pro or Pro surrogate at the P 2 position [18, 19] (Figure 6 ). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies with HCV protease inhibitors have demonstrated a preference for residues with small hydrophobic side chains such as ethyl, propyl and trifluoroethyl at the P 1 position and bulky substituents at the P 2 position for increased efficency. SAR studies utilizing different warhead groups in protease inhibitors have shown that an \u03b1-ketoamide warhead is preferred, resulting in up to a 40-fold improvement in binding affinity over the aldehyde counterpart [21] . Other warheads, such as trifluoromethyl or chloromethyl ketones, were found to be less effective [20] . The EC 50 values of these protease inhibitors ranged from 100 to 300 nM for Telatrevir and Boceprevir, and from 0.2 to 15 nM for the macrocyclic compounds in HCV replicon harboring cells, dependent on the virus genotypes used ( Figure 6 ).

The oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by the presence of an oxyanion hole adjacent to the norovirus 3CL Pro active site. The substrate specificity of norovirus 3CL Pro shows a strong preference for a D/E-F-X-L-Q-G-P sequence (where X is H, Q or V), corresponding to the subsites S 5 -S 4 -S 3 -S 2 -S 1 -S 1 '-S 2 ' (Figure 7B ).

These studies showed that although most of these warheads were active against norovirus 3CL Pro , the aldehyde warhead displayed superior activity (>3-5 fold) compared to other warheads. The high chemical reactivity of aldehyde warheads employed in the design of TS inhibitors is occasionally associated with a lack of selectivity, as well as off-target effects. Therefore, a latent aldehyde warhead, such as an aldehyde bisulfite adduct, which reverts to the precursor aldehyde under physiological conditions was utilized [37] . The pharmacological activity of the bisulfite adducts of peptidyl aldehydes was shown to be comparable to those of the precursor aldehydes [37] .",

These structures served as a guide for further development of potent dipeptidyl inhibitors. Using GC373 as a starting point [33] , optimization of R1 (accommodated in the S2 pocket) and R2 (accommodated in the S4 pocket) was conducted (Figure 8 ) [38] . The FRET assay using 3CL Pro of GI and GII noroviruses (IC50) and cell based assays (EC50) using NV replicon harboring cells revealed that replacing Leu at R2 with cyclohexylalanine (Cha) (GC543) increased potency significantly (IC50 600 nM to 300 nM and EC50 200 nM to 60 nM) (Figure 8 ) [38] , while the substitution of R2 with a m-Cl substituent further increased potency (IC50 100 nM and EC50 20 nM) (GC583) [38] . Co-crystal structures with each compound revealed the structural determinants that are responsible for the increase in potency (Figures 9): 1 ) a more extensive hydrogen bonding network is present relative to GC373; 2) the cyclohexyl ring is positioned tightly, optimally filling the hydrophobic S2 subsite of NV Pro; and 3) the m-chlorophenyl ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket near Ile109 and Val168 [38] . The EC50 values against MNV-1 were also found to be well correlated with the EC50 values in NV replicon harboring cells (HG23 cells): 3.5 \u00b5M, 0.6 \u00b5M, 0.08 \u00b5M for GC373, GC543 and GC583, respectively [38] . Additionally, SAR studies were performed to probe the hydrophobic S4 pocket of norovirus 3CL Pro and exploit favorable hydrophobic binding interactions [39] . Specifically, because the m-Cl benzyl moiety in GC583 projects toward the S4 subsite of the protease (Figure 9 ), its close proximity to a string of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala158, Ala160, Val168 and Ile109) was exploited through appropriate cap modifications, including the use of sulfonamide and lipid moieties [39] . The synthesized compounds displayed high potency in inhibiting norovirus replication in cells (EC50 up to 0.1 \u00b5M in replication in NV harboring cells or MNV-1) but did not increase the potency over GC583 [39] .

These structures served as a guide for further development of potent dipeptidyl inhibitors. Using GC373 as a starting point [33] , optimization of R 1 (accommodated in the S 2 pocket) and R 2 (accommodated in the S4 pocket) was conducted (Figure 8 ) [38] . The FRET assay using 3CL Pro of GI and GII noroviruses (IC 50 ) and cell based assays (EC 50 ) using NV replicon harboring cells revealed that replacing Leu at R 2 with cyclohexylalanine (Cha) (GC543) increased potency significantly (IC 50 600 nM to 300 nM and EC 50 200 nM to 60 nM) (Figure 8 ) [38] , while the substitution of R 2 with a m-Cl substituent further increased potency (IC 50 100 nM and EC 50 20 nM) (GC583) [38] . Co-crystal structures with each compound revealed the structural determinants that are responsible for the increase in potency ( Figure 9 ): (1) a more extensive hydrogen bonding network is present relative to GC373; (2) the cyclohexyl ring is positioned tightly, optimally filling the hydrophobic S 2 subsite of NV Pro; and (3) the m-chlorophenyl ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket near Ile109 and Val168 [38] . The EC 50 values against MNV-1 were also found to be well correlated with the EC 50 harboring cells (HG23 cells): 3.5 \u00b5M, 0.6 \u00b5M, 0.08 \u00b5M for GC373, GC543 and GC583, respectively [38] . Additionally, SAR studies were performed to probe the hydrophobic S 4 pocket of norovirus 3CL Pro and exploit favorable hydrophobic binding interactions [39] . Specifically, because the m-Cl benzyl moiety in GC583 projects toward the S 4 subsite of the protease (Figure 9 ), its close proximity to a string of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala158, Ala160, Val168 and Ile109) was exploited through appropriate cap modifications, including the use of sulfonamide and lipid moieties [39] . The synthesized compounds displayed high potency in inhibiting norovirus replication in cells (EC 50 up to 0.1 \u00b5M in replication in NV harboring cells or MNV-1) but did not increase the potency over GC583 [39] .

            "text": "Macrocyclic compounds frequently display good pharmacological activity and selectivity, enhanced permeability, and improved metabolic stability; consequently, there has been an intense interest in macrocyclic inhibitors and their utilization in drug discovery and development. The design rationale of macrocyclic norovirus 3CL Pro inhibitors entailed the following considerations: firstly, proteases are known to recognize their ligands in the \u03b2-strand conformation [40] ; therefore, macrocyclization is an effective way of pre-organizing a peptidyl transition-state mimic in a \u03b2-strand conformation suitable for binding to the active site of a protease [41] . This invariably increases affinity by reducing the loss of entropy upon inhibitor binding. Secondly, macrocyclization increases cellular permeability, particularly when the design includes the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, as well as proteolytic stability [42] . Thus, macrocyclization generally enhances drug-like characteristics [43] . For norovirus 3CL Pro , the plasticity of the S 3 subsite allows the design of macrocyclic inhibitors by tethering the P 1 Gln side chain to the P 3 residue side chain. Based on these considerations, our group synthesized and evaluated for the first time a series of novel classes of macrocyclic compounds for their antiviral effects against noroviruses ( Figure 10 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . These include (1) triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors [45] ; (2) oxadiazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors [47] ; and (3) macrocyclic inhibitors incorporating a methylene linker [46] (Figure 10 ). These non-optimized macrocyclic compounds were found to be cell permeable and displayed moderate inhibitory activity against NV 3CL Pro and viral replication in cells [44] [45] [46] [47] . Their EC 50 ranged between 2 to 100 \u00b5M in NV replicon harboring cells [44] [45] [46] [47] . X-ray co-crystallization with the macrocyclic compounds showed that, in some of the compounds, the number of hydrogen bonds between NV 3CL Pro and the inhibitors decreased in comparison with the non-macrocyclic dipeptidyl compounds arising from a major structural reorganization of the active site ( Figure 10 ). Pharmacological activity and cellular permeability were found to be dependent on the interplay of several factors, including the ring size, type of linker, and other structural determinants. considerations, our group synthesized and evaluated for the first time a series of novel classes of macrocyclic compounds for their antiviral effects against noroviruses ( Figure 10 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] .

Several tripeptidyl compounds were synthesized with a glutamine surrogate at the P 1 position and their effects on norovirus in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and cell-based assays were examined [49] . SAR studies with the tripeptidyl series of compounds showed that, like dipeptidyl inhibitors, a cyclohexyl alanine at the P 2 position increased potency [49] . In addition, the cellular permeability of the tripeptidyl compounds was dependent on the nature of the residue at the P 3 position. Compounds with a hydrophobic residue at P 3 (such as naphthyl alanine and Phe) were highly effective in the FRET and cell-based assays (the best compound was NPI52 with an EC 50 of 0.04 \u00b5M in the replicon harboring cells). Detailed structures and the efficacy of the tripeptidyl compound series are reported in our prior report [49] . Similar tripeptidyl compounds with acyclic amides [50] or a 6-membered lactam ring [51] at the P 1 position were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-norovirus effects. However, their efficacy was lower than that of NPI52 in enzyme-or cell-based assays [49] [50] [51] .",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by a virulent feline coronavirus and is highly fatal (100% fatality). In cats with FIP, granulomatous vasculitis and granuloma lesions composed mainly of virus-infected macrophages are found in various organs, leading to clinical signs, which may include characteristic bodily effusions. The absolute lymphopenia, a prominent feature of both experimental and natural infection of FIP, is associated with the massive apoptosis of uninfected T-cells and its appearance precedes clinical signs typical of FIP. Due to the conservation of 3C proteases from picornaviruses, and 3CL pro from caliciviruses and picornaviruses, most dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compound series were also effective against multiple viruses in these families [30] . Since GC376 (bisulfite adduct of corresponding aldehyde GC373) potently inhibits feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cell culture (EC 50 0.04 \u00b5M with FIPV 1146 strain) [52] , we determined the efficacy of GC376 against FIP in cats as a proof-of-concept study using experimentally-infected pathogen-free (SPF) cats and client-owned cats with natural infection with FIPV [53, 54] . These studies have demonstrated that (1) GC376 was well tolerated in the animals with up to 4-week continual treatments and (2) for the first time, drug-like small-molecule inhibitors (GC376-like molecules) of coronaviruses and noroviruses can serve as potential antiviral therapeutics.",

These are rationally designed transition-state inhibitors consisting of dipeptidyl, tripeptidyl and macrocyclic compounds. These highly effective inhibitors, validated by X-ray co-crystallization, enzyme and cell-based assays, as well as an animal model, were generated by an optimization campaign utilizing the initial hit compounds. These findings warrant further development of the cited series of compounds beyond preclinical testing.",
