This study had several limitations. First, the pre-2013 surveys had irregular survey periods and a different survey design from the post-2013 surveys in terms of participants, sample size, and survey sites, posing problems for reliable comparisons of survey results. Second, the representativeness could not be established because budget limits also sample sizes.
