            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV, is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated host-virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the ''BASC-microRNome'' with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA-mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors, miRNAs, and BASCs in SARS pathway, which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall interplay leading to disease progression. Our observation reveals the BASCs (Sca-1+ CD34+ CD45-Pecam-), a subset of Oct-4+ ACE2+ epithelial colony cells at the broncho-alveolar duct junction, to be the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection. Upregulated BASC miRNAs-17*, -574-5p, and -214 are co-opted by SARS-CoV to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place. Viral Nucleocapsid and Spike protein targets seem to co-opt downregulated miR-223 and miR-98 respectively within BASCs to control the various stages of BASC differentiation, activation of inflammatory chemokines, and downregulation of ACE2. All these effectively accounts for a successful viral transmission and replication within BASCs causing continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair. Overall, this investigation reveals another mode of exploitation of cellular miRNA machinery by virus to their own advantage.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new fulminant atypical pneumonia which emerged as a regional and global threat in 2002-2003 with a high mortality rate resulting from acute lung failure [1] . The disease causing agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus termed as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2, 3] . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing a single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome which encodes 14 putative open reading frames encoding 28 potential proteins [4, 5] . These include four structural proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [4] . These proteins have various roles in aiding the virus to enter the host and spread infection. While the incidence of new cases of SARS waned in 2003-2004, many aspects of SARS disease pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions remain unsolved. Limited pathologic studies reveal that the major site of SARS-CoV infection and morbidity is the respiratory tract. The target organ of SARS is mainly lungs [6] . Among the various animal models that have been used to study the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection, the monkey model mimics the clinical course of SARS to a certain degree [7] . The cellular tropism of SARS-CoV in mouse lung has also been investigated by Ling et al., 2006 [8] . But still today, very little is known regarding the mode of SARS-CoV interaction with host cells at the onset of infection in the lungs at a molecular level, and also the cell types in which the primary viral infection and replication occurs.",

Further, SARS + cells are distinct from cells expressing the macrophage/monocyte specific marker CD68. But SARS + cells are found to express the functional receptor ACE2 as well as the stem/progenitor cell marker CD34 and Oct-4 [23] . Chen et al have also shown that SARS + cells are CD45 2 . Hence it has been confirmed that the SARS + cells in the infected lung were a subset of putative stem/ progenitor cells expressing CD34, Oct-4 and ACE2. Further, it is unlikely for SARS + cells to produce differentiated cell markers. The presence of SARS + cells within the multiple cell types at the bronchiolar lining layers makes it difficult to isolate SARS + cells. Some of the SARS + cells remains overlapped with adjacent cytokeratin + cells which might be mistakenly interpreted as colocalized cells. In such a situation BASC (Sca-1 + CD34 + CD45 2 Pecam 2 ) in terminal bronchioles located exclusively at the broncho-alveolar duct junction (BADJ) stands a good selection to be investigated as the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection.",

Interestingly, miRNAs-17*, -574- Normally presence of such host miRNA targets in SARS-CoV genome indicates that the corresponding miRNAs are a part of the host's innate antiviral defense. On the contrary, the RNA virus coopt host-miRNAs to suppress their own replication to evade immune elimination and establish a strong infection. It has been found that human infecting single-stranded RNA viruses are enriched for target sequences of human miRNAs [42] . Or else rapidly evolving RNA viruses might evolve targets that match host miRNAs in order to increase their host specificity. It is very likely that the rapidly evolving virus take advantage of slowly evolving host miRNAs to increase their survival in the host, analogous to the manner in which viruses take advantage of other cellular processes. Co-option of host miRNAs by SARS-CoV to suppress their own replication will allow it to be in a latent state and escape the host immune system at the initial time point of transmission and infection. Once successful transmission within the host system takes place, antiviral miRNA target sequences in the virus can be expected to mutate rapidly to maximize mismatches and thus minimize the impact of 'antiviral' miRNAs. Rapid mutation in SARS-CoV is supported by the fact that SARS-CoV lack proof reading activity in their polymerases.

But the targets for downregulated miR-148a within ORF1a, M, S and E might escape repression and maintain replication at a lower rate. Further, the exclusive miRNAs viz. miR-223 and -98 for N and S protein respectively are highly downregulated (8.7 fold and 5.6 fold respectively) in BASCs. N and S proteins are important for viral transmission in host.

The role of S protein as a transcription factor has obliged us to think that they might play a role to activate the miRNA promoters of miR-186,-93 and -200b targeting ACE2 to enhance their expression resulting in a reduced expression of ACE2 in an infected host. Whether this decrease in ACE2 expression is a result of miRNA mediated gene silencing controlled by S-protein will be an interesting and compelling question for further study.",

Oct-4 plays a crucial role towards regulating the chromatin structure in a state consistent with selfrenewal and later facilitating the expression of genes that keeps the cell poised to respond to cues that lead to differentiation. Hence this is one of the essential factors which control the state of differentiation in BASCs. Furthermore, it has a significant role in apoptosis. miR-146b-5p is seen to target Oct-4 in normal BASCs. The downregulated expression of this miRNA explains for the uninterrupted expression of Oct-4 resulting its normal function in an uninfected cell.

The most unique and significant property of it is revealed in its ability to act as a sequence specific DNA binding factor. It has been reported to bind NFkB response element of COX2 promoter and enhance COX2 gene expression [49] which effectively is beneficial for its existence within the host. This reveals the power of the N-protein to manipulate the entire gene expression programme of the infected cell. The common miRNAs, miR-214,-574-5p and -17* having targets in N protein are upregulated in BASCs. But miR-223, the unique miRNA targeting N-protein is highly downregulated. This signifies that the Nprotein targets corresponding to miR-223 is going to escape miRNA-mediated downregulation at the onset of infection (See Figure 4) . Further it seems that N-protein plays a role in interfering with the expression modulation of Oct-4 by binding to the promoter of miR-146-5p and controls the different stages of BASC differentiation as well as prevents apoptosis of SARS infected cells. Stem Cell Antigen-1 is identified as a potential marker for BASCs located at the BADJ [12, 27] .",

While acute inflammatory responses are generally beneficial in nature and have been shown to limit virus replication in situ, prolonged, uncontrolled inflammation has been recognized as a significant component contributing to the pathological sequelae to the morbidity and mortality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [44] . A histopathologic analysis of SARS-CoV infected lung in mice showed that there has been an induction of significant changes in the expression levels of the chemokine receptor CCR1 which acts as receptors for CCL3 and CCL5. The expression levels of these inflammatory chemokines were increased by viral infection of the lung [33] . It has been shown that CCR1 play an essential role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in lung-injury models [34] .

Or in another way we may say that the virus encodes the target of miR-223 to escape the RNAi mediated repression and at the same time takes advantage of the effect of induction of the inflammatory chemokine responses to accelerate lung fibrosis. But the controlled expression of target CCR1 in an uninfected cell inspite of the significantly low expression of its corresponding miR-223 in BASCs suggest that there must be a cascaded fine tuned interaction masterminded by the virus which is going on within the infected cell. It is known that N protein activates NF-KB in Vero E6 cells [38] . CCR1 is one of the target genes of NF-KB which is activated at a later stage [56] . Hence, we propose that within BASCs, reduced expression of miR-223 helps N protein to enter the host cell. On successful entry, N protein might be using miR-223 once again to activate CCR1 via NF-KB at its replicative stage to enhance lung fibrosis and at the same time gets empowered to manipulate the entire gene expression of the host cell by controlling the expression of Oct-4. The exact mechanism of such miRNA-mediated events needs further investigation. Further, checking the expression levels of N-protein, CCR1 as well as miR-223 in an infected BASC will provide a more compact conclusion.",

SARS-CoV enters the host; infects the BASCs of the lungs and controls its developmental stages via the molecular switches-miRNAs. Co-option of host miRNAs by viruses reveal their intelligent plan to control their replication in order to evade immune elimination until they undergoes successful transmission and establish a strong infection. Thereafter, they undergo rapid mutation to maximize the target-miRNA mismatches and enhance their replication before the cell reaches at a fully differentiated state. On successful replication, the virus infects resident, infiltrating, and circulating immune cells. The circulating immune cells carry the virus to other organs and causes damages to the immune cells of spleen, peripheral and central lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. The immune defense being weakened significantly, leads to rapid deterioration of the pneumonia. It is worth to test these cells for the expression of Oct-4 and ACE2 for further confirmatory conclusion.",

The potential therapeutic effect of modulating host-miRNA levels is also worth considering. This emerging picture of miRNA regulation in SARS-CoV infected individual will make the host-virus interaction far richer and more complex than the crisp linear pathways of the previous decade, with miRNAs participating in executive decisions at the interesting and vulnerable nodes in regulatory networks. By boosting the level of the host virus-specific miRNAs, it might be possible to turn what was a desirable outcome for the virus into a desirable outcome for the patient. Under the current hypothesis, we would predict that decreasing the level of host virus-specific miRNAs would result in promotion of viral replication, leading to immunological recognition and clearance of the virus by the host immune system. Further, increasing the level of miRNAs exclusive for the N and S protein might also block viral entry. However, manipulating the level of host miRNAs could have unintended consequences because the physiological functions of the miRNAs might be altered or viral pathology might be enhanced. Further silencing of miRNAs with antagomirs specifically within the infected cell could become another therapeutic strategy where miRNAs participate in disease aetiology. Nevertheless, these potential interventions merit further evaluation.",
