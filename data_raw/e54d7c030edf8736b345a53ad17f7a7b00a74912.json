Results: the five technical documents reviewed recommend that the CSD cleaning area should have a negative differential ambient air pressure, but scientific articles on the impact of this intervention were not found. The four articles included talked about aerosols formed after the use of a ultrasonic cleaner (an increased in the contamination especially during use) and pressurized water jet (formation of smaller aerosols 5\u03bcm). In a study, the aerosols formed from contaminated the hot tap water with Legionella pneumophila were evaluated. Conclusions: there is evidence of aerosol formation during cleanup activities in CSD. Studies on occupational diseases of respiratory origin of workers who work in CSD should be performed.",

            "text": "It was defined as the guiding question of this review: Formation of aerosols occurs during cleaning activities of MD, and what is the impact of negative air pressure in the dispersion of these to adjacent areas? Inclusion criteria were defined as the PICO strategy as follows: P (Patients) = health professionals or MD cleaning professionals; I (Intervention) = negative pressure; C (Comparison) = normal atmospheric pressure; O (Outcome) = dispersion of aerosols. After an initial search in major databases and query in the manuals and guidelines, we identified the lack of studies, both experimental and field, published specifically regarding the CSD. Therefore, it was defined as inclusion criteria: a. Studies published in full, regardless of the publication date and language; b. Clinical studies, experimental studies, guidelines, manuals and national and international technical standards; c. Studies that reported data on the justification for the presence of negative differential ambient air pressure in MD cleaning area; consultation of experts in the field of air treatment methods in Health System was held with the clinical engineers and professionals from the Brazilian Association of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating -(ABRAVA in Portuguese). These experts were asked about the scientific evidence of the need for negative differential ambient air pressure in CSD, which indicated guidelines, manuals and national and international technical standards for consultation. These documents were accessed through the websites of organizations such as the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). The documents that were not available on the Internet were obtained from the documentation center of ABRAVA, such as technical standards and booklets of: Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Initially, to search for scientific articles, consultations were held on portal descriptors encyclopedias (MeSH -Medical Subject Headings do PUBMED) and (\"CINAHL Titles\" -Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), to identify descriptors related to the inclusion criteria. However, to ensure access to all potentially eligible studies, keywords were also used. Therefore, the following descriptors were selected: equipment and supplies; health personnel; ventilation; air pressure; aerosols; atmospheric pressure. And the keywords: devices; health worker; negative pressure; HVAC system (heating ventilation and air conditioning); bioaerosol; airborne; droplet; droplet nuclei. As a search strategy, the website and databases were consulted as follows: PUBMED and SCOPUS -the controlled descriptors of MESH were primarily used in a single search box. In CINAHL -through the feature \"CINAHL Titles\" preferably with the expanded definition of the term, with the search first being carried out with all titles separately and later combining the titles using the Boolean operators. In the Web of Science -the controlled descriptors of MESH and synonym keywords were used. Access to Embase was restricted in the country at the time of data collection. Filters were not used in the bases and the Boolean AND operator was used to cross the data between the descriptors of the PICO strategy. The OR operator was used to descriptors or synonyms keywords. The search was carried out between March and April 2015, and updated in June of the same year. The search strategies were built with the help of a librarian expert in database. Given the scarcity of scientific articles detected initially, it was decided to conduct a comprehensive search, a large number of articles being found with crossings. The titles and summaries of them were read, identifying potentially eligible articles. Thus, 68 articles were read in full by two of the authors of this review, individually, which evaluated whether the articles corresponded to the established inclusion criteria. If there were no correlation, the authors recorded the reason for the exclusion. A third researcher was consulted when there were doubts and disagreements. The manual search step was the consultation of all technical document references (when mentioned), of the included articles and non-systematic reviews read in its entirety in order to identify other potentially eligible studies. The articles selected according to the inclusion criteria were analyzed separately by two reviewers. After the critical reading, reviewers completed a table, prepared by two of the authors of this review in Microsoft Excel, considering the concerned matter. The table was composed of the following items: identification of the article; objective, study outline; study site; aerosolizing mechanism; presence or absence of negative air pressure environment; type of statistical analysis; main results; main conclusions; recommendations for their practice; and finally limitations of the studies. Because of gaps in the methodological descriptions and results, it was necessary to consult a third reviewer to discuss the doubts of all articles. After establishing a consensus among reviewers, a final table with all the relevant data extracted from the studies was prepared. The risk of bias was assessed according to the design of each study. Due to the heterogeneity of the articles, it was decided to present the results descriptively. Since laboratory experimental studies are not included in the reference classification of evidence, studies of this review were classified as inconclusive, partly conclusive and conclusive, considering the guiding question of this review.ResultsFive technical documents and four scientific articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed.

Samples from surfaces on nine points around the washer (before and after collecting air samples) and from the cleaning solution (10ml) were collected. By analyzing the four moments of air collection, higher average of colonies per ft3 were found during the operation of the washer. Andwhen compared to the results of the samples with and without a lid, statistically significant differences were found, with larger numbers of colonies related to the operation with the lid, which means aerosols formed exclusively by the operation of the washer. The results of surface samples were not influenced by the aerosol, because there was no correlation between the number of colonies found before and after the operation of the washing machine. The authors suggest that surface contamination is related to cleaning solution leakage and dripping during the insertion and removal of the MD, regardless of the washer being with or without the lid. There was no apparent correlation between the contamination of the air and the cleaning solution. The authors indicated that the ultrasonic cleaner should be used with the lid to minimize the release of aerosols to the environment. Regarding the formation of aerosols from automatic washers with pressurized water, in a study (13) , surface cleaning was performed (wall) with an intentionally contaminated prepared solution of organic food components added with microorganisms (Serratia marcescens; spores of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus positive coagulase, Mycobacterium smegmatis and a bacteriophage virus). The size of the aerosols generated after the use of a pressurized automatic washer and cleaning with stiff bristle brush were compared. In addition, we evaluated the number of viable infected one day prior to the collection of air samples, that occurred immediately before, during and after the spraying of the cleaning solution / disinfection, through two types of air collectors: Andersen sampler six stages (size evaluation of the particles) and May air sampler (impingers -quantitative evaluation). It was observed that after using the washer with pressurized water and the collection with the Andersen sampler for 15 to 30 seconds, the number of colonies in the aerosol was greater compared to brushing (24,565 and 1628, respectively). Furthermore, 45.5% of the particles formed after the washer with pressurized water correspond to the third and sixth stages of the gatherer (up to 6\u03bcm) and after brushing, 27.6%; therefore, aerosols generated by the washer were smaller. For all the pathogens, the number of viable microorganisms per liter of air collected were higher during the cleaning procedures, when compared to the numbers after completion. When compared with washing only with water, all the cleaning solutions / disinfection reduced the number of viable microorganisms in aerosols and the peracetic acid solution was proved to be more effective.",

It was found that aerosols are inevitably generated during the MD cleaning activities, emphasizing the importance of the use of PPE among cleaning room workers. Because of the risk of the deposition of contaminant particles, this data reinforces the need for decontamination of surfaces touched associated with the hand hygiene of professionals. Considering the aerosols generated during the operation of the ultrasonic cleaner, it is recommended to use it with the lid closed. Conclusion Scientific evidence showed that aerosols are generated during cleaning activities and use of devices found in CSD such as the ultrasonic cleaner and the washer with pressurized water. Although the need for a negative differential ambient air pressure between the cleaning area and adjacent areas in CSD is standardized, no studies evaluating its impact on the dispersion of aerosols were found, which could compromise the safety of the material in the preparation room and the health of the cleaning room professionals and the ones that circulate in the adjacent areas. The studies have not provided information regarding the occupational health of workers in the surrounding areas, but there are strong indications for the use of the N95 mask by cleaning area workers. It demonstrates the need to conduct research on the occurrence of occupational diseases in the workers of CSD.",

The incidence of Pontiac fever in this population was 0.11 cases/people/year (95% CI 0:07 to 0:15). Of the 32 reported cases, 29 had been exposed to contaminated water. Considering these data, the water of hot water taps contaminated in the CSD can lead to the formation of aerosol with Legionella pneumophilla.In summary of the results of this review, it was found that air contamination by aerosol was higher during the cleaning procedure or while the tap was turned on(13)(14)(15) , returning to baseline levels after these procedures were completed . These data confirm theneed to use respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE) by professionals responsible for cleaning products on CSD. The RDC 15/2002 (7) determines that the reception area and cleaning worker must wear a mask or face shield, goggles, gloves, long sleeve waterproof aprons, ear protection and closed footwear. However, there is no description of the type of mask. Considering the results presented in this review as the size of the aerosols formed, suggests the use of N95 mask (a mask that has the capacity to filter particles <3\u03bcm) in the mentioned areas (2,13) , although no studies have assessed the risk of disease transmission via aerosol generated in cleaning activities. It is known that, in the chain of transmission of infections, there is need for interaction between the elements: host susceptibility, presence, source, input port and output of the infectious agent and a vehicle of transmission, in addition to the amount of it. Therefore, the risk of CSD employees, or other areas of health services being infected by aerosols vary fundamentally according to the elements of infection transmission chain",
