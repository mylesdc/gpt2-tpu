LDL could be oxidized by various stimuli but any chronic inflammatory environment further promotes LDL oxidation. Thus traditional herbal medicines that have been proved to be anti-inflammatory can be a good resource to prevent or ameliorate atherosclerosis. Since treatment of THP-1 cells with PMA induces differentiation into macrophages, this cell line is widely used for atherosclerotic research [15] . CD11b is induced not only in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells but also in oxidized LDL-stimulated mouse monocytes in vivo [18] . It forms a noncovalently linked heterodimer with the common \u03b2subunit CD18 and binds to various adhesion molecules in the endothelial cells and extracellular matrix, therefore mediating the migration and adhesion of cells during monocyte differentiation [11, 26] .

CD36, one of the class B scavenger receptors, is distributed in a variety of cells including platelets, cells with hematopoietic origin, adipocytes, and endothelial cells [28] . The expression of SRA and CD36 can be differentially controlled. Peroxisome-proliferatoractivated \u03b3, a transcription factor that is involved in lipid metabolism and monocyte differentiation, influences the expression of CD36, but not of SRA [29] . The different response of SRA and CD36 genes to CWE treatment indicate that CWE may separately affect PMA-activated signaling pathways that express these genes. It should be noted here that inhibition of acetyl LDL uptake in THP-1 cells by CWE was more marked than that of SRA and CD36 expression. A similar effect was observed in peritoneal macrophages of which scavenger receptors had already occupied before CWE treatment. We postulate that since CWE is likely to have high molecular weight polysaccharides, it may have some activity that competitively binds with scavenger receptors, as does fucoidan.",

PMA treatment causes cell cycle arrest in THP-1 cells through the upregulation of p21, a negative regulator of cyclin dependent kinases [32] ; the increased expression of p21 is due to the generation of ROS and PKC-mediated ERK1/2 activation. ROS inhibitors are reported to inhibit the level of SRA gene expression and acetyl LDL uptake in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells [17] . This may explain why some antioxidants reduce atherosclerosis [33] . Cinnamon has antioxidant hydrophilic polyphenols such as catechin, epicatechin, and tannins [6, 34] . Our previous study showed that the high molecular fraction of CWE (over 10 kDa) occupied most of its phenolics and was responsible for its inhibitory effect on LPS-induced ERK1/2 and other inflammatory signaling molecules [1] . The same components in CWE may exert a similar effect on PMAmediated ERK1/2 activity. However, the inhibition of SRA and other surface molecules by CWE cannot be fully accounted for by its effect on ERK1/2 because effective inhibitory concentration ranges are different.",
