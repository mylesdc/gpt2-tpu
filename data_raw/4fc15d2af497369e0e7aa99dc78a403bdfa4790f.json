Antigenic variation of PfEMP1 plays a key role in malaria pathogenesis, a process partially controlled at the level of var gene transcription. Transcriptional levels, throughout the intra-erythrocytic cycle, of 59 var genes of the NF54 clone were measured simultaneously by quantitative real-time PCR. The timing of var transcript abundance, the number of genes transcribed and whether transcripts were correctly spliced for protein expression were determined. Two parasite populations were studied; an unselected population of NF54 and a selected population, NF54VAR2CSA, to compare both the transcription of var2csa and the expression pattern of the corresponding protein.",

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is a group of variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, thus enabling the parasite to sequester in various endothelial tissues of the host and avoid clearance in the spleen [1, 2] . Several receptors have been identified as mediators of the sequestration, e.g. CD36 [3] , thrombospondin [4] and ICAM-1, associated with cerebral malaria [5] and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), the main receptor in the placenta and associated with pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) [6] . PfEMP1 are encoded by the highly diverse var gene family and each parasite genome harbours ~60 of these genes [7] [8] [9] . The var gene repertoire of the 3D7 parasite [10] can be sub-grouped into three major groups (A, B and C), two intermediate groups (B/A and B/C), and the var1csa and var2csa sub-families based on promoter regions and chromosomal locations [11, 12] .",

            "text": "VSA appear to be the main target of antibodies conferring protective immunity against malaria [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, antigenic diversity and var gene switching have made unambiguous identification of the PfEMP1 molecules that are responsible for specific adhesion phenotypes difficult. A quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT PCR) method was developed to measure the amount of mRNA being transcribed from 59 different NF54/3D7 var genes simultaneously [18] . Using this approach, a particular PfEMP1, VAR2CSA, was identified as the parasite ligand likely to be responsible for CSA binding in the placenta [18, 19] . In another study using the same method, the group A var genes of 3D7 were associated with severe malaria [20, 21] . However, correlating expression of var genes to the phenotype of a parasite population can yield equivocal results, and studies on var gene transcription have given conflicting results regarding both the number of var genes being transcribed and the size of these transcripts. Two reverse transcription (RT)-PCR studies suggested that most or all var genes are transcribed in ring-stage parasites, whereas in mature trophozoites all but one var gene was silenced. Only the var gene actively transcribed in late stages would then be translated into protein to confer the phenotype [22, 23] . Other studies have proposed that multiple full-length var transcripts are present in ringstage parasites but not in mature stages, with the exception of the var1csa gene which was detectable in both trophozoites and later stages [24, 25] . A third group of studies detected multiple full-length transcripts in ring-stage and mature trophozoite parasites in both clonal populations [26] and in single cells [27] .",

This resulted in a synchronous population of parasites with more than 99% late-stage trophozoites and schizonts. Timing of parasite reinvasion was deter-mined by counting the percentage of ring-stage parasites of 300 infected erythrocytes on thin smears stained by Giemsa ( Figure 2 ). For RNA extractions, each parasite line was cultured in 26 different culture flasks at 1% hematocrit (50 \u03bcl packed red blood cells) with ~10% parasitaemia after reinvasion. This was done to minimize handling time of the parasite cultures at other time points than during harvesting. The culture was centrifuged and 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) was added to the pellet to preserve RNA. For flow cytometry assays eight different culture flasks were prepared for each isolate. Since separation of ring stages from uninfected erythrocytes is difficult, these cultures were prepared at 0.25% haematocrit with approximately 25% parasitaemia observed after reinvasion to allow for direct staining and flow cytometric analysis.",

However, after repeated selection, the var2csa gene has become the overwhelmingly dominant transcript and constitutes >98% of all detected var transcripts. This pattern of exclusive expression of the var2csa gene ( Figure  1C ) supports the general model of mutually exclusive transcription of var genes. Such a general model was proposed after experiments showed that exclusive transcription of activated group B and C 5' UTR promoters occurred following transfection [33, 34] . It is likely that a significant proportion of the unselected ring-stage NF54 is exclusively expressing the dominant group B var transcript. However, this is not as apparent in this line as in the NF54VAR2CSA due to the heterogeneity of this unselected population. While it remains to be proven that var transcription in circulating parasites in the bloodstream can always be correlated to the binding phenotype of the corresponding trophozoite population, this study supports such a conclusion. Another recent study has shown that the genotypes of the circulating ring-stage parasites represent the types of the mature parasites sequestering in most tissues [35] .",

In this study, cross-intron primers for three different var genes, var2csa (PFL0030c), a group B gene (PFL0935c) and a group C gene (PFD0615c) all showed splicing of exon I to exon II in both the unselected and VAR2CSA-selected NF54 parasites throughout the whole cycle, indicating that these var genes are normally expressed as correctly spliced transcripts ( Figure 4 ). The fact that the transcription levels of the four different var2csa-specific primers were tightly correlated further indicates that the transcripts are not only correctly spliced but also probably full-length at all stages. This is contrary to a conclusion drawn in an earlier study in which a difference between the levels of transcription detected by cross-intron primers and exon I primers of some var genes using Q-RT PCR were reported [38] . This discrepancy could be due to the 'amplification bias' of the cross-intron primers, and the difficulties of designing unique primers targeting the exon II. However it is worth noting that promiscuous transcription in any form is incompatible with transfection experiments showing the exclusive expression of a single var gene regulated at a pre-transcriptional level [33, 34, 39, 40] .",

This observation is most simply explained by a var1csa-expressing subpopulation of NF54 having been removed by VAR2CSA selection.

In these experiments, transgenic parasite lines use a var promoter to drive expression of a drug resistance gene rather than a PfEMP1 protein. Drug selection followed by cloning and analysis of resistant lines indicates that the transfected recombinant promoter is activated in these lines and that all other var promoters are silenced. There is disagreement as to whether a single active var promoter is sufficient to silence all other promoters [34] or whether the system of allelic exclusion requires both the 5' var promoter and a promoter located downstream in the var gene intron to interact in some way to silence transcription [43, 44] .",

The relatively constitutive transcription of var1csa may result from a dysfunction of the transcriptional regulation related to the cell cycle. As var1csa has an upstream promoter but is truncated at exon I, it can be hypothesized that its 5' UTR promoter, as previously demonstrated [34] is needed for exclusive transcription of a single var gene whereas the intron/exon II/ 3' UTR is needed for the observed wave shaped transcriptional regulation throughout the cell cycle. Yet, the abundance profile of var1csa during the complete intra-Total number of var transcripts in NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA Figure 3 Total number of var transcripts in NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA. Total var transcription is shown as relative copy number for both NF54 and NF54VAR2CSA. Total var transcription of both populations corresponds to the expression of the most abundant transcript, PFL0935c and var2csa (PFL0030c), respectively. The most striking difference in transcription is the slightly earlier distinctive peak for var2csa (PFL0030c) in NF54VAR2CSA compared to the broader wave-like appearance of var transcription in NF54.

The protein expression of VAR2CSA did not seem to diverge from earlier reports showing that PfEMP1 molecules appear to be present on the infected erythrocyte membrane around 16-18 hours after invasion [45] [46] [47] .
