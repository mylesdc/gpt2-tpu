            "text": "Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of double membrane vesicles, which are the sites of RNA replication. Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs per se, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.

However, the cellular proteins required and the cellular pathways hijacked by viruses have hardly been elucidated. All positive-strand RNA viruses assemble in infected cells their replication complexes (RCs) in association with intracellular membranes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . The induction of such local microenvironments is likely advantageous for the virus, as membrane association may facilitate the recruitment of both the viral and cellular components involved in RNA replication. Alternatively, membrane association may provide a shielded environment that prevents the activation of, or protects against, antiviral host cell responses like those mediated by interferon.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales. Upon translation of the viral genomic RNA, two very large polyproteins (approximately 4,000 and 7,000 amino acids) are synthesized, the autoproteolytic cleavage products of which collectively form the RCs. These RCs are associated with double membrane vesicles (DMVs [6, 7, 8] ), which appear as cytoplasmic foci when analyzed by fluorescence light microscopy and increase in number during the course of the infection [6, 8, 9, 10] . It is plausible that the nonstructural viral proteins (nsps) mediate the formation of DMVs by modifying intracellular membranes and by recruiting cellular components to their need. Recent studies suggest the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to be the lipid donor compartment of the membrane-bound coronavirus RCs [10, 11, 12, 13] , although colocalization of nsps with markers for endosomes, Golgi and autophagosomes has also been described [7, 10, 14, 15, 16] .",

This drug inhibits the activation of ADPribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases by targeting the large guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) GBF1 (Golgi-specific resistance factor 1), and BIG (BFA-inhibited GEF) 1 and 2 [21, 22, 23] . More specifically, BFA locks ARF*GDP when bound to GEF, thereby blocking the GEF activity at an early stage of the reaction, prior to guanine nucleotide release [24, 25] . The large GEFs function in the ER to Golgi transport pathway [26] and localize to the cis-(GBF1) and trans-sides (BIG1 and BIG2) of the Golgi complex [27] . The cellular effectors of these GEFs, ARFs, are divided into three classes: Class I (ARF1-3), Class II (ARF 4 and 5), and Class III (ARF6) [28] . Class I ARFs regulate the assembly of coat complexes onto vesicles budding from compartments along the secretory pathway and activate lipid-modifying enzymes (reviewed in [29, 30] ). While the function of Class II ARFs remains largely unclear, the Class III ARF6 is thought to regulate endosomal membrane traffic [31, 32] . GBF1 and the BIGs are likely to activate distinct subclasses of ARFs at specific locations in order to regulate different types of transport routes [27] .",

In the presence of this drug, poliovirus replication sites were not formed and RNA replication was completely blocked [41, 43] . Remarkably, other members of the picornavirus family appeared to differ in their sensitivity to BFA.

Recently, we demonstrated the important role of the ER in the generation of the RCs. While MHV nsp4 was localized to this organelle when expressed alone, it was recruited to the replication complexes in infected cells [11] . Furthermore, coronaviral replication was inhibited when the ER export machinery was blocked by use of the kinase inhibitor H89 or by expression of a dominant active mutant of Sar1 [11] . Other cellular proteins and pathways are likely to contribute to the formation of the coronavirus RCs as well. Here, we studied the involvement of BFA-sensitive pathways in MHV replication and RC formation. Our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication. Moreover, together with our recent observation about the relevance of the ER in the same process, our data reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication are intimately connected.",

Indeed, after treatment of the cells with 5 mg/ml BFA for 1 h, the typical Golgi staining pattern of GM130 was lost, concomitant with a reticular redistribution of the protein marker (data not shown). Next, we tested whether MHV infection was sensitive to BFA. Therefore, LR7 cells were inoculated with a luciferase-expressing recombinant of MHV-A59 (MHV-EFLM) in the presence or absence of 5 mg/ml BFA. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated either in the presence or in the absence of BFA. At 7 h p.i., the intracellular luciferase expression level was determined relative to untreated cells. Luciferase expression was inhibited more than 95% when BFA was present from 1-7 h p.i., whereas BFA treatment during virus inoculation had only a minor effect on reporter gene expression (Fig. 1A) . Although this latter decrease might have resulted in part from a reduced entry, the negative effect of BFA on MHV replication and transcription is evident from the profoundly impaired MHV reporter gene expression when BFA was added post inoculation (1-7 h p.i.).",

To this end, a similar experiment as shown in Fig. 1A was performed, in which the amount of intracellular genomic viral RNA was determined by real-time Taqman PCR. As for the luciferase expression levels, the amount of genomic RNA was found to be severely reduced when BFA was added directly after the virus inoculation (Fig. 1B) , whereas a less profound effect was observed when cells were treated during virus inoculation. Very similar results were obtained when targeting the Taqman PCR to a different region of the viral genome (data not shown). To more directly check for an effect of BFA on the translation of viral mRNAs, we performed an additional experiment. LR7 cells were infected at high multiplicity with the recombinant virus MHV-2aFLS, which expresses the firefly luciferase, and subsequently transfected with a synthetic mRNA encoding Renilla luciferase. This synthetic mRNA mimics viral mRNAs as it contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions identical to those found in the viral genome. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of BFA (2-6 h p.i.) after which the intracellular Renilla and firefly luciferase expression levels were determined. The results show that BFA treatment did not inhibit the synthesis of Renilla luciferase from the synthetic mRNA, while firefly luciferase expression driven by the recombinant virus was severely affected (Fig. 1C) . Renilla luciferase expression was also not affected in the absence of a viral infection (data not shown). All together, these results indicate that BFA inhibits MHV RNA replication while translation of viral mRNAs is not affected.",

As with all viruses, virtually all of the steps of their infection cycle depend on host cellular factors. As the first and most crucial step after their entry into cells, coronaviruses assemble their replication complexes (RCs) in association with characteristic, newly induced membranous structures. The cellular pathways hijacked by these plus-strand RNA viruses to create these ''factories'' have not been elucidated. Here, we study the involvement of the secretory pathway in mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication by using the drug brefeldin A (BFA), which is known to interfere with ER-Golgi membrane traffic by inhibiting the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases. Our observations show that MHV RNA replication is sensitive to BFA. In agreement herewith we demonstrate, by using various techniques, that the BFAsensitive guanidine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 and its downstream effector ARF1 are of critical importance for coronavirus replication. From our results we conclude that MHV RNA replication depends on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation. Our study provides new insights into the close connection between MHV replication and the early secretory pathway.",

This ARF1 mutant has a decreased affinity for GTP and, following GDP displacement, it remains 'nucleotidefree' for a longer period than wt ARF1 [48] . As a consequence, expression of ARF1-T31N mirrors the effects of BFA [49] . In addition to this protein, we included a constitutive-active ARF1 mutant (ARF1-Q71L), which persists in the GTP-bound state longer than wild-type ARF, resulting in a prolonged ARF1 activation. Expression of this latter mutant is known to inhibit transport at later steps in the secretory pathway, e.g. from vesicular tubular clusters (VTC) to the Golgi complex and between Golgi stacks [49] . LR7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing YFP fusions of either wild type ARF1, ARF1-T31N or ARF1-Q71L. After transfection, the cells were inoculated with an RFPexpressing MHV-A59 recombinant (MHV-RFP) that allows flow cytometric analysis of MHV replication [11] . The percentage of RFP-positive cells in the YFP-expressing population was determined relative to that of the wild type ARF1 expressing cells (Fig. 1E) . Overexpression of the wt ARF1 fusion protein itself did not significantly affect MHV infection when compared to nontransfected cells (data not shown). The results indicate that overexpression of the dominant-negative ARF1 mutant inhibited MHV infection profoundly, thereby confirming the results obtained with BFA. In contrast, expression of the constitutiveactive mutant of ARF1 did not influence MHV replication.",

The nsp8 antibody revealed the typical perinuclear staining pattern in both treated and non treated infected cells ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, a dispersed distribution of M protein was observed in BFA-treated cells reflecting the collapse of the Golgi, whereas in non-treated cells the M protein showed a clear Golgi-like staining ( Fig. 2A) .

Although some perinuclear staining of nsp8 could be detected in BFA-treated cells, the number and intensity of the nsp8 containing foci were clearly reduced when compared to non-treated cells (Fig. 2B ). We next investigated whether these nsp8 puncta represented MHV replication sites. Therefore, we studied the ability of the nsp8 foci to recruit the nucleocapsid protein N, a protein previously shown to localize to the RCs [9, 50] . Three parallel cultures of LR7 cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for a MHV N-GFP fusion protein and 24 h post transfection two of them were infected with MHV-A59. BFA (5 mg/ml) was added to one of these latter cultures directly after inoculation (t = 1 h p.i.). At 6 h p.i., the cells were fixed and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence using the anti-nsp8 antibody (Fig. 2C ). As expected, N-GFP was diffusely localized to the cytosol in non-infected cells (indicated by an arrowhead in Fig. 2C ). In contrast, when cells were infected with MHV, this fusion protein also appeared in foci that co-localized with nsp8 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C ). This co-localization was observed both in mock-and in BFA-treated cells, indicating that the nsp8 foci that had been formed in the presence of BFA, though decreased in number and intensity, correspond with the replication sites. In complete agreement with the luciferase expression data shown above, this result demonstrates that BFA inhibits, but does not completely block, the formation of RCs.",

Strikingly, the double membrane of the replication vesicles was visually more pronounced in BFA-treated cells than in untreated cells (Fig. 3B) , which might relate to the swelling of the ER observed after BFA addition.

MDCK cells stably expressing the CEACAM1a receptor (MDCK(MHVR); [57] ) were inoculated with MHV-EFLM and BFA was added either during (0-1 h p.i.) or after (1-7 h p.i.) the inoculation. The results show that MHV replication was not affected by BFA treatment of the cells during either time period (Fig. 4A) , pointing toward a possible involvement of the BFA-sensitive GBF1 protein in MHV replication.",

For each target gene, three siRNA oligos were transfected into HeLa-CEACAM1a cells. At 72 h post transfection, the cells were infected with the luciferase-expressing MHV-2aFLS. Six h later, the number of viable cells and the luciferase expression levels were determined ( Fig. S1A and S1B) as described in the Materials and Methods. In Fig. 4B the results are presented as relative luciferase expression (RII) levels, i.e. the luciferase activity expressed relative to mock-treated cells after correction for the number of viable cells. Transfection of control siRNAs targeting the housekeeping protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) did not change the RII, whereas siRNAs targeting firefly luciferase reduced the RII up to 95% (p,0.05) demonstrating the efficiency of the siRNA transfection. Importantly, down-regulation of GBF1 resulted in a drastic inhibition of RII (p,0.05) whereas siRNAs targeting BIG1 and BIG2 did not have a significant effect (Fig. 4B) . Almost identical results were obtained when the three siRNA oligos for each gene were singly transfected (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, we demonstrated that the down-regulation of the major target of GBF1, ARF1, had a similar phenotypic effect on MHV replication as seen for GBF1 (Fig. 4B) .",

The mRNA levels were not affected after transfection of non-corresponding siRNAs, demonstrating the specificity of the mRNA depletion (data not shown). Second, the functional knock-down of GBF1 and ARF1 at the protein level was demonstrated by cotransfection of plasmids encoding GBF1-YFP and ARF1-YFP together with either the GBF1-or ARF1-specific siRNAs, respectively. This approach was chosen because of the unavailability of specific anti-antibodies. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were fixed and YFP-positive cells were counted. Fig. 4C demonstrates that GBF1 and ARF1 expression are prohibited in the presence of their specific siRNAs.",

To this end, we performed a similar knock down experiment in which we transfected siRNAs targeting either ARF1 or GBF1 and subsequently infected the cells with a recombinant MHV, which expressed an additional copy of nsp2, now fused to GFP. The nsp2-GFP fusion protein co-localizes with nsp8 and provides an additional marker for the RCs (data not shown). Six hours after infection the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence with the nsp8 antibody. In mock transfected cells, many GFP and nsp8 positive foci were observed, which largely co-localized (Fig. 4E ). In agreement with the relative luciferase expression values shown in Fig. 4B , both in ARF1-and GBF1depleted cells, the number and intensity of the nsp8 positive foci was reduced, similar to what had been observed in BFA-treated cells (Fig 2B) . Apparently, the number of MHV RCs is reduced in these cells. Strikingly, however, it appeared that the nsp2-GFP expression was much more affected than that of nsp8 by the depletion of either ARF1 or GBF1, as hardly any GFP fluorescence could be detected. While nsp8 is expressed directly from the viral genome, the nsp2-GFP fusion protein is expressed from a subgenomic mRNA and hence replication and transcription is required for its expression. These results therefore indicate that not only fewer RCs are formed in the absence of either GBF1 or ARF1, but that these RCs are also impaired in their RNA synthesis.",

One of the best known functions of ARF1 involves the regulation of COPI-mediated vesicular transport. For the BFA-sensitive poliovirus, COPI has been found to localize at the replication vesicles [44] . To study whether a similar recruitment of COPI to the replication vesicles occurs during MHV replication, we determined its localization in MHV-infected cells. Thus, HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were infected with MHV-nsp2GFP. This recombinant virus allowed us to directly visualize the replication vesicles without having to perform an immunostaining with the anti-nsp8 antibodies. This was desirable as both the antibody against acCOP (two subunits of the COPI coat) and the nsp8 antibody had been raised in rabbits. At 7 h p.i. the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using the acCOP antibody. The results show that, in addition to a diffuse staining throughout the cell, COPI was primarily localized in a Golgi-like pattern (Fig. 5B) . COPI did not co-localize with the nsp2-GFP positive sites, indicating that COPI was not recruited to the replication sites of MHV.",

To investigate this, we made use of a Gaussia reporter gene, the protein product of which is secreted upon expression [62, 63] . Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding this gene under the control of a CMV promoter and subsequently infected with either MHV-A59, mock-infected, or treated with BFA. At 4.5 h p.i. the intracellular and extracellular levels of Gaussia luciferase were measured. Thus, the ratio of the luciferase activity in the cell lysate and in the culture supernatant was determined for each condition. While in mock-infected cells almost 60% of the total amount of Gaussia luciferase was found in the culture supernatant, in MHV-infected cells, the amount of secreted Gaussia luciferase was decreased about 2-fold to 30% (Fig. 6) . BFA treatment inhibited, as expected, Gaussia protein secretion almost completely. From this we conclude that although MHV RNA replication depends on GBF1mediated ARF1 activation, MHV infection does not drastically impair the secretory pathway. This result is not unexpected, as coronaviruses require a functional secretory pathway for the release of their progeny virions.",

We and others have shown that coronaviruses exploit the early secretory pathway, but the way in which they do so is not understood. In this report we have demonstrated using several different approaches that MHV requires a functional GBF1-ARF1 pathway for efficient RNA replication. First, we showed that MHV, but not Sindbis virus replication is sensitive to BFA in murine LR7 cells. Second, we observed that MHV replication is not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which contain a BFA-resistant GBF1. Third, we showed that the specific siRNA-based knockdown of the BFAsensitive GEF GBF1, but not BIG1 and BIG2, strongly affects MHV infection. Fourth, also ARF1, a downstream effector of GBF1, appeared to be required for efficient MHV replication, as shown by the inhibition of MHV-driven reporter gene expression during siRNA-mediated down regulation of ARF1 as well as during expression of an inactive ARF1 mutant.",

Though it is difficult to distinguish between these two scenarios, our results indicate the latter option to be most plausible. Although BFA reduced the number of RCs, their formation was not completely blocked as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of the RCs using the nsp8 antibody and by quantitative electron microscopy. Apparently, BFA did not prevent the formation of RCs after translation of the incoming genomic RNA. In addition, MHV replication was inhibited by BFA throughout the infection. Early in infection the inhibition was more profound than at later time points, when many transcriptionally active RCs have already been formed. Furthermore, while the inhibition of reporter gene expression in the presence of BFA, or after depletion of either GBF1 or ARF1, is in complete agreement with the reduced numbers of RCs, our results also indicate that the few RCs that are formed in the absence of GBF1 or ARF1 are less active. Therefore, we hypothesize that BFA inhibits MHV RNA replication by affecting RC maturation or functioning rather than RC formation per se (Fig. 7) .",

            "text": "Unlike for poliovirus [65] , ARF1 is hardly recruited to coronavirus RCs. We therefore hypothesize that downstream effectors of GBF1-ARF1 are involved in MHV replication. To date, more than 20 downstream effectors of ARF1 have been identified [26, 66, 67, 68] , and each one of these might thus be somehow implicated in the functioning of the MHV RCs. The most well known effector of ARF1 is COPI. For picornaviruses, BFA sensitivity was suggested to correlate with the recruitment of COPI to these sites [44] . However, no co-localization between COPI and the MHV RCs could be observed. This is in agreement with the almost complete absence of ARF1 at these sites. In addition, coronavirus RCs did not co-localize with PLD1 nor was coronavirus replication affected by inhibition of phospholipase D, a lipid-metabolizing enzyme involved in membrane dynamics and vesicular transport [59, 60] . It might be that the GBF1-ARF1 pathway simply functions to deliver lipids to the RCs. In agreement herewith, cerulenin, an inhibitor of phospholipid biosynthesis, severely inhibits MHV replication (C.A.M. de Haan, unpublished results). Nonetheless, the observed inhibition of MHV infection after BFA treatment is probably not an indirect consequence of the collapse of the Golgi complex as, unlike BFA treatment, ARF1 depletion did not affect the morphology of the Golgi complex (Fig. 4D) . Consistent herewith, another recent study showed that ARF1 depletion did not affect the Golgi morphology or protein transport [58] . Several studies have indicated that coronavirus replication and the ER are closely connected. Electron microscopical analyses of infected cells showed the partial co-localization of coronavirus replicase proteins with the soluble ER resident protein disulfide isomerise [10] , while the DMVs were often found in close proximity to the ER and occasionally in continuous association with it [10, 12] . Furthermore, when expressed in the absence of a coronavirus infection, the nsp3 and nsp4 proteins were inserted into the ER and became modified by the addition of N-linked sugars [11, 69, 70] , whereas expression of tagged MHV nsp4 in MHV-infected cells resulted in the recruitment of the protein to the replication complexes [11] . In addition, coronavirus replication was inhibited when the ER export machinery was blocked by the use of the kinase inhibitor H89 or by expression of dominantactive mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 [11] . We now show by using several approaches that MHV RNA replication also depends on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation. Apparently, an intimate association exists between the early secretory pathway and MHV replication. Interestingly, whereas H89 blocked RC formation completely [11] , this was not the case when the GBF1-mediated activation of ARF1 was impaired by BFA. Rather it appears that the RCs formed in the absence of GBF1 or ARF1 are less active, suggesting a role for these proteins in RC maturation or functioning (Fig. 7) . Clearly, further investigations are needed to unravel the precise mechanism by which the secretory pathway contributes to the biogenesis of functional coronavirus RCs and to RNA replication.",

Model of MHV RCs and their links to the early secretory pathway. Two major steps in the anterograde protein secretion route (reviewed in [81] ) are linked to MHV RC formation and/or RNA replication. First, transport of proteins out of the ER requires ER exit site formation controlled by Sar1p [82, 83, 84] . Blocking this early step by using the drug H89 [85] or by expressing of a dominant mutant of Sar1p [86] blocks MHV replication profoundly [11] . Next, ER exit sites develop into, or form de novo, vesicular-tubular clusters (VTCs) (also called ERGIC), for which GBF1 and ARF1 are required. This step, which can be blocked by BFA, by expressing a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1 or by down-regulating ARF1 using siRNAs [49] , is also involved in MHV RC formation (this manuscript). However, a fully functional secretory pathway is not essential, as a dominantactive mutant of ARF1, which blocks transport between VTCs and cis-Golgi [49] , does not impair MHV replication. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000088.g007",

Sections were stained first with 6% uranyl acetate for 30 min at RT and then with a lead-citrate solution (80 mM lead nitrate, 120 mM sodium citrate, pH 12) for 2 min before being viewed. Analysis of EM sections was performed by using a Jeol1010 electron microscope.",
