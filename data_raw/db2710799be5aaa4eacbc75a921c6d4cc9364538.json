However, there are limited studies of MERS-CoV infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dromedaries. We expanded our surveillance among camels in Egypt, Tunisia, and Senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camels. A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90% PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6%) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8%) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9%) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to \u22651:320. We detected MERS-CoV RNA in swabs from three sheep (1.2%) of 254 and five goats (4.1%) of 121 from Egypt and Senegal, as well as one cow (1.9%) of 53 and three donkeys (7.1%) of 42 from Egypt. Partial sequences of the RT-PCR amplicons confirmed specificity of the results. This study showed that domestic livestock in contact with MERS-CoV infected camels may be at risk of infection. We recommend expanding current MERS-CoV surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dromedary camels. The segregation of camels from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered.",

These animals were sero-negative, as expected, as serological responses only appear 2-3 weeks after infection by which time virus RNA will usually be undetectable. The rtRT-PCR positive animals were asymptomatic as is the case for camels infected with MERS-CoV. The identity of the host species of the swabs positive for virus RNA was additionally confirmed by DNA barcoding in order to assure that no mix up with camel swabs had occurred during sampling or sample handling. Finding MERS-CoV RNA in upper respiratory tract swabs may simply represent exposure and environmental contamination from infected camels or environments contaminated with camel excretions rather than convincing evidence of active infection. In contrast, evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody implies evidence of active infection by MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. Attempts to culture the viruses detected in the study or to obtain full-genome sequences were not successful hence limiting our ability to further verify the findings of this study. It is important to note that this evidence comes from countries where human infection with MERS-CoV was never reported locally and that evidence of MERS-CoV infection in non-camelid mammals was never reported in countries where human infections are common.",

Experimental inoculation of sheep and horses with the first prototype isolate of MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) showed no infection despite that the same virus was able to infect pigs and llamas [15, 16] . This may be due to the absence of the A431T mutation in the virus used in those studies. This mutation may be a key to enabling MERS-CoV infection in non-camelid domestic species and this requires further study. Future experimental infections of livestock need to be conducted also using MERS-CoV of African origin.",

Our data does not prove MERS-CoV can be sustained by transmission within these other livestock species in the absence of camels as the primary source of infection. However, if other domestic livestock such as sheep may be infected by MERS-CoV, they may also be a risk factor for human infection. Our findings highlight the need for further field studies of domestic livestock, especially those that are in close contact with dromedary camels and also the need for experimental studies infecting livestock such as sheep using MERS-CoV isolates from Africa. Our findings may raise the need to segregate other livestock from dromedary camels in farms and live animal markets.",

In Tunisia, 342 sera and 346 nasal swabs were obtained from 321 adult and 25 juvenile cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, mules, and horses in contact with camels at a major livestock market in Southern Tunisia during December and January of 2016 and 2017. In Senegal, 72 sera and 72 nasal swabs were collected from 61 adult and 11 juvenile sheep and goats in contact with pastoral camels in the Northwest of the country during August 2017. Nasal swabs were screened by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rtRT-PCR) targeting upstream of E gene of MERS-CoV [17] . Positive samples were confirmed using first the Open Reading Frame (ORF) 1a. When ORF1a testing was negative, the N genebased PCR assay was then performed as recommended by the WHO [18]. Samples not confirmed by ORF1a or N were tested by an in-house RT-PCR for the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) (see below) and PCR products to confirm specificity of the RT-PCR assay.",
