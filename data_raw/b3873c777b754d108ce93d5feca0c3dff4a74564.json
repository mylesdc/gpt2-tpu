To improve measles control strategy, the epidemic trend and population immunity of measles were investigated in 1951-2011 in Beijing. Methods: The changing trend of measles since 1951 was described based on measles surveillance data from Beijing Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The measles vaccination coverage and antibody level were assessed by routinely reported measles vaccination data and twenty-one sero-epidemiological surveys. Results: The incidence of measles has decreased significantly from 593.5/100,000 in 1951 (peaked at 2721.0/100,000 in 1955), to 0.5/100,000 in 2011 due to increasing vaccination coverage of 95%-99%. Incidence rebounded from 6.6/ 100,000 to 24.5/100,000 since 2005 and decreased after measles vaccine (MV) supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2010. Measles antibody positive rate was 85%-95% in most of years since 1981. High-risk districts were spotted in Chaoyang, Fengtai and Changping districts in recent 15 years. Age-specific incidence and proportion of measles varied over time. The most affected population were younger children of 1-4 years before 1978, older children of 5-14 years in 1978-1996, infant of <1 years and adults of \u226515 years in period of aim to measles elimination. Conclusion: Strategies at different stages had a prevailing effect on the epidemic dynamics of measles in recent 60 years in Beijing. It will be essential to validate reported vaccination coverage, improve vaccination coverage in adults and strengthen measles surveillance in the anticipated elimination campaign for measles.",

The 1978 establishment of the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) resulted in a standard routine immunization schedule including MV administered as 1 dose to infants aged 8 months. In 1986, a 2dose schedule using lyophilized MV at 8 months and 7 years of age was implemented [5] . The next step was a 1997 national plan of action for accelerated measles control that called for 90% MV coverage, measles surveillance and catch-up campaigns for provinces. In 2005, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Regional Committee for the Western Pacific Region set a target date of 2012 for measles elimination in the region including China [6, 7] . Since 2005, the age of administration of the second dose was lowered from 7 years to 1.5 years. The 2006-2012 national action plan to eliminate measles claimed comprehensive measures including 95% MV coverage of 2 doses, measles surveillance, regional and national supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), vaccination certificate of children at admission to child care setting and school [8, 9] . China is a developing country with vast territory of 9.6 million square kilometers and large population of 1. 37 billion, which has 23 provinces, 4 municipalities, 5 autonomous regions and 2 special administrative regions with different levels of economic and social development, predicting different challenges in reaching measles elimination. Hence, strategies of prevention and control measles were slightly different among different provinces.",

With the improvement of surveillance and moving towards measles elimination, the demands of measles case classification have changed during different phases. Before period of planned vaccination in 1978, almost all measles were clinical diagnosed case due to lack of routine and convenient laboratory test method. Since 1980, laboratory test method of measles antibody was used in case diagnosis. The national serological surveillance laboratory network was established in 2001 to provide serological confirmation of measles infection and to support measles surveillance. All cases included in this analysis were confirmed cases including laboratory or clinical confirmed and epidemiological related cases.

Since this period, agespecific incidence showed a change, three peaks of higher incidence were found in infants of <1 years, children of 5-7 years and adults of 20-30 years. In 2000-2004, incidence increased in all age groups, ranging from 3.6/ 100,000 to 61.5/100,000 for children aged \u226414 years and 1.1/100,000 to 11.9/100,000 for adults aged \u226515 years, with two crest in infants of <1 years and adults of 20-30 years. In 2005-2010, age-specific incidence increased to 5.1/100,000-82.9/100,.000 for children aged \u226414 years and 2.3/100,000-28.0/100,000 for adults aged \u226515 years, with highest 373.0/100,000 in infants aged <1 years. After MV SIA in 2010, incidence declined greatly to 0-1.2/100,000 for \u22652 years age group, while incidence was 29.9/100,000 for <1 years age group and 5.8/100,000 for 1-2 years age group ( Figure 3 ). Age-proportion distribution of measles cases varied over time. From 1957 to 1962, the most affected age groups were children of 1-4 years old, with proportion of 91.0%. The proportion of 5-9 years was 7.0%. From 1973 to 1977, the proportion of measles cases decreased to 59.1% in children of 1-4 years, but increased to 40.7% in children of 5-9 years. From 1978 to 1984, the proportion of 1-4 years and 5-9 years age groups were continually decreased to 23.2% and 33.0%, respectively. The affected age groups expand to 10-14 years age group with 26.4% and \u226515 years with 12.0%. In 1987-1996, the proportion of 1-14 years age group decreased to 5.6%-18.0%, while the proportion of adults of \u226515 years increased to 61.4%. In 2000-2004, proportion for infants of <1 years and children of 1-4 years increased to 11.8% and 15.6%, gradually. Adults of \u226515 years accounted for 56.5%. In 2005-2011, proportion of infants aged <1 years continually increased to 23.5%. Adults aged \u226515 years accounted for 52.9% (Figure 3 ).",

Consistent with observations from other countries, epidemic cycles of measles occurred every 2-3 years in Beijing before measles vaccination, when measles virus was in a natural infectious state. Virtually everyone experienced measles illness during the childhood [16] . 91% of individuals were infected by the age of 1-4 years. After implementation of measles vaccination, especially program immunization with two doses at age of 8 months and 1.5 years in 1978, measles incidence drop dramatically [17, 18] , but resurgences occurred in 1982 and again in 1986. These resurgences may result from low effectiveness of liquid MV from Jing 55 strains [19] and an accumulation of susceptible to a critical threshold level. This highlighted that situation of lower immunogenicity and administration of two doses was inadequate for the interruption of measles transmission. Jing 55 MV strains were replaced by Hu 191 strains, which had good immunogenicity and long-term persistence [20] and the third dose was introduced since 1982. Furthermore in 1987, liquid MV was replaced by lyophilized vaccine to improve vaccine stability and immunogenicity. Increasing vaccination coverage led to declining incidence of measles to historical lowest level in 1995 and longer inter-epidemic periods of 3-4 years. The incidence of measles appeared rise from 2005 due to enhancement of measles surveillance susceptibility through directly reporting suspected measles cases by network [21] . The 2010 national MV SIAs targeting children aged 8 months to 14 years was successful in largely interrupting measles virus transmission, resulting in almost historical lowest level of measles incidence in 2011.",

            "text": "With the increasing vaccination coverage in Beijing, the age distribution of cases shifted from younger children of 1-4 years to older children of 5-14 years and adults of 15-30 years; The upward shift in the age of measles cases to older age groups with increasing MV coverage was well documented in other settings [22] [23] [24] [25] . Toward the end of endemic measles virus transmission in the Americas, outbreaks in some regions included cases among older children and young adults [26, 27] . In Beijing, young adults, especially migrant workers from other province living in the poor and crowd environment, clearly played a large role in the initial spread of measles epidemic. China could be divided into 3 groups: eastern, central and western provinces or regions, according to economic and social development. Migrants leaved their hometown in western and central provinces including to Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, et al. and swarmed to the eastern and more developed provinces including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, et al. in recent two decades. The national measles surveillance indicated that the average reported measles incidence decreased more in the Western (from 131.2/100,000 to 105.8/100,000) than in the Central provinces (from 57.6/100,000 to 55.5/100,000) from 1990-1999 to 2000-2009. In contrast, incidence in the eastern provinces increased from a lower level of 38.8/100,000 in 1990-1999 to 65.0/100,000 in 2000-2009. Persons in this age group likely remained susceptible to measles because most were born during the period of MV introduction into the routine immunization program and scaling up of coverage [28] . These young adults born during 1970s-1990s were more likely escaped from both natural measles infection and measles vaccination, when measles incidence declined and vaccine coverage was not high during initial period of measles vaccination, especially in other province with lower development of immunization service [29] . decreased from 17.8% in 2005 to 9.1% in 2010 [28] . However, these populations had a strong mobility. Large-scale immunization may not interrupt measles virus transmission. For infants, the age of infection decreased slightly and the proportion of measles case increased gradually with higher vaccination coverage from 1978 in Beijing. Infants born to immune mothers received maternal antibodies transferred during the perinatal period and remained protected, on average, until approximately 4-6 months of age [30] . However, transferred maternal antibodies that were vaccine-induced rather than naturally acquired following measles infection generally existed at lower geometric mean titers in the mother and infant and waned much earlier, leaving the infant unprotected as early as 1 month of age [31, 32] . In addition, the relatively high incidence among infants and young adults suggested that many young mothers may never have been vaccinated or acquired natural immunity, leaving their newborn children at increased risk from birth because they lacked protective maternal antibody against measles. The outcome of Beijing and other Western Pacific Region countries and areas will help determine whether ensuring high population immunity among adults is necessary to achieve measles elimination in other regions. Measles incidence has varied widely by district. From 1998 to 2011, the incidence was higher in Chaoyang, Changping and Fengtai districts. Over 50% of cases were reported from these three districts. The flow of migrant workers from other provinces caused the spread of the disease. These three districts are the suburb in Beijing, in which population increase dramatically with development of economics [33] . The density of the population was higher compared with other districts [34] . Large population size and high population density negatively impact the progress of measles elimination [35] . Increasing numbers of migrant workers could be major reason for the higher incidence of measles.",

            "text": "To interrupt endemic transmission of measles virus, mathematical models indicate that \u226593%-95% population immunity is needed [36] . In the region of the Americas, measles was declared eliminated in 2002 after the successful implementation of a strategy that included achieving and sustaining a very high coverage (\u226595%) of children [37] . Application of similar strategies in 7 southern African countries led to similar results [38] . In Beijing, the coverage of first dose MV increased steadily and reached to almost 100% from 1990. However, a gap remained between the second dose coverage and the 95% goal in 2002-2004 while SARS happened in China. The fact that the resurgence of measles incidence was found in 2005, especially for age of 1-6 years also indicated that routine coverage was insufficient to interrupt measles transmission in this age group. In addition, MV coverage rates in migrant children were only 76.6%-81.6% through investigation in 1998-2003, which significantly lower than that in local children [39] [40] [41] . SIAs among migrant children under 7 years old was implemented since 2000 in Beijing. The immunization management for migrant children after SIAs was improved greatly. However, the migrant children who lived in populous townships or had shorter residence time were still the emphasis [42] [43] [44] . Strong commitment and effort were urgently needed to maintain 95% of 2 doses routine coverage and measure coverage accurately.",
