They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.",

We found that parallel mutations-that are indicative of selection-were significantly more likely to occur within viral lineages from the same host, and between viruses evolved in closely related species.

RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1] [2] [3] [4] , with HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species [5] [6] [7] . Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9] . These adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11] . For example, in the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13] . Likewise, a switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15] .",

For example, in the jump of HIV-1 from chimps to humans, codon 30 of the gag gene has undergone a change that increases virus replication in humans, and this has occurred independently in all three HIV-1 lineages [5, 16] . Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus following its jump from palm civets into humans [17] . Similar patterns have been seen in experimental evolution studies, where parallel genetic changes occur repeatedly when replicate viral lineages adapt to a new host species in the lab. For example, when Vesicular Stomatitis Virus was passaged in human or dog cells, the virus evolved parallel mutations when evolved on the same cell type [18] . Likewise, a study passaging Tobacco Etch Potyvirus on four plant species found parallel mutations occurred only when the virus infected the same host species [19] . These parallel mutations provide compelling evidence that these genetic changes are adaptive, with the same mutations evolving independently in response to natural selection [20] . These studies have only used a limited number of hosts, and so do not provide information on how viral evolution occurs across a wide phylogenetic breadth of host species.",

We then sequenced the genomes of the evolved viral lineages and tested whether the same genetic changes arose when the virus was evolved in closely related host species.",

When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. Such repeatable parallel genetic changes to the same host environment are compelling evidence that these changes are adaptive [20] . We then examined whether these same genetic changes might occur in closely related host species, as these are likely to present a similar environment for the virus. We found that viruses evolved in closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viruses that evolved in more distantly related species. Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. This finding of parallel genetic changes in closely related host species suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species.",

This pattern is seen in nature, where host shifts tend to occur most frequently between closely related hosts, and in laboratory cross-infection studies, where viruses tend to replicate more rapidly when the new host is related to the pathogens natural host [2, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . For example, in a large cross-infection experiment involving Drosophila sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae) isolated from different species of Drosophila, the viruses tended to replicate most efficiently in species closely related to their natural hosts [34] . This suggests that these viruses had acquired adaptations to their host species that benefitted them when they infected closely related species. Our results demonstrate that this pattern is apparent at the level of specific nucleotides, and can arise very shortly after a host shift. While the susceptibility of a novel host is correlated to its relatedness to the pathogens' original host, it is also common to find exceptions to this pattern. This is seen both in nature when pathogens shift between very distant hosts [45, 46] , and in laboratory cross-infection experiments [33, 34] . This pattern is also seen in our data where we also observe parallel genetic changes occurring between more distantly related hosts. For example, a mutation at position 8072 was not only near fixation in most of the lineages infecting two closely related species, but also occurred at a high frequency in replicate lineages in a phylogenetically distant host (Fig 1) .",

To minimise the amount of genetic variation in the DCV isolate we used to initiate the experimental evolution study, we aimed to isolate single infectious clones of DCV using a serial dilution procedure. DCV was produced in Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (DL2) cells [52] as described in [53] . Cells were cultured at 25\u02daC in Schneider's Drosophila Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (all Invitrogen, UK). The DCV strain used was isolated from D. melanogaster collected in Charolles, France [54] . DL2 cells were seeded into two 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 10 4 cells in 100 \u03bcl of media per well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates by incubating at 25\u02daC for five hours or over-night. Serial 1:1 dilutions of DCV were made in complete Schneider's media, giving a range of final dilutions from 1:10 8 -1:4x10 14 . 100 \u03bcl of these dilutions were then added to the cells and incubated for 7 days, 8 replicates were made for each DCV dilution. Each well was then examined for DCV infection of the DL2 cells, and a well was scored as positive for DCV infection if clear cytopathic effects were present in the majority of the cells. The media was taken from the wells with the greatest dilution factor that were scored as infected with DCV and stored at -80\u02daC. This processes was then repeated using the DCV samples from the first dilution series. One clone, B6A, was selected for amplification and grown in cell culture as described above. Media containing DCV was removed and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes at 4\u02daC to pellet any remaining cell debris, before being aliquoted and stored at -80\u02daC. The Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of the DCV was 6.32 x 10 9 infectious particles per ml using the Reed-Muench endpoint method [55] .",

For the first passage this was the cloned DCV isolate in cell culture supernatant (described above), and then subsequently was the virus extracted from the previous passage (described below). The needle was pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of flies, towards the midcoxa. Each replicate was infected using a new needle and strict general cleaning procedures were used to minimise any risk of cross-contamination between replicates. Species were collected and inoculated in a randomised order each passage. Flies were then placed into vials of cornmeal medium and kept at 22\u02daC and 70% relative humidity. Flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 3 days post-infection, homogenised in Ringer's solution (2.5\u03bcl per fly) and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 mins at 4\u02daC. The resulting supernatant was removed and frozen at -80\u02daC to be used for infecting flies in the subsequent passage. The remaining homogenate was preserved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80\u02daC for RNA extraction. The 3 day viral incubation period was chosen based on time course and pilot data showing that viral load reaches a maximum at approximately 3 days post-infection. This process was repeated for 10 passages for all species, except D. montana where only 8 passages were carried out due to the fly stocks failing to reproduce. Each lineage was injected into a mean of 11 flies at each passage (range 4-18). Experimental evolution studies in different tissue types have seen clear signals of adaptation in 100 virus generations [18] . Based on log 2 change in RNA viral load we estimate that we have passaged DCV for approximately 100-200 generations.",

We lacked the statistical power to identify the specific SNPs that are causing the signature of parallel evolution in Fig 3 (false discovery rate >0.49 for all SNPs). Two of the most striking examples of parallel evolution in related species are in Scaptodrosophila pattersoni and S. lebanonensis, which show two high frequency parallel mutations. These are a synonymous mutation in the 2C replicase protein at position 1901 and a triallelic non-synonymous mutation in a viral capsid protein at position 8072. However, the wider pattern of parallel evolution is not driven by these two examples, as the results remained significant after",
