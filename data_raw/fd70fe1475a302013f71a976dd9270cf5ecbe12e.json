In brief, V1V2-IgG at a concentration of 0, 10 and 20 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, was preincubated with the HIV-1-infected cells H9\u2162B at 4\u00b0C for 60 min, before addition of PG9 at 10 \u03bcg/mL, followed by detection of the PG9-binding cells using the fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, V1V2-IgG purified from the sera of pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 group exhibited the highest inhibition on PG9 binding to the HIV-1-infected cells, followed by that from the pEnv+gp120 and pEnv+gp70-V1V2 groups and then from the gp120 and gp70-V1V2 groups. This result is consistent with that from the V1V2-IgG-binding experiment ( Figure 1D ), confirming that the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 vaccine regimen can induce high level of IgG antibodies binding to V1V2 region of the HIV-1 Env.",

Meanwhile, the result indicates that the gp120 boost is also essential to induce functional V1V2-IgG that can bind to the native conformational epitopes in the V1V2 region of Env on the surface of HIV-1-infected cells since V1V2-IgG from the pEnv+gp70-V1V2 group is less effective in binding to the HIV-1-infected cells than that from pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2. Prime and boosts with gp70-V1V2 only could not induce functional V1V2-IgG response ( Figure 1D ). It is possible that the conformation of the V1V2 region in gp120 may be more like to the native conformation of V1V2 region in the Env of virions or HIV-1-infected cells than that of the V1V2 region in gp70-V1V2. Therefore, the V1V2 in gp120 may bind to intermediate B-cell receptor more easily than that in gp70-V1V2. However, the V1V2 region in gp70-V1V2 may be more accessible to B-cell receptor trained by the V1V2 region in gp120. This may explain why the pEnv prime/ gp120 boost/gp70-V1V2 boost vaccine regimen elicits more effective V1V2-IgG response than the pEnv prime/gp70-V1V2 boost and gp70-V1V2 prime/gp70-V1V2 boost vaccine regimens. These results suggest that gp70-V1V2 and pEnv+gp70-V1V2 immune regimens induce higher levels of antibodies binding to gp70-V1V2 protein, while pEnv+gp70-V1V2 immune regimen elicits higher level of antibodies binding to the native conformation of V1V2 region in the HIV-1 Env. Therefore, the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 regimen should be selected for further study.",

As shown in Figure 1E , Env-IgA from the gp120 prime/gp120 boost group and that from the gp70-V1V2 prime/gp70-V1V2 boost group displayed the highest and lowest levels of binding to HIV-1infected cells, respectively. This result suggests that the epitopes that elicit Env-IgA are located in gp120 outside the V1V2 region. Interestingly, the Env-IgA from the pEnv prime/gp120 boost/gp70-V1V2 boost group exhibited significantly lower level of binding to HIV-1-infected cells than that from the pEnv prime/gp120 boost group (Po0.05), suggesting that gp70-V1V2 in the vaccine regimen may have a suppressive effect on Env-or gp120-induced Env-IgA response.",

After binding to the V1V2 region, V1V2-IgG, via its Fc fragment, then binds and activates the Fc receptor Fc\u03b3RIIIa (CD16) on NK cells, which results in killing HIV-1-infected cells. Therefore, we first assessed the ability of HIV-1-infected cell binding V1V2-IgG to activate Fc\u03b3RIIIa with an Fc\u03b3RIIIa stimulation assay, using an ADCC Reporter Bioassay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). HIV-1-infected cells were incubated with V1V2-IgG before co-culture with Jurkat NFAT-lucFc\u03b3RIIIa cells expressing an NFAT-luciferase reporter, which can be activated by Fc\u03b3RIIIa stimulation. 9 As shown in Figure 1F , the HIV-1-infected cell-binding V1V2-IgG from the pEnv +gp120 group could effectively activate Fc\u03b3RIIIa on Jurkat NFAT-luc +Fc\u03b3RIIIa cells, compared with that from the PBS group, while the V1V2-IgG from the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 group exhibited a significantly higher level of Fc\u03b3RIIIa activation than that from the pEnv+gp120 group (Po0.05). Using the CytoTox-ONE Homogeneous Membrane Integrity Assay (Promega), we then further tested the activity of NK cells via ADCC effect to kill the V1V2-IgG-bound HIV-infected cells. 11 HIV-1-infected cells were incubated with V1V2-IgG before co-culture with rabbit peripheral blood mononuclear cells containing NK cells. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase released from the HIV-1-infected cells killed by NK cells was measured using the same assay. 11 Consistent with the result from the Fc\u03b3RIIIa stimulation assay (Figure 1F ), the ADCC mediated by NK cells and the V1V2-IgG from the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 group exhibited significantly stronger killing of the HIV-1-infected cells than that from the pEnv+gp120 group (Po0.05; Figure 1G ). These results suggest that the additional gp70-V1V2 boost after the pEnv prime/gp120 boost is essential to enhance V1V2-IgG-mediated ADCC. Meanwhile, we performed an experiment to detect V1V2-IgG-mediated ADCC effect on target cells infected by different HIV-1 strains, including the laboratory-adapted strain Bal and the clinical strain 11244 (HIV-1 KNH1088). As shown in Figure 1H and 1I, V1V2-IgG induced by pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 vaccine regimen mediated similar high level of ADCC effect to kill the cells infected by the HIV-1 Bal or 11244 strain, respectively, suggesting that V1V2-IgG could mediate a broad spectrum of ADCC effect against cells infected by laboratory-adapted or clinically isolated HIV-1 stains.",

However, we also applied the immunofocusing strategy by adding final boosts with gp70-V1V2, consisting of V1V2 region in gp120, after pEnv prime/gp120 boosts, in anticipation of enhancing V1V2-IgG and ADCC responses, as well as reducing Env-IgA response. Indeed, we found that the levels of V1V2-IgG response and ADCC effect in the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 group were significantly higher compared with pEnv+gp120, while the level of Env-IgA response in the pEnv+gp120+gp70-V1V2 group was significantly lower than that in the pEnv+gp120 group. The immunofocusing strategy may promote the production of V1V2-IgG that can recognize and bind to V1V2 region with native conformation in the HIV-1 Env on HIV-1-infected cells, thus mediating the ADCC effect to kill these infected cells.These results suggest that the immunofocusing strategy is very helpful for designing a vaccine regimen by maintaining the fragment(s) in the immunogen containing the critical epitope(s) that elicit(s) protective immune responses, while excluding the fragment(s) containing the epitope(s) that induce(s) non-protective or harmful immune response but without sacrificing domain integrity and stability. Therefore, we prospect that this immunofocusing strategy may also be used to improve the RV144 HIV vaccine regimen, that is, addition of a final boost with gp70-V1V2 or similar recombinant protein containing V1V2 region in gp120, and that this improved RV144 HIV vaccine regimen may induce enhanced protective immune responses and reduced harmful immune response in the volunteers participating in the South Africa HVTN 702 clinical trials, which is based on the RV144 vaccine regimen. 4 ",
