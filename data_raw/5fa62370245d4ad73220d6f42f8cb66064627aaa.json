            "text": "Dengue virus causes ,50-100 million infections per year and thus is considered one of the most aggressive arthropodborne human pathogen worldwide. During its replication, dengue virus induces dramatic alterations in the intracellular membranes of infected cells. This phenomenon is observed both in human and vector-derived cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells, we show that this membrane remodeling is directly linked to a unique lipid repertoire induced by dengue virus infection. Specifically, 15% of the metabolites detected were significantly different between DENV infected and uninfected cells while 85% of the metabolites detected were significantly different in isolated replication complex membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular lipid redistribution induced by the inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, is sufficient for cell survival but is inhibitory to dengue virus replication. Lipids that have the capacity to destabilize and change the curvature of membranes as well as lipids that change the permeability of membranes are enriched in dengue virus infected cells. Several sphingolipids and other bioactive signaling molecules that are involved in controlling membrane fusion, fission, and trafficking as well as molecules that influence cytoskeletal reorganization are also up regulated during dengue infection. These observations shed light on the emerging role of lipids in shaping the membrane and protein environments during viral infections and suggest membraneorganizing principles that may influence virus-induced intracellular membrane architecture.",

The ability to synthesize lipids predisposes an organism to function as a host to parasites that have lost or lack this trait [1] . Viruses as obligate parasites rely exclusively on the host to fulfill their membrane and lipid requirements. This is especially true for enveloped viruses since they utilize host-derived lipid membranes to facilitate release from infected cells by budding as well as to enter cells through membrane fusion. Lipids also form an integral structural component of the virus particle.",

Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses induce extensive ultrastructural changes in infected cells. Host-derived membranes are rearranged to provide extensive platforms that help to assemble arrays of replication factories [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Some of these factories are housed in specialized membrane compartments that assist in evading host antiviral defense mechanisms [2] [3] [4] 7] . These compartments also function to increase the local concentration of molecules necessary for efficient viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Recent advances in electron tomography techniques have been instrumental in providing a three-dimensional perspective of these virus-induced membranes [2] [3] [4] 7] . However, the metabolic cost to the host or vector and the contribution of lipid biosynthesis and trafficking to the formation of these replication factories is yet in its early stages of investigation [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Currently 50-100 million cases of dengue fever are estimated annually [14] . Since DENV replicates within the mosquito vector as well as the human host, the spread of the virus can be greatly reduced by controlling the vector. Much effort has been placed in understanding the dynamics of virus transmission and replication in the mosquito vector, including identification of host proteins in the midgut and salivary glands that are regulated by DENV infection [15] [16] [17] . Less is known about the global impact of DENV on host metabolic pathways.",

Identifying these lipid changes that occur during infection is a necessary first step to discovering how DENV and its constituent proteins modify the lipid metabolism of cells. The reason(s) for such modifications has yet to be described, but can be pursued with a knowledge of which lipid changes occur.

In this study, using an inhibitor of FAS, C75, we determined that this requirement for fatty acid biosynthesis was conserved between the host and its vector during DENV infection. In the presence of C75 DENV replication was significantly reduced in C6/36 mosquito cells indicating that fatty acid biosynthesis is important for virus viability ( Figure 1A ). Furthermore, a time course of addition of C75 ( Figure 1B ) indicated that while pre-treatment or treatment of cells with C75 during viral adsorption reduced virus replication by ,10-100 fold, the most significant effect occurred upon addition of the drug at 4 and 8 hr post-infection (,1000 fold). This suggested that a post-entry step was affected by the inhibition of FAS. A comparison of virus released into the supernatant to intracellular virus indicated that an accumulation of intracellular virus was not occurring in the C75 treated cells (data not shown). Thus, the block in replication was not at the level of virus assembly or release.",

Therefore, to investigate whether the intracellular lipid composition was altered during DENV infection, we carried out LC-MS-based analyses of the global lipidome of mosquito cells infected with DENV. To differentiate between changes to the lipid profile that occurred upon exposure to infectious virus versus that induced by virus entry alone, we included UV-inactivated DENV (UV-DENV) in the studies. This inactivated virus is only capable of binding, entry and initial rounds of viral RNA translation but does not have the ability to replicate its genome. Figure 2 shows a principle component analysis (PCA) plot of the overall lipid abundance in C6/36 mosquito cells infected with either DENV or UV-DENV at 36 and 60 hr post-infection. The 36 hr time point was chosen to represent a peak in viral replication while the 60 hr time point represents late stages of replication as well as increased cellular stress. Our previous analysis of earlier time points (ie. 24 hr post-infection) indicated that concurrent with increasing RNA synthesis activity and virus release, there were substantial changes in the lipidome of infected cells. Some of these changes were greater (higher fold changes) than those observed at the 36 hr time point. However, the overall intensities of the expressed lipids was lower contributing to a low signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, the number of species expressed at significant levels (p,0.05) were limited. Therefore, we chose to pursue the later time points. Under conditions that ensured that all cells were infected (multiplicity of infection of 20), optimal viral RNA synthesis occurred between 24-36 hr post infection (data not shown). A total of 7217 features observed in the LC-MS analyses were included in the PCA analyses. The plot shows specific segregation of lipid profiles between DENV and UV-DENV exposed cells compared to uninfected cells (mock). A temporal regulation of the lipid profile was also observed. However, this is more discernible upon analysis of individual lipid species (Figure 3 ) rather than in the PCA analysis. Overall, in this whole cell analysis",

It causes 50-100 million infections per year but there is no vaccine or antiviral that is currently effective against the disease. The virus is spread by Aedes aegyptii and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and viral replication within the mosquito vector is required for transmission to a new human host. During this replication cycle, the virus causes significant changes to the membrane organization of infected cells. These virus-induced membrane alterations help to assemble arrays of viral replication factories and aid the virus to evade host antiviral defense mechanisms. Previously, much effort has been placed in trying to identify viral and cellular protein effectors that aid virus replication. In this study we have explored the role of lipids in the formation of these extensive membrane platforms in mosquito cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry we have profiled the lipid composition of dengue virus infected mosquito cells and compared it to uninfected cells. Through this we have identified several lipid classes that are differentially regulated during dengue virus replication. Using inhibitors of lipid biosynthesis we have also identified a lipid repertoire that is inhibitory to viral replication. Knowledge of how dengue virus utilizes cellular lipids and downstream signaling pathways to facilitate its replication will provide novel targets that could be utilized for developing effective antivirals. This study is also a forerunner for future comparative analyses of the human host and vector membrane environments required for viral replication. 15% of the metabolites identified were significantly (Anova p,0.05) different between virus infected cells and the mock control.",

This distribution is similar to the membrane lipid composition of eukaryotic cells where the most abundant phospholipid is PC [21] . It is also consistent with the membrane lipid composition of the Diptera species where PE is a predominant PL [22] . CER-PE, which is preferentially expressed in insect cells, is also observed here [23] [24] . Several of these lipids are differentially regulated upon exposure of cells to DENV or UV-DENV ( Figure 3 ). It was noticeable however, that several negatively charged lipid classes such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and Cardiolipin, were absent from this list. These lipids have previously been reported to account for 6-13% of the lipidome of mosquito cells [25, 26] .

Essentially, we monitored the production of BODIPY-LPC (resulting from PLA 2 mediated metabolism of PC) during a time course of DENV infection ( Figure S1 ) (method from [31] ). The assay indicated that following 24 hr of infection and longer, PLA 2 activity was elevated in DENV-infected cells compared to the controls, with the highest activity occurring at 48 and 72 hr postinfection.

Although originally known as vital components of barrier membranes, sphingolipids are also potent bioactive molecules that regulate cell death, growth, differentiation and intracellular trafficking [32] [33] . The primary sphingolipids regulated during DENV infection were sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide (CER). In DENV infected cells, SM was up regulated by ,2-fold compared to the controls (UV-DENV and mock) and remained elevated at both 36 hr and 60 hr time points ( Figure 3A and B). Furthermore, this temporal expression varied depending on the specific molecular species being expressed ( Figure 3E and Table S1 ). UV-DENV exposed cells showed similar levels of SM compared to the mock at the 36 hr time point, but these levels decreased at the later time point. Interestingly, an analog of SM known as ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CER-PE), was preferentially expressed (up regulated by ,2 fold) in UV-DENV exposed cells at the 36 hr time point (compared to DENV and mock) ( Figure 3G ). However, this expression level dropped below the mock at the later time point. In comparison, DENV infected cells showed very low expression of this lipid at the early time point (,0.7 fold compared to mock) and its expression was undetectable at the later time point ( Figure 3A and B). This lipid is expressed more abundantly in insect cells rather than in mammalian cells [23] [24] .",

Since SM was also up regulated similarly in DENV infected cells, the rise in CER is possibly the result of de novo synthesis rather than SM degradation. UV-DENV-exposed cells showed undetectable CER levels at 36 hr, while at 60 hr the expression was (,2 fold) above the mock control. Since there was a concurrent decrease in SM in UV-DENV exposed cells at 60 hr, the increased levels of CER in this case could be due to the degradation of SM resulting from increased cellular stress (resulting from incubation of the cells for 60 hr). Similar to other lipid species, CER also showed temporal regulation depending on the molecular species expressed ( Figure 3F ).",

Therefore, the labeled lipids (in CE) represent not only phospholipids in membranes, but also cholesterol and triglycerides that form lipid droplets [36] . In this study, lipidomic analyses were carried out on both the 16K and CE subcellular fractions isolated from the 36 hr time point from DENV infected cells, UV-DENV exposed cells and the mock control. The primary lipids observed in the CE fraction were sphingolipids. Cholesterol and triglycerides were not successfully separated using our mass spectrometry analyses and very few phospholipids were observed to be statistically significant (p,0.05) in virus infected cells over the mock control (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our primary lipidomic analysis on lipids extracted from the 16K pellet at the 36 hr time point. Similar to the whole cell analysis, DENV infected cells displayed a unique expression profile compared to UV-DENV and mock infected cells ( Figure S2 ). Over 85% of the metabolites detected were significantly regulated in virus-infected cells compared to the controls. Analysis of the membrane fraction also highlighted several lipid species not detected in our whole cell analysis.

To determine the basis for this exclusion of virus replication, we profiled the lipidome of cells treated with 25 mM C75. Membrane fractions isolated from DENV infected and mock control cells in the presence or absence of C75 were profiled.

Since C75 disrupts the formation of lipids down stream of FAS, several fatty acids (stearic and palmitic acid) were down regulated in the drug treated cells. An enrichment of these fatty acids was observed in the untreated cells upon comparison with C75 treated cells ( Figure 7C ). In contrast, as observed in the previous comparison of DENV infected cells to uninfected cells ( Figure 5 ), oleic acid was down-regulated in untreated DENV infected cells and therefore, showed enrichment in C75 treated cells.

Enrichment of these lipids was observed in untreated DENV infected cells compared to C75 treated cells ( Figure 7D ). In addition to the phospholipids, de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was also disrupted by C75.

In the lipidomic analyses, the up regulation of intermediates such as N-palmitoylesphingosine suggests sphingolipid biosynthesis is activated during DENV infection. Specifically, SM and CER are enriched in DENV infected cells. Alternately, the up regulation in CER (and DG) during infection could result from the degradation of SM through the activity of sphingomyelinases (Smase). The resulting CER and DG could be redirected into several signaling pathways or be utilized for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. The glycopshingolipids, GlcCER and GalCER are down regulated during DENV infection, which suggest that they are catabolized to produce CER. 5. Lipidomic analyses also suggest the up regulation of triacylglycerol catabolism (Lipolysis) in DENV infected cells. This pathway results in the generation of MG, DG and palmitic acid. These intermediates are all up regulated in DENV infected cells and could be utilized for downstream signaling or de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. It has also been shown that TG catabolism is necessary for mitochondrial b-oxidation during DENV infection [50] . 6. Elevated levels of LPC in DENV infected cells also suggest activation of PC hydrolysis by PLA 2 . This enzyme is activated during DENV infection. The elevated levels of other phospholipids such as PA, PI, PE, PG as well as PC suggest that the CDG-DG pathway for phospholipid biosynthesis could also be activated.

The lipidomic analyses also indicated a down regulation of GlcCER, which may suggest that a salvage pathway that metabolizes GlcCER to CER may also be active.",

This is an attractive concept given that DENV replication complexes are encased within membrane barriers that need to facilitate the exchange of components to and from the cytosol for genome replication and virus assembly. Therefore, leaky membranes may be favored in DENV-infected cells through the selective incorporation of molecules such as LPC. Another observation that gives credence to this hypothesis is that the transmembrane permeabilizing effect of LPC is synergistically enhanced in the presence of palmitic acid, which is also up regulated in DENVinfected cells. As a signaling molecule, LPC is both a pro-survival as well as an inflammatory molecule [46] . Therefore, its expression in DENV infected cells could be a cellular response to viral infection.",

Consistent with these observations, several primary fatty acids (palmitic, stearic and oleic acid) involved in the biosynthesis of higher order PLs were detected in our lipidomic analyses. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid of the lipogenesis pathway and stearic acid (C18:0), is immediately downstream of palmitic acid. They are both up regulated in DENV infected cells. The latter is the precursor to the biosynthesis of oleic acid (C18:1) or long chain fatty acids (with acyl chains of C20 or greater). Interestingly, since oleic acid is down regulated in DENV-infected cells stearic acid may be stimulating long chain FA biosynthesis. However, a majority of the PLs expressed in DENV infected cells have C16-or C18-acyl chains with varying degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, it seems that desaturation of palmitic and stearic acid rather than elongation may be the chosen pathway for lipogenesis during DENV infection.",

This could be due to a similar scenario to SINV where a non-replicating UV-DENV is capable of inducing lipid conversion in membranes [52] . Therefore, SM and other sphingolipids may be converted to CER that is transported away from the 16K membrane fraction to other locations in the cell. This is also evident from the increased content of fatty acids compared to mock cells that may result from the degradation of lipids. UV-DENV exposed cells do not show significant regulation of MG or DG, but show an up regulation of palmitic acid (C16:0).

Several of the identified molecules also function as bioactive messengers that control signaling and membrane trafficking pathways in the cells. They represent molecules that result from the activation of cellular stress pathways that respond to viral infections. Based on these findings, the next steps will be to investigate the mechanisms of how these lipid species play a role in DENV replication, as well as identify the control points in these pathways that may be influenced by viral gene products.",

LC-MS datasets, defined as the data obtained from a single LC-MS analysis, were processed using the PRISM Data Analysis system [56] , a series of software tools freely available at http://ncrr.pnl.gov/software/ and developed in-house. The first step involved deisotoping of the raw MS data to give the monoisotopic mass, charge state, and intensity of the major peaks in each mass spectrum using Decon2LS [16] . The data were next examined in a 2-D fashion using MultiAlign to identify groups of mass spectral peaks that were observed in sequential spectra using an algorithm [57] that computes a Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space for combinations of peaks. Each group, generally ascribed to one detected species and referred to as a ''feature'', has a median monoisotopic mass, central normalized elution time (NET), and abundance estimate computed by summing the intensities of the MS peaks that comprise the entire LC-MS feature. LC-MS features were then chromatographically aligned across all datasets using the LCMSWARP algorithm [58] in MultiAlign, and the lipid identities of detected features were initially determined by comparing their measured monoisotopic masses and NETs to calculated monoisotopic masses and observed NETs for lipids in an AMT tag database [59] within search tolerances of 63 ppm and 60.03 NET for monoisotopic mass and elution time, respectively. Subsequent identifications of lipid features that did not match to entries in the AMT tag database were made by searching their molecular weights against entries in the Lipid MAPS database followed by manual confirmation based on MS/ MS spectra.",
