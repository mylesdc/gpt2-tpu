            "text": "Tissues obtained post-mortem from cattle persistently infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were analyzed to characterize the tissue-specific localization of FMDV and partial transcriptome profiles for selected immunoregulatory cytokines. Analysis of 28 distinct anatomic sites from 21 steers infected with FMDV serotype A, O or SAT2, had the highest prevalence of overall viral detection in the dorsal nasopharynx (80.95%) and dorsal soft palate (71.43%). FMDV was less frequently detected in laryngeal mucosal tissues, oropharyngeal mucosal sites, and lymph nodes draining the pharynx. Immunomicroscopy indicated that within persistently infected mucosal tissues, FMDV antigens were rarely detectable within few epithelial cells in regions of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Transcriptome analysis of persistently infected pharyngeal tissues by qRT-PCR for 14 cytokine genes indicated a general trend of decreased mRNA levels compared to uninfected control animals. Although, statistically significant differences were not observed, greatest suppression of relative expression (RE) was identified for IP-10 (RE = 0.198), IFN-\u03b2 (RE = 0.269), IL-12 (RE = 0.275), and IL-2 (RE = 0.312). Increased relative expression was detected for IL-6 (RE = 2.065). Overall, this data demonstrates that during the FMDV carrier state in cattle, viral persistence is associated with epithelial cells of the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory tract and decreased levels of mRNA for several immunoregulatory cytokines in the infected tissues.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is caused by FMD virus (FMDV), a member of the Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family [1] . FMD is one of the major constraints to international trade in animal products due to its extreme contagiousness and broad spectrum of host species that includes wild and domesticated ruminants and suids. Control and regional eradication of FMDV is complicated by the existence of seven serotypes and several subtypes, transmissibility by air, and occurrence of a prolonged asymptomatic carrier state in a large proportion of infected ruminants. Although the role of persistently infected ruminants in disease transmission remains unclear, the international standards on FMD from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) indicate that in order to regain FMD-free status countries must demonstrate freedom of FMD virus infection [2] . Thus asymptomatic FMDV carrier animals are perceived as a threat and the existence of the carrier state complicates regaining FMD-free status. On this basis, FMD-free countries generally will maintain trade barriers for animals and animal products from countries that have not demonstrated absence of FMDV including absence of carrier animals. [3] [4] [5] VanBekkum et al [6] were first to document the presence of infectious FMDV in oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) of asymptomatic cattle several weeks after infection. This was later confirmed by Sutmoller and Gaggero [7] . FMDV carrier animals were subsequently defined as 'any animal from which FMDV can be recovered in oropharyngeal scrapings using a probang sampling cup during periods greater than 28 days post infection (dpi)' [8] . FMDV persistence has been demonstrated to occur in cattle, sheep, goats, Asian buffalo, and various wildlife species [9] most notably the African buffalo [10] . Persistence occurs with variable incidence regardless of FMDV vaccination status, clinical outcome of infection, challenge strain and dose, and host factors including sex and age (reviewed by Salt [5] ). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inability of some animals to clear the virus including variations in the kinetics of the host response to FMDV infection [11] , viral mutation leading to antigenic variation [12] , or differences in the innate immune response [13] . However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and resolution of the carrier state remain undetermined.",

Similarly, several investigators have confirmed that collection of oropharyngeal sputum with a probang device was an effective manner of recovery of FMDV from carriers [6, 7, 14, 18] . However, this technique is incapable of indicating the identity of the specific tissues or cells within which the virus persists. Burrows was first to perform tissue-specific isolation of virus on FMDV carriers to identify the dorsal soft palate (i.e. floor of nasopharynx) as the site with greatest frequency of virus recovery and highest mean infectivity [14] . Furthermore, cell cultures derived from the pharynx of persistently infected cattle have been shown to remain FMDV-positive [19, 20] . Persistence can also be established in pharyngeal primary cell cultures from uninfected animals by FMDV infection ex vivo [21] .",

In a more recent study, Stenfeldt et al described the detection of low levels of FMDV RNA in biopsy samples of pharyngeal epithelia during persistent phases of infection. The lower FMDV RNA content compared to probang samples led to the conclusion that the targeted biopsy area within the DSP does not consistently harbor FMDV replication during persistent infection [22] .",

            "text": "It is well documented that FMDV subverts the early immune response particularly by targeting innate immune mechanisms (reviewed by Golde et al [23] ). This occurs through inhibitory effects on cytokine-driven pathways resulting in impaired function of antigen presenting cells and their precursors (reviewed by Grubman et al [24] ). This ultimately could lead to suboptimal immune function favoring viral replication and delaying onset of specific adaptive Tcell response. Interferon (IFN) types I, II, and III have been demonstrated to impair FMDV replication in vitro and in vivo [25] . In order to successfully replicate, FMDV blocks expression of IFN and other IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [25] . However, in vivo replication will induce synthesis of substantial levels of INF I/III [26] [27] [28] [29] . Other cytokines including IP-10, IL-2, IL-4,  IL-10, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 have been shown to affect FMDV replication through dendritic cells (DC) activation and maturation and NK cell recruitment, proliferation and activation (as reviewed by Toka et al [30] ). Additionally, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 [31] and RANTES [32] have also been associated with playing a role in controlling FMDV replication and spread.",

Earlier studies have reported that the epithelial cells of pharyngeal tissues [16, 17, 44] and/or retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph nodes [15, 44] are the predilection site for FMDV persistence in cattle. This consensus is challenged by a recent study that suggests that the DSP and the submandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes cannot be definitively concluded to be the principal sites for persistence of FMDV due to inconsistent detection of FMDV RNA in these tissues [22] .

            "text": "In the current study we confirmed that the critical and consistent anatomic regions involved in persistent FMDV infection in cattle are within the nasopharynx and larynx. This was accomplished through examination of up to 28 distinct tissues per animal from 21carrier cattle infected with one of three serotypes of FMDV. Specifically, dorsal nasopharynx, dorsal soft palate, and epiglottis had the greatest proportional detection of FMDV and FMDV RNA across all viruses. Interestingly, the tissues with the highest prevalence were located with tridimensional contiguity, forming the floor and roof of the nasopharynx. This anatomical region within Waldeyer's ring [45] has been reported to include primary sites of FMDV infection in cattle [22, 26, 35, 36, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Thus, these pharyngeal tissues have unique structural and/or functional properties that facilitate permissiveness to FMDV infection and maintenance during early and persistent phases of FMD. FMDV and FMDV RNA were also detected within ventral soft palate, ventral larynx, regional lymph nodes (retropharyngeal and submandibular) and tonsils (palatine and nasopharyngeal) at lower prevalence. These findings are consistent with previous studies [14, 51] and suggest that these tissues also may be involved in FMDV persistence, but with less consistency than the pharyngeal epithelia (MALT). Microscopic examination of numerous FMDV-positive nasopharyngeal tissues from confirmed carrier cattle indicated that no histopathological lesions were present in any animal. This suggests that the interaction of virus and host in the nasopharynx during the carrier state is quite different from what occurs during acute infection. The characteristic vesicles of feet and mouth, for which FMD is named, have classical microscopic lesions consisting of acantholytic degeneration of keratinocytes, epithelial spongiosis, and sloughing of affected regions with resultant erosions [41, 52] . Primary infection of the nasopharyngeal epithelium of cattle induces a less severe extent of an apparently similar process resulting in keratinocyte degeneration and ultimately cell loss (erosion) [36] . By contrast, the nasopharyngeal epithelium of carriers was consistently found to be intact with no evidence of erosion even in areas in which FMDV antigen was localized. This lack of evidence of cellular degeneration of FMDV-infected cells in carriers suggests a distinct mechanism in which infected cells survive and remain within the carrier's epithelium. These findings are consistent with previously published suggestion that in the carrier state, FMDV employs a distinct, non-cytolytic infection process which may be driven by alterations in cytokine signaling cascades and/or tissue specific decreased cell death mechanisms [3, 53] .",

In regions where antigen was found, it was localized to foci of individual, or small clusters of, immunopositive cells. This contrasts previous reports that have demonstrated regionally diffuse localization of FMDV RNA by in situ hybridization in the pharynx of carrier cattle [16, 17] . The reason for this difference in localization is unclear, but may further support the concept of a limited virus replication cycle in carriers whereby only a subset of FMDV RNA-containing cells progress to producing viral antigens. The phenotypic profile of intra-epithelial cells containing FMDV antigens was uniformly cytokeratin (+)/ CD11c(-)/MHCII(-). This suggests that replication of FMDV in the pharyngeal epithelium of carrier cattle occurs in epithelial cells rather than intra-epithelial dendritic (Langerhans-like) cells.",

Recent reports from our laboratory describing the acute phase of FMD in cattle demonstrated modest induction of some of the same cytokine genes at these same tissues [26] and tissue-specific induction of IFN signaling pathways [53] . In the acute phase of infection, FMDV is largely similar to several other viral infections that generally induce proinflammatory and antiviral innate immune responses [13, 26, 28, [53] [54] [55] [56] . By contrast, there are examples wherein the persistent phase of FMDV and other viral infections have been shown to be associated with suppression or modulation the host immune response [13, 57, 58] . Thus, our demonstration of relative suppression of transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-12 and RANTES has some similarity to the suppressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines observed in herpes simplex virus type 1 during persistence [59] . However, no conclusive reports of immune system gene suppression have been published associated with FMDV persistent infection. Indeed, two studies have demonstrated upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 in tissues of cattle persistently infected with FMDV [13, 34] . Additionally, decreased detection of IFN-\u03b2 and lower IFN signaling capacity have been demonstrated during the acute phase of FMDV infection of cattle [13, 53] .",

            "text": "The establishment of persistent FMDV infection provides an example of a classic pathogenesis battle in which the pathogen achieves victory over the defeated host immune response. However, the mechanism whereby FMDV evades the host response is still unclear. Considering the current transcriptome data in the context of previously published works allows some novel insights into the mechanisms that contributed to this process. It is well established that FMDV is highly sensitive to IFNs type I, II, and III [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] and several studies have documented IFN production by cattle as part of the acute response to FMDV infection [13, 26, 68] . Thus, the decreased relative expression of mRNAs for IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 in pharyngeal tissues of the FMDV carriers described herein suggests an association between transcription suppression of these genes and the FMDV carrier state. Specifically, our findings of a 3 to 4-fold suppression of IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression amongst carriers suggests immunomodulation that may benefit the persistence of FMDV as has been suggested by other investigators [13, 34] . However, the causality of this association remains undermined; specifically, one might consider whether 1) FMDV dysregulated the expression of these genes thus enabling the carrier state or 2) a subset of cattle are intrinsically poor producers of IFN and it is these animals that ultimately become carriers. Previous work describing gene expression in tissues with different FMDV tropism from non-infected cattle suggested that pharyngeal tissues are intrinsically poor type I and III IFN inducers and responders, and this might explain their susceptibility to both primary and persistent infection (Zhu et al 2013) . The results of the current study are consistent with those findings.",

Specifically, in the current study IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was decreased more than 2-fold among carrier animals. IFN-\u03b3 induces the production of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), which together with IL-4 is involved in epidermal DC activation, maturation and function [69, 70] . Mature DC are able to produce IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 and these cytokines are involved in NK cell recruitment, proliferation and activation that would ultimately eliminate FMDV infected cells (as reviewed by Toka et al [71] ). In the current report, we have documented more than 2-fold suppression of IP-10 and IL-4, as well as IL-2 and IL-12, up to 2-fold suppression for IL-18, and no substantial effect on IL-15 in the persistently infected tissues of carriers. Thus, these alterations of regional cytokine microenvironment may preclude the cellular pathways that are required to eliminate FMDV infected cells.",

            "text": "The current work has contributed to further defining the anatomical sites and host processes associated with persistence of FMDV in cattle. Trimodal detection of infectious FMDV, FMDV RNA, and viral antigen has confirmed the importance of the nasopharyngeal mucosal surfaces as sites of FMDV persistence. Although it is well-established that FMDV has immunomodulatory effects at various tissues at various stages of infection, precise understanding of these processes remains elusive. Through comparison of cytokine transcription levels in persistently infected tissues of FMDV-carrier cattle compared to controls, we have demonstrated a general trend of suppression of transcription of most genes examined including type I and II IFN and various interleukins. Although the effects were not statistically significant, there was an undeniable lack of immunostimulation which is often an expected result of a pathogen infection and has been previously reported for FMDV [26] [27] [28] [29] . Further elucidation of viral modulation of host factors associated with the carrier state will reveal mechanisms that may be targeted in order to prevent or cure FMDV persistence. Such efforts are currently underway in our laboratory.",
