            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly detected porcine coronavirus causing serious vomiting and diarrhea in piglets, especially newborn piglets. There has been an outbreak of PDCoV in worldwide since 2014, causing significant economic losses in the pig industry. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response is an important component of virus-host interactions and plays an essential role in inhibiting virus infection. However, the mechanism of PDCoV escaping the porcine immune surveillance is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein antagonizes porcine IFN-\u03b2 production after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection or poly(I:C) stimulation. PDCoV N protein also suppressed the activation of porcine IFN-\u03b2 promoter when it was stimulated by porcine RLR signaling molecules. PDCoV N protein targeted porcine retinoic acid-inducible gene I (pRIG-I) and porcine TNF receptor associated factor 3 (pTRAF3) by directly interacting with them. The N-terminal region (1-246 aa) of PDCoV N protein was important for interacting with pRIG-I and interfere its function. We confirmed that PDCoV N antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by associating with pRIG-I to impede it from binding double-stranded RNA. Furthermore, porcine Riplet (pRiplet) was an important activator for pRIG-I by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, PDCoV N protein restrained the pRiplet binding pRIG-I to inhibit pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism by which PDCoV N protein interferes with the early activation of pRIG-I in the host antiviral response. The novel findings provide a new insight into PDCoV on evading the host innate immune response and may provide new therapeutic targets and more efficacious vaccines strategies for PDCoV infections.",

            "text": "The host innate immune response serves as the first line of defense to resist pathogenic microorganism infection and replication. The viral pathogen is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the infected host cells to induce an antiviral response. The retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are a major member of host PRRs, including three homologous protein, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5), and DExH-box helicase 58 (DHX58/LGP2) (11). RIG-I and MDA5 were the activators of interferon production post RNA virus infection or the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog polyinosine and polycytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) (12) . RIG-I also resides in an autorepression state in normal physiological status cells by covering its N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which are necessary for interaction with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif) (13) (14) (15) . The Riplet, also known as ring finger protein 135 (RNF135), is a necessary E3 ligase for releasing RIG-I autorepression by K63-linked polyubiquitination (16) . The tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) is another key E3 ligase for RIG-I activation by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I Nterminal CARDs (17) . However, MDA5 does not adopt an auto-repression state in the ligand-free state (11). MDA5 also interacts with MAVS via CARDs to active the type I interferon signaling pathway. The MAVS as the polymeric signaling scaffold could recruit and activate the signaling proteins including tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF3, TRAF5, TRAF6, and associated serine kinases (TBK1 and the IKK family) (18, 19) . The activation of TBK1 could activate master transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB translocation into the cell nucleus, and then induce the antiviral genes' production, including IFN-\u03b2 and major antiviral cytokines (20) . Type I IFNs are secreted and bind to the cell surface receptors of both virusinfected and non-infected neighbor cells to induce interferonstimulating genes (ISGs) for antivirals by activating the JAK-STAT pathway.",

The cells were lysed for the dual-luciferase reporter assays. The results showed that the VSV-GFP or poly(I:C) induced porcine IFN-\u03b2-luc promoter activation was significantly suppressed by PDCoV-N protein in PK-15 cells (Figures 1A,C) . However, the porcine NF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activation was not inhibited by PDCoV-N protein in PK-15 cells, when infected with VSV-GFP virus ( Figure 1B) . To further prove that PDCoV N protein inhibits porcine IFN-\u03b2 production, PK-15 cells were transfected with PDCoV-N expression or empty vector plasmid for 24 h and then transfected or non-transfected with poly(I:C) for 12 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells to detect the expression level of porcine IFN-\u03b2 and several interferon-induced genes (ISGs) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that PDCoV N overexpression could significantly suppress poly(I:C)-induced porcine IFNB1 (pIFNB1), porcine OAS1 (pOAS1), and porcine ISG15 (pISG15) mRNA expression in PK-15 cells ( Figure 1D ). The results indicated that PDCoV N protein suppressed porcine IFN-\u03b2 production. IFN-\u03b2 could significantly inhibit the VSV replication in infected host cells. Hence, to further confirm the porcine IFN\u03b2 protein production decreased by PDCoV N protein, VSV-GFP viruses were used to infect PK-15 cells. The results showed that poly(I:C) could significantly suppress the VSV-GFP replication in PK-15 cells (Figure 1E ). In accordance with the results of dual luciferase assays and qRT-PCR described above, the expression of PDCoV N protein could restore the proliferation of VSV-GFP virus in ploy(I:C)-treated PK-15 cells ( Figure 1E) .

These results suggested that PDCoV N protein could directly interact with pRIG-I and pTRAF3. To further confirm the direct interaction between PDCoV N and pRIG-I in porcine cells, PK-15 cells were used to co-transfect the pRIG-I or pTRAF3 and PDCoV N expression plasmid. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed at 24 h post transfection. The results showed that the PDCoV N protein and pRIG-I or pTRAF3 were co-localized in the cytoplasm in PK-15 cells ( Figure 3E ). All the data indicated that pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were the major targets of PDCoV N protein in the pRLR signaling pathway. RIG-I are the key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors to recognize the RNA viruses. The activation of RIG-I was a prerequisite of IFN-\u03b2 production by RLR signaling pathway. However, in the present study, PDCoV N protein could significantly block the pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Figure 2A) . Hence, pRIG-I was the main object in the following study. To investigate the interaction between PDCoV N protein and pRIG-I, two truncated mutants of PDCoV N protein(aa 1 to 246, and 168-342) were constructed and cotransfected with Flag-pRIG-I into HEK293T cells. The Co-IP results showed that the PDCoV N(1-246aa), but not another truncated region, could clearly coprecipitated with pRIG-I ( Figure 3F ). PDCoV N(1-246aa) was also significantly arrested pRIG-I induced porcine IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in PK-15 and IPEC-J2 cells (Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 2) . These results indicated that the N-terminal region was important for PDCoV N protein to interact with pRIG-I and interfere its function. ",

            "text": "Previous researchers have reported that PDCoV NS6 inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production by suppressing the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding human RIG-I and MDA5 in HEK293T cells (31) . In the present study, PDCoV N protein was proved as a directly pRIG-I binding protein (Figure 3) . It is unclear whether PDCoV N could compete with porcine RIG-I to bind dsRNA. To verify this assumption, the poly(I:C) binding assay was performed. pRIG-I or PDCoV-N was eukaryotic expressed by transfection in HEK293T cells, respectively. After 28 h, the WCLs were immunoprecipitated with poly(I:C) (dsRNA) or poly(C) (ssRNA) beads. The results showed that PDCoV-N and pRIG-I could bind to the poly(I:C)-beads ( Figure 4A) . However, only PDCoV N protein could bind to the poly(C)-beads ( Figure 4B) . pRIG-I and dose-increased PDCoV-N expression plasmid were cotransfected in HEK293T cells. After 28 h, the WCLs were immunoprecipitated with poly(I:C)-beads. The results showed that the PDCoV N protein could decrease the binding of dsRNA and pRIG-I in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D) . The results indicated that PDCoV N protein could compete the binding of dsRNA with pRIG-I. However, in our previous study, we also found PDCoV N protein could directly interact with porcine RIG-I without dsRNA (Figures 3A,B) . This indicated that PDCoV N protein may have other functions in regulated porcine RIG-I. Previous finding indicated that viral protein could also inhibit RIG-I activation by suppressing its polyubiquitination (21, 22, 25) . To explore the role of PDCoV N protein in pRIG-I ubiquitination, pRIG-I expression plasmid were cotransfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) and PDCoV N or empty plasmid in PK-15 or HEK293T cells for 28 h. The porcine RIG-I was purification by Flag affinity gel. Then, the polyubiquitination levels of pRIG-I were examined by western blot. The results showed that the polyubiquitination of pRIG-I was significantly increased, and the polyubiquitination were remarkably decreased by PDCoV N protein both in HA-tagged ubiquitin transfected PK-15 or HEK293T cells (Figures 5A,B) . To further study which formation of pRIG-I linked-polyubiquitination was suppressed by PDCoV N protein, the ubiquitin K48R or K63R (HA-Ub-K48R or HA-Ub-K63R) mutant expression plasmid was used to co-transfect with porcine RIG-I together with PDCoV-N expression or empty plasmid in HEK293T cells. The results showed that PDCoV N protein could decrease the pRIG-I K48R but not K63R-induced polyubiquitination ( Figure 5C ). To further verify the results, the ubiquitin K63 or K48 (HA-Ub-K48 or HA-Ub-K63) only expression mutant plasmid was used to do the same experiments. PDCoV N protein could significantly decrease the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination, but not the K48-linked polyubiquitination ( Figure 5D ). All the results indicated that PDCoV N protein could suppress the pRIG-I polyubiquitination, especially the K63-linked polyubiquitination.",

To further explore the mechanism of PDCoV-N suppression of pRIG-I K63-polyubiquitination, porcine TRIM25 (pTRIM25) and Riplet (pRiplet) were mainly analyzed. pTRIM25 and pRiplet have only 77.93 and 67.38% identity to human TRIM25 (hTRIM25) and Riplet (hRiplet) by amino acids sequence analysis, respectively ( Figure 6A) . The pTRIM25 or pRiplet expression plasmid was constructed and expressed in PK-15 cells (Figure 6B) . To explore the function of pTRIM25 or pRiplet in pRIG-I induced IFN-\u03b2 production, the pTRIM25, or pRiplet was cotransfected with pRIG-I and pGL3-pIFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK-Luc plasmid in PK-15 cells for 28 h. The results showed that pRiplet could significantly promote pRIG-I-induced pIFN\u03b2-Luc activation ( Figure 6C) . However, pTRIM25 could not influence pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2-Luc activation (Figure 6C) . The consistent results were observed in the IPEC-J2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A) .

The PDCoV N protein was detected in the WCLs by western blot (Figure 6D) .

The results showed that pRiplet could directly interact with pRIG-I (Figures 7A,B) .

Further analysis found that pRIG-I ubiquitination or K63-linked polyubiquitination was remarkably increased when the cells were cotransfected with pRiplet (Figures 7D,E) . However, the PDCoV N protein expression could significantly decrease the pRiplet-induced pRIG-I ubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination (Figures 7C,D) .

However, previous reports have indicated that the different coronavirus N protein as an IFN antagonist intervened with the RLR signaling pathway by targeting different signaling proteins. SARS-CoV N protein antagonized IFN-\u03b2 in the initial signaling pathway (38). The protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) is a cellular dsRNA-binding protein potentiating IFN production by binding to RIG-I and MDA5 (39, 40) . The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV N protein could interact with PACT to suppress the dsRNA translocated to RIG-I and MDA5 (36) . The PEDV N protein was found to interact with human TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 to inhibit the human TBK1/IRF3 complex confirmed to suppress IFN-\u03b2 production (26) . In the present study, we proved that PDCoV N directly interacts with pRIG-I and pTRAF3 (Figure 3) , which is different from the previously reported coronavirus N protein, such as PEDV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV.C-terminal region of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was critical for antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 response (38). However, the N-terminal region was necessary for PDCoV N protein to inhibit porcine IFN-\u03b2 response by targeting pRIG-I (Figures 3F,G) . Furthermore, we also found that PDCoV N protein significantly inhibited the porcine IRF3 induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. However, the PDCoV N protein was showed not interacting with porcine IRF3 protein, suggesting another target signal molecule of PDCoV N protein may exist in the downstream of porcine IRF3.",

            "text": "RIG-I and MDA5 contain three similar structures: 2 \u2032 CARDs, HEL, and C-terminal domain (CTD) (15) . RIG-I and MDA5 sense distinct RNAs depending on their different C-terminal structures. The C-terminal structure of human RIG-I contains a conservative internal repressor domain (RD), but this is not found in MDA5 (15) . In the present study, we found that PDCoV N protein could directly interact with porcine RIG-I but not porcine MDA5. In addition, the RD domain was important for PDCoV N protein interacting with porcine RIG-I ( Figure 6F ). This may explain why PDCoV N protein specifically binds to porcine RIG-I. Viral nucleic acids as pathogen associated molecular pattern are sensed by the host pattern recognition receptors after a viral infection. RIG-I and MDA5 are the major members of intracytoplasmic pathogenic molecular pattern recognition receptors that sense the intracellular viral RNA. Hence, one mechanism of the RNA virus escaping from host immune surveillance is to protect its ssRNA or dsRNA not to be recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. The MERS 4a protein is a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with PACT in an RNA-dependent manner but not with RIG-I or MDA5, which suppresses the PACT-induced activation of RIG-I and MDA5 (41) . PDCoV accessory protein 6 (NS6) could not bind dsRNA or ssRNA. However, eukaryotic-expression of PDCoV NS6 in HEK293T cells has been found to directly interact with human RIG-I and MDA5, and suppresses the host recognition of dsRNA (31) . In the present study, PDCoV N protein was proven as a new member competing with porcine RIG-I binding dsRNA ( Figure 4B ). This is a mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine IFN-\u03b2 induction (Figure 8) . It is noteworthy that the NS6 protein must be synthesized in infection cells, unlike the N protein, which can come from the parent virus itself. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis that there may be a synergistic effect between PDCoV N protein and NS6 protein. In the early stage of virus infection, especially before the synthesis of NS6 protein, the competitive binding dsRNA of PDCoV N protein inhibits the activation of pRIG-I. With the synthesis and expression of NS6 protein, the function of PDCoV N protein is replaced by NS6, which is conducive to N protein binding the viral gRNA to complete the assembly of progeny virus.",

The E3 ubiquitin ligase Riplet is shown to active RIG-I by K63-linked polyubiqutination. Activation of JAK-STAT pathway by IFNs binding its receptor induces the production of ISGs, such as OAS1, ISG15.

            "text": "Ubiquitination is an important posttranslational modification in regulating the activation of signaling molecules. The E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM25, TRIM4, and Riplet were proven to catalyze the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I in CARDs and CTD, respectively (17, (45) (46) (47) . Suppressing the ubiquitin ligases binding with its target protein is another means of virus interfering with the host IFN-\u03b2 production. AIV NS1 protein also could suppress RIG-I activation by species-specific interaction with TRIM25 or Riplet (21) . The West Nile virus NS1 also antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by inhibiting RIG-I and MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination (22) . The SARS-CoV N protein directly interacts with human TRIM25 to suppress the RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination (25) . The MERS-CoV N protein has a similar function as SARS-CoV N to inhibit RIG-I activation (25) . However, we found that PDCoV N protein neither interacts with pTRIM25 nor pRiplet (Figures 5D-G) . In the present study, we also found that pTRIM25 could not promote the activation of pRIG-I induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter ( Figure 6C ). It indicated that the role of homologous proteins among different species might be different in regulating the activation of RLR signaling pathway. This may be an important reason for coronavirus N protein interaction with different proteins to regulate the host innate immunity in different hosts.",

            "text": "The mechanism of Riplet-mediated RIG-I activation remains unclear. hRiplet could promote the K63-linked polyubiquitination of the RIG-I CARD domain, which was indispensable for interaction between Riplet and RIG-I (34, 48) . However, hRiplet was also found mainly interacting with the RIG-I RD domain and promoting the RD domain K63-linked polyubiquitination to release RIG-I autorepression (16, 47) . In the present study, we found that pRiplet, as the homologous gene of hRiplet, could directly interact with pRIG-I, which was dispensable for the HEL and RD domain but not the CARD domain (Figure 7) . pRilet mediated pRIG-I activation by increasing the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, PDCoV N protein could suppress the pRiplet-mediated pRIG-I activation to induce IFN-\u03b2 production. Further exploration demonstrated that PDCoV N protein blocked the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination by interfering pRiplet binding to pRIG-I (Figure 8) . Two theories of the interfering binding mechanism might exist: First, because of the same target domains of PDCoV N protein and pRiplet binding pRIG-I, they may be competitively binding pRIG-I. On the other hand, we found that pRiplet mainly binds to the HEL domain of pRIG-I (Figure 7D) , while PDCoV N protein mainly binds to the CTD of pRIG-I ( Figure 7G) . The human RIG-I CTD could interact with the HEL and CARD domain to self-repression (15) . Hence, another reason is that the protein conformation of pRIG-I might be changed after binding to PDCoV N protein, which leading the pRiplet could not interact with pRIG-I. To our knowledge, this is the first time that coronavirus N protein has been reported to interfere the host immune system by directly targeting host RIG-I. These results provide insight into a novel mechanism of PDCoV inhibiting the host antiviral response.",
