In recent years, there has been a significant increase in our understanding of the routes and mechanisms of entry for a number of these viruses. This has led to the development of novel broad-spectrum antiviral approaches that target host cell proteins and pathways, in addition to strategies focused on individual viruses or virus families. Here we consider a number of these approaches and their broad-spectrum potential. PubMed Abstract | Publisher Full Text 2. Mercer J, Schelhaas M, Helenius A: Virus entry by endocytosis.

Once inside a cell, a virus still needs to overcome a hostile environment, evade immune responses, and subvert a range of cellular proteins and pathways to facilitate its replication. However, finding a permissive cell and delivering genetic information into its cytoplasm, and in some cases nucleus, is the first necessary step for viral infection. This has at least two important implications from a prophylactic and/or therapeutic perspective. The first is that blocking viral entry stops infection early on, preventing viral replication. The second is that because many viruses exploit cellular endocytic mechanisms to initiate internalization and infection, and cells have just a few such mechanisms, inhibiting these pathways may affect many different viruses, greatly expanding our currently limited antiviral portfolio.",

For enveloped viruses, the virus lipid bilayer needs to fuse with the cellular limiting membrane (either the plasma membrane or the membrane of endocytic organelles) to release the viral genome, and this is mediated by viral envelope proteins. For non-enveloped viruses, genome release is affected by viral capsid proteins that trigger cell membrane penetration and genome release.",

Regardless of the requirement to engage specific receptors, viruses often use non-specific electrostatic interactions with negatively charged sugars to attach to a cell surface until they encounter a specific entry receptor. Negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are expressed on the surface of most eukaryotic cells and have been shown to be required for the binding of many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papilloma virus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and flaviviruses 7-10 . Inhibition of these interactions through the development of \"decoy\" particles mimicking these molecules (heparin, sulfated polysaccharides, or sulfonic acid-coated nanoparticle) can effectively prevent infection in vitro. However, limited efficacy is seen in vivo, possibly owing to the poor bioavailability of these formulations. While high-molecular-weight molecules with a high degree of sulfation have the highest antiviral activity in vitro, these compounds tend to bind to plasma proteins and have poor bioavailability 11,12 . Conversely, low-molecular-weight compounds have better bioavailability and are more effective in vivo 13 but are also associated with higher cytotoxicity, possibly owing to detergent effects on cellular membranes.",

Both virus-and cell-targeted approaches have been studied to prevent the interaction between influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and sialic acids (SA) on glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors. Virus-targeted strategies include the use of protease inhibitors that block the processing of HA and peptides or small molecules that interfere with HA binding to SA. The most promising cell-targeted strategy is the attachment inhibitor DAS181, a recombinant protein made of a sialidase catalytic domain (which removes SA from influenza receptors) and a mucosal cell-surface anchoring sequence. This compound, highly potent in vitro (IC 50 between 0.04 and 0.9 nM), has been shown to be non-toxic to cells and to be effective in vivo when administered pre-and post-exposure 19 .

Scientists from Janssen developed such an approach starting from the identification of a broadly neutralizing antibody, bnAbCR6261, that targets a conserved region in the stem of influenza HA.

Similarly, vaccinia virus (VV) entry requires signaling through epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), serine/threonine kinases, protein kinase C, and p21-activated kinase 1 in addition to PI3K, and entry of at least some VV strains is sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein 38 .

However, using endocytosis assays, we were able to show that CME of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus and of fluorescently labeled transferrin was significantly reduced by both compounds 45 .

Fusion is mediated by virally encoded envelope glycoproteins displayed on the virion surface. Viruses require cellular cues to induce conformational changes in these envelope glycoproteins to initiate fusion with cellular membranes, in some cases the plasma membrane, and, for many viruses, endosomal membranes. For some viruses that fuse at the cell surface, such as HIV, receptor engagement provides the cue that initiates the envelope glycoprotein conformational changes and fusion 50 . But for many viruses a common cue is the acidic pH of endosomal environments 1,3,51 . Weak bases, including the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and carboxylic ionophores such as monensin, can inhibit endosomal acidification and block infection by a wide range of viruses in vitro 1,52,53 , but, with the exception of amantadine, few studies have tested their efficacy in vivo.

Elevation of endosomal potassium may also provide cues that activate the fusion proteins of some bunyaviruses and influenza viruses, and infection can be restricted by compounds that inhibit endosomal potassium channels 62 .

LJ001 is a small molecule which oxidizes the unsaturated phospholipids of both cellular and viral membranes 79 . This is likely to alter membrane curvature and fluidity, preventing fusion. Interestingly, while affecting both cellular and viral membranes, only the latter are significantly affected, most likely because the cellular membrane can rapidly replace damaged lipids, a property that viruses do not share 80 . This makes LJ001 effective in vitro against a wide variety of viruses including influenza, and with very limited toxicity. Unfortunately, little effectiveness was seen in vivo, owing to a short half-life (~4 hours) and low concentration of the compound in serum. Furthermore, LJ001 needs light to activate, which limits its application in vivo. Nevertheless, analogues with improved stability and pharmacokinetics are being developed 79 .",

            "text": "Host cell entry is a crucial step for most viruses, and preventing entry provides a clear early opportunity to control infection. As viruses use just a few conserved cellular pathways for entry, targeting cellular proteins rather than viral proteins has emerged as a promising antiviral strategy. Indeed, many of the approaches that have been investigated in the past few years target host rather than viral components, even when the target is highly selective for one specific virus, as is the case for maraviroc 22 . This is in line with a recent trend in the development of antiviral strategies 51,81 . To date, small-molecule interference with viral infection has tended to focus on specific viruses and viral proteins. For a few viruses, HIV, HCV, and herpes, for example, this approach has been very effective. In the case of HIV at least, combinations of compounds targeting key viral enzymes essential for completion of the viral life cycle (e.g. HIV Pol-encoded reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease) control virus replication in infected patients, substantially improve longevity and life quality, and are now being adopted as pre-and post-exposure prophylactics to prevent virus infection 82, 83 . Similarly, nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors active against HCV have the potential to cure what would otherwise be a lifelong chronic infection often resulting in cirrhosis and liver cancer and only treatable by liver transplantation 84 . Though highly successful, these drugs are limited to the treatment of single viruses and are prone to viral resistance mutations rendering them ineffective.",

            "text": "Conversely, very few drugs are available for use against the majority of other viruses. This is a major concern given the increased emergence (or re-emergence) of new pathogens, often from zoonotic infections (e.g. SARS and MERS), and the enlarged geographical distribution of insect-vectored viruses caused by environmental changes (e.g. Zika and dengue 85 ). Under these circumstances, targeting host cell pathways as opposed to viral proteins is a viable option for controlling infection. One argument against this approach is the potential toxicity of targeting host cell pathways. Toxicity could be due to the inhibition of critical cellular pathways as well as to off-target effects. However, most of the virus infections that might benefit from this approach establish acute infections for which drug administration could be as short as a few days. Moreover, most drugs currently on the market against a range of diseases target host cell pathways with limited, or acceptable, side effects. Another argument is that virus-targeted antivirals seem to be more potent than cell-targeted ones. This concern is counter-balanced by the potential for broad-spectrum effectiveness of many cell-targeted approaches, which may be critical to rapidly contain emerging viruses. Because of lower potency, these compounds might not stop virus infection completely, but several studies indicate that, in general, any capacity to reduce the viral load gives patients a better chance of establishing effective immune control 86-89 .",

Although we have focused on virus entry, targeting other cellular pathways, such as ER-associated glycoprotein synthesis, also offers exciting potential for broadspectrum antiviral development that could broaden potential combination therapies 90 . This strategy could also reduce toxicity by allowing the use of lower concentrations of each component in complex formulations.",

In particular for host-targeted approaches, it will be important to determine safe thresholds that separate an effective decrease in viral load from toxicity. The limited in vivo efficacy of many treatments to date may be due to the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the compounds, or possibly to the limited range of conditions that are generally tested in vivo due to the costs, logistics, and restrictions on animal studies. Limited availability of adequate small models that recapitulate disease also contributes to the problem. While more work remains to be done, the approval of drugs like maraviroc and enfuvirtide suggests that targeting viral entry is a promising antiviral strategy warranting further investigation and the integration of different disciplines, from virology to medicinal chemistry.
