In this study four functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, H/L, X/Y, P/Q and A/B) across the MBL2 gene were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing of PCR products in a case-control population of Chinese Han origin, consisting of 1,020 patients with pulmonary TB and 1,020 controls. We found that individuals carrying variant allele at A/B (namely BB or AB genotypes) was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (odds ratios [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-1.91, P = 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). Additionally, LYPB haplotype showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.27-1.87, P = 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; global haplotype association P = 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). Furthermore, individuals bearing low-or medium-MBL expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of TB (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.29-1.90, P = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). Thus, the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having MBL2 variants may partially mediate the increased susceptibility to TB risk.",

Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 (codon 52 A/D, codon 54 A/B, and codon 57 A/C) and in the promoter and 5\u2032 -untranslated regions (nt \u2212 550 H/L, nt \u2212 221 X/Y, and nt + 4 P/Q) of the MBL2 gene are associated with serum levels and/ or functions of MBL. These genetic variations are associated with a wide variety of diseases, including respiratory tract infections 3, [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, in previously reported studies MBL2 polymorphisms have conflicting results showing protection from or susceptibility to TB 5 . For example, low levels of MBL (associated with variant alleles at the promoter and exon 1 regions of the MBL2 gene) were reported to protect against tuberculosis 12, 13 , supporting the hypothesis that MBL binding can enhance the uptake of intracellular pathogens by phagocytes, and then promote infection 12, 14 . Other investigators instead claim that protection against the disease is associated with high levels of MBL (controlled by the wild MBL2 alleles) [15] [16] [17] [18] . In the Chinese Han population, no convincing evidence of association between MBL2 sequence variants and TB was observed [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . For example, in a meta-analysis totally including 880 TB patients and 959 controls of Chinese origin, Shi J and colleagues reported that variants at A/B were associated with increased susceptibility to TB 20 . Additionally, Chen M and colleagues found that variants in Y/X was associated with increased susceptibility to TB among Chinese 21, 22 . However, most recently Wu L reported that variants in H/L, but not Y/X, P/Q or A/B, were associated with decreased susceptibility to TB among Chinese 23 . Conflicting results are not unexpected in association studies for several reasons, including small sample size, marginal statistical significance, detection of genotypes, or ethnic heterogeneity. Therefore, here we conducted a genetic association study in a large case-control population of Chinese Han origin (totally consisting of 1,020 patients with TB and 1,020 controls), to better define the association between the MBL2 SNPs and TB.",

About and + 4 (P/Q, rs7095891) and the structural polymorphism at nt + 230 (codon 54 A/B, rs1800450) of the MBL2 gene were selected for genotyping by use of PCR direct sequencing in the case-control population. The PCR primers were designed using the web-based software Primer3 (available at: http://primer3.ut.ee/). The forward primer 5\u2032 -ATGGGAGGAGGATTCAAGG-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032 -CCTTGTGACACTGCGTGACT-3\u2032 were used for amplifying the target region containing the MBL2 H/L and Y/X variants. The forward primer 5\u2032 -CGGTCCCATTTGTTCTCACT-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032 -CACAAACTGCTGTGTGGAAT-3\u2032 were used for amplifying the target region containing the MBL2 P/Q and A/B variants. Then the PCR products were sequenced by an ABI 3730 sequencer. A nucleotide was identified as a candidate polymorphism by an observer using the PolyPhred program (available at: http://droog.gs.washington.edu/polyphred/) and confirmed by another observer independently. Genotyping of all samples was performed in a blinded manner so that the case or control status was unknown. The call rates were 100% for all SNPs. The accuracy of genotyping data for each SNP was validated by masking, choosing at random, and resequencing 5% of the samples from the opposite strand.",

Differences of mean age between TB patients and controls were analyzed using the unpaired t test (SPSS software, version 10.0). Genotype frequencies for each SNPs were determined by gene counting. The significance of deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the online software SNPStats (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats_web). Unconditional logistic regressions under a dominant inheritance model were used due to the limited sample size, to calculate P values, Odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessing the association between SNPs and disease risk, adjusting for age and gender (fixed effects). In additional analyses, age and gender were treated as random effects in the logistic regression to deal with the uncertainties with more flexibility. The glm-function and glmer-function in the lme4 package (version 1.1-12) 33 of R (version 3.3.1) 34 were used to fit the models with fixed effects and random effects, respectively. To show the robustness of the conclusions, we performed resampling statistics as previously reported 35 . The P values, ORs, and 95% CIs in single SNP analyses were calculated by a bootstrapping test with the number of simulations was set to 10,000,000. As to multiple comparisons, the correction factor n(m-1) (in which there are n loci with m alleles) was used to correct the significance level.",
