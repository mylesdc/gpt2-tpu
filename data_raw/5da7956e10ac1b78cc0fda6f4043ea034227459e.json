Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0-18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. Results: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2-18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia.",

The immune response in RSV infection differs according to age [15] . Notably, inefficient and ineffective immune responses in early life contribute to more severe clinical courses and higher incidence of RSV infection; this is especially problematic in infants, who are most frequently affected by RSV pneumonia [15] . These findings may be valuable to guide therapeutic approaches, such as application of immune-modulatory drugs for enhancement of immune responses, and preventive strategies for children with CAP; moreover, the results of the present study suggest that the development of strategies to prevent RSV infection, especially in infants and younger children, might aid in decreasing the worldwide disease burden due to CAP. The number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia was typically highest between October and November. In the previous studies, the peak incidence of MP pneumonia showed a similar pattern to that observed in the present study, regardless of age [14, 16] . However, in the 2011 Korean epidemic, the peak rate of hospitalization due to MP pneumonia in children occurred in September, whereas the peak rate in the 2015 epidemic occurred in November. In addition, the number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia in the 2015 epidemic was smaller than that in the 2011 epidemic. These findings were consistent with the results of another study [16] . The reasons for these phenomenon may be associated with exposure to MP in the previous epidemic [7] .",

            "text": "Based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, the macrolide resistance rates of MP pneumonia have recently been identified as 50-90% in Asia [7, 8] ; these rates differ dramatically among nations. When we Post hoc analyses were used to examine if the characteristics of MP pneumonia groups were statistically significant with chi-squared test. For the continuous variables, one-way ANOVA tests were conducted to compare groups, followed by Mann-Whitney U test defined clinical MSMP, MLEP, and MRMP according to fever duration after the initiation of macrolides in each pneumonia episode, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, the ratios of clinical MLEP and MRMP of total MP pneumonia showed increasing trends after adjustment for monthly time series. However, the estimated clinical MRMP/total MP pneumonia ratio during the study period in the present study (0.0-11.0%) was far lower than that based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests (50-90%, especially in Asia) [7, 8] . Therefore, the results of our present study suggest that the clinical response to macrolides in MP pneumonia in the real world might not be as weak as that has been reported, based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, which could partially be due to the self-limiting features of MP infections [17] . Due to the high prevalence of MRMP, there are a great deal of concerns regarding second-line treatment options for MRMP, including tetracycline or fluoroquinolones [7] . Some previous studies have reported no significant differences with respect to clinical and radiologic findings between MRMP and MSMP pneumonia in children [8, 9] . When combined with the results of the present and previous studies [8, 13] , a considerable proportion of cases of macrolide-resistant MP pneumonia might be recategorized as clinical MSMP or MLEP pneumonia. Therefore, the first-line treatment for MP pneumonia can be initially started, even in cases of MRMP pneumonia. Considering the exaggerated immune response in children with MP pneumonia [18] , the application of immunemodulators, such as corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, rather than antibiotics, might play more important roles in the management of MP pneumonia, even in some cases of MLEP or MRMP pneumonia [19] . When selecting the proper treatment strategy for MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, consideration of diverse clinical courses, including self-limiting features and combined immune responses in each case, might be more important than the results of in vitro sensitivity tests to macrolide. This study has some limitations. First, there might have been selection bias due to not including all cases of CAP in Korean children. Second, some patients might have been misclassified into the \"no MP pneumonia and no respiratory virus detection\" group due to a sampling error, including inappropriate sputum specimens or lack of repetitive follow-up of MP-specific IgM in patients with an initial negative result for MP-specific IgM. Due to the retrospective study design, all techniques of RT-PCR for detection of respiratory viruses and MP and serology for MP were not performed in all participants. In the present study, we did not include CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens; therefore, we could not identify time-dependent changes in the occurrence of CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens alone or caused by co-infection of typical bacteria and viruses. However, following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the disease burden due to bacterial pneumonia has been significantly decreased [6, 20] . Therefore, we clinically defined the MSMP, MRMP, and MLEP pneumonia groups solely based on fever duration after initiation of the administration of macrolides, regardless of the results of the in vitro tests for macrolide sensitivity. Because the results of in vitro sensitivity tests to antibiotics do not always correspond with those of in vivo sensitivity tests of the same antibiotics [21] and administration of immune-modulators might play more important roles in the treatment of MP pneumonia in some cases, the application of clinical classifications of MP pneumonia, rather than the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, might be more helpful in the management of MP pneumonia. This is especially significant in cases of MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, in this era with a high rate of antibiotic-refractory MP.",
