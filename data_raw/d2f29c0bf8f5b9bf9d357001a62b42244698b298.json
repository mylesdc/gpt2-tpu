Our previous work reported on an EV71-infected rhesus monkey infant model that presented with histo-pathologic changes of the central nervous system (CNS) and lungs. This study is focused on the correlated modulation of gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants. The expression of more than 500 functional genes associated with multiple pathways was modulated. The expression of genes associated with immune inflammatory responses was up-regulated during the period from days 4 to 10 post-infection. The expression of two genes (TAC1 and IL17A), which play major roles in inflammatory reactions, was remarkably up-regulated during the infection period. Furthermore, a higher expression level of the TAC1 gene was identified in the CNS compared to the lungs, but a high expression level of the IL-17A gene was observed in the lungs and not in the CNS. The results of this study suggest at least two facts about EV71 infection, which are that: the TAC1 gene that encodes substance P and neurokinin-A is present in both PBMCs and the hypothalamus; and the up-regulation of IL-17A is sustained in the peripheral blood.",

            "text": "Pathogenic studies focusing on hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and its emerging epidemics in the Asia-Pacific regions in recent years have demonstrated that enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major pathogens responsible for human cases of HFMD, and infection with this virus occasionally leads to severe diseases and death [1, 2] . Furthermore, multiple clinical and pathological studies focusing on the fatal cases of HFMD suggest that the brainstem encephalitis caused by EV71 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and the subsequent neurogenic heart and lung failure ultimately contribute to the severe pathogenesis in these human patients [3, 4, 5] . In this context, it is presumed that the pathogenic events observed in the CNS contributed to neurogenic heart failure or pulmonary edema; these two conditions are frequently identified as abnormal pathophysiological features triggered by the over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system [6, 7] . To date, the mechanism of this pathogenic damage process remains largely unknown. One hypothesis, based on clinical manifestations and animal experiments, is that the inflammatory response, which is characterized by a cytokine storm, is induced by EV71 infection and subsequently leads to the pathological changes in the CNS tissues, resulting in further disruption of the CNS stability [5, 8] . This hypothesis is supported by evidence that there is elevation of pro-inflammatory factors in the sera or cerebrospinal fluid of fatal cases observed in clinical manifestations and multiple animal experiments [5, 8, 9, 10] . However, whether the up-regulation of a certain type of proinflammatory factor or the abnormal expression of a specific proinflammatory factor can trigger such a pathophysiological response needs to be explored further.",

While such a pathogenic process did not result in severe neurogenic heart failure or pulmonary edema, there was remarkable alveolar inflammatory effusion and partial destruction of the alveolar wall, among other pathological changes [3, 11] .

Furthermore, similar results were noted in animal models of EV71 infection [7, 11] . Thus, we wanted to analyze the gene expression profile of the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs from EV71-infected rhesus infant. There was a clear up-regulation in the expression of more than 50 genes associated with the immune inflammatory responses during the period of 4 to 10 days p.i. (Fig. 3a) . For example, CCL13 and CCL15 both exhibited large increases in their expression levels, with CCL13 reaching a 56-fold increase on day 7 and CCL15 reaching a 42-fold increase on day 10. Additionally, the expression of interleukins, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and so on, tended to be up-regulated (Fig. 3a) .In contrast, the IFN-like pro-inflammatory cytokines failed to exhibit up-regulation, and other partial pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL8 and IL1A, were down-regulated (Fig. 3a) .",

However, the fact that the up-regulation of cytokines was asynchronous in serum and CSF suggests a predominant pathological aspect in the CNS during EV71 infection. The expression levels of 2 particular genes were interesting. The expression of the TAC1 gene, which encodes essential stress polypeptides including substance P and neurokinin A, increased as much as 36-fold on day 4 p.i. (Fig. 4a) . Additionally, the IL-17A gene has critical pro-inflammatory effects in the immune allergic reaction, and the expression of this gene increased 3.7-, 5.85-and 16.2-fold by 4, 7 and 10 days p.i., respectively (Fig. 5a) . These 2 molecules have received substantial attention due to their essential functions in the CNS stress reaction and immune system, as well as for their significance in the expression of allergic reactions in humans [29, 30, 31] .",

This gene encodes substance P and neurokinin A, which functions crucial neurotransmittors and specific neuromodulators of the immune system [32] . Both of these peptides also play significant roles in neuron-inflammatory events, including the generation of blood vessel anapetia, the increase in vascular permeability and plasma protein extravasation [33] . Importantly, substance P and its functional receptor, NK1, were found to be widely distributed in the thalamus, as well as in the neuron bodies and nerve fibers [34] . In the immune system, substance P is generated by monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages [35, 36] , and stimulates the activation of these cells, as well as increases the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines [37, 38] . Simultaneously, the up-regulation of their expression might enhance the inflammatory response. Microarray analysis of PBMCs indicated a 36-fold increase in the expression of the TAC1 gene 4 days p.i. (Fig. 4a) , and the expression was subsequently restored to its original state 7 days p.i.",

The histopathological examination and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and cerebrospinial fluid, including the so called proinflammatory cytokine storm [5, 47] , suggest an abnormal immune response [46] . It has been shown that EV71 can infect the immune cells, including monocytes or immature DCs, leading to the altered expression of individual immune mediators [48, 49] . Additionally, molecular studies have demonstrated that EV71 can inhibit the expression of IFN-like molecules in cells, which in turn impacts the innate immune response via its encoded proteins, such as 3C protein [50] . This provided the rationale for testing gene expression profiles of PBMCs in the context of our EV71 infected rhesus macaque infant model [11] using microarray technology, to better detail the immune response to this infection. We hypoth- esized that a close correlation exists between the mechanism of EV71 pathogenicity and an abnormal immune response.",

The significant functional genes associated with immune activity displayed in the gene expression profile of PBMCs in the EV71 infected animals imply that there is an integral systemic immune response. The up-regulation of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed, such as substantial increases of chemokines (CCL13, CCL13 and etc.) compared to their levels prior to infection, and this result suggesting that there is a potentially excessive immune response in the EV71 infection process.

Although these two factors seem to be functionally independent, the integration of their activities in the immune response might provide a clue for understanding the EV71 pathogenesis. Previous studies have suggested that tachykinins, including substance P and neurokinin A as the important neuropeptides, can potentiate cholinergic neurotransmission in the CNS and postganglionic nerve terminals [51, 52] . This neuropeptides was also synthesized in non-neuronal cells, such as macrophages and released in inflammatory diseases [35] . Because their receptors NK1 (for SP) and NK2 (for NKA) were located in the epithelial cells, vessels, submucosal glands and smooth muscle of respiratory system, tachykinins most likely showed a more important constricting effect on the smaller bronchi and microvascular of the bronchi and alveoli in asthmatic subjects [53, 54, 55, 56] .",

IL-17 was also capable of recruiting neutrophils to inflammatory tissue through stimulating IL-8 and MIP-2 production in epithelial cells [58] . Both factors showed activity that impacts the respiratory physiological process and most likely results in lung and bronchial disorders, which are typical pathophysiological events that are clinically observed in severe case of EV71 infection [59, 60] . In this case, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the significant up-regulations of the TAC1 and IL-17 genes might be related to EV71 pathogenesis, especially with respect to the pathological outcome induced by EV71 infection in the CNS. Interestingly, based on the up-regulation of the TAC1 gene in PBMCs, histochemical examination performed over the same time period demonstrated that the expression of substance P in the hypothalamus of EV71-infected animals was remarkably higher than in un-infected animals.",

Furthermore, the sustained up-regulation of the IL-17A gene in PBMCs during EV71 infection also suggests that IL17A, as a cytokine responsible for allergic diseases of the respiratory tract, could play an important role in the activation of the immune inflammatory effect through stimulating some of the inflammatory factors and neutrophil recruitment [58] . Similarly, as confirmed by histochemical examination and RT-PCR, the expression level of IL-17A in the lungs of EV71-infected animals exhibited a sustained increase compared with the control group. Based on the fact that IL-17A was produced by innate immune cells, the increasing expression of this gene in the lung during pathogenesis implies a positive feedback cycle in which the allergic effects could be amplified by the increased neutrophil recruitment by IL-17A, exacerbating further the increase in the secretion of IL-17A by the recruited neutrophils. Substance P can improve the production of Th17 cells by targeting the immune system [62] . Strikingly, the dynamic up-regulation of substance P in the PBMC and CNS appears to be correlated with the increase of IL-17A in the lungs, an organ damaged in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. Whether this relationship can directly lead to the elucidation of the mechanism behind the pathological changes during EV71 infection is an interesting issue worthy of further exploration.",
