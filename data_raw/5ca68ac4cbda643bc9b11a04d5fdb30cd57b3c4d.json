For this reason we followed the Expert Determination approach to manage data export.",

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued regulations that set standards for the use of patient data. Under HIPAA, laboratories that perform the BioFire \u00ae FilmArray test on patient samples are \"Covered Entities\". If laboratories send PHI to a third party (such as the IVD manufacturer) then that party is acting as a business associate (BA) of the Covered Entity and a Business Associate Agreement would be required. The HIPAA Privacy Rule [81] dictates that Covered Entities and, by extension, their BAs, may only disclose PHI with the patient's written authorization for the purposes of treatment, payment or normal health care operations, and a small number of additional exemptions [77]. Trend software resolves HIPAA concerns by removing all PHI before the test results leave the Covered Entity. This makes it highly unlikely that BioFire, or a malicious intruder into the Trend database, could associate the FilmArray test results with a patient. Because PHI is not exported,",
