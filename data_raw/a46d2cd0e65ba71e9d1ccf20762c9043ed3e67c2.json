The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. Results: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 \u00b1 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 \u00b1 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883-0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time.",

NSIP was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society consensus classification [8, 9] . Patients were not treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before undergoing a lung biopsy. Connective tissue disease (CTD) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology as follows: autoantibodies against the nucleus (ANA titer >1:320), rheumatoid factor, Sj\u00f6gren's-syndrome-related antigens SSA or SSB, Scl-70, Sm, anti-Jo-1, ribonucleoprotein, or cyclic citrullinated peptide [10] [11] [12] [13] . Patients with NSIP were classified into the groups as follows: (1) Members of the CTD-NSIP group met the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for CTD. (2) Members of the NSIP-Ab + group had at least one positive serologic test. (3) Members of the NSIP-Abgroup were autoantibody negative. We extracted clinical characteristics documented at the time of a patient's first visit as follows: age, ethnicity, sex, symptoms (cough, dyspnea, or wheeze) at the time of lung biopsy, symptoms or signs of CTD, smoking status, physical examination findings, pulmonary function results, serologic results, and chest CT scan.",

In patients with interstitial pneumonia caused by graftversus-host disease, interstitial pneumonitis develops primarily from the dissemination of perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytes infiltrates [45] . Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide suppress inflammation caused by perivascular T lymphocytes by reducing the T lymphocyte population and ameliorating T lymphocyte function [46] . These findings, taken together with those of the present study, suggest that perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of NSIP. If CD4+ T cells are involved in ILD, treating patients with anti-T cell-specific immunosuppressants such as FK506 and anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies may be justified. For example, patients with ILD, particularly those with CTD-ILD, respond to these agents, [47, 48] .",
