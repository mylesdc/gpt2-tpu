Because of the fleeting herd immunity characteristic of flu, such models typically use a deterministic compartmental disease model, in which individuals move from susceptible, to infectious, to recovered, and once again become susceptible (SIRS). For seasonal flu, which appears in the northern hemisphere every winter and virtually disappears during the summer months, the subtlety involved in modeling relates to the way seasonality is introduced, and how that seasonality may vary for different strains of the virus.

The first model (a control) assumed no differences between the 2 strains; the second allowed for different transmission rates; and the third expanded to include different background transmission and flu season length. Using STEM's automated experiment (Nelder-Mead) plug-in, 14 the project team cross-validated the models by fitting them to the historic data for a subset of the 10 years and then attempting to predict the incidence for the remaining years. Results showed the second model, which accounted for variations in transmission, increased the predictive ability for both strains, while the third model did not.",

In 3 weeks, influenza accounted for 90,000 visits to 220 health units and 20 hospitals in Mexico City. 11 The mayor's response, controversial at the time, was to implement social distancing measures, closing schools on April 24 and restaurants on April 28. All were reopened by May 11. When de-identified lab data became available, the Mexico City government collaborated with scientists at IBM Research to determine whether the actions taken had in fact limited the spread of the H1N1 virus. 15 Using the model validated in the Israeli study, the team ran repeated global simulations, with air travel, using STEM's automated experiment feature. The transmission rate was fit based on the confirmed 2009 H1N1 incidence data for Mexico City and New York (see Figure 1 ). The differential equations in the SIRS model were solved using STEM's implementation of an adaptive integration algorithm, 16 allowing the team to specify a high level of precision. Each (continued on page 297) simulation explored combinations of epidemiologic parameters, widely studied and reported elsewhere, automatically reducing the parameter step sizes until the solution approached a fit with the local minimum. The analysis determined an average reproductive number based on the values of those parameters over the 28 days between April 13 and May 10, the major epidemic wave.",

Collaborating with domain experts and scholars of avian influenza in China, the STEM team built a preliminary avian influenza model 22 In reality, the identified cases were very sporadic at eastern and northern China during the outbreak. The team built simple compartmental SIR (susceptible-infectiousrecover) models to capture the dynamics of the disease transmission between human and bird (wild and domestic) populations. The models used literature values for the avian influenza parameters published by Martcheva 23 to initialize this H7N9 model. 24 The bird-to-bird transmission coefficient was estimated to be about 8 times higher than humanto-human transmission of seasonal influenza. Birds, with a life expectancy of 2 years, shed viruses for 10 days on average; humans were infected for an average of 6 days and were expected to lose immunity over a period of 2 years.",

There are 4 similar but distinct serotypes of dengue viruses (ie, DEN 1-4). Until recently, there was no vaccine (it was under development and trial) and no specific treatment available. In the past 50 years, dengue incidence has increased 30-fold in tropical areas, 27 a concern in a time of climate change. The threat is compounded by the fact that immunity is life-long for only the strain responsible for the infection; cross immunity for the other 3 strains is partial and temporary. 28 Moreover, reinfection with a different strain carries greater risk of life-threatening complications resulting from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with increased risk of hemorrhagic fever. 26, 29, 30 To better understand the dynamics of this complex disease, scientists at IBM Research and the University of California San Francisco used STEM to test 3 models of increasing complexity. 31 The first ''host only'' model is based on work reported in the literature. 32 The second model includes the mosquito vector, and the third adds a variable defining the incubation period in humans to the compartment model. Results in all 3 models showed that cross immunity alone did not account for the dynamics (ie, 3-4 years outbreak periodicity) observed in the data reported from Thailand; 33 significant levels of antibody dependent enhancement were also required. In repeated simulations, the first model showed a high degree of chaotic behavior. The other 2 more complex models diminished this instability, suggesting that explicitly including the mosquito vector may support efforts to calibrate a model based on surveillance data and to achieve greater predictability.",

This was evident in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic that killed more than 800 people across 37 countries, the 2009 influenza H1N1 epidemic that affected more than 200 million individuals, and the 2014 Ebola outbreak that killed more than 11,000 people. [53] [54] [55] An aircraft has a role in disease spread as both a vector and an incubator. 56 An outbreak of pneumonic plague, which has a high mortality rate, is spread from person-to-person, and is endemic to the United States, may challenge the effectiveness of public health responses. 52, [57] [58] [59] To compare and contrast the spread of SARS, H1N1, and Ebola, the project extended STEM to include case fatality and infectious mortality rates based on the data of previous outbreaks, historical epidemiologic numbers, and scientific evidence. 52 The scenarios were created with the same baseline models to analyze the disease spread of each of the pathogens of interest. In order to answer the research question, ''What is the role of air travel in disease transmission as a vector for humans while carrying an infectious disease?'' disease spread was modeled with and without air travel while maintaining ground transportation. In this project, individuals arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy Figure 2 shows change in malaria incidence as a function of change in temperature. The ''susceptibility'' (or expected response) of malaria incidence is expressed in percentage change per degree centigrade. Given that there is an optimal temperature for reproduction of the anopheles mosquito, the susceptibility can be positive or negative. Thus, in different regions, depending on average temperature, the incidence may increase (red) or decrease (blue) with increasing temperature.

            "text": "Scientists at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and Hungary's National Food Chain Safety Office explored whether STEM could be used to model the ASF epidemic and evaluate potential interventions. Their efforts built on work done by Barongo and colleagues in their study of ASF in free ranging African pig herds. 73 As proof of concept, the project team at BfR re-implemented and adapted Barongo's basic and bio-intervention scenarios using STEM's model creator feature 66 and ran 1,000 simulations using STEM's batch experiments feature. 68 Their results for the base ASF model were consistent with Barongo's; those for the bio-intervention ASF models were not. 74 Further work expanded the basic ASF model with the STEM graph generator 75, 76 to simulate certain spatial characteristics of wild boar populations, including migration and mixing rates for different population subgroups. These research findings suggest that STEM can be used to DOUGLAS ET AL simulate and evaluate intervention scenarios, such as targeted hunting or fencing of wild boars in outbreak areas. While additional work based on real outbreaks and population data is required, 74 the BfR project demonstrates that STEM can be used to re-implement published models and to extend them to include new components of interest.",

In a number of risk evaluation exercises and in the preparation of a working paper for decision makers, they modified Barongo's model 73, 78 and ran STEM using geospatial data and estimates of wild boar density by area imported from the National Game Management Database at Szent Istv\u00e1n University. 79 Based on the results from these simulations, the group's report identified areas at high and medium risk and critical control points, and they proposed enforcement actions to fight the spread of ASF for evaluation by policymakers. 80 In 2018, 14 cases of ASF in wild boars reported in 1 internal region of the country (Heves county) were attributed to contaminated meat or food waste brought in by non-EU workers. Twelve new cases were identified in Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg county; the first case was found within 1 kilometer of the Ukrainian common border, suggesting natural spread (migration of wild boars) was the most likely source of infection. 80 Today, the National Food Chain Safety Office is continuing its efforts.",

STEM 4.0.0, released in early 2019, is supported by technical advances in the Equinox framework. 4 Underlying Eclipse technologies that bring complexity to the code base are compensated by Eclipse tools that automatically generate the necessary source code to create new model components/modules. Specifically, the graphical model creator/ generator 6,66 provides automatic code generation and hides much of the complexity that is inevitable in any software framework when users need to extend the available predefined model templates by adding, for example, compartments (nodes), connections (edges), or equations. Yet, the sheer number of predefined model components, the growing number of ready-to-use models, and the increasing number of software features bring a high level of complexity and the need for extensive documentation. A user new to STEM may find the array of options difficult to navigate and be challenged to determine whether a desirable feature exists and is available to use/re-use in modeling. For new and seasoned users alike, the STEM community provides web-based forums and tools to ask questions and get pointers.",

The screen shot was taken just before 100 days at epidemic peak in Queens County (lower left time series).
