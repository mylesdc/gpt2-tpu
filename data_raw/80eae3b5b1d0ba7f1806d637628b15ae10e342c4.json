These were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and transported to the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) of the Ministry of Health, also a recognized WHO National Influenza Center (NIC). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) testing was conducted to identify influenza virus types and influenza A subtypes (no influenza B subtyping was conducted) following standard procedures. 11 Initially, all samples were tested in parallel at the regional reference laboratory of the US Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3) in Cairo.

We use data from sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in Jordan to describe the activity and seasonality of influenza hospitalizations in the country. From January 2008 to February 2014, we found that influenza was detected in 9% of all patients with SARI admitted to the surveillance hospitals, although during peaks of influenza activity influenza accounted for up to 55% of SARI hospitalizations. Those with influenza were older (median, 3 years old) than those who presented with SARI and tested negative for influenza (median, 1 year old) but did not otherwise differ in demographic characteristics. Overall, 3% of the hospitalized influenza cases died and all of these deaths were among children. The system was able to detect predominant types/ subtypes of influenza during each season, including the emergence of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. Finally, the system allowed us to define the seasonality of influenza in Jordan from July through June with peaks of disease occurring in the winter months. The influenza surveillance system in Jordan appears to provide data consistent with that found in other similar surveillance systems in other parts of the world. The proportion of influenza-positive SARI cases (9%) compared well with that of similar surveillance systems in Asia (8%, 12 9% 13 ) and Africa (10%, 14 11% 15 ). In addition, the system readily detected the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic. Even in non-pandemic years the predominant influenza viruses detected in Jordan correlated with those seen in similar systems. [12] [13] [14] [15] Our data show that influenza has a substantial impact on health in Jordan. At the peak of activity, influenza accounted for an average of 34% of SARI hospitalizations, affecting people of all ages, with 16% of those with influenza reporting some chronic medical condition. Given that about one-third of SARI hospitalizations are due to influenza during the peak of a given influenza season, the availability of resources such as antiviral medications during this time could be crucial. While only eight deaths were identified, almost all of these deaths were among young children under 5 years of age. Additional work is needed to define the population burden of influenza and how that burden falls on different age groups and populations. This information will be essential to policymakers in making decisions on the costs and benefits of control strategies, such as vaccination.",

This surveillance system provides a systematic and sustainable system for monitoring influenza in Jordan, thus providing the essential data to describe and monitor influenza epidemiology in the country to inform policymaking decisions on influenza control and pandemic preparedness strategies. Developing this surveillance system has helped strengthen laboratory and epidemiologic capacity, and these capacities help Jordan in achieving compliance with International Health Regulations, 2005. 18 This system provides important data that can contribute to the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. 19 In addition, this system was developed in Jordan in parallel with regional partners as part of the multinational EMARIS Network. The goal of the EMARIS Network is to provide a forum for partner countries to share experiences and develop common methods with the goal of using future data for shared research activities. Finally, this system of surveillance sites linked to advanced laboratory capacity allowed for the rapid development of surveillance for the novel respiratory pathogen Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that has recently been described in the region. 20 Consequently, this system of SARI and influenza surveillance clearly provides a variety of important benefits both to Jordan and more broadly to regional and international partners working toward disease control and prevention.",

Our system detected hospitalized patients meeting the SARI case definition, which intrinsically limits our sample to those with more severe illness. Therefore, the results may not be indicative of milder influenza activity and trends. The ability of our system to identify cases of influenza is influenced by the sensitivity and specificity of the SARI case definition. Moreover, different case definitions were used over time, and this may have affected the sensitivity of the system over time. The consistency of our data with respect to seasonality, its comparability to other Northern Hemisphere temperate countries, and the proportion of SARI cases that are influenza positive suggest that this surveillance system is performing comparably to other SARI-based influenza surveillance systems. In addition, the high proportion of children among those with SARI and influenza observed may have been influenced by a number of factors. This may reflect societal differences in who is brought in for care. It may also reflect biases in surveillance with better case ascertainment and enrollment among children. Other SARI surveillance systems have also found high proportions of young children, [12] [13] [14] [15] so this may suggest that the SARI case definitions used might better identify pediatric symptomatology. Finally, incomplete clinical information was provided for some of our clinical variables, which may have limited our ability to examine these factors in those with influenza.
