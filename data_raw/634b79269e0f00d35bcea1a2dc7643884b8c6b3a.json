            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia, had emerged in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries within Asia, South and North America, and Europe in the spring of 2003 [1] . During this period, the SARS epidemic had been considered as a significant threat to populations as its mortality rate was approximately 10 %, responsible for around 800 deaths out of approximately 8000 patients [2] . SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel coronavirus classified as a member of the Coronaviridae family was soon identified as the causative pathogen [3, 4] . The RNA genome of SARS-CoV consists of 14 potential major open reading frames that encode the viral non-structural proteins, accesory proteins, and structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the type I integral transmembrane protein, was identified to be the functional receptor for SARS-CoV both in vitro [5, 6] and in vivo [7] . Studies on the expression of ACE2 protein and the tissue tropism and cellular distributions of SARS-CoV provided new insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis [8] . Nevertheless, certain ACE2-expressing endothelial cells and human intestinal cell lines failed to be infected by SARS-CoV [9, 10] . In contrast, cells without a detectable expression level of ACE2 such as hepatocytes could be infected by SARS-CoV [8] . In addition, the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection [8] . Altogether, these observations indicate that different virus receptors or co-receptors may be utilized in the infection of SARS-CoV in various tissues. Indeed, DC-SIGN, a c-type lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells, and a DC-SIGN-related molecule, L-SIGN (also named DC-SIGNR and CD209L) have been indicated to interact with the SARS-CoV spike protein and to facilitate the virus dissemination [11, 12] .",

Co-localization of vimentin and the SARS-CoV spike protein was observed in a short time period soon after incubation. Further studies indicate that vimentin directly binds to the SARS-CoV spike protein and is involved in the entry of SARS-CoV.

While Vero E6 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-ACE2 antibodies, those pre-treated with purified SARS-CoV spike proteins were shown to form various complexes with molecular sizes larger than 200 kDa (data not shown). This is an indication of numerous host factors associated with viral spike-ACE2 complexes upon binding. To further dissect which proteins were involved in the complexes, the reversible crosslinker DTSSP was used to link interacting partners within 12 \u00c5. Subsequently, DTSSP-linked proteins were cleaved on the central disulfide bonds of the cross-linkers by adding the reducing agent \u03b2-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. As a result, protein bands seen on the gel referred to the molecular weight of each component in the spike-ACE2 complex. By comparing the Vero E6 cell lysates pre-incubated with SARS-CoV VLPs in a time course from 10, 30, to 60 min with those treated VLPs for 0 min as a reference, seven major protein bands, named S1 to S7 (indicated by black arrowheads), showed differential abundance (Fig. 1) . The bands were then cut off the gel and sent for LC-MS/MS analysis. The resulting spectra of protein S3 demonstrated that 32 fragments were matched to a fraction of vimentin protein sequence, suggesting that a cytoskeletal protein vimentin is one of the putative ACE2-interacting proteins (inset in Fig. 1 ).",

As shown in Fig. 2 , vimentin formed complex with ACE2 in Vero E6 cells pretreated with the SARS-CoV VLPs for 10 min. Nevertheless, the interaction between vimentin and spike-ACE2 complex on the membrane is transient as co-immunoprecipitation of vimentin was no longer detected after 10 min. These results suggest an involvement of the cell surface vimentin in the virus entry via an interaction, for a relatively short time period soon after exposing to the SARS-CoV VLPs, with the spike-ACE2 complexes.

Results demonstrated a 43.4 % reduction (15.41 \u00b1 0.083 vs. 8.73 \u00b1 2.127 %) on the number of cells that uptook SARS-CoV VLPs when the cells were pre-treated with anti-vimentin antibodies, while cells pre-treated with anti-ACE2 antibodies showed a 51.6 % decline (8.86 \u00b1 1.135 vs. 4.25 \u00b1 0.541 %) (Fig. 6a) .

By using membraneinsoluble cross-linkers BS 3 and DTSSP to capture interacting proteins in close proximity (within 12 \u00c5) in the current study, vimentin was detected at 30 min after the treatment of Vero E6 cells with purified viral spike protein (Fig. 1) . The follow-up experiment demonstrated the interaction of SARS-CoV VLPs with the receptor ACE2 within 10 min of incubation (Fig. 2) . Since the structure of SARS-CoV VLPs is similar to that of SARS-CoV with a crown-shaped appearance and about 100 nm in diameter [22] , it is proposed that binding topology of the conformation-mimicking spike protein of VLPs to its ACE2 receptor is similar to the topology of SARS-CoV spike protein and requires a shorter period of time than the partially purified spike protein. Apart from the aforementioned reason, the different experimental conditions might also be playing a significant role on when vimentin proteins appear on cellular membranes since the cells treated with the purified SARS-CoV spike protein have a reacting temperature of 4\u00b0C (Fig. 1) , whereas those treated with SARS-CoV VLPs were conducted at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2) .",

Since the alveolar epithelium cells can further differentiate into type I and type II cells, both cell types are theoretical targets for SARS-CoV infections. Nevertheless, ACE2 had been proven to be largely expressed in the type II cells of the human lung [27] [28] [29] which was thus believed to be the primary target for SARS-CoV [30, 31] . This proposal was supported by another in vitro study in which human alveolar type II cells were demonstrated to be susceptible to the SARS nucleocapsid (SARS-N) protein, even though immunofluorescence staining failed to detect vimentin expression in these type II cells [32] . In the above mentioned study, infection of SARS-CoV was also detected in the primary culture of type I-like cells, where replication could not be successfully carried out. In addition, the studies on pulmonary stem/progenitor cells demonstrated their capability of differentiating into alveolar type II-and type I-like pneumocytes sequentially, both cell types were susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [33] . On the other hand, clinical and in vivo studies using macaque monkey models indicated that the target cells of SARS-CoV are primarily type I pneumocytes [34] . These studies stated above reveal that the susceptibility of either type I or type II alveolar cells to SARS-CoV infection is still controversial among different species. On top of this, the mechanism of stem/progenitor cell differentiation to the two types of alveolar cells is not yet clear. Nevertheless, our studies support the role of vimentin in the cell entry of SARS-CoV.",

This is the first observation towards the impact of vimentin on SARS-CoV cell entry, although the potential extracellular and surface-associated functions of vimentin have been reported previously in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected monocytes, where vimentin acts as a ligand for the NKp46 receptor on natural killer cells [35] . Besides, one previous study demonstrated that the tail region of surface vimentin was the endothelial target for Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) during infection [21] , supporting the hypothesis that vimentin is functionally important in the viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, the association of vimentin with the outer capsid protein VP2 was also considered essential for bluetongue virus egress [36] . One more example in African swine fever virus provided more details in the mechanism of vimentin during viral pathogenesis, suggesting that phosphorylation and rearrangement of vimentin occurred after virus infection. A vimentin cage was then subsequently formed around the virus assembly site during the later stages of infection [16] . In this research, vimentin is one of the interacting partners of the ACE2 receptor and has direct contact with SARS-CoV spike protein. Yet, which domain of vimentin plays the role of interacting with viral spike protein remains unclear. Moreover, whether vimentin binds to ACE2 directly or they only arrange in close proximity will need to be further confirmed. As mentioned, the tail region of vimentin with a unique conformation was shown to be important for CPMV entry [21] and a potential association with the membrane proteins. Hence, it is hypothesized that a putative SARS-CoV spike protein-binding domain may reside in the tail region of vimentin.",

The dashed circle indicates the spike-ACE2 complex on the cellular membrane, and the blue dotted arrow demonstrates the possible pathway when vimentin translocates from cytosol to membrane with highly positively charged amino-terminal domain and a Tyr-X-X-Y motif (where X is any amino acid, and Y is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) followed by a diacidic motif (Asp-X-Glu)-containing carboxy terminus [39] . Furthermore, phosphorylation of vimentin by several protein kinases has been identified [40, 41] . The secreted vimentin has a higher level of phosphorylation and a lower apparent molar mass than the intracellular form [13] .

Cell lysates without the process of immunoprecipitation (10 % input) were analyzed in parallel with anti-vimentin and anti-ACE2 antibodies as the protein loading controls any relatively abundant cellular proteins of 57 kDa which might interfere with far-Western blot analysis. Taken together, these data suggest an involvement of the surface vimentin in the virus entry via interacting with the spike-ACE2 complexes.",

Coomassie blue staining showed the total proteins on the gel. BSA loaded in parallel was used as a negative control entry process of SARS-CoV. In addition, since shVim-A which knocked-down vimentin expression to about 10 % had little effect on the uptake of spike protein, a low level of vimentin protein may already sufficient to facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV.",
