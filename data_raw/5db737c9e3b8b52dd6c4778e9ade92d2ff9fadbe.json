The discovery of a novel anti-influenza therapeutic approach would increase the effectiveness of traditional virus-based strategies. This study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment on influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced pneumonia in mice. Methods: Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with H1N1, then anti-HMGB1 mAb or control mAb were administered intravenously at 1, 24 and 48 hours after H1N1 inoculation and the survival rate was analyzed. Lung lavage and histopathological analysis were performed on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 after inoculation. Results: Anti-HMGB1 mAb significantly improved the survival rate of H1N1-inoculated mice (1 out of 15 versus 8 out of 15 deaths in the anti-HMGB1 mAb-treated group versus the control mAb-treated group, p < 0.01), although the treatment did not affect virus propagation in the lungs. The treatment also significantly attenuated histological changes and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of H1N1-inoculated mice. This was associated with inhibition of HMGB1 and suppression of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression and oxidative stress enhancement, which were observed in H1N1-inoculated mice. The expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products and nuclear factor \u03baB was attenuated by the treatment.",

The 2009 A (H1N1) influenza virus was a relatively mild pathogen for the majority of patients, although up to 20 % of patients developed progressive, severe H1N1-induced pneumonia requiring hospitalization [2] [3] [4] . The next influenza pandemic is predicted to arise in the near future. Tremendous advances have been made in the development of anti-influenza drugs in the last few decades [5, 6] ; however, their therapeutic effects are not guaranteed because of the need to administer these agents early after onset, and the emergence of resistant virus strains [7, 8] . Additionally, the protective effects and the production and availability of influenza vaccines are also limited [9] . This situation underlies the pressing need to define novel therapeutic targets involved in disease pathogenesis and progression.",

Shi et al. reported inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) with etanercept, an agent that provided protection against H1N1 infection in mice [11] . The inhibition of an inflammatory cytokine, therefore, represented a promising novel strategy against influenza infection. In this study, we focused on high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), originally identified as a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein [12] , which is now also recognized as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule [13] . HMGB1 has been proposed to be a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including sepsis [14] , autoimmunity [15] , acute lung inflammation [16] and several severe viral infections [17] [18] [19] . HMGB1 can be released passively from necrotic cells and/or actively secreted by macrophages or monocytes into the extracellular milieu [20] . Extracellular HMGB1 can elicit the production of proinflammatory cytokines that induce inflammatory responses through several immune receptors, including the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [21] and the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) [22, 23] . Moreover, intranuclear HMGB1 has also been reported to play a significant role in the replication of influenza viruses [24] .",

The primary structure of HMGB1 is conserved, with 99 % amino acid sequence homology between rodent and human. Therefore, the results in our study may be applicable to influenza infection in humans. Moreover, we have also developed a humanized anti-HMGB1 mAb (data not shown).

IL-6 is rapidly released during the acute phase of influenza infection and its elevated levels are associated with disease severity triggered by H1N1 infection [42] .

            "text": "Our key finding is that treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb resulted in suppressed expression of RAGE. RAGE is the primary binding receptor for HMGB1, and the interaction of RAGE and HMGB1 induces an inflammatory response via NF-\u03baB activation [13] . Van Zoelen et al. [23] previously reported the importance of RAGE in the pathogenesis of influenza-induced pneumonia. Pulmonary RAGE upregulation was associated with influenza-induced pneumonia, and RAGE-deficient mice showed increased resistance to influenza-induced pneumonia. Additionally, HMGB1-induced signaling can result in the expression of RAGE via a positive feedback loop [45] . Therefore, treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb itself could restrict RAGE expression in H1N1-induced pneumonia by blocking HMGB1-induced signaling, resulting in suppression of the inflammatory response. Interestingly, however, the attenuation of RAGE expression was seen only in the early phase of infection (day 3) in anti-HMGB1 mAb-treated mice, although HMGB1 level was suppressed significantly in both serum and BALF at all time points. Correspondingly, there was no significant difference in the expression of NF-\u03baB between the two groups in the later phase of infection (days 7 and 10). These findings help to explain the observation that few cytokines differed significantly in expression between the two groups in the later phase of infection. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) might provide a key to answer this paradox. We found in this study that the RAGE level in BALF, which should be sRAGE, was significantly higher in control mice than in anti-HMGB1 mAb-treated mice. Without a transmembrane domain, sRAGE is reported to circulate out of the cell and act as a decoy by preventing ligands, including HMGB1, from binding to RAGE, therefore functioning as a negative feedback on RAGE interactions with its ligands [46, 47] . The hyper-expression of sRAGE in BALF might result in decreased cytokine levels. Further research on the downstream signaling pathways of the HMGB1-RAGE axis in influenza-induced pneumonia is warranted to clarify these speculations.",

Therefore, it is possible that neutralization of HMGB1 may affect TLR4 expression, leading to an altered cytokine response in the lungs. TLR4-mediated HMGB1 signaling may induce deleterious effects of HMGB1. We therefore measured the levels of TLR4 expression in the lungs after anti-HMGB1 mAb treatment. As a result, neutralization of HMGB1 did not affect TLR4 expression in the lungs compared with the control (Additional file 1). Thus, it is likely that TLR4 signaling is not directly involved in the altered cytokine response and lung pathology after anti-HMGB1 mAb treatment. We believe that RAGE-mediated HMGB1 signaling is important in this model. To test this hypothesis, a specific RAGE antibody could be used or a small interfering RNA specific for RAGE could be employed. It has been shown that mice with a RAGE deficiency were protected against influenza virus infection [23] . Further studies will be necessary to address these points.",

The protective effects of anti-HMGB1 mAb might be explained by its blockade of the interaction between HMGB1 and RAGE, a key mechanism in the initiation of inflammatory and oxidative responses. These results suggest that anti-HMGB1 mAb represents a possible therapeutic pharmacological strategy for severe influenza-induced pneumonia in humans.",
