Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. Results: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels.",

The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.",

The four partial polymerase gene sequences had 92.1-97.5% nucleotide sequence identity and they were found to be closely related to the roundleaf bat hepadnavirus from Yunnan province, China, with nucleotide identities of 88.8-95.5% [9] . The full-length genomic sequence of a sample from R. sinicus (designated bat HBV Rs3364, or BtHBVRs3364) was determined and it was found to have a length of 3,272 nucleotides. The virus has an identical genomic organization to other hepadnaviruses, with four open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the surface (S), polymerase (P), core (C), and X proteins. In addition, the typical direct repeat (DR) sequences for viral genome replication and the secondary structure \u0190-loops for viral reverse transcription were present in the BtHBVRs3364 genome. A detailed comparison of the full-length genomic sequence and the ORFs of the virus with other known hepadnaviruses is shown in Table 4 . The results showed that the four genes of BtHBVRs3364 have the highest degree of identity with the roundleaf bat hepadnavirus from Yunnan province, at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels [9] . Notably, we found large differences between BtHBVRs3364 and other hepadnaviruses from the African horseshoe and roundleaf bats, the long-fingered bat from Myanmar, and the tent-making bat from Panama.",

However, these hypotheses need to be proved by screening more bat samples from across the globe for hepatitis viruses. In this study, we screened for hepatitis viruses in bats from China and discovered four novel hepadnaviruses circulating in two species of horseshoe bat in Jinning city, Yunnan province and one hepevirus in the whiskered bat M. davidii in Xianning city, Hubei province. The full-length genomic sequences of one of the two hepadnaviruses from R. sinicus and the hepevirus from M. davidii were determined. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the bat hepadnavirus found in this study is closely related to roundleaf bat hepadnaviruses, which were discovered in Pu'er city, Yunnan province in 2011 [9] , but shows remarkable divergence when compared to the African horseshoe bat, despite the fact that it was found in an Asian horseshoe bat. A similar phylogenetic relationship was found between hepadnaviruses from the African roundleaf bat and the African horseshoe bat [6] , indicating the separate evolution of these viruses and their hosts.",

According to the latest proposal of the ICTV in 2016, amino acid distances of concatenated ORF1 and ORF2 (lacking hypervariable regions) greater than 0.088 could then act as threshold to demarcate intra-and inter-genotype distances [15] . The hepevirus detected in the whiskered bat, M. davidii, and that found in the German serotine bat, E. serotinus (the only reported bat hepevirus with a full-length genome) shared significant diversity from both nucleotide and amino acid levels, we propose that they can be grouped into the species Orthohepevirus D which is divided into two genotypes: D1 and D2. Our results provide further evidence to support the theory regarding the long-term co-evolution of hepadnaviruses and hepeviruses with their hosts, and the theory that bats act as major natural reservoirs for these hepatitis viruses. Our results have limitations due to the small sample size used, which was a result of the protection of bat populations in China, as bats play important roles in the pollination of plants and in pest control, as they feed on insects. However, based on our discovery of hepatitis viruses in bats, it is expected that there are many more hepatitis viruses circulating in numerous bat species and in various geographic regions. In order to obtain larger sample sizes, non-invasive methods of virus detection should be considered for future studies. ",
