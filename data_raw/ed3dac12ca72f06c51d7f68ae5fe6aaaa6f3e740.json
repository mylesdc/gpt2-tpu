The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of cytokines in AECOPD. Patients with AECOPD requiring hospitalization were recruited. Meanwhile healthy volunteers of similar age that accepted routine check-ups and showed no clinical symptoms of inflammatory diseases were also recruited. Induced sputum and serum were collected. Induced sputum of participants was processed and tested for thirteen viruses and bacteria. Forty cytokines were assayed in serum using the Quantibody Human Inflammation Array 3 (Ray Biotech, Inc.). The most common virus detected in virus positive AECOPD (VP) was influenza A (16%). No virus was found in controls. Circulating levels of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 were elevated in VP and coinfection subjects ( < 0.05), while the levels of 37 other cytokines showed no difference, compared with virus negative groups and controls ( > 0.05). Additionally, VP patients were less likely to have received influenza vaccination. VP patients had a systemic inflammation response involving IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 which may be due to virus-induced activation of macrophages. There are important opportunities for further investigating AECOPD mechanisms and for the development of better strategies in the management and prevention of virus-related AECOPD.",

AECOPD leads to significant morbidity and is among the major causes of death worldwide [2] and results in heavy societal and economic burden. Viral infection has been confirmed as a cause of AECOPD and considered a major cause of AECOPD hospitalizations [3] . Viral detection may be influenced by the viral detection methodology and the sample that is used for assay. In several previous studies conducted with conventional methods (including viral culture and serology), the incidence of viral identification was underestimated when compared to molecular diagnostic methods [4] [5] [6] [7] . With the development of molecular diagnostics, the detection of respiratory viruses in AECOPD is both easier and more accurate. Induced sputum that is obtained from the lower respiratory tract 2 Journal of Immunology Research has relatively higher virus-detection rate when compared to samples from the upper respiratory tract [3] .",

AECOPD was defined with at least two major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, enhanced cough, or increased sputum production) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore throat, and cough) for at least 2 consecutive days [13, 14] . Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, renal failure, cancer, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, asthma, antivirus treatment, or currently active tuberculosis were excluded. In addition, COPD patients who were unconscious or declined to participate were also excluded. Meanwhile 12 healthy, neversmoking, nonatopic, similar-aged volunteers with no history of respiratory disease underwent sputum induction and lung function assessment. All of them accepted routine check-ups and showed no clinical symptoms of inflammatory diseases. Induced sputum and serum were collected and the following basic clinical characteristics were recorded and assessed: age, gender, smoking history, and lung function (GOLD levels). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to the recruitment and this study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Jilin Provincial People's Hospital (approval number: 201405).",

Cohorts with higher vaccine coverage for influenza have been found to have a lower prevalence of influenza [18, 19] , which is supported by our comparison of VN versus VP. Moreover, population with low influenza vaccine coverage had higher influenza detection rates, and none of the influenza-positive patients received vaccination in the previous year [20] . Considering the extremely low influenza vaccination coverage (1.9% of the total population) in China and the factor that influenza-positive rate is higher in adults and elderly [21] , attention should be paid to the rapidly aging country to effectively control influenza A infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm the exact reasons for the variance in viral distribution and viral detection rates between our findings and other studies. We also note the odd phenomenon that RSV was not found in viral AECOPD in our study all the year round. In a study conducted from January to June 2014 in China, despite low rate, three cases of RSV infections were found in nasopharyngeal samples of 81 participants admitted for AECOPD [22] , which was inconsistent with our finding. Furthermore, RSV is an important cause of viral infections in lower respiratory tract in elderly and high-risk adults [23] and is ranked as one of the most prevalent viruses in a total of 1728 AECOPD subjects in nineteen studies in a systematic review [24] . The reason why RSV was not observed in our investigation remains elusive and needs further studies.",

            "text": "The profiling of 40 inflammatory markers was conducted to assess the association between viral infection and host cytokine responses in AECOPD. In previous studies the major objective of detection was to investigate the types of microorganisms involved in AECOPD, and less emphasis was placed on proinflammatory cytokines. We found that patients with viral infections showed higher levels of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 than those without (Figure 3 ). Patients with a coinfection by virus + bacteria also exhibited higher levels of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 than those with negative microbiology results. Furthermore, the expression of these markers showed no difference between VN and HC ( > 0.05), indicating that the difference of marker expression might be caused by viral infection. IL-6 is a pleiotropic acute-phase cytokine involved in the host immune response to infection, reflecting the severity of lower airway inflammation [27, 28] . Higher levels of IL-6 are associated with the exacerbations of COPD and increase the predictive accuracy of viral infection when combined with the clinical diagnosis [26, 29] . TNF-is a mononuclear-phagocyte-origin cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on innate host responses to microbes [30] and it recruits inflammatory cells into the site of infection [31] and is overexpressed in AECOPD [32] . MCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant that contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the site of infection [33, 34] . Higher levels of MCP-1 have been reported in patients with virus-induced respiratory illness [35, 36] . There is increasing evidence that macrophages orchestrate the inflammatory responses of COPD through the release of chemoattractant and proteases [37] . Higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-may be associated with the activation of macrophages. Influenza virus, which was the most common virus in our study, induces the activation of macrophages via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [38] . Yageta et al. [39] found that isolated murine macrophages were activated by costimulation of cigarette smoke extract and influenza A virus. In response to influenza A virus-infection, macrophages produce large amount of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 [40] [41] [42] [43] . Tissue macrophages are the key cell types responsible for the production of antiviral and immunoreactive cytokines [44] . Taken together, we conclude that higher levels of those inflammatory markers might be induced by viral inflammation and activation of macrophages, which might provide support for further investigation in the pathogenesis of viral AECOPD in Asia.",

Future work can define the clinical and treatment implications of these result, and lay the basis for further investigating the role of immune system in the pathogenesis and development of AECOPD.",
