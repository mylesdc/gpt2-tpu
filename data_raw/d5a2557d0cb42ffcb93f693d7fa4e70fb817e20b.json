            "text": "MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTEH) antibody in development for the treatment of patients with cancers expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326-349 and 388-410, with critical residues F 326 , T 328 , N 333 , V 388 , G 389 , P 390 , E 392 , I 408 , and N 410 . Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBankH database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.",

Cancer cells not only lose polarized (luminal) expression of CEA, but actively cleave CEA from their surface by phospholipases, an action that results in serum concentrations of CEA that can approach 5 mg/mL [3, 4, 5] . Serum CEA levels may be monitored to detect a response to anticancer therapy, or disease recurrence in colorectal cancer [6] , and serves as a prognostic indicator in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, where elevated levels indicate a poor prognosis and correlate with reduced overall survival [7, 8, 9] .",

            "text": "As a novel CEA-directed therapy, we have developed a CEAtargeting bispecific single-chain antibody of the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) class termed MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) [16, 17, 18] . BiTE antibodies are a unique subclass of bispecific antibodies that contain one single chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for a tumor associated antigen molecularly fused to another scFv with specificity for CD3 on T cells [19] . Highly potent and specific tumor cell lysis is triggered only when BiTE antibodies bind both epitopes simultaneously, resulting in directing T cells to the tumor cells and activating the T cell through the CD3/T cell receptor (TCR) complex [20] . Notably, activation of T cells is independent of TCR specificity, peptide antigen presentation, and co-stimulatory signals [21] . As a result of T cell activation, granzymes and perforin are mobilized to the tumor cell-T cell interface and mediate an apoptotic killing of target cells; FAS ligand expression may also contribute to the induction of apoptosis through engagement of FAS on tumor cells [22, 23, 24] . BiTE antibodies activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets [23, 25, 26, 27, 28] ; both subsets of T cells contribute to tumor cell killing at relatively low effector T cell:target tumor cell (E:T) ratios [22, 29] . Cytokine secretion and the upregulation of cell surface IL-2 receptor by T cells (measured experimentally using antibodies recognizing the IL-2Ra chain/CD25) occur simultaneously and accompany tumor cell killing [18, 22, 25] . Both potentiate further T cell activation and proliferation, facilitating the subsequent engagement and killing of additional tumor cells bound by a BiTE antibody. BiTE antibodies not only induce the potent lysis of human cancer cell lines in vitro, but have also been shown to mediate the killing of primary human tumor cells by cancer patient T cells ex vivo [17, 25, 30] . Furthermore, BiTE antibodies promote in vivo tumor regression in numerous pre-clinical animal models [16, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and have shown signs of clinical benefit in patients with cancer [37, 38, 39] .",

It specifically binds to CEA and not to other CEACAM family members [16] . Upon concurrent binding to CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, MEDI-565 mediates T cell activation and the subsequent killing of CEA-expressing target cells in a perforin-and granzyme-dependent manner that is insensitive to concentrations up to 5 mg/mL of soluble CEA [16, 17, 18] . Furthermore, intravenous and subcutaneous administration of MEDI-565 had anticancer activity in severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models of various human cancers [18] ; growth inhibition of the cancers was contingent on both the presence of un-stimulated human T cells and the expression of CEA on the cancer cells [18] . MEDI-565 is currently in phase I clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01284231) for the treatment of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.",

Five deletion mutants were constructed by removing the following IgC-like domains: A1, B1 and A2 domains (DelA1-A2), A1 domain (DelA1), B1 domain (DelB1), A2 domain (DelA2), and B2 and A3 domains (DelB2-A3) as shown in Figure 3A . The mutants were transiently expressed as GPI-anchored proteins on HEK293 F cells. The binding of MEDI-565 or the anti-CEA polyclonal control antibody to each of the deletion mutants was analyzed using flow cytometry. MEDI-565 did not recognize any of the deletion mutants which lack the A2 domain (DelA1-A2 and DelA2, Figure 3B ), but bound well to all mutants that contained it (DelA1, DelB1 and DelB2-A3, Figure 3B ). Additionally, when all but the A2 IgC-like domains were removed (A2; Figure 4B ), MEDI-565 still recognized the corresponding truncated CEA protein at a level similar to that measured for full-length CEA protein ( Figure 4C ). These results suggested that the epitope of MEDI-565 is localized in the A2 domain of CEA.",

Two truncated CEA mutants (A2 and A3) were engineered and used as templates for the construction of swap mutants. The A2 or A3 mutant is comprised of the N-domain, the A2 or A3 domain, and the GPI region. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of the A2 and A3 domains identified differences in their aa composition. These regions of sequence diversity were divided into three shorter segments labeled as A (aa 326 to 349), B (aa 360 to 382) and C (aa 388 to 410) ( Figure 4A ). Six swap mutants were generated by swapping segments A, B or C of the A3 domain into the A2 domain (KO mutants), or by swapping segments of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI mutants) as shown in Figure 4B . MEDI-565 did not bind to any of the KO or KI mutants lacking either the A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A, KO_C, KI_A, KI_B and KI_C, Figure 4B , C), but bound well to the swap variant which encoded both the A and C segments of the A2 domain (KO_B, Figure 4B , C). Some residual binding of MEDI-565 to the KO_C mutant could be detected. Together with . Swap-mutants of human CEA. A, amino acid sequence alignment of the A2 and A3 domains of CEA. Sequence homology analysis revealed 21 amino acids that differed between these two domains (amino acids boxed). Three segments, A, B, and C, were defined in the A2 and A3 domains to generate swap-mutants. B, a schematic display of swap mutants that were constructed by exchanging segments A, B, or C between the A2 (open boxes) and A3 (grey boxes) domains using the truncated mutant A2 or A3 as a template which encodes the N-domain, the A2 or A3 domain, and the GPI region. C, flow cytometry analysis of binding of MEDI-565 to deletion mutants expressed on the surface of HEK293 F cells. All mutants were expressed well as monitored by anti-CEA polyclonal antibody. MEDI-565 did not bind well to any of the knock-out (KO) or knock-in (KI) mutants which lack either the A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A, KO_C, KI_A, KI_B and KI_C), but bound well to the one variant which encoded both the A and C segments of the A2 domain (KO_B). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036412.g004 MEDI-565 lack of binding to KO_A mutant, this data indicated that segment C significantly contributed to MEDI-565 binding, but to a lesser degree than segment A. Due to the high degree of identity between segment B in the A2 and the A3 domains, direct involvement of this segment in MEDI-565 binding could not be entirely ruled out using a swap mutant-based approach. It is however unlikely for the following reasons 1) MEDI-565 did not bind to the mutants encoding the B segment of A2 domain in conjunction with either A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A or KO_C, Figure 4 ); 2) The binding level of MEDI-565 to the mutant encoding both the A and the C segments of A2 domain (KO_B) was comparable to the signal of both the full-length CEA and the A2 deletion mutant (Figure 4) ; and 3) The modeled structure of the A2 domain using murine CEACAM1 as a template revealed that segment B was spatially distal from critical residue N 333 (see following section). Therefore, the swap-mutants revealed that MEDI-565 bound to a nonlinear epitope in the A2 domain of CEA, which is comprised of two segments, namely 326-349 (segment A) and 388-410 (segment C).",

The amino acids of segments A and C of the A2 domain that differed from the A3 domains were replaced with the corresponding A3 residues encoding several substitutions at a time: Figure 4A ). The binding of MEDI-565 was substantially decreased to the variants in which residue N 333 was mutated (KO_FTN and KO_NE), but bound well to the other mutants ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, replacing only residue N 333 with either its counterpart residue Lys in the A3 domain (KO_N) or with Ala (N 333 to A) abolished MEDI-565 binding ( Figure 5C ). Mutating the residue F 326 or T 328 to Ala substantially decreased the binding of MEDI-565 (F 326 to A, T 328 to A), suggesting that they were also involved in the interaction with MEDI-565 but to a lesser extent than residue N 333 ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, our data demonstrated the importance of F 326 , T 328 , and N 333 . Finally, since E 338 is encoded in the KO_ELI variant which binds well to MEDI-565, we concluded that this residue is not energetically involved in MEDI-565 epitope. We had previously noted that grafting only segment A that includes the F 326 , T 328 , and N 333 residues of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI_A) did not result in MEDI-565 binding. This suggested that MEDI-565 binding epitope comprises additional critical residues and pointed towards it being nonlinear and conformational.",

            "text": "It is possible that some knock-out CEA variants exhibited an incorrect fold in or near the MEDI-565 epitope region, thereby losing their binding capacity. Therefore, we further confirmed the potential epitope regions identified with knock-out variants by using gain of function (knock-in) mutants. Indeed, ''knocking in'' segments A (326-349) and C (388-410) of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KO_B/KI_A+C, KO_B encodes the same amino acids as KI_A+C) resulted in MEDI-565 binding comparable to full length CEA ( Figure 4C, 5C) . Furthermore, only grafting the three amino acids F 326 T 328 N 333 of segment A with the six amino acids V 388 G 389 P 390 E 392 and I 408 N 410 of segment C into the A3 domain (KI_FTN+VGPE+IN) also resulted in MEDI-565 binding comparable to full length CEA ( Figure 5C ). In summary, these results demonstrate that the epitope of CEA bound by MEDI-565 is a nonlinear, conformational epitope located in the A2 domain of CEA; it is comprised of two segments of amino acids 326 to 349 and 388 to 410 with critical amino acids F 326 , T 328 , N 333 , V 388 , G 389 , P 390 , E 392 , I 408 , and N 410 . The residue N 333 may contribute more to the binding of MEDI-565, since mutating it alone completely disrupted the interaction ( Figure 5C ).",

The minor allele homozygosity rate for rs7249230 was from 0 to 0.068 in different populations.

Due to its concordant expression with full length CEA in human tumors, we sought to understand the binding of MEDI-565 to the CEA splice variant and the role that this CEA isoform might play in targeting CEApositive tumors. The amino acids in full-length CEA important for MEDI-565 binding were found to be largely absent in the CEA splice variant, except amino acids I 408 and N 410 in segment C ( Figure 2 ). This observation suggested that binding of MEDI-565 to the CEA splice variant was unlikely to occur. To test this hypothesis, CHO cells were infected with lentivirus constructs directing the expression of full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA) or the CEA splice variant (CHO SV CEA), or both concurrently after sequential infection of cells with the CEA splice variant then the full-length CEA (CHO FL+SV CEA); full-length CEA and CEA splice variant protein expression were verified by western blotting ( Figure S1 ). As anticipated, MEDI-565 bound to cells expressing full-length CEA but not to cells expressing the CEA splice variant ( Figure 6A ). We note that a higher level of MEDI-565 binding was observed for cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full length CEA together relative to cells expressing only full length CEA. This is likely due to different levels of expression efficiency in each independently infected cell line, although effects of the CEA splice variant protein on full length CEA protein levels or epitope accessibility in cells cannot be ruled out.",

Co-expression of the CEA splice variant with full-length CEA on the same cells did not significantly affect the apparent binding affinity of MEDI-565 to full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA, apparent K D = 5.060.15 nM; CHO FL+SV CEA, apparent K D = 5.663.0 nM; p = 0.86).

The most extensive investigations involve the classification of 52 anti-CEA mAbs into five distinct epitopes, Gold epitopes 1-5, by competitive binding analysis [50] . Further studies have correlated the Gold epitopes to the domains of CEA using different CEA fragment constructs [51, 53, 54] , however there is no precise localization of the epitopes to the amino acid sequence level. An attempt to identify the amino acid sequences corresponding to Gold epitopes using synthetic overlapping fifteen-mer peptides has failed [55] , suggesting that the Gold epitopes are conformational. In addition, immunohistochemistry and immuno flow cytometry were used to demonstrate a good correlation between the Gold epitope groups and their binding specificity: 1) mAbs that bind to Gold epitopes 2 and 3 were generally specific to CEA, reacting only with colon carcinoma, normal colon mucosa and normal gastric foveola; 2) mAbs in epitopes 4 and 5 were highly cross-reactive with different normal tissues possibly due to binding to CEA-related antigens; and 3) both specific and cross-reactive mAbs were found in epitope 1 [56] . We have mapped the epitope of the CEA-specific arm of MEDI-565 to the A2 domain comprised of two stretches of amino acids, 326-349 and 388-410. Interestingly, the MEDI-565 epitope on CEA belongs to the Gold epitope 2, which has been localized in the A2-B2 domains [53] and identified as a CEA-specific epitope group [56] .",

The anti-CEA arm of MEDI-565 is a humanized version of the murine antibody A5B7, which has been shown to specifically bind to CEA [40, 56] . Characterizing the epitope of MEDI-565 has led us to propose that the critical residues F 326 , T 328 , and N 333 mediate the fine specificity to CEA of MEDI-565 due to their uniqueness in the A2 domain of CEA when compared with all other immunoglobulin domains of CEA and other related molecules of the CEACAM family, including CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM4, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8.",

Two nonsynonymous SNPs were identified in the binding epitope of MEDI-565 but occurred at a very low frequency in the general population and were considered to have little or no impact on MEDI-565 binding to CEA. In addition, a single splice variant was identified lacking a portion of the A2 domain critical for MEDI-565 binding. Efforts to understand the association of splice variant expression to disease found that its expression occurred in a substantial percentage of primary human colorectal and gastro-esophageal tumors, and to a lesser extent in lung and breast tumors in a pattern that was concordant with full length CEA expression. However, since MEDI-565 did not bind the CEA splice variant due to loss of the antibody-binding epitope, it was clear that the splice variant itself is not a target for MEDI-565 in primary human tumors that also express full length CEA. Because CEA could participate in homotypic interactions on adjacent cells, it remained possible that expression of the CEA splice variant may interfere with the binding of MEDI-565 and the subsequent tumor cell lysis through its interaction with full length CEA. By coexpressing the CEA splice variant with full length CEA, we formally demonstrated that this was not the case, as MEDI-565 binding to full length CEA and potency of CEA-directed lysis were not significantly affected by simultaneous expression of the splice variant and full length CEA. Therefore, the expression of the CEA splice variant by primary human tumor cells is not anticipated to interfere with MEDI-565 binding to full-length CEA, nor should it inhibit MEDI-565-mediated T-cell killing of tumor cells expressing full-length CEA. However, discrimination of full-length CEA from the CEA splice variant may be important while monitoring the status of CEA positive tumors via changes in serum CEA levels in clinical study patients that receive MEDI-565.

The full-length CEA protein is indicated by a filled arrowhead, and the CEA splice variant by an open arrowhead; both proteins were detected using a CEACAM5-specific mAb.

The full-length CEA transcript (NCBI accession number NM002483) consists of 10 exons and 9 introns as shown schematically. The transcript corresponding to the CEA splice variant (NCBI accession number CR749337) removes exons 3 and 4 and a portion of exon 2 to create an alternative splice variant CEA transcript with 8 exons and 7 introns. Boxes indicate exons and lines indicate introns (not drawn to scale). B, protein domain structure of the translated full-length and splice variant transcripts of CEA. The mature full-length CEA is composed of one N-terminal domain and six IgC-like domains denoted A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, and B3. The gray bar represents the GPI linkage of the proteins to the plasma membrane shown as two parallel vertical black lines. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036412.g001 Antibody Binding Assays For binding studies with MEDI-565, Control BiTE (bispecific single-chain antibody specific for the herbicide mecoprop and human CD3; also known as MEC14 BiTE), anti-CEACAM5 mAb clone 26/13/3 (Genovac), or control mouse IgG1 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) were used. The antibodies were incubated with CHO cells at a concentration of 10 mg/mL diluted in PBS/2% FBS for 20 minutes at 4uC. For the detection of bound MEDI-565 and Control BiTE, the CHO cells were washed three times with PBS/ 2% FBS and incubated with 4 mg/mL of an AlexaFluorH 488conjugated anti-penta-His antibody (Qiagen) in PBS/2% FBS for 15 minutes at 4uC in the dark. For the detection of bound anti-CEACAM5 and control IgG mAbs, CHO cells were washed three times with PBS/2% FBS and incubated with 10 mg/mL of an Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) in PBS/2% FBS for 15 minutes at 4uC in the dark. All CHO cells were washed one time with PBS/2% FBS, resuspended in PBS/ 2% FBS containing 10 mg/mL of PI and the fluorescence intensities of bound secondary antibodies were detected by flow cytometry using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences); the data were analyzed using FlowJo Software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). Viable CHO cells (PI negative) were examined for the fluorescence intensities of bound secondary antibodies. Non-linear regression analyses employing one-site saturation binding models using mean fluorescent intensity values of antibody binding to CEA-expressing cells were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA.) to determine apparent equilibrium binding constants (apparent K D values) of MEDI-565 binding to CEA.",

Human CD3+ T cells were enriched from heparinized whole blood PBMCs of healthy donors by the RosetteSepH human T-cell enrichment cocktail (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and RosetteSep T-cell density medium (Stem Cell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. CHO DHFR-, CHO FL CEA, CHO SV CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA cells were used as target cells, and labeled with 3,39-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) cell labelling solution (Invitrogen) to distinguish them from effector T cells during flow cytometry analysis. Enriched CD3positive T cells and DiO-labeled CHO cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and 4.5 g/ L glucose. Serial dilutions of MEDI-565 or Control BiTE(containing an scFv recognizing the herbicide mecoprop in place of the CEA-binding scFv) were added to target and effector cells in 96-well non-tissue culture treated plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1. The co-cultures were incubated at 37uC in a humidified tissue culture chamber with an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 for 48 hours. Cytotoxicity, defined as a loss of cell membrane integrity, was monitored by cellular uptake of Propidium Iodide (PI); live cells exclude PI while dead cells do not. An LSRII flow cytometer using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) was used to collect data and FlowJo software (Treestar) was used to analyze the data. Cytotoxicity (specific lysis) was calculated as the percentage of all DiO-labeled target cells identified as nonviable in each well, minus background values calculated from wells containing target cells and T cells without MEDI-565. Non-linear regression analyses using a four-parameter fit were performed with GraphPad Prism software version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software) to generate sigmoidal doseresponse curves and determine calculated half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50 ) values. Sigmoidal dose response curves typically had R 2 values .0.90, and EC 50 values were used for comparison of bioactivity. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were subdivided using a PECy7-conjugated mouse anti-human CD8 mAb and a V450-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 mAb (BD Biosciences). T-cell activation (CD25 up-regulation) was monitored by the allophycoerytherin (APC)-conjugated mouse antihuman CD25 mAb (Becton Dickinson Biosciences).",

B, a modeled structure of the A2 domain of CEA revealed two clusters of amino acids (V 388 G 389 P 390 E 392 and I 408 N 410 ) in segment C (green) that were spatially close to the critical aa N333 (red) in segment A (yellow), while segment B (cyan) was distal to aa N333. C, binding characteristics of MEDI-565 to CEA mutants with single or combinatorial mutations. Replacing N 333 with Lys (KO_N) or Ala (N 333 to A) disrupted the binding of MEDI-565 to the A2 domain. Mutating F 326 or T 328 to Ala reduced the binding of MEDI-565 (F 326 to A, T 328 to A). Knocking-out the amino acids V 388 G 389 P 390 E 392 and I 408 N 410 together from the A2 domain also reduced MEDI-565 binding (KO_VGPE+IN).
