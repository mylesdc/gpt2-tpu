A study conducted at Children Hospital 2 (one of the three study hospitals) investigating viral 299 pathogens associated with ARIs found that the peak of RSV infections occurred in rainy season November in HCMC). This period includes the peak of LRI months and the stronger peak of URIs [10] . 301 Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts to bacterial infection [26] . Therefore, RSV 302 is likely to be an important pathogen with respect to seasonality and the peaks of URIs and LRIs in this 303 location. As a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the 304 incidence of later hospitalization due to LRI. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRI are around 305 September-October, resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities 306 Our study has limitations as it was derived from routine electronic hospital databases. First, it might not 310 be generalizable for all outpatients, especially for URIs, as many of patients with URI may not be 311 admitted to hospital. The findings for LRIs may be more generalizable as LRIs are more severe than URIs 312 and more likely to be hospitalized. Second, the databases contained limited information with general 313 ICD10 codes and no specific diagnostic information regarding the infecting pathogens. Different 314 pathogens may cause differing URI and LRI disease presentation and different pathogens may be 315 influenced differently by climatic, environmental, population factors as well as host immunity. Therefore, 316 prospective studies investigating different groups of pathogens for ARIs are necessary. 317 318",

This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing etiological 115 agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies, and host immunity. There are data to suggest that the incidence of ARIs is associated with specific spatial, meteorological, 127 and socio-demographic risk factors [13] [14] [15] [16] .

The association of URI incidence with one and three week lags of weekly 320 average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and 321 influenza-like illness (ILI) in Vietnam as previously reported [27] . In addition, the national surveillance of 322 influenza and ILI in Vietnam during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks 323 a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data [28] . The exceptional 324 high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 325 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs 326 in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of 327 RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May-November in HCMC). This period included the peak of 328 LRI months and the larger URI peak [10] . Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts 329 to bacterial infections [29] . In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the 330 peak of URIs (May-June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As 331 a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of 332 later hospitalization due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRIs are in September-October, 333 resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to 334 share the increase in hospitalization caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period. 335 336 We found that ARIs accounted for one third of total hospital admission and were the leading cause of 356 hospitalization in children in HCMC, Vietnam. The spatial distribution of hospitalized ARIs was similar 357 to the spatial referral patterns of the study hospitals with high incidences in the districts surrounding the 358 locations of the three study hospitals and also in three districts further out the city. The seasonality of 359 ARIs may be explained by the association of ARI incidence with various climatic factors (temperature, 360 humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of influenza, ILI, and RSV. The increase of LRI incidence soon 361 after the peak of URIs suggests that URIs and LRIs share common epidemiological factors or LRIs are 362 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \u2022 Pediatric ARI admissions were mapped and compared with all other pediatric admissions to 84 assess the spatial distribution of ARI admissions in comparison with the spatial referral pattern of 85 the study hospitals. 86",

In industrializing regions, ARIs in children aged <5 years are generally more 113 severe than in older children and adults, resulting in a higher case-fatality than in industrialized 114 countries [1, 7] . This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing etiological 115 agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies, and host immunity. The variance of raw ward ARI incidence rates (number of ARI cases per 1,000 ward total population for 182 the whole study period) may largely vary due to the large variation in ward population size in HCMC. To 183 take into account the spatial heterogeneity of variance and any dependence of ARI incidence rates 184 between wards, ward ARI incidence rates were smoothed using local empirical Bayes estimates for rates 185 reduced to a neighborhood mean [19] . The neighborhoods were selected using the neighborhood list 186 8-7 [23,24] . The seasonal cycles and time trends 198 of weekly ARI incidence were evaluated by the basic GAMM models containing the week of year (Ws=1 199 to 52)) as cyclic cubic regression splines and the week of the whole study period (Wt=1 to 312)) as cubic 200 regression spline. As weekly ARI incidence may be associated with the ARI incidence and climatic 201 condition of the previous weeks, in addition to the elements in the basic model, the full GAMM model 202 contained lags of ARI weekly incidence up to eight weeks, concurrent climatic condition and lags of 203 climatic condition up to 8 weeks. The performance of the GAMM models was evaluated using adjusted 204 R-squared and model diagnostic plots. Temporal correlation of the model residuals was evaluated by 205 autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). 206 The proportion of males (62%) and females (38%) was comparable between URIs and LRIs. The median 217 age of the patients was 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.7-2.9 years). However, patients with LRIs 218 were significantly younger than those with URIs (median age in years (IQR) = 1.1 (0.5, 2.1) vs. 2.1 (1.1, 219 3.9)), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) and LRI patients were hospitalized significantly longer than those with 220 URIs (median days of hospitalization (IQR) = 6.0 (4.0, 9.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0, 5.0), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) 221 (Table 1) . 222 223 Overall, the most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARIs), pneumonia (21% of all 224 ARIs), bronchitis (18% of all ARIs) and bronchiolitis (16% of all ARIs). Among the URI patients, the 225 majority of patients were diagnosed with acute pharyngitis (63% of all URIs), acute upper respiratory 226 infections of multiple and unspecified sites (14%), acute tonsillitis (8%), acute laryngitis and tracheitis 227 (6%), and acute nasopharyngitis (6%). Among the LRI patients, the most common diagnoses were 228 pneumonia with an unspecified organism (37% of all LRIs), acute bronchitis (32%), acute bronchiolitis 229 (29%), and bacterial pneumonia not elsewhere classified (2%) ( (14.7, 23.7) ). High incidence rates (>30 cases/1,000 population) of ARI were observed not only in 237 the wards surrounding the three study hospitals (wards in districts 1 and 4 in central HCMC) but also in 238 multiple wards located outside the central region of the city, specifically wards located in districts 2, 7, 239 and Nha Be (observed vs. expected incidence rate ratio >1.4, p<0.0001 using Kulldorff and Nagarwalla's 240 scan) (Figure 1a) . Notably, the spatial distribution of ARIs and diseases other than ARI were comparable 241 ( Figure 1a and 1b) . We observed an increase with time in ward incidence of ARIs in the majority of the 242 wards with the most apparent high incidences in wards in the south of the city ( Figure S1 ). We 243 additionally found the spatial distribution of URIs and LRIs were comparable ( Figure S2 ). 244",

The association of URI incidence with one and three week lags of weekly 321 average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and 322 influenza-like illness (ILI) in Vietnam as previously reported [27] . In addition, the national surveillance of 323 influenza and ILI in Vietnam during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks 324 a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data [28] . The exceptional 325 high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 326 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs 327 in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of 328 RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May-November in HCMC). This period included the peak of 329 LRI months and the larger URI peak [10] . Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts 330 to bacterial infections [29] . In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the 331 peak of URIs (May-June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As 332 a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of 333 later hospitalization due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRIs are in September-October, 334 resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to 335 share the increase in hospitalization caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period. 336 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 A large proportion of ARI admissions in these data were URIs, two third of these were diagnosed with 338 acute pharyngitis. These conditions can usually be treated in outpatient settings and do not typically 339 require hospitalization. However, the decision to hospitalize ARI patients in these tertiary hospitals is not 340 strictly based on the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines and is also 341 dependent on the preferences of caregivers and the subjective patient evaluation of the attending 342 physicians. Therefore, there should stricter policies for applying IMCI guidelines and other clinical 343 criteria to reduce unnecessary URI admissions in these hospitals, as well as to improving outpatient care 344 and follow up. 345",

Data from the two children 138 hospitals were collected between 2005 and 2010 (inclusive) while the data from HTD were available caused by a range of differing pathogens and may have different spatiotemporal patterns and 142 associations with climate and other covariates. Therefore, we allocated respiratory infections into two 143 major clinically differentiable groups based on the International Classification of Disease version 10 144 (ICD10) codes version 2016 outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO): 1) URIs were 145 amalgamated under the ICD10 codes J00:J06 and J9:J11 for influenza like illnesses and other acute upper 146 respiratory infections and 2) LRIs, which incorporated the ICD10 codes J12:J18 and J20:J22 for 147 pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory infections. For the purposes of this study the data from 148patients with the selected ICD10 codes who resided in HCMC were extracted and analyzed. Each patient 149 record included data regarding age, sex, date of admission and discharge, ICD10 code at discharge, districts receive mostly adult outpatients. There are two central hospitals (CH1 and CH2) that 159 specialize in serving the pediatric population in HCMC. Another further central hospital (HTD) 160 specializes in infectious diseases and also receives pediatric patients. While pediatric outpatients in 161 HCMC may choose to visit local or private healthcare facilities or tertiary hospitals, most pediatric 162 patients requiring hospitalization in HCMC are referred or self-referred to one of the three study hospitals. 163 Therefore, the three study hospitals (CH1, CH2, and HTD) receive the majority of pediatric two main seasons in HCMC: a dry season from December to April and a rainy season from 167 May to November. Population and district characteristic data (urban vs. rural districts, district population 168 density, district economic indicators (expenditure of district budget, revenues of district budget), district 169 agricultural indicators (number of pigs in herds > 2 months of age by district, % area of district used as 170 rice paddy), and district education indicator (number of primary and secondary schools per district) were 171 obtained from the HCMC Statistical Office[17]. As population figures for those aged <16 years per ward 172 or district was not obtainable, the total population was used to estimate disease incidence. Patient 173 addresses in HCMC were geocoded to districts and wards. City level weekly average climate data during 174 2005-2010 were obtained from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam including 175 relative humidity (median=76.5%, range=61.7% to 88%), temperature (median=28.1\u00b0C, range=24.4\u00b0C to 176 31.8\u00b0C), rainfall (median=24.4mm, range=0mm to 230.7mm) and water level of the Dong",

These conditions can usually be treated in outpatient settings and do not typically 338 require hospitalization. However, the decision to hospitalize ARI patients in these tertiary hospitals is not 339 strictly based on the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines and is also 340 dependent on the preferences of caregivers and the subjective patient evaluation of the attending 341 physicians. Therefore, there should stricter policies for applying IMCI guidelines and other clinical 342 criteria to reduce unnecessary URI admissions in these hospitals, as well as to improving outpatient care 343Our study has limitations as the findings were generated using routine data of from hospitalized patients. 346Therefore, are finding may be generalizable for outpatients, especially for URIs, as many patients with 347 URI may not be admitted to hospital. The findings for LRIs may be more generalizable as LRIs are more 348 severe than URIs and more likely to be hospitalized. Second, the databases contained mostly general 349 ICD10 codes and very limited specific diagnostic information regarding the ARI pathogens. Different 350 pathogens can cause differing URI and LRI disease presentations and different pathogens may be 351 influenced differently by climatic, environmental, population factors as well as host immunity. Therefore, 352 further surveillance and studies investigating different groups of pathogens for ARIs are necessary. 353",
