We also found that natural FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is negligible in the blood circulation of healthy subjects, but clearly detected in the serum collection tubes, thus we concluded that FIC5.9 is released from fibrinogen during the process of blood coagulation [8] . That is, FIC5.9 is an in vitro product that is released during blood clotting from fibrinogen (Fig. 1b) . Since our initial identification of FIC5.9, the same peptide (if not identified completely, but with the completely same mass) has been reported as a biomarker in several pathological conditions, including cancers and inflammatory disorders [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

Especially we focused on the coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. FIC5.9 sequence includes amino acids 576-629 of the fibrinogen alpha chain (Fig. 2 ) and FIC5.9 appears to be synthesized by cleavage at RGK/SSS (N-terminal region) and RPV/RGI (C-terminal region) [4] . Coagulation and fibrinolysis factor, thrombin and plasmin are major enzymes that cleave to the carboxyl side of lysine work with fibrinogen or fibrin [15] . There are fewer reports of enzymes in blood that cleave to the carboxyl side of valine, but neutrophil elastase is one of such example [16] . In this study, as a first step toward understanding the mechanisms of FIC5.9 changes in various pathologies, we tested the hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by these enzymes in apparently healthy subjects.",

Deficiency of factor II, V, VIII and X decreased the FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen (Additional file 1), and that factor II (thrombin) had a particularly marked effect on the releasing of FIC5.9 from fibrinogen. We reconfirmed that FIC5.9 is released in the serum collection tube during blood clotting. To determine the coagulation and fibrinolysis factors responsible to release FIC5.9, we narrowed down the candidate enzymes based on these results. Information of enzyme cleavage sites was obtained from the Peptidase Database (MEROPS: http://merops.sanger.ac.uk. Accessed 21 September 2013). and we finally choose thrombin, plasmin, and neutrophil elastase [17] [18] [19] . We degraded purified fibrinogen with these enzymes and the sequences of degradation products were analyzed by LC-MS/MS ( Fig. 3 ; Additional file 2). Our degradation conditions showed that several cleavage sites are found in fibrinogen alpha C terminal domain, but especially the N-terminal region of FIC5.9 (RGK/SSS) was cleaved by thrombin or plasmin, and the C-terminal region of FIC5.9 (RPV/RGI) was cleaved by neutrophil elastase. While we tried fibrinogen digestion experiment, using thrombin, plasmin, neutrophil elastase, and their mixture, we could not form FIC5.9 itself from fibrinogen, but observed its fragments in vitro (data not shown).",

In all experiments (Fig. 4) , 0 min of clotting could not eliminate a time lag of serum separation (a time for blood reaches from venous blood collection needle to blood collection tube, and centrifugation duration), and FIC5.9 level was not found to be zero at 0 min. The rate of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen with added thrombin was significantly faster than that in silica-coated tubes.

Addition of plasmin significantly increased the releasing rate and total amount of FIC5.9, and addition of tranexamic acid (plasmin inhibitor) markedly decreased the FIC5.9 releasing (Fig. 4b) .

To confirm that these enzymes can release FIC5.9 during blood coagulation, we analyzed the time course of FIC5.9 release was determined in serum collection tubes spiked with thrombin (and its inhibitor, hirudin), plasmin (and its inhibitor, tranexamic acid) and sivelestat sodium (neutrophil elastase inhibitor) (Fig. 4) . Addition of thrombin (or their inhibitor, hirudin) accelerated (or delayed) the releasing of FIC5.9 from fibrinogen, but the amounts of FIC5.9 at 90 min clotting had no significance. It is clear that blood clotting initiates FIC5.9 releasing, and FIC5.9 is negligible in the blood circulation, but found in serum collection tubes. However, these results do not demonstrate thrombin plays a main role in FIC5.9 releasing when once blood clotting process is started in serum collection tubes. We conclude thrombin play a role of initiation element of FIC5.9 releasing by starting blood clotting with its activity.",

While thinking thrombin is an initiation element of FIC5.9 releasing, these results indicate that plasmin is the major enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal region of FIC5.9 and affects the amount of FIC5.9. In nature, activation of plasminogen to plasmin occurs after activation of coagulation factors including thrombin [22, 23] . These reports also support the role of thrombin as the initiator of FIC5.9 synthesis. Inhibition of plasmin activity significantly suppressed FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen (Fig. 4) . The suppression of plasmin by tranexamic acid was significant, but not completely. It may be due to other enzymes which can cleave the N-terminal end of FIC5.9; in fact, our in vitro digestion experiments (Fig. 3) show thrombin can cleave N-terminal end of FIC5.9. Taken together, plasmin seems to play a main role in cleaving N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and releasing FIC5.9.",

Neutrophil elastase cleaves the C-terminal site of FIC5.9, but only a few reports indicate that the level of neutrophil elastase (or the neutrophil count) changes in the early stage of chronic hepatitis [24, 25] . Therefore, the C-terminal site of FIC5.9 is likely to be cleaved at a similar level in healthy people and patients with chronic hepatitis. However, an extreme increase or decrease in neutrophils might affect FIC5.9 releasing. A spike test of neutrophil elastase into the collection tube could not be performed because we could not obtain enough amount of elastase. Indeed, significant volume of enzyme was needed for experiment with blood collection tubes. However, the results of LC-MS/MS indicated that neutrophil elastase can cleave the C-terminal region of FIC5.9. This requires confirmation in a further study.",

In addition, plasma fibrinogen has been proposed as a marker for chronic liver disease [33] . As these reports show, the low level of FIC5.9 releasing in chronic hepatitis is not simply due to enzymatic reactions, but also to a decrease in fibrinogen synthesis (a decrease in the precursor to FIC5.9).

FIC5.9 is also a degradation product from fibrinogen alpha chain that is released by coagulation and fibrinolysis factors, and reflects a minute change in these factors. Thrombin, plasmin and neutrophil elastase are involved in the key mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing in clotting of normal blood.
