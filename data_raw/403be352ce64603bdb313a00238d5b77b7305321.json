The emergence of new IB virus (IBV) variants might lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure. Information about circulating IBV in a region is important to decide which IB vaccine should be used. However, information about recent IBV strains which circulated in Indonesia and their genetic characters were limited; therefore, the aim of our research was to determine the genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia.",

The S protein has two glycopolypeptide components which are S1 and S2. The spike protein S1 undergoes inhibitor of agglutination and induces neutralizing antibody [2] . S1 protein functioned as differentiating factor among IB virus (IBV) strains and as a main target of genotype characterization. It also plays an important role in attachment and virus entries into cells through cyanic acid receptor [4] . Amino acid variation in glycoprotein S1 took important place to tissue tropism and IB virulence [5] .",

Outbreaks were also occurred at vaccinated flocks, indicating vaccination failure; however, vaccination is the only practical means of controlling IB. Problem in vaccination is that it is only partially successful due to the continual emergence of antigenic variants. IBV strains within a geographic region are unique, even many countries share same antigenic types, so the selection of an appropriate antigenic type for the region is important, given the existence of wide antigenic variation [7] . The variants of IBV have not been well-documented in Indonesia since the lack of the characterization of this virus [8] . Understanding epidemiological condition and virus changes are important in designing IB vaccination strategies, to provide greater protection against enzootic strains, and the vaccination must be commonly practiced based on the field needs [9] . The previous study showed that the majority of IBV strain isolated in Indonesia were related to Massachusetts (Mass) and Connecticut (Conn), and serotype N2/62 originated from Australia [10] , IBV local isolates [11] , IBV close to vaccine virus strain 4/91 [12] , and IBV originated from Taiwan and China [8] .",
