Here I review recent studies on the microbiology of the built environment, organize their findings into 12 major thematic categories, and comment on how these studies have or have not advanced knowledge in each area beyond what we already knew from over 100 years of applying culturebased methods to building samples. I propose that while we have added tremendous complexity to the rich existing knowledge base, the practical implications of this added complexity remain somewhat elusive. It remains to be seen how this new knowledge base will change how we design, build, and operate buildings. Much more research is needed to better understand the complexity with which indoor microbiomes may affect human health in both positive and negative ways.",

However, more-recent studies utilizing molecular methods have illuminated \"an entirely new dimension of microbial diversity\" in indoor environments ranging from child-care facilities (10) to residences (11) . As an example of this vastly increased complexity, a recent study found that the Staphylococcus genus comprised only~4% of the identifiable taxa in indoor air samples from 29 homes in San Francisco, CA, with major contributions from nearly 20 other taxa ranging from Comamonadaceae to Methylocystaceae (12) .",

For example, an early study of settled dust in two buildings in Finland found that there were clear differences in bacterial flora in each building and that the differences between buildings were greater than the differences between seasons (16). Hewitt et al. found that bacterial communities on surfaces in offices in Tucson, AZ, were clearly distinguishable from those in New York, NY, and San Francisco, CA, while bacterial counts were higher on surfaces in Tucson and New York than in San Francisco (17) . More recently, Lax et al. found that microbial communities on surfaces in several U.S. residences differed substantially among homes and that microbiota in each home were identifiable by family (11) . Further, Meadow et al. found that people release their own personalized microbial cloud with distinct microbial communities that can be used to identify individual occupants (18) .",

The same has been recently confirmed in house dust samples from approximately 1,200 U.S. homes (20) .

Repeated studies of varied indoor environments have used source-tracking algorithms (34) to illustrate that humans (and pets, if present) often dominate bacterial communities found on indoor surfaces (20) . Microbes associated with human skin (and to a lesser extent, the human gut) have been shown to be ubiquitous on surfaces in a wide variety of buildings, including public restrooms (15, 29) , residential kitchens (28), neonatal intensive care units (35), and bathrooms, bedrooms, and other commonly occupied microenvironments in homes (30). Source-tracking techniques have also been used to reveal how changes in human occupancy affect microbes on surfaces. For example, Lax et al. demonstrated that when a person traveled away from home for a few days, the relative contribution of bacterial taxa associated with that person rapidly declined but then rapidly increased on many surfaces after the person returned home (11) . Further, after a family moved into a new house, the microbial community in the new house rapidly converged on the microbial communities found in the occupants' former house. As another example, Gibbons et al. demonstrated that gut-and skin-associated taxa persisted for weeks to months on surfaces in a public restroom after initial dispersal from humans (15) . Stephens, and J. A. Gilbert, submitted for publication). However, taxa shared with the skin of the current patient were found to be more abundant on patient room surfaces after the patient had spent a night in the room, while taxa shared with room surfaces were more abundant on the patient's skin when the patient first entered a new patient room. In other words, patients appear to initially acquire room-associated bacterial taxa that predate their stay, but their own microbial signatures later influence the room (and longer stays further encourage the latter).",

Hospodsky et al. also demonstrated that human emissions were the dominant source of bacterial concentrations measured in five of six occupied children's classrooms that they studied and that outdoor air ventilation was the dominant bacterial source in only one of those classrooms (36). Qian et al. estimated that students in a university classroom emit~37 \u03eb 10 6 bacterial genomes per person per hour and~7.3 \u03eb 10 6 fungal genomes per person per hour, on average (37) . Subsequent real-time measurements made using an UV aerodynamic particle sizer (UV-APS) further demonstrated that classroom occupants emit~2 \u03eb 10 6 fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAPs) per person per hour, on average, and that more vigorous occupant activity during transitions between lectures led to greater FBAP emissions.",

Subsequently, more-controlled chamber studies have elucidated the relative importance of three main mechanisms of human microbial emissions: (i) direct shedding from skin and clothing, (ii) resuspension of settled particles, and (iii) direct surface contact. Bhangar et al. used a UV-APS to measure microbial emissions from people seated in a chamber doing simulated office work and found an average value of~10 6 FBAPs per person per hour (38) . Walking increased FBAP emissions approximately 5 to 6 times compared to seated office work. Further, during both walking and sitting, more than two-thirds of the emissions were found to originate from the floor (i.e., resuspension was the dominant mode), while direct shedding from skin and clothing contributed to the remaining emissions. The dominant particle size was~3 to 5 m for all activities.",

Several studies have shown that building design and operation can influence indoor microbial communities. As an example of the impact of building operation, the source (and delivery rate) of outdoor ventilation air has been shown to have a large influence on indoor microbial communities. Kembel et al. found that when a room was ventilated primarily via outdoor airflow through an open window, it had a higher level of bacterial diversity than when the room was ventilated using a mechanical heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system with the window closed (39). Kembel et al. found similar results in offices, where the source of ventilation air had the greatest effect on bacterial community structure (40) . Their results clearly demonstrated that the relative abundance of certain taxa were more prevalent during window ventilation periods than mechanical ventilation periods (and vice versa). Further, in buildings with high outdoor air ventilation rates, indoor air bacterial communities tend to more closely track those found in outdoor air, which diminishes the influence of human emissions more so than in buildings with lower outdoor air ventilation rates (41, 42) . As another set of examples of the influence of building operation, Dannemiller et al. found that higher fungal richness (i.e., the mean number of fungal operational taxonomic units [OTUs] ) was associated with a higher prevalence of air-conditioner use in homes (43) , and Weikl et al. found that variations in fungal communities in house dust were significantly correlated with the prevalence of window opening (44) .",

Measures of bacterial community composition were not found to be associated with any of the indoor or material environmental parameters that were assessed, while fungal community richness was only weakly correlated with equilibrium relative humidity measured at the surface of the building materials. This work adds to the evidence (15) that most indoor environments (without prior water or dampness problems) are extremely scarce in water and nutrients and that although microbes are clearly dispersed onto surfaces, they likely either die or lie dormant, \"waiting for liquid water to become active again\" (49) .

Last, after decades of indoor microbiology research focusing primarily on human exposure to infectious agents (64) (65) (66) (67) and asthma/allergy triggers (68-70) that yield adverse health outcomes, evidence is emerging that some measures of microbial diversity and/or abundance in indoor environments may actually be beneficial for human health. For example, Fujimura et al. demonstrated that mice exposed to dog-associated house dust had a distinct gut microbiome composition (i.e., enriched for Lactobacillus johnsonii) and were protected against airway allergen challenges (71). Dannemiller et al. found that in human populations, lower fungal diversity in house dust (assessed by number of fungal OTUs) was significantly associated with childhood asthma development in a small case-control study (72) . Further, a decrease in the genus Cryptococcus was significantly associated with increased asthma risk, while no fungal taxa were positively associated with asthma development. In a larger birth cohort, Lynch et al. found that while cumulative residential allergen exposure over the first 3 years of life was associated with allergic sensitization at age 3, first-year exposure to some allergens (e.g., cockroach, mouse, and cat allergens), as well as reduced exposure to specific Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, were associated with atopy and atopic wheeze (73) . Thus, exposure to high levels of certain allergens and certain bacteria in very early life stages might be beneficial for health. Somewhat similarly, Dannemiller et al. found that increased concentrations of the sum of allergenic fungal species and total fungal concentrations were both associated with increased asthma severity in a cohort study of asthmatic children (74) . Conversely, some genera, including the yeast genus Kondoa, appeared to be protective against asthma severity. While these studies remain limited, they offer promising insight into the complexity of the impacts that indoor microbiomes may have on human health.",

The point is probably best illustrated by one of the oldest published investigations of indoor air of which I am aware, an article published in 1887 by Carnelley et al. entitled \"The Carbonic Acid, Organic Matter, and Micro-Organisms in Air, More Especially of Dwellings and Schools\" (75) .

Until molecular methods and statistical techniques advance to a state in which more-complex microbial characteristics (e.g., gene expression and function) can easily and cheaply be assessed in environmental samples, the true usefulness of molecular techniques may be best realized when used in conjunction with traditional methods of culturing and viability assessments (15) . In fact, looking back at one of the earliest applications of molecular methods to indoor environments, in 2007, Lee et al. stated that \"the combination of culture and cultureindependent methods provided powerful means for determining both viability and diversity of bacteria in child-care facilities\" (10) .

More specifically, Lax et al. found that bacterial communities sampled from the hands of patients in the hospital became more similar to the bacterial communities sampled from the floor of their rooms with each additional day of stay (S.
