We aimed to investigate whether primary cultures of human respiratory tract epithelial cells are helpful to understand H7N9 virus pathogenesis and tissue tropism, and to evaluate how patient-related characteristics can affect the host's response to infection. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (isolated from two different donors) and primary epithelial cells (harvested from 27 patients undergoing airway surgery) were experimentally infected with H7N9 and/or H1N1pdm for 72 h. After virus infection, the culture media were collected for viral RNA quantitation and cytokine detection. Both H7N9 and H1N1pdm viruses replicated and induced a cytokine response differently for each donor in the normal human bronchial epithelial model. H7N9 replicated equivalently in epithelial cells harvested from the inferior turbinate and paranasal sinus, and those from the larynx and bronchus, at 72 h post-infection. Viral RNA quantity at 72 h was significantly higher in patients aged 21-64 years than in patients aged \u2265 65 years; however, no effects of sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity were noted. H7N9-infected cultured cells released multiple cytokines within 72 h. Levels of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interferon-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were associated differently with patient-related characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity, and medical comorbidities). www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/ In the era of precision medicine, these findings illustrate the potential utility of this primary culture approach to predict a host's response to H7N9 infection or to future infection by newly emerging viral infections, and to dissect viral pathogenesis.",

The clinical presentation of H7N9 infections varies with the individual; however, fever and cough generally represent the core symptoms [2] . Serious complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Although the first outbreak has subsided, four subsequent seasonal epidemics were observed in China [3] . The severe illness of H7N9 infections and the presence of natural reservoirs represent significant concerns. In this context, the identification of vulnerable subjects is paramount to the prevention of spread.",

However, evidence also indicates that: 1) H7N9 viruses are transmissible from ferrets in a direct contact setting [5] [6] [7] ; 2) they can bind to both human and avian receptors [8] ; 3) they can attach to the epithelium in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans [9] ; and 4) they efficiently propagate in human alveolar tissue [10] . All of these features are important factors for human-to-human transmission. Fortunately, H7N9 viruses do not appear to transmit easily from person to person. However, there are many more factors that are important in the adaptation to sustained inter-human transmission. In this scenario, primary cultures of human respiratory tract epithelial cells would be invaluable to understand H7N9 virus tissue tropism and pathogenesis, as well as to evaluate how patient-related characteristics can modulate the host's response to infection.",

An age-and sex-based analysis of 63 patients infected by the H7N9 virus showed that elderly men are most commonly affected, whereas no deaths were observed in elderly women. Age-dependent changes in the airway epithelium mean that older patients may be more prone to respiratory tract infections [16] and the development of symptomatic H7N9 disease [11] . Moreover, the presence of comorbidities is the only independent risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome in H7N9-infected individuals [2] . In the most recent epidemic episode in China (during September to December 2016 (n = 114)), distributions of age, sex, and severe illness remained unchanged compared with other epidemics [3] . Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which age, sex, medical comorbidity, and obesity can influence H7N9 virus replication kinetics remain unclear. However, numerous studies have shown that increased levels of specific proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are robust predictors of morbidity and mortality in H7N9infected patients [2, 8, [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

While these studies have recognized many important characteristics that can help to understand the pathogenesis of influenza viruses, few studies have investigated personto-person differences in virus replication and the influenzarelated cytokines and chemokines of respiratory epithelial cell cultures. Recently, Mindaye et al. [26] found different protein expression levels of pro-viral and antiviral factors among normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells isolated from three different donors, and suggested that this model may provide a way to identify individuals or population groups who are susceptible to severe influenza disease. In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that respiratory epithelial cells from different human donors would vary in their response to influenza virus infections. To determine the impact of age on cellular response after influenza virus infection, commercial NHBE cells cultured from 24-year-old and 69-year-old donors were infected with both H1N1pdm virus (A/California/07/2009 [27] ) and avian H7N9 virus (A/Taiwan/4-CGMH/2014 [28] ), and viral growth kinetics and the cytokine response were compared. We further explored how different donors' characteristics (i.e., age, sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity) could influence both virus replication kinetics and the cytokine response to experimental H7N9 infections. Human respiratory tract primary epithelial cells were cultured from patients undergoing upper or lower airway surgery and experimentally infected with H7N9. The limited amount of primary epithelial cells available from each patient meant that only H7N9 virus infection was conducted.",

An earlyonset cytokine storm is associated with H7N9-related mortality [18, 20] ; therefore, we specifically focused on the six cytokines that were found to most consistently predict death in previous studies (i.e., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and TNF-\u03b1). Such molecules are also produced by human airway epithelial cells [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , and are termed \"core cytokines\" in the present study. In cases in which the cytokine concentration was undetectable, we assumed a value of 0.1 pg/mL for statistical purposes, in accordance with the recommendation of Guo et al. [20] . Figure 1B shows that the IL-1\u03b2 levels in the culture media of H7N9 virus-infected 24-year-old NHBE cells were significantly higher than those of the Mock and H1N1pdm virusinfected 24-year-old NHBE cells at 48 and 72 h p.i.

Figure 1C reveals that the IL-6 levels in the culture media were not related to virus type or the donor's age. In Figure 1D , the IL-8 level of the culture medium of H7N9-infected 24-year-old NHBE cells was significantly higher than those of the Mock and H1N1pdm",

The anatomical sites from which the primary epithelial cell cultures were obtained were as follows: inferior turbinate (n = 14 [52%]), paranasal sinus (n = 4 [15%]), larynx (n = 1 [4%]), and bronchus (n = 8 [30%]). There were relatively fewer numbers of paranasal sinus-and larynxderived cultures; therefore, we combined the inferior turbinate and paranasal sinus-derived cultures as \"upper anatomical location\" (n = 18 [67%]) and larynx-and bronchus-derived cultures as \"lower anatomical location\" (n = 9 [33%]) for statistical evaluation. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients revealed that a lower anatomical location was significantly inversely associated with male sex (r = -0.75, P < 0.001). Age \u2265 65 years, medical comorbidity, and obesity were not significantly associated with the other patient characteristics (all P > 0.05). The epithelial origin (\u2265 95%) of cultured cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody.",

Intriguingly, infections of the upper airways were associated with a marked release of IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 within 72 h p.i. These observations suggested that the H7N9 virus infection induces a site-specific, amplified, local innate immune response [44] . Notably, Chan et al. [22] found that H7N9 virus infection did not enhance the mRNA expression of IL-8 in peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. These findings suggested that IL-8 released by H7N9-infected epithelial cells of the respiratory tract could be an important clue to the development of severe disease.",

In our study, cells from patients with medical comorbidities produced higher IL-8 levels after experimental infection compared with those from otherwise healthy individuals, which might explain the absence of an association between medical comorbidities and the severity of H7N9 infections after adjustment for age and sex [14] . Obesity was significantly associated with a higher increase in viral RNA quantities; a higher level of IL-8 at 24 h and a lower level at 72 h p.i.; and less pronounced increases in IL-1\u03b2 and IP-10. Our data indicated that cells derived from obese individuals have subtle but widespread changes in viral replication and cytokine response following experimental H7N9 infection.

Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that our findings related to H7N9 viral replication and its related cytokine response might be different in vivo. Second, because of the limited amount of primary epithelial cells, we did not include control virus infections in the primary culture model of explanted cells to verify the viral response. However, we confirmed that the H7N9 virus could replicate and induce a cytokine response differently from H1N1pdm virus in the NHBE experiment. Moreover, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus A/Anhui/1/13 could attach moderately or abundantly to both the upper and lower respiratory tract, and could be replicated in primary cultures of the nasopharynx and bronchus [9] . Nevertheless, the primary epithelial cells used in the present study seemed to reflect the properties of virus infection in patients, where the virus interacts with primary epithelial cells. Finally, the relatively small sample size precluded the analysis of a greater number of host characteristics that could affect virus replication kinetics and cytokine response. Further studies are needed to confirm and expand our findings.",

Our results require independent replication in clinical studies before the widespread use of our primary cellular model can be recommended. However, our platform is less costly and labor-intensive than the use of animal models to mimic H7N9 virus infection. Our preliminary results using a primary cellular model have revealed many interesting differences among patient responses, and might represent a potential tool to identify individuals more prone to developing severe H7N9 infections.",

Epithelial cells were expanded in parallel using standard methods [23] [24] [25] . After rinsing and removal of excess tissue, specimens were minced into cubes (2-3-mm 3 ) and transferred onto a six-well Transwell cell culture system. Each Transwell was coated with collagen (30 \u03bcg/mL), fibronectin (10 \u03bcg/mL), and fetal bovine serum (10 \u03bcg/mL) and allowed to adhere. Culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/ Ham F12, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 1% fetal bovine serum) was added basolaterally to the co-culture dishes, and the plates were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere. The culture solution was changed every two days. When the epithelial cells grew around the explant to cover a 1-2 cm 2 area (approximately 2-3 weeks), tissue explants were transferred onto new scratched and coated plates. When confluent monolayers were observed, epithelial cells in the Transwells were infected with the H7N9 virus.",

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for H7N9 virus load quantitation. Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatants using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) and subjected to qRT-PCR. We used the FluA primers and probe originally developed by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre in Beijing, China (2013). The nucleotide sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5\u2032-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3\u2032; probe, 5\u2032-FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BHQ1-3\u2032. In brief, 140 \u03bcL of supernatant was mixed with 560 \u03bcL of lysis buffer (350 \u03bcL for up to 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells). The volume of extracted RNA was adjusted to 30 \u03bcL with RNase-free water. Negative controls consisted of sterile water and were subjected to all the preparation steps in parallel with the extracted samples. A RealTime ready RNA virus master kit (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH Mannheim, Germany) was used for amplification. To set up the amplification reaction, 5 \u03bcL of template was added to each reaction tube; the working concentrations for the primers and probe were 10 and 5 \u03bcM, respectively. The final volume for the qRT-PCR was 25 \u03bcL. Reverse transcription and amplification were carried out in a onestep reaction on a Bio-Rad PCR system (CFX96; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The conditions for qRT-PCR were as follows: 45 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 45 s. The qRT-PCR was repeated for samples with a Ct value > 38. PCR products were cloned into a plasmid to generate positive controls. For quantification, plasmid DNAs at six different concentrations, from 10 copies/\u03bcL to 10 6 copies/\u03bcL, were run in parallel with all the samples.",

To avoid gaps in the assay results and inaccuracies in the estimates of concentrations, a value of 0.1 pg/mL was entered in the data set when an analyte was undetectable [20] . Means and standard errors of the mean were used to summarize continuous variables. The viral RNA quantities and cytokines were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. At selected time-points, viral RNA quantities and cytokine levels were compared according to both the anatomical locations of the explant and patient-related characteristics of interest using GEE models [36] , which were employed to determine whether changes in virus and cytokine levels were significantly different at specific time-points after adjusting for anatomical location and patient-related characteristics, or between different anatomical locations and patient-related characteristics after adjustment for other confounding variables. The use of GEE allowed the monitoring of viral RNA quantities and cytokine level as a function of time, anatomical location, age, sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity. The anatomical locations of the explants were dichotomized for the purpose of analysis in the upper (inferior turbinate and paranasal sinus) versus lower (larynx and bronchus) respiratory tract. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to analyze the associations between patient-related characteristics, viral RNA quantities, and cytokine levels. We applied Benjamini and Hochberg's approach to control the false discovery rate. All statistical calculations were performed with the G * Power 3.1.9.2 software (Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany), the IBM SPSS (version 23; International Business Machines Corp.), and the GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 7.0; GraphPad Software, Inc.) software packages.

Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured from a 24-yearold female and a 69-year-old female and experimentally infected with the H7N9 or H1N1pdm virus. Viral RNA quantity (log-transformed) and cytokine values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate their differences at each time point, or a Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate their difference between various time points. a P < 0.05. RNA quantity increased significantly from 1 to 72 h post infection (p.i.) in the culture supernatants of the NHBE cells after experimental infection with the H7N9 virus or H1N1pdm virus, when all cultures were considered in combination. In the H1N1pdm virus or H7N9 virusinfected supernatants, viral RNA quantity reached a plateau between 48 and 72 h p.i. (P = 0.753 and 0.249, respectively).Table 1summarizes the viral RNA quantity in influenza virus-infected culture supernatants harvested from NHBE cells isolated from two different donors. Differences in viral RNA quantities between H7N9 and H1N1pdm virus infections were not significant at each time point in the same NHBE cells. Viral RNA quantities of both influenza viruses measured in culture medium of NHBE cells obtained from a 24-year-old female donor were significantly higher than those obtained from a 69-year-old donor at each time point (P = 0.041, 0.002, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the viral RNA quantity detected in H7N9-infected cell culture medium of the 24-year-old NHBE cells was the highest among all cultures from 48 to 72 h p.i., whereas the viral RNA quantity of the H1N1pdm-infected 69-year-old culture medium was the lowest from 24 to 72 h p.i. (all P values < 0.05).",
