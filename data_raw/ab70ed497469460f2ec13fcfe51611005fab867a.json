            "text": "Aging-related decline in immunity is believed to be the main driver behind decreased vaccine efficacy and reduced resistance to infections in older adults. Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age-related phenotypes. Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole-body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5-4 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age. None of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock-irradiated (0 Gy) animals for the parameters measured. Even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal WBI in youth (4 Gy) exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis, robust T-and B-cell responses to live attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal WNV challenge. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model.",

The elderly are particularly susceptible to emergent or 'never-before-seen' pathogens, such as the West Nile virus (WNV) (Murray et al., 2006) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (Leung et al., 2004) and chikungunya virus (Borgherini et al., 2007) . Vaccine efficacy is also dramatically decreased in the elderly (McElhaney, 2002) . Despite the presence of other factors, including, but not limited to, changes in microbial colonization with aging, the reduced function of barrier tissues, and hormonal, proteostatic, metabolic, and other changes with aging, it is believed that a common and variable decline in immunity, called immune aging or immune senescence, decisively contributes to these changes. Both innate and adaptive immune systems are affected by aging (rev. in Haynes & Swain, 2012; Kogut et al., 2012; Nikolich-Zugich, 2014) . Age-associated T-cell defects include decreased na\u20ac \u0131ve T-cell (T N ) abundance and proportional increase in memory cells, reduction in proliferation and function (rev. in Maue et al., 2009; Haynes & Swain, 2012; Nikolich-Zugich, 2014) , and inability to defend against intracellular infections (Brien et al., 2009; Smithey et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2013) . Pathogen-specific antibody production and efficacy also decrease with age (Frasca & Blomberg, 2009; Kogut et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Irradiation-induced damage to genetic material has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest and repair responses for over fifty years (Painter & Robertson, 1959; Hollaender & Curtis, 1975) . However, some of the arrested cells did not die, nor repair to re-enter cell cycle. Rather, they survived for prolonged periods of time and, similar to the phenotype described by Hayflick on fibroblast doublings in culture, were deemed to be 'senescent' (Hayflick & Moorhead, 1961) . From there, a subset of theories of biological aging suggested that many cells, including immune cells, may have defective functions in old age because of a lifetime of self-renewal and DNA damage-related senescence (Hasty et al., 2003; Campisi, 2005; d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008; Lopez-Otin et al., 2013) . However, the role of DNA damage in biological aging (excluding its obvious and critical importance in disturbing genome integrity and precipitating cancer) remains incompletely understood. Specifically, if DNA damage repair is the key and limiting mechanism in longevity and biological aging, one would expect that gain-of-function DNA repair mutants would extend maximal lifespan and that human longitudinal studies would demonstrate associations between increased maximal lifespan and superior DNA repair. Such evidence, however, has been scant and difficult to come by so far, with one recent study showing an increase in lifespan following overexpression of antioxidating enzyme that excludes 8-oxoguanine from nucleic acids (De Luca et al., 2013) and with no human longitudinal data published as yet to the best of our knowledge. It is therefore important to assess how resilient is the DNA repair system and whether and how it combines with biological aging to produce measurable phenotypes.",

Hematopoietic cells are amongst the most radiosensitive cells in mammals and lymphocytes are among the most sensitive hematopoietic lineage cells. In mice, hematopoietic cell death is detectable at WBI doses of 0.5 gray (Gy), and severe systemic depletion is induced in the 4 Gy range (Anderson & Warner, 1976) , with lethal outcome occurring between 7 and 10 Gy depending on the strain (Grahn & Hamilton, 1957) . Specifically, C57BL/6 (B6) mice are estimated to be about twice as radioresistant as humans, in whom the same effects occur at half the doses mentioned above (rev. in Nias, 1990) .",

We then followed the animals longitudinally into the old age to examine immune response to a single-cycle live vaccine, RepliVAX West Nile (R-WN) (Widman et al., 2009) , and protective immunity following a subsequent challenge with a potentially lethal dose of live West Nile virus (WNV). In unmanipulated mice, R-WN vaccination is sufficient to provide strong protection to both adult and old mice against lethal WNV challenge (Uhrlaub et al., 2011) , providing a good baseline with which to measure the potential exacerbation of immune aging-induced by DNA damage. We found that, perhaps contrary to the expectations predicted by the DNA damage aging theories, a single WBI exposure in youth did not decrease late-life survival from WNV challenge following vaccination. Vaccine and WNV-specific immunity, including Tcell and antibody responses, were not substantially affected by WBI dose in youth. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging and decreased immune function and protection in a lethal vaccine challenge model. These results are encouraging from the standpoint of defined, accidental exposure to sublethal ionizing radiation of the immune system.",

To test these hypotheses, we employed the experimental strategy outlined in Fig. 1 . Agematched, adult, male B6 mice were divided into groups receiving 0, 1, 2, or 4 gray (Gy) of WBI in a single dose. (Another group of animals irradiated at 0.5 Gy was initially used in our first set of experiments, but that dose subsequently abandoned because it showed no substantial difference from 1 Gy group.) Mice were allowed to rest for 72 h, and six randomized mice from each group were euthanized to confirm systemic hematopoietic cell death in a WBI dose-dependent manner across primary and secondary organs. No mice died as a result of WBI exposure at these doses, as would be expected from the WBI LD 50/30 of this strain (Grahn & Hamilton, 1957) . Another cross-sectional harvest of representative mice from each group was collected at~13 months of age, long after complete repopulation of immune cells. In addition, immune populations in peripheral blood were tracked at 3-month intervals from WBI until 19 months of age. At 19 months of age, mice were injected with RWN vaccine, which we have previously shown to protect old mice from WNV (Uhrlaub et al., 2011) . We examined effector responses to the vaccine, allowed for immune memory to form and mature for 60 days, and then challenged the mice with a potentially lethal dose of live WNV. During vaccination and challenge, WNV-specific T-cell and antibody immunity were assayed. This design was completed on two independent large cohorts of mice ( Fig. 1 ).",

As expected, WBI resulted in cell death and depletion of a variety of immune cell subsets in a dosedependent manner across lymphoid tissues ( Fig. 2A-D) . We recently demonstrated that these irradiation doses cause the expected DNA damage, including histone marking by ATM kinase, in all assessed T-cell and other nucleated blood cell subsets (Pugh et al., 2014) . While we did not directly assess the damage to hematopoietic cells, our irradiation dose was carefully controlled by calibration and dose absorbance (Pugh et al., 2014; Seed et al., 2016) and was in the range documented by others to cause hematopoietic stem cell damage (Mohrin et al., 2010) . Age-matched, adult, male, C57BL/six mice with identical birthdates were divided into groups receiving 0, 1, 2, or 4 gray (Gy) of WBI in a single dose. A cross-sectional harvest of representative mice from each group was collected at 3 days following WBI. A similar crosssectional harvest occurred at 13 months of age, long after complete repopulation of immune cells. Immune populations in peripheral blood were tracked at 3-month intervals from PBMC until 19 months of age. At 19 months of age, mice were injected with 10 5 pfu RWN vaccine i.p. Immune function and antibody generation were assayed 45 days postvaccination. Sixty days postvaccination, mice were challenged with 2000 pfu WNV i.p. and mice were tracked for survival. This experimental design was completed in its entirety on two separate cohorts of mice, with birthdates separated by approximately 1 year. Immune cell populations from PBMC were assayed throughout lifetime, starting 30 days following WBI. At 30 days post-WBI, populations of CD4 and CD8 T N cell counts remained depressed relative to nonirradiated controls (Fig. 2G,H) . Similarly, B-cell counts in PBMC had not fully recovered by 30 days (Fig. S2C ). Radioresistant NK cells, however, had fully repopulated by 30 days following WBI (Fig. S2D ). Typical declines in CD4 and CD8 T N cells were observed with aging in mock-irradiated mice (Figs. 2A and 3B). These declines were accompanied by slight increases in the total counts of central memory CD8 T cells (CM), and effector memory CD8 T cells (EM) over lifespan (Fig. S2G,H) . However, counts of CD8 and CD4 T N cells from irradiated mice were not depressed relative to mock-irradiated controls by 19 months of age ( Fig. 2G,H) . There also were no significant differences by 19 months of age in peripheral counts of CD8 CM, CD8 EM, nor cdT cells among the groups, regardless of irradiation in youth ( Fig. S2F-J) . Counts of B cells in PBMC were depressed among mice that received 4 Gy in youth, relative to all other groups, by 19 months of age. However, B-cell counts for that group also remained within the range of natural variation over lifespan (4 Gy mean at final time point = 5249 cells, 0 Gy range at initial time point 2410-7406 cells) (Fig. S2D ). Of importance, the extent of DNA damage, as judged by the histone marking (cH2-AX), was unremarkable and did not differ with the dose of radiation exposure in youth in any of the T-cell subsets examined (na\u20ac \u0131ve, central, and effector memory, Fig. S3 ).",

We therefore conclude that the presence and the dose of irradiation in youth did not affect in vivo accumulation (total numbers, Fig. 3A ), proliferation (Ki-67+ %, Fig. 3B ), or differentiation (% Granzyme B+ cells, Fig. 3C ) of effector CD8 T cells at the peak of the response to a live attenuated vaccine in the old age.",

Again, we found no difference in numbers of memory CD8+ NS4b+ cells between old control and 1-4 Gy irradiated mice at any irradiation dose used here (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, functional humoral memory response against the virus assessed in the serum 45 days postvaccination showed no difference in old mice based on the dose of irradiation in youth (Fig. 4B) . This was concluded based upon the analysis of the neutralizing potential of WNV-specific antibodies using a plaque reducing neutralizing titer (PRNT) assay. While adult vaccinated mice showed on average 40-fold higher PRNT titers compared with old nonirradiated counterparts, similar to our original observations (Uhrlaub et al., 2011) , WBI dose in youth did not significantly alter the neutralizing potential of serum antibody generated by RWN vaccination in old mice (Fig. 4A) . Finally, 45 days postvaccination, PBMCs were harvested and stimulated with WNV peptides recognized by CD8 T cells in the presence of Brefeldin A to evaluate the function of memory CD8+ cells (Fig. 4C,D) . No significant differences were noted across WBI doses with regard to individual cytokine production (Fig. 4C) , although Granzyme B levels exhibited a trend toward reduction at the highest irradiation dose (4 Gy). Similarly, percentages of cells producing multiple cytokines (polyfunctional cytokine production) mounted against WNVspecific peptides were not different between the groups (Fig. 4D ).",

            "text": "In this report, we have systematically and longitudinally studied the impact in mice of early-life exposure to sublethal WBI upon immune repopulation, homeostasis, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal challenge in the old age. The obtained results were exceedingly consistent and clear, and we conclude that a single, widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in haematopoietic cells does not lead to increased aging immune phenotypes in mice. Because WBI applies DNA damage to both immune and nonimmune cells, our experimental design theoretically addresses both direct and systemic relationships between DNA damage and immune aging. Although increased unrepaired DNA damage correlates with aging in some hematopoietic populations (Nijnik et al., 2007) , and DNA damage can cause senescence and inflammation in a variety of cell types (Rodier et al., 2009; Chandler & Peters, 2013) , no immune aging effect was replicated by WBI alone in the present studies. There are several possible not mutually exclusive explanations for this observation. These are: (i) that the sum total of DNA damage is not a cause of immune aging, (ii) that the youthful capacity of DNA repair and apoptotic mechanisms are able to repair and nullify even severe DNA damage in early life, or (iii) that the response to gradual DNA damage that occurs over lifespan is fundamentally different than the response to DNA damage delivered by a single dose of WBI, and that only the former is of importance during aging. Experimental analysis with repeated, lowlevel exposure to DNA damage will be necessary to test and distinguish between these hypotheses. Some recent studies have used WBI as a model for aging in mice (Shao et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2016) . These studies document similarities in HSC senescence between natural aging and WBI in youth, among other nonimmune phenotypes. Unfortunately, neither group tested immune function nor challenged reconstituted immune systems in vivo. Both studies employ higher doses of WBI than in our present study, in conjunction with HSC transfer models, reconstituting irradiated HSCs in lethally irradiated hosts. While this model is necessary for the focused study of HSCs, it unfortunately adds many confounding covariables to a direct comparison between natural immune aging and WBI exposure. For instance, we observed strong peripheral immune cell division and reconstitution in our model, even in Na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells (Fig. S4) , which would not be present in an HSC transfer model. Indeed, this factor may have led to irradiated populations having slightly higher counts of Na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells in old age (Fig. 2) . Taken together with our results, this suggests that WBI, although able to replicate senescence in HSCs and some nonimmune cell types, fails to additively impact other systemic immune aging phenotypes. A combination of HSC reconstitution and in vivo challenge models will be necessary in future studies to resolve some of the remaining issues. Older individuals exhibit dampened primary effector responses to vaccination (rev. in. Nikolich-Zugich, 2014) . This age-related defect in generating effector immunity was recapitulated in our experiments following R-WN vaccination. However, the response to vaccine by old na\u20ac \u0131ve NS4b+ cells was not further degraded by WBI up to 4 Gy. We did not note any increase in standing DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes following repopulation (Fig. S3A) , implying that either the surviving precursor cells with DNA damage were not contributing to repopulation, or that DNA damage was adequately neutralized through division/ differentiation and apoptosis. We independently examined the increase in standing DNA damage by cH2AX in peripheral immune cells with age. No CD8 T-cell subset exhibited increased standing dsDNA breaks with age ( Fig. S3B) , implying that standing DNA damage is not a major intrinsic factor in T-cell aging defects, at least not within the limits of our experimental design and detection sensitivity. Taken together, this implies that DNA repair mechanisms in hematopoietic cells, combined with culling of damaged cells through apoptosis, are adequate to overcome both lifetime DNA damage and proliferation stress and a single, whole-body extensive DNA damage event in specific pathogen-free mice.",
