This has therapeutic concern and such knowledge is also required for prudent use of antimicrobials. Methods: In a case control study Esherichia coli isolated from faecal samples from dairy calves were phenotyped by biochemical fingerprinting and analyzed for virulence genes by PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Farm management data were collected and Fisher's exact test and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed.",

            "text": "Of 95 E. coli tested for antimicrobial susceptibility 61% were resistant to one or more substances and 28% were multi-resistant. The virulence gene F5 (K99) was not found in any isolate. In total, 21 out of 40 of the investigated virulence genes were not detected or rarely detected. The virulence genes espP, irp, and fyuA were more common in resistant E. coli than in fully susceptible isolates (P < 0.05). The virulence gene terZ was associated with calf diarrhea (P \u2264 0.01). The participating 85 herds had a median herd size of 80 lactating cows. Herds with calf diarrhea problems were larger (> 55 cows; P < 0.001), had higher calf mortality (P \u2264 0.01) and calf group feeders were more in use (P > 0.05), compared to herds without calf diarrhea problems. There was no association between calf diarrhea and diversity of enteric E. coli. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance was common in E. coli from pre-weaned dairy calves, occurring particularly in calves from herds experiencing calf diarrhea problems. The results indicate that more factors than use of antimicrobials influence the epidemiology of resistant E. coli. Enteropathogenic E. coli seems to be an uncommon cause of neonatal calf diarrhea in Swedish dairy herds. In practice, calf diarrhea should be regarded holistically in a context of infectious agents, calf immunity, management practices etc. We therefore advice against routine antimicrobial treatment and recommend that bacteriological cultures, followed by testing for antimicrobial susceptibility and for virulence factors, are used to guide decisions on such treatment.",

Enteric colibacillosis is manifested primarily by varying degrees of diarrhoea and dehydration and the outcome may be fatal. The major virulence factors of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli in NCD are the F5 (K99) adhesion antigen and also the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) [6] . Under Swedish conditions, E. coli is of practitioner's concern from a therapeutic perspective. In most cases of NCD in Swedish dairy calves antimicrobial therapy is not indicated since most enteric E. coli strains from calves are non pathogenic [7] . However, for treatment of enteritis caused by enteropathogenic E. coli, or of E. coli bacteraemia secondary to enteritis, antimicrobials given orally or systemically are recommended [8] .",

            "text": "As discussed by Call et al. [24] the epidemiology of resistant E. coli in calves is multifactorial, complex and e.g. influenced by co-selection due to linkage of resistance genes. But widespread resistance is fundamentally a consequence of historical and current use of antimicrobials and associations between use of antimicrobials and resistance in enteric E. coli of calves have been documented [19, 20, 22, [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, in the present study resistance is not a direct sequel to antimicrobial use since no calf was treated prior to sampling. Antimicrobial use in calves is still not uncommon in Sweden and Ortman & Svensson [29] showed that in dairy herds Table 3 Results from the univariable logistic regression analysis of variables significantly (P \u2264 0.20) associated with Escherichia coli isolates (n = 95) with or without antimicrobial resistance (from 95 healthy or diarrheic calves from 85 Swedish dairy herds). about one third of diarrhoeic calves (1-90 days) were treated with trimethoprim/sulfa, enrofloxacin or other antimicrobials. Also in the present study NCD was treated with antimicrobials in several herds but there was no statistical association between such routines and resistance. Although the total use of antimicrobials in the herds is unknown, the absence of association indicates that the high prevalence of resistance is not solely an effect of a direct selection pressure by use of antimicrobials to the calves. Importance of other aspects than antimicrobial use on prevalence of resistant E. coli in preweaned calves is indicated by several studies [17, [20] [21] [22] 26, 28, 30] and was recently reviewed by Call et al. [24] . One proposed factor is a linkage between resistance genes and genes conferring selective advantage to colonize the intestinal lumen of calves. Walk et al. [28] hypothesized that, regardless of use of antimicrobials, tetracycline resistance in E. coli is co-selected in calves by an unknown \"beneficial mutation\". Likewise, Khachatryan et al. [21, 30] showed that E. coli with the resistance phenotype streptomycin -sulfonamide -tetracycline have a selective advantage to colonize the intestine of calves given a dietary milk supplement also in absence of antimicrobials. Notably, in the present study about one third of the resistant isolates and two thirds of the multiresistant isolates had streptomycin -sulfonamide -tetracycline in their phenotype.",

Also multivariate analysis showed that resistance to tetracycline in E. coli was associated with diarrhea in calves. A higher occurrence of resistance in E. coli in calves from herds experiencing problems with NCD was shown also by Gunn et al. [34] . A plausible reason for this is that antimicrobials are used more often in herds with a high disease incidence, as indicated in the present study by the more common routine of treating NCD with antimicrobials in CD+ herds than in CD-herds. However, a higher prevalence of resistant E. coli in calves with diarrhoea could also be due to linkage between virulence genes and resistance genes as proposed by Martinez & Baquero [35] . Such linkage was demonstrated in E. coli from pigs with diarrhoea [36, 37] and could imply co-selection of virulence genes by use of antimicrobials and conversely maintenance of resistance in populations of pathogenic bacteria as proposed by Boerlin et al. [36] . In the present study phenotypic resistance to one or more antimicrobials was associated with presence of the virulence genes espP, irp or fyuA in E. coli. However, there was no association to single antimicrobials or resistance phenotypes. Moreover, none of these virulence factors were associated with diarrhea and the findings should be interpreted with caution. Likewise, Suojala et al. [38] found an association between the virulence factor iucD and resistance to streptomycin, ampicillin, sulphametoxazole and trimethoprim in E. coli from dairy cows with mastitis, but they found no association between the virulence factor and patogenicity.",

This virulence gene was not found in any isolate in this study and 21 out of 40 of the investigated genes were not detected or rarely detected.

Therefore, biochemical fingerprinting was performed to increase the probability of selecting isolates of the pathogenic strain and thereby the probability of detecting virulence genes. The results in the present study agree with the findings of Acha et al. [39] and could indicate that in calves, there is no predominance of single clones even in diarrhea caused by enteropathogenic E. coli. Still, in the present study it more likely indicates that diarrhea caused by E. coli was uncommon since there, with one exception, was no association between occurrence of virulence genes and diarrhea.",

Other sampling errors were a mismatch in age at sampling between CD+ and CD-calves, and an extended age interval for CD+ and CD-calves (1-135 days, mean 21.9) compared to the criteria (four weeks). Nevertheless, there were clear differences in clinical signs between CD-and CD+ calves and CD-and CD+ herds regarding mortality, occurrence of diarrhea, general appearance and respiratory signs. One contributing reason for this could be that CD+ herds were larger than CD-herds. Larger herds were more likely to have calf group feeder in the present study, and there might be a larger number of neonatal calves in the herd during the same time period which increases the risk for infectious enteric diseases. The association between diarrhea in calves and large herd size agrees with the findings in a recent Swedish study on calf morbidity and mortality in herds with different size (C Sandgren personal communication). The calf mortality in this study was higher than previously reported in Swedish herds [45] which also could reflect a negative impact of large herd size on calf health. Calf rearing practices have changed concurrently with herd size.",
