            "text": "Extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) migration into the decidua is critical for establishing placental perfusion and when dysregulated, may lead to pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; encoded by ABCG2) regulates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from maternally derived xenobiotics. Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation. We report that besides syncitiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, BCRP is also expressed in EVTs. BCRP inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (human EVT-like) cells and in human EVT explant cultures, while not affecting cell proliferation. We have also shown that bacterial-lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-and viral antigens-single stranded RNA (ssRNA)-have a profound effect in downregulating ABCG2 and BCRP levels, whilst simultaneously increasing the migration potential of EVT-like cells. Our study reports a novel function of BCRP in early placentation and suggests that exposure of EVTs to maternal infection/inflammation could disrupt their migration potential via the downregulation of BCRP. This could negatively influence placental development/function, contribute to existing obstetric pathologies, and negatively impact pregnancy outcomes and maternal/neonatal health.",

Conversely, uncontrolled EVT migration/invasion can lead to the deeper penetration of trophoblasts into the myometrium rather than decidua basalis (placenta acreta) [6] or even through the uterus, affecting the surrounding organs (placenta percreta) [7] , resulting in maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality.

Whereas, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) (a double-stranded viral antigen) did not induce changes in BCRP expression [12] . In sharp contrast, the placenta from preterm pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis exhibited increased ABCG2 and BCRP expression [13] .

During early gestation, altered levels of BCRP may affect the migration and invasion potential of these cells, thereby causing pregnancy complications, though to date, no studies have tested this hypothesis. Given the relatively high incidence of bacterial and viral infections during early human pregnancy [19] and its impact on BCRP expression, we determined the role of ABCG2 and BCRP in modulating the migration potential of EVTs, which is critical for the establishment of placentation in early pregnancy. Further, we determined the impact of bacterial (mimicked by LPS) or viral (mimicked by single stranded RNA, ssRNA) infection on these processes.",

Briefly, small clusters of 2 to 3 column cytotrophoblasts (CCT) villi presenting high vascularization and clear white tips were excised under the dissecting microscope. Tips of the villi were cleared to expose CCT stem cells, which were gently spread on the matrigel (200 \u00b5L per insert of phenol red free, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) coated transwell inserts (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) in a 24-well culture plate. Serum free culture medium (400 \u00b5L of DMEM/F12) supplemented with Normacin (1%, Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was added to the wells beneath the inserts to keep the matrigel moist, and explants were allowed to adhere to the Matrigel overnight (37 \u2022 C, 3% O 2 , and 5% CO 2 ) as described earlier [21] . The next day, 200 \u00b5L of medium was added to the inserts and the explants were incubated (for 24 h) to allow the formation of EVT outgrowths. Explant outgrowth was observed under a microscope. Only explants exhibiting EVT sprouting were included in the study. For ABCG2 knockdown, explant media was supplemented with the siABCG2 transfection complexes or scrambled control (50 nmol/L-please see below). Explants were then photographed (at time zero: T0) using a Leica DFC400 camera (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) attached to a dissecting microscope. Photographs were taken after 24 h (T24) and 48 h (T48) post transfection. The area of outgrowth at T0, T24, and T48 was analyzed from the pictographs using imageJ software and percent growth was calculated by dividing the difference between the final (T24 or T48) and initial (T0) area of outgrowth with the final area of outgrowth *100. Each experiment was performed in triplicate with a total of N = 3 first trimester human placentae.",

Since cytokine and chemokine release is the primary systemic response after bacterial or viral infection, we evaluated the LPS and ssRNA inflammatory responses by examining the induction of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2. Both LPS treatments increased the levels of expression of Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA ( Figure 4C ), IL-8 ( Figure 4E ), and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2; Figure 4G ) mRNA. High dose ssRNA treatment increased levels of IL-6 ( Figure 4D ) and IL-8 mRNA ( Figure 4F ) at the high dose whereas CCL2 mRNA expression ( Figure 4H ) remained unchanged after treatment. Similar to mRNA expression, we found a significant decrease in BCRP protein following 12 h exposure to low and high doses of LPS and ssRNA ( Figure 5A,B) . There was also a significant increase in IL-8 levels in the culture media after 12 h exposure to low dose LPS (p < 0.01) and high dose ssRNA (p < 0.001), but no change in IL-6 levels ( Figure 5C-F) .

We report, for the first time, that BCRP, which is well known for its role as an efflux transporter, inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (EVT-like) cells and in first trimester derived EVTs. In addition to being present in STs, BCRP is also expressed in CCTs and EVTs in human placenta during the first trimester, implicating that it has a role in EVT function. Inhibition of BCRP with siABCG2 or Ko143 increased cell migration in the HTR8/SVneo (EVT-like) cell line over 36 h, without affecting proliferation. We also demonstrated that LPS and ssRNA exposure decreased ABCG2 and BCRP expression in EVTs and stimulated EVT migration. Together, these data suggest that BCRP functions as an inhibitor of EVT migration and that infection may lead to increased EVT migration.",

It is important to note that we used a novel automated approach to monitor and analyze the migration of EVT cells. We calculated the % wound density and the area under the curve generated from the data recorded every 2 h over 36 h using IncuCyte\u2122 technology [15] . Pharmacological inhibition of BCRP resulted in a similar outcome. Interestingly, this contrasts with reports from cancer cell lines, which suggest that BCRP increases the migration of glioma and pancreatic cancer cells [16, 17, 30] and inhibits the proliferation in other epithelial-like cancer cell lines [14] . These differences may result from the fact that the cancer cell lines are derived from human tumors, whereas HTR8/SVneo cells are derived from physiological EVTs [23] , thus illustrating different actions of BCRP modulating cell migration in physiological and in neoplastic phenotypes. Further, diverse cancer cells may commonly exhibit increased basal expression of ABCG2 and BCRP, an important mechanism conferring multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [31] . This is postulated to be an adaptation to the rearrangement of intracellular signaling pathways undertaken by malignant cells to promote invasiveness [32] .",

            "text": "In a previous study, we reported that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), another ABC transporter related to ST-mediated fetal protection, reduces HTR8/SVneo cell proliferation and invasion [20] . While the contrasting actions of BCRP and P-gp in early placentation require further investigation, it is attractive to speculate that P-gp drives placentation by enhancing EVT migration/invasion, while BCRP likely controls the extent of EVT penetration within the decidua. The mechanisms by which BCRP modulates EVT migration remains to be determined. BCRP may regulate the transport and activity of substrates which are critical to cell migration (such as extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules). P-gp and BCRP are known to interact with CD44 to modulate cancer cell migration/invasion [33, 34] . It is also possible that P-gp and BCRP have shared mediators controlling EVT cell migration. For example, CD44 and hyaluronic acid (HA) mediate cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion and, hence, affect cell migration [35] [36] [37] , and it is documented that CD44/HA on the cell surface of EVTs are important mediators of EVT invasion [38] . The STRING database of protein-protein interaction indicates interaction between CD44 and BCRP (https://string-db.org/cgi/network.pl?taskId=okGQMLlRXDFw). Based on this, it is possible to speculate that BCRP competes with P-gp for CD44 binding, interferes with the CD44/HA mediated adhesion properties of EVTs, and, hence, impedes EVT migration/invasion. This possibility requires further investigation.",

This pattern of BCRP inhibition is consistent with our previous report showing that ABCG2 and BCRP expression was decreased 24 h after exposure of first trimester human explants to LPS [12] . In the rat, previous studies have shown LPS to down-regulate placental Abcg2 mRNA [40] . No studies have investigated the effect of LPS on BCRP activity, however in mid-gestation, LPS inhibited the P-gp (encoded by Abcb1a and Abcb1b in rodents) efflux transporter in the mouse placenta [41] . Together, these studies suggest that the regulation of placental ABCG2 by LPS is gestational age-dependent.

There are no previous reports of ssRNA modulating placental BCRP expression, though Poly (I:C), a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that acts via TLR-3 activation [42] , has been shown to decrease ABCG2 in third trimester human placental explants [12] and in the late gestation rat placenta [40] . No studies have assessed the effect of Poly (I:C) on BCRP function. However, Poly (I:C) inhibited P-gp activity in the fetal mouse blood-brain barrier, but did not alter placental P-gp function [43] , suggesting that the effects of dsRNA viral infection on P-gp mediated fetal protection are tissue barrier dependent.

In the present study, we showed that infection with ssRNA (which also include influenza (flu virus), rhinovirus (common cold virus), retrovirus (HIV and HTLV1), and coronavirus (upper-respiratory illnesses virus)) (Potter et al. 2015; Luo et al. 2018 ) in early-pregnancy has the potential to disrupt normal EVT migration and ultimately placentation, placental function, and fetal development. In this context, human placentae infected by ZIKV exhibit marked villous immaturity and increased the ratio of syncytial sprouts (syncytial nuclei aggregation at the outer trophoblastic wall) [48, 49] . This provides pathological evidence of uteroplacental malperfusion, typically associated with deranged EVT migration into the decidualized endometrium, resulting in poor myometrial spiral arteries remodeling and reperfusion [50] .
