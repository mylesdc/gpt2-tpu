Due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing SEDs from some patients, producing SEDs from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity. A major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission. We therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of SEDs to resolve DES in a rabbit model. Sera prepared from the blood of five rabbits were pooled and divided into two subpools. One was untreated (SEDs), while the other was virally-inactivated with 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 at 31\u00b0C for 1 h (S/D-SEDs). DES was induced in rabbits using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Rabbits were divided into five groups of two rabbits each. One group was untreated (control), three were treated twice daily for 3 weeks using PBS, SEDs, or S/D-SEDs, and the last received an additional 0.1% BAC (as the negative control). The DES condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion (Schirmer's test), corneal fluorescein staining, a corneal histologic examination, TUNEL stain apoptosis, and corneal inflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-6) expressions. We first confirmed that SEDs and S/D-SEDs had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 contents. Animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the SED and S/D-SED groups but was significantly higher than in the PBS group. Eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs, and hematoxylin/ eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls. Inflammatory markers and TUNEL studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs. In conclusion, this preclinical study supports the possibility of using S/D virally inactivated SEDs to treat DES and restore a normal epithelium. 3 / 14 different treatments.

DES can lead to inflammation of the ocular surface, damage to the cornea, and conjunctiva, thereby impacting visual function and affecting the quality of life. DES has a prevalence of 5% to >35%, which increases with age [1, 2] . Its severity is worsened by pathological conditions such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which induces disruption of the ocular surface epithelium [3] , or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [4] . Regular use of artificial tears, anti-inflammatory drops, or punctal plugs can provide release, that is, however, only temporary and often induces ocular side effects.",

However, preparing autologous serum requires particular attention and repeated blood samplings from patients, which is a constraint, and thus is potentially impossible in some clinical situations where patients are not in a condition or willing to donate blood. When an autologous source is unavailable, allogeneic serum, made from the serum of blood transfusion donors, is the next obvious option that in therapeutic terms appears equally efficient as autologous SEDs [16] [17] [18] . Allogeneic serum can be prepared by some blood establishments in a production setting that should comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP) principles [19, 20] , to ensure product standardization and quality [20] . The other substantial advantage of allogeneic SED is its off-the-shelf availability.",

Although there is no data available indicating the extent of the possible infectious risks associated with the use of allogeneic topical SEDs, viral safety strategies of all therapeutic blood products should involve careful donor screening and blood donation testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis B and C viruses [21] . However, information from the transfusion of intravenous blood components indicates that these measures do not prevent residual risks from infectious window-phase donations, when screening tests are not reactive but the donor is actually infectious. In addition, the blood supply is regularly exposed to emerging viruses, such as Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus that can be transmitted by blood products [22] . Currently, a higher margin of safety of blood components against a wide range of viruses can only be achieved by implementing dedicated virus pathogen inactivation treatments [23] . Treatments based on photochemical pathogen virus inactivation have recently been developed for plasma and platelet blood components [24] , but not for serum. Their proprietary nature restricts their evaluation of new products like SEDs. In contrast, solvent-detergent (S/D) treatment that was developed in the late 1980s is in the public domain. S/D treatment is already applied to a wide range of biopharmaceutical preparations and plasma products, and is highly efficient against lipid-enveloped viruses [21] . We report here for the first time application of S/D treatment to the viral inactivation of SEDs. We also compared the safety and efficacy of S/ D-treated and untreated rabbit SEDs in a DES rabbit model to determine whether S/D treatment is a realistic, safe option for viral inactivation of allogeneic SEDs.

Higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 were detected in the 0.1% BAC (DES)-treated group, as expected, since this model mimics inflammatory conditions associated with DES ( \u00c3 p<0.05). Concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly reduced in the SED-and S/D-SED-treated groups compared to the DES group ( # p<0.05). The concentration of IL-8 in inflamed corneas treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs was higher than that in the normal control group but lower than that of the DES-treated one, evidencing only partial relief of the inflammatory conditions. The IL-6 concentration in all groups was much higher than that in normal corneas. Therefore, according to these results, using SEDs or S/D-SEDs for topical delivery to treat DES rabbits could selectively inhibit inflammatory cytokines in the eyes.",

            "text": "DES is a frequent disorder prevalent in the elderly and in patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [3] or chronic GVHD [4] . DES symptoms include pain, irritation, itching, burning, and grittiness which all have serious adverse impacts on daily life activities [34, 35] . In addition, DES is associated with inflammation of the ocular surface [31, 36, 37] . Artificial tears, anti-inflammatory drops, and punctal plugs are conventional treatments, but they provide only partial benefits in addition of having side effects. Eye drops made of human serum have emerged as an alternative and probably superior treatment of DES [6, 11, 38, 39] . SED preparations from autologous sources have so far been used most frequently [5, 6, 14, 15] , and standardized preparation procedures using a closed cascade filtration system were developed [40] . However, there is a trend towards using allogeneic, off-the-shelf SEDs prepared under controlled GMP conditions by blood establishments [20, 41] . Still, a legitimate concern associated with the use of allogeneic SEDs is the risk of viral contamination. Although donor screening and donation testing can provide a high viral safety margin, risks are not completely eliminated, even in developed economies with access to the most efficient nucleic acid viral testing procedures, due to residual window-phase donations of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [42, 43] . In addition, world populations, due to increasing travel and migration and global warming, are regularly exposed to new emerging viruses [44] . Such viruses, when collected from asymptomatic blood donors and untested, could potentially be transmitted to SED recipients, although the extent of the risks of viral infections is still currently unknown. It has been shown, for instance, that respiratory syncytial virus can use the eye as an entry pathway, replicate robustly, and eventually migrate to the lung [45] . Thus, optimal viral safety of allogeneic SEDs requires implementation of additional safety measures such as dedicated pathogen inactivation treatment implemented by manufacturers. Among pathogen-inactivation procedures theoretically applicable to SEDs, S/D was selected here for SED as it is very efficient against lipid-enveloped viruses [46] , which represent major threats to the safety of blood-derived products. We therefore evaluated S/D treatment as a possible tool to enhance the safety of SEDs. We elected to treat SEDs with a combination of 1% TnBP and 1% Triton X-45 at 31\u00b0C. These conditions applied to plasma and cryoprecipitates are known to inactivate, within a few minutes, over 5 log of HIV, porcine pseudorabies, bovine viral diarrhea virus [47] , hepatitis C virus [48] , and Dengue virus [49] . S/D treatment affects viruses by disrupting their lipid envelope, not by removal. It can also inactivate some bacteria [50] as well as parasites and white blood cells. Such S/D treatment does not alter the plasma protein functionality or content, including albumin [47] , which was shown to contribute to apoptosis suppression of ocular epithelium cells in a dry-eye model [51] . In addition, and quite importantly, this S/D treatment was shown not to alter the antimicrobial [50] or anti-inflammatory [52] activities of plasma components. We showed that the procedure based on soybean oil extraction and C18 hydrophobic interaction chromatography efficiently removes S/D agents [53, 54] thereby avoiding toxicity. Therefore, this treatment is capable of providing a high safety margin against lipid-enveloped viruses without impairing key functional features of SEDs. There is, however, some quantitative loss of proteins associated with the S/D treatment steps, in particular the oil extraction and the C18 adsorption.",

The large ocular surface of the rabbit eye permits adequate monitoring of tear production and more-efficient histological and biochemical analyses compared to mice [59] . Our animal model was inspired by previously published methods [29] but was modified by exposing the eyes to 0.1% BAC three times daily for 4 weeks followed by 3-week treatment with 0.1% BAC or SEDs, resulting in a stable DES state that did not spontaneously recover after discontinuing BAC [30] . Our results demonstrated that pathogen inactivation did not impair the efficacy of SEDs to relieve DES symptoms in this rabbit model based on the following relevant evaluation criteria: restoration of tear production, FL staining observations, histological examinations, and quantification of inflammatory markers.",
