A total of 2849 proteins are identified, including 95 that are differentially expressed. Among them, 26 proteins are located on the membrane. The most differentially expressed proteins are involved in response to stimulus, metabolic process, and immune system process, which mainly have the function of binding and catalytic activity. Cluster of differentiation CD163, vimentin (VIM), and nmII as well as detected proteins are assessed together by string analysis, which elucidated a potentially different infection mechanism. According to the function annotations, PRRSV with different virulence may mainly differ in immunology, inflammation, immune evasion as well as cell apoptosis. This is the first attempt to explore the differential characteristics between HP-PRRSV and its attenuated PRRSV infected PAMs focusing on membrane proteins which will be of great help to further understand the different infective mechanisms of HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been a leading economically significant viral pathogen of swine worldwide for almost 28 years. [1] [2] [3] PRRSV, equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus are members of the family Arteriviridae. [4, 5] PRRSV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus with a full-length genome of 15 kb that has a 5 cap and a 3 poly (A) tail. [4, [6] [7] [8] PRRSV was first reported in the United States in the late 1980s. [9] In 2006, several large-scale, severe outbreaks of highly pathogenic (HP) atypical PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) were reported in China and neighboring Asian countries. [2, 3, 10] Reported HP-PRRSV morbidity and mortality rates were much higher than previous pandemic PRRSV strains and associated with more severe clinical presentations and higher rectal temperature (>41\u00b0C). [11] The emergence of HP-PRRSV has caused great economic loss to the swine industry in China and made preventing and controlling PRRSV outbreaks difficult. Therefore, elucidating the causes of the greater virulence of PRRSV and the differences between the HP and attenuated pathogenic (AP) strains has become even more important. To this end, several trials have been conducted to identify virulence factors; these studies have resulted in some successes. [12, 13] However, changes in virulence and pathogenic mechanisms are difficult to discern. Other than virulence in vivo, many distinctions in the biological aspects of HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV have been noted, such as in viral binding and entry into pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). PRRSV exhibits highly restricted cell tropism both in vivo and in vitro. [14] The virus can be detected only in well-differentiated macrophages of lungs, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, spleen, tonsils, and thymus. PAMs are the main target cells of PRRSV. [15] PRRSV can also replicate in vitro in the African www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com",

Ninety-five differentially expressed proteins were identified and characterized. The most significant difference in the biological process between PAMs infected with HP-and AP-PRRSV is the metabolic process. Most different molecular functions were classified as binding and catalytic activities. Cellular component categories showed that 26 differentially expressed proteins were confirmed as MPs based on the annotation of UniProt database, such as RAP2A, VCL (Vinculin), IFITM3 function in cell-cell junctions, ERK signaling pathway, G protein signaling pathways, biotic stimulus, and so on. Among them, VCL is a kind of F-actin-binding protein which is involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion in humans. It was demonstrated that over expression of VCL could inhibit the replication of both HP-PRRSV and the attenuated PRRSV in the mRNA level. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP-PRRSV and its attenuated strain. This is the first attempt to explore the differential characteristics between HP-PRRSV and its attenuated PRRSV-infected PAMs focusing on MPs which will be of great help to further understand the different infective mechanisms of HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV.",

[16, 17] Reportedly, PRRSV targets cellular membrane proteins (MPs) and enters target cells through receptormediated endocytosis during viral infection. [18] Studies have investigated possible mechanisms employed by PRRSV to infect PAMs. [19] Elucidating the characteristics of viruses and interactions between viruses and host cells is increasingly important. However, exploring individual proteins within the many proteins in cells is difficult. Nonetheless, gradual advancements have come through use of proteomic techniques. Of these, MS-based quantitative proteomic techniques offer the advantage of better accuracy and sensitivity, and have been widely used to analyze host cell responses to viral infection. Among them, liquid chromatographytandem MS (LC-MS/MS) for label-free quantitative proteomics (LFQP) is an important mass spectrometric tool to detect and quantify large amounts of proteins. [20] Compared with quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling such as stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, LFQP detects greater amounts of proteins and important signaling pathways and networks. The aim of this study was to determine potentially different infection mechanisms used by the HP strain vHuN4 [10] and its derivative attenuated strain vHuN4-F112 [21, 22] using LFQP.",

            "text": "A heatmap based on the UniProt database was constructed to comprehend the functions and BPs of differently expressed proteins ( Figure 8B) , which revealed clustering and abundance of the 26 detected proteins that existed confidentially on the membrane based on UniProt database annotation. We first focused on proteins associated with immunology and inflammation with higher abundance in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs. PTPN2 (vH/vA = 0.419), a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, functions as signaling molecule that regulates cellular processes related to the Jak-STAT, IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathways; dephosphorylation of nonreceptor kinases including JAK1, JAK3, STAT3, and STAT6; and negative regulation of IL-2-, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-mediated signaling. PTPN2 also functions in the response to inflammation via NF-\u03baB. [32] [33] [34] SIPA1 (H-/A+) is a mitogen-induced GT-Pase activating protein for Ras-related regulatory proteins. It was related to G-protein signaling and blood-brain barrier and immune cell transmigration: VCAM01/CD106 (cluster of differentiation) signaling pathways. [35, 36] C5AR1 (H-/A+) is the receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C5a, which stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release, and superoxide anion production, participates in the innate and adaptive immune responses to www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com Table 3 . Statistics analysis of proteins that existed definitely on the membrane. the lectin-induced complement pathway. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Polyribonucleotide 5 -hydroxyl-kinase Clp1 (CLP1) (vH/vA = 0.136) mainly acts as a kinase that binds ATP hosting 5 -hydroxyl-kinase activity, and functions in mRNA cleavage and in siRNA loading onto the RNAinduced silencing complex involved in RNA interference and its destruction. The kinase hClp1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to assemble into an RNA-induced silencing complex for cleavage of target RNA. [43] Expression of these molecules was higher in the AP-PRRSV-infected group and had a similar level to the control group. Therefore, we concluded that they might be related to the immune escape of HP-PRRSV and that the attenuated vaccine strain would not have side effects on these immune factors expression in the host cell, and these proteins above would contribute to the resistance of PRRSV. Some proteins related to immunology and inflammation had higher expression in HP-PRRSV-infected cells. Raftlin (vH/vA = 2.554) protein is pivotal for maintenance of lipid rafts and may be involved in regulation of B-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling. Raftlin promotes binding of double-stranded RNA, activations of B cell receptors and toll-like receptor 3 signaling pathways, and is involved in IL-17 production to release proinflammatory cytokines. Hence, the higher abundance of raftlin in the HP-PRRSV group compared to the AP-PRRSV and control groups may explain the more severe inflammation triggered by HP-PRRSV. [44, 45] IARS (H+/A-), Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is a target of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases. [46, 47] VCL (H+/A-), Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cellcell and cell-matrix junctions, and is related to the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF signaling pathways. [48] RAP2A (H+/A-) is a member of the Ras oncogene family, small GTP-binding protein, of which active form interacts with several effectors [49] [50] [51] related to the ERK and G protein signaling pathways. [52, 53] It was reported that PRRSV could induces prostaglandin E2 production through cyclooxygenase 1 and is related to ERK signaling. [54] The differential expression of RAP2A may provide information for future research on the interaction between PRRSV and the ERK signaling pathway. The abundance of RAP2A was lower in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs than in HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs and control cells, which had similar levels. Thus, we hypothesized that RAP2A was associated with immunization with the attenuated vaccine. IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3, IFITM3 (vH/vA = 2.861), responds to biotic stimulus and had the highest expression levels among these proteins in the HP-PRRSV group, as compared to the proteins identified in the AP-PRRSV group but it was not detected in the control group. In humans, this protein negatively regulates the entry of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into host cells. [55, 56] It could inhibit hemagglutinin protein -mediated entry of influenza virus, GP1, two-mediated viral entry of Marburg virus and Ebola virus, S protein-mediated viral entry of SARS coronavirus, and G protein-mediated viral entry of VSV, thereby playing a critical role in the structural stability and function of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase). Establishing physical contact with the v-ATPase of endosomes is critical for proper clathrin localization and is required for v-ATPase to lower the pH in phagocytic endosomes, thus establishing an antiviral state. [57] High expression of both HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV suggests that IFITM3 may help inhibit PRRSV entry and promote resistance to HP-PRRSV infection. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB, vH/vA = 0.406) has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and is involved in protein folding and protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization, which can accelerate protein folding. [58] PPIB is positively regulated by viral genome replication, is involved with the viral processes of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and interacts with and stimulates the RNA-binding activity of HCV NS5B. PPIB is critical for efficient replication of the HCV genome. [59] Compared with the control group, PPIB was downregulated in the HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV groups. The abundance of PPIB was lower in the HP-PRRSV group than the AP-PRRSV group, suggesting an association with PRRSV replication.",

The essential factors and receptors involved in the entry of PRRSV are reportedly CD163 (Q2VL90), nmHC II-A (MYH9, F1SKJ1), sialoadhesin (SN, A7LCJ3), CD151 (F1RYZ1), and vimentin (VIM) (P02543). [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] We assessed the involvement of these MPs together with proteins detected by string analysis on viral entry. Receptor proteins involved in PRRSV entry are in Figure 9 To better understand the characteristics of pathway-like regions, the GenomRNAi database was analyzed to annotate detected proteins. [66] Regions containing proteins with higher abundance in HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs are green and in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs are red ( Figure 9A) . A search of the GenomRNAi database determined that linked proteins IK (IK cytokine), WD repeat domain 12, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) in the green region of Figure 9A shared similar annotations and functioned to decrease expression of NF-\u03baB or IL-8, [67] which are related to inflammation. [44, 45] Hence, further analysis of these linked proteins may help explain differential mechanisms between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV infection. Other proteins in the green-colored region of 9A are reported to influence virus infection. Nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 increases Sindbis virus infection [68] and ADSL increases human papilloma virus 16-GFP infection. [69] The lower abundance of nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein and ADSL in the HP-PRRSV-infected group may be related to the host immune response repression of PRRSV and may be used by HP-PRRSV during infection to self-upregulate.

Uridine monophosphate synthetase decreases HIV-1 infection, [70] while programmed cell death 5 decreases HCV replication, [71] both downregulate NF-\u03baB expression. [67] The lower abundance of these proteins in the HP-PRRSV group suggested that HP-PRRSV escaped inhibition through an unknown mechanism. Myosin-9 (MYH9) appears to function in cytokinesis, cell shape, and specialized functions such as secretion and capping. [72] MYH9 is an important factor for PRRSV infection and interacts with GP5 of PRRSV, [65] although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear because of limited research. As shown by our results, MYH9 was related to VCL in AP-PRRSV and ACTL6 in HP-PRRSV. VCL is an actin filament (F-actin)binding protein involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion in humans, regulation of cell-surface E-cadherin expression, and potentiation of mechanosensing, and may be important in cell morphology and locomotion by promoting binding with actin, alpha-catenin, cadherin, dystroglycan, and ubiquitin protein ligase. [73] In HIV research, transient overexpression of VCL reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with HIV-1 and negatively affected paxillin phosphorylation and limited retroviral infection. [74] Just like HIV-1, in our study, it was demonstrated that over expression of VCL could inhibit the replication of both HP-PRRSV and the attenuated PRRSV in the mRNA level. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP-PRRSV and its attenuated strain. ACTL6A, which is an actin-like protein 6A, is involved in transcriptional www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology) and mainly functions in chromatin binding and transcription coactivator activities. [75] We found that MYH9 may regulate AP-PRRSV and HP-PRRSV infection via different pathways. Through Super Pathways annotation (www.genecards.org), VCL and ACTL6A were identified as participants in the IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, where they may help with differential mechanisms of PRRSV infection with different virulence.",
