Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/ 44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length \u2264 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/ 50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4).",

The prevalence and diversity of BtCoVs in Thailand has been studied in the last decade [17, 19, 20] . CoVs were found in 11 insectivorous bat species and in 2 frugivorous bat species. However, data from Pteropus bats have been lacking despite Pteropus being the biggest colony of Pteropodidae in Thailand. Three species (P. lylei, P. vampyrus and P. hypomelanus) are reservoirs of Nipah virus (NiV) in Thailand [21] . The prevalence of NiV RNA in urine of P. lylei has been seasonally detected during the months of May and June [22] . P. lylei (Lyle's flying fox (LFF)) ranges from Yunnan in China, and extends to Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam [23] . Up to 20 colonies have been identified in Thailand [24] and the largest known colony comprises of about 10,000 individuals [22] . It shares foraging areas with other frugivorous bats in fruit trees, from which the fruits are also shared by humans. Moreover, trees in populated temple grounds and cultivated land are common roosting sites for LFF. Thus, consumption of partially eaten fruit, uncooked meat, or contact with saliva, urine or faeces, which can be contaminated with bat viruses, poses a risk of viral transmission from LFF to humans or domestic animals.",

Bat rectal swabs were collected monthly from their roosting area and from two human dwellings (foraging sites) nearby. Individual bats were weighed and forearm (FA) lengths were measured for further characterization on its body composition index (BCI).

Sampling was carried out under protocols approved and permitted by the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Thailand (No. 0909.204/2686) and the Animal Use Protocol No.1473001 approved by Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee.",

The \u03b2CoVs from this study clustered in the same clade and shared 95.5-100% nucleotide identity with each other (98.3-100% identity of 118 amino acids). Two individual bats (BRT55709 and BRT55734) were found to be coinfected with multiple strains of the same \u03b2CoV species (difference of 1-2 amino acids). These viruses had amino acids differing from the HKU9 BtCoV, group D \u03b2CoV reference strain by 11.7-14.2%. They formed a different clade to other CoVs from the same bat genus (Pteropus) from Madagascar's P. rufus (Fig. 4b) . However, they were in the same clade with CoVs from different bat species captured at the same site with this study; Cynopterus sphinx, Scotophilus heathii, and Scotophilus kuhlii (Genbank accession numbers KJ868722, KJ020607, KJ020608, respectively) [17] .",

One fourth of bats were juvenile, and 59.9% were male. The ratios between captured juvenile and adult bats were different at the bat roost and foraging sites. Only 13% of juvenile (30/224) bats were captured at the bat roost in the year of the study, whereas half of the juvenile bats were captured from both foraging sites (24/44, 49/99, from S1 and S2 respectively). The maximum linear distances between roosts and foraging areas of LFF at this site varied from 2.2-22.3 km [30] . Foraging sites near roost, even with limited food sources, may be practical for young or unhealthy bats that are unable to fly far. Fig. 4 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of coronavirus (CoV) generated using 357 (a-Bat CoVs) and 299 (b-Lineage D \u03b2CoVs) nucleotides of the RdRp gene sequences of CoVs from Thailand; in LFF (this study-blue), other bat species from previous study in Thailand [15] CoV RNA was detected in approximately 18% of all bats sampled, which is in the same range as the study in China (16%, [31] ; 15.8%, [32] ), and Germany (9.8%, [33] ). The prevalence of CoV infection in Pteropus bats (P. rufus) from Madagascar was similar to this study (17.1%, 13/76) [12] . On the other hand, the prevalence in this study was higher than the two previous studies in Thailand by Wacharapluesadee et al. (6.7%, 47/626) [17] and Gouilh et al. (10.5%, 28/265) [20] . This may be the result of a bias from the cross sectional study of these two previous studies or an indication of difference in prevalence rate in different bat species.",

These findings support the hypothesis that young bats may be more susceptible to CoV infection, and serves to propagate and play an important role in maintaining the virus within bat colonies.

Another possibility is that the unweaned bats acquired infection from contaminated secretion of other bats hanging from the same tree. However, the study by Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008 [33] , where 54 of 178 (30%) of studied female bats were lactating, found higher rate of CoV infection in lactating bats (22.4%) than in non-lactating bats (9.7%) which supports the first scenario.

            "text": "Our study found that CoV transmission in LFF occurred throughout the year at a baseline level, and the months surrounding the birthing season (May-August) represented times of increased infection among juveniles. The CoV prevalence in LFF related mostly to the age of bat rather than location, sex or season. The interspecies transmission of CoV among different bat genus or family demonstrated the possibility of spillover and the potential for emergence of zoonotic viruses into the human population. This data provides the first long-term monitoring of CoV circulation in nature and identifies ecological drivers. The relationship between animal age and infectivity to other bat species should be further investigated to confirm this phenomenon. Additional studies on CoV diversity among Pteropus bat species in Thailand and neighbouring countries, as well as aspects of the virus-host interaction are needed to understand the origins, evolution, maintenance patterns, dispersal and zoonotic potential of CoV across the region.
