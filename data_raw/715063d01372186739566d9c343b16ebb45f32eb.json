Only partial CanineCV sequences were obtained by NGS analysis. Additional sequences were obtained using conventional PCR strategies based on primers designed from the NGS output sequences. The resulting consensus sequences represented ~92% of the complete CanineCV genome and confirmed the detection of this virus in both dogs, with the two strains named CanineCV_14P105D/TH2016 (accession no. MG737378) and CanineCV_14P112N/TH2016 (accession no. MG737386), respectively.

All other tissue samples including lung, liver, spleen, intestine and kidney from all three animals were negative for CanineCV by in situ hybridization. Table S1 ). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the majority of the CanineCV's TH/2016 were divergent to most CanineCV's and were most closely related to CanineCV UCD3-478 ( Fig. 2A) . The individual Rep and Cap genes were used to construct additional phylogenetic trees, revealing that CanineCV's detected in Thailand clustered with CanineCV UCD3-478 for both Cap and Rep genes. However, the phylogenetic trees obtained revealed discrepant patterns among genes by showing distinct and divergent homologous clade of the Rep gene, compared to the Cap gene ( Fig. 2B ,C). All of the CanineCV's-TH/2016, except CanineCV CP191_TH/2016, were identified as recombinants using the RDP4 software. The recombination events in these strains were supported by a number of statistical measurement recombination assays including RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, Maxchi, Chimaera, SiScan, 3Seq and LARD at average p-value = 1.42 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Among these viruses, CanineCV's UCD3-478 and JZ98/2014 were identified as major and minor parents, respectively. The results obtained from RDP analysis were further analyzed to identify potential recombination breakpoints using SIMPLOT software, which also indicated that CanineCV's TH/2016 (except the CP191 strain) were recombinants. The similarity generated plot for CanineCV's TH/2016 revealed that these strains had high nucleotide identity to a CanineCV UCD3-478 (pink line) in the initial Rep gene region and a region of the Cap gene. The CanineCV TH/2016 genomes also showed obvious nucleotide similarity to the CanineCV JZ98/2014 strain (blue line) in the middle portion of Rep gene (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, bootscan analysis confirmed the disparities observed in phylogenetic analyses of CanineCV's TH/2016. The putative recombination breakpoint of the CanineCV's TH/2016 that contained sequences derived from CanineCV JZ98/2014 was nt 380 to nt 820, within the Rep gene. CanineCV UCD3-478 served as a parental template for the Cap gene (Fig. 3B ). Table 2 . The genetic markers were identified by nucleotide marker positions starting from nt 383 through nt 807 in the CanineCV 14P105D TH/2016 (green shading), which was derived from CanineCV JZ98/2014. This analysis also confirmed the predicted nucleotide recombination break points as shown in RDP and SIMPLOT analyses and was useful to corroborate the site of genetic recombination. Moreover, CanineCV CP191 TH/2016 was also analyzed and it was shown to be most likely recombined with CanineCV JZ98/2014. However, mutant nucleotides were detected in nt 333, which were thus far only observed previously in two Italian CanineCV strains (AZ4133/1, accession no. KT734815 and AZ4133/2, accession no. KT734827).",

Partial CanineCV genome sequences were detected by NGS and PCR of lung and swab samples respectively. However, the CanineCV specific ISH was positive only in macrophages present in tracheobronchial lymph nodes and tonsils of one dog. The demonstration of CanineCV in lungs and other organs by NGS and PCR, in the absence of CanineCV ISH signal outside the lymphoid tissues, was consistent with hematogenous spread of CanineCV's TH/2016. Similar findings of PCR-positive but ISH-negative tests in CanineCV-infected dogs were also recently documented 8 .

It was shown that these clustered into two distinct lineages. The majority of CanineCV's in Thailand represented a lineage that also contained the closely related CanineCV UCD3-478 from the USA 8 . However, CanineCV CP191/TH2016 was most closely related to CanineCV JZ98/2014, from China. Surprisingly, pairwise distance analysis of CanineCV's from Thailand showed at least 10.5% genetic difference from a previously characterized and related virus even though they were all present in the same lineage, thus suggesting the detection of novel strains of CanineCV in this study. Preliminary analysis of CanineCV's detected in Thailand revealed discordant phylogenetic relationship with other CanineCV's. For instance, the CanineCV's TH2016 clustered with CanineCV UCD3-478 when compared by analysis of complete genomes and Cap genes. However, they differentially clustered within a new lineage together with the CanineCV UCD3-478 strain when the phylogenetic tree was based on analysis of the Rep gene. Such paradoxical results indicate recombination events during CanineCV TH/2016 evolution. Therefore, we used boot scanning, phylogenetic incongruity, genetic marker identifications and additional sequence analyses to detect recombination events that may have occurred in circulating CanineCV's, enabling the identification of recombination breakpoints occurring in putative recombinant CanineCV's TH/2016. Here, we showed a recombination breakpoint at base positions 380-820, located in the Rep gene, which overlaps the putative ORF3 region. The Rep gene encoded by ORF1, plays a critical role in viral replication [19] [20] [21] , whereas ORF2 encodes the immunogenic icosahedral capsid protein 22, 23 .",

            "text": "Studies of PCV2 genomes have shown that these viruses undergo homologous recombination events contributing to an increased genetic diversity and that those events are most commonly observed in the Rep gene [15] [16] [17] 24, 25 . However, intra-and inter-genotypic recombination events have also been documented to occur in the Cap gene of other circoviruses 26, 27 . Mixed infections are a predisposing factor for homologous recombination. The recombination patterns that are generated can be influenced likewise by different mechanistic factors. These include the ori site, secondary structure features, sequence similarity and replication/transcription discongruities among other factors 28, 29 . In the present study, the presence of a strain (CanineCV CP191/TH2016) most closely related to CanineCV JZ98/2014, indicates that the strain from which the nt region 380-820 of the recombinant viruses derives, circulates in Thailand. Therefore, we speculate that homologous recombination during a mixed infection has most likely generated the present recombinant strain. However, with the present data, it is not clear which mechanistic factor influenced the occurrence of the discussed recombination event. Moreover, a recent study on PCV2 revealed that the virus may have gradually evolved into several strains due to selective pressure such as vaccination by promoting a change of viral capsid protein away from the vaccine specific antigenic determinants 30, 31 . Furthermore, in addition to a recombination breakpoint in CanineCV's TH/2016, a point mutation (nt 333) in Rep gene (nt 333) was observed in CanineCV-CP191 TH/2016, a mutation observed previously in only two Italian CanineCVs AZ4133-1/13, KT734815 and AZ4133-2/13, KT734827). Although point mutations Analysis of genome sequences of the novel Thai CanineCV's identified in this study, showed the presence of ORF3, a recently recognized overlapping anti-directional region of ORF1 gene that is dispensable for virus replication 32 but has been linked to virus-induced apoptosis in PCV2 33 . Recent studies showed that ORF3-deficient PCV2 were less pathogenic in mice in comparison to analogous infections with wild type strains 34 . However, the relevance in natural infections remains questionable as virus attenuation was not observed upon infection of pigs with ORF-3-deficit PCV2 32 . Investigations into the function of the ORF-3 region in addition to phenotypic consequences of any mutations in this region of the Thai CanineCV's should therefore be undertaken. The recombination breakpoint of CanineCV strains in our study occurred in the Rep gene, which also encompasses the ORF3 region. It is not clear if this recombination event impacts on the pathogenesis of CanineCV infection, calling for further investigation.",

These alignments were used to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood method with TN93+G for complete genome, K2+G model for Rep gene and HKY+G for Cap gene as best-fit model of nucleotide substitution according to Bayesian Information Criterion 40 . All phylogenetic trees were tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Sequence pairwise distances of CanineCV genomes were calculated using Maximum Composite Likelihood model 43 . The evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA 7 44 . In order to identify the possibly recombinant origin(s) of CanineCV TH/2016 strains, a recombination detection program 4 (RDP4) package v. Beta 4.94, an integrated software program 45 was used. Briefly, the recombination events of CanineCV's TH/2016 were detected by using a range of recombination detection methods including RDP, GeneConv, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimera, SiScan and 3Seq with cut-off acceptable p-value at 0.01. Bonferroni correction was used as a general setting. The complete genomes of CanineCV's available in GenBank were included in the RDP analyses. Similarity plot and bootscan analysis in SIMPLOT software package version 3.5.1 46 were also performed on CanineCV sequences. Briefly, a bootscaning analysis was performed on four groups of complete CanineCV genome sequences based on differential clustering in the phylogenetic tree. The bootscan analysis was tested under the Kimura-2 parameter (K2P) model for 100 replications, with a window size of 200 bp, step size of 20 bp and a transition/transversion ratio of 2. The similarity plot was performed under the same group and conditions with GapStrip model. Identified recombinant sequences were also allegorized with their potential parents by genetic marker positions to obtain further evidence of genetic recombination.",

In addition to lung tissue, brain, liver, tracheobronchial lymph node, tonsil and kidneys were analyzed for the presence of CanineCV (Supplementary Table S2 ). Briefly, the extracted nucleic acids from each sample were used as template for cDNA synthesis as described above. The PCR reaction consisted of 5x OneTaq Buffer, 10 mM of dNTP, 1 U Hot start Taq polymerase (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.), 10 \u00b5M final concentration of each primer and 2 \u00b5l of cDNA. Cycler conditions consisted of initial denaturation for 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 de-parafinization of FFPE sections and hydration in graded ethanol, samples were washed in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Proteolytic digestion of samples was performed with 1 \u00b5g/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). An overnight incubation at 52 \u00b0C with 1000 ng/100 \u00b5l sense and antisense probe, respectively, was performed following post-fixation, acetylation and pre-hybridization. Detection was carried out using an anti-DIG antibody (diluted 1:200) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) in combination with nitrobluetetrazoliumchloride (NBT, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphatate (BCIP, X-Phosphate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) as substrates. Distinct, purple precipitates, that were clearly cellular located, were considered positive.",

CanineCV positive PCR products were visualized on 1% Agarose gel and then purified by Monarch DNA Gel extraction kit (New England Biolab, Frankfurt, Germany) prior to Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). To confirm the presence of CanineCV, in situ-hybridization (ISH) was performed on FFPE tissues, including lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, kidney, urinary bladder, heart, trachea and lungs. ISH was performed as previously described with minor variations47 . Probes were designed from alignment of published CanineCV genomes as follows: sense Probe: 5\u2032-ACTACTGAAAGATAAAGGCCTCTCG-3\u2032, antisense Probe: 5\u2032CGAGAGGCCTTTATCTTTCAGTAGT-3\u2032, and labelled with Digoxigenin (DIG) that covered 25 bp of the CanineCV (nt 905-929).
