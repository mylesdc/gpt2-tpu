The factors associated with severe diseases are not well defined, but more severe disease is more often seen among persons aged .65 years, infants, pregnant women, and individuals of any age with underlying health conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using gene expression microarrays, the transcriptomic profiles of influenza-infected patients with severe (N = 11), moderate (N = 40) and mild (N = 83) symptoms were compared with the febrile patients of unknown etiology (N = 73). We found that influenza-infected patients, regardless of their clinical outcomes, had a stronger induction of antiviral and cytokine responses and a stronger attenuation of NK and T cell responses in comparison with those with unknown etiology. More importantly, we found that both interferon and ubiquitination signaling were strongly attenuated in patients with the most severe outcomes in comparison with those with moderate and mild outcomes, suggesting the protective roles of these pathways in disease pathogenesis.",

In human and animal models of seasonal influenza, influenza virus A/H5N1 (Avian Influenza A H5N1 virus) and A/H1N1/1918 (Influenza A H1N1 1918 strain) the cytokine levels in host respiratory secretions and serum have been associated with disease severity and outcome [3] . Hypercytokinemia was observed in humans infected with influenza virus A/H5N1 and found to be correlated to severity and mortality [4] . The innate immune responses in humans infected with influenza virus A/H5N1 suggest that pro-inflammatory mediators are contributing to disease pathogenesis, with elevated blood levels of IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-c, and sIL-2R and elevated levels of IP-10, MCP-1, and MIG observed in patients [5] . Such responses may contribute to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure observed in many patients. Recently, IFITM3, an interferon-induced transmembrane protein, has been shown to have important roles in restricting the morbidity and mortality in mice infected with influenza virus [6] .",

RIG-I is the key host sensor for viral RNA inside the cytoplasm that accounts for the induction of the host IFN response [15] . Ubiquitination of the CARD domain in RIG-I is essential for the activation of IRF3 and NFkB which in turn induce the IFN production [16] [17] . As mentioned above, ubiquitination of RIG-I is the key process by which the host could recognize the influenza virus RNA to induce interferon response. The attenuation of the protein ubiquitination pathway and RIG-I could lead to the lack of interferon response in the severe patients. It was also shown that the host protein ubiquitination system is required for influenza virus replication [17] . This may explain why the percentage of patients who had virus detected at sample collection was lower in Signatures of Severe Influenza Revealed by Gene Expression Microarray the severe group (55%) in comparison with those in the moderate group (86%). As mentioned, although the same pathways were up-regulated in the patients with different severity outcomes, certain genes such  as TLR10, NFKBIA, IL1R2, SOCS3, IL4R, IL1R1, PROK1,  ECE1, IFNAR1, MMP9, PPP1R10 and PPP2R2A were upregulated only in the severe patients. It was shown in mouse model that MMP9, which is capable of digesting the extracellular matrix, was produced mainly by neutrophils and was required for neutrophils migration to the respiratory tract in response against viral replication [18] . The up-regulation of MMP9 in the severe patients suggests the contribution of this gene in the disease outcome. The up-regulation of the Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) gene was IFNAR1-dependent and it has negative regulatory functions to the innate immune response which could inhibit type I interferon signaling [19] . The lack of interferon signaling in the severe patients could be explained by the up-regulation of SOCS3 in these patients. TLR10 has recently been shown to play a role in innate immune response in influenza infection and that its expression is stronger during infection by the highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus [20] .",

More interestingly, these pathways in patients with severe disease were more predominant in comparison with patients with mild and moderate disease. Previous studies have shown that type I interferon response could be exploited by opportunistic pathogens in influenza infection which in turn could increase the host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae by negatively regulating the T cell response [21] . We did not detect any secondary bacterial infections in the moderate and severe patients by using both conventional blood culture or by 16S rRNA sequencing (data not shown). This could be due to the fact that all of the patients were treated with antibiotics before they were recruited to the study.",

Previous studies have shown that severe influenza A disease was associated with a transient NK cell and CD8 T cell response [22, 23] . Amongst the downregulated genes, NCR3 has been reported to show a direct interaction with influenza viruses whereby the virus downregulates the cytotoxicity of NK cells mediated by this gene [24, 25] . In addition, single polymorphisms in NCR3 have been shown to be strongly associated with decreased lung function in a recently conducted large scale (N.48,000) genome-wide association study of forced expiratory volume as a surrogate for lung function [26] .",

Nevertheless, we have generated a large exploratory transcriptomic dataset in influenza disease with a wide spectrum of severity. Although the validation of these findings is beyond the scale of the current study, our dataset can serve as a valuable data mine for researchers in the field to select their own gene candidates for hypothesis testing and validation. Taken together, by investigating the global host transcriptional profile in influenza virus A infected patients with different clinical outcomes, we have provided insights into the global gene expression in influenza virus A infection. In particular, we have revealed the attenuation of interferon and protein ubiquitination pathways and the down-regulation of T and NK cell related responses in patients with severe influenza virus A infections. Lastly, we propose the following candidate genes for further studies: MMP9, SOCS3, IFITMs, TLR10, RIG-I, CD244 and NCR3.",
