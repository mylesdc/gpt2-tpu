A 'functional protein microarray' contains a set of proteins individually produced and positioned in an addressable format on a microarray surface. Functional protein microarrays are useful for identifying binding activities or targets of modification enzymes. The first version of a proteome microarray was reported in 2001 and contained 5,800 yeast proteins with amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags printed on the array [4] . A second version of yeast protein microarrays was generated recently and contained 5,600 proteins with carboxy-terminal 6His-HA-ZZ domain tags [5] . Proteins from both collections were overexpressed, purified and spotted onto the protein microarrays. Global proteome studies were performed on these chips to understand various biological mechanisms. For example, 87 yeast kinases were examined for their substrates using yeast protein microarrays and over 4,200 in vitro substrates representing 1,325 unique proteins were identified [6] . Compared with the approximately 150 known in vivo kinase-substrate interactions, this global study served as an important first step for dissecting yeast signaling networks. In addition to searching for kinase substrates, proteome chips can be probed with labeled proteins, DNA, lipids, antibodies and many other molecules to search for interacting proteins [4, 7, 8] . Large amounts of data have been generated using protein microarrays, presenting significant challenges in developing robust methods to process the raw data and building reasonable biological hypotheses from the datasets.",

            "text": "Both DNA and protein microarrays are prone to systematic errors that are usually generated from different sources, such as surface defects and spatial artifacts. Many studies have offered insight on noise subtraction in DNA microarrays [11] [12] [13] [14] , but little investigation has been done for protein microarrays. Functional protein microarrays differ in many respects from DNA microarrays. First, the goals of these two microarrays are different. DNA microarrays measure the relative DNA levels in a pool of probes, whereas functional protein arrays often aim at discovering global interactions of a single probe molecule. Second, a typical DNA microarray experiment measures signal ratios between two color channels, one for a tested mRNA sample and the other for a reference sample [15] . Signals in the second channel may serve as intrinsic controls that can help to decrease the effects of various amounts of reagent on the arrays and any local array nonuniformity. Furthermore, many current scaling methods are then based on the assumption that signal intensities should be balanced between the two color channels despite variation in slide location, intensity and other sources of systematic variation [16] [17] [18] . However, such controls are missing in onecolor-channel protein microarrays. Third, several scaling approaches in DNA microarrays are based on a set of 'housekeeping' genes that give constant signal intensities at different conditions [19, 20] . However, in protein microarrays, such a control group must be customized according to the type of activities that are assayed, and, therefore, a ubiquitous reference group does not exist. Fourth, unlike DNA microarrays, in which non-specific binding can often be addressed by signal comparison with mismatch probes [21] , cross-reactivities of protein microarrays can not be as directly corrected for. A separate slide is, therefore, often required to be probed in parallel as a negative control in protein microarray experiments. Finally, several protein-specific artifacts serve as common noise sources in protein microarrays. In the kinase assay, for example, the signal from strongly phosphorylated spots can bleed into neighboring spots, leading to incorrect background measurement. These differences are particularly applicable to functional protein microarrays in comparison to antibody arrays, and, therefore, the normalization techniques used for DNA microarrays are usually not directly applicable to functional protein microarrays.",

Specific approaches were then designed to deal with each type of noise. A correction approach is applied to reduce measurement errors in the background signals. In addition, spatial variations can be reduced efficiently through a novel two-parameter signal normalization approach and calling positive spots locally. After generating a list of positives, negative control slides are analyzed in the same approach and spots are subtracted from the list if they appear in the control slide. Slide features with poor signal qualities are also removed. Finally, signal intensities of the positives are normalized according to their protein amounts.

Signal intensities are generally quantified by subtracting the foreground intensities with the local background intensities, which are measured as the background signals immediately surrounding the spot of interest (termed here the 'adjacent background'; Figure 2b ). However, in protein microarrays local background regions can be easily skewed by artifacts such as small speckles. In addition, strong positive signals from on-chip kinase assays tend to produce signal smears on both film and phosphoimagers that exceed the normal feature size (Figure 2a) . In both cases, the measurement for that spot will be inaccurate. First, the background intensity will be arbitrarily high, which will diminish the real signal intensity for that spot. Second, the intensities will be affected by the alignment of the grid and extent of the smear, and, therefore, the variance of the same protein at replicate experiments will be increased.",

However, the aligning process requires considerable time and effort. The size of the smear may even prevent refitting the grid without adversely affecting neighboring spots. Additionally, a larger spot size can diminish the signal of the spot because the signal density decreases with increasing spot size. The second method for background correction, which is applied in ProCAT, replaces the background intensity of the central spot with the background from its local neighborhood. A three by three surrounding window is assigned to each protein spot, and the median background of the nine spots will be used as the 'neighborhood background' value for the central spot (see Materials and methods for more details).

To further characterize the effects of neighborhood background correction, we performed a test kinase assay with 100 nM protein kinase A (PKA) spotted at 96 locations on one slide (Figure 2a) . Each of the 48 blocks on the slide contains two PKA pairs with random yeast proteins spotted elsewhere (approximately 12,000 spots). After incubating the slide with 33 P-\u03b3-ATP, all of the PKA spots autophosphorylated and showed strong signals, and in many cases the signal went beyond the grid circle boundaries (Figure 2b ). We then applied the neighborhood background correction to the PKA spots. As expected, the median for PKA signal intensities was enhanced by 53%. Furthermore, the PKA signals from different positions are more similar to each other; the variance within them is decreased by 41% (p value = 0.006; Fig 2d) . Therefore, the neighborhood method for accessing background provides more robust measurements than that of the adjacent background method.",

Uneven probing can occur by several means, such as uneven mixing of the probe, exposure to the probe solution, or uneven washing and drying of the slides. Twocolor-channel experiments of DNA microarrays provide intrinsic controls that can be used to account for spatial artifacts. Functional protein microarrays often use only one color channel and, therefore, are especially prone to spatial artifacts. Spatial artifacts will cause inaccurate measurements of signal intensities and can hinder the identification of significant interactions. Adding more controls can help remove spatial artifacts since the signal of each spot can then be normalized according to its local controls. Due to the variable shape and size of spatial artifacts, ideally a large number of controls would be needed. However, space constraints of the protein chip and an inability to anticipate all the uses of the arrays usually prevent the necessary number of controls to fully account for spatial artifacts on the array.",

We developed a new normalization method to deal with the spatial artifacts specific to functional protein microarrays. By assuming that signal distribution in large windows is consistent across the slide, the foreground signal of each spot can be normalized according to signal intensities in its surrounding neighborhood. This assumption is usually valid in protein microarray experiments in which proteins are randomly printed on the array ( Figure 3 ). Two parameters, the median and the median absolute deviation (MAD), are calculated to represent the signal distribution in the local window ( Figure 4 ). To perform the normalization, the median and MAD of all sliding windows are averaged. The average values are then used to correct the signal of the central spot to To test the performance of this two-parameter scaling approach for signal normalization within one slide, we designed a test microarray containing multiple positive controls printed at different positions on the slide. The test array was organized in the same format as the commercially available protein microarrays (Invitrogen). Each protein was printed in duplicate, and the array contained 24 blocks of 16 by 16 printed proteins (Figure 5a ). Two GST-fusion proteins, Sla2p and Myo4p, were purified separately and a 1:1, 1:5, and 1:25 dilution of each protein was prepared. Sla2p and Myo4p at each concentration were printed at eight random positions on the array. Other spots were occupied with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as negative controls. In order to visualize the two fusion proteins, anti-GST antibody was used to probe the slide, and one probing with typical spatial artifacts is shown in Figure 5 . The artifact-containing slide showed different signal levels between the edges and the middle portion of the array. This produced blocks that had a variable signal distribution that ranged from high to low from one edge of the slide to the opposite edge; the variability occurred across blocks and simple block normalization methods adopted in DNA microarray normalization approaches [17] would not be suitable for dealing with this problem.",

Second, no obvious spatial artifacts were left after the normalization with any of the window sizes tested ( Figure  5b ). Third, a small window size diminishes any signal inequality that exists between positive signals and background noise. Indeed, a small scaling window tends to introduce extreme changes to the original signals and, therefore, increases the discrepancy between the duplicate spots of the same protein. The variance of the signals for the same protein after normalization with different window size was calculated. In five out of the six cases (three dilutions of two proteins) the scaling window 9 can successfully reduce the signal variance in a range from 31% to 90% (Figure 5c ). Decrease of signal variation suggests that a large scaling window will help to reduce spatial artifacts. Although larger window sizes are possible, 9 was used as the default number for ProCAT because the analysis can be done in a reasonable time and minimal improvement has been achieved after window size 7 (Additional data file 1).",

Traditionally, a global cutoff can be calculated from all spots and applied to the whole slide. Due to variable spatial artifacts, cutoffs were assigned locally in ProCAT. For each spot on the array the signal distribution within a nine by nine window was calculated and a cutoff defined as a number of standard deviations away from the mean; the default for ProCAT is two standard deviations. This cutoff corresponds to 5% significance level if the signal distribution within this local window is normal. When many spots with strong signals are included in the window, the cutoff will be arbitrarily high and thus decrease the sensitivity of detecting positive spots by the program. To avoid this loss in sensitivity, ProCAT has a built in function to identify possible outliers, to remove those outlier spots that have extremely strong signals, and then to calculate a cutoff for identifying positive spots using the remaining spots.",

Here we present ProCAT as a systematic approach to process and analyze data specific to functional protein microarrays. Calibrated by explicit test experiments, ProCAT has proven to be able to handle many types of functional protein microarray studies with three unique features. ProCAT includes novel scaling methods that provide robust and reproducible measurement for quantitative signals. This is crucial for protein microarrays as chip signal intensities often indicate strength of interactions. In addition, by calling positive candidates locally, ProCAT demonstrated excellent performance in identifying positives in comparison to global thresholds. Finally, each step has been integrated into a modular design to fit various experimental designs and stringency requirements.",

            "text": "A major challenge in designing any automated data processing method is thinking of and anticipating all possible situations that may arise. ProCAT uses a local three by three window to correct background containing signal smears or dust speckles. This method assumes the artifacts are sparse enough so that the majority of the nine spots in the local window still provide correct measurements of the background signals. Since the median value of nine spots is used to correct the background, a few biased spots within the window will not severely affect the corrected background value. This assumption is usually valid since the percentage of spots that are either positive or whose signal is contaminated by artifacts in protein microarray experiments is generally quite low. In extreme cases where such spots are likely to be very close to each other, a larger window (five by five for example) can be used. Large artifacts such as bright speckles and incubation bubbles may affect many spots in a particular region. Since the shapes of these artifacts are variable, it is necessary to manually flag these spots initially and then remove them from future analysis. Many commercially available software packages for microarray experiments have a built in flagging function, and ProCAT will automatically discard flagged spots.",

            "text": "A key aspect of ProCAT is the two-parameter approach for reducing spatial nonuniformity. Several factors can affect the performance of ProCAT's normalization. First, ProCAT normalizes the signal of a spot according to the signal distribution in its local neighborhood. It diminishes the signal intensity if the spot is located in a high signal neighborhood, while compensating the intensity if it is in a low signal neighborhood. This approach is based on the assumption that signal intensities across the slide share the same distribution, and it holds true if and only if the regional variations observed on the slide are due to technical artifacts and not from real biological differences. Since proteins are printed in a random order on most of the current protein microarrays, it is unlikely a particular region of the slide will gain high intensities as a result of biologically relevant reasons. Second, the size of the neighborhood window can also largely affect the performance of the normalization. Small window sizes tend to add biases to signals and diminish all local variations, whereas large window sizes increase the computational burden and tend to preserve local variations. We found that the optimal window size of ProCAT is 9 for protein-protein interactions; this figure corresponds to approximately four blocks on the chip and is used as the default. Other window sizes can also be chosen to fit various shapes of spatial artifacts.",

Thus far, the twoparameter scaling approach has only been used in single chip normalization; however, a similar strategy can be extended to rescale multiple slides by assuming signals in neighborhood windows on different slides are similarly distributed. Overall, ProCAT provides a powerful and flexible new approach for optimal processing and analysis of functional protein microarrays.",

(b) The autophosphorylation experiment showed typical bleeding problems in positive control spots.
