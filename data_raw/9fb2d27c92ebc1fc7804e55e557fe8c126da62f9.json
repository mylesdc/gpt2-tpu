RSV RNA was measured in peripheral blood samples sequentially obtained in RSV infected mice, mice inoculated with heat-inactivated RSV and uninfected controls from day 1 to 21 postinoculation. Mice inoculated with HI-RSV and non-infected controls did not have RSV RNA detected in the blood at any time point evaluated. Fig. 2 . A The Y-axis represents the percentage of positive samples detected in each experimental condition and the X-axis the time points evaluated.

To define the distribution of RSV antigens in the lungs, IHC staining was performed using a polyclonal RSV antibody. Immunostaining showed an increasingly positive stain for RSV in the alveolar epithelium from day 1 to days 3-4 and decreased by days 6-7 post-inoculation. On the other hand, IHC in alveolar macrophages was negative on day 1, occasionally positive on day 3, strong and diffusely positive on days 4 to 6 and also decreased by day 7. Both the alveolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages were negative for RSV staining on days 10 and 14 postinfection (Fig 6A; 6A-H) . In contrast to airway obstruction, there was no significant correlation between the severity of lung inflammation (HPS) and blood RSV RNA loads on day 5, illustrating the different time course of these two parameters of disease severity (Fig. 6.B) .",

Three studies documented the presence of RSV RNA by real-time PCR in blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a subset of neonates and children with RSV lower respiratory tract infection [8] [9] [10] . In those studies, RSV RNA was also found in the blood of a small percentage of children with no evidence of RSV infection, and the association between the detection of RSV in the blood and parameters of disease severity was inconclusive. On the other hand, the detection of RSV RNA in the serum of a 2-month old with RSV bronchiolitis was associated with the development of hepatitis, indicating the possible dissemination of RSV in Figure 4 Dynamics of Cytokine Expression in blood during Acute RSV Infection. Blood CCL2, CXCL1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 mRNA expression was assessed from 4-6 mice per time-point per group in 3 independent experiments from days 1 to 7 after inoculation (Fig. 4A-D) . Mice were intranasally inoculated with live-RSV (solid grey bars), heat-inactivated RSV (hatched bars), or 10% EMEM (solid black bars). Values are represented as means \u00b1 SD. One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons with non-infected controls mice (*p < .001). When this test demonstrated a significant difference between groups the Tukey test to correct for multiple comparisons was used and considered significant for a p < 0.05. Fig 6A [1 -8] : From days 1 to 7 post-inoculation, changes included perivascular edema and margination of neutrophils (day 1), which progressed to a sparse perivascular infiltrate and later to dense perivascular and peribronchial/peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages and scattered neutrophils. At its peak (days 5 to 7), these inflammatory infiltrates extended into surrounding alveolar septa in a stellate manner with patchy involvement of the parenchyma and abundant macrophages, occasional lymphocytes and neutrophils in alveolar spaces. On days 10 and 14 the persistent changes included inflammatory infiltrates located around vessels and airways, consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages, but no neutrophils or eosinophils. Fig 6A. [A-H]. By immunohistochemical staining (IHC) the alveolar epithelium showed a diffuse faint linear staining on day 1, was stronger and widespread on days 3-4, and decreased by days 6-7. In contrast, alveolar macrophages' IHC was negative on day 1, occasionally positive on day 3, strong and diffusely stained on days 4 to 6 and decreased by day 7. Both the alveolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages were negative for RSV IHC on days 10 and 14 post-infection. Fig 6B. Histopathologic scores significantly increased in mice infected with live-RSV from day 1 (HPS mean \u00b1 SD; 5.7 \u00b1 0.5) to day 5 (HPS 11.2 \u00b1 2.1; p = 0.005), day 6 (HPS = 13.6 \u00b1 2.3; p = 0.001) and day 7 (HPS = 10.7 \u00b1 3.3; p = 0.02). There was no correlation between the peak of blood RSV RNA loads and lung inflammation.",

Similarly, on days 4 to 6 post-infection the distribution of RSV antigens in the lungs was predominant in alveolar macrophages.

We did not document viral replication in the blood using traditional cell culture, which may be due to the limited sensitivity of the culture assay with small sample volumes. Nevertheless, RSV RNA was consistently detected only in peripheral blood of mice inoculated with live RSV, suggesting that live viral infection is required for pathogenic viral dissemination. We further documented the presence of RSV by a completely different methodology, and identified a cell subtype, monocytes, bearing RSV antigens in peripheral blood. It is possible that the high RSV inoculum used caused severe lung inflammation and cell damage with subsequent leakage of RSV particles, which may have been engulfed by peripheral blood monocytes. However, the decrease of blood RSV RNA loads after treatment directed against RSV suggests that the detection of RSV RNA in peripheral blood truly reflected the spread of the virus to the systemic compartment. Lastly, the identification of RSV RNA was limited to the respiratory tract and peripheral blood but not to other organs, which could have help to indirectly assess the systemic spread of RSV during the acute infection, and warrants further studies to determine whether other organs are also affected in severe RSV disease.",
