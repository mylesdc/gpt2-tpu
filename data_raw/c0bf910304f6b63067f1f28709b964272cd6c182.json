In this study we build a thermodynamic model based on Bayesian statistics to explain how \u22121 programmed ribosome frameshifting can work. As training sets for the model, we measured frameshifting efficiencies on 64 dnaX mRNA sequence variants in vitro and also used 21 published in vivo efficiencies. With the obtained free-energy difference between mRNA-tRNA base pairs in the 0 and \u22121 frames, the frameshifting efficiency of a given sequence can be reproduced and predicted from the tRNA\u2212mRNA base pairing in the two frames. Our results further explain how modifications in the tRNA anticodon modulate frameshifting and show how the ribosome tunes the strength of the base-pair interactions.",

            "text": "R ibosome frameshifting is a recoding event that causes ribosome slippage along the mRNA and changes the sequence of the synthesized protein. Frameshifting can direct the ribosome into \u22121, +1, \u22122, or even +4 frame, but the most common type is \u22121 frameshifting [1] [2] [3] [4] . Spontaneous ribosome slippage is a rare event that occurs, on average, once in 10 4 -10 5 codons 5, 6 . This low spontaneous frameshifting increases dramatically on particular mRNAs that contain sequences for programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). PRF requires a slippery sequence, which usually comprises a X XXY YYZ heptamer, where XXX and YYY are triplets of identical bases and Z is any nucleotide, which allows for cognate pairing of the P-site and A-site tRNAs in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame [7] [8] [9] . The nature of the tRNAs bound to the slippery site codons is critical, including the modifications of nucleotides in the anticodon loop (i.e., at positions 34 and 37 of the tRNA) 8, 10, 11 . Frameshifting is facilitated by mRNA elements that slow down the ribosome progression along the mRNA, such as secondary structures (stem loops or pseudoknots) downstream of the slippery site. \u22121PRF is common in viruses and is found also in bacteria and eukaryotes [12] [13] [14] , where it is employed to increase the coding capacity of the genome, define stoichiometry of translation products or to regulate the lifetime of the mRNA.",

Ensemble kinetics and smFRET studies suggested that \u22121PRF occurs predominantly during the translocation step when the two tRNAs in the A and P sites move to the P and E sites, respectively [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Displacement of the tRNAs weakens the interactions with the mRNA and the ribosome 22 . The mRNA secondary structure element downstream of the slippery site impedes the reverse movement of the 30S ribosomal subunit head domain, which resets the ribosome interactions with the mRNA-tRNA complex in the P site 19 . While the ribosome makes multiple attempts to complete translocation, tRNAs can realign into the \u22121-frame 17, 18 . Alternatively, frameshifting can occur when the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site is delayed, e.g., due to the lack of a particular amino acid 20, 21, 23, 24 . In this case, a tRNA bound to the P site can slip from the 0-frame to the \u22121-frame independently of the mRNA secondary structure elements 20, 21 .",

The frameshifting efficiency (FS) on dnaX is 70-80% in vitro and in vivo 16, 20, 25, 26 . Both codons of the slippery sequence are read by tRNA Lys . E. coli has a single tRNA Lys isoacceptor (anticodon 3\u2032 UUS 5\u2032 ), for decoding the two Lys codons, AAG and AAA. The modified nucleotide mnm 5 s 2 U (S) at the first anticodon position (U34 in the tRNA sequence) is important for the wobble base pairing at the third codon position 27 . The modified nucleotide base pairs more stably with A than with G (ref. 28 ), which may favor tRNA Lys slippage on A 4 AAG 7 codons 8 . In E. coli, also nucleotide A37 adjacent to the anticodon of tRNA Lys is modified.

The model explains why A 1 G and A 4 G mutations of the A 1 AAA 4 AAG 7 motif support surprisingly efficient frameshifting, shows how synonymous codons affect FS, and suggests how tRNA modifications contribute to frameshifting. Furthermore, comparison of the base-pair free-energy differences on the ribosome and in solution allows us to quantify the effect of the ribosome environment on the stability of the codon-anticodon complexes. These results explain the results of previous mutational and biochemical studies 16, 18, 20, 26, 31 and suggest that the frameshifting efficiency is controlled mainly by the relative thermodynamic stability of the codon-anticodon interactions in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame.",

            "text": "Experimental estimation of FS. We first compiled an experimental dataset of FS values using the established in vitro approaches 19, 20 (see the \"Methods\" section). We used the dnaX mRNA fragment encoding the slippery sequence Lys 1 Lys 2 flanked by an upstream SD-like sequence and a downstream stem-loop structure. We generated all possible mutant variants that encoded for combinations of either Lys or Phe codons in the 0-frame ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1a , and Supplementary Table 1 ). 70S ribosomes programmed with dnaX mRNA and carrying the initiator f[ 3 H]Met-tRNA fMet in the P site were mixed with aminoacyl-tRNAs that are required to translate the mRNA up to the frameshifting site (one of which is [ 14 C]-labeled) and elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Translation products of the 0-frame and \u22121-frame were separated by reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and quantified by scintillation counting (Supplementary Fig. 1b) . FS was calculated as a ratio of the \u22121-frame product to the sum of 0-frame and \u22121-frame peptides (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs We first validated that mutations in the slippery sequence do not alter the mechanism of frameshifting using the codon-walk approach 20 . Previous results indicated that the rate of Lys 1 and Lys 2 incorporation on slippery codons AAA 4 and AAG 7 is independent of the slippage-inducing mRNA stem-loop, whereas incorporation of the subsequent Phe (F) is delayed 20-fold by the stem-loop 20 . This indicated that the ribosome is stalled after the incorporation of Lys 2 on the AAG 7 codon and that frameshifting takes place during the delayed translocation. The incorporation of Val in the \u22121 frame is very efficient compared to the 0-frame Phe and the FS calculated from the ratio of the rate constants of \u22121 frame to 0-frame Val and Phe incorporation, respectively, is consistent with the end-point measurements ( Supplementary  Fig. 1b) . To test whether the branch point of frameshifting is the same on other slippery site variants, in particular those where frameshifting involves non-Watson-Crick codon-anticodon interactions in the \u22121-frame, we determined the rates of frameshifting for three slippery sequence variants, A 1 G, A 1 U, and A 4 G. With these mRNAs, the presence of the downstream stem-loop did not affect the incorporation rate for Lys 2 , but reduced the rate of the 0-frame Phe incorporation. Another observation suggesting that frameshifting takes place at the translocation step is that with the wild-type dnaX sequence, the presence or absence of tRNAs decoding the Phe (0-frame) or Val (\u22121-frame) codons downstream the slippery sequence does not change the FS. This indicates that the commitment to the new reading frame occurs before the Val or Phe codon is available for decoding in the A site, that is at the preceding translocation step 20 . Similarly, for the A 1 G, A 1 U and A 4 G variants the incorporation efficiency is not affected by the presence of Val-tRNA and Phe-tRNA encoding the overlapping (G UUC) codons ( Supplementary Figs. 2b, c and 3b ). For the A 4 G construct, if tRNA slippage occurred on the first codon (AAG 4 ) while the second codon was free, the second codon would be decoded in the \u22121-frame (G 4 AA) by Glu-tRNA Glu , resulting in a MAKE peptide. However, in the presence of Glu-tRNA Glu , the MAKK peptide is still predominant ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ), indicating that slippage takes place after the decoding of the second codon by tRNA Lys . In the presence of all aa-tRNAs, we observe only about 5% of the frameshifting peptide containing Glu (MAKEV) ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ), rendering an alternative frameshift pathway, e.g., stimulated by aa-tRNA depletion, unlikely under given conditions. We then replaced the wild-type dnaX slippery Lys 1 Lys 2 codons with all possible sequences that encode synonymous Lys (AAA/ G) or Phe (UUU/C) codons: tRNA Lys and tRNA Lys , tRNA Phe and tRNA Phe , tRNA Lys and tRNA Phe , or tRNA Phe and tRNA Lys (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1 ). For all codons in the 0-frame of these sequences, base pairs in the first and second positions of the codon-anticodon complex are only Watson-Crick base pairs, whereas in the third position Watson-Crick and wobble basepairs are tolerated 27, 32 . The FS of the wild-type slippery sequence is about 80%, consistent with the previous reports in vivo and in vitro 16, 20, 25, 26 . Several slippery-sequence variants also support efficient frameshifting, whereas others diminish frameshifting considerably. Notably, for sequences that have exactly the same codons in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame (A 1 AAA 4 AAA 7 and U 1 UUU 4 UUU 7 ) the FS is very close to 50% (Fig. 1b) , suggesting that the 0-frame and \u22121-frames are equally possible at these conditions, i.e., the ribosome is not inherently committed to maintaining the 0-frame. The FS was high not only with the sequences where \u22121PRF resulted in canonical Watson-Crick base pairs in the \u22121 reading frame, but also in several cases with the expected first position mismatch on one of the slippery codons, such as for C/U/G 1 AAA 4 AAA 7 , A 1 AAG 4 AAA/G 7 , A/C/ G 1 UUU 4 UUU 7 , A 1 AAG 4 UUU 7 or U 1 UUU 4 AAG 7 (the \u22121frame codon is underlined). Even with two first position mismatches, such as with G/C 1 AAG 4 AAG 7 the FS is 8-9%, well over the minimum FS value of about 2% found for this tRNA pair on the C 1 AAG 4 AAA 7 sequence. Free-energy model of \u22121PRF. Upon frameshifting, the mRNA-tRNA base pairs change depending on the slippery sequence (Fig. 1a) . We asked whether the FSs can be explained by differences in the interaction free-energy between the base pairs involved in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame duplex. If all individual base-pair free-energy differences \u0394G bp were known, and assuming thermodynamic equilibration during the frameshifting, the FS a b",

The remaining six base-pair changes only occur in pairs in the sequences used here (Fig. 2c ). For these changes, we obtained the free-energy differences of changing two base pairs at the same time. Positive free-energy differences indicate that the free energy of base pairing in the \u22121-frame is larger than in the 0-frame, i.e., that base pairing in the \u22121-frame is less favorable than in the 0-frame. Accordingly, the larger free energy of the \u22121 frame renders frameshifting less likely, and thus FS < 50% is expected. Next, we calculated distributions of FS values (FS model ) from the obtained distributions of the free-energy differences using the ratio of Boltzmann distributions shown above (see the \"Methods\" section). Despite the fact that our model only contains 14 free parameters, the calculated efficiencies agree well with the measured efficiencies with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.5% between the mean FS model and the FS experiment (Fig. 2d ).",

Each panel shows FS values for a tRNA pair (rmsd 2.5%). e For cross-validation of the model, iteratively, each FS value was predicted using free-energy differences obtained from all other FS values (rmsd 4.1%). For each mRNA sequence, one square is centered at the mean value and the width and height correspond to two times the standard deviation partitioning between frameshifting and translocation would be negligible and the probability of the ribosome to switch into \u22121frame would be predominantly thermodynamically controlled. This assumption is plausible, because translocation is slowed down considerably by the mRNA stem-loop, but as the elemental rate of tRNA slippage is not known, the extent to which frameshifting is affected by kinetics is unclear. To challenge this assumption, we included a kinetic factor \u03ba into our model such that FS kinetic = FS \u00b7 (1\u2212\u03ba), where FS is obtained from the ratio of Boltzmann distributions (see the \"Methods\" section; Fig. 3a ). For the kinetic factor, we assumed that a free-energy barrier limits the rate of tRNA slippage from the 0-frame to the \u22121-frame and back, i.e. the slippage is slower than translocation. The mean kinetic factor for all mRNA variants was included within our Bayesian approach as a nuisance parameter. Similar as above, the probability of base-pair free-energy differences was obtained for all 64 sequences, now additionally including \u03ba. The resulting rmsd value (2.5%) is similar to that from the model without the kinetic contribution. Further, the most probable mean kinetic factor \u03ba was found to be below 0.1% (Fig. 3b) , which indicates that the kinetics of frameshifting does not markedly affect the FS in this experimental system. Independent estimations of frameshiting kinetics suggest that the rate of slippage into \u22121-frame is 10 s \u22121 on the original dnaX slippery sequence and 3 s \u22121 on the A 4 G sequence (B.-Z. Peng, L. V. Bock, R. Bellardinelli, F. Peske, H. Grubm\u00fcller, and M. V. Rodnina, unpublished data). In comparison, the step that limits the completion of translocation was estimated to 0.1-0.5 s \u22121 (refs. 19, 20 ) . This supports the notion that, with the frameshifting secondary structure element on the mRNA, completion of translation is sufficiently slow to allow the tRNAs to re-pair with their thermodynamically favored codons.",

Free-energy model applied to an independent dataset. Tsuchihashi et al. reported a large set of FS values for 23 variants of the dnaX mRNA in vivo 26 , which enabled us to test the freeenergy model of frameshifting against an independent dataset. The alternative dataset by Sharma et al. 36 could not be used, as the values for FS on the native dnaX slippery sequence are inconsistent with those of refs. 20, 26 , thereby precluding meaningful comparisons. We used 21 FS values from the Tsuchihashi dataset (Supplementary Table 3 ) to obtain probabilities for freeenergy differences, excluding the G 7 A variant, which was considered unreliable by the authors due to the possibility of transcriptional slippage 26 , and the 123C variant which encodes a proline and may reflect proline-specific stalling effects 37 . The 21 mRNA variants not only include seven variants that have been tested in this work, but also sequences that do not preserve the Lys or Phe codon identity, because their P-site and A-site codons encode different amino acids in the 0-frame. As a consequence, a larger set of 26 individual base-pair changes upon \u22121-frameshifting can be considered in the model. Notably, we did not include any information about the experimental FS values obtained in this work (Fig. 1b) , so using the Tsuchihashi dataset provides an independent test for the model in vivo. The green histograms in Fig. 2a -c show the probability distributions for the free-energy differences obtained from both datasets, and Fig. 4a -c show the distributions for the remaining base-pair changes. We obtained free-energy differences for six base-pairs in the P site (Figs. 2a and 4a) and for three in the A site (Figs. 2b and 4b), as well as for nine combinations of P-site and A-site base pairs (Figs. 2c and 4c).",

As expected, all free-energy differences \u0394G bp for changing a Watson-Crick base pair (A\u00b7U or U\u00b7A) into a mismatched base pair (C\u00b7U, U\u00b7U, G\u00b7U, A\u00b7A, C\u00b7A, G\u00b7A) are positive (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 4 ). Following this notion, more mismatches introduced in the \u22121 frame imply lower FS. Interestingly, changing the Watson-Crick A\u00b7U base pair to pyrimidine\u00b7pyrimidine (C\u00b7U or U\u00b7U) base pairs comes with the highest energetic penalty, whereas changing the Watson-Crick base pair to a mismatched pur-ine\u00b7pyrimidine base pair (A\u00b7U \u2192 G\u00b7U) or to a mismatched pyr-imidine\u00b7purine (U\u00b7A \u2192 C\u00b7A) has a lower penalty. The lowest penalty comes with the change to purine\u00b7purine base pairs (A\u00b7A or G\u00b7A). It is possible that in the codon-anticodon helix two pyrimidines are too far apart, while a pair of larger bases can form contacts, albeit not as well as the Watson-Crick base pairs. For the sequences investigated here, the only base-pair change with a negative \u0394G bp is G\u00b7S to A\u00b7S in the wobble position of the A-site codon (A3). The nucleotide S is a modified U (mnm 5 s 2 U) which interacts more strongly with A than with G; \u0394G bp = \u22122.9 or \u22124.6 kJ/mol from our in vitro dataset and the Tsuchihashi et al. dataset, respectively (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4 ).

The similar free-energy differences of mnm 5 s 2 U and mnm 5 U suggest that the s 2 modification of U does not play a large role in the base-pair free energy. This is different with yeast tRNA Lys , where mcm 5 -modified tRNA Lys lacking the s 2 group has a lower affinity of binding to the cognate codon AAA than the fully modified tRNA Lys38 . The difference may be related to the existence of two tRNA isoacceptors in yeast dedicated to reading of AAA or AAG codon each, whereas in E. coli one tRNA isoacceptor reads both codons. tRNA Phe with the 3\u2032 AAG 5\u2032 anticodon is able to decode codons UUC and UUU through C\u00b7G Watson-Crick or U\u00b7G wobble base pairing at the A3 codon position.

To further investigate the effect of the ribosome on the mRNA-tRNA base pairs, we compared the free-energy differences of the base pairs obtained from our model, \u0394G bp , with those calculated from free-energy molecular dynamics simulations for isolated base pairs in solution, \u0394G sol 40 (Fig. 6a, b) . The conformations of several Watson-Crick and mismatched mRNA-tRNA base pairs have been obtained by X-ray crystallography 27, 34 , which allows us to check whether the predicted free-energy differences are reflected in the conformational differences. The G\u00b7S \u2192 A\u00b7S change is favorable both in solution and in the A1 codon position on the ribosome, but it is slightly more favorable in solution (Fig. 6a) . The G\u00b7S and A\u00b7S base pairs both have two H-bonds on the ribosome 27 and in solution 40 , but the base-pair conformations differ (Fig. 6c, left panel) , which agrees well with the different free-energy differences. Interestingly, the sulfur atom (yellow) of the modified nucleotide mnm 5 s 2 U (S) is not directly involved in the base pairing on the ribosome, which also agrees with the observation that mnm 5 U, which lacks the sulfur atom, shows similar free-energy differences as mnm 5 s 2 U (see above). Base-pair changes introducing mismatches C\u00b7G \u2192 U\u00b7G and A\u00b7U \u2192 C\u00b7U are unfavorable both in solution and on the ribosome (Fig. 6a) . For the C\u00b7G \u2192 U\u00b7G change, the A-site conformations of the base pairs 34 are similar to those in solution (Fig. 6c, middle  panel) and indicate a loss of one H-bond, which again agrees with the positive free-energy differences \u0394G bp and \u0394G sol . In contrast, the A\u00b7U \u2192 U\u00b7U base-pair change is favorable in solution, but unfavorable on the ribosome (Fig. 6a) . This result agrees with the structural data which shows that for the U\u00b7U base pair a Watson-Crick-like conformation is enforced in the A site, which prevents H-bond formation 27 , while in solution two H-bonds can form, stabilizing the base pair (Fig. 6c, right panel) .",

We show that, when translocation is slowed down by an mRNA secondary structure element downstream of the slippery site, the propensity of a tRNA to frameshift on a given slippery codon is largely determined by the free energies of base pairing, and the FS can be confidently predicted based solely on the combinations of base pairs at a given frameshift site. For the presented system, kinetic effects do not contribute to frameshifting, indicating that the stalling time is sufficiently long to allow equilibration via frequent re-crossings of the free-energy barriers between the two reading frames. As a result, only the free-energy difference between the frames governs the FS. The \u0394G bp (kJ/mol) P site Fig. 6 Base pairs in solution and on the ribosome. a In the A site. Free energy of base pairs in solution, \u0394G sol , was estimated from MD simulations 40 . For \u0394G bp values, the mean (circle) and standard deviation (bar) of the probability densities is shown (from Fig. 2a) . Gray lines (at \u0394G = 0) indicate whether a given base pair change is favorable or unfavorable.

Lower row, the minimum free-energy conformation for the same base pairs in solution (adapted from Vendeix et al. 40 ) long pause of the ribosome at an mRNA secondary structure element may serve to achieve sufficient equilibration and thereby contribute to enhance the FS. For shorter stalling times, the pause would become too short for the barrier to be overcome sufficiently often, and thus one would predict the FS to decrease with increasing translocation rate. In this non-equilibrium case, the free-energy model that includes the kinetic contribution should provide good estimates for the rates of recoding. It would be interesting to see whether these rates differ for different tRNA species or for modified vs. non-modified tRNAs, which would indicate that certain tRNAs in the cell are more prone to frameshifting.",

            "text": "Our model also shows that for the studied mRNA variants under the given conditions, the free-energy differences of the individual base-pair changes are additive and appear not to be energetically coupled. The observation that the decoding center is in the same conformation with bound cognate or near-cognate tRNAs suggests that the free-energy difference between the two cases stems from the base-pair interactions 27, 34, 41, 42 , providing a possible reason for the absence of coupling. In all of the studied mRNA variants, the base pairs in second codon positions remain unchanged upon frameshifting (Fig. 1a) . However, if base pairs at the first and second codon positions would be changed at the same time, the helix conformation might change markedly, rendering a coupling between base-pair changes more likely. This effect can be tested by applying the free-energy model to a larger set of FS values for mRNA variants including sequences that lead to position 1 and 2 mismatches. Furthermore, the Watson-Cricklike conformations of U\u00b7G mismatches 34, 41, 42 imply that the freeenergy difference of changing a C\u00b7G to U\u00b7G in the first two codon positions is different from that in the third positions, where wobble base pairs are tolerated 34 . It was suggested that either tautomerization or ionization of the bases allow the U\u00b7G base pairs to adopt the Watson-Crick-like conformation 41 . Our freeenergy model applied to frameshifting efficiencies of mRNA variants which entail the C\u00b7G to U\u00b7G base-pair changes in different codon positions would provide access to the corresponding free-energy differences.",

If the pausing time is long enough, frameshifting efficiency FS, i.e., the probability of ending up in the \u22121-frame, is only determined by the free-energy difference between the 0-frame and \u22121-frame.

Metropolis sampling of P (\u0394G bp |FS experiment ) was carried out as described above (without kinetic factor), now for the 26 free-energy differences and 21 FS values. In the first step (Supplementary Fig. 8a) , the \u0394G bp of 9 base-pair changes have a low standard deviation \u03c3, showing that their free-energy differences are determined by the Tsuchihashi FS data set (green histograms in Figs. 2a, b, and 3a, b) . In steps 2-9 ( Supplementary Fig. 8b-i) , iteratively, the \u0394G bp of a base-pair change that had a large \u03c3 in all previous steps was set to 0 kJ/mol. Monitoring for which base-pair changes, the \u03c3 values were reduced, we could identify which \u0394G bp values of pairs of base-pair changes were determined (Figs. 2c and 3c) . Finally, in step 10, all the \u0394G bp values set to 0 kJ/mol in steps 2-9 were set to 0 kJ/mol at the same time ( Supplementary Fig. 8j ). For all steps 1-10, the rmsd for the measured FS values and those obtained from the model was found to be between 2.51% and 2.59%.
