            "text": "Background: As designated points of entry (PoEs) play a critical role in preventing the transmission of international public health risks, huge efforts have been invested in Taiwan to improve the core capacities specified in the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005). This article reviews how Taiwan strengthened the core capacities at the Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) and the Port of Kaohsiung (PoK) by applying a new, practicable model. Design: An IHR PoE program was initiated for implementing the IHR core capacities at designated PoEs. The main methods of this program were 1) identifying the designated PoEs according to the pre-determined criteria, 2) identifying the competent authority for each health measure, 3) building a close collaborative relationship between stakeholders from the central and PoE level, 4) designing three stages of systematic assessment using the assessment tool published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 5) undertaking action plans targeting the gaps identified by the assessments. Results: Results of the self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment revealed a continuous progressive trend at the TIA (86, 91, and 100%, respectively), and at the PoK (77, 97, and 99.9%, respectively). The results of the follow-up external assessment indicated that both these designated PoEs already conformed to the IHR requirements. These achievements were highly associated with strong collaboration, continuous empowerment, efficient resource integration, and sustained commitments. Conclusions: Considering that many countries had requested for an extension on the deadline to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements, Taiwan's experiences can be a source of learning for countries striving to fully implement these requirements. Further, in order to broaden the scope of public health protection into promoting global security, Taiwan will keep its commitments on multisectoral cooperation, human resource capacity building, and maintaining routine and emergency capacities.",

The point of entry (PoE) plays a critical role for early detection of disease risks and the mitigation of the impact of the rapid spread of infections. Therefore, border health measures have been applied at all international airports and seaports by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC). However, the emergence of new import infections urged Taiwan to ensure the capability of responding to the pandemic at PoEs. As it has always been a challenge to ensure prompt mobilization of various stakeholders at PoEs for jointly battling a threat of an epidemic, TCDC invested substantial efforts to seek a systematic and focused approach that can develop PoE capacities with the strong collaboration of stakeholders.",

The new regulations require state parties to enhance and monitor eight national core capacities. In addition, it also extends its scope by including the responsibility to respond to zoonotic, food safety, chemical, and radiological hazards (5) . The intent is to assist countries in focusing their efforts on the improvement of the detection, control, and response to international public health emergencies at their sources. Taiwan spared no efforts in conforming to the IHR 2005 provisions and announced the willingness to implement them 1 year ahead of schedule. Thus, before the IHR 2005 was officially enforced on June 15, 2007 , Taiwan had coordinated relevant government authorities to adopt the IHR provisions into domestic legislations, specifically in acts such as the 'Communicable Disease Control Act' and 'Regulations Governing Quarantine at Ports'. The amended legislations, which were regarded as the foundation of fulfilling IHR requirements, combined the goals and measures to be implemented in Taiwan, with the emphasis on the improvement of capacities in detecting, assessing, notifying, and responding to public health threats.",

In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an Assessment Tool for Core Capacity Requirements at Designated Airports, Ports and Ground Crossings (7) . In this tool, the capacity requirements have been transformed into 95 assessing indicators, which enable state parties to identify existing capacities or potential gaps, along with the formulation of plans of action that address the capacities that need to be improved, by assessing the stage of implementation. The 95 assessing indicators can be separated into three parts: 1) Part A: communication and coordination framework among various stakeholders, 2) Part BI: capacities necessary at all times (called Routine capacities), and 3) Part BII: responding to public health events of international concern (PHEIC, also called Emergencies).",

On the other hand, from their experience with previous pandemics, the global societies realized that a consistent policy based on common protocols and the cooperation between authorities at regional, national, and international levels are very critical for effective management of public health risks (12, 13) . Similarly, as the IHR requirements for core capacities of the PoEs mainly address the public health events, many additional aspects such as financial support, human resources, PoE facilities, PoE routine activities, and so on need to be considered while making policies and developing related protocol. It also highlights the importance of close communication and collaboration between international organizations, the central and local governments, and various competent authorities at PoEs (14) . It was found that meeting IHR 2005 obligations at a PoE is a universal challenge involving human resources, multisectoral engagement, and communication (15) . Further, some countries developed a crossdepartmental network/ platform, at either the central or PoE level, in order to facilitate the development of these core capacities (16, 17) .",

Originally, it was perceived that the TCDC shall serve this role. However, when the core capacity requirements were examined in detail, it was realized that some of the health measures mentioned in IHR 2005 were being conducted by other government authorities in reality. For example, if an ill traveler with symptoms of a possible communicable disease was reported in the PoK, the TCDC will be responsible for the assessment of the traveler. If the TCDC decided to refer the traveler to a hospital for further diagnosis and treatment, the PoK fire brigade would be responsible for transporting the traveler to the hospital (with their trained personnel and equipment). Thus, in order to cater to the practical situation in Taiwan, it was consensually decided that the competent authority shall vary according to the different health measures.",

The group comprised authorities from departments responsible for customs, immigration, quarantine, security and port management, and conveyance operators, as well as the local health authorities. It has successfully served as a coordinating platform at PoE level, targeted to the preparedness and the effective contingency arrangement of port health matters.

Therefore, it is believed that while developing the PoE core capacities, it would be more efficient if any important consensus and resource integration can be achieved in advance, at the central level, especially in terms of jurisdiction clarification and financial support. Furthermore, problems that universally exist among various PoEs are often related to issues in general structure, which can never be resolved by the individual PoEs alone. In this case, problem solving must highly rely on the mobilization of resources/support from the central government to the PoEs. For example, initially, both TIA and PoK felt that they lacked the expertise/capability to cope with radiological events, or plan their response to them because the central Atomic Energy Council commissioned no affiliated units at the PoEs. Consequently, the council dispatched experts directly to the TIA and PoK, to assist them in formulating radiological emergency planning, and provided necessary training for the early detection, operation of equipment, and approach to seek external support from the national radiological response team. An inter-ministerial central government task force (also called Central Government Taskforce) has subsequently been constituted. Under the successive leadership of Ministers without Portfolio, 1 13 ministries and agencies discussed important issues such as whether to grant PoEs financial support to purchase protective equipment, when to dispatch radiological/toxic chemical experts to PoE to provide technical consultation. The taskforce supervised and regularly reviewed the progress of the designated PoEs. It can also deliver assignments and provide the PoE Taskforce policy-related and technical guidance (Fig. 1) .",

Based on the information collected, the taskforce jointly decided the perceived stage of implementation (fully implemented, partially implemented, not implemented).",

Firstly, both the PoE Taskforces respectively prioritized the identified gaps, while taking into account factors such as urgency, resource availability, and achievability. Subsequently, action plans that described practicable approaches and resource investments, and which set a defined timeline with checking points, were developed. As improvement is always a dynamic process, regular monitoring and feedback is crucial to ensure progress and that outcomes are in line with expectations. The PoE Taskforces were allowed to adjust the scope and timeline of the plans according to current need and performance (Fig. 2) .",

In addition, two areas of consideration were proposed in the further implementation of the core capacities. First, as the detection of fever-screening limits for respiratory diseases was an area of concern, broader surveillance parameters may be considered to enable the detection of nonrespiratory diseases. Second, it was suggested that a risk assessment may be implemented to determine whether vector control measures are warranted, and whether a response protocol should be established to mitigate the risk of introduction of vectors detected in an aircraft. In response to the reviewers' recommendations, the TCDC, as the competent authority for these matters, are carrying out policy analysis of current entry screening procedures, as well as the vector surveillance/control on aircrafts (Table 1) .",

On the other hand, since the inspection of conveyances are sometimes closely linked with the management and the inspection of the port facilities (i.e. potable water, ballast water, and waste are transported between ships and seaport), it was appreciated that the PoK improved cross-sectional capacities by holding joint training programs for both ship and facility inspectors. In terms of emergencies, the reviewer perceived that the response system in the PoK has been improved since the self-assessment.

IHR 2005 presents a unique challenge to the surveillance and response community in both developed and developing countries' (15) . Since the beginning of the implementation of the IHR PoE program, there was a discussion on whether radiological and chemical capacities were needed to be involved in the assessments, as the WHO ambiguously described in one of the assessment indicators (Part BI d.2.3) that 'Harmful contamination, other than microbial contamination, such as from radionuclear sources, could also be found on ships, but is outside the scope of this guidance'. Further, due to the lack of international guidance, it seemed easier and less complicated to restrict the assessments to communicable diseases. However, it was subsequently determined that Taiwan should not ignore radiological and chemical hazards because the type of accidents that may occur at the PoEs cannot be predicted or selected. Sometimes, an accidental or deliberate release of chemical, biological, and radiological agents on arriving conveyances would have the potential to cause adverse health and financial consequences (18) . In this case, imported risks cannot be identified, nor be properly dealt with, without the relevant surveillance and response capacities. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 highlighted the need to involve diversified public health risks in Taiwan. Since then, more than 200 containers imported from Japan have been detected as being contaminated in the PoK. In this case, once possible potential nuclear hazard was detected, the custom authority, authorized to undertake radiological inspections, will implement a series of SOPs including risk identification/evaluation, reporting, PPEs for staff, etc.",

The drafts were submitted to stakeholders at the PoE and national disaster response authorities for peer-review before finalization. Meanwhile, required equipment was provided for the initial detection and personal protection (amount and type of equipment were suggested by experts from central authorities). In addition, as the success of any response is highly linked to the people who perform their roles, the required competencies and skills needed for specific response personnel were identified, and relevant training programs were designed. Regular drill exercises were conducted to verify the adequacy and interoperability of the plans, as well as to increase the stakeholders' familiarity with their responsibilities and operational procedures. Through the abovementioned efforts, the reviewers of the follow-up assessment noted a significant progress in establishing emergency response SOPs, as well as ensuring that resources were available to ensure rapid responses. From these experiences, it was learned that despite a lack of international principles and guidance for establishing core capacities, countries should try to take its own decisions on what to do and how to do it, based on its current infrastructure, and resources and demands. In addition, where possible, countries should build on existing systems and infrastructure for strengthening their capacities, rather than immediately investing in large-scale systems or infrastructure changes.",

Due to a lack of understanding of the IHR 2005, key stakeholders at central ministries and PoEs perceived that the regulations were only under the jurisdiction of the health ministries. Therefore, the TCDC invested considerable effort in advocating the aim and concepts of the IHR 2005. Despite these efforts, the IHR PoE program was not implemented very smoothly, due to the resistance and complaints from the field, until the Japan Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in 2011. Fearing the impact of nuclear contaminations (as traffic and trade are very frequent between Japan and Taiwan), people working at the PoEs were keenly aware of the importance of protecting themselves by enhancing the surveillance and response system. They found a selfmotivated actor (21) to participate in developing the PoE's core capacities, and gradually realized that they were jointly contributing to something beneficial for their own workplace, safety, and health. This change of attitude was helpful for further activities. Subsequently, to protect themselves, these stakeholders were willing to think about and invest more efforts in developing capacities to address the emergency response. For instance, people were very concerned if they were to be notified about anything unusual. Therefore, they carefully reviewed and updated the contact details of every stakeholder to ensure that event information can be disseminated immediately. It was also observed that the process of preparing for each assessment brought the stakeholders closer. As they shared the same objective of obtaining better results for the next assessment, partners involved in the PoE met frequently to discuss matters. This extensive participation of various professionals led to a robust unity and mutual understanding. The reviewers observed that all the relevant units at each PoE were united with a well-organized structure, and the contribution of the staff toward the implementation of the IHR was a major strength in the implementation of core capacities at PoEs in Taiwan. It is believed that this solidarity shaped through the IHR PoE program will continue even after the core capacity requirements have been fulfilled. It shall be continuously beneficial, not only for the daily operation of the PoEs, but also in co-confronting future crises.",

With incessant efforts invested in the 'learning by doing' process, the designated PoEs of TIA and PoK were assessed as highly consistent with the capacity requirements of the IHR 2005. As many countries had requested extensions to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements (22) , it is expected that experiences generated from Taiwan can provide some clues on how to identify and strengthen core capacities at designated PoEs.",

For this purpose, the Taiwanese government will remain committed toward implementing and reviewing the content of the IHR PoE program. So far, the coordination and collaboration at PoEs functioned well in response to the H7N9 outbreak that began in China at the end of March 2013. The emergency of a new disease reminded Taiwan that the collaborative mechanism and the partnership, which were already successfully triggered or shaped, should be continuously maintained to ensure the sustainability of the core capacities.",
