From 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV which is now going to cause another outbreak. Prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. In this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus. Results: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) approach was employed among spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. Next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. We found that conserved region is present only in the RNA directed RNA polymerase protein. In this protein we identified one epitope WDYPKCDRA is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains. Conclusions: Here we suggest in vivo study of our identified novel peptide antigen in RNA directed RNA polymerase protein for universal vaccinewhich may be the way to prevent all human coronavirus disease.",

Though the first two strains were not so much deadly but the other members were pathogenic. After SARS outbreak, a new coronavirus strain called MERS-CoV is now going to cause another outbreak [4] . The cell tropism and cellular receptor of the six types of coronaviruses are not similar (Additional file 7: Table S1 ). Though at first it was thought that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are structurally similar and tried to treat MERS-CoV infected patient with the SASR-CoV treatment. But it was found that they bind to two different receptors, namely ACE2 and DPP4 or CD26 respectively [36] . These viruses are actually zoonotic origin, undergo recombination, and may be in future another strain of this group of virus will come [37] . Therefore, it is important to take preventing measures not only to prevent this new strain of coronavirus, also against all the strain of coronavirus. There is no recommended vaccine for coronaviruses which is necessary to prevent. Most of the cases, vaccines were designed by targeting spike protein. Similarly, researchers also reported to design vaccine against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike protein [38, 39] . Fernando et al. also designed lived-attenuated MERS coronavirus by mutating MERS-CoV envelope protein as a vaccine which will be for only MERS-CoV [40] . These vaccines would thus be effective for only those strains not for others. Giving a universal vaccine for all strain of viruses is much more promising solution rather than giving individual vaccine for individual strain. The concept of prevention of viruses by designing a universal vaccine has also been reported previously, for example against Influenza virus. In case of influenza virus, universal vaccine against matrix 2 protein which was found to be conserved among all Influenza subtypes was reported [41] . An attempt to design universal vaccine against members of coronaviruses, like feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) targeting their spike protein in 1993 were observed [42] . But this concept was not applied to human coronaviruses.",

Traditionally vaccines were based on the intact pathogen, either inactivated or live attenuated. These types of vaccines had some crucial drawbacks like safety consideration and the loss of efficacy due to the genetic variation of the pathogen. But now a day's these vaccine concepts are greatly replaced by novel vaccine approaches like naked DNA vaccine, epitope based vaccine. The main benefit of immunization with an epitope-based vaccine is the ability to immunize with a minimal structure and it will stimulate an effective specific immune response, while avoiding potential undesirable effects [43] .",

For this purpose we did multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab of all six human coronaviruses. Replicase polyprotein 1ab was taken to check whether there is any conservancy among the non structural protein as this replicase polyprotein cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins. In case of S, E, M and N protein, no putative conserved region was found. But conserved region was found in case of replicae polyprotein 1ab where the conserved region was in the RNA directed RNA polymerase. This indicates that this protein is less mutating than the S, E, M and N protein. This RNA directed RNA polymerase protein was targeted to determine antigenic sites based on immunogenicity and surface accessibility using different bioinformatics analyses. The consensus antigenic sites were the desired one and their conservancy was also determined. From the conservancy analysis it was found that Bepipred [29] and IEDB [28] analysis predicted consensus epitope YPKCDRA and the surface accessibility analysis [30] predicted epitope WDYPKC are 100% conserved. This 100% conserved WDYPKC and YPKCDRA are actually located in the same region of RNA directed RNA polymerase and it was then taken as the targeted epitope. This epitope was found to be accessible and hydrophilic which is one of the crucial requirements for an epitope to be used as a vaccine. This reflects a promising scope to use this conserved epitope as a universal vaccine both as preventive and therapeutic treatment. As this epitope remain long been conserved since 1960, it may be possible to use this vaccine in future for upcoming human coronavirus strains as well. To become an effective vaccine, it needs to be highly immunogenic, stable inside the body. If it is poorly immunogenic or unstable, it needs to Figure 5 Conservancy of the predicted consensus epitopes. Three of the four epitopes were found to be 100% conserved. Here Y axis indicates the epitopes and X axis indicates the conservancy percentage. Figure 6 Hydrophilicity of the WDYPKCDRA epitope.
