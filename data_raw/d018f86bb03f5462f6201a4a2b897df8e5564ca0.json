            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by diffuse alveolar damage and is frequently complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH). Multiple factors may contribute to the development of PH in this setting. In this review, we report the results of a systematic search of the available peer-reviewed literature for papers that measured indices of pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with ARDS and reported on mortality in the period 1977 to 2010. There were marked differences between studies, with some reporting strong associations between elevated pulmonary arterial pressure or elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and mortality, whereas others found no such association. In order to discuss the potential reasons for these discrepancies, we review the physiological concepts underlying the measurement of pulmonary haemodynamics and highlight key differences between the concepts of resistance in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. We consider the factors that influence pulmonary arterial pressure, both in normal lungs and in the presence of ARDS, including the important effects of mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient (TPG) depend not alone on the intrinsic properties of the pulmonary vascular bed but are also strongly influenced by cardiac output, airway pressures and lung volumes. The great variability in management strategies within and between studies means that no unified analysis of these papers was possible. Uniquely, Bull et al. (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 182:1123-1128 have recently reported that elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and TPG were independently associated with increased mortality in ARDS, in a large trial with protocol-defined management strategies and using lung-protective ventilation. We then considered the existing literature to determine whether the relationship between PVR/TPG and outcome might be causal. Although we could identify potential mechanisms for such a link, the existing evidence does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Nonetheless, abnormally elevated PVR/TPG may provide a useful index of disease severity and progression. Further studies are required to understand the role and importance of pulmonary vascular dysfunction in ARDS in the era of lung-protective ventilation.",

Multivariate analyses showed them to be independent predictors of mortality in ARDS [5] . They used the term 'pulmonary vascular dysfunction' to describe these two variables. Covariates in their multivariate analyses included sex, race, age, APACHE II score, the presence of shock at baseline, level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio and fluid treatment strategy. They did not find any difference in P:F ratios, PASP, PADP, mPAP, PAOP or cardiac index between those who survived with ARDS and those who did not. The Pplat and PEEP levels were not different among the groups. It is worth noting that 21% of the screened patients were excluded because they had a pulmonary artery catheter in place at the time of randomization and that 30% of the enrolled patients showed a PAOP > 18 mmHg at enrollment, therefore not meeting the ABC definition of ARDS.

An increase in pulmonary arterial pressure results in an increased flow due both to the higher driving pressure and the distension of the vessels so that the diameter of the vascular lumen is increased. Thus, increases in pulmonary arterial pressure have a disproportionate effect on pulmonary blood flow.",

This contributes to In the systemic circulation, the mean pressure (P)-flow (Q) plot is well described as a linear (Ohmic) relationship. The two points identified (open circles) show a normal cardiac output and a reduced cardiac output, respectively, in the hypertensive condition. At each of these cardiac outputs, it is clear that the ratio of P to Q is the same and therefore can be used to easily characterise the resistance of the systemic circulation. (B) In the pulmonary circulation, the plot of mean pressure against flow is curvilinear with an intercept on the pressure axis that is equal to left atrial pressure. The blue curve represents a normal pressure flow curve (healthy lung), while the red curve represents pressure flow curve in the presence of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The two points identified (open circles) show a normal cardiac output and a reduced cardiac output, respectively, in the hypertensive condition. At each cardiac output the pulmonary vascular resistance, (Ppa-LAP)/Q, is illustrated as the slope of the straight dashed line. Even though the two points are each on the same pressure flow curve, the calculated pulmonary vascular resistance is different at the different cardiac outputs.

Nineteen had macrothrombi in the pulmonary arterial and capillary vessels [38] . They also found endothelial injury in all stages of ARDS in all cases on both standard histological preparations and electron microscopy. There is now ample evidence supporting the concept of lung injury causing local, as opposed to systemic, coagulation in ARDS [28, 39, 40] . Tissue factor (TF) is released from endothelial cells that have been injured, in response to a variety of proinflammatory stimuli [41] . TF is a strong activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade. Increased activation of procoagulant processes occurs in the lung in ARDS and does not result from the systemic activation of coagulation (such as is seen in sepsis) [42, 43] . Animal data suggest that blockade of the TF-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex may reduce the degree of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS [44] . Levels of protein C, a natural anticoagulant, are also reduced in ARDS [45] while levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 are increased in ARDS patients, and both are prognostic of increased mortality in ARDS [46] . More recently, biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation have been shown to provide good discrimination for the diagnosis of patients with ARDS [47, 48] , and analysis of SARS-CoV infection in laboratory models has shown that the delicate balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis is shifted towards fibrin deposition during infection leading to ARDS [49] . Therapies targeting this pulmonary coagulopathy may also have an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate the severity of ARDS [50] .",

In the late stage, vascular remodelling was associated with distorted, tortuous arteries and veins. These tortuous channels were concentrated in regions of dense or irregular fibrosis. The number of capillaries was reduced, and they were often dilated. Muscularisation of the arteries was identified in the intermediate phase and was very marked in the late phase. This mechanical disruption of the course of blood vessels is likely to contribute to the sustained elevation in PVR seen in non-survivors.",

When PEEP is applied to a diseased lung, the change in PVR is determined by the balance between overdistension of lung units and recruitment of areas with previously low numbers of open alveoli. When the number of open alveoli increases following a recruitment manoeuvre and application of high PEEP, then PVR may even fall in keeping with Whittenberger's-U shaped relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance and lung volume. Any increase in ventilated alveolar area may also reduce HPV. Canada et al., found that the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) was lowest at 5 cm H 2 O in the normal lung but 10 cm H 2 O had to be applied to the injured lung in order to achieve minimal PVRi [58] . Above 'optimal PEEP' levels, the PVR increased, presumably due to compression of intra-alveolar capillaries by the increased airway pressure resulting in an increase in zone 1 and 2 characteristics [23, 59] .",

This reflects what we know of the pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism, but the evidence is not as definitive in ARDS. The presence of ACP has not been consistently demonstrated to be associated with excess mortality in ARDS in the modern era of protective ventilation. Perhaps this is because the authors modified their approach to mechanical ventilation in these studies when ACP was recognised, in order to limit the distension of the right ventricle by reducing the airway pressures (PEEP and plateau) and putting the patient in a prone position [17, 21] . Recent echocardiographic derived data on right ventricular dysfunction from Boissier et al. [20] suggest that even when tidal volume and plateau pressure are limited in line with best practice, the incidence of ACP in ARDS is still 22% and is independently associated with mortality in spite of greater use of prone positioning and nitric oxide. Lheritier et al. [21] found a similar incidence of ACP (22.5%) in moderate to severe ARDS patients ventilated with a lung protective strategy, but they could not find an association between the presence of ACP and outcome. In both studies, the groups with ACP had a higher use of nitric oxide and prone positioning compared to those without ACP. It is unclear what accounts for the different findings in these studies.",

This suggests that excessive HPV may contribute to the development of acute oedema, possibly by redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from areas with high degrees of HPV to other sections of the lung, with resultant hyper-perfusion, endothelial injury and capillary leak.

Many of the mechanisms of PVD in ARDS (the release of multiple vasoactive mediators, vascular remodelling and the formation of vasoocclusive microthrombi) are caused by the disruption of the normal endothelial-inflammation-coagulation pathways. PVD may be a good summative index of vascular damage from these mechanisms. Nuckton et al. has previously reported that an increased dead space fraction was associated with increased mortality in ARDS [77] , which they postulated might be due to injury to the pulmonary capillaries from inflammation and thrombosis and obstruction of pulmonary blood flow in the extraalveolar pulmonary circulation. There is evidence that extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction in ARDS is caused by the systemic inflammatory response, which in turn is driven by the initiating pulmonary injury [78] . If PVD is primarily a downstream result of the activation of the inflammatory-coagulation cascade in the lung, then, the reason it is associated with mortality in ARDS may be because it reflects the severity of the underlying inflammatory process. This hypothesis may also help to explain why PVD is associated with mortality in wellcontrolled studies of patients with ARDS whereas right ventricular dysfunction has not been consistently shown to be associated with mortality.",

In order to develop new treatments for ARDS, we need better methods for examining their efficacy. Using PVD as an endpoint might improve the predictive value of phase II trials prior to embarking on full scale clinical studies of new treatments.
