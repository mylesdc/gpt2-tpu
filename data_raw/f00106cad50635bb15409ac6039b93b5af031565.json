Many emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are zoonoses derived from wildlife, particularly bats [1, 2] . Bats are now recognized as a major reservoir of zoonotic agents. High profile examples include the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah) [3] [4] [5] , severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus [6, 7] , Ebola virus [8] and most recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [9, 10] . The significance of bats as a reservoir for zoonotic viruses was first recognized with the emergence of Hendra virus (HeV) in northern Australia in 1994. In two independent spillover events, HeV claimed the lives of 15 horses and two humans [3, 4] . Approximately four years after HeV emerged, a related paramyxovirus, designated Nipah virus (NiV), emerged in farmed pigs in Malaysia. Between 1998 and 1999, this virus claimed the lives of 105 humans and resulted in the culling of over one million pigs [5] . NiV outbreaks occur annually in Bangladesh with cases of direct human-tohuman transmission also reported. Bats of the Pteropus genus are the natural reservoir of both HeV and NiV.",

Some rabies-like viruses are the notable exception [11, 12] . The mechanism by which bats control viral replication remains largely unknown. Despite the absence of clinical disease, bats are capable of shedding virus and triggering subsequent zoonotic transmission. This situation implies bats are capable of controlling viral replication, but not eliminating it. Studies on Ebola have demonstrated that bat lung fibroblasts (derived from the Mexican free-tailed bat) are capable of maintaining a low-level persistent infection with wildtype Ebola Zaire [13] . Recent studies have demonstrated that genes involved in innate immunity have evolved rapidly under positive selection within the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), indicative of coevolution between virus and host [14] . However, indepth knowledge about the antiviral response of bats is still lacking, as are the reagents necessary to study these non-model species. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by comparing the response of P. alecto with humans following HeV infection. As the natural reservoir of HeV, P. alecto remains clinically asymptomatic. By contrast, zoonotic transmission of HeV to horses and humans is often fatal [15] .",

A draft genome sequence for the P. alecto was released in 2013 [14] . However, to date, no studies have examined the antiviral response of this species -or any other bat species -to infectious viruses at either the transcriptome or proteome level. The study of infectious agents in any non-model organism by high-throughput techniques is severely constrained by the quality and availability of gene model annotations, particularly in the field of proteomics. While the draft P. alecto genome was annotated using a combination of homology, de novo prediction and transcriptomics [14] , continual refinement is necessary. To circumvent the reliance on high-quality annotation models, we recently developed proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) analysis. This technique collects RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) and quantitative high-throughput proteomics data simultaneously, then uses the transcriptomic data to refine and inform the proteomics analysis. We have previously demonstrated that this combined approach sidesteps the issue of bioinformatics annotation and enables the analysis of any species on a similar footing to humans [21] .",

By contrast, PaKiT03 cells initially underwent activation of NF-kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) at 8 hpi, followed by the induction of extrinsic apoptosis pathways at 24 hpi. Further analysis of the responses after 48 and 72 h of HeV infection revealed that PaKiT03 cells, but not HEK293T cells, underwent apoptotic cell death. In addition, our study provides proteomic evidence for over 5,000 genes in the P. alecto genome, including several hundred previously unannotated genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the transcriptional and proteomic response to HeV in any cell type. Furthermore, this study represents the first side-byside transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of a single virus in two relevant host species.

Differential expression analysis of de novo assembled transcripts revealed that the overall response to HeV was distinct between cell lines (Figure 2A ). In the PaKiT03 cells, HeV infection induced the expression of over 200 transcripts at 8 hpi and over 600 transcripts at 24 hpi (Figure 2A , Additional file 1). By contrast, only 8 and 31 transcripts were up-regulated at 8 and 24 hpi in the HEK293T cells (Figure 2A , Additional file 1). In both cell lines, many of the transcripts induced at 8 hpi remained up-regulated at 24 hpi. The proteomic response also differed significantly between the two cell lines ( Figure 2B ). Most notably, in HEK293T cells over 1,500 proteins were downregulated at 24 hpi, whereas only 213 proteins were downregulated in PaKiT03 cells at this time point (Additional file 1). Of the 100 proteins that were significantly induced in PaKiT03 cells at 8 and/or 24 hpi, 17 were also significantly up-regulated at the mRNA level (Additional file 1). Many of these proteins have proven roles in innate immunity, including the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene ISG20, receptors CD40 and CD44, and complement component C3. By contrast, no proteins were up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA level in the HEK293T cells. Furthermore, with one exception in the PaKiT03 cells (SLC12A2), the proteins down-regulated at 8 and/or 24 hpi were not significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level for either cell line.

We used the RNAseq data to de novo derive transcripts for both cell lines. All PaKiT03 and HEK293T Trinity transcripts with >70% similarities to the same human gene were obtained by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Over 10,000 orthologous transcripts were identified by this strategy (Additional file 4). We first examined the correlation in baseline mRNA expression (at 0 hpi) between the cell lines ( Figure 3A ). Because SILAC is a relative quantification method we could not compare the baseline protein expression between the cell lines. A Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.75 demonstrated that orthologous transcripts showed similar baseline mRNA expression prior to HeV infection. Despite this, at 8 and 24 hpi the correlation in mRNA expression between orthologous transcripts fell significantly ( Figure 3B ). Similarly, at the protein level there was poor correlation in relative protein abundance of orthologous transcripts at 8 and 24 hpi ( Figure 3C ). Moderate agreement in mRNA fold change and relative protein abundance was, however, observed between 8 and 24 hpi within each cell line ( Figure 3B ,C). A heatmap of all orthologous transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed -at one or more time pointconfirmed that the response was similar at 8 and 24 hpi within each cell line, but differed between cell lines ( Figure 3D ).",

Many of the up-regulated PaKiT03 transcripts and proteins were mapped to TNF signaling (ko4668), NF-\u03baB signaling (ko04064) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (ko04060) pathways ( Figure 4B , Additional file 6). A subset of transcripts involved in apoptosis and TNF signaling ( Figure 4C ), including TNFRSF10A (DR4), TNF RSF11B, CD40 (also known as TNFR5), CASP13 and TNFAIP3 (A20), were chosen for validation using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In all cases, the differential expression was confirmed, although the magnitude of the fold change was less by qPCR compared to RNAseq ( Figure 4D -H). Due to the paucity of bat specific and cross-reactive antibodies, we could only examine the expression of two proteins -CD40 and TNFAIP3 -by Western blotting in the PaKiT03 cells. CD40 was up-regulated over two-fold at the protein level in the SILAC analysis ( Figure 4I ). No peptides were found for TNFAIP3 within the SILAC analysis, however considering its mRNA was significantly up-regulated, we examined its protein expression with Western blot nonetheless. Both proteins demonstrated differential expression at either 8 and/or 24 hpi, similar to their mRNA expression ( Figure 4J ).

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important mechanism by which the host can eliminate virus-infected cells. Apoptosis can be triggered through intrinsic (mitochondrial-dependent) or extrinsic signaling pathways. In the present study, a number of genes/proteins involved in the extrinsic TNF receptor-associated inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway were induced at 24 hpi in the PaKiT03 but not HEK293T cells ( Figure 4C ). TRAIL-mediated apoptosis occurs through binding of the trimerized ligand to its functional death receptor (DR4/TNFRSF10A or DR5/TNFRSF10B). This is followed by recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain, mediated through a death domain, which induces the sequential activation of caspase 8 (from its pro-caspase precursor) and caspase 3, ultimately leading to apoptosis-mediated cell death ( Figure 6A ). A single peptide derived from the P. alecto TRAIL protein was found to be induced over 2-fold at 24 hpi in the PaKiT03 cells ( Figure 6B ). The fact that TRAIL is often secreted as a soluble form could explain why we only observed a single peptide. This peptide was detected when spectra were searched against the P. alecto official UniProt list of proteins and not the Trinity transcriptome-derived protein list. Furthermore, mRNA up-regulation of the functional TRAIL receptor (TNFRSF10A/DR4) was demonstrated by RNAseq and qPCR at 8 and 24 hpi ( Figure 4E ). In a longer time course experiment we demonstrated that TNFRSF10A/ DR4 mRNA, but not TRAIL, was further induced at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 6C ). A transcript encoding the pro-apoptotic enzyme caspase 13 was also induced at 8 and 24 hpi in the PaKiT03 cells ( Figure 4D ). Caspase 13 mRNA was also further induced at 48 and 72 hpi in the PaKiT03 cells ( Figure 6C ). Other genes and proteins with proven roles in intrinsic apoptosis processes, such as bcl2 binding component 3 (BBC3) and baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), were also induced in PaKiT03 cells in response to HeV ( Figure 4C ).",

TNF RSF11B was induced at the mRNA level at both 8 and 24 hpi ( Figure 4F ). To further examine the role of antiapoptotic components, a long time course experiment was performed on PaKiT03 cells. TNFRSF11B continued to be up-regulated at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 6C ). Acting as a decoy receptor, TNFRSF11B is capable of inhibiting TRAILmediated apoptosis as well as NF-\u03baB activation. In a similar vein, TNFIAP3 also inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis in certain cells, through poly ubiquitination of the receptorinteracting protein 1 (RIP1) and inhibition of caspase 8 cleavage. In this study TNFIAP3 mRNA was significantly induced at 8 and, to a lesser extent, 24 hpi in PaKiT03 cells, but not in HEK293T cells ( Figure 4H ). Western blot of TNFIAP3 revealed an increase in protein abundance at 8 hpi in bat cells ( Figure 4J ). TNFIAP3 itself is an NF-\u03baBactivated protein that plays an important role in suppressing NF-\u03baB activity through a negative feedback mechanism. Again, no differential expression of TNFIAP3 mRNA/protein was observed in the HEK293T cells.",

Apoptosis was was observed in the HEK293T cells, which further decreased at 72 hpi (P <0.01). At 72 hpi the PaKiT03 cells decreased in viability by approximately 50% (Figure 6D) . A significant increase in caspase 3/7 was observed at 48 and 72 hpi in the PaKiT03 compared to uninfected cells (P <0.01; Figure 6E ). By contrast, no increase in caspase 3/7 was observed in HEK293T cells at any time point. Furthermore, we observed no cleavage of PARP1 in HEK293T cells at 8 or 24 hpi ( Figure 6F ). The observation that HeV significantly reduces cell viability of HEK293T cells after 24 hpi meant it was not possible to examine the apoptotic response after this time using either PARP1 Western blotting or TUNEL. TUNEL staining of HeV-infected PaKiT03 cells at 24 and 48 hpi demonstrated an increased number of apoptotic cells at 48 hpi ( Figure 7A ). This is in agreement with results from the caspase 3/7 assay. In most cases, TUNEL-positive cells were also infected with HeV at 48 hpi. TUNEL staining of HeV-infected HEK293T could only be performed at 0 and 8 hpi. After this time point HeV infection caused many cells to detach from the coverslips. TUNEL staining at 0 and 8 hpi revealed no apoptotic HEK293T cells ( Figure 7B ). This finding is consistent with the lack of PARP1 cleavage at 8 and 24 hpi in HEK293T cells. Weak cytoplasmic staining was observed in some HEK293T cells, but given we observed no nuclear staining (as seen in PaKiT03 and the DNase control) we concluded this was the result of non-specific background staining. The human PARP1 antibody was not crossreactive in the bat cells, and so this method could not be used.",

Owing to the poorly characterized nature and paucity of primary bat cell lines, we concentrated on well-characterized immortalized cell lines from P. alecto. Apoptosis was assessed by the Caspase-Glo\u00ae3/7 luminescence assay. Following HeV infection we observed significant increased caspase 3/7 activities in P. alecto fetus cells (PaFeB5) and, to a lesser degree, brain cells (PaBrT03). Activities in both of these cell types were highest at 48 hpi (P <0.01, Figure 8A ). In contrast to our previous observations in HEK293T cells, the human embryonic fibroblasts (HEF) and HeLa cells demonstrated a strong increase in caspase 3/7 activities at 24 hpi (P <0.01; Figure 8B ).

The ability of bats to maintain asymptomatic viral infections whilst the same agent often causes fatal infections in human is a typical feature of bat-borne zoonotic viruses. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this dichotomy remain unknown. Despite the absence of clinical disease, the fact that bats can shed and transmit viruses suggests bats are capable of controlling viruses, but not eliminating them all together. Rapid induction of the innate immune processes has been proposed as one possible mechanism for subduing viral replication in bats [19] . Considering the importance of bats as natural reservoirs for many emerging viruses, elucidating the mechanisms by which bats control viral replication will be invaluable to the field of emerging infectious diseases. In addition, system-wide analysis of human responses to infection only provides a picture of the pathways affected during a pathogenic infection. Ideally we would like to have a system-wide comparison between a pathogenic and nonpathogenic response to the same infectious agent. With this in mind, we compared the transcriptome and proteome responses of immortalized kidney cells from human and bat following HeV infection using our recently developed integrated systems-wide approach. The PaKiT03 and HEK293T cells examined in this study responded very differently to HeV. Even when only high confidence orthologous transcripts are considered, the transcriptomic and proteomic response was significantly different -despite the similar expression profiles of orthologs at 0 hpi. Human HEK293T cells appeared to show little response at 8 hpi, followed by a largely suppressive response at 24 hpi. PaKiT03 cells, however, demonstrated a strong activation of several immune pathways at 8 and 24 hpi, followed by the induction of extrinsic apoptosis at 24 hpi and beyond.",

Induction of the innate immune response often leads to the activation of apoptotic processes, typically through members of the TNF family. We have demonstrated that, following HeV infection, PaKiT03 cells up-regulated components of the TRAILmediated apoptosis pathway. By contrast, the HEK293T cells appeared to either down-regulate a number of proapoptotic proteins or up-regulate anti-apoptotic components. Induction of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis following viral infection of human cells has been reported previously. In most cases, viral infection induces the expression of the death receptors DR4 and DR5, which in turn sensitizes the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis [24, 25] . Infection of human cells with hepatitis C and mammalian reoviruses induces mRNA and protein expression of the functional TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 [24, 26] . Paramyxoviruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus have also been shown to induce expression of DR5 and DR4 in human lung cells [25] . In the PaKiT03 cells, we observed a greater than two-fold increase in TNFRSF10A/DR4 mRNA expression at 24 hpi. Interrogation of the P. alecto genome along with our de novo assembled transcriptome suggested that, like mice, bats contain only one functional death receptor. TNFRSF10A/DR4 may therefore act as the sole functional TRAIL receptor in bats.",

Viruses such as measles and respiratory syncytial virus induce functional TRAIL expression in human cells [25, 28] . Here, we observed a significant increase in TRAIL protein expression at 24 hpi in the bat cells. The activation of NF-\u03baB pathways within the bat cells, including the upregulation of CD40, NFKB2 and RelB transcripts, may have contributed to the increased TRAIL protein expression. Surprisingly, we observed no increase in TRAIL mRNA at 8, 24, 48 or 72 hpi within the PaKiT03. This finding suggests that the regulation of TRAIL protein expression possibly occurs post-transcriptionally. By using previously collected lung and kidney tissue samples from HeV-infected bats, we examined the expression of TRAIL and CD40 mRNA in the context of an in vivo infection. While no increase in CD40 mRNA expression was observed in either kidney or lung, we found an approximately five-fold up-regulation of TRAIL mRNA in bat lungs infected with HeV for 60 h. Previous, unpublished data from this trial demonstrated that the HeV antigen could only be detected in the lung tissue at 60 hpi through immunohistochemistry (M. Baker, unpublished data). The coordinated up-regulation of TRAIL mRNA at the site of HeV infection within the natural host highlights the importance of TRAIL in HeV infection in vivo.",

The treatment of cells with human recombinant TRAIL and subsequent HeV infection demonstrated that HeV sensitizes PaKiT03 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis at 24 hpi. Presumably, this 'sensitivity' is achieved through the increased expression of TNFRSF10A/DR4 as discussed above. A similar observation was made by Clarke et al. [24] , where reovirus infection increased the sensitivity of human cells to apoptosis by increasing the expression of DR4 and DR5. In the present study, HEK293T cells showed no increased susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis following HeV infection. Importantly, we showed that this finding is not a general feature of human HEK293T cells. Indeed, when we treated these cells with human recombinant TRAIL and infected them with NBV, we saw an increase in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (evidenced by increased caspase 3/7 activity). We can therefore conclude that the HEK293T cells are indeed capable of TRAILinduced cell death, but for unclear reasons this process does not occur in response to HeV.",

The V protein of mumps virus is also known to block IFN expression [35] . When we compared the HeV transcription profile between the cell lines, there appeared to be fewer transcripts for the P/V/W region in human cells compare to bat cells. Considering the important role of the V protein in immune evasion, this transcriptional variation may influence the host response, particularly in regard to IFN production. Phenotypically, we also observed differences in the cytopathic effect between human and bat cells following HeV infection at 24 hpi. Extensive syncytia were observed in the human but not bat cells. Cell fusion and syncytia are mediated by the HeV-F protein. It is therefore interesting to note that we observed higher abundance of F transcript in the human cells compared to bat cells.

A number of transfection studies have demonstrated that the henipavirus P gene products (P, V, W and C) can inhibit both the IFN induction and IFN signaling pathways in human cell lines (including HEK293T and 2fTGH) [36, 37] . More recent studies on HEK293T cells, however, have shown that, while productive henipavirus infection can effectively block IFN production after 3 hpi, it only partially blocks IFN signaling, as measured by the expression of ISGs at 24 hpi [38] . Similar studies on a range of P. alecto cell types, including lung (PaLuT02), primary kidney (PaKi) and fetus (PaFe and PaFeT) [39] , demonstrated that both IFN production and signaling were blocked by henipavirus infection at 3 and 24 hpi, respectively [40] . By contrast, our findings demonstrate that in human HEK293T cells IFN production and signaling occur at 24 hpi, thus suggesting the host is capable of overcoming the antagonistic effects of HeV at this later time point. It is worth noting that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), an important transcription factor responsible for IFN-\u03b2 induction, was down-regulated at the protein level at 24 hpi in human cells. This finding is somewhat at odds with the induction of IFN-\u03b21 at 24 hpi in human cells. NiV has been shown to block IFN production through the accessory V and W proteins by targeting IRF3 [41] . While HeV may use a similar mechanism, a two-fold reduction in IRF3, as observed in this study, does not appear sufficient to completely abolish IFN production in human cells. IFN antiviral response is also mediated to some degree by the Ras/MAPK pathways. Studies of persistent Ebola virus (Mayinga strain) infection of bat lung fibroblasts found that activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which antagonizes the IFN response, was required for productive infection [13] . In the present study, we found many of the downregulated transcripts/proteins in the human cells were mapped to MAPK pathways. Inactivation of these pathways may have contributed to the increased IFN response observed in human cells at 24 hpi.",

The major differences in response between the bat and human cells may to some degree simply reflect differences in cell type. In any mammal, it is highly likely that not all cell types will respond to viral infection in a similar fashion. Furthermore, mechanisms deduced from cell lines may not reflect what occurs in vivo. With this in mind, we stress that caution must be taken when extending conclusions from in vitro studies (such as ours) to other cell types, and more generally in vivo models. However, in vitro studies provide significant insight into host mechanisms at the molecular level, ultimately generating numerous hypotheses that can be investigated within appropriate models in vivo. Indeed, in vitro studies are necessary (at least in the first instance) when examining a highly pathogenic virus (such as HeV) that requires high levels of bio-containment.",

This is the first time a single virus has been comprehensively analyzed by RNAseq and high-throughput quantitative proteomics in cells lines from two species. For the first time, we can compare at a systems level, the response between a resistant reservoir host (bat) and a susceptible spillover host (human). By identifying the crucial cellular pathways whose differential activation correlates with outcome, we open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, through testing the many pathway-specific licensed drugs already available. Moreover, our approach enables side-by-side comparison of any mammal with humans to determine how similar or divergent two species are when they are infected with a virus or exposed to a drug (or both). In principle, this could guide better selection of animal models and improve our ability to predict how humans will respond to treatments developed in animal models. Finally, our dataset provides transcriptomic and proteomic evidence of approximately 5,900 genes and proteins. This includes evidence for nearly several hundred genes and proteins not listed in the UniProt dataset for P. alecto. This represents a major leap forward in our understanding of the genetic content of bats -significant natural hosts of current and potentially future zoonotic agents.",

Human HEK293T cells demonstrated little early response followed by a global suppression of mRNA and protein abundance. Bat PaKiT03 cells, by contrast, demonstrated a robust innate immune response, which led to the execution of extrinsic TRAIL apoptosis pathways. At 48 and 72 hpi, PaKiT03 cells, but not HEK293T cells, demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. However, when further cell lines from bats and humans were examined, we found that at least some human lines (HEF and HeLa) were susceptible to HeV-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, examination of tissue samples from HeV-infected bats failed to reveal widespread apoptosis at least for the spleen and kidneys. Notwithstanding this, we have shown how to compare the response of two distinct species to the same infectious agent using RNAseq and high-throughput quantitative proteomics. We have used this analysis to highlight the potential to identify and test pathways that in principle could have a significant bearing on the outcome of disease. We believe this approach will enable the identification and investigation of pathways that contribute at a molecular level to the devastating differential pathogenicity of zoonotic bat viruses when they infect humans.",

Finally, for each entry in the human UniProt list of proteins we selected the best match from the Trinity-derived ORFs for each species. In this way we were able to generate a master list of transcripts and ORFs that were the best matches to the human UniProt list of proteins. This approach allowed us to connect orthologous genes and ORFs from the human Trinity-derived transcripts to the P. alecto Trinity-derived transcripts and ORFs. We were then able to designate the P. alecto genes and proteins with their nearest human homologs, enabling a pathways analysis based on the assumption that all the identified P. alecto genes and proteins had direct human homologs (Additional file 4). Alongside this analysis, we examined the list of P. alecto Trinity-derived ORFs that had been identified as being real on the basis that at least one peptide from each ORF had been detected by the MaxQuant analysis. In essence, each transcript that generated an ORF identified by Max-Quant was compiled into a list of transcripts, ORF and peptide evidence for each ORF. We then used sequential BLAST searches to identify each ORF by searching against the P. alecto proteome and the human proteome (Additional file 10).

Membranes were washed three times (10 min each) with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in TBST. The following primary rabbit antibodies were used: CD40 (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA), A20 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) and \u03b22-tubulin (1:2,000, Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBST. Membranes were finally washed twice with TBST, once with TBS and developed with ECL-Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Cytopathic effects typical of HeV were observed after 24 hpi and increased at 72 hpi (data not shown). To account for the decrease in cell viability within infected cells, we first measured cell viability using a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescence assay and then normalized the caspase 3/7 luminescence to cell viability. As expected, cell viability decreased rapidly after 24 hpi in the HEK293T cells, but not in bat cells.

DNase I treatment was used as a positive control on HEK293T cells that demonstrated clear nuclear staining.
