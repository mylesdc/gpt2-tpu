Mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite, including antigenic variation and surface masking, have been implicated but not well defined. In this study, we defined the immunoglobulin-binding proteomes of S. japonicum using human IgG, IgM, and IgE as the molecular bait for affinity purification, followed by protein identification by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Several proteins situated at the tegument of S. japonicum were able to nonselectively bind to the Fc domain of host immunoglobulins, indicating a mechanism for the avoidance of host immune attachment and recognition. The profile of the immunoglobulin-binding proteomes provides further clues for immune evasion mechanisms adopted by S. japonicum.",

Mouse IgG was detected on the surface of both male and female intact adult worms using a laser confocal microscopy (Fig. 1a) . The fluorescence visualized using fluorescence microscopy was more intense on the surface of male worms compared with that of females (Fig. 1b) . Indeed, imaging of frozen sections using the laser confocal microscopy showed that the fluorescence signals were located on the outermost layer of the blood fluke (Fig. 1c) . Additionally, mouse IgM was also observed on the parasite surface (Fig. 2a) , and the adsorption of human IgG, IgM and IgE on the parasite surface was clearly observed (Fig. 2b-d) .

It is the second most devastating parasitic disease after malaria according to worldwide rates of both morbidity and mortality. In 2012, at least 249 million people and a large number of animals were infected in 78 countries, and an estimated 700 million people were at risk (WHO, February 2014). Schistosomiasis japonica is caused by parasitization with Schistosoma japonicum and is the only zoonotic schistosomiasis; therefore, it is the most difficult to control among the five schistosome species that infect humans 1 . Currently, praziquantel is the only drug that is effective for the treatment of the disease, and a large amount of work is still required to develop a vaccine that is able to control the disease effectively 2 .",

Nevertheless, although vaccines based on the membrane components or associated proteins have been extensively studied, little success has been achieved [2] [3] [4] . The fact that adult parasites can thrive within the mesenteric or vesicular veins of their hosts for decades indicates that the worms employ a variety of strategies to escape identification by the immune system. It has been hypothesized that schistosomal parasites evade host immune expulsion through surface masking, molecular mimicry, and the active modulation of host immune responses 5 . A variety of host molecules, such as immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex products, complement components, and blood group antigens, have been found on the surface of the worms [5] [6] [7] [8] . For example, the heavy chains of host IgM, IgG1, and IgG3 plus the \u03b1 -chain of the C3c/C3dg fragment of complement component C3 have been found on the tegumental surface of S. mansoni 7, 9 . Although the binding regions of the Igs and the mechanism by which the parasite inactivates C3 have not been characterized 10 , the acquisition of host components on its surface is believed to benefit the parasite by preventing host recognition.",

To identify the protein interactions with the host non-immune Igs, native proteins were extracted from adult S. japonicum and separately incubated with human IgG-, IgM-, or IgE-conjugated Sepharose beads. The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS following trypsinization. The MS/ MS spectra were searched against the S. japonicum protein database. Only the proteins detected more than twice within three replications that were not identified among the retrieved proteins in the control group were classified as part of their corresponding Ig-binding proteome. In total, 437 non-immune human immunoglobulin-binding proteins of S. japonicum were identified, with 243 proteins bound to IgG, 210 bound to IgM and 134 bound to IgE. Several proteins showed affinity for both IgG and IgM, while the proteins that bound IgE were much more selective (Fig. 3a) .

The pathology of schistosomiasis has been mainly attributed to constant egg deposition in the liver of infected individuals. Thus, elimination of the parasites in the veins is the optimal way to cure the disease. It has been known that adult worms can thrive in the mesenteric or vesicular veins for decades. However, although surface masking and antigenic variation have been implicated, the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used immunofluorescence to illuminate the surface of worms processing affinity for both mouse and human immunoglobulins. Then, we affinity-purified the proteins with host non-immune immunoglobulins 18 . Of the 437 schistosomal proteins identified, 243 bound to human IgG, 210 to human IgM, and 134 to human IgE; most of the proteins showed affinity for both IgG and IgM, while fewer showed affinity for IgE ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, most of the proteins could be categorized based on sequence features, including EF-hand motif, immunoglobulin motif, Ca 2+ binding motif, annexin superfamily, immunophilin, and complement binding motif, suggesting common properties of immunoglobulin binding among the proteins identified. Even though a number of proteins were predicted to be surface-exposed proteins, some of them might be exposed after the washing in the citrate buffer. For example, Sj22.6 was detected in the apical cytoplasm of the tegument of male and female worms of S. japonicum by immunofluorescence in an earlier report 19 . Thus further investigation are needed to definitively localize the proteins with uncharacterized features.",

The binding of these proteins with host immunoglobulins was confirmed using both an ELISA assay and a pull-down approach. Compared with ELISA assays, pull-down assays require higher affinity between the ligand and receptor due to the high stringency of particle precipitation and the associated washing steps. All of the selected proteins showed a high affinity for the IgGs of both humans and domestic animals and variable but reduced affinity for IgM, IgE and IgA ( Fig. 5 and Table 3 ). Previous studies on the antigen paramyosin of S. mansoni 6, [11] [12] [13] [14] and Sjc23 15 suggested that these proteins only adhere to the Fc domain of Ig; in agreement with this result, we found that all of the tested recombinant proteins bound the Fc domain except Sj31, which showed a slight affinity for the Fab domain ( Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It is likely that one of mechanisms schistosomal parasites escape host recognition is through binding to the Fc domain of immunoglobulins. One consequence of this Fc domain binding is that the reaction of complement activation and fixation is paralyzed due to the reduced availability of the paratope-epitope interaction of the Fab domain with the antigen, resulting in the unavailability of the complement binding domain. Furthermore, the complement receptor protein identified in the parasite (C1qBP) exhibited higher affinity for human IgG than for complement C1q, strongly suggesting that the parasite utilized non-immune Ig to block complement activation.",

            "text": "The identification of the immunoglobulin-binding proteome of S. japonicum not only confirmed the findings reported earlier but also extended the understanding regarding the function of the surface localized proteins of the parasite. For example, Sjc23, a member of the tetraspanin protein family, is a 23 kDa surface-exposed protein of S. japonicum that has been regarded as a potential candidate for a schistosomiasis vaccine. However, in our previous study we found that this protein elicited rapid humoral responses mediated by the IgG2a subclass after infection and did not provide protection against challenge with cercariae 16 . It was further determined that Sjc23 could bind to human non-immune IgG through the interaction of a 9-amino acid motif (-KIQTSFHCC-) with the Fc domain of human IgG 15 . This binding may be responsible for the rapid but biased immune response after immunization with the recombinant Sjc23 protein or parasite infection 16 . Hence, it was demonstrated that Sjc23 is a schistosomal molecule with IgG-binding properties that facilitates parasite immune regulation in a manner similar to that of paramyosin. In the current study, Sjc23 and paramyosin were enriched and identified, validating the coverage and veracity of the affinity-based purification approach. The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) is a large group of cell surface and soluble proteins involved in the recognition, binding or adhesion processes of cells. Members of the IgSF exhibit characteristic immunoglobulin-like folding, which is defined by two opposing antiparallel \u03b2 -sheets connected in a unique manner [20] [21] [22] . Some of the secreted or cell surface-localized members of the IgSF have been suggested to play central roles in regulating the adaptive and innate immune responses. An essential activity of the ectodomains of these proteins is the specific recognition of diverse cognate ligands 23 . For example, many members of the IgSF, including Fc\u03b3 RIIB, PIR-B, BTLA, PD-1 and KIR, have been defined as inhibitory receptors that mediate immunosuppression via binding to their specific ligands. Previous studies have shown that viruses and other pathogens that engage IgSF receptors contribute to the selection of humoral mediators of adaptive immunity [21] [22] [23] . However, the function of the schistosomal IgSF members and their interaction with the mammalian host immune system is still not understood. Here, the finding that this family of proteins selectively recognize and bind to host immunoglobulins, which are their homologous proteins, which suggests that they may lead to suppressive immunoreaction, and contribute to the inhibition of anti-schistosoma immunity as observed in other pathogens such as adenovirus, coronavirus, and reovirus 20 .",

Although proteins with EF-hand domains are commonly found in the cytoplasm and membranes 25 , they are rarely found in the tegument membrane, with the exception of trematodes, such as S. japonicum 26, 27 , S. mansoni 28 , S. haematobium 29 , F. hepatica 30 , F. gigantica and C. sinensis 31 . Here, 9 EF-hand domain-containing proteins were identified that possessed human Ig-binding capacity, and this finding was confirmed by further studies with recombinant proteins. The results suggested that EF-hand domain-containing tegument proteins perform specific functions in trematodes by interacting with host immune molecules. Binding of the ten proteins with human non-immune IgG using an ELISA assay. Purified human plasma IgG from individuals without schistosomiasis was applied to ELISA plates and used to evaluate the affinity of ten proteins for it. All ten proteins showed capacity for binding to human IgG. (c) Binding of the ten proteins with human non-immune IgG in the pull-down assay. Human IgG-Sepharose and His-tagged proteins immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose resin were used as bait to capture the fusion protein or human IgG, respectively. The affinity was detected by Western blot using the appropriate antibodies. The binding capacity of the ten proteins to human IgG was confirmed using both the IgG pull-down and His pull-down assays. (d) The binding of human IgG domains to the ten proteins in the pull-down assay. The Fab and Fc fragments of human IgG were incubated with fusion protein-conjugated particle. After washing, the binding was detected by Western blot. Sjc23-LED was used as a positive control for binding with the Fc fragment and a negative control for binding with the Fab fragment. An unrelated His-tagged protein was used as a negative control for the Fc fragment, and the purified Fab fragment was used as a positive loading control for detection. All ten proteins bound to the Fc fragment, while only Sj31 marginally precipitated the Fab fragment with a dim band. Table 3 .

M28, a 28 kDa membrane serine protease of S. mansoni, cleaves iC3b and can restrict attack by effector cells that utilize complement receptors (especially CR3); treatment with protease inhibitors can potentiate the killing of schistosomula by complement plus neutrophils [34] [35] [36] . It has been reported that the schistosomula stages of S. mansoni release an elastase-like serine protease that degrades IgE in both humans and rodents but not IgG in humans 37 . Proteases secreted by T. cruzi trypomastigotes can enzymolyze the Fc fragment of normal IgG, suggesting that the FcRs inhibit the cytotoxic effects of the classical pathway 38, 39 . Furthermore, a fraction (PSA-Fc + ) isolated from the suckers and tegument of E. granulosus protoscoleces was described to possess proteolytic activity specific for human IgG1 and IgG3 through Fc binding 40 . In the present study, we identified six cathepsins in S. japonicum that exhibited an affinity for human Igs. Specifically, Sj31, a cathepsin B-like cysteine proteinase, was confirmed to possess an affinity for human, porcine, and bovine IgG and human IgD. Similar to other Ig-binding proteins identified in this study, its binding target region is also the Fc domain of IgG, which supports its role in immunoevasion.",

Similar to paramyosin, Tpm is aconstitutive protein of the muscular tissue in schistosomes and is located in the worm epidermis 44 . Due to the numbers of tropomyosin isoforms in schistosomes, it is likely that Tpm induces a range of responses in the host. In a recent report analyzing SmTpm, 12 of 20 predicted splice variants from the four SmTpm genes of S. mansoni were detected, and four variants of TpmII (TpmII.4, 8, 3 and 7) were analyzed. The authors concluded that TpmII.3 interacted with IgE and that TpmII.7 interacted with IgG 4 45 . Here, we identified a variant of SjTpm that interacted with human, porcine and bovine IgG, and human IgM. Another study by our laboratory identified 25 predicted splice variants from the five SjTpm genes 46 ; however, identifying their target components and understanding their association with the immune response requires further studies. Annexin, which is also known as lipocortin due to its phospholipase A2 suppressive activity, is a common name for a group of cellular proteins found in eukaryotic organisms. Although they are cytosolic proteins that lack signal sequences, they have also been detected in extracellular fluids and are associated with cell surface membranes where they could be involved in anti-hemostatic and anti-inflammatory functions. Schistosomal annexins have previously been identified on the tegumental surface of the parasite and as excretory/secretory products by immuno-electron microscopy in both the schistosomula and adult stages of S. mansoni and S. bovis [47] [48] [49] . However, their functions are still unclear. Nine of the annexin proteins were found to be enriched in this study and the affinity of two members for host Igs was confirmed, implying a more cryptic function in immunoregulation.",

This system helps or \"complements\" the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. C1q is a glycoprotein that belongs to the collectin family and has the largest molecular weight among all complement molecules. C1q is the first component of the classical pathway of complement activation. The globular head of C1q exclusively binds to the CH2 domain of IgG molecules or to the CH3 domain of IgM to alter its conformation, leading to activation of the C1r and C1s proteases and the classical complement pathway. However, this activation occurs only after immunoglobulin binding in the form of immune complexes. Here, we verified that C1qBP could bind to both C1q and human IgG, with a stronger affinity for the latter than for the former. Moreover, human IgG could efficiently block the binding of C1q to C1qBP, potentially inhibiting complement activation and the classical complement pathway. Our real-time PCR results showed that C1qBP was expressed during all developmental stages of the parasite and was most abundant during the cercaria stage, implying that C1qBP may play a key role in protecting the juvenile parasites from immune attacks in the early period after invasion and maintaining this effect during other parasitic stages.",

Putative functions and sequence features were assigned using BLASTp against annotated proteins in the GenBank database, and the alignment was classified to be significant if the corresponding E values < 1E-5. The transmembrane proteins were predicted using TMHMM Server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) 52 . InterPro domains were annotated by InterProScan (Release 27.0), and functional assignments were mapped onto Gene Ontology (GO) 53-55 . Gene expression analysis. An oligonucleotide microarray was used to measure the expression patterns of the obtained Ig-binding proteins at four developmental stages (eggs, cercariae, hepatic schistosomula and adult worm pairs) in rabbits and at the adult stage in various hosts (rabbits, C57/BL6 mice, Balb/c mice and buffalo). The design and construction of the microarray, and the methods used for microarray hybridization and feature extraction have been previously reported 56 . Raw data and normalized gene level data from the array have been deposited in the public database Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession numbers for the platform GPL18617, and series GSE57143. Local BLAST searches were performed to identify the microarray sequences that corresponded to Ig-binding protein sequences used as query sequences. Genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed with expression fold-changes \u2265 2 between any two compared stages or hosts and P-values < 0.05 (one-tailed Student's t-test). All of the genes encoding the Ig-binding proteins expressed in the adult stage and a total of 200 genes differentially expressed during four developmental stages and 4 genes differentially expressed in four hosts were selected according to the above criteria. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 200 genes was performed to generate a heatmap using Cluster 3.0 software and Heatmap Builder 1.0 software 57 .",
