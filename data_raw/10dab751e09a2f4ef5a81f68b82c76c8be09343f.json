The host density threshold is a central concept in theoretical epidemiology and a common target of human and wildlife disease control programmes, but there is mixed evidence supporting the existence of thresholds, especially in wildlife populations or for pathogens with complex transmission modes (e.g. environmental transmission). Here, we demonstrate the existence of a host density threshold for an environmentally transmitted pathogen by combining an epidemiological model with a microcosm experiment. Experimental epidemics consisted of replicate populations of naive crustacean zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) hosts across a range of host densities (20-640 hosts l \u22121 ) that were exposed to an environmentally transmitted fungal pathogen (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Epidemiological model simulations, parametrized independently of the experiment, qualitatively predicted experimental pathogen invasion thresholds. Variability in parameter estimates did not strongly influence outcomes, though systematic changes to key parameters have the potential to shift pathogen invasion thresholds. In summary, we provide one of the first clear experimental demonstrations of pathogen invasion thresholds in a replicated experimental system, and provide evidence that such thresholds may be predictable using independently constructed epidemiological models.",

The importance of host density to the emergence and spread of infectious disease has been demonstrated in many disease systems [5] [6] [7] , but may be strongly influenced by environmental factors [8] . Apart from the influence of fluctuating environmental conditions, pathogen invasion thresholds may be difficult to measure in field populations as a result of data scarcity, lack of replicated experimentation and the effects of host ecology (e.g. behaviour, social structure) [9] .",

This has resulted in a body of theory and indirect evidence for invasion thresholds without direct experimental evidence. In epidemiology, in particular, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is a fundamental quantity that formalizes the threshold concept, providing a boundary between pathogen invasion (R 0 > 1) and pathogen extinction (R 0 < 1). Given that R 0 is a common target for vaccination and pathogen control efforts in both theoretical [13, 14] and applied [15, 16] contexts, it may seem counterintuitive that pathogen invasion thresholds have largely been examined in theoretical studies. However, the estimation of R 0 requires an epidemiological model capable of capturing host and pathogen dynamics, which is a challenging task for wildlife pathogens, or host-pathogen interactions occurring in fluctuating environments, as fluctuating environments can change infectious period, host susceptibility or host contact patterns.",

A necessary condition for a pathogen invasion threshold is the dependence of the rate of pathogen transmission on host density, such that invasion thresholds are theoretically predicted to be absent from systems with frequency-dependent transmission [20] . For environmental and densitymediated pathogen transmission, the existence of the pathogen invasion threshold can occur simply by high host density enhancing the probability that a host contacts an infected host or an environmental pathogen spore [21] . Further, changes to behaviour or host life history as a function of density could influence invasion thresholds. For instance, transmission of an environmentally transmitted pathogen could exhibit a threshold if hosts alter their contact patterns or feeding behaviour as a function of conspecific density. Despite the inherent difficulty in examining pathogen invasion thresholds in natural systems, the generation of a body of epidemiological theory concerning pathogen invasion without experimental demonstration creates a clear knowledge gap.",

Lastly, we examine how gradients of key epidemiological parameters can influence pathogen invasion thresholds, as many relevant parameters are subject to environmental conditions.

The stochastic model was used to examine the influence of demographic stochasticity on model outcomes, while the study of parameter space was a way to examine the influence of environmental variation. State transitions in the stochastic model (e.g. susceptible host to infected host) were stochastic, except for the loss of pathogen from the environment (\u03bc), which we modelled as a deterministic process. Stochastic simulations were computed using the next reaction method [2, 39] implemented in the adaptivetau R package [40] . Deterministic and stochastic realizations of the model were simulated for all sampled parameter combinations (as defined above) for 11 days, which corresponds to the invasion window examined in our experimental epidemics. The probability of pathogen invasion was based on the fraction of parameter combinations that resulted in at least one infected individual in deterministic and stochastic simulations. Confidence intervals were obtained from the binomial distribution, as pathogen invasion is a binary outcome. Pathogen invasion probability was quantified in the same manner for model simulations and experimental epidemics; the minimum criteria for pathogen invasion in this system is the infection of one individual (i.e. a completion of half the life cycle of the environmentally transmitted parasite). This is because the amount of pathogen spores used to initiate the experiment was more than an order of magnitude less than the number of pathogen spores an infected host produces. Thus, the infection of one individual would suggest that R 0 > 1, as the pathogen death rate cannot offset the contribution of pathogen spores produced by an infected host in the pathogen transmission term (u\u03b3 SP). This provides a clear link between invasion probability as defined by either the observation of one infected individual or R 0 > 1. For model simulations, pathogen invasion was defined both as R 0 > 1 and the observation of a single infection event within the pathogen invasion window considering parameter uncertainty as described above. This is the same invasion criterion we use for primary infection events in our experimental epidemics. Further, we obtained an analytical expression for the invasion threshold (one individual becoming infected before day 11) for the stochastic model (see electronic supplementary material).",

The obvious parameters that will have strong effects on pathogen invasion thresholds are those that influence pathogen transmission and loss of pathogen from the environment (i.e. two key aspects of R 0 ). To understand how specific parameters influence pathogen invasion thresholds, we examined model-predicted pathogen invasion thresholds along gradients of three key parameters present in R 0 , which correspond to pathogen transmission (\u03b3 and u) and pathogen mortality (\u03bc).

Only a handful of instances occurred in which an initial infection did not lead to subsequent pathogen invasion, with these instances corresponding to host population crashes. Pathogen invasion thresholds-defined either as R 0 > 1 or as the probability of observing one infected individual following pathogen exposure-predicted by model simulations were qualitatively similar to the observed pathogen invasion probability from experimental epidemics ( figure 2) . Specifically, the predicted pathogen invasion thresholds from deterministic and stochastic simulations largely overlapped with the binomial confidence intervals from experimental epidemics, in which the experimentally determined pathogen invasion probability appears to be a combination of deterministic and stochastic dynamics.

Qualitatively, changes to pathogen death rate (\u03bc) had less of an impact on the probability of pathogen invasion relative to pathogen transmission terms (u and \u03b3 ), suggesting that changes to environmental pathogen survival may not influence pathogen invasion nearly as much as changes to parameters related to pathogen encounter and transmission, such as host foraging rate or pathogen infectivity. While the stochastic model, and associated formula for the pathogen invasion probability, underestimates pathogen invasion probability at high initial densities, the rate of change is similar to observe how shifts in parameters could strongly influence pathogen invasion thresholds.",

            "text": "Combining replicated experimental infection trials with an epidemiological model, we have provided an experimental demonstration and theoretical justification for the existence of the pathogen invasion threshold for an environmentally transmitted pathogen. Predictions for the pathogen invasion threshold-defined as both R 0 > 1 and as the probability of observing a primary infection eventobtained from deterministic and stochastic realizations of our epidemiological model were qualitatively similar to experimental epidemics, suggesting that the invasion threshold may be estimated from a simple independently parameterized epidemiological model. However, we found no evidence for an upper threshold to pathogen invasion, as hypothesized in earlier studies [22] . Pathogen invasion thresholds may depend on environmental context, which we incorporated by allowing uncertainty in several key parameters (\u03b3 ), u, \u03b8 and \u03bc (see electronic supplementary material) and further examining the probability of pathogen invasion along gradients of host filtering rate (\u03b3 ), per spore infectivity (u) and pathogen death rate (\u03bc). The range of pathogen invasion thresholds obtained by exploring this parameter space suggests that small amounts of variability will probably not strongly influence pathogen invasion probability (figure 2), but that small directional changes to key infection parameters can exert stronger influence on pathogen invasion ( figure 3 ). Together, these findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of a critical threshold to pathogen invasion in an environmentally transmitted pathogen, showing consistency with both deterministic and stochastic model simulations that capture important features of super-critical pathogen transmission. Understanding the factors contributing to pathogen emergence remains a key goal of disease ecology and epidemiology. While previous studies have examined pathogen invasion thresholds of directly transmitted pathogens [44] , invasion thresholds of environmentally transmitted pathogens are less well understood [45] [46] [47] . Notably, while much theory has been developed examining invasion thresholds for environmentally transmitted pathogens [1, 46] , very few experimental tests of this theory have been performed [48] . The Daphnia host-pathogen model described in this paper may be generalizable to other environmentally transmitted pathogen systems [21] . For instance, an extension of our model could consider a pathogen that reproduces in the environment, or that is able to be transmitted through both direct host contact and from an environmental source [49] . Some environmentally transmitted pathogens may have dynamics similar to directly transmitted pathogens if the pathogen is short-lived and has limited dispersal [21, 50] . The host-pathogen system we examined is characteristic of this situation (see resulting waves of infection in electronic supplementary material, figure A4 ), in which transmission occurs in a small window immediately following host death, and environmental pathogen spores are relatively short-lived [31] .",

That is, while invasion probabilities from the deterministic model largely overlapped the experimental data, the sigmoidal shape of the relationship in experimental data was not captured by deterministic or stochastic realizations. Further, demographic stochasticity increased the probability that the pathogen would not invade either through host extinction or the pathogen degrading in the environment before it could result in a successful infection. However, our calculation of R 0 from parameters-measured independently of experimental trials-captured pathogen invasion in experimental trials quite well. Pathogen invasion thresholds may be more difficult to predict in natural populations where transmission may be environmentally dependent [27, 31, 51] , creating a challenge for future research efforts to accurately capture transmission and infection dynamics in natural populations.",

Evidence that invasion thresholds may shift as a function of environmental context is provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in our model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission (u and \u03b3 ), production of infectious spores (\u03b8 ) and pathogen demography (\u03bc). This generates a number of open questions concerning how environmental covariates, species interactions or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold. An understanding of how pathogen emergence may be influenced by environmental context is an important research area that may be informed through the use of controlled microcosm studies. Lastly, the incorporation of stochasticity into invasion threshold estimates, and the parametrization of models using existing data are both tools that could improve pathogen threshold estimation for wildlife and managed populations.

The probability of pathogen invasion (a) from deterministic and stochastic simulations compared to data from experimental epidemics. The darker blue shaded region in the upper panel corresponds to the analytical solution of the pathogen invasion probability for the stochastic model. Shaded regions correspond to binomial confidence intervals from model simulations, which sampled parameter values for u, \u03b3 and \u03b8 . From these model simulations, we calculated R 0 (b). Vertical grey line corresponds to the host density at which 50% of parameter combinations result in R 0 > 1, with corresponding dashed lines corresponding to 35% and 65% parameter combinations resulting in R 0 > 1.
