Human CCR4 + tumorbearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumorinfiltrating Ly-6G + FccRIIIa(CD16A) + murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4 + tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A + CD56 + NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells.",

Mycosis fungoides (MF), which is the most common and indolent form of CTCL, accounts for 50%-60% of CTCL cases [1] ; primary cutaneous CD30 + lymphoproliferative disorders, more specifically primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) -the second most common CTCL, accounts for circa 30%; and S\u00e9zary syndrome, which is an aggressive leukemic variant of CTCL, affects approximately 5% of patients. These patients exhibit significant immune dysfunction [2, 3] because of the global dysregulation of T cells, which is due to an unknown etiology [4, 5] . Bacterial sepsis is the terminal event in most patients with advanced cancer. Current therapies for patients with advanced CTCL, including its leukemic variant, are only palliative, and extensive long-term remissions are rare. The poor 5-year survival rate of these patients receiving existing therapies clearly emphasizes the need for the development of new targeted therapies in this fatal disease [6] .",

            "text": "Over the past few years, several studies have described the expression of chemokine receptors in the skin and blood of CTCL patients, including the uniformly high expression of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) [7, 8, 9, 10] . CCR4 is highly expressed in both leukemic CTCL including S\u00e9zary syndrome and in MF, both in the very early stages (patch and plaque stages) of the disease and in large cell transformations [7, 8, 10, 11, 12] . It is also expressed on circa 60% of PC-ATCL cells [1] . In a recently published consensus article regarding the classification of CTCL, it is clear that CCR4 is expressed in the vast majority of CTCL cells, regardless of their histological subtype [1] . On the other hand, expression of CCR4 is limited amongst non-malignant cells [13] . It is not present on neutrophils, monocytes, or B cells [14] . It is absent on na\u00efve T cells, and present on fewer than half of all memory T cells [15] . expression of CCR4 by tumor cells is associated with their skin involvement, CCR4 also has an important role in normal and tumor immunity [13, 14] . CCR4 is expressed at high levels on T regulatory cells (Tregs) that can migrate to tumor cells that secrete the CCR4 chemokines CCL17 and CCL21 to facilitate evasion from immune surveillance [16, 17] . High expression of the these CCR4 ligands has been detected in CTCL lesions [11] , breast cancer [16] , ovarian cancer [17] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [18] . Thus, targeted therapy against CCR4 may be an attractive treatment option for these malignancies, not only to directly kill the CCR4 + tumor cells, but also to overcome the suppressive effect of CCR4 + Tregs on the host antitumor immune response.",

Tumor targeting with a human mAb directed against tumor-associated markers, such as CCR4, might provide a powerful therapeutic strategy against CTCL. In this study, we used recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated antibody gene transfer into SCID-BEIGE mice to evaluate the effectiveness of h1567, a novel humanized anti-CCR4 mAb to inhibit CCR4 + tumor cell growth and increase survival. The CCR4-specific antibody gene was packaged into an AAV vector and then delivered by a single direct intravenous (i.v.) injection which leads to the endogenous synthesis and durable expression of therapeutic antibody levels for months. Intravenous delivery of this h1567 minibody-encoding AAV vector allowed for rapid and accurate assessment of its therapeutic potential, thereby avoiding ex vivo manipulations involved in the production and purification of therapeutic mAbs.",

Chang et al., in press). The resulting recombinant AAV8 vector was used for both in vitro protein synthesis and virus production for in vivo antibody gene delivery. In a pilot dosing study, nude mice received a single injection of two different concentrations of AAV8-h1567 via intravenous tail vein injection. Serum h1567 minibody levels were followed for 15 weeks. H1567 minibody levels rose for the first 2-3 weeks, reaching levels of circa 65 and 96 ug/ml for the low (0.8610 11 vg/mouse) and high (2.0610 11 vg/mouse) vector doses, respectively and then through the remaining weeks of the study leveled off at near peak levels for the high dosed vector and circa 1/3rd that level (,35 ug/ml) for the low dosed vector ( Figure S1 ).

As shown in Figure 1c , when examined under reducing conditions, the 11A and h1567 minibodies recovered from both in vitro and in vivo sources showed bands at the expected size for scFvFc, circa 60 kD. Analysis under non-reducing conditions showed dimer formation (mol wt circa 120 kD), thereby confirming that the minibodies were divalent in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 1c ). In addition, the ease of recovery of the AAV8-derived minibodies from serum using affinity purification on protein A, their reactivity on Western blot with the anti-human Fc antibody, and their stable dimer formation confirms the proper folding and structural integrity of their CH2-CH3 domains (Figure 1c and 1d ).",

As shown in Figure 3a , treatment with AAV8-h1567 and hPBMCs resulted in substantial tumor growth inhibition compared to AAV8-11A plus hPBMC treated mice. Quantitative monitoring of tumor growth by in vivo BLI correlated with visible tumor growth, further confirming the tumor growth inhibition effect of AAV8-h1567 compared with control group (Figure 3b) . A significant difference was observed between the control AAV8-11A and therapeutic AAV8-h1567 groups on days 40, 42, and 45 after tumor inoculation by caliper measurement and by days 25 and 38 by BLI (Figure 3a and b) .

The integrity of the minibodies was demonstrated biochemically in vitro and in vivo by several parameters including their CCR4 + binding activity, stable dimer formation and ease of recovery by protein A chromatography ( Figure 1 c and 1d) . This scFvFc minibody format may be ideal for experimental AAV8 delivery since conventional mAb expression is derived from heavy and light chain genes, and it can be difficult to achieve the balanced expression of two genes within a single AAV vector that has a small packaging capacity (less than 5 kb), although a 2A selfprocessing peptide and furin cleavage have been successfully used to drive the expression of full-length rat IgG [27, 28] . For cancer immunotherapy, scFvFc minibodies appear to be promising because they have been shown to be functionally comparable with full-length IgG and have been successfully used to treat various tumors in preclinical studies [29, 30, 31] . As an added benefit, along with their bivalent antigen-binding avidity and intact antibody effector functions, they comprise a single polypeptide chain that does not require balanced heavy and light antibody chain heterocomplex associations and have a smaller molecular weight for better tissue penetration compared with whole IgG molecules [32] .",

Treatment of CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor bearing mice with AAV8-h1567 and human PBMCs resulted in a marked increase in the number of tumorinfiltrating human CD56 + NK cells, suggesting that CD16A which is expressed on human NK cells is involved in this tumor cell killing through it's interaction with the Fc portion of h1567, a finding that has been experimentally confirmed through Fc mutagenesis studies (data not shown). Moreover, in vitro ADCC studies with purified human NK cells demonstrated a concentration dependent killing by h1567 (Figure 4c) . Thus the unifying observations from both treatment studies strongly suggest that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 is mediated, at least in large part, by ADCC through engagement of FccRIIIA on mouse neutrophils (model 1) and human NK cells (model 2). Since Fc gamma receptors (FccRs) of different types are present on a variety of effector cell populations, including NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils [33, 34] , it is possible that FccR engagement on other immune effector cells, not investigated in this study could also be involved.",

A recent trial with low dose alemtuzumab has shown complete remission in 50% of patients with refractory leukemic forms of the disease and without infectious disease complications although it was found completely ineffective in the treatment of MF [6] . A mAb to CD4 (GenMab) has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of MF by the FDA [38] . While both approaches are designed to eliminate CTCL cells, there can be significant adverse effects from either treatment. CD52 is expressed by virtually all T and B cells, and the elimination of all CD4-positive cells has well-known negative consequences [39] . Clonal malignant T cells in these CTCL patients express uniformly high levels of CCR4, but variable to low levels of other skin homing addressins, including CLA, CCR10 and CCR6. CCR7, which is also uniformly highly expressed on leukemic variants of CTCL with T CM phenotype, is not expressed on the phenotypic T EM cells that are found in MF skin lesions [7] . Thus, only CCR4 is uniformly expressed on all forms of CTCL and has a restricted expression pattern on normal T cells, including Tregs [40] . Indeed, a subset of malignant T cells in some CTCL have been shown to act as CCR4 + Tregs to suppress antitumor responses and may fuel disease progression [41] . A therapeutic mAb that could preferentially target all forms of the disease and reverse Treg mediated immune suppression would be a major advance in the effective therapy of CTCL. The activity of mAb1567 in abrogating Treg mediated suppression of T effector cell function is described elsewhere (DK. Chang et al., in press). MAb KM0761, is another humanized anti-CCR4 mAb that has shown promising results in CTCL animal studies [42] and in clinical trials for refractory Adult T-cell leukemia (ATLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PLCL) where good clinical activity without severe adverse side effects was seen [43, 44] . Our data support further exploration of the clinical potential of therapeutic mAbs that target CCR4 in CTCL.",
