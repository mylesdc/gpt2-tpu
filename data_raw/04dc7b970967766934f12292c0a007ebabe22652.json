            "text": "Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly (ICF) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessively inherited genetic condition. The majority of the affected individuals have mutations in the methyltransferase 3B gene (DNMT3B, OMIM 602900) on chromosome 20 leading to reduced DNA methylation of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 (1, 2) . Epigenetic dysregulation rather than a single gene defect determines the clinical phenotype. Although all body cells carry the same mutation, various tissues are differently affected due to varying degrees of DNA methylation. This is especially seen in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes where whole arm deletions, translocations, and multibranched chromosomes cause an abnormal gene regulation of B cell immunoglobulin isotype switching, lymphocyte activation, and migration (3). ICF patients suffer from recurrent gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections in early childhood due to the agammablobulinemia resulting in failure to thrive (4) . An intrinsic T cell defect has also been linked to the high frequency of opportunistic infections from pathogens such as with Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ), but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (5) . Typical clinical characteristics include the eponymous facial anomaly of epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, and a flat nasal bridge, as well as a delay in psychological and cognitive development. Treatment options are limited and consist primarily of supportive therapy such as substitution of immunoglobulins, prophylactic sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy, or antibiotic therapy (6) (7) (8) . Life expectancy of ICF patients is poor and prognosis is dependent on the frequency and severity of infections. A high proportion of reported ICF patients die at a young age (9) . Early IgG replacement and antibiotic prophylaxis can significantly improve patient outcomes (10). An early sustainable therapy for the immunodeficiency can dramatically better the disease course. The only curative treatment of the immune dysfunction is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), as described in isolated case studies (3, 7) . However, no long-term follow-up data are available to date.",

This variant has been previously described in ICF syndrome by Hansen et al. It consists of a point mutation (rs121908943) and an amino acid exchange from alanine to threonine. The variant has a minor allele frequency of A = 0.000008 (11) and a prevalence of less than 1/1,000,000. Hansen et al. described this variant among other mutations in the DNMT3B gene, while 105 control DNAs from unrelated healthy Caucasians in North America and the Netherlands did not carry this mutation (1).",

At the age of 2.5 months, his body weight was at 5,300 g (12th percentile) and the length was 59 cm (24th percentile) (CDC/WHO growth charts 2000). At the age of 4 months, the patient was admitted to the hospital for the first time with recurrent and prolonged respiratory infections of the lower and upper airways with hypoxemia. Laboratory workup revealed a bilateral bronchopneumonia positive for Parainfluenza virus type 1 and 3 and PJ, as well as purulent conjunctivitis and purulent otitis media perforans positive for Haemophilus influenzae. In the subsequent immunological diagnostics, a significantly reduced level of all immunoglobulin subclasses ( Table 1) and a normal B cell count with a lack of memory B cells were detected. T cell count and proliferation rate of CD4+ and CD8+ cells after mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin were normal. Bronchoscopy revealed normal anatomic proportions of the airways. The PJ pneumonia was treated with intravenous cotrimoxazole, corticosteroids, and oxygen supplementation. Subsequent regular intravenous immunoglobulins treatment and prophylactic cotrimoxazole prevented further severe pulmonary infections. In addition, the patient has typical facial dysmorphisms consisting of hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, epicanthic folds, and low set ears ( Figure 1A -pictures of the face). ICF syndrome was clinically suspected and confirmed with the cytogenetic analysis revealed whole arm deletions, translocations, and multibranched chromosomes due to the centromeric instability in chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 (Figure 2-karyogram) . The patient is the fifth child of consanguineous Moroccan parents, who are first cousins (Figure 1B-pedigree) . Three healthy older siblings (5-, 4-, and 2-year olds) developed normally. ICF in the siblings was excluded with normal blood levels of immunoglobulins and a normal karyogram. The oldest daughter of the family died of respiratory failure at the age of 5 months in Morocco, no further genetic or pathological diagnostics were performed post mortem. At the age of 5 months, he presented with a body weight of 6,600 g (8th percentile) and a length of 66 cm (37th percentile), failure to thrive was diagnosed (CDC/WHO growth charts 2000). At the age of 6 months, the patient underwent hematological stem cell transplantation from the healthy 5-year-old sister with a HLA match of 10/10 as donor. After the conditioning regimen consisting of thiotepa, treosulfan, and fludarabine, he received CD34+ cells (24.7 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg bodyweight). Cyclosporine A, methotrexate, and antithymocyte globulin were given as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (Figure 3) . Patients with ICF syndrome often display residual T cell function that may result in graft failure or rejection and are, therefore, subjected to reduced intensity conditioning (3) . Given the good performance status of our patient, a myeloablative conditioning with reduced toxicity was administered in order to achieve stable lymphohematopoietic engraftment with low risk of organ toxicity (12) .",

While a gender bias for ICF2 syndrome caused by a mutation in the ZBTB24 gene has been observed recently, ICF1 syndrome affects both genders equally making it even more plausible that the deceased daughter had the same genetic defect as our patient (13) .",

In case reports from the 1990s, only patients on Ig therapy survived to childhood, while others died within the first year of life from opportunistic infections (9) as described in nine ICF cases in France. Recently, Gennery et al. published the successful cure of the immunodeficiency by HSCT in three ICF patients, who received HSCT at the ages of 18 months, 2 and 4 years (3). Here, we report another case of successful HSCT in ICF syndrome that received HSCT at 6 months of age. HSCT itself is associated with a high risk of mortality due to short-term opportunistic infections and GvHD. Long-term side effects include chemotherapeutic toxicity such as liver or kidney dysfunction, growth retardation, infertility, and secondary malignancies (14) . Patients who had never received chemotherapeutic treatment beforehand usually have a better clinical outcome and can be transplanted successfully with few acute side effects as seen in patients with hemoglobinopathies or sickle-cell anemia (15, 16) .",

            "text": "Since severe infections significantly worsen patient outcomes after HSCT, we aim to perform HSCT in ICF syndrome as early as possible in an infection-free period. ICF syndrome is invariably associated with low or absent levels of immunoglobulins given the defective peripheral terminal B cell differentiation. Indeed, this could be treated with life-long IgG replacement. However, a number of these patients also display functional T cell immunodeficiency, as evidenced in our case by PJ pneumonia. Furthermore, recent studies from Rechavi et al. and Weemaes et al. highlight the fact that a T cell proliferation defect develops over time (4, 17) . As such, patients with ICF syndrome suffer from multisystem disease leading to long-term morbidity and substantial mortality. This usually stems from severe infections (i.e., in the GI tract) associated with growth retardation and limited life expectancy. Particularly in an advanced stage of the disease, HSCT is associated with a higher risk of mortality due to preexisting infections. Allogeneic HSCT is, therefore, an attractive therapeutic approach in those patients with signs of T cell immunodeficiency without severe preexisting morbidity and is usually recommended when an HLA-matched donor can be identified. Although the conditioning chemotherapy is accompanied by high toxicity, we believe the advantages of HSCT significantly outweigh the natural disease course in ICF. HSCT replaces all hematopoietic cells carrying the DNMT3B mutation and can thereby cure the immunodeficiency in ICF patients. Weemaes et al. and Hagleitner et al. examined the clinical features of ICF1 patients, which can help to predict clinical outcomes after HSCT (4, 7) . Recurrent infections and a higher risk for hemato-oncological malignancies are eliminated in our patient with HSCT, while a delayed neurological development or cortical atrophy with seizures are features that remain (4, 7) . During the immunosuppressive treatment and before reconstitution of the adaptive immune system, our patient suffered from recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This can be attributed to the posttransplantation immunosuppression and are expected to improve with time. While failure to thrive can be attributed to the high frequency of infections, we expect our patient to catch up on weight gain within the coming months. DNA methylation is a dynamic process that epigenetically regulates gene expression during development and other processes such as aging, cancerogenesis, or cell differentiation. The DNMT3B mutation was described to lead to altered epigenetic modifications of genes regulating development, neurogenesis, and immune function (18) . Since the DNA methyltransferase is an intracellular enzyme that is not secreted and taken up by the surrounding tissue, HSCT is not able to compensate for the enzyme deficiency in all other cell types of the body. A recent study shows next to the hypomethylation of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16, a global loss of methylation in ICF patients' fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lineages leads to significantly upregulated gene expression of the differentially methylated positions (19) . Although 181 of such regions were identified, it remains unclear, how and to which degree a given tissue is affected by the hypomethylation and to what extent this pattern changes during development. All these questions need to be answered before we are able to translate the molecular findings into the clinical phenotype. Nevertheless, we can speculate that an overactive gene expression might have a great impact on genes that are highly epigenetically regulated, such as those responsible for neurological development or germ line genes important in preventing cancer development. Both of which can still lead to delayed neurological development and a higher risk for malignancies in ICF patients even after successful HSCT.",
