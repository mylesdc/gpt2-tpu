After implementation of the system, the apparent overall shortened RT was mainly due to the shortening of personnel response time (PRT) and the time needed to draft a new questionnaire that incurred as personnel-system interface (PSI); PRT dropped from a fluctuating range of 9.8 ,28.8 days in the first four months to ,10 days in the following months and remained low till 2008 (0.8861.52 days). The PSIs for newly emerged infectious diseases were 2.6 and 3.4 person-hours for H5N1 in 2007 and chikungunya in 2008, respectively, a much improvement from 1142.5 person-hours for SARS in 2003. The duration of each rubella epidemic cluster was evaluated as public health impact and showed a shortening trend (p = 0.019) that concurred with the shortening of PRT from 64.8647.3 to 25.2638.2 hours per cluster (p,0.0001).",

It provided flexible tools and computer algorithms with friendly interface for timely data collection, integration, and analysis; as a result, it shortened RTs, filled in gaps of personnel lacking sufficient experiences, created a more efficient flow of response, and identified asymptomatic/mild cases early to minimize further spreading. With further development, AEIS is anticipated to be useful in the application of other acute public health events needing immediate orchestrated data collection and public health actions.",

During the multi-country outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, public health officers experienced difficulties in prompt data collection and analysis, due primarily to the lack of an efficient information system to integrate the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory information collected during the rapidly evolving epidemic phases in different epidemic settings [1] . Anticipating that similar difficulties would continue to hamper responses to future emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) undertook a comprehensive systemic review to identify public health deficiencies [1, 2] and subsequently underwent restructuring in the post-SARS era.",

To this end, a template questionnaire for each of the 56 IDs was first installed in AEIS (Table S1) . A bank of template questions ( Figure 1B step A1) was compiled, and each digitalized question was conformed to standardized elements and pre-set fields which were suitable for integration and analysis by the built-in algorithms; questions related to common epidemic scenarios could be grouped into modules for easy access to be assembled into new template questionnaire for future use in EIDs.",

It is worth noting that a large portion of the personnel time that made up QRT prior to AEIS has been transformed into PSI, i.e., computerassisted personnel time. Taiwan CDC managed ID-related health information by using three information systems: NDSS, central microbiological laboratory diagnostic system, and National Immunization Information System c (NIIS); for epidemic investigation, d pre-designed digital questionnaires were available for 18 notifiable diseases, and paper-based questionnaires had to be generated as needed each time for all other notifiable diseases. (B) After the application of AEIS: Template questionnaires (A2) for use in investigating all 56 notifiable diseases are available in digital format. For EIDs and specific epidemiological scenarios, e TW-CDC ISWG (Taiwan CDC investigation system working group) adopts the available template questions in the ''question bank'' (A1) to generate the template questionnaire (A2), herein, the time interval needed for this process is termed response time for generating template questionnaire (QRT), [ f PSI (personnel-system interface)+SRT]. AEIS contains three system-operated g algorithms to filter and consolidate redundant questions (B1), generate a preliminary questionnaire (B2) and re-order questions into the final version of the questionnaire (C), and integrate data management (B3) and analysis; the time period is termed system response time (SRT), X 5 i~2 S i . The centralized database (E) which integrated clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from NDSS, NIIS, and AEIS, can perform real-time analysis upon request (F). Direction of information flow is indicated with arrows in solid lines; blue indicates system-operated automatic information flow, and black indicates information flow between personnel activity (reporting and data entry) and the system. The personnel response time, h PRT, is from having the final version of the questionnaire to the completion of the epidemic investigation and data entry (D), PRT. Results of the first-tier analysis will be fed back to three stake-holders (shown by dotted blue lines): (1) to Taiwan CDC ISWG for policy decision making, (2) to public health officers for fine-tuning on-site control measures, and (3) The questionnaire was easily accessed from the Taiwan CDC website by the field investigation team using an authorized code; the time required for the personnel activity-related interval from having the questionnaire (case report/confirmation) to the completion of epidemic investigation and data entry is designated as ''Personnel RT'' (PRT) (PRT in Figure 1B Steps C and D). Thus, the overall ''Epidemiologic Investigation RT'' (EIRT) would be PSI+ X 5 i~1 S i +PRT ( Figure 1B : PSI, S1 to S5 and PRT), or QRT+PRT. Since this was the first evaluation of AEIS, only the overall EIRT, along with its elements, was the focus of this report. The centralized database in AEIS ( Figure 1B Step E), contains epidemiological information with integrated clinical and laboratory data from NDSS and NIIS, and has a built-in first tier data analysis algorithm to provide a real-time epidemiological report upon request ( Figure 1B Step F). Results of the first-tier analysis and report can be fed back to the three stake-holders: (1) for a reevaluation process by the Taiwan CDC ISWG advisory board for policy decisions, (2) for fine-tuning on-site control measures by public health officers, and (3) for border quarantine through the Autonomous Health Management System (AHMS). In this first evaluation of AEIS, RT of data analysis was not our focus.",

In AEIS database, parameters pertaining to each individual confirmed cases included gender, birthday, nationality, county of residence, diagnosis, immunization history, occupation, travel history, medical history, history of contacts' and their immunization records, source of report, and symptoms, as well as dates of onset, reporting, case confirmation, final format questionnaire generated, first time epidemiologic investigation and data entry. Dates and methods of control measures, e.g., immunization, environmental disinfection or quarantine, were implemented also available in the database. By analyzing these parameters, all elements of RTs incurred during the flow for each outbreak response could be estimated, which was the primary goal of this study. Temporal trends of EIRTs were also studied by stratified analysis according to routes of transmission and population densities; finally the correlation between RTs and public health outcome were also studied.",

We hypothesized that the implementation of AEIS might shorten the overall EIRT if the proportion of the PRT prior to AEIS which was replaced by PSI and SRT would be sufficiently shortened. Based on this premise, EIRTs were compared for time consumption prior to and after the application of AEIS ( Figure 1A and 1B). Detailed information about the corresponding time frame for EIRT prior to AEIS was scattered in offices of different administrative jurisdictions; therefore, we selected shigellosis for which we could extract EIRT information from the 14 reported clusters of shigellosis outbreaks published in Taiwan Epidemiology Bulletin from 1987 to 2005 [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] . The reference period prior to AEIS was divided into two parts: For the evaluation of PRT, we conducted stratified analysis by modes of transmission [6] and by levels of population density. For the control of each ID, Taiwan CDC has proposed a guideline of time frames within which an epidemic investigation must be initiated. These were based on the routes of transmission, among other epidemic features, and different levels of urgency in responding to a specific ID (Table S1 ). By nature, PRT could vary according to the route of transmission. Thus, we queried whether algorithms in AEIS fitted the need of different categories of IDs. The population density was used as a surrogate for the level of urbanization and development; such a stratified analysis was based on the hypothesis that public health personnel in the remote areas, which were usually with low population density, may be less well trained and have difficulties in receiving continuing professional training and thus might have more difficulties to adapt to a new instrument (increased PSI). The population density of each administrative region (at the level of counties and cities) was grouped into high (3,000 or more people/km 2 ), medium (637 to 2,999 people/km 2 ), and low (636 or less people/km 2 ) for analysis of their PRT.",

The PRT was further evaluated for regions stratified by population density as a proxy for levels of urbanization and socioeconomic development ( Figure 3B ). Regardless of population density, a significant shortening of the PRT was observed over the three years following the implementation of AEIS; the overall mean PRT reduction from 2006 to 2008 was 89.4%, 90.0% and 82.8% for areas of high, medium, and low population densities, respectively (p,0.0001, Kruskall-Wallis test) ( Figure 3B ).

The mean QRTs were 0.6860.01 days (range 0.67 to 0.70 days) for chikungunya and 0.10760.416 days (range 0 to2 days) for H5N1. Both were drastically reduced from the 1142.5 person-hours required during the SARS epidemic.",

Our evaluation indicated that the public health personnel had mastered the new instrumentation of AEIS within 6 months of its implementation. During 2008, the PRT showed a pattern of diminishing drop, suggesting reaching the trough. A preliminary analysis of the mean PRT for 2009 confirmed this notion, a mean PRT of 1.2261.18 days with maximal of 15.76 days and minimal of 0.33 days indicated that it was comparable to that of 2008.

While improved EIRT within the application of AEIS was contingent on the ongoing vigilance of public health personnel in following-up and evaluating the asymptomatic cases for disease prevention and control, it should be acknowledged that AEIS probably produces an information flow system that is conducive for public health officers to remain vigilant.

Our experience indicated that the mean PSI for the two EIDs were 360.57 person-hours each of which is much less than designing a questionnaire from scratch by person. Moreover, for H5N1, the generation of an H5N1 template questionnaire took place when H5N1 cases were happening abroad and was before the first reported suspected case occurred in Taiwan. Thus, for practical purposes, the AEIS provided a mechanism to an enhanced preparedness so that QRT for H5N1 was even shorter than other notifiable IDs. Our research was consistent with that of previous studies that found electronic device-based data collection systems saved labor and time incurred in data handling [21, 22] .",

On the other hand, shigellosis, with no specific and effective preventive measure other than rebuilding personnel hygiene for the infected and healthy ones, the effects of identifying higher proportion of asymptomatic cases were not rewarded by an effective prevention intervention and transmission blockade.

However, a positive health impact might be especially significant in controlling diseases that can be efficiently transmitted via asymptomatically infected individuals [23] , and also diseases with a higher basic reproductive number (R 0 ) [24] , such as influenza, rubella and measles. Thus, one possible explanation was the use of rubella vaccine which is a specific intervention to dampen the cluster size and duration. A shortened PRT would allow earlier intervention of immunizing all contacts who showed no history of immunization (Table S2 ). These findings have prompted a policy of requesting foreign students and workers entering Taiwan for extended periods to receive rubella immunization prior to their entry [25] .",

(5) ''RT for case confirmation'' (CRT) is the time elapsed from the date of onset to the time of case confirmation/exclusion of each EID case by laboratory diagnosis. This is largely dependent on the time required for a diagnostic test and is most pertinent for EIDs with high morbidity and mortality, as control measures include quarantine of contacts.",

PRT included the time needed to conduct field investigation (pure personnel time) and to enter the data (PSI). After the implementation of the AEIS on February 13 th 2006, the weekly mean PRT dropped precipitously from a fluctuating range between 9.8 and 28.8 days in the first four months to a range of less than 10 days in the following months (Figure 2). The decreasing trend continued with a yearly mean PRT of 6.92622.11 days in 2006, 2.1365.77 days in 2007, and 0.8861.52 days in 2008. During 2006, there was no change of AEIS either the programming or computer capacity, and there was no major changes in the human resources among the local public health officials, thus the decreasing trend of PRT might be reasonably attributed to an improved PSI owing to the public health personnel having surpassed the learning period of a new instrument.",
