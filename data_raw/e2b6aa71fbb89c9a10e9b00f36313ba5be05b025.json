Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ , to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5 0 -3 0 cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negativestranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.",

A common characteristic shared by reoviruses as well as many other dsRNA viruses is that their inner capsid contains several copies of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) and mRNA-capping enzymes, and the process of reoviral positive-strand (+) RNA (mRNA) transcription from minus-strand (\u00c0) RNA, followed by mRNA capping, takes place within the reoviral inner capsid (1, 2) . The nascently synthesized and capped (+)RNA is then released into the cytoplasm of infected cells for protein translation. After that, reoviral (+)RNAs are encapsidated into newly assembled inner capsids, and are used by RdRPs as templates to synthesize genomic dsRNA segments within reoviral inner capsids (1, 3, 4) . Thus, unlike most single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, reoviruses use their inner capsids as the machinery for viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis and the shield for evading host antiviral defenses (1, 2, 4) .",

VP1 is the shell protein that forms the CPV capsid shell; VP3 is the mRNA-capping enzyme; and VP5 serves as the clamp protein to enhance the stability of the CPV capsid shell (10, 12) . In addition, one cypoviral RdRP, VP2, is located at the inner surface of the CPV capsid shell at each 5-fold axis (3, 7) . Moreover, Cheng and colleagues recently found that during cypoviral mRNA transcription, both VP1 and VP3 undergo conformational changes, resulting in an enlarged capsid chamber and a wider channel in the capsid for mRNA transport and capping (8) . For VP5, no structural change has been detected (8) , and it was not known whether VP5 contains any activity other than stabilizing capsid shell.",

Moreover, the interactions (also termed 'cyclization') between the 5 0 -and 3 0 -termini of vRNAs have been recognized as an important prelude for efficient vRNA replication of many (+)RNA viruses like flaviviruses, (\u00c0)RNA viruses like hantaviruses and dsRNA viruses like reoviruses (16) (17) (18) . For reoviruses, the 5 0 -3 0 cyclization of reoviral (+)RNA forms a panhandle-like structure (19, 20) . This 5 0 -3 0 panhandle is required for efficient dsRNA replication, probably by allowing reoviral RdRP to recognize the 3 0 -terminal of the (+)RNA template to initiate (\u00c0)RNA synthesis (18) . On the other hand, like other 5 0 -3 0 cyclized vRNAs (21) , the panhandle should be disrupted when RNA replication proceeds on the cyclized template (18) .",

However, correct folding or unfolding of RNAs is always challenging, since it is believed that RNAs would be easily trapped in local intermediate structures that are thermodynamically stable (15, 22) . In response, cells or viruses encode various RNA remodeling proteins, generally including adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicases and ATPindependent RNA chaperones, which are proposed to help overcome the thermodynamic barriers of kinetically trapped RNA molecules. RNA helicases are thought to be involved in most ATP-dependent structural rearrangements of RNAs (23) . On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that are able to destabilize or unwind RNA helices and accelerate the formation of correctly folded RNA structures by helping misfolded RNAs escape kinetic traps. For the viruses having vRNA cyclization, both hantavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein and flavivirus core (capsid) protein are RNA chaperones, and hantavirus N has also been reported to unwind the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle structure in vitro (21) . However, no capsid protein of CPVs or other reoviruses has been found to be an RNA chaperone.",

Thus far, the RNA genome of HaCPV-5 has been completely sequenced (24, 25) . HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8 contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 44-kDa protein, and further sequence and structural analysis using bioinformatic tools has revealed that this 44-kDa protein is the VP5 capsid protein (11, 12, 26) . In this study, we expressed HaCPV-5 VP5 in a eukaryotic expression system and determined that this CPV VP5 possesses an RNA chaperone-like activity to ATP-independently destabilize RNA helices and accelerate strand annealing. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent metallic ions, such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ , to various degrees. Moreover, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 could facilitate the transcription initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a CPV panhandle-structured RNA template, thereby strongly suggesting a direct role of the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 in the initiation of cypoviral dsRNA replication.",

Because many capsid proteins of RNA viruses have RNA binding activity (21, 34, 35) , we sought to determine whether VP5 could also bind to RNA. To this end, a gel mobility shift assay with a HEX-labeled 24-nt ssRNA (RNA1) was conducted. MBP-VP5 did bind to RNA1 (Figure 2A, lane 3) , showing that VP5 has ssRNA binding activity. Moreover, to determine whether VP5 also has dsRNA binding activity, we constructed the RNA helix by annealing HEX-labeled RNA1 with a nonlabeled RNA (RNA2) that is complementary to RNA1 and found that VP5 efficiently shifted the RNA helix ( Figure 2A , lane 6). After determining that MBP-VP5 can bind to both ssRNA and dsRNA, it is intriguing for us to examine whether this protein has a higher affinity for ssRNA or for dsRNA. To this end, RNA probe competition assays were performed. Briefly, 0.1 pmol HEX-labeled ssRNA probe and 2 pmol MBP-VP5 were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ssRNA (RNA10) or dsRNA (RNA10/RNA2). As shown in Figure 2B , only the ssRNA competitor efficiently competed with HEXlabeled RNA1, while dsRNA had a minimal competing effect, indicating that MBP-VP5 has a higher affinity for ssRNA.",

The RNA binding data were then quantified, and a Hill transformation was applied to determine whether the binding of MBP-VP5 to ssRNA is cooperative [a >1 Hill coefficient indicates positive cooperativity (36, 37) ]. As shown in Figure 2D , MBP-VP5 at low concentrations (0.05-0.16 mM) had a Hill coefficient value of $1.499, whereas high protein concentrations (0.2-0.48 mM) had a higher Hill coefficient value of $4.972. These results indicate that VP5 binds to ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Taken together, these results show that HaCPV-5 VP5 has both ssRNA and dsRNA binding capacity, has higher affinity for ssRNA and binds ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Besides, we also examined if MBP-VP5 can bind to DNA, and our results showed that this protein also has ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities (Supplementary Figure S1) .",

Thus, we sought to determine whether the presence of ATP has any effect on the unwinding activity of VP5. For this purpose, the standard RNA helix substrate with both 3 0 and 5 0 tails ( Figure 8A ) was incubated with MBP-VP5 in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.25-10 mM) of ATP for 10 min ( Figure 8B ) or 60 min ( Figure 8C ). In either condition, the presence of ATP had no positive effect on the unwinding activity of VP5 ( Figure 8B and C); in contrast, higher ATP concentrations (>0.25 mM) actually inhibited RNA helix destabilization in a dose-response manner ( Figure 8B , lanes 3-8; 8C, lanes 4-9). These experiments were independently repeated several times, and the gradual inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of ATP was plotted ( Figure 8B and C, right panels).",

Equal amounts (0.1 pmol) of these two strands were incubated for 15 min in the presence of MBP alone or MBP-VP5. Gel electrophoresis was conducted to detect the annealing of the two complementary RNA strands. The annealing of the RNA strands in the presence of MBP alone was almost undetectable ( Figure 10B, lane 3) , whereas the presence of 5 pmol MBP-VP5 dramatically stimulated strand annealing ( Figure 10B, lane 4) . Moreover, nucleic acid chaperone normally functions well when its amount is in large excess over that of its substrate (21) . To determine whether this notion also applies to VP5, we incubated increasing amounts (5-40 pmol) of MBP-VP5 with the two RNA strands (0.1 pmol each). As shown in Figure 10B (lanes 4-8) , increasing the amount of MBP-VP5 led to stronger stimulating effects on strand annealing in a dose-response manner. Taken together, our data show that HaCPV-5 VP5 contains RNA chaperone-like activity that can destabilize RNA helices and stimulate RNA strand annealing. concentrations. Our results showed that the destabilizing activity was optimal at 0 mM for Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ( Figure 11B and C) , and the increase of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ concentrations from 0 to 20 mM led to a gradual decrease in the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5. Interestingly, this observation also excludes the possibility that the inhibitory effect of higher ATP concentrations (>0.25 mM) on VP5-mediated helix destabilization (Figure 8 ) was due to the chelation of Mg 2+ , which could be caused by adding large quantities of ATP or other NTPs (32, 41) , since lower Mg 2+ concentrations actually enhance helix destabilization. For Ca 2+ , the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5 was optimal at 1.25 mM, and the increase of Ca 2+ concentrations from 1.25 to 20 mM also led to a gradual decrease in the RNA helix destabilization ( Figure 11D ). Our results showed that the inhibitory effect of Zn 2+ on helix destabilization was more dramatic than that of the other three divalent ions, and the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5 was almost abolished when the concentration of Zn 2+ reached 5 mM ( Figure 11E) . Moreover, all these divalent metallic ions conferred inhibitory effects in a doseresponse manner.",

Since the destabilization of the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle structure of CPV (+)RNA should occur before or when the (\u00c0)RNA synthesis proceeds on the cyclized (+)RNA template (18) , it is plausible that VP5 functions to unwind the reoviral 5 0 -3 0 panhandle to allow replication initiation at the accessible 3 0 -end by an RdRP. To assess this possibility, we adapted a canonical assay, which was developed by Panganiban and colleagues for assessing the ability of hantavirus N protein to facilitate RNA replication initiation through the hantaviral panhandle structure (21), for VP5. We used this assay to determine whether VP5 can enhance in vitro primer-dependent replication initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through the cypoviral panhandle structure. To this end, a structured RNA mimicking the cypoviral panhandle structure was constructed using 36 nt from the 5 0 -end and 30 nt from the 3 0 -end of HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8, and then used as the template for RT ( Figure 12A , upper panel). Moreover, because RT reactions normally involve thermal cycles at 68 C to denature and anneal the RNA template with a primer, the RT reactions were carried out at 25 C in the presence or absence of MBP-VP5 to assess the potential role of the VP5's RNA chaperone activity to unwind panhandle structure of the RNA template. Here, DIG-labeled dUTP was supplemented into the reaction mixture for visualizing the RT products. As shown in Figure 12B , the presence of VP5 dramatically stimulated the synthesis of RT products (lane 2), as did the thermal annealing treatment at 68 C (lane 1); on the other hand, the reaction product was barely detectable in the absence of VP5 ( Figure 12B, lanes 3 and 4) .",

Moreover, the structural homologs of CPV VP5 are commonly present in the inner capsids of other turreted reoviruses, including orthoreovirus s2 and aquareovirus VP6, which also function as molecular clamps to stabilize inner capsids (12, 33, 42) .

As observed with CPV VP5, the helixdestabilizing activity of rotavirus NSP2 has no nucleotide sequence specificity and lacks unwinding directionality. It is generally believed that the helix-destabilizing activity of RNA chaperones normally requires a large excess of protein over RNA helix substrates (32, 39) , and this notion also applies to both CPV VP5 and rotavirus NSP2. The optimal unwinding activity of VP5 was observed at the protein-to-nucleic acid molar ratio of $100:1-200:1, whereas the optimal activity of rotavirus NSP2 was detected at much higher molar ratios of $1000:1-2000:1 (45) .",

For instance, VP5 binds to both RNA and DNA and exhibits RNA-specific destabilizing activity (Figure 4) , whereas NSP2 is an ssRNA binding protein and can unwind both RNA-RNA and DNA-RNA helix substrates (45, 46) . The difference between VP5 and NSP2 implies that these two proteins may not use the same mechanism to destabilize RNA helices. Moreover, because no previous study has determined whether rotavirus NSP2 possesses strand annealing acceleration activity, an important characteristic of RNA chaperones, further characterization of NSP2 is needed to determine whether this protein can be recognized as an RNA or nucleic acid chaperone. Both CPV VP5 and rotavirus NSP2 are components of reoviral RNA replication machinery: the former is a major CPV capsid protein, and the latter is associated with the rotaviral RdRP (12, 47) . There is no homology between rotavirus NSP2 and any CPV structural or nonstructural proteins; on the other hand, CPV VP5 has no sequence similarity with any rotavirus proteins. Moreover, as a 'nonturreted' reovirus, rotavirus does not encode clamp proteins (48) . These observations led us to question whether CPV or rotavirus contains extra RNA chaperone or helix-destabilizing protein, except VP5 or NSP2, respectively. However, since it is not uncommon for a virus (e.g. HIV-1) to encode multiple RNA chaperones, the possibility that a reovirus contains more than one RNA chaperones cannot be ruled out, and it would be interesting for us or others to investigate this issue in the future.",

As seen with (\u00c0)-vRNA of hantavirus, reoviral (+)-vRNA can be cyclized, and its 5 0 -and 3 0 -ends undergo base pairing to form a panhandle-like structure (49) . Previous studies revealed that the panhandle structure of cyclized reoviral (+)-vRNA is required for efficient dsRNA synthesis probably by recruiting RdRPs to the 3 0 -end of the (+)-vRNA template (18) . Moreover, like other 5 0 -3 0 cyclized vRNAs, before or when RNA replication initiates, the vRNA panhandle structure should be dissociated to make the 3 0 -end of the template accessible by RdRPs (18) . Considering that hantavirus N, a nucleocapsid protein and RNA chaperone, can efficiently unwind the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle of cyclized hantaviral (\u00c0)-vRNA and subsequently promote transcription/replication initiation (21, 50) , we propose that the RNA chaperone activity of CPV VP5 is directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication by destabilizing cypoviral panhandle structure in a similar manner. In accordance with this speculation, we found that when an RNA structure mimicking the cypoviral panhandle was used as a template, HaCPV-5 VP5 effectively promoted primerdependent transcription initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) ( Figure 12) .",

To explain the RNA chaperone activities, an 'entropy transfer' model has been proposed. According to this model, RNA chaperones contain intrinsically disordered (unstructured), highly flexible regions that can transfer their disorder or entropy to misfolded RNA molecules on binding to RNA. Such an entropy transfer can destabilize kinetically trapped misfolded RNA molecules, leading to the rearrangement of RNA folding in an ATP-independent manner (13, 14) . So far, many virus-encoded RNA chaperones, including HIV-1 NC, Vif and Tat, hantavirus N, flavivirus core, coronavirus N and tombusvirus p33, have been predicted to contain intrinsically disordered regions (14, 51) . However, since the regions responsible for chaperoning activities have not been accurately mapped in many RNA chaperones, the relationship between intrinsic disorder and RNA chaperone activities is difficult to formally determine (43, 52) . Furthermore, alternative models, such as transient ionic or electrostatic interactions, have also been proposed to explain the RNA chaperone activity (22) . Our disorder prediction of CPV VP5 using PONDR VL-XT (51, 53, 54) indicates that VP5 proteins from three different types of cypoviruses-CPV-5, CPV-1 and CPV-18-contain similar distribution patterns of potentially disordered regions (data not shown), thereby suggesting that the 'entropy transfer' applies to HaCPV-5 VP5, and VP5 proteins of other CPVs may also contain RNA chaperone activity.",

            "text": "As a single-shelled member of the family Reoviridae, CPV is well recognized as an ideal and simplified model for studying the mechanisms of vRNA replication and mRNA capping of the Reoviridae and probably other dsRNA Viridae. In this study, we found that a CPV capsid clamp protein VP5 possesses a novel RNA chaperone activity, which is thought to be directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication. These findings show that CPV capsid proteins not only include RNA polymerase and mRNA capping enzyme, but also RNA chaperone that is important for vRNA replication and/or translation. This study should extend our understanding of RNA replication of CPV, Reoviridae and dsRNA Viridae, and also enrich our knowledge about virus-encoded RNA chaperones. Furthermore, since the (+)-vRNA cyclization and panhandle structures commonly exist in the family Reoviridae, encoding an RNA chaperone or other RNA remodeling protein, like helicase, might be a common strategy for all reoviruses. Future studies by our group and others should reveal whether rotavirus NSP2, the clamp proteins of other turreted reoviruses, as well as other reoviral structural or nonstructural proteins can also function in 5 0 -3 0 panhandle unwinding and RNA replication initiation.",

Characterization of the optimal biochemical reaction conditions for the RNA helix-destabilizing activity of VP5 To further characterize the biochemical properties of VP5, we evaluated its RNA helix-destabilizing activity under various conditions with different divalent metallic ions, ion concentrations and pH values. First, we assessed the requirement of divalent metallic ions, including Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ , on the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5. In this experiment, 0.1 pmol standard RNA duplex substrate with both 5 0 and 3 0 tails (Figure 11A, upper panel) was incubated with 10 pmol MBP-VP5 in the presence of 2.5 mM Mg 2+ Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ for 60 min. The presence of 2.5 mM Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ did not effect helix destabilization (Figure 11A [lower panel], lane 2 versus lane 3 or 5); on the other hand, the presence of 2.5 mM Mn 2+ slightly inhibited the helixdestabilizing activity of VP5 (lane 4), and the inhibitory effect of Zn 2+ was more dramatic (lane 6).Next, we assessed the impact of Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ concentrations on the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5. Of note, because the RNA duplex substrate was completely unwound by VP5 in the presence of Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ when incubated for 60 min, a shorter incubation time (30 min) was used in the subsequent experiments to measure the effects of varying ion",
