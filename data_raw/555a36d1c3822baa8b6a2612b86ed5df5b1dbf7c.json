            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic betacoronavirus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe acute respiratory disease. As of July 28, 2017, there have been 2,040 confirmed cases with 712 reported deaths. While many infections have been fatal, there have also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing. New Zealand white rabbits are a possible model for asymptomatic infection with MERS-CoV. In order to discover more about non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with MERS-CoV would protect against reinfection, we inoculated rabbits with MERS-CoV and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response. Following intranasal infection, rabbits developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral RNA, viral antigen, and perivascular inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs. The rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the animals were not protected from reinfection. In fact, reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without an associated increase in viral RNA titers. Interestingly, passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to na\u00efve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection. We further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection. However, reinfection elicited neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge. Our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to MERS-CoV who fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response, or persons whose neutralizing antibody titers have waned, may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure to MERS-CoV.",

Like other human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), MERS-CoV is associated with respiratory tract infection. However, unlike most other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV has a zoonotic origin and can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome. These characteristics are reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a large outbreak of human infections in 2003 [2] .",

The dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protein, which is the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV in these animals differed from human DPP4 at key residues, and therefore did not bind to the MERS-CoV spike protein [18] . Several modified mouse models have been generated to overcome this receptor-mediated restriction including both transduced and transgenic animals expressing human DPP4, and lethal infection models have been established [19] [20] [21] . Nonhuman primates have been successfully infected, with rhesus macaques displaying a mild, transient illness and marmosets demonstrating a more severe and sometimes lethal infection [22] [23] [24] [25] , although there is some discrepancy in findings from marmosets [26] . Camels and alpacas have also been experimentally infected and exhibit transient viral replication in the upper respiratory tract [27, 28] . However, the expense and care of camels and the ethical concerns surrounding the use of non-human primates limits their widespread utility for research studies.",

These severely inflamed regions were characterized by an abundance of eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells which formed densely cellular collars of inflammatory cells around the affected perivascular and peribronchiolar regions. In addition, the cellular infiltrate expanded and obscured much of the adjacent alveolar interstitium. The alveolar interstitium also contained regions of proteinaceous fluid and diffuse type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig 4B inset) . This inflammatory response was driven by reinfection, and was not residual inflammation from the primary infection. This was confirmed by including a group of previously infected rabbits that received diluent alone in the reinfection study ( Fig 4D, and S1 Table) . The rabbits in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group had antigen levels comparable to primary infection, while the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group had lower levels of antigen by IHC (Fig 4E and 4F , S1 and S2 Tables). These data indicate that low titers of non-neutralizing antibodies do not protect rabbits from reinfection, and may instead result in enhanced inflammation. The S protein-specific IgG ELISA antibody titers were boosted following secondary infection and remained detectable for five weeks, with a GMT of 6451 for the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group, and a GMT of 4064 for the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group (Table 1) . N protein-specific antibodies were found in all rabbits in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group and one of the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group. Secondary infections in both groups resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies, although the titer in one rabbit in the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group dropped below the detection limit by five weeks post-infection (Table 1 ). Overall the 10 3// 10 5 TCID 50 group had lower neutralizing titers than the 10 5// 10 5 TCID 50 group, with GMTs of 27 and 73 respectively.",

Viral antigen levels appeared similar between all groups by IHC (Fig 6E, 6F and 6G, S1 and S2 Tables). Enhanced inflammation after MERS reinfection in rabbits Increased complement activation is associated with enhanced inflammation Non-neutralizing antibodies typically enhance inflammation and pathology during an immune response through interactions with Fc or complement receptors [32] . We first examined the possibility that the antibodies were causing enhanced inflammation due to an increase in viral uptake and replication in macrophages through interaction with their native cellular receptor or an Fc receptor, as happens in dengue [32] [33] [34] . Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) during infection has also been observed with other coronaviruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [35] . However, it was not clear that such a mechanism was likely since the enhanced inflammation in secondary MERS-CoV infection in rabbits was not associated with an increased viral load by either qRT-PCR or IHC (Fig 4A, S1 and S2 Tables).",

In addition, the volume of the inoculum was not stated by Haagmans et al, although a recent publication indicates a volume up to 3ml may have been delivered intratracheally [38] .

However, the serum IgG antibody lacked neutralizing activity and contributed to the enhanced pulmonary inflammation observed upon reinfection. Passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to na\u00efve animals followed by MERS-CoV challenge recreated the same histopathological depiction, though there was an increase in vascular congestion following passive transfer that was not observed in the previously infected rabbits. This is likely a consequence of transferring complete serum containing additional serum proteins, including those involved in the complement cascade into na\u00efve rabbits instead of transferring purified MERS-CoV specific IgG antibodies.

The enhanced inflammation observed in the rabbits after MERS-CoV reinfection appears to be mediated through interactions between nonneutralizing antibodies and complement proteins, resulting in activation of the complement cascade and formation of immune complexes. The increase of C3a and C9 proteins in the rabbit lungs following reinfection supports this possibility. Immune complexes have been implicated in the pathogenesis in other viral infections, including influenza and RSV [46, 47] . While C9 and the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs) are typically involved in response to bacterial pathogens, enveloped viruses are also susceptible to lysis by MACs [48, 49] . Complement activation can also be responsible for an increase in the release of anaphylotoxins and more recruitment and activation of immune cells, leading to inflammation. The presence of CD3+ T cells in the same regions of the lung as MERS-CoV N antigen during reinfection is consistent with this scenario (Fig 9) .",

There are some data to suggest that MERS-CoV vaccine approaches may also result in immunopathology; as eosinophilic infiltration with enhanced lung pathology was observed in vaccinated transgenic mice following MERS-CoV challenge [59] . Since the mice had neutralizing antibodies before challenge, and had significant reduction in viral titers following challenge compared to control mice, we believe the mechanisms behind these two phenomena are distinct, but still require consideration. These discrepant observations highlight the critical need for additional clinical data, and continued attention during the development and testing of coronavirus vaccines.",
