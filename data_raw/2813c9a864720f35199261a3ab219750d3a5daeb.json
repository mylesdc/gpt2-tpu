            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) poses a great threat to the global swine industries and the unreliable protection induced by the currently available vaccines remains a major challenge. We previously generated a genogroup 2b (G2b) PEDV Taiwan Pintung 52 (PEDVPT) strain, PEDVPT-P96, and determined its promising host immune response against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 strain. To study the attenuation determinants of PEDVPT-P96 and establish a PEDVPT-P96-based recombinant vector as a vaccine platform for further antigenicity modification, iPEDVPT-P96, a full-length cDNA clone of PEDVPT-P96, was established. Comparing to the parental PEDVPT-P96 virus, the iPEDVPT-P96 virus showed efficient replication kinetics with a delayed decline of viral load and similar but much more uniform plaque sizes in Vero cells. In the 5-week-old piglet model, fecal viral shedding was observed in the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated piglets, whereas those inoculated with iPEDVPT-P96 showed neither detectable fecal viral shedding nor PEDV-associated clinical signs. Moreover, inoculation with iPEDVPT-P96 elicited comparable levels of anti-PEDV specific plasma IgG and fecal/salivary IgA, neutralizing antibody titers, and similar but less effective immunoprotection against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge compared to the parental PEDVPT-P96. In the present study, an infectious cDNA clone of an attenuated G2b PEDV strain was successfully generated for the first time, and the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that iPEDVPT-P96 is further attenuated but remains immunogenic compared to its parental PEDVPT-P96 viral stock. The successful development of the iPEDVPT-P96 cDNA clone could allow for the manipulation of the viral genome to study viral pathogenesis and facilitate the rapid development of effective vaccines.",

In late 2010, new and highly virulent PEDV strains arose in China and spread rapidly worldwide by late 2013, resulting in nearly 100% mortality in the affected nursing piglets [3] [4] [5] . To date, there are still indelible endemics and considerable economic losses in the global swine market [6] . Besides, the protection conferred by currently available vaccines is, unfortunately, unsatisfactory [6, 7] . Based on the nucleotide identity of the S gene, PEDVs are categorized into four genogroups (Gs), namely G1a, G1b, G2a, and G2b [8] . Among these, the G2b PEDV strains that predominate the field in Asia and North America, show higher pathogenicity [9] and appear to elicit broader protection across different genogroups [10] [11] [12] . Although the increased virulence of new PEDV strains was ascribed to several mutations in the S gene through viral escape from antibody neutralization induced by traditional vaccines [13, 14] , the detailed mechanism remains elusive.",

Despite the high potential of PEDVPT-P96 as a future vaccine candidate against PEDV as indicated by its reduced pathogenicity and robust host immune response in our 5-week-old piglet model [15] , the difficulty in PEDV isolation and subsequent lengthy passage process rendered the PEDVPT-P96 unable to promptly respond to the vast outbreak in late 2013. This year, Zhou et al. [16] reported a new disastrous swine disease outbreak in China in 2016 caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin, again highlighting the potential burden of the interspecies jumping of coronavirus, and a pressing need for a readily applicable vaccine platform for new emergences. The reverse genetics system has been widely used to study viral pathogenesis and novel vaccine design. At present, the reported PEDV infectious cDNA clones were exclusively constructed based on sequences of the representative wild-type PEDV isolates [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Consequently, they are highly pathogenic and fatal in suckling piglets, comparable to their parental viruses. With regard to vaccine use, further genetic editing is necessary to attenuate these recombinant viruses. Alternatively, a complementary approach exploiting the attenuated phenotype to address the safety concerns has not been described. In the present study, a full-length cDNA clone of the attenuated PEDVPT-P96, iPEDVPT-P96, was generated. In addition, the pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and protection against virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge by iPEDVPT-P96 were evaluated in the 5-week-old piglet model. Our data suggest that the iPEDVPT-P96 virus was more attenuated but able to elicit similar immunogenicity and immunoprotection against the autologous virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge compared to the parental PEDVPT-P96 virus. This iPEDVPT-P96 cDNA clone is expected to allow for the manipulation of the viral genome to study viral pathogenesis. On the other hand, it can serve as a vaccine platform, for example, by directly replacing the S gene with that of the (re)emerging swine coronaviruses.",

Briefly, the complete genome of PEDVPT-P96 (Genbank accession No. KY929406) was divided into six fragments by PCR amplification using primer pairs (Table 1 ) incorporated with specific type-IIS restriction enzyme sites for seamless ligation. Fragment A contained a T7 promoter sequence at its 5 end to allow in vitro transcription and the sequence was designed following the article published previously [19] ; a 25-adenosine sequence was added to the 3 end of fragment F to simulate polyadenylation. A naturally occurring BsaI site in fragment E was removed by introducing a silent mutation (C24341T) by site-directed mutagenesis according to the previously described protocol [23] . An additional synonymous mutation (T24841C) was generated near the junction of fragments E and F, to create a novel BsmBI recognition site. PCR amplicons of all fragments were subcloned into plasmid vectors (pJET1.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Each subclone was digested with the corresponding type-IIS restriction enzymes as indicated in Figure 1 and gel-purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Assembly of the full-length cDNA was conducted by employing T4 ligase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) overnight at 4 \u2022 C. The ligated full-length cDNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and in vitro transcribed to full-length RNA transcripts using a mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cap analog to GTP ratio was adjusted to 1:1 to increase the yield of full-length transcripts. To facilitate viral recovery, nucleocapsid (N) transcripts were also generated from amplicons flanking the entire N gene with the addition of the T7 promoter sequence and poly-A tail at the 3 and 5 ends, respectively. The N transcripts were precipitated using lithium chloride (Ambion, Austin, CA, USA) and purified with ethanol. ",

As to the replicative capacity, the multistep growth kinetics of both the iPEDVPT-P96 and PEDVPT-P96 viruses in Vero cells were examined. At MOI of 0.1, while PEDVPT-P96 replicated rapidly to the titer of 4.58 \u00b1 0.14 TCID 50 /mL at 12 HPI, reached the peak viral titer of 6.42 \u00b1 0.29 TCID 50 /mL at 24 HPI, and showed a declined viral titer of 5.58 \u00b1 0.38 TCID 50 /mL at 36 HPI. iPEDVPT-P96 showed a steady increase in viral progenies and a significantly decreased viral titer of 3.58 \u00b1 0.14 TCID 50 /mL at 12 HPI, a comparable viral titer of 6.16 \u00b1 0.38 TCID 50 /mL at 24 HPI, and a significantly high viral titer of 7.16 \u00b1 0.38 TCID 50 /mL at 36 HPI ( Figure 2D ). At MOIs of 0.001 and 0.00001, similar to those observed at 0.01 MOI, iPEDVPT-P96 replicated slower in the beginning, reached a similar peak viral titer as compared to PEDVPT-P96 and showed a relatively slower reduction of viral titer after reaching the peak titer (see Figure S1 ).",

Moreover, neither fecal PEDV RNA shedding nor a PEDV-associated clinical illness was detected in conventional 5-week-old piglets inoculated with the iPEDVPT-P96 virus, indicating a further attenuated phenotype in vivo. Importantly, piglets in the iPEDVPT-P96-inoculated group showed comparable levels of anti-PEDV specific plasma IgG, fecal/salivary IgA, plasma neutralizing antibody titers, and a weakened but modest immunoprotection against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge compared to the parental PEDVPT-P96-inoculated piglets.

            "text": "While inoculation with iPEDVPT-P96 was demonstrated to completely protect the piglets from developing diarrhea after challenge with the virulent PEDVPT-P5, the iPEDVPT-P96-inoculated group showed an earlier onset and longer duration of fecal PEDV RNA shedding with a higher peak value than that of the parental PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group. These data suggested that iPEDVPT-P96 conferred a relatively weakened protection than that of the parental PEDVPT-P96. Considering that the major variation between the PEDVPT-P96 and iPEDVPT-P96 viruses should be the heterogeneity of viral population as noted in plaque assays wherein the iPEDVPT-P96 virus produced more uniform plaques than those of the parental PEDVPT-P96 virus in Vero cells, we speculate that the decrease in quasispecies diversity in iPEDVPT-P96 may partly contribute to its further attenuation in vivo. To investigate the speculation, we conducted the next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the quasispecies diversity of both viruses by exploring the recovered variants against our previous published sequence of PEDVPT-P96 generated by Sanger sequence (see Table S1 ). The results clearly demonstrated that the PEDVPT-P96 carried a greater sequence diversity than that of the iPEDVPT-P96, including 23 single nucleotide variants (SNV) and resultant 16 amino acid substitutions; of interest, seven SNV were found in the spike gene and 3 of them were the same as the virulent PEDVPT-P5. For iPEDVPT-P96, excluding the artificially introduced marker mutations and those derived from the SNV of PEDVPT-P96 upon the initial construction of subclones of iPEDVPT-P96, only 3 SNV were uncovered. Indeed, generating viruses with high-fidelity replication has been proposed as a rational strategy to develop genetically stable and safe attenuated vaccines [25, 26] . However, for attenuated viruses, the in vivo fitness and antigenicity are already abated after serial cell culture passage. On the basis of quasispecies theory that the cooperative interplay between different variants determines viral characteristics including virulence [27, 28] , it is possible that the consensus sequence used for constructing iPEDVPT-P96 no longer sustained the original affinity of virus-host interaction or viral replication in enterocytes, which therefore impaired viral entry and/or limited the viral infection. Furthermore, the limited diversity of the S gene in the iPEDVPT-P96 viral stock might also diminish the potency and protective broadness of the induced antibody responses explaining the comparable level of systemic and mucosal antibody response but weakened protection in the iPEDVPT-P96-inoculated group. This speculation could be tested by comparing the tissue tropism and the quantity of PEDV antigens of both PEDVPT-P96 and iPEDVPT-P96 in enterocytes using a 7-day-old piglet model. Other explanation for the attenuation of iPEDVPT-P96 might be attributed to the possible addition of the five nucleotides \"GGAGA\" at the very extreme of the 5 UTR based on our primer design (see Table 1 ). Considering the location that these additional nucleotides sequence should neither alter the secondary structures of the SL1 stem-loop, that serve as cis-acting elements required for driving subgenomic RNA synthesis nor change any consensus transcription regulatory sequences 5 -XUA(A/G)AC-3 , we assumed that the effect of these additional nucleotides in the rescued iPEDVPT-P96 virus on replication might be minimal. Nonetheless, further studies are required to determine the potential effect of these five additional nucleotides on iPEDVPT-P96 replication.",

That is, it seemed that the conventional piglets used in the current study were more resistant to the PEDVPT-P96 infection. Several host factors such as genetic variation, type of feed, gut microflora, and immune status among different litters at the time of inoculation may play an important role in the varying severity of clinical outcomes and immune responses [9] . Ideally, the discrepancy between the previous experiment might be minimized by expanding the size of groups, particularly if we chose conventional piglets as our target animals. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty in collecting large numbers of PEDV-negative piglets in Taiwan where PED has become endemic, we decided to use five piglets per treatment to reach a statistical effect practice. Although the use of conventional pigs often magnifies those variables and results in higher variation in the experimental results, to mimic the pathogenicity and immunoprotection of PEDV in field conditions, the conventional pig model is still a preferred as a preclinical trial model.",

            "text": "Since the sudden appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the early 21st century, the emergence and re-emergence of coronaviruses continually threatens the global public and animal health by causing severe illnesses, by having a high potential of zoonosis, and by causing great economic losses, indicating a desperate need for an effective and readily responsive vaccine platform. The large genome size of coronaviruses warrants a great tolerance for foreign genes and subsequent expression of heterologous antigens [29, 30] . In addition, the insertion of other antigens by replacing the accessory ORF3 gene or creating a novel expression cassette is also an attractive approach to design multivalent vaccines [17, 18, 21] . Under this concept, iPEDVPT-P96 could be a potential safe vaccine backbone that facilitates the prompt generation of chimeric vaccines with the induction of mucosal immunity. For instance, viral antigenicity can be manipulated by replacing the iPEDVPT-P96 S gene with that of other PEDV or emerging swine coronaviruses although the potential loss of attenuation due to the S substitution requires further clarification. However, it is noteworthy that the inherent genetic instability of coronaviruses due to high recombination and mutation frequency is also a matter of concern as it raises the possibility of virulence reversion and acquisition of new tropism [31] . Besides, the intrinsic characteristics of the gene of interest, the targeted locus within the coronavirus genome, may also affect the expression level and stability of the recombinant viruses [30] . Accordingly, further characterization of the virulence variation and genetic stability of iPEDVPT-P96 after different genetic modifications needs to be conducted.",

We also proposed that the initial low quasispecies diversity and the additional 5 nucleotides at the 5 end of iPEDVPT-P96 may contribute to a further attenuated phenotype and potentially less effective immunoprotection against the virulent strain challenge. Based on the results of antibody response, a prime-boost strategy or further optimization of iPEDVPT-P96 antigenicity is essential to induce sufficient protective immunity in all recipients. Together, the full-length cDNA clone of iPEDVPT-P96 generated herein is expected to provide an access to study the attenuation determinants of PEDVPT-P96 and establish a PEDVPT-P96-based recombinant vector as a vaccine platform for developing multivalent vaccines for PEDV and other porcine pathogens.

The titers of each virus at the indicated time points (hours post-infection; HPI) were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Different alphabetic letters indicated significant differences between the iPEDVPT-P96 or PEDVPT-P96 groups (p < 0.05).",
