            "text": "Ebolaviruses continue to inflict horrific disease and instill fear. The 2013-2016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from~130 to~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GP cl ) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GP cl is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GP cl . Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GP cl -mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GP cl binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factors-cations (Ca ++ and K + ), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero) Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and L-did not induce detectable fusion. Our findings are in line with the earlier proposal that an additional factor is required to trigger the full fusion activity of GP cl after binding to NPC1. We discuss caveats to our study and what the missing factor(s) might be.",

            "text": "EBOV enters host cells by binding to attachment factors such as lectins and TIM/TAM family members through interactions, respectively, with the viral glycoprotein (GP) and phospholipids in the viral envelope [3] . GP is a class I fusion protein present at the surface of the virion as a trimer of heterodimers, each comprised of two subunits linked by a disulfide bond: the highly glycosylated receptor-binding subunit (GP1) and the fusion subunit (GP2). After internalization through a macropinocytotic pathway [3, 4] , GP1 is cleaved at low pH by endosomal cysteine-proteases, namely cathepsins B and L, removing the mucin domain and glycan cap and producing a cleaved form of GP1 (~19 kDa) [5] [6] [7] . Then GP1 binds to its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a cholesterol transporter located in late endosomes/lysosomes [8-10]. The utilization of intracellular viral receptors is a fairly new concept in virology, with all known filoviruses employing NPC1 and the arenavirus, Lassa virus (LASV), using Lamp1 [2, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . While Lamp1 is thought to raise the pH-threshold for fusion [13, 14] , the exact role of NPC1 in EBOV entry is yet to be determined. It is postulated that after binding to NPC1, cathepsin-cleaved GP (GP cl ) undergoes further conformational changes empowering GP2 to mediate fusion [16] .",

            "text": "The factors needed to trigger the fusion activity of GP cl remain under debate. Early work showed that host cell entry mediated by GP cl remains sensitive to lysosomotropic agents and the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d [6] . These findings suggested that GP cl requires low pH and an additional activity inhibited by E64d, perhaps additional cathepsin cleavage, to trigger its fusion ability. Additional cell biological [17] [18] [19] [20] and biochemical studies [21-24] supported this concept. Furthermore, findings stated in [10] suggested that low pH and engagement of the C-loop of NPC1, the binding domain for GP cl within NPC1, are not sufficient to trigger fusion. The endosomal two pore calcium channel 2 (TPC2) was subsequently identified as a late entry factor for EBOV [25] , but its exact role in fusion is not known. In contrast to the literature cited above suggesting needs for low pH, NPC1, and an additional factor(s) to support GP cl -mediated fusion, Markosyan et al. [26] proposed that binding to NPC1 is sufficient to induce GP cl to induce fusion, even at neutral pH.",

The assays employed included highly sensitive luciferase-based cell-cell and pseudoviruscell fusion assays, as well as a flow cytometric-based assay for cell-cell hemifusion. Our findings suggest that neither the NPC1-C-loop nor full-length NPC1 are sufficient to trigger significant fusion at any pH tested. Even the presence of additional factors including a reducing agent, a negatively charged lipid abundant in late endosomes/lysosomes, cathepsins, or the cations Ca + + and K + did not elicit detectable fusion. Taken together, our results suggest that cathepsin primed EBOV-GP requires one or more factors in addition to NPC1 and low pH to mediate a fusion reaction sufficiently robust to allow entry of the EBOV genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication.",

Cells with bound pseudoviruses were then briefly pulsed at pH 5.0, 5.7 or 7.2, cultured for 24 h at 37\u02daC, and assayed for Renilla luciferase as a read-out of fusion, entry, and infection. Binding was conducted at 4\u02daC to prevent pseudovirus internalization and after the pH pulse, the cells were maintained in NH 4 Cl, a lysosomotropic weak base that raises endosomal pH, to prevent fusion that might occur through the normal endocytic route. For these tests we used VSV pseudoviruses expressing 19 kDa EBOV GP, generated by thermolysin cleavage of pseudoviruses expressing full-length GP, as well as ones bearing 21 kDa EBOV GP generated with the furin site mutant described above (S1C Fig). As a control we showed that the infectious levels of the 19 kDa and 21 kDa EBOV GP and LCMV GP pseudoviruses used were similar, and similarly inhibited by NH 4 Cl when the pseudoviruses were allowed to enter cells via the normal endocytic route (Fig 2B) . As seen in Fig 2A, whereas ample FFPM was seen for pseudoviruses bearing LCMV GP, no fusion signal above background was observed with VSV pseudoviruses bearing either form of EBOV-GP cl , at any pH tested.",

Since the findings presented thus far suggested that NPC1 C-Loop and low pH are not sufficient for EBOV-GP cl to mediate complete fusion (leading to content mixing), we next asked whether they are sufficient to mediate an earlier stage, hemifusion. To do this we used the lipid mixing assay employed by Markosyan et al [26] , in which effector cells expressing EBOV-GP cl and labeled with the fluorescent lipid probe DiO are mixed with target cells expressing NPC1 Cloop and labeled with the fluorescent lipid probe DiI. After coculturing and exposure to different pH buffers, the cells are analyzed for hemifusion between effector and target cells by flow cytometry [26] . For our analysis the cell population that had undergone lipid mixing was distinguished from unfused cell pairs by the higher DiI intensity of (hemi)fused cells due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer between DiO and DiI, leading to an enhancement of DiI fluorescence in cells undergoing lipid mixing [32] (S3 Fig). As seen in Fig 1B, whereas a lipid mixing signal was detected with effector cells expressing LCMV GP and treated at pH 5, no hemifusion signal above background was detected for effector cells expressing EBOV-GP cl , whether the target cells did or did not express NPC1 C-Loop at their surface. And this is although the cells expressing EBOV-GP cl showed apparently increased binding to cells that expressed NPC1 C-loop, compared to ones that did not express NPC1 C-loop, at their surface (S3 Fig).

Elevated temperatures also induced the EBOV GP cl ectodomain to bind to liposomes at low pH [23] . However, temperatures as high as 50\u02daC failed to induce GP cl to mediate CCF to target cells expressing NPC1 C-Loop at any pH tested (Fig 3A) . Next, we assessed the effects of the reducing agent TCEP, since reductases are present in late endosomes/lysosomes [36, 37] and since 1-5 mM TCEP caused the ectodomain of EBOV-GP cl to bind to liposomes, an activity diminished with the fusion loop mutant, F535R [23] . However, as seen in Fig 3B, no CCF above background was seen with effector cells expressing EBOV-GP cl in the presence of 5 mM TCEP at any pH tested. While elevated temperature and reducing agent appear sufficient to induce the isolated GP cl ectodomain to bind to liposomes [23] , they are not sufficient to induce full fusion, supporting the notion that an additional factor(s) is (are) required.",

Indeed, Miller et al. showed that while the NPC1-C-Loop could rescue entry and infection of NPC1-knock out cells, the rescue was stronger if knockout cells were complemented with full length NPC1. They also showed, reciprocally, that while an NPC1 construct lacking the C-Loop was strongly impaired for entry and infection, constructs lacking the I or A domains were also impaired, albeit less strongly [10] . In addition, Gong et al. reported that the affinity of GP cl is~10-fold higher to full length NPC1 than to the isolated NPC1 C-loop [47] .",

While NPC1 is mainly found in late endosomes [17, 48] cells may express some endogenous NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5A and 5B , gels of untransfected (-) target cells and control (C) target cell clones) (also see [26] ). In a first set of experiments, we transiently overexpressed NPC1 by transfecting target cells with a plasmid encoding full length NPC1 cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter. Under these conditions, a substantial amount of NPC1 was found at the cell surface, as detected by cell surface biotinylation (Fig 5A, gel of transfected (+) target cells). Cells transiently expressing full length NPC1 at their surface were then tested as targets in the split luciferase CCF assay with effector cells expressing EBOV-GP cl at their surface (Fig 5A, gel of effector cells), as described above. However, as with its C-loop, full-length NPC1 did not elicit detectable content mixing CCF activity for EBOV-GP cl at any pH tested, while LCMV-GP, again, induced robust CCF at low pH (Fig 5A) . As a further test we generated stable clones of HEK293T/17 cells that express significant levels of NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5B, gels of clones N4, N7). Consistent with the findings with transiently transfected cells (Fig 5A) , GP cl -mediated fusion was not detected with target cells that stably express full length NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5B) .

            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly lethal enveloped virus [1] that employs an unusually complex pathway to enter host cells [3] . After engaging attachment factors on the cell surface (which can differ on different cells), EBOV particles are engulfed by macropinocytosis and trafficked via early and late endosomes to an endocytic compartment referred to as a late endosome/lysosome (LE/Lys) [3, 4, [17] [18] [19] 49] . En route the receptor binding subunit of the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) is cleaved by cathepsins B and L to generate a cleaved (~19 kDa) species [5, 6] that binds to the C-Loop of Niemann-Pick-C1 (NPC1), the EBOV endosomal receptor [8] [9] [10] ; fusion then ensues through acidic LE/Lys [18, 19] . For most other enveloped viruses that enter cells through endosomes, even for Lassa virus, the second virus shown to use an intracellular/endosomal receptor [12, 13] , low pH is then sufficient to trigger conformational changes that elicit the fusion activity of the viral fusion GP [16] . The fusion GPs of SARS and MERS coronaviruses additionally require a (post receptor binding) endosomal proteolytic cleavage event [50] [51] [52] [53] .",

While findings stated in Miller et al. indicated that low pH did not trigger recombinant VSV particles bearing EBOV GP cl (the 19 kDa form generated by thermolysin cleavage) to fuse and thereby infect cells expressing NPC1-C-Loop at their surface [10] , Markosyan et al [26] reported that NPC1 at cell surfaces is sufficient to mediate cell-cell fusion (CCF) with cells expressing EBOV GP cl (see below). Because of these conflicting conclusions we re-examined the sufficiency of NPC1 to trigger the fusion activity of EBOV GP cl. In the process, we also assessed the potential enhancing role of additional factors shown, as outlined in the Results section, to augment fusion of other endocytosed enveloped viruses [23, [33] [34] [35] 38, 39, 45, 50, 53] . Our findings are consistent with and extend the result stated by Miller et al. [10] . We found that cells expressing either NPC1-C-Loop or full length NPC1 at their surface did not serve as adequate targets for detectable fusion, at any pH tested, with effector cells or pseudovirus particles bearing EBOV GP cl (19 kDa or 21 kDa forms). Moreover, this apparent insufficiency was seen even if effector-target cell pairs were additionally exposed to elevated temperature, a reducing agent, Ca ++ , K + , the anionic lipid BMP, or cathepsins B and L.",

They concluded that very small, non-expanding fusion pores formed at both neutral and (more quickly) low pH (optimally at pH 5.7). While we employed the delivery and expression of luciferase reporter plasmids as a (different, but highly sensitive) content mixing assay, we used the same lipid mixing assay as Markosyan et al., and as per Gomez-Icazbalceta et al. [32] , gated out bound (adhered) but unfused cell pairs (S3 Fig). With these means of analysis we did not observe a detectable lipid mixing signal with effector cells bearing EBOV GP cl , at any pH tested, while lipid mixing was detected with effector cells bearing LCMV GP at pH 5. Our disparate lipid mixing results could be due to technical and analytical differences. Irrespectively, the small non-expanding fusion pores reported by Markosyan et al. [26] would likely not lead to productive viral infection, being too small to pass a viral nucleocapsid. Hence, we conclude that NPC1 and low pH are not sufficient to drive the fusion activity of EBOV GP cl . This conclusion is consistent with x-ray analysis of the GP cl -NPC1-C-loop complex, indicating that only small, but likely important, conformational changes occur when EBOV GP cl binds to NPC1-C-Loop at pH 5.5 (albeit as seen in crystals formed at 18\u02daC). For example, there was no evidence that binding of NPC1 to EBOV GP cl (at low pH and 18\u02daC) causes expulsion of the fusion loop from the body of the GP cl trimer [54] .",

[10] and presented in Figs 1, 2 and 5, we postulated that a factor(s) in addition to low pH and NPC1 is needed to elicit the fusion activity of EBOV GP cl . We therefore tested factors required for fusion or uncoating of other endocytosed enveloped viruses (Ca ++ , K + , BMP, proteases) [38, 39, 41, 45, 53] , proposed for EBOV in particular (Ca ++ , additional cathepsin action, reducing agent) [6, 25, 55] , and even the non-physiological condition of elevated temperature, which can substitute for biological viral fusion triggers [33] [34] [35] . However, none of these factors or treatments elicited detectable CCF between effector cells bearing EBOV GP cl and target cells bearing NPC1 or its C-Loop (at any pH tested), while robust CCF was consistently detected with effector cells bearing LCMV GP at low pH. Although we cannot rule out that one of the tested additional factors induced hemifusion or small non-expanding fusion pores, or that CCF would be observed with a combination of these factors, we favor the hypothesis that the fusion activity of EBOV GP cl requires NPC1, low pH and a yet to be identified, likely endosomal, factor. The initial observation indicating a need for an additional factor was that pseudovirus particles bearing 19 kDa EBOV GP are not infectious if target cells are pretreated with a lysosomotropic agent (which raises endosomal pH) or with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d [6] , findings that have been confirmed by others [20] . In this context it is interesting that Spence et al. [19] recently found, in live cell imaging studies employing VSV particles bearing EBOV GP cl , that the E64d-sensitive step follows hemifusion, i.e. is at the stage of fusion pore formation or particle uncoating. On the other hand, we have observed fusion of the isolated EBOV fusion loop [21, 56] and of EBOV GP2 reconstituted into proteoliposomes [57] with liposomes at low pH, suggesting that a major role of NPC1 and the additional factor may be to move GP1 sufficiently out of the way so that GP2 can proceed along the fusion pathway [16] .",

            "text": "There are additional caveats to our inability to detect a fusion signal for EBOV GP cl under any of the conditions tested. For one, the density of NPC1 (or its C-loop) at the surfaces of the target cells employed may not have been high enough, in conjunction with low pH at 37\u02daC, to trigger fusion. Secondly, although we tested adding the LE/Lys-abundant lipid BMP, which is needed for full fusion by Dengue and Uukuniemi viruses [45, 46] , the plasma membrane lipid composition may not support EBOV GP cl -mediated fusion, which is designed to occur in LE/ Lys; the plasma membrane and LE/Lys membrane have different lipid compositions [43, 44] . Or, the plasma membrane may contain a lipid or protein factor that is inhibitory to EBOV GP cl -mediated fusion. Another possibility is that an additional LE/Lys membrane protein, for example TPC2, is required. TPC2 is a membrane protein that mediates Ca ++ efflux out of LE/ Lys [58] ; cells lacking TPC2 are strongly impaired for EBOV infection [25] . Perhaps TPC2 is needed to maintain a precise local concentration of Ca ++ not mimicked in our experiments. Ca ++ could be needed to stabilize the structure of the fusion loop, or for the fusion loop to interact with the LE/Lys lipid bilayer [38] [39] [40] . And lastly, another membrane protein in LE/ Lys or a specific soluble component present in the lumen of LE/Lys (ion, small molecule, protein) could be required for EBOV GP cl to mediate robust fusion. Indeed, multiple factors could be needed to maintain a precise ionic milieu in the endosomal lumen [59] needed to support EBOV fusion. In this context it is potentially interesting that lipid and ion transporter proteins emerged in a recent Crispr screen for host factors required for EBOV infection [60] .",

The bound (B) population represents cells that are adhered, but not fused. The inset Table gives the %B and %F (of all stained cells) for the indicated FACS plots. (TIFF) S4 Fig. NPC1-C-loop, low pH and cations (Ca ++ or K + ) are not sufficient to trigger detectable FFPM of pseudoviruses bearing EBOV GP cl . (A) VSV pseudoviruses bearing the indicated GP were bound to pre-cooled COS7 cells, either untransfected (-) or transfected to express surface-directed NPC1-C-loop (+). After binding in the cold (to prevent internalization), cells were pulsed at the indicated pH for 5 min at 37\u02daC in fusion buffer containing, where indicated, 2 mM Ca ++ or 140 mM K + . The cells were then re-neutralized and treated with 40 mM NH 4 Cl to raise endosomal pH. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and assessed for the ratio of Renilla luciferase activity (virus replication) over firefly luciferase activity (number of cells). (B) In the same experiment, equal inputs of the pseudoviruses used in (A) were added to cells, either mock-treated or pre-treated with 40 mM NH 4 Cl, and incubated for 24 h at 37\u02daC. At this time, they were analyzed for Renilla divided by firefly luciferase activity. In both panels, results are shown as means +/-SD of triplicate samples from one experiment. Statistical analyses in (A) are shown as the comparison of each sample with the pH 7.4 sample within each group. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p< 0.0001 based on a two-way ANOVA test. (TIFF) S5 Fig. Assessment of pre-activated cathepsins used for experiments depicted in Figs 4B and 6B. (A) Triplicate samples of pre-activated cathepsin B (left) and L (right) used for the experiment depicted in Fig 4B were mock-treated or treated with 1 \u03bcM CA074 or 10 \u03bcM E64d, respectively for 15 min at RT. Cathepsin substrates (see Methods section) were added and samples were incubated for 5 min at 37\u02daC. Cathepsin activity was then measured by reading Ex. 360/Em. 460 in a Biotek plate reader. (B) The same analyses conducted for pre-activated cathepsin B (left) and L (right) used for the experiment depicted in Fig 6B. Results are shown as means +/-SD of triplicate samples from the experiments conducted in parallel with those displayed in Figs 4B and 6B. Statistics are based on Student's t-test. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p < 0.0001. (TIFF)",
