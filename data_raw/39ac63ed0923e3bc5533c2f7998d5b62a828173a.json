The strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) was calculated using the negative (NT) and positive (MX1) controls. (b) Workflow illustration of the primary and secondary siRNA screens. In the primary genome-wide screen, siRNA pools (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting 18119 genes were assessed for effects on virus replication in A549-MxA cells. 276 hits were identified based on an average Z-score > 2 across triplicates. A secondary screen was performed on these genes where the 4 siRNAs from the pool were individually assessed. 41 hits were identified with p < 0.05.(c) Distribution of the 18119 genes based on their Z-score.

Strep-tagged proteins were precipitated with streptavidin and the eluates visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver stain. Positions of GFP and MxA are indicated. Bioinformatic analysis and siRNA validation. (a) Workflow illustration of the bioinformatic analysis. Results from both RNAi and proteomic screens were combined and analyzed to look at the canonical pathways, upstream regulators and protein-protein interaction enrichment. For each analysis, a list of enriched terms was obtained. We considered all terms with p-value < 0.01 and their corresponding genes. By overlaying them we identified 13 factors shared in all enrichment lists. (b) The 13 factors were silenced individually on A549-MxA cells to evaluate the effect on reporter virus activity. For this purpose A549-MxA cells were transfected with either a NT control siRNA, an MxA-targeting (MX1) siRNA (targeting the MX1 gene and using the siRNA originally utilized for the genome-wide siRNA screen (Qiagen SI05459538) or one of 4 siRNAs targeting the respective gene identified by the bioinformatic analysis. 72 h post transfection A549-MxA cells were infected with H5N1-RL at an MOI of 8. 24 h post infection reporter activity was evaluated using Renilla-Glo substrate (Promega).
