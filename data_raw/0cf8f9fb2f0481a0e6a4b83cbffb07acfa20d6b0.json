The article draws on recent advances in data visualisation and analytics with the aim of informing upcoming international policy debates on the governance of synthetic biology by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. We use mapping techniques to identify how synthetic biology can best be understood and the range of institutions, researchers and funding agencies involved. Debates under the Convention are likely to focus on a possible moratorium on the field release of synthetic organisms, cells or genomes. Based on the empirical evidence we propose that guidance could be provided to funding agencies to respect the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity in making research investments. Building on the recommendations of the United States Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues we demonstrate that it is possible to promote independent and transparent monitoring of developments in synthetic biology using modern information tools. In particular, public and policy understanding and engagement with synthetic biology can be enhanced through the use of online interactive tools. As a step forward in this process we make existing data on the scientific literature on synthetic biology available in an online interactive workbook so that researchers, policy makers and civil society can explore the data and draw conclusions for themselves.",

Pioneering work by NGOs such as the ETC Group and headlines announcing the creation of artificial life have increasingly brought policy attention to bear on synthetic biology [13] . In April of 2012 the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will consider the potential implications of synthetic biology as a new and emerging issue. Recommendations from SBSTTA will then go forward to the Eleventh meeting of the governing Conference of the Parties (COP11) in India in October 2012 for a decision.",

The choices made in the development of search strategies affect the number and nature of the results. Thus, searches of the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge capture a wide range of results across disciplines and publication sources but are very limited in terms of data fields for analysis. In contrast, Thomson Reuters Web of Science provides a narrower spectrum of results from three major scientific indexes and conference proceedings but includes all major data fields for analysis. We selected Web of Science because of the large range of fields available for text mining and analysis using software tools such as Vantage Point from Search Technology Inc. All databases suffer from lag times between the publication of articles and their appearance in databases.",

We engaged in experimentation with a range of search terms using corpus linguistics approaches and Natural Language Processing to identify individual words and phrases of relevance from samples of articles from Web of Science and reports on synthetic biology. This revealed that, in the absence of a controlled vocabulary, the terms used in synthetic biology such as biotechnology or protein engineering are rapidly swamped by uses of the same terms in other research areas. While it is tempting to use ever more refined terms we came to the conclusion that synthetic biology is a self-defining community of researchers from a variety of disciplines who are articulating themselves around the term synthetic biology and related terms such as synthetic genomics. For this reason a simple search strategy focusing on ''synthetic biology'', ''synthetic genomics'', ''synthetic genome'' and ''synthetic genomes'' was used to capture the core landscape. Other important contributions to the field are captured through analysis of cited literature and exploration of the landscape of researchers citing work in synthetic biology within their publications (below).",

Publications citing this core landscape were also selected in Web of Science to exclude selfcitations, deduplicated and processed in Vantage Point. The processed data was then geocoded using Yahoo Place Finder and exported for visualisation and geographical mapping in Tableau Desktop and Gephi network mapping software. Data was prepared for display in Tableau Public by splitting relevant fields to extract values (i.e. country names). Gephi visualisations deployed the Fruchterman-Reingold and Force Atlas algorithms with nodes manually adjusted to ensure label clarity.

The first class focus on assembling nonnatural or synthetic components to create chemical systems that support Darwinian or biological evolution. The second class are informed by engineering and focus on extracting interchangeable parts from living systems to create construction units and devices that may or may not be analogous with existing biological systems (Benner and Sismour 2005: 553) Both classes focus on the chemical synthesis of biological components ranging from gene circuits to entire genomes.

            "text": "Scientometrics approaches typically use key words and phrases to explore emerging areas of science [32, 33] . A total of 36,262 individual words and phrases from the titles, abstracts and author key words of publications were available for analysis from our dataset of 1,255 publications. These terms were then reduced to 24,023 multi-word phrases and composite terms (i.e. biotechnology, bionanotechnology) to focus on meaningful concepts and categories. The terms were then grouped using word stemming to capture variations of leading terms i.e. biological systems AND artificial biological systems or metabolic engineering AND metabolic pathway engineering. This method revealed that 356 terms capture 99% of records on synthetic biology. As we might expect, the top unifying term is synthetic biology. When synthetic biology was excluded the remaining 355 terms captured 88% of records providing sufficient accuracy for representation of the data. The 355 terms were then placed in a co-occurrence matrix that provides a quantitative measure of the number of records for each term (nodes) and the strength of connections between terms (edges). These relationships were then visualised using the open source Gephi network analysis software ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 reveals that synthetic biology is concerned with biological systems using approaches from systems biology directed to biotechnology that involves gene expression, gene networks, metabolic engineering and genetic circuits, synthetic genes and synthetic networks. As we move from central terms to the outer periphery of the network less frequent terms such as biosafety, bioethics, and intellectual property emerge to reveal the wider spectrum of issues revolving around the core of synthetic biology. Figure 3 narrows the focus to the top ranking phrases and composite terms in more than 20 records across the dataset. In considering these results it may be tempting to widen the search criteria for synthetic biology to include additional top occurring key terms to enhance data capture. For example, synthetic biology is strongly associated with systems biology, protein engineering, genetic engineering and nanotechnology. However, synthetic biology would immediately be swamped by the results from these much larger fields. In practice, synthetic biology is being constructed from a combination of convergences and overlaps with other areas of science and technology, some of which, such as metabolic engineering, are new and emerging areas of research. Our understanding of the distinctiveness of synthetic biology is improved by removing dominant terms to expose underlying networks. This approach revealed the prominence of relations between genetic circuits, gene networks, synthetic genes, synthetic systems and gene regulatory networks [34, 35] . Viewed from this perspective synthetic biology is being constructed from a core of work around genetic circuits and networks. Much attention has understandably focused on the potential implications of synthetic cells, genomes and organisms. However, the creation of synthetic circuits, synthetic genes, and synthetic gene networks may eventually be more likely to find routine expression in organisms and make their way into the wider environment.",

Figure 8 provides a summary of the top 30 references cited inside the core landscape. This data is accessible in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. The top 5 publications cited inside this community are work by Elowitz [34] on transcriptional regulation, Gardner [59] on a toggle switch in E. coli, Gibson et. al [60] on the complete chemical synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome, Endy [26] on engineering biology and Benner and Sismour [25] on synthetic biology.

In the absence of such unifying terms, the citing landscape is diffuse and characterised by low frequency terms relative to the size of the landscape. However, at the apex of this landscape we find concentrations in work on E. coli by researchers in synthetic biology such as Collins [76] , along with the prominence of terms such as gene expression [77] , systems biology [78] and metabolic engineering [79] . The citing landscape is also important as an indicator of knowledge transfer between countries and the emergence of research groups informed by work in synthetic biology. The citing landscape encompasses researchers from 78 countries. What is immediately apparent is that countries such as China have risen from 10 th place in the core landscape to 4 th place and India has risen from 18 th to 16 th place while Brazil has also risen in the rankings. What is less apparent is that researchers from the Africa region are also beginning to appear in the literature. Examples of this development include Egypt for chemoenzymatic and microbial dynamic kinetic resolutions [80] , Ghana on the SARS coronavirus in bats [81] , Nigeria in the case of an ethnobotanical survey and cytotoxicity testing in plants for potential cancer treatments [82] and South Africa in research on synthetic promoters and genetic control through cis engineering [83] .

In the case of the journal literature, a quantitative insight into this influence is provided by comparing Thomson Reuters Web of Science journal subject categories from the core and the citing landscape ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9 makes clear that the core of synthetic biology is strongly situated in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, followed by Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology and the interdisciplinary Science & Technology category. In the citing landscape these categories are reinforced and shift in importance notably through the influence of synthetic biology in chemistry. The impacts of synthetic biology are also observed in the emergence of publications in Virology, Environmental Sciences and Ecology, for subjects such as bioremediation, and Immunology focusing on areas such as antibiotics, biofilms and vaccine. Data on journal subject categories for the citing landscape can be explored in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. Future work in exploring the emerging scientific landscape for synthetic biology could build upon recent efforts to map the structure of the scientific literature using journal subject categories and situate synthetic biology within this structure [84] [85] [86] .",

Furthermore, data is restricted to information in Web of Science, lacks standards of description, and does not provide an insight into the size of awards. However, it is possible to gain a partial insight into the nature of funding organizations and emerging networks of funding organizations. After cleaning the raw data we identified approximately 530 organizations as funding sources for synthetic biology.

Under Article 3(g) of the Cartagena Protocol a living modified organism ''means any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology.'' Article 3(i) defines modern biotechnology as: ''a) in vitro nucleic acid techniques, including recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and direct injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or b) Fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family that overcome natural physiological reproductive or recombination barriers and that are not techniques used in traditional breeding and selection.'' The Cartagena Protocol establishes an advanced informed agreement procedure to provide countries with a basis for making informed decisions on whether to accept shipments of LMOs meeting the above criteria. In October 2010 the Tenth Conference of the Parties adopted the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This protocol establishes international rules and procedures on liability and redress relating to living modified organisms. These rules cover situations involving damage arising from transboundary movements of LMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, for what is called ''contained use'' (i.e. in industrial facilities) and intentional introduction into the environment. The rules also address damage arising from authorized use of LMOs and unintentional and illegal transboundary movements.",

Furthermore, it may be that the Cartagena protocol only applies to the physical transfer of LMOs and does not apply to material or digital transfers of genetic sequences, components and parts that may be later used to constitute an LMO [119] . Additional doubts have also been expressed about whether the waiver on the requirement for advanced informed agreement for transfers of LMOs destined for contained use in a facility under Article 6.2 of the Cartagena protocol should apply in the case of synthetic organisms [119] . In the case of the Kuala Lumpur supplementary protocol, this is limited in three ways. First, the rules apply only to transboundary movements that occur after the supplementary protocol has entered into force. Second, the rules are restricted to damage occurring in areas under national jurisdiction (i.e. excluding the high seas and treaty areas such as Antarctica). Third, in the case of damage arising from transboundary movements of LMOs from countries that are not party to the supplementary protocol then Parties are only able to apply domestic implementing legislation for the protocol, rather than seeking redress through an international body.",

In presenting its report the ''PCBSI concluded that synthetic biology is capable of significant but limited achievements posing limited risks. Future developments may raise further objections, but the Commission found no reason to endorse additional federal regulations or a moratorium on work in this field at this time. Instead, the Commission urges monitoring and dialogue between the private and public sectors to achieve open communication and cooperation'' (PCBSI 2010: v) . In arriving at this conclusion the Commission sought to find a middle ground between a moratorium on synthetic biology pending assessment of all risks and ''unfettered freedom for scientific exploration''. The Commission recommended ''an ongoing process of prudent vigilance that carefully monitors, identifies and mitigates potential and realized harms over time'' (PCBSI 2010: 8) . With respect to moral objections, the Commission argued that ''Current objections to synthetic biology on moral grounds are often based on concerns regarding activities that the field is currently incapable of carrying out'' (PCBSI 2010: 12).",

In practice, therefore the recommendations from civil society organizations and the US Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, as the major government sponsored review to date, are not incompatible in their main elements focusing on environmental risk and uncertainty.

The implications for synthetic biologists would need to be balanced against the fundamental importance of biological diversity to human welfare.

This approach would recognise the presently limited nature of synthetic biology research directed to field release and the limitations of existing research on engineered biocontainment and control strategies. The existence of a moratorium might, as an incidental benefit, send a strong signal to the 'biohacking' community on the acceptable limits of behaviour and encourage wider professionalisation in a field involving a meeting of different disciplines and standards.

As a contribution to debate on this issue we have established that the core landscape for synthetic biology involves 2,934 researchers from 682 organizations in 40 countries who are supported by a network of approximately 530 funding organizations. These researchers are engaged in work on genetic components, parts and organisms with potential for a wide range of applications. This community has demonstrated a considerable willingness to engage with civil society and policy and to consider appropriate measures for governance. However, at this early stage in the development of this field proposals regarding biocontainment and control remain under developed. In considering the introduction of a possible moratorium on field release Parties will be confronted by the challenge of balancing the fundamental importance of biodiversity to human welfare with recognition of the importance of the ''freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity'' as set out in Article 15.3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.",

Finally, the core contribution of this article has been to promote the development of longer term monitoring capacity. Taken together we believe that these proposals can help ensure that any action taken under the Convention is balanced and measured and does not unnecessarily impinge on positive developments in research while remaining attentive to the significant potential negative impacts of synthetic biology and the need to ensure they are objectively assessed and addressed.",
