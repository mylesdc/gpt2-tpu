            "text": "Background: In 2006, Malawi developed a national influenza plan to mitigate, prevent and manage the burden of infection should an outbreak occur. In 2009, it translated its contingency plan to respond to the unfolding influenza pandemic. However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. Objective: To investigate how Malawi translated its preparedness plan and so broaden our understanding of the outcomes of the responses. Methods: We draw on data from 22 in-depth interviews with government policymakers and people working at a policy level in various non-governmental organisations, conducted to assess the level of preparedness and the challenges of translating this. Results: Through a number of public health initiatives, authorities developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance activities and updated overall goals in pandemic training and education. However, without influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan, activating the pandemic plan, including coordinating and deploying generic infection control measures, was problematic. Responses during the pandemic were at times 'weak and clumsy' and failed to mirror the activities and processes highlighted in the preparedness plan. Conclusions: Participants stressed that in order to achieve a coordinated and successful response to mitigate and prevent the further transmission of pandemic influenza, good preparation was critical. The key elements which they identified as relevant for a rapid response included effective communications, robust evidence-based decision-making, strong and reliable surveillance systems and flexible public health responses. To effectively articulate a viable trajectory of pandemic responses, the potential value of simulation exercises could be given more consideration as a mean of sustaining good levels of preparedness and responses against future pandemics. These all demand a well-structured planning for and response to pandemic influenza strategy developed by a functioning scientific and policy advisory committee.",

Prior to this, there was an incident in Ntchisi, central region of the country in December 2005, where thousands of sick migratory birds (fork-tailed drongos) dropped dead from the sky, precipitating fear of an avian flu outbreak in the country. The large wetlands around the Lake of Malawi provide a high risk of HPAI, creating an ideal breeding ground for the avian virus in seasonal migratory birds. As a result of these threats, an avian preparedness team was established, led by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and supported by the Ministry of Health (MoH).",

Epidemiological data on 2009 pandemic influenza in Malawi is scarce and during the 2009 pandemic influenza no death related to influenza was reported.

The taskforce met regularly to discuss and provide scientific advice on the management strategies and operational emergency responses required should a pandemic be declared in Malawi. Despite these meetings, and the existence of a formal plan, progress towards influenza preparedness across the country was slow, with the MoH facing numerous practical challenges [7] . These included the lack of an effective influenza surveillance system to send early signals of impending influenza activity in human and animal populations, and the lack of mechanisms to provide information to health services at the district level for the prevention, treatment and control of influenza. These operational challenges raised concerns about whether specific responses to planning for and response to pandemic influenza (PRPI), as characterised in the national plan, were achievable.

The interview guide included the following questions: (1) How would you describe the influenza preparedness plan before 2009? (2) How did you translate the pandemic plan into response actions during the 2009 pandemic outbreak? (3) What were the main operational problems, challenges and lessons learnt from the 2009 pandemic? and (4) How did you resolve problems during the 2009 pandemic? Before each interview, the researcher introduced himself and explained the purpose of the interview. Interview duration varied but ranged from 48 to 145 minutes (mean 70). Extended interviews afforded us in-depth data rather than breadth data that would cover all themes. This enabled us to build a convincing analytical narrative [17] . We were interested in individual perceptions and narratives of the processes, policies and programs, not in generalisability, and in this context, we were not concerned with generalising among participants.",

We used the six thematic areas of preparedness and responses set out in the WHO checklist [18] as a framework of analysis to identify respondents' views on the levels of preparedness, responses, strengths and weakness. These included planning and coordination, surveillance, communication, public health interventions, patient management and maintaining essential services. With these thematic areas in mind, coding was adopted, with the text examined closely, line by line, to identify both pre-defined and new themes. Generating codes involved three stages. The first was open coding, where interesting features of the data were identified, labelled and defined. Initial codes matching data extracts were collated by labelling and assigning a selection of unique identifiers of text within each data item. The second phase proceeded by reviewing and refining themes in which the connections between concepts (such as planning and public health infrastructure) were explored to help build categories and interrelationships. Here, we considered whether predefined themes and sub-themes formed a coherent pattern and if not, whether this was problematic. Themes that did not fit particular data extracts were redefined or discarded. The third phase involved searching selective coding, where predefined themes were further defined and refined. Throughout the process, codes identified in the data, predefined themes and categories were subjected to an iterative process, involving constant testing of data, confirming or negating the concepts, until the patterns in the data were clearly understood. This provided structure to the extracted data and interpretation in the final analysis.",

Malawi also participated in the deployment of H1N1 vaccines funded by the WHO and other donors, an action not part of the initial preparedness plan but incorporated in response to donor recommendations. As part of the response, Malawi established influenza surveillance at ports of entry, with routine checks for suspected cases, and suspected samples were sent to Kenya for diagnostic confirmation. Hence, as one participant remarked, 'despite the lack of labs, we managed to set up surveillance networks within the country and this paid off by picking up four confirmed cases' (P21).

Preparedness prior to 2009 H1N1 had failed to account for other influenza viruses subtypes, such as H1, H2, H3, H7 or H9, although most policymakers believed these subtypes posed pandemic risks too.

Another respondent, a lay person who was involved in implementation, argued that preparedness required the use of the available infrastructure, such as existing surveillance systems and laboratories. However, in Malawi, key infrastructure was severely limited, hence the use of diagnostic laboratories in Kenya. Establishing new infrastructure such as laboratories during emergency situations is practically impossible, given that this would take several years. For most respondents, the only way to achieve responses that mirrored preparedness plans was to improve health services generally, but essential services to facilitate rapid diagnostic, care and monitoring of disease spread all needed strengthening. A few respondents identified existing infrastructures, such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS), an information technology system that could have been deployed and adapted to provide timely information on influenza outbreaks. Respondents across the interviews were aware that having a functional information technology system would ensure the easy flow of information about the pandemic outbreaks, specifically to inform public health policy about, for example, whether additional staff were needed. Several suggested linking this with the integrated disease surveillance response (IDSR) system for management of health information, including planning for and management of health services.",

Surveillance at the time, however, included only screening for possible influenza cases at country borders. Activities were incomplete prior to and during the pandemic, and were characterised by poor reporting, lack of surveillance systems and infrastructure. Adequate reporting would have required building the capacity of the virology reference laboratory to conduct appropriate tests and collect appropriate and timely data to characterise the epidemic by person, place and time.

According to Parsons, social agents (i.e. authorities able to take action) and social structures (i.e. surveillance and health systems) are both important determining factors for action [20] . Holm also reiterates that decision-making occurs not in a vacuum, but by social agents at large, by the general social environment, and by organisational features such as those of health care institutions [21] .",

A number of important weaknesses were identified in the robustness of influenza surveillance systems intended to send early signals for health service response, including the lack of efficient and timely decision-making among policymakers to guide public health policy on influenza. The WHO recommends reinforcement of routine surveillance capacity both from an epidemiological and virological standpoint to monitor influenza. This requires collection of sickness reports combined with laboratory and clinical investigations as valuable indicators of the occurrence of influenza. It is essential to monitor for influenza-like illnesses (ILI), including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) during influenza season and non-season periods. Unless these ILI and SARI are characterised and monitored, policymakers will not be well informed on the burden of respiratory diseases in order to prioritise resources and plan public health interventions to mitigate influenza infections. Institutions within existing systems, such as hospitals and laboratories, need to document and assess influenza data. This can be undertaken using surveillance techniques such as reporting ILI or SARI, and absenteeism in work place and schools.",

At the same time, pandemic influenza is a serious threat, with a large population at risk of infection in a relatively short period of time. Even mild to moderate illness in the population can significantly disrupt social life and economic activities, with one study suggesting that pandemic influenza could reduce GDP by 0.5-4.3% [22] . A WHO study conducted in Thailand, Uganda and South Africa, for example, suggested that the 2009-2010 pandemic influenza contributed to a GDP loss of up to 0.05% of these countries [23] . In many respects, where resources are limited, pandemic influenza can be responded to in the same way as seasonal influenza and other respiratory infections such as TB. However, if PRPI is to be sustainable and sensitive to context, there is a need for internal funding and the development of command structures that do not heavily rely on external funding. Business continuity planning is required by both health and non-health sectors to complement and consolidate national plans, and to ensure continuation of the vital day-to-day functions of the society. For example, a business plan in the health sector may need to consider alternative power sources, if routine supplies affect operations due to constant surges, blackouts, and/or chronic shortages of fuel.",

Due to the lack of country funds for the PRPI, policymakers fully endorsed and adopted the WHO universal guidelines on pandemic influenza, without taking into account the local context. We argue that it is not possible to simply apply a graded series of responses to emerging pandemic viruses; this requires the Pandemic Severity Index (PSI) to be calibrated to the case fatality ratio to determine actions ranging from limited to stringent measures [24] .",

Such decisions highlight the need for consistent public health actions to aid early detection and control. Difficulties in governance reflect inadequate preparedness for a number of planning activities, including vaccination and behaviour communication.

While financial and human resources are also needed to operate surveillance activities that support regular diagnoses of influenza and monitoring seasonal-like influenza through sentinel surveillance and laboratory tests, setting up and managing a good surveillance system for influenza in Malawi would not be a small task. Thus we suggest a number of cheap alternative types of surveillance could be used to survey and monitor influenza. For example, Outpatient Illness Surveillance was not emphasised by authorities in clinics or hospitals, and no information was stored or collected on flu patients visiting these institutions prior to the pandemic. No efforts were made to engage with alternative providers, which might have been critical had hospitals and clinics been overwhelmed with an unusually high number of patients. Preparedness plans need to take account of how the health sector can engage with different publics, traditional healers or volunteers from non-health sectors to reduce the demand and burden of patient care in case of surge turnout in crisis situations.",

Consistent with findings by Ortu and colleagues [7] of pandemic plans elsewhere in Africa, there were serious gaps and mistakes in government efforts, priorities and service objectives impacting PRPI, and little political will from politicians. For example, the planning process laid out a one-off budget system as a cheap option for response activities, but, as argued in an editorial in Nature, this is an unsustainable way to address pandemic threats in the 21st century [27] . The 57th WMA General Assembly held in South Africa emphasised that the importance of political will to fund public health preparedness is paramount to dealing with pandemic threats [28] .",

Although discrepancies are expected in any pandemic planning nationally or internationally due to the uncertainty associated with pandemics, it is important to have a consistent basis for planning, especially if it is to be applied at both local and national levels. While Malawi developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance and updated overall goals in PRPI, most response actions addressing the 2009 pandemic failed to achieve the important public health goals that the plans set out. We found that the national pandemic plan was not updated regularly and experts in influenza emergency management were rarely consulted. A number of gaps in national action were also identified, including poor coordination between national policymakers with local stakeholders, weak leadership in the influenza working committee and lack of surveillance structures such as IACs and diagnostic laboratories. There is need for coordination between the private and public sectors in order to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Cooperation on influenza activities would reinforce the implementation of PRPI, but this would require that responsibilities and actions are defined phase by phase. Influenza research focusing on the national and local context is important to manage challenges and problems that might be experienced during the influenza outbreak. In addition, there is need for political interventions to improve pharmaceutical logistics which in turn would improve the availability of vaccines and other drugs, enabling people to be vaccinated on time during seasonal and pandemic periods. However, there is also a need to ensure that the public is aware that influenza is a reportable disease. Most importantly, there is a need to upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity, to include active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. In general, PRPI operations can be strengthened through effective IEC activities such as communicating real time surveillance data or communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (both seasonally and during pandemics) to the general public. This can be done by electronic means, phones and meetings. The regular dissemination of such information may change public attitudes and perceptions about influenza.",

Scott has suggested that emergency management begin at the local level because disasters are local [35] . In this study, policymakers identified finances as barriers to planning, and while we appreciate the significance of what money does, PRPI cannot be determined only by its budget. A number of financial agreements may need to be established with developmental partners in order to strengthen capacity in areas such as education and to resource laboratory surveillance.

Simulation exercises would be a particularly valuable tool to improve preparedness to ensure that specific tasks, functions and skills are met in real pandemic scenarios. Simulation exercises act as a policy tool that informs policymakers to take proactive and timely actions as part of response measures. A PRPI model that also takes into consideration the 'prevention of ethical problems' will enable policymakers to evaluate interventions that may maintain operational readiness during a pandemic. Most importantly, lessons could be drawn regarding the need to strengthen health systems for district health service planning in compliance with infection control standards and PRPI themes such as communication, monitoring and surveillance, and prevention. The best way to respond effectively to a pandemic is to prepare for the worst. Being prepared for, and responding to, influenza pandemics requires having well-trained epidemiologists, a functional public health service, reliable surveillance system, laboratories, and efficient communication channels.

Recommendations Governance and decision-makingNeed for sustainable influenza funding and development of command structures that must not heavily rely on external funding. Need for efficient and timely decision-making from policymakers in the Ministry of Health in order to offer guidance on public health policy on influenza. Coordination and advise Need for plans at the local level that engage local people, families and medical personnel to ensure local services are running smoothly during the pandemic period. Need for private and public partnership to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Need for external research cooperation and reinforce ongoing cooperation. Responsibilities and actions needs to be defined phase by phase. Politics, science and policy Need to vaccinate timely (seasonal and pandemic). Need for influenza research focusing on the national and local context in order to manage challenges and problems anticipated during the influenza outbreak. Border control such as screening need to be improved. Need for political intervention to improve pharmaceutical logistics in acquiring vaccines and other drugs. Need for effective hospital control policies. Key infrastructure for PRPI Need for strengthening health services operations and making sure non pharmaceutical (hygiene and sanitation) and pharmaceutical products (vaccines and antibiotics) for mitigating influenza are available on time.Information, education and communicationNeed for an effective programme to change public attitudes and perceptions about influenza. Need to strengthen communication by electronic means, phone, and meetings. Need for communicating real time and hypothetical surveillance data. Need for communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (seasonal and pandemic). Prevention, mitigation and containment Need for Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) case investigation by interviewing patient cases and carrying out surveys for possible sources and make public aware that ILI is reportable. Need for surveillance working groups and need for reporting absenteeism in work place and schools. Upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity including active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. Need for influenza web reporting systems. Need for rapid test technology in rural areas.",
