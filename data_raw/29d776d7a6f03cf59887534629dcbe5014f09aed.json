Using the programmable interfaces provided by Google and MSN, we created three interactive demonstrator maps of England's Strategic Health Authorities. These can be browsed online at http://www.healthcybermap.org/GoogleMapsAPI/ -Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface) version, http://www.healthcybermap.org/ GoogleEarthKML/ -Google Earth KML (Keyhole Markup Language) version, and http:// www.healthcybermap.org/MSNVirtualEarth/ -MSN Virtual Earth Map Control version. Google and MSN's worldwide distribution of \"free\" geospatial tools, imagery, and maps is to be commended as a significant step towards the ultimate \"wikification\" of maps and GIS. A discussion is provided of these emerging online mapping trends, their expected future implications and development directions, and associated individual privacy, national security and copyrights issues. Although ESRI have announced their planned response to Google (and MSN), it remains to be seen how their envisaged plans will materialize and compare to the offerings from Google and MSN, and also how Google and MSN mapping tools will further evolve in the near future.",

Thanks to Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface -http://www.google.com/apis/maps/), many third party applications and custom annotated maps have begun to appear [2] . Two good UK examples of such applications/custom annotated maps are the Health QOF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) Database map http:/ /www.gpcontract.co.uk/map.html and London July 2005 Terrorist Attacks map http://geepster.com/london.php. (But because Google Maps has its roots in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), users were also able to produce their own custom annotated Google maps, e.g., based on their own GPS (Global Positioning System) locational data, and to even tie in images and video to create interactive multimedia maps, well before the API was publicly documented [3] .) Smugmug Maps http://maps.smugmug.com/ is another good example of a third-party Google Maps application in action. Smugmug, a photo hosting Web site, plots geocoded photographs to their actual locations on Google Maps (or Google Earth via a KML Google Earth feed: http:www.smugmug.com/hacfeed.mg?Type=geoAll&for-mat=kml20&Size=Tiny), and allows location-based searching of photographs all over the world [4] . All smugmug RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds are now geoenabled. If a photo has latitude, longitude, and altitude information (geographic metadata), it will show up in all feeds (see http://www.smug mug.com/help/rss-atofeeds). ",

ESRI's response to all of the recent online consumer geoinformatics services described in this article was to announce (in 2005) its new partnership with National Geographic http://www.nationalgeographic.com/, GlobeXplorer http://www.globexplorer.com/, and TeleAtlas http:// www.teleatlas.com/, plus Geospatial One Stop (GOShttp://www.geo-one-stop.gov/) and a few other partners like MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.http://www.mda.ca/), to upgrade the National Geographic MapMachine http://plasma.nationalgeo graphic.com/mapmachine/, a map service/online atlas that provides global map coverage for an extensive set of Earth science themes. MapMachine was first launched in November 1999, and is powered by ESRI's ArcWeb Services http://www.esri.com/software/arcwebservices/. The planned upgrade aims at bringing satellite imagery, aerial photos, and street-level data to MapMachine users. Users will be able to access the service through a new viewer that is aimed at a mass audience, and appears to be ESRI's direct response to Google Earth and Microsoft Virtual Earth. However, one important difference from those services is that the ArcGIS back end will also allow users of the new service to accomplish much more sophisticated tasks, such as service area analysis. The next generation of MapMachine will also provide a link to GOS data and metadata to help users discover information about their area of interest or study. MapMachine will include capabilities for 3D globe services, allowing GIS users to \"pull in\" their own map services to overlay onto a globe. Also planned is the addition of ESRI's MapStudio http:// www.mapstudio.com/, an ArcWeb Services application used by many daily newspapers to create maps for printing, to enable users to create customised maps [7] .",

As millions of people start \"playing\" with these new online \"gadgets\" or \"toys\" from Google and Microsoft, many of them will soon start thinking about becoming active participants, sharing information and collaborating online (notions that have been rightly associated with the Web for quite a long time), rather than just being satisfied with a passive information consumer/ viewer role. (The reader should note that it has been estimated that about 800 million persons are online today worldwide [11] .) However, although Google Maps API (and similar API offerings from other providers) enables users to deeply customize the standard provider's interface (Google Maps), and to create their own custom annotated maps (custom applications based on Google Maps), such APIs remain difficult for the non-expert, average user to exploit. This author expects the technology to further evolve to enable the average Web user to share geospatial informa-tion, to customize, annotate and publish his/her own online maps and related Web applications, and to collaborate with other users/online communities within an online customizable and collaborative mapping environment, all without the need for any prior programming knowledge or expertise.

Such developments are of interest to the geospatial community in that many geospatial data providers need to control or track who has access to their data and how the data are used. The lack of a GeoDRM capability has been identified as a major barrier to the broader adoption of Web-based geospatial technologies. The mission of OGC GeoDRM Working Group is to coordinate and mature the development and validation of work being done on digital rights management for the geospatial community [27] .",

Building on the powerful and universal visual language of geography, they succeeded in making their customizable multi-purpose maps and imagery of the world familiar and accessible to millions of ordinary Web users around the globe from outside the fields of specialized geosciences. Although ESRI have announced their planned response to Google (and MSN), it remains to be seen how their envisaged plans will materialize and compare to the offerings from Google and MSN, and also how Google and MSN mapping tools will further evolve in the near future.",
