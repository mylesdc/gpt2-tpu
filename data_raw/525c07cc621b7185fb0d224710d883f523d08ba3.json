            "text": "Background: Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) are a common cause of respiratory illnesses and are responsible for considerable morbidity and hospitalization across all age groups especially in individuals with compromised immunity. There are six known species of HCoV: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and SARS-HCoV. Although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of HCoVs, there is limited information on their presence and distribution in Kenya. Methods: HCoV strains that circulated in Kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized. A total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between January 2009 and December 2012 from around Kenya were analyzed by a real time RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers. HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of LL-CMK2 cells. The isolated viruses were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase (pol) gene. Results: The prevalence of HCoV infection was as follows: out of the 417 specimens, 35 (8.4 %) were positive for HCoV, comprising 10 (2.4 %) HCoV-NL63, 12 (2.9 %) HCoV-OC43, 9 (2.1 %) HCoV-HKU1, and 4 (1 %) HCoV-229E. The Kenyan HCoV strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains. Evolution analysis showed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three HCoV-HKU1, five HCoV-NL63, eight HCoV-OC43 and three HCoV-229E. Conclusions: There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya. This paper reports on the first molecular characterization of human Coronaviruses in Kenya, which play an important role in causing acute respiratory infections among children.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a linear, nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 27-32 kb [1] . They are round and sometimes pleiomorphic virions of approximately 80-120 nm in diameter. Their genome is the largest of all RNA viruses [2, 3] . Coronaviruses share features of genome organization and replication strategy, but have different virion morphology and genome lengths. The 20 kb polymerase (pol) gene, which covers the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b [1] . ORF 1b hosts the most highly conserved genomic sequences, encoding conserved functions such as polymerase and helicase activity [4] . These functions combined with similarities in replication and expression strategies, exhibit an evolutionary link among coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and toroviruses, thus forming the rationale for placing these viruses in the order Nidovirales [1] . Therefore, the highly conserved structure and function of viral polymerases make the pol a logical region for making phylogenetic comparisons.",

Coronaviruses are classified into four distinct phylogenetic groups. Whereas alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses infect mammals, deltacoronaviruses infect avian species [6] . All known human coronaviruses (HCoV) belong to the alphacoronavirus and betacoronaviruses. HCoV cause 30 % of common colds as well as severe infections in infants, children, and immunocompromised persons and the elderly [7] . HCoVs have a worldwide circulation, with reports published in populations of different countries such as Saudi Arabia [8] , France [9] , Kenya [10] and China [11] among others. However in 2012, a novel betacoronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated in Jeddah from a patient who was suffering from pneumonia and later died [8] . This MERS-CoV continues to cause fatal severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in various parts of the world, especially in the Middle East. As of February 2015, the World Health Organization had reported 971 laboratory confirmed cases with 356 deaths [12] . In light of the finding of this previously unknown coronavirus, it is probable that coronaviruses, other than those recognized to date, may be circulating in human populations in Kenya. As human coronaviruses are not routinely analyzed in Kenya, this study sought to identify and characterize HCoV strains circulating in different parts of Kenya and thus provide a knowledge base for epidemiological importance of human coronaviruses.",

This finding echoes previous studies in Kenya [26] and globally where HCoVs were identified as significant etiological agents of ILI and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) [9, 23] . HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly observed HCoV and this agrees with many previous studies that have reported HCoV-OC43 The Kenyan HCoV sequences are in blue color, the prototype strains are in red and representative strains in black; each sequence is represented by the GenBank accession number. The PEDV in green was used as an out-group. The tree was constructed by Mr. Bayes v3.2, using the general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model. Posterior probability support values are shown as percentages at the nodes predominance [27] . HCoV-NL63 contributed to 2 % of ILI cases in our study period. This finding echoes the findings in South Africa by Smuts, [28] where they showed that HCoV-NL63, contributed to 2.4 % of ILI cases in the period of one and a half years. HCoV-229E contributed to 1 % of ILI cases in the study period, echoing results from other studies worldwide that show low detection of this HCoV [27] . This is comparable to what has been observed globally, where HCoV activity is sporadic throughout the year with no obvious distinct seasonality [29] . Overall, the symptoms associated with coronavirus infection were similar to what has been reported elsewhere [1, 7, 24] and it was difficult to distinguish an infection involving HCoV using symptoms alone. This justifies the WHO classification of respiratory viral infections into influenza-like-illnesses without clear distinction of a specific respiratory virus infection based on symptoms alone. Out of 35 PCR-positive cases for HCoV, only 12 (34 %) yielded virus in LLCMK2 [30] and were confirmed by PCR. This was expected because molecular assays including PCR are more sensitive and specific at detecting pathogens [31, 32] than cell culture or serology. The low isolation rate may be attributed to low viral loads in the patients or the presence of inactivated viruses, potentially due to poor specimen handling and/ or storage. Nonetheless, this finding agrees with reports of poor growth and a lack of cytopathic effect in cell cultures by HCoVs [33] .",

Only a portion of the virus genome was analyzed and the evolution rates based on this small portion of the genome may be misleading. These shortcomings notwithstanding, it was demonstrated that four HCoV subtype strains were in circulation in Kenya from 2009 to 2012 and were similar to those circulating in other countries. However, sustained respiratory virus surveillance is necessary to monitor introductions of any of these dangerous species. Furthermore, full genome studies are required to provide comprehensive insight into the genetics and evolutionary characteristics of HCoVs in Kenya.",
