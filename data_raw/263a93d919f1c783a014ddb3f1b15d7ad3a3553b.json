The largest of the SARS-CoV accessory protein open reading frames (SARS 3a) oligomerizes, dynamically inserting into late endosomal, lysosomal, and trans-Golgi-network membranes. While previously implicated in a non-inflammatory apoptotic cell death pathway, here we extend the range of SARS 3a pathophysiologic targets by examining its effects on necrotic cell death pathways. We show that SARS 3a interacts with Receptor Interacting Protein 3 (Rip3), which augments the oligomerization of SARS 3a helping drive necrotic cell death. In addition, by inserting into lysosomal membranes SARS 3a triggers lysosomal damage and dysfunction. Consequently, Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) translocates to the nucleus increasing the transcription of autophagyand lysosome-related genes. Finally, SARS 3a activates caspase-1 either directly or via an enhanced potassium efflux, which triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. In summary, Rip3-mediated oligomerization of SARS 3a causes necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage, and caspase-1 activation-all likely contributing to the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV infection.",

The recent emergence of a SARS-like CoV called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus has underscored the need to understand the mechanisms behind CoV pathogenicity 2 . SARS presents with flu-like symptoms that can progress to respiratory failure secondary to immunopathologic injury 3, 4 . Pathologic examination of lung tissue from fatal cases shows diffuse alveolar damage, significant monocyte-macrophage infiltration, and elevated serum cytokines 3, 5, 6 . A study in mouse models highlighted the importance of inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) in SARS pathogenesis 7 , as high initial viral titer along with delayed type I interferon induction results in the recruitment and aberrant activation of IMMs. Deletion of the interferon receptor or IMMs rescued pathologic elevation of these cytokines post-infection and prevented lethal infection in mouse models, underscoring that patient death is likely due to a combination of an aberrant innate immune response and direct cytopathic effects of the virus 7 .",

The SARS-CoV genome encodes eight accessory proteins designated open reading frame (ORF)-3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b 8 . Several ORF functions have been identified: ORF-7a activates NF-\u03baB; 9 ORF3b upregulates the expression of several cytokines and chemokines; 10, 11 ORF-6 reduces IFN production; 12 ORF-8a triggers cellular apoptosis; 13 and ORF-8b reduces viral replication 14 . ORF-9b targets the MAVS signalosome to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6, severely limiting the host cell IFN response 15 . However, in apparent contradiction with the severe inflammatory phenotype important in SARS pathogenesis, the SARS-CoV accessory proteins thus far have primarily been implicated in apoptotic (noninflammatory) cell death. Cells undergoing apoptosis show morphological apoptotic hallmarks of cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation 16 , which limits the inflammatory response by neatly containing dying cells for clearance by macrophages 17, 18 . Necrotic cell death is inflammatory in nature due to the release of intracellular contents and is morphologically characterized by a gain in cell volume, organelle swelling, and plasma membrane rupture 18, 19 .",

Necroptosis is a caspase-independent form of programmed necrosis mediated by the Rip1-Rip3-MLKL signaling axis. Activated Rip3 phosphorylates MLKL, inducing its oligomerization, membrane insertion, and pore formation 20 . Pyroptosis is another form of inflammatory cell death following inflammasome activation; it allows the release of proinflammatory damage associated molecular patterns 21 . Inflammasome activation occurs when pathogenic molecules or cell stress activates the inflammasome sensor proteins, which then form a multimeric complex that directly activates caspase-1, allowing the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to its mature form 22 . Activated caspase-1 also cleaves the effector molecule Gasdermin D, which oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores 23 . Importantly, both forms of inflammatory cell death share a similar final effector step, namely the insertion of an oligomerized protein with channel functionality into the plasma membrane.",

SARS 3a has three transmembrane segments, allowing it to form a potassium-sensitive channel when oligomerized 24 . Based on the shared ability of MLKL and SARS 3a to oligomerize and insert into membranes, we addressed whether Rip3 could target SARS 3a to drive necrotic cell death. To assay necrotic cell death, we concomitantly monitored cellular ATP (which is depleted during death) and the release of cytosolic proteases (which increases with necrosis) 27 . To parse out contributions from components of the necroptotic pathway, we used 293T and HeLa cells in parallel, as 293T cells do not express endogenous Rip3 or MLKL, while HeLa cells express MLKL but not Rip3 28 . Overexpression of SARS 3a in 293T or HeLa cells alone did not cause significant ATP depletion or the release of cellular proteases. Similarly, expression of Rip3 in 293T cells expectedly did not cause necrotic cell death due to the lack of necroptosis effector MLKL. However, co-expression of SARS 3a and Rip3 caused substantial necrotic death that was unaffected by the addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting Rip3 helps SARS 3a cause necrotic death in a caspaseindependent manner (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure 1 ). To directly observe cell death, we transfected Rip3-mCherry into HeLa cells expressing SARS 3a-GFP and recorded the cell death process by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The images show that expression of Rip3 drives cell death in the presence of SARS 3a. As a control, a neighboring cell which did not express SARS 3a and Rip3 was captured and clearly survives the duration of imaging (Fig. 1b, video 1) . The above functional results encouraged us to determine if SARS 3a and Rip3 interact by immunoprecipitation. After expression of SARS 3a-flag and Rip3-Myc in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated SARS 3a-flag pulls down Rip3-Myc, whereas SARS 3a and Rip3-Myc cannot be detected from immunoprecipitation using mock antibody beads (Fig. 1c) . Mapping of the interaction between Rip3 and SARS 3a showed that the kinase domain of Rip3 (1-326) interacted with SARS 3a, but that the RHIM motif containing C-terminus (327-518) interacted very weakly (Fig. 1d) .",

Rip3 is suppressed in most cancer cell lines by DNA methylation, and treatment with hypomethylating agents such as 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-AD) induces Rip3 expression and sensitizes these cells to necroptosis inducing stimuli 30 . Previous reports have shown that the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 is resistant to the traditional necroptotic stimulus (TNF-\u03b1 + caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK + Smac-mimetic BV6), and that treatment with 5-AD induces endogenous Rip3 expression 30 . To validate this system, we first treated A459 cells with 5-AD or DMSO, followed by immunoblotting for Rip3. As expected, Rip3 was undetectable in the DMSO-treated cells, but clearly induced by 5-AD (Fig. 4a) . Consistently, DMSO-treated cells showed very little cell death after TNF-\u03b1 + Z-VAD-FMK + Smacmimetic treatment as assayed by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, red color) staining, while 5-AD treated cells under the same conditions showed significant cell death (~50%) (Fig. 4b) . We next transfected DMSO-or 5-ADtreated A549 cells with GFP-vector, SARS 3a-GFP, or SARS 3a C133A-GFP and imaged them live after 7-AAD staining. In the DMSO-treated cells, transfection of SARS 3a-GFP or its mutant did not induce cell death to a greater extent than the control. However, transfection of SARS 3a-GFP induced significant cell death in 5-ADtreated cells, while cell death was reduced almost to basal levels in SARS 3a C133A-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4c , d). Taken together, these data suggest that SARS 3a does not induce cell death in the absence of Rip3, but induces significant oligomerization-dependent death in the presence of endogenous Rip3.",

Confocal imaging showed that co-expressed SARS 3a and Rip3 co-localize with LAMP1, but that Rip3 only minimally localizes to the lysosome without SARS 3a (Fig. 5a) . Consistently, quantification of colocalization between Rip3 and LAMP1 by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) showed an increase from 0.153 basally to 0.435 after co-transfection with SARS 3a (Fig. 5a) , indicating that SARS 3a likely targets Rip3 to lysosomes, SARS 3a alone localized with LAMP1 ( Fig. 5b ) (PCC = 0.330, 34% SARS 3a-GFP and 42% LAMP1-mCherry colocalizing). To test whether SARS 3a causes lysosome damage, we monitored Galectin 3, which forms puncta on the lysosome after lysosomal membrane permeabilization 31 . Co-transfection of RFP-Galectin 3 and SARS 3a-GFP showed significantly more Galectin-3 puncta per cell than the control GFP-vector (Fig. 6a, b) .

To validate that SARS 3a causes lysosomal damage, we assayed the lysosomal degradation capacity of SARS 3atransfected cells using DQ-BSA red dye, which fluoresces after activation by lysosomal proteases. Cells expressing SARS 3a-GFP had dramatically decreased DQ-BSA red stain compared with the GFP-vector control (Fig. 6d) , and intensity analysis from several images confirmed that SARS 3a-GFP-positive cells showed a significant decrease of the DQ-BSA stain (Fig. 6e) . Finally, to test whether lysosomal cathepsins were released into the cytoplasm from SARS 3a-damaged lysosomes, we transfected a cytoplasmic cathepsin substrate Bid and assayed Bid cleavage by immunoblot. Expression of SARS 3a induced cleavage of Bid, which was reversed by the addition of the cathepsin inhibitors E64D and pepstatin A (Fig. 6f) . These data indicate that SARS 3a causes lysosomal membrane permeablization and the release of cathepsins from lysosomes, resulting in impaired lysosomal degradation capacity.",

Under normal conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and sequestered in the cytoplasm. The phosphatase activity of calcineurin (PPP3CB) is essential in dephosphorylating TFEB to promote its nuclear translocation 35 . To address whether PPP3CB mediates SARS 3a-induced TFEB nuclear translocation, we used cyclosporine (a calcineurin inhibitor) and PPP3CB siRNA and found that both reduced SARS 3a-induced TFEB nuclear translocation (Fig. 7e, f) . We next checked whether SARS 3a mediated TFEB nuclear translocation-induced TFEB target gene expression. qRT-PCR of LAMP1 and p62 showed increased transcript levels compared to the vector, while the SARS 3a C133A mutant did not induce those genes (Fig. 7g) . Similarly, immunoblot analysis of LAMP1 and p62 confirmed increase in protein levels after SARS 3a transfection, but less induction after expression of the SARS 3a C133A mutant (Fig. 7h) .

Given the ability of SARS 3a to act as a potassium channel 24 , we tested whether SARS 3a triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome. Using an NLRP3 inflammasome reconstitution system in 293T cells, expression of SARS 3a induced approximately twice as much caspase-1 activation and mature IL-1\u03b2 formation than the control vector. To determine whether SARS 3a functioned upstream of NEK7 (which is directly downstream of potassium efflux), we knocked down NEK7 in the presence of SARS 3a. Compared to transfection of SARS 3a with control shRNA, NEK7 knockdown resulted in reduced cleaved caspase-1 and less mature IL-1\u03b2, confirming that SARS 3a acts upstream to NEK7 (Fig. 8a) . We then transfected SARS 3a into Phorbol 12-myristate 13acetate (PMA) differentiated Thp-1 macrophages, and observed the release of endogenous cleaved caspase-1 in culture supernatant (Supplementary Figure 3) .",

We hypothesized that SARS 3a activates caspase-1 without NLRP3 and ASC. Consistenly, SARS 3a and its mutant produced more cleaved caspase-1 (2.04and 2.10-fold) and IL-1\u03b2 (1.37-and 1.55-fold) than basal even in the absence of NLRP3 and ASC (Fig. 8c ). Based on these results, we checked if SARS 3a interacts directly with caspase-1; our data show that while wild-type SARS 3a interacts with caspase-1, the SARS 3a oligomerizationdeficient mutant pulls down caspase-1 to a much greater degree (Fig. 8d) . This result suggests that monomeric SARS 3a may have a higher affinity for caspase-1, and that SARS 3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome both via potassium efflux mediated by SARS 3a oligomers and via direct caspase-1 targeting by SARS 3a monomers.",

On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that an abundance of necroptosis perpetuates pathogenic inflammation and drives tissue injury 40 . Rip3 deletion rescues the pathogenesis of several animal models of inflammatory disease, including pancreatitis 28,41 , atherosclerosis 42 , Gaucher's disease 43 , and morbidity after systemic TNF administration 44, 45 , suggesting that necroptosis induces tissue injury by augmenting inflammation after cell death.

While it would be reasonable to expect a reduction in necrotic cell death following Rip3 and SARS 3a co-expression, our cell death assays indicated the opposite. This phenomenon is mechanistically explained by the observation that Rip3 targets SARS 3a to induce its oligomerization, which facilitates SARS 3a membrane insertion and ion channel functionality 24 . We would briefly like to point out that it is possible the oligomers detected in this study are in fact single or multiple SARS 3a proteins in complex with another unknown protein, though it is clear that this complex is needed for cell death. Taken together, our data show that SARS 3a may act as an alternative death effector protein downstream of the Rip3 to induce necrotic death, in effect hijacking the cells necroptotic machinery to promote virus release and inflammatory cell death. As SARS-CoV infection in monocytes and macrophages is typically abortive 46, 47 , these data provide an alternative mechanism for host cell lysis, virus release, and cell death.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence shows the importance of IMMs in inducing the aberrant inflammatory state responsible for immunopathologic injury in fatal SARS cases. Infiltrating monocytes (Ly6C hi Cd11b + CCR2 + ) in SARS-CoVinfected mice have high levels of inflammatory markers (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and iNOS) 7 . IMMs typically have a proclivity for proinflammatory M1 macrophage differentiation and generate a robust cytokine response after exposure to infectious agents 49, 50 . Thus, our study keyed in on SARS 3a to gain molecular level insights into the host-pathogen interactions governing the proinflammatory programming of IMMs. Our data show that SARS 3a activates TFEB. The activation of TFEB may be significant as TFEB directly transcriptionally activates proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages (including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-27) and promotes a macrophage proinflammatory state 51, 52 . TFEB has also been implicated in the migration of macrophages in response to CCL2. CCL2 is a ligand for CCR2, which is expressed highly on SARS-CoV-infected IMMs 51 . Thus, activation of TFEB may contribute to the hypermigration and the inflammatory state of SARS-CoV-infected IMMs.",

            "text": "Finally, our data show that SARS 3a directly initiates the inflammatory cascade by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and contributing to pyroptotic death. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by K + efflux, which causes the kinase NEK7 to translocate to the mitochondrial membrane allowing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly 53 . SARS 3a oligomers likely activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via K + efflux, while SARS 3a monomers directly target and activate caspase-1 to cleave IL-1\u03b2. The ability of SARS 3a to generate IL-1\u03b2 is significant, as IL-1\u03b2 is an upstream initiator of the inflammatory cascade. It will be of interest to see whether SARS 3a monomers target and activate other caspases, and to determine the contribution of the proinflammatory pyroptotic cell death to SARS pathogenesis. More detailed experiments looking at the cleavage of the gasdermin D protein will be needed to get a better mechanistic understanding of the contribution of pyroptosis to host cell death, but these are quite relevant as both lung IMMs and lung epithelial cells express inflammasome components 54 .",

Though previous studies have shown that overexpression of SARS 3a alone can recapitulate these phenotypes, the overexpression nature of this study is a limitation that will require further live virus evaluation of the necroptotic pathway for validation. In summary, our data show that a single SARS accessory protein initiates multiple forms of cell death. More significantly, our data strongly link SARS 3a and the SARS-CoV to Rip3, a necroptotic protein whose inhibition has been shown to ameliorate a variety of inflammatory diseases causing tissue damage. This study supports additional research into the contributions of Rip3 and the necroptotic pathway to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, and may lay the foundation for a new targeted therapy for SARS or MERS patients.",
