The majority of patients with recurrent meningitis experienced two meningitis episodes, but we found 3 patients with 7, 11 and 40 recurrent episodes. Nineteen (50 %) patients in recurrent meningitis group and 90 (58 %) in non-recurrent group were men. Median age of patients with recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis was 29 versus 57 years (p < 0.001). Nine (24 %) patients with recurrent meningitis versus 64 (41 %) patients with non-recurrent meningitis had an underlying immunosuppressive condition (p = 0.02, OR:0.41, 95 % CI:0.18-0.92). The immunosuppression was: diabetes mellitus in 32 (44 %), alcoholism in 19 (26 %), endstage liver disease in 7 (9.5 %) and malignancy, malnutrition, pregnancy, splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy in 15 (20.5 %). We found dissemination of infection from a contiguous site in 74 (38 %) cases, bone defects and/or CSF leakage in 36 (18.5 %) cases and hematogenous spread in 14 (7.2 %) cases. A cranial bone discontinuity and/or CSF leakage were identified in recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis in 21 (55 %) versus 15 (10 %) episodes (p < 0.001, OR:14.41, 95 % CI:6.21-33.4). Hematogenous spread was observed only in the non-recurrent meningitis group. In recurrent versus nonrecurrent meningitis, impaired consciousness on admission was noted in 15 (40 %) versus 64 (41 %). We noted one death (2.6 %) among patients with recurrent PM group vs 42 (27 %) in the non-recurrent group (p<0.001, OR:0.07, 95 % CI:0.01-0.5). Death was associated with nonrecurrent meningitis (p < 0.001), contiguous spread (p = 0.014), immunodepression (p = 0.01) and impaired consciousness (p = 0.005).",

Background Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with Neisseria meningitidis, represent two of the most frequent causes of bacterial meningitis in adolescents and young adults. Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment of this condition may result in serious complications such as brain damage, hearing loss or even death. Case report We present the case of a 37 year old female, without any known medical condition, under no current medication, who was admitted in our clinic for fever, chills, fronto-occipital headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, symptoms which had been present for the last 36 hours with progressive enhancement. Upon physical examination she was febrile (38.3\u00b0C), sweating, no pulmonary crackles or cardiac murmurs, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse rate was 74 bpm, without hepatosplenomegaly, oriented to time and place but with signs of meningeal irritation (Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign, and nuchal rigidity). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, biological inflammatory syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, positive procalcitonin, negative HIV, HTLV serology, negative markers of viral hepatitis B or C, normal urinalysis, negative hemocultures, and sinus X-ray showed bilateral maxillary sinusitis. Lumbar puncture at the moment showed no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) modification: normal pressure, clear appearance, negative Pandy's reaction, 1 cell/\u03bcL, protein -31 mg/dL, glucose -57 mg/dL, chloride -700 mg/dL, negative CSF cultures. PCR using mass spectrometry (PLEX -ID) performed from CSF identified Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed minimal meningeal enhancement, with no other modifications. Given all this data (clinical appearance and identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae in CSF using PLEX-ID), we considered the case as bacterial meningitis at an early stage, with normal CSF. She received treatment with meropenem 2 g q8h, vancomycin 1 g q12h and dexamethasone for 14 days with very good clinical response. The lumbar puncture repeated after 10 days showed no change from the previous examination. The patient fully recovered with no sequelae. Conclusions Bacterial meningitis exhibiting apparently normal CSF parameters, even if uncommon, is a very well-recognized phenomenon. A lumbar puncture which shows no abnormalities in CSF cannot exclude bacterial meningitis in the early stage of the disease. Empiric antibiotic should be used when the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is strongly suspected even in the cases with normal CSF results. PCR technique represents a great tool in establishing the causative pathogen of meningitis, making possible the diagnosis of this condition even in the early stages when no changes in the CSF are noticeable.",

The lab reports showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute inflammatory syndrome, positive procalcitonin, hyperglycemia with high glycated hemoglobin level, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mobile mitral valve vegetation on the anterior leaflet, 10 mm in diameter, with normal ejection fraction. Two sets of blood cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Chest X-ray showed peripheral, bilateral, lower lobe infiltrative densities. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed suggestive images for small abscesses in the supratentorial region. Given this data, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis with multiple septic emboli (pulmonary, ocular, cerebral) was established. Antibiotic therapy with linezolid and rifampin was initiated, due to a very good multiple organ penetration. As musculoskeletal secondary determination (septic arthritis, thigh abscess) and linezolid hematological side effects (anemia) occurred, we switched therapy to oxacillin, amikacin and levofloxacin. The patient had a good clinical response, with a total course of antibiotic therapy of 6 weeks. He was referred to a cardiovascular surgeon for further monitoring. Conclusions Patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes have a higher risk of infections with endogenous microbes, with more severe outcomes. In our case, even if the MSSA strain isolated in hemocultures didn't represent a therapeutic challenge in terms of antibiotics options, it did develop into a severe and life threatening illness. This strain of MSSA possibly used all its energy in the synthesis of multiple virulence genes (adhesion, penetration, invasion) which determined numerous extra-cardiac complications of endocarditis.",

The predominant resistance gene was bla CTX-M either alone or in combination with the bla TEM gene, all present in E. coli. Sequence analysis of the 28 bla CTX-M genes found revealed that 18 strains were members of CTX-M group 1, and 10 were members of CTX-M group 9. Two different resistance genes were identified in 15 strains: bla CTX-M + bla TEM (13) and bla SHV + bla TEM (2) .

The patient's medical records emphasize a history of chronic suppurative otomastoiditis surgically treated twenty years before. From that moment forward, the patient presented numerous relapses (left ear pain, purulent otorrhea) accompanied by neurological involvement (left facial nerve peripheral palsy), for which local treatment and outpatient antibiotic therapy were conducted. Two years before admission, a tympanic-mastoid cavity with purulent discharge was clinically perceived. MRI confirmed the presence of an abscess in the left petrous part of the temporal bone. Successive evaluations were conducted through multidisciplinary approach, but the surgical intervention was delayed. On the current admission, blood and multiple samples were taken and a lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF aspect was highly suggestive of bacterial meningoencephalitis. The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics aimed at covering highly resistant bacteria. CSF cultures came back positive for Acinetobacter baumannii XDR (colistin sensitivity present). Following complex therapy, the clinical and biological profile improved. The neurological status became stable (GCS = 12-13), thus permitting surgical reintervention.

The first case is a young woman, pregnant in 24 weeks, under ETV for 4 years, with negative HBeAg and undetectable VL, who decided to stop therapy when she discovered the pregnancy. Six months later she was admitted in our clinic for important hepatocytolysis. The biological exams revealed: ALT > 20 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive HBeAg, HBV VL of 9 log IU/mL, normal prothrombin concentration and mild hyperbilirubinemia. The patient received off label lamivudine with slow decrease of ALT and VL of 2 log IU/mL at delivery. ETV therapy was reintroduced after delivery, with favorable outcome. The second case is a young man who discontinued ETV because he lost his medical insurance. During antiviral therapy he had normal ALT and undetectable VL. Five months later, he presented ALT 5xULN, jaundice and high VL. The patient renewed his insurance and ETV was reinitiated, with good outcome. The last patient, a 28 yearold man is still hospitalized. He was under ETV for 6 years with good biological outcome, after a previous therapy with peginterferon. In January 2016, he stopped ETV by himself and in August he was admitted in our clinic for jaundice and vomiting. The tests showed ALT 60xULN, hyperbilirubinemia (16 mg/dL), positive HBeAg and decrease of prothrombin concentration and fibrinogen. The therapy with tenofovir was immediately started and after 5 days, the prothrombin concentration became normal, but ALT and bilirubin remained increased. Conclusions NAs therapy must be continued until HBs seroconversion, even in patients who achieved undetectable VL. The risk of severe liver decompensation especially in young people is extremely high. In women with childbearing potential, ETV can be switched with tenofovir and the therapy must be continued during the entire pregnancy.

Nine patients (30 %) had high HCV-RNA viral loads (>600 000 IU/mL) at baseline. HCV-R was present in 30 % of cases, after a mean of 4 months (range: 3-12 months) from enrolling. A hepatic flare was associated only in 3 of these cases. Three (10 %) patients died, one due to HCV associated fulminant hepatitis and two due to HM complications.The median HCV viral load at baseline was 507525.00 IU/mL (IQR = 3074957 IU/mL) in HCV-R patients versus 471129.00 IU/mL (IQR = 1562720 IU/mL) in patients without HCV-R. Neither sex (p = 0.23), age (p = 0.13), HCV-RNA levels at baseline (p = 1), presence of fibrosis (p = 1), necroinflammatory activity or HM type significantly influenced the risk of HCV-R.",

The MRI reveals no alterations that could explain the neurological deficit, the lumbar puncture is within normal limits. The patient had a favorable biological trend with the correction of coagulation disorders and improvement of sepsis markers. The second lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation. The findings of motor nerve conduction studies showed markedly reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials and suggested demyelinating polyneuropathy.

However, there is a challenge when the patient presents with other diseases and treatment must be adapted carefully, especially when dealing with a patient that has both HIV infection and hepatitis C virus. Case report Herein we describe a case of a 35-year-old Caucasian male, with a personal history of psoriasis vulgaris with the onset at the age of 20. The patient received treatment with fumaric acid esters for 4 weeks in Germany, with a favorable clinical response, but due to financial issues the treatment was discontinued. He was admitted to our dermatology department for the assessment of a generalized skin eruption involving the trunk, buttocks, arms, feet and the scalp, characterized by pruritic, sharply demarcated erythematous plaques, covered by silvery scale with a tendency to develop erythoderma and inverse psoriasis. The fingernails were affected and also the distal interphalangeal joints. The patient was also tested for HIV, viral hepatitis and syphilis. The results showed the presence of HIV infection and hepatitis C. As far as treatment was concerned during the hospitalization, topical therapy was applied including emollients, keratolytics and potent corticoids with a good clinical outcome. Due to the laboratory findings, the patient was referred to the infectious disease specialist in order to continue the investigations and start treating the HIV infection and viral hepatitis C. Moderate to severe cases can be treated with topical therapy, phototherapy as a first line and as a second line oral retinoids can be an option with careful monitoring for potential adverse events. More refractory and severe disease can be treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors. The positive role of the highly active antiretroviral therapy was observed because it led to the improvement of the psoriasis in our patient too. Conclusions HIV associated psoriasis is often refractory to traditional therapies, but when the patient has also hepatitis C virus, treatment is even more challenging as it requires careful consideration. The particularity of this case is represented by the fact that the patient was not tested for HIV infection before being treated with fumaric acid esters. The generalized psoriasis eruption in a young patient should lead to more investigations including HIV testing.

The ability of the host to produce an early antigangliosidic response might be seen as a defense mechanism directed to the elimination of a danger signal. Background Since its discovery in 1983, HIV-1 has become the most extensively studied pathogen in history. Antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the quality and the lifespan of people living with HIV. Despite achieving viral suppression many of the HIV infected patients may still harbor persistent low levels of inflammation that may contribute to premature aging and cardiovascular comorbidities. Our objective was to evaluate subclinical chronic inflammation in a cohort of persons living with HIV who were undergoing ART, based on persistent viral replication. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of Caucasian HIV-1 patients attending the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\", Bucharest, Romania. All included patients were under ART for at least 6 months. Blood samples were tested for: HIV viral load, CD4 cells count, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in all patients. We evaluated inflammatory markers comparatively between two groups: undetectable patients (with HIV viral loads below the level of detectiongroup 1) and HIV patients with persistent replication (group 2). Independent samples T-test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used for assessing statistical differences between groups. Results Sixty patients with a mean age of 33.2 (\u00b113.7 years) were included in the study -60 % were males. The mean time on ART was 80 (\u00b147.8 months). Most patients (71.7 %) had serum HIV loads below the limit of detection (group 1). Mean CD4 counts were 522 (\u00b1272.9 cells/cmm) for the entire cohort and 565.4 (\u00b1268.3 cells/cmm) in group 1 and 414.2 (\u00b1261.2 cells/cmm) in group 2. Median CRP values were 1.79 (IQR = 4.6) mg/L in group 1, compared to 2.57 (IQR = 7.6) mg/L in patients with detectable viremia (without statistical significance, p = 0.92). Mean IL-6 values were 37.2 (\u00b160.7) pg/mL for group 1 vs 66 (\u00b115.5) pg/mL in group 2 (with the level of statistical significance close to the cut-off value, p = 0.06). TNF-alpha mean values were 20 (\u00b114.4) pg/mL in detectable patients (group 2) compared to 16.6 (\u00b117.5) pg/mL in group 2 (p = 0.48).",

The clinical exam revealed high fever, dyspnea on mild exertion and tachycardia. The lab tests showed intense acute inflammatory syndrome, leukocytosis with lymphocytosis, normochromic-normocytic anemia, moderate cytolysis, high value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (3161 pg/mL) and high antibody titer for Echovirus 30. A chest X-ray showed lesions suggestive for right medial lobe pneumonia, while the cardiology consult with echocardiography diagnosed myocarditis and pericarditis, with an ejection fraction of 40 %. Given the critical state of the patient a bronchoscopy could not be performed at that time point. Before receiving the positive serology for Echovirus 30, his clinical state continued to deteriorate despite adequate cardiologic and antibiotic therapy (levofloxacin and ertapenem), so high-dose corticotherapy (24 milligrams of dexamethasone per day for 3 weeks) was added, with slow improvement of both clinical and biological parameters. After two months of apparently good health, he presented to the hospital for the same clinical and biological findings, but having stable cardiac function. The CT-scan revealed alveolar condensation in the right medial lobe and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was suggestive for lymphocytic alveolitis. The repeated high dose corticotherapy lead to a slow but steady improvement. All autoimmune markers were negative, and cultures from both sputum and bronchoalveolar fluid were negative for bacteria and fungi. Conclusions After ruling out bacterial and immunological etiologies two times in a row, echovirus 30 remained the incriminated infectious agent of both lymphocytic alveolitis and cardiac complications. While literature data shows that severe enterovirus infections are mostly illustrated by aseptic meningitis, our case reveals how an echovirus 30 infection can be responsible for severe cardiac complications (myocarditis and pericarditis), but also for recurrent lymphocytic alveolitis, both in the same patient.

Based on clinical data in conjunction with the results of biological samples and laboratory investigations, the diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis is established and the patient is transferred to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases for therapeutic and clinical monitoring. Physical examination at admission to our clinic reveals: afebrile patient with moderate influenced general state, temporo-spatial disorientation, but without meningeal signs, tongue with whitish deposits, cardio-pulmonary and digestive systems with no pathological sings.

Case report We present the case of a 10 year old girl, diagnosed 7 days prior with varicella, without any significant medical history, admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" for lower back pain, myalgias, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking. The onset of the symptoms was 3 days prior with an evolution towards exacerbation. Clinical exam upon admission confirmed varicella and furthermore, urinary retention with enlarged bladder, diminished patellar, right plantar clonus, decrease in muscle strength, myalgias, and paresthesias, coordination impairment in the lower limbs and asymmetric paraparesis predominantly on the right side. Workup was within the normal range. Myelitis was suspected and therefore a MRI of the head and spine was performed, which showed medullar inflammatory lesions in the cervicothoracic segment. Lumbar puncture was normal, except for a positive varicella-zoster virus PCR from CSF. Positive diagnosis consisted of cervicothoracic varicella-zoster virus myelitis. Treatment with acyclovir (60 mg/ kg/day), ceftriaxone 2 g/day, corticotherapy with methylprednisolone, human immunoglobulin, and iv fluids was promptly instituted for 14 days, with a slow favorable evolution. Paresthesias, motor deficit, urinary retention and sensitivity impairment resolved under treatment.",

Background Combined antiretroviral therapy significantly improved the prognosis and the life expectancy of HIV patients. Along with this, the profile of HIV associated malignant pathologies has changed. Among them, lymphoma, having a higher incidence and a poorer prognosis than in general population, is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in HIV infected people. Case report We present two cases of HIV-associated lymphoma with different outcome. In the first case, a newly HIV diagnosed patient, with a good immunological status (lymphocytes CD4 count 442/cmm, HIV-RNA = 193502 copies/mL), developed non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and he had a fulminant evolution towards death. In the second case, a patient known for over twenty years with HIV infection and who had discordant immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy (lymphocytes CD4 count 19/cmm, undetectable HIV-RNA), was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and he had a favorable evolution with chemotherapy. Both patients presented with systemic extranodal involvement, B symptoms and were classified in stage IV lymphoma. The extranodal involvement included central nervous system and liver in the case of the patient with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt-type lymphoma and liver and spleen involvement in the case of patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both patients required exhaustive medical investigations and a close interdisciplinary cooperation during the entire time of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Conclusions HIV-associated lymphoma manifests in various forms in clinical settings. Unlike in general population, HIV-associated lymphoma is usually more aggressive and has a poor prognostic. Therefore it must be included into the differential diagnosis panel in patients presenting with sudden increase in lymph nodes, neurological manifestation and abrupt decrease in CD4 lymphocytes count. HIV-associated lymphoma differential diagnosis involves a wide panel of infectious and oncologic pathologies, therefore extensive investigation and the implication of specialists from various medical fields are required. A fast and accurate diagnosis may warrant the future evolution of the patients.

Background Among immunocompetent hosts the enteroviral infections are most frequently benign and auto-limited illnesses. Exceptionally these summer viral pathologies can evolve dramatically, presenting under severe forms of disease, with important associated complications sometimes leading to death. In the present paper we present the clinical evolution of an acute Coxsackie virus infection in an immunocompetent child, complicated by pancytopenia. Case report A young baby girl, 11 months of age, without any particular pathologic medical history is submitted in the 9 th Pediatric Department at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" for fever, poor feeding, sleepiness and diarrhea. The clinical onset, registered 48 hours before her hospital submission was characterized by fever and poor feeding. The initial clinical evolution found a moderately ill appearing child, with pallor identified, without associated petechiae or bruising and without any other particular exanthematous elements, with a stable cardio-circulatory status, with no clinical signs of renal function impairment, diarrheal stools emitted, no nuchal rigidity or neurological focal signs present. The laboratory investigations isolated a franc pancytopenia (NL = 1.600/cmm, Hb = 8.8 g/dL, PLT = 105.000/cmm), with no other pathological findings. The serological screening for HIV, HTLV, adenovirus, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Influenza came back negative, with a normal peripheral smear and bone marrow aspiration. No clinical relevant result was communicated by the microbiological laboratory (negative hemocultures, nasal and pharyngeal swabs, uroculture and stool cultures). A positive IgM serology for Coxsackie virus was obtained. Cortisone, i.v. immunoglobulin, endovenous hydration and supportive therapy were initiated, with subsequent favorable evolution, with rapid normalization of the hemogram parameters (a discrete hypochromic anemia persists at a level previously identified in the infant) and clinical restoration.",

Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver, the overall incidence of approximately 626,000 cases annually, with predominance in males. HCC is considered the third leading cause of death from malignancy and the second leading cause of death respectively in the field of digestive cancers. These patients are 80 % previously diagnosed with hepatitis B or C. The incidence of HCC in patients diagnosed with cirrhosis of viral B and C etiology is increasing, overall survival at 5 years continues to remain below 10 % due on the one hand to the discovery of tumors in advanced stages, ineffective screening in patients with risk factors for HCC and on the other hand to the lack of curative therapies applicable to this category of patients. Curative or palliative treatment of HCC depends mainly on local tumor extension and preexisting liver disease. Angiogenic agents of the type Sorafenib may cause an increase in overall survival by 44 % compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. Case report We present the case of a of 47 years old male, known with cirrhosis of viral etiology B from 2003, consumer of ethanol, who refused antiviral therapy with entecavir in 2009 and was diagnosed in February 2016 with HCC with extrahepatic extension. The patient was admitted in January 2016 at the Suceava Emergency Hospital with jaundice, fever, right upper quadrant pain, loss of appetite, weight loss. Clinical exam: patient with intense jaundice, emaciated, superficial lymph impalpable, ascites fluid quantity average, slightly sensitive right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings: significant hepatic cytolysis, cholestasis, elevated amylase, alpha-fetoprotein slightly elevated, thrombocytopenia, moderate inflammatory syndrome. CT and MRI exam revealed a nodular lesion in segment VI/VII with extra capsular extension and diaphragm and chest wall invasion. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry outlined trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma developed on a background of chronic active hepatitis advanced fibrosis. The patient has no indication for liver transplantation and liver resection, but could benefit from treatment with Sorafenib. The patient devloped important ascites, right massive pleurisy, hepatic encephalopathy phenomena and died 6 months after the diagnosis of HCC and one month after starting treatment with Sorafenib. Conclusions Current medical treatments are less effective in advanced HCC, and their role after liver transplantation, liver resection, should be explored further. Current hopes are turning to new molecular \"target\" therapies that explore the biological pathways involved in carcinogenesis signaling in the liver.

Background Influenza seasons represent a major strain on the health care system and they can vary in their severity, timing and duration from one season to another. Most of patients the infected with A H1N1 influenza virus exhibit no symptoms or very mild respiratory symptoms and high fever. In some cases, regardless of age or comorbidities, severe disease and complications due to infection, including death, may occur. Our case series study is meant to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and paraclinical characteristics of patients infected with type A H1N1 Influenza virus, admitted in the Intensive Care Department of INBI \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" in the 2015-2016 influenza season. Methods A retrospective, observational case series study was conducted over a 6-month period, on 21 adult patients admitted in the Intensive Care Department, that have been confirmed with severe influenza infection through nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal secretion PCR analysis. In the same time, we collected data on demographics and comorbidities. Clinical data, microbiological samples and imagistics were extracted from patients' medical charts through thorough analysis. Eventually, therapeutic measures were statistically correlated with the outcome.",

Background Right-sided infectious endocarditis (IE) is a common condition in IV drug users (IVDU), Staphylococcus spp. being the most involved pathogen. Many IVDU are HIV positive, condition making them extremely susceptible to infections. Our aim is to present the challenges raised by the management of IE in an HIV positive IVDU. Case report A 27-year-old former IVDU, currently under methadone substitution, with HCV chronic infection, HIV infection (naive to treatment), was admitted into the hospital for fever (38.3\u00b0C), dyspnea on minimal exertion (SaO 2 = 87 % spontaneous), cough, generalized arthromyalgia, temporal-spatial disorientation. Taking into account the HIV status correlated with the severe general presentation and important lymphopenia, the patient had inserted a left jugular central venous line (CVL) for easier administration of medication, blood cultures were taken, and he was started on maximal antimicrobial therapy associated with dexamethasone and mannitol to treat a potential meningitis (later ruled out by lumbar puncture). The drug abuse history, the continuously deteriorating state urged for a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) that revealed 3 vegetations located on the tricuspid valve, evocative for IE. Therapy was adapted for a possible staphylococcal endocarditis (vancomycin IV 2 g q12h 3 days, and gentamycin IV 200 mg single dose 2 days), with diuretic and beta-blocker drugs. A few days later one blood culture came out positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). The diagnosis was IE with MSSA on tricuspid valve (revised Duke criteria: 1 major criterion -vegetations seen on TTE, 3 minor criteria: predisposing factors, one positive blood culture and fever), the antibiotherapy was changed again to oxacillin IV 12 g per day (7 days). Despite the correct treatment, the patient's evolution worsened (low fever, intense dyspnea, increased biologic inflammatory syndrome, pulmonary rales), the chest radiography was consistent with pneumonia, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, tuberculosis was excluded, but MSSA was confirmed (probable septic emboli). Blood cultures were taken from the CVL, and one was positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (the new finding was interpreted as a nosocomial infection due to the patient's poor adherence to the hygienic procedure involving the CVL). Linezolid was used for 2 weeks, and then oxacillin was resumed, completing a 6 week successful antibiotherapy.",

Background Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation, infections, neoplasms and autoimmune diseases. Its biological activity is exerted through two mechanisms which involve the binding of IL-6 to a specific membrane receptor, abbreviated as IL-6R (classic signaling pathway) or the binding of IL-6 to the soluble form of the receptor, abbreviated as sIL-6R (trans signaling pathway); this step is followed by the interaction between the previously formed complex and the transducer subunit (gp 130).

Conclusions IL-6 is secreted in response to viral infections and malignant transformation. The sIL-6R subunit is overexpressed in viral infections. Soluble glycoprotein 130 is synthesized in small amounts in the studied viral infections. Therefore IL-6 may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses of the human body through many mechanisms. In viral infections IL-6 trans signaling pathway is overexpressed. Knowledge of intracellular signaling mechanisms of IL-6 has important consequences on the therapeutic strategies which are aimed at blocking the activity of this cytokine. ",

In cases with persistent HBsAg the dynamic development of humoral syndromes is categorically different compared to the evolution of hepatitis with the same syndromes in cases of acute infection evolving with HBsAg negativity.",

Case report A 74 years old patient coming from the rural area, with a history of penile tumor with lymph nodes expansion (2008), operated on, diabetic and coronary patient, under treatment with Trombex for one year, is hospitalized accusing fever, dysuria, cloudy urine. Objective, without modifications on admission, paraclinically only a prostate hypertrophy is retained on ultrasound. Initially interpreted as urinary infection, therapy with ciprofloxacin is started after urine culture is collected. On the day of admission, the patient falls from his own height while going to the bathroom, without apparent trauma, without loss of consciousness. On the second day from admission, the patient accuses right lower back and right lower leg pain, without objective cutaneous modifications. The third day the pain centralizes on the right lower leg, with gradual evolution towards posterior edema, with positive Hoffman sign. The situation is interpreted as being deep vein thrombosis and, therefore, anticoagulant therapy is initiated. After three days of treatment the patient is afebrile, still presenting edema and pain in the calf, neutrophilic leukocytosis appears, inflammatory evidence increases, metabolic imbalance is present, urine culture is sterile. The treatment is changed to ceftriaxone. The ultrasound of the right lower leg section shows a fluid collection of 15/3.5 cm. Puncture is performed in the area of the collection but nothing externalizes. A vascular surgery consultation in Timi\u0219oara refutes the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis thus maintaining the suspicion of possibly infectious hematoma. The patient is transferred to the surgery ward where the suspicion is confirmed surgically and the collection is evacuated.

Background More than 15 million individuals are infected by the T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) through the world, the first described human oncovirus. Etiologically linked to the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), the spread of the virus is endemic in Japan, Africa, Central and South America but little is known about the infection rates in Romania, where testing of blood-donors in the only structured epidemiologic ongoing program regarding the HTLV infection. Starting from the direct mutagenic effects of the virus, the present paper wants to raise awareness towards this endemic problem we are facing. Methods Under high clinical suspicion, the ATLL diagnosis was established in the Hematology department of the Clinical Hospital Colentina -Bucharest, from January 2014 to March 2016, by analyzing the lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, histology of the tissues affected in the pure lymphoma forms. The HTLV-1/2-specific antibodies were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were confirmed by real-time PCR assay. For the confirmed cases we prospectively recorded the age, sex, immune status, the form and the severity of the disease, the response to the first, and if applied, to the second line of chemotherapy, in some instances in association with antiretroviral therapy. The epidemiological link to a possible HTLV infection source was explored using a standard questionnaire.",

The clinical presentation is polymorphic and nonspecific, but most often characterized by: self-limited influenza-like illness, pneumonia or hepatitis. On the other hand, there are other clinical forms, which are less frequent like: cardiovascular, neurologic, obstetric manifestations and dermatologic (5-20 %) in the form of erythema nodosum or other nonspecific exanthemas, maculopapular rash or diffuse punctiform pruritic rash. Case report We report the case of a 53 year old Caucasian female, consumer of raw milk, who presented for clinical and diagnostic reevaluation of a persistent fever. Initially, the case was diagnosed as an acute acalculous cholecystitis (cholestatic syndrome associated with hepatic cytolysis and thick gallbladder wall at CT) and treated with ertapenem and ciprofloxacin, under which the patient became afebrile, but the fever reappeared as soon as she left the hospital. At the time of admission in our clinic, the case was considered as an angiocholitis and treated initially with ampicillin/sulbactam, but after 48 h we escalated to piperacillin/ tazobactam and doxycycline and then to meropenem and doxycycline (9 days of meropenem and 5 days of doxycycline) because the patient presented relapsing fever under treatment (maximum 39\u00b0C). At day 6 of hospitalization, the patient developed erythematous, indurated nodules, not sharply marginated, with 2-3 cm in diameter, located on the anterior lower legs. Investigations were extended for finding the etiology of this new manifestation, diagnosed after the histopathologic examination as erythema nodosum. We excluded: pulmonary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, streptococcal, Yersinia, Salmonella and Mycoplasma infections, cholangiocarcinoma, genital cancer. The only positive finding was positive IgM antibodies for Coxiella burnetii. We reintroduced doxycycline, despite lack of response at the beginning of hospitalization and soon after that the fever remitted. Repeating the Coxiella serology we still found high antibodies titer and the favorable evolution of erythema nodosum under doxycycline pleaded for the diagnosis of Q fever. Moreover, it is important to mention that the patient forgot to take her treatment for 1 day, which determined the apparition of new nodules. The evolution of these new lesions was favorable, a compatible aspect of a therapeutic confirmation of the diagnosis, which confirmed once more the efficacy of our management.",

Background Granulicatella species are nutritionally variant streptococci. They are a normal component of the oral flora, but have been associated with a variety of invasive infections in humans, especially bacterial endocarditis or abdominal abscesses. Recently, Granulicatella elegans was isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) as well. CNS involvement has to be early recognized since Granulicatella infections have an increased morbidity and mortality as well as great bacteriologic failure and relapse rates. Case report We present a case of a 53 years-old woman with meningitis, first considered to be tuberculosis (TB). She received antiTB treatment, including streptomycin. Seven days after treatment initiation, the general condition improved, but the patient experienced bilateral deafness as well as severe disequilibrium, documented by pure tone audiometry and vestibular investigations (posturography, videonystagmography and video head impulse test -HIT). These permanent sensorial deficits have a huge negative impact on quality of lifepatient cannot communicate anymore, walk alone or perform daily activities. Together with appropriate new antibiotic treatment for Granulicatella infection, hearing aid and vestibular rehabilitation program were recommended. Very few cases of Granulicatella meningitis are reported and none with hearing and equilibrium deficit secondary to this infection. We consider this case as a cochleo-vestibular bilateral deficit secondary to meningitis more than to ototoxic treatment, since in the majority of adult cases with ototoxic lesions, aminoglycosides affects only one of the sensorial structures from the inner earhearing sensory epithelium or vestibular one, but not both.",

The majority of complications occurred in preschool age children, with an impressive number of cases (40 -22.4 %) under one year of age. We found a gender predominance (56.1 % male, 43.9 % female), primarily within the urban population (74.1 %). The most frequent complication of varicella was bacterial superinfection of skin lesions (40.6 %) and pneumonia (36.3 %). Cellulitis occurred in 67 cases, 11 cases presented abscess with various locations (facial, extremities, trunk), requiring multidisciplinary treatment. Streptococcus pyogenes was the leading cause of bacterial infections (46.2 %), but also Staphylococcus aureus was found in a few cases. Other cutaneous complications include hemorrhagic varicella (3 cases) or purpura fulminans (1 case) which is associated with thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Invasive group A streptococcal disease (GAS) appeared in four cases, presenting positive blood culture, and multiorgan involvement in two cases, with favorable evolutions after treatment. Other complications were neurologic, which were reported in 15 children (6 %); meningitis was the leading diagnosis, followed by encephalitis and cerebellitis. One case of decease occurred at a child with purpura fulminans. Conclusions Bacterial infections complicating chickenpox cause significant morbidity and mortality, mainly in patients younger than 5 years of age. Varicella increases the risk for acquiring GAS disease. Cellulitis is the most common infection, deep-seated and septic infections can occur in immunologically healthy children with varicella. Chickenpox continues to cause significant morbidity in the pediatric population.

Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and risk perception of the Institute's healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding Ebola virus disease and the recent epidemic.",

Extensive masses due to abdominopelvic actinomycosis raise challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problems due to frequent confusions with malignant tumors. First-line therapy includes high doses of penicillin over a prolonged period up to 6 months. Data concerning other antibiotics or shorter courses of therapy in actinomycosis are limited. We present a case of abdominopelvic actinomycosis with a complete remission after 42 days of penicillin combined with 21 days of tigecycline, in a 42 year-old woman hospitalized in \"Matei Bal\u0219\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases between 22.02-05.04.2016, who was later followed for 12 weeks after treatment. Case report A 43 year-old woman with solitary right kidney and a 12-year history of an intrauterine device presented to the urology department of \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital for a 2-month history of nausea, abdominal pain, 8 kg weight loss and dysuria. Imaging and laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia, obstructive renal failure, right ureterohydronephrosis and a large retroperitoneal mass of 10 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 10.4 cm involving the right ovary and uterus, invading the sigmoid, rectum, urinary bladder and compressing the right ureter. A double J stent and a urinary catheter were placed. The patient was consulted in the surgery ward for what was believed to be a metastatic ovarian carcinoma. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed dense but friable adhesions allowing only a left anexectomy with partial omentectomy and impeding a complete resection. Histological samples showed an inflammatory granulomatous tissue with multiple abscesses containing colonies of Actinomyces spp. and the patient was referred to the \"Matei Bal\u0219\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases. The patient was started on penicillin 12 million units/day for a total of 42 days. After the first 10 days of penicillin, tigecycline (100 mg/day) was added for 21 days for the treatment of concurrent urinary infection with MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to colistin and sensitive only to tigecycline and fosfomycin. The patient had a favorable clinical and biologic outcome. A CT assessment after 4 and 12 weeks revealed complete remission of the abdominopelvic mass with right ureterohydronephrosis and a few small abdominal adenopathies (<11 mm).",

The onset of illness was 7 days before admission with fever, chills and productive cough with purulent sputum. Medical history: hypertension and congestive heart failure class III NYHA. Admission exam: afebrile, right basal crackles at chest exam. Biological examination reveals: complete blood count -leukocytes number 7760 cells/mL with granulocytes percentage of 72.4 %; the rest of the biological exam in normal limits. Chest X-ray: right infrahilar internal alveolar opacity and cardiomegaly. Sputum culture reveals bacteria initially considered as Klebsiella spp. and further identified as R. planticola sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, moxifloxacin and resistant to ampicillin. The patient received moxifloxacin with favorable evolution after 7 days of treatment. Conclusions R. planticola infections are recently reported in human pathology and there are very few published cases of pneumonia. The bacteria can be confused with Klebsiella spp. and this could be an explanation of the scarcity of cases recorded in literature. Our case is not a health care associated infection; the patient comes from rural areas.

Seventeen patients (1 st group) did not show symptoms of Lyme borreliosis while 13 (2 nd group) were diagnosed with Lyme disease (LD). The mean span, while ticks were attached to the host was in average 1.7 days among persons in the first group while in second one -2.5 days. The incubation period in LD patients varied from 7 to 32 days, and lasted in average 13 days. The diagnosis was established based on clinical presentations, erythema migrans (EM) and was confirmed by ELISA IgM and IgG anti Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antibodies. The most frequently revealed were complains on EM, pain and local burning sensations. Patients from the first group were given prophylactic treatment with doxycycline 200 mg as a single dose or amoxicillin in case of contraindications. None of them developed LD during a 45 days follow up period. Treatment for LD patients was successful in most of the cases; 4 patients were given doxycycline 100 mg twice daily (BD) for 14 days, 2for 10 days and 1 had doxycycline 100 mg BD for 21 days. Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID for 14 days was prescribed to 3 patients and for 10 days in the same dosage to 2 patients. One person was given ceftriaxone 1 g BD for 21 days. Most of the patients had treatment as outpatients and just in 1 case the patient needed hospital treatment. During 45 days follow up period 1 patient was still complaining of anxiety, headaches and insomnia. Another one complained of general weakness. In one case skin lesions persisted despite of long lasting courses of antibiotics. Conclusions During a 60 days period LD was diagnosed in 13 patients who presented to the hospital with a history of tick bite. Fourteen patients were given doxycycline or amoxicillin as a prophylactic treatment which proved to be effective in all cases. Patients with LD were treated successfully with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a course lasting from 10 to 14 days as outpatients. In most of the acute LD cases outcomes were favorable.

The gender distribution of cases shows that 91 % of cases were women, 122 cases (67.77 %) being owners of pets (dogs). General clinical manifestations were represented by latch edema (44.44 %), headache (43.33 %), paresthesia (36.66 %), sweating (35.55 %), hoarseness (27.77 %), exanthemas (21.11 %) and abdominal pains (11.11 %).

In the studied cases we met decreased visual acuity in 9 cases, 6 cases of uveitis, 2 cases with retinal granuloma, and 4 cases of endophthalmitis, all cases being hospitalized in Ophthalmology Clinics for appropriate therapy. Biochemical tests useful for diagnosis were represented by: major hypereosiniphilia, hyperleukocytosis, increasing ESR and gammaglobulin. In our study, leukocytosis was found in 62 % of cases and hypereosiniphilia in 88 %. For the certain diagnosis of toxocariasis we used serological methods which consisted in determination of specific Toxocara antibodies. Toxocara antibodies were present in all studied patients.

The clinical exam showed left sequel hemiparesis, slightly diminished deep tendon reflexes on the left side and intensely impaired mobility. The lab reports showed acute inflammatory syndrome, coagulation disorders and elevated serum creatinine. A lumbosacral spine MRI scan conducted one day prior to admission described L4-L5 spondylodiscitis with massive anterior epidural abscesses and right paravertebral abscess. It was initially labeled as probably staphylococcal osteodiscitis and therapy was initiated with rifampin and levofloxacin with no clinical improvement and persistence of low-grade fever after 5 days, when rifampin was changed to linezolid. The evolution was apparently favorable (afebrile with decrease in biological inflammation markers), but the MRI conducted after one month of treatment revealed lesion progression. She was transferred to neurosurgery where a L4-L5 laminectomy was performed and during surgery a gray-yellow mass suggestive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) etiology was found. Wound and blood cultures were negative, Gram stain showed no bacteria and Ziehl-Neelsen stain failed to show acid-fast bacilli. Still, the histopathologic examination was highly suggestive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis etiology and anti-TB therapy was initiated with the 4-drug-regimen: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, with clinical and biological improvement. So far, the patient has undergone anti-TB therapy for 3 months with neurological improvement and a repeat MRI scan is scheduled when the patient completes 5 months of therapy.",

Results A total of 15 patients were admitted. The most affected age range was 55-64 years and males were more commonly affected than women. The diagnosis of referral was as follows: 4 patients have been directed with sepsis, 2 patients came with acute or chronic hepatitis, 1 with acute respiratory infection, 1 with salmonellosis, and 7 patients had no diagnosis of reference. At admission the diagnosis of sepsis was established in 5 patients, fever of unknown origin in 4 patients, enteroviral infection in 2 patients, and in other cases the diagnosis of acute hepatitis, influenza, food poisoning and yersiniosis was established. The identification of the primary source of infection was possible in 8 patients: infectious endocarditis 2 cases, urogenital sepsis 2 cases, HIV + tuberculosis 1 case, generalized form of salmonellosis 1 case, 1 case of lung infection (medial-lobe pneumonia), and 1 case of skin infection. Identification of etiologic agent was possible in 10 patients by bacteriological examinations. The causative agents most frequently found were the species of Staphylococcus: Staphylococcus aureus -1 case, Staphylococcus epidermidis -3 cases, Staphylococcus hemolyticus -4 cases, 1 case of Salmonella enteritidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis -1 case. The most commonly used antibiotics were generation III and IV cephalosporins, alone or associated with other antibiotics: metronidazole, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and in 2 cases vancomycin \u00b1 1 aminoglycoside was administered.",

We included patients diagnosed on clinical symptoms and detection of CD toxin in stool using polymerase chain reaction, which were treated with metronidazole, vancomycin and vancomycin plus at least 7 days of tigecycline. We excluded episodes in whom data to calculate Atlas severity score were not available. Recurrence was defined as another episode of diarrhoea, with positive toxin test within 8 weeks after the onset of the previous episode. Results From a total of 660 episodes of CDI we included 437 episodes (in 359 patients), of which 40 (9 %) were treated with metronidazole, 328 (75 %) with vancomycin and 69 (16 %) with tigecycline associated with vancomycin. Eighty-eight (20 %) episodes were CDI recurrences after the included episode. Forty-four (50 %) episodes from the recurrences group versus 156 (45 %) episodes from the group without recurrences were men (p = 0.22). The median age was similar for both groups: 71 years for patients with recurrences versus 70 years for patients without recurrences. There was no difference regarding the median Charlson score (4 for both groups) and the median Atlas severity score (3 for both groups). A neoplastic disease was diagnosed in 14 (16 %) CDI recurrence episodes versus 49 (14 %) CDI non-recurrence episodes (p = 0.423). The CDI recurrence episodes included in our analysis were treated with metronidazole in 9 (10 %) cases, vancomycin in 68 (77 %) cases and vancomycin plus tigecycline in 11(13 %) cases (p = 0.617). Thirty-three (38 %) episodes with recurrence as outcome of the included episode were preceded by recurrences versus 108 (31 %) episodes without recurrences after the current episode",

Etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral infections provides the necessary conditions for the proper management and improves clinical outcomes. Objectives: Identification of viral etiology of respiratory infections and establishing correlations between pathogens and clinical manifestations of infections produced in children.MethodsWe tested patients aged 0-14 years diagnosed with viral respiratory infections in our clinic between December 1, 2015 -May 31, 2016. Identification of respiratory viruses was achieved by rapid tests (MARI-POC) and by molecular methods -PCR performed in nasal secretions. We recorded changes in biological constants and clinical manifestations caused by respiratory viruses.ResultsIdentification of etiologic agents allowed appropriate epidemiological measures necessary to isolate the patients and the study of the incidence of seasonal viruses. The season 2015-2016 was dominated by the AH1N1 influenza virus. In much smaller proportions we diagnosed infections with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus. Influenza infection has evolved this season with high severity index. The severe complications of influenza in children were severe neurological diseases represented by febrile seizures, encephalitis and encephalitis reactions. Two cases of encephalitis have progressed to death.ConclusionsThe etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral infections has epidemiological and therapeutic implications. Infection with influenza viruses can cause severe complications and deaths, so we need prophylactic measures, early diagnosis and timely treatment administered.",

A percentage of 68.83 % of rectal swabs were positive for one microorganism, 25.97 % positive for 2 microorganisms and 5.20 % for 3 microorganisms. The total number of microorganisms isolated from rectal swabs was 315 (Escherichia coli 32.69 %, VRE 26.34 %, Klebsiella pneumoniae 23.17 %, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.39 %, Acinetobacter baumannii 4.12 % and other MDROs less than 3 % each). VRE carriage varied between 21.89 % in 2015 and 30.13 % in 2016. The proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producer strains has increased from 5/38 (13.1 %) in all year 2015 to 10/35 (28.5 %) in first 7 months of 2016. Only one other microorganism (Enterobacter cloacae) was carbapenemase producer. Conclusions MRSA colonization varied between 4.84 % (pharyngeal) and 5.79 % (nasal).

Methods A total of 7808 non-duplicated strains: 2067 Staphylococcus aureus, 651 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 292 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 922 Enterococcus faecalis, 251 Enterococcus faecium and 3621 Streptococcus pyogenes were tested for their antimicrobial resistance. Susceptibility tests were performed in automated systems Vitek 2C (BioMerieux) and MicroScan Walkaway (Siemens), and also with Sensititre (Thermo Scientific) MIC plates and Etest (BioMerieux); for Streptococcus pneumoniae disk diffusion method was used. Results were interpreted using CLSI and EUCAST criteria. Results Staphylococcus aureus resistance to oxacillin varied from 34.4 % in 2009 to 55.7 % in 2011 and has decreased to 44.8 % in 2015. Erythromycin and clindamycin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus have increased between 2009-2014 from 45.2 % to 58.1 %, and from 13.8 % to 58.3 %, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to quinolones have varied annually to ciprofloxacin (13.4-21.9 %) and moxifloxacin (8.4-16.8 %) without a clear increasing or decreasing tendency.",

The risk factors for carbapenemresistance are carbapenem usage and carbapenem-resistant bacteria transmission. The carbapenems usage in Romania increased with 113 % after 2013 (R2 = 0.746) and germ transmission is probably at a high level in our hospitals, as several very recent examples had proven.ConclusionsThe high percentage of carbapenem-resistance in Romania is related to misuse of carbapenems (generated by some pseudo-science myths) and to germ transmission in Romanian hospitals.

The two diseases can influence each other's evolution and the presence of one can facilitate infection with the other. In addition, the presentation, diagnosis, and management of syphilis differ in subtle ways between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Objectives: Determining the prevalence of syphilis in newly diagnosed HIV patients and identifying epidemiological, clinical and laboratory aspects in those coinfected.MethodsWe performed a retrospective study in patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" between the 1 st of January 2015 and 30 th of June 2016. Patients were tested for syphilis and we collected data regarding demographics, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory aspects in these patients, at baseline and in dynamics.ResultsWe included in our study 403 adults newly diagnosed with HIV infection in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"Prof.Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" between the 1 st of January 2015 and 30 th of June 2016. 295 (73.21 %) of those diagnosed with HIV were men and 108 (26.79 %) were women. A syphilis diagnostic test was performed in 301 (74.68 %) of these patients and 64 (16 %) had HIVsyphilis coinfection. A concomitant HIV-syphilis diagnosis was established for 57 (90 %) out of 64 patients. Out of 9 % of patients in whom a treponemal test was performed from the CSF, 6 % had a negative result and 3 % (2 patients) were diagnosed with neurosyphilis. Most of our patients with HIV syphilis coinfection were of reproductive age: most patients were aged between 30 and 39 years old (21 men and 7 women) while the second age group was that of 20-29 years old (13 men and 6 women). 20 (31.25 %) of the patients diagnosed with HIV and syphilis were diagnosed also with at least one type of hepatitis virus. Most of them, 18 (28.12 %) were infected with hepatitis C virus and 2 (3 %) had hepatitis B virus. Out of 64 patients with coinfection, 23 had AIDS at the time of diagnosis. The medium viral load at baseline was 594.251 copies/cmm and 18 patients had a viral load above 100000 copies/cmm. 192 (47.62 %) patients diagnosed with HIV received antiretroviral therapy. Conclusions Testing for other sexually transmitted diseases (especially syphilis) remains an important objective in HIV infected patients in order to prevent transmission and improve the outcome.

The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV infected patients.MethodsWe presented a retrospective study on patients born between 1988-1989, in which we included 216 patients diagnosed with AIDS, staged as A3, B3 and C AIDS, monitored in the Infectious Diseases Hospital of Ia\u0219i and admitted between 1 st of January and 31 st of December 2015.ResultsIn the 216 group of patients evaluated in the study, the percentage of female patients was 52.31 %, while in men it was 47.68 %. The prevalence of urban area was (64.56 %), versus only (35.44 %) for rural environment. AIDS C3 stage of disease represented 56.94 %, followed by B3 stage (27.7 %), C2 (8.33 %), and C1 stage (3.25 %). The therapy was established with local antifungal treatment in 32 % of the cases, 68 % receiving systemic treatment with Diflucan, instituted during hospitalization.ConclusionsThe degree of immunosuppression correlates with oropharyngeal manifestations of infection, oropharyngeal candidiasis having a very high prevalence in C3 staged patients.

The annual risk for active tuberculosis in these patients is 5-10 % per year, compared to 5-10 % for lifetime in uninfected individuals. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of TB infection in HIV infected patients.MethodsWe studied retrospectively the observation charts of patients with generalized tuberculosis, lung, lymph node and HIV infected hospitalized in the Regional HIV/AIDS Center Ia\u0219i, between the 1 st of January and 31 st of December 2015.ResultsDuring the year of 2015, in Ia\u0219i Infectious Diseases Hospital 15 cases of TB were registered among the total of 1060 HIV infected patients, that means a prevalence of 1.4 %. Of all patients, a number of 3 (20 %) were non-adherent, non-compliant to ARV therapy; 2 cases of TB (13.3 %) belonged to pediatric cohort with known and treated HIV infection, since childhood. In 4 cases (26.6 %) TB infection was revelatory for AIDS, and we registered 2 deaths (13.3 % of all patients hospitalized for TB). Note that in both cases the patients were ARV non-adherent, and non-compliant. At the moment of detection of TB infection, CD4 levels varied between 80 and 436 cells/cmm, and the values of viremia oscillated between 20 and 364000 copies/mL. The average duration of hospitalization was 9 days, requiring therapeutic approach in infectious diseases specialists team-intensive care specialistpsychologist.ConclusionsAlthough there is a low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, this condition is a challenge for infectious diseases specialists, psychologists and ATI specialists, regarding the therapeutic adherence and compliance and long-term care and follow-up of HIV positive patients that have also tuberculosis.A46 Retrospective analysis of HIV/AIDS deaths recorded in the Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital, Constan\u021ba in the period 01 January 2014-30 June 2016.

The median (interquartile range) age was 35 (26, 44) years and the mean \u00b1 standard deviation body mass index (BMI) was 23.65 \u00b1 3.97 kg/sqm. A total of 42 (37 %) patients were overweight/obese. Almost all our patients were on antiretroviral therapy (115/119) and 69 (73 %) patients had comorbidities. The median recent CD4 cell count was 518.00 (305.50, 745.50) cells/mL. Regarding risk factors: most of our patients (70 %) were not consuming alcohol; almost half of our patients (45 %) were smokers. Most of the patients were performing moderate (39 %) or intense (36 %) physical activity. The BMI was influenced by lipid profile, a higher proportion of overweight/obese patients were identified in the group of patients with high triglycerides levels or high LDL level compared with the group with normal values (p = 0.0002, p = 0.013). We also observed that triglycerides and cholesterol were not influenced by alcohol consumption (p = 0.617, p = 0.802) or by smoking (p = 0.317, p = 0.275). Heavy drinking may have a negative impact on glycemia levels, becoming a risk factor for diabetesin our study there was a higher percentage of alcohol users in the group of patients with high glycemia (p = 0.041). Smoking was not associated with hydroxyvitamin D concentration (p = 0.568) or parathyroid hormone value (p = 0.944), but smoking was identified as a risk factor for femoral osteopenia (p = 0.013). Physical activity was not associated with HIV status; the proportion of patients performing intense physical activity was similar in the group of patients with recent CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/ cmm compared with the group of patients with recent CD4 cell count higher than 500 cells/cmm (p = 0.802).ConclusionsConsidering the duration of HIV infection a risk factor for complications due to chronic inflammation, the modifiable risk factor (smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentariness) should be avoided for a better quality of life.1.

Results Ia\u0219i Regional Center follows 1475 patients that are HIV infected, of which 676 women, that represents a percentage of 45.83 % of the total. A number of 623 represents women at childbearing age (13-49 years), which represents 92.16 % of all HIV positive women. In the mentioned period, 133 women gave birth, representing 21.35 % of all women with HIV infection at childbearing age. Counties distribution showed a higher incidence in Bac\u0103u, namely 21.81 % (39 newborn) and the year with most births occurred in 2013 with 33 newborn (24.81 %). 79.7 % of patients received treatment with KLT + CVB, 10 women were detected with HIV infection at birth. 94 % of children were born by Caesarian section.

We aimed to analyze the risk factors associated with unfavorable evolution in these patients. Methods Retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical course and treatment characteristics in patients with HIV infection hospitalized at \"Prof. Dr. Matei Bal\u0219\" Institute in the period 1 January to 31 December 2015 which had positive blood cultures during hospitalization. We watched accurate risk factors associated with death by identifying statistically significant difference (p<0.05) using Epi Info version 7.2. Results In the analyzed period 62 patients were identified with HIV infection hospitalized who had positive blood cultures during hospitalization; 11 of them have died and 51 have evolved favorably. The average age of the deceased patients was 36.7 years vs. 33.8 years (p<0.05) and the percentage of males was higher in both groups (90.9 % vs. 74.5 %). The acute episode appeared on average after 4.2 years after the detection of HIV infection in those who died vs. 2.8 years (p<0.05). Only 3/11 patients (27.3 %) received antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in history vs. 23/ 51 (45.1 %). The following entry gates were identified: respiratory Only respiratory entry gate was significantly associated with risk of death (p<0.05; CI 95: 1.86-8.82). No significant differences were identified in terms of weight isolated microorganisms (AFB: 38.5 % vs. 16.9 %; GPC: 38.5 % vs. 47.5 %; GPB: 0 vs. 3.4 %; GNB: 7.7 % vs. 28.8 % and fungi: 15.4 % vs. 3.4 %. 6/13 microorganisms had resistance mechanisms to classical antibiotics and antifungals (46.2 %) vs. 19/59 (32.2 %). The average level of CD4 count was significantly lower in the group of HIV deceased (16 cells/cmm vs. 134 cells/cmm; p<0.05), the mean HIV-RNA was significantly lower (299 038 c/mL vs. 844 871 c/mL; p<0.05) and average value of procalcitonin was higher (69.81 pg/mL vs. 19.93 pg/mL). The average length of hospitalization was significantly lower in those who died (11 vs. 20.5 days). Conclusions Risk factors associated with death in HIV-infected patients with positive blood cultures were: older age of the patient, longer duration of evolution of HIV uncontrolled infection, respiratory entry gate of systemic infection, severe immunosuppression (CD4 count below 50 cells/cmm) and short duration of hospitalization. Demographics: group A-F/M = 46 (30.06 %)/107 (69.94 %) vs group B-F/M = 61/52(53.99 %/46.01 %); p = 0.0001. Chronological distribution of new cases show a top of incidence in 2008 (46 cases-40.71 %) and in 2015 (46 cases-30.07 %). The main mode of transmission was sexual-group A vs group B (89.55 % vs 50.44 %); p = 0.0001. Children born from HIV infected mothers were: group A vs group B-5 (3.26 %) vs 2 (1.76 %).

A sustained under-treatment viral suppression was noticed in 61.11 % cases from a total of 84 % of cases being under antiretroviral therapy. Remission of the symptoms was obtained by using oral treatment with vancomycin in 72.22 % of the patients, metronidazole in 22.22 % and intravenous treatment with tigecycline in 5.55 %. No case of fulminant CDI was reported and no death case directly attributable to CD infection. 5 patients of all (27.77 %) encountered relapses. Conclusions In our study, conformable to international medical data, Clostridium difficile proved to be the most frequent cause for infectious diarrhea in HIV-positive patients.
