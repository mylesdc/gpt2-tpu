The model accounts for stochastic interaction between bacteria and cells of the immune system and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection of individual hosts within a population. Model output is the dose-response relation and the dose-dependent distribution of time until response, where response is the onset of symptoms. The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose. The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose-response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose ( probit model). The findings of this study support experimental evidence and postulations from other investigations that response is, in fact, influenced by both in-host and between-host variability.",

However, the reliability of any estimation is critically dependent on the model used, and its suitability in representing the biological phenomena related to the pathogen in question. The earliest efforts were at the beginning of the twentieth century, and concern a hypothesis that response (i.e. illness or death) occurs in an individual only if the exposed dose is greater than an innate tolerance level. Irwin [1] refers to the least dose required for response as the individual effective dose. In order to appreciate the observed variability in host response for different levels of dose, the tolerance levels of individuals are assumed to be distributed throughout a population, typically by the lognormal distribution [1, 2] (i.e. the commonly referred to probit model of dose-response). Other distributions can also be used-for example, the Weibull distribution [3] .",

A crucial difference between independent action and individual effective dose is in the way in which the bacteria are perceived to interact; maximum synergism between bacteria in the latter (because the size of the dose alone dictates outcome), contrast with none in the former (because bacteria act independently). Time until response can be incorporated within the exponential dose-response model by defining b in equation (1.1) as a function of time and not as a constant. Functions that have been used to this end are the distribution functions of the exponential, Weibull, lognormal and gamma distributions [6, 7] . These distributions are commonly fitted to incubation period data for a broad spectrum of infectious diseases, such as AIDS [8] , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [9] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [10] and Legionnaires' disease [11] . For example, if the exponential distribution function is used, then P R (k, t) \u00bc 1 \u00c0 e \u00c0b(1\u00c0e \u00c0pt )k , ( 1 :2) where t is the time post-exposure and p is the shape parameter. This approach has been used to model infectious diseases caused by various intracellular bacteria (i.e. those that replicate within cells), including Francisella tularensis. In [7] , the exponential dose-response relation (equation (1.1)) is fitted to monkey tularaemia data with the aforementioned distribution functions used for time until death. Although the authors state that their analysis serves to model the in vivo bacterial kinetics, there is a limited appreciation of the biological mechanisms at play, and the distributions are selected only on their ability to approximate the data. While the authors acknowledge the single-hit interpretation of the exponential dose-response relation, they do not discuss what might constitute a 'hit', or the appropriateness of a hit-type model for this bacterium.",

They therefore interpret b through the competing risks of spore clearance (rate m) and germination (rate l) such that b \u00bc l/(l \u00fe m). It is assumed that the time from exposure to germination is exponentially distributed, giving rise to a relation equivalent to equation (1.2).

First, the host inhales a quantity of organisms all of which are transported to the extracellular space within the lung (forthwith referred to as the lung-space). Here, they are predated upon by cells of the immune system that can kill the bacteria directly (by degrading the membrane) or through a process called phagocytosis, whereby phagocytic cells (such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells) engulf the bacteria. However, upon phagocytosis, obligate intracellular bacteria can evade the antimicrobial defences and reproduce within the phagocyte. Following this intracellular proliferation, a phagocyte dies, releasing its contents into the lung-space. Thus, three events are possible: death (killing of bacteria) with rate m . 0, survival ( phagocytosis of bacteria not resulting in bacterial death) with rate a . 0 and birth (release of G[N bacteria from a bacteria-containing phagocyte) with rate l . 0. Response is said to occur when the number of extracellular bacteria in the lung-space reaches the threshold, M. Conversely, infection is said to have resolved when the number of extracellular bacteria and bacteria-containing phagocytes both reach zero. This can be modelled as a continuous-time two-dimensional Markov chain; a stochastic process, X \u00bc fX(t); t ! 0g, in which the state of the system is the double X \u00bc fT,Pg, where T \u00bc B \u00fe P denotes the total number of extracellular bacteria, B[N, and bacteria-containing phagocytes, P[N. The Markov chain for this process is depicted in figure 1b with, as an example, G \u00bc 3 bacteria released upon phagocyte death. Note that the initial state is fk, 0g. A deterministic solution of this process is obtained by solving dB/dt \u00bc lGP2(m \u00fe a)B and dP/dt \u00bc aB2lP with B(0) \u00bc k and",

In addition, a numerical solution is considered by means of discrete-event simulation ( pseudo-code in figure 2 ). This approach serves to represent exactly the Markov model described above and provides equivalent results to the analytical approach (given, of course, a sufficient number of runs). An advantage of this is that host heterogeneity can be conveniently incorporated by sampling the threshold M from an appropriate distribution at each run of the simulation (an idea mentioned, but not adopted, in the birth-death model of [23] and in the simple bacterial growth model of [24] ). Incorporating host heterogeneity (individual effective dose) alongside stochasticity with respect to bacteria-cell dynamics (individual action) has support from the in vivo studies [25, 26] , from which it is claimed that neither component of variability is alone sufficient to explain experimental results.",

In an in vitro study [28] , human macrophages are infected with Schu S4. The authors find that at 16 h there is no evidence of cytopathogenicity and at 24 and 32 h, 8% and 25% of infected cells are unhealthy. Because cell death is governed by non-instantaneous processes [19] , defining an actual time of death in such a study would not be possible. Here, the mean time until phagocyte death is taken as the time at which 50% of cells are unhealthy. However, such information is not expressly provided in [28] , and so a value is estimated by fitting a distribution to the data that is available (by maximum likelihood). Because the final stages of the intracellular life cycle are poorly understood [29] , the choice of distribution is not motivated by the biological mechanisms involved, but purely by goodness of fit. A lognormal distribution function (with log-mean 3.72 and log-standard deviation 0.385) is found to provide the best approximation to these data (by loglikelihood value) when evaluated alongside a gamma, Weibull and log-logistic distribution. With this distribution, a median time of 41.5 h (figure 3a) is found (2.5% of cells are unhealthy by 19.5 h and 97.5% unhealthy by 88.2 h); the reciprocal of which is the birth rate, i.e. l \u00bc 0.0241 per hour.",

These are obtained by using the deterministic solution of the birth-death-survival model for extracellular bacteria over time (equation (2.1)) with data from studies in which humans are exposed to aerosolized Schu S4, and inhaled dose and incubation period are explicitly recorded. To this end, the datasets of [32, 33] are used, which each contain 16 subjects.

This result is verified from the matrix-analytic approach (the electronic supplementary material, B), with M set equal to 500 (a value large enough such that response is inevitable if reached-i.e. a 'point of no return'-see later). In order to assess the validity of the model, results are also plotted from a number of experimental studies involving human infection with aerosolized Schu S4 [32, 33, [41] [42] [43] [44] (in [42] , the inoculum is aged prior to delivery). Note that none of these data has been used within the parametrization of the model. Also included are a number of dose-response relations that have been produced in other studies (the dose-response relation derived in [7] is not included, because it considers the infection of monkeys and not humans). Interestingly, the solution is well approximated by an exponential distribution (visually indistinguishable from the blue line in figure 4 ; not shown), indicating that the birthdeath-survival model for F. tularensis may be interpreted as a single-hit-type model. To explore this further, consider the time immediately after exposure. Here, there are no bacteriacontaining phagocytes and two events can occur: death (killing of bacteria), with probability p d \u00bc m/(m \u00fe a) \u00bc 0.97, or survival ( phagocytosis of bacteria not resulting in bacterial death), with probability p s \u00bc a/(m \u00fe a) \u00bc 0.03. If just one bacterium survives phagocytosis and proliferates then ultimately 358 bacteria are released back into the lung-space. To resolve infection, then all of these bacteria must be killed and this occurs with probability p 358 d % 10 \u00c05 (as events are independent). Hence, the survival of just one bacterium is effectively sufficient to cause illness. This can be modelled by a binomial distribution ( \u00a71) which gives rise to the exponential distribution function (equation (1.1) with b % p s ). Therefore, the birth -death -survival model for F. tularensis can be interpreted as a single-hit-type model whereby a 'hit' is defined as the failed phagocytosis of a single bacterium. Note that if the threshold is fixed, say at the median M med \u00bc 2.4 \u00c2 10 11 , then an equivalent dose-response relation is produced (because the probability of resolution is negligible for just 358 extracellular bacteria).",

As further verification, the median number of bacteria-containing phagocytes at the time of illness for the simulation results is assessed and found to be within an order of magnitude of the deterministic solution (equation (2.3) into equation (2. 2)) at all doses. For comparison, data from a number of relevant studies involving human infection with aerosolized Schu S4 [32, 33, [41] [42] [43] [44] are included within figure 5.

            "text": "While the birth-death model is, in itself, inappropriate for representing intracellular bacteria ( \u00a71), it has provided a useful foundation for the birth-death-survival model considered here. In the 1960s, there was considerable academic interest in the mathematics of the simple birth-death model, involving stochastic differential equations [14,15] and generating functions [48] . However, very few experimental studies have actually made use of these results, despite a thorough account [23] crediting their ability in representing data for a variety of diseases. That paper [23] and methods therein are however not without their critics. It is claimed [5] that while the overall picture provided by the basic birth-death model corresponds remarkably well to what is found in practice, the underlying interpretations are flawed and there is no experimental evidence to suggest any form of stochastic mechanism in the infection dynamics. However, this is later refuted in an in vivo study [40] (in which monkeys are exposed to aerosolized type A F. tularensis), whose conclusions state that organisms act independently of each other and that clinical and anatomic manifestations of the infection occur when the bacterial burden attains a given level. A number of potential limitations of the birth-deathsurvival model are now discussed. The underlying Markov structure of the model restricts the choice of statistical distribution in representing the occurrence of the three events-birth, death and survival-to those for which the Markov property holds. The simplest choice is the exponential distribution (in which events occur at random). Because of the memoryless property of this distribution, the length of time from bacterial uptake until phagocytic death is unknown, and so it is not possible to deduce the number of bacteria released on death (through equation (2.5)). Instead, an average number is used for all such instances-corresponding to the average time until phagocytic death ( \u00a72.2.1). But by removing this legitimate source of variability, this falsely increases the certainty of any model results. In fact, this relates to another issue-the suitability of the exponential distribution in the first place. For death and survival, this choice is justified, because the movement of bacteria [49] and phagocytes [50] has similar properties to that of a random walk. However, for the time from bacterial uptake to cell death and the associated release of bacteria (birth), a simple incell mechanistic model (based on a pure birth process with saturation of available nutrients) suggests that the variance is being overestimated by the exponential distribution. In other areas, however, the variability may well be underestimated, because the model fails to account for variability in other sources that can affect dispersion, such as bacterial age [42] , diameter [7, 51] , agglutination, number retained and deposition site [23] .",

While the magnitude of these rates changes as the adaptive immune response becomes more involved ( \u00a72.2.3), the timing and extent to which this occurs are not known (owing to a lack of understanding and data regarding this transition). Instead, it is assumed that the length of time from exposure until response is insufficient for any discernible effect of the adaptive response to become apparent. However, if the adaptive response does come into effect before the time of illness, then this would, at first, reduce the growth rate of extracellular bacteria; decreasing the probability of response and increasing the incubation period of those that do respond (this is more likely to affect those with lower dose). If the effect of the adaptive immune response on the event rates could be quantified, then the discrete-event simulation approach used in this study could be modified with ease. Third, the model assumes the single infection of cells-that is, a phagocyte may engulf only one bacterium-the validity of which is unknown. In the review of the literature for F. tularensis, no information could be found regarding the number of bacteria that can be simultaneously phagocytosed by any one cell in vivo (although it is thought that uptake is low in vitro [28, 52] ). Finally, it is assumed that there is an unlimited supply of phagocytes. This assumption is made, because the mechanisms that govern the number of viable phagocytes within the lungspace are complex and potentially unknown and, in any case, there are insufficient data to provide a parametrization.",

This is because the parametrization of l and G is based on an in vitro study [28] that only considers the macrophage, whereas in vivo, a number of cell types could be involved-although, the principal target of F. tularensis is indeed the macrophage [27] . The number of bacteria released is estimated by determining the amount of intracellular bacterial growth that begins from phagocytosis until cell death. Assuming logistic growth following an initial delay (to account for phagosomal escape), it is found that there are approximately 358 bacteria at the time of death. While there is no comparable study to validate this result specifically, the validity of the intracellular doubling time can be assessed. For the first 24 h, this is found to be 3.5 h, which is within the range of 3-8 h (obtained from reported fold increase using equation (2.6)) found in [54] (in which human cells are infected with Schu S4) for an equivalent timeframe.

This is the only part of the parametrization in which animal and not human data are used and, as stated in [56] , animal models must be carefully reviewed for applicability to humans, because of the inherent variability in host/micro-organism interaction. Here, it has been assumed that the birth, death and survival rates are equivalent in humans and monkeys, but the threshold for illness is lower (10 times according to [24] , owing to monkey body weight being one-tenth that of a human). This supports the shorter incubation periods for monkeys (48-72 h) when compared with humans, and as a result only data up to 48 h are used in this study (latter times could involve illness which may indicate the transition to the adaptive response-see above). Note that attempting to estimate all four parameters of equation (2.1) through these data provides a set of non-unique parameter values owing to an insufficient number of degrees of freedom.",

In estimating the survival and death rate ( \u00a72.2.3), the deterministic solution for extracellular bacteria over time (equation (2.1)) is fitted to data from the two in vivo studies (figure 3c). These data clearly suggest an initial drop in the number of extracellular bacteria followed by exponential growth (the rate of which is lower in less virulent strains [7] ). A birth-death model cannot represent these characteristics (not shown, but exemplified in [23] in fitting to guinea pig plague data), but an accurate portrayal is obtained by extending this standard approach to incorporate phagocytosis. Furthermore, fitting the birth-death deterministic solution only yields the net growth rate, l 2 m, which does not provide an explicit parametrization required to obtain the dose-response relation and incubation period distribution (by either the asymptotic approaches of [14] and [15] , or by the matrix-analytic approach detailed in the electronic supplementary material, A).",

            "text": "It is assumed that clinical infection occurs when some threshold number of bacteria is in the system. The triggering of symptoms is a very complex process with few data available to validate more detailed models. It is likely that the threshold will vary by individual, and it appears that a fixed threshold poorly describes the data (figure 5) at higher doses given the variability assumed in the other parameters. This is because the process is more deterministic in the higher dose rangean observation consistent with the standard birth-death model with host homogeneity [5, 23] . On the other hand, if the threshold is lognormally distributed then, given deterministic exponential growth, the times at which the number of extracellular bacteria reach this threshold are normally distributed, as deduced for doses of 300 organisms and greater (not possible to verify from [43] owing to the recording sensitivity). This increased dispersion enables the model to capture the variability exhibited in the data for such doses. However, at lower doses, the majority of the variability is attributable to the stochastic in-host processes, so the characterization of the threshold itself plays a lesser role. This variability is caused by an initial bistability, but as the numbers of extracellular bacteria start to increase they reach a 'point of no return', from which the process becomes deterministic. This is supported in fitting the three-parameter lognormal distribution to low dose fixed threshold data, whereby an estimated location parameter of 3-4 days indicates the duration of the deterministic processes (cf. anthrax model of [47] ). For the same dose range with the distributed threshold model, this and some other standard two-parameter distributions are unable to represent the skewness and kurtosis of the modelled incubation period distributions (figure 6b). In fact, the only distribution, out of those considered, that is able to do so is the (four parameter) Johnson SU family of distributions. While the gamma distribution would appear to provide the least appropriate choice, the lognormal distribution-long associated with modelling incubation periods [57, 58] -is also clearly unsuitable.",

Also considered is the heterogeneity of individuals through a distributed threshold required for illness. For F. tularensis, this raises some interesting parallels to some of the classical dose-response models. First, the infection dynamics for dose-response can be simplified to the single-hit model, whereby the hit required for response is a failed phagocytosis. Second, the thresholds are found to be lognormally distributed, as in the probit model. These findings thus support the experimental evidence and postulations of [25, 26] that response is a mixture of both the hypotheses of independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model).
