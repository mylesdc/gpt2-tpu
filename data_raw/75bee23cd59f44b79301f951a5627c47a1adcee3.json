            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus and member of the New World alphaviruses. It causes a biphasic febrile illness that can be accompanied by central nervous system involvement and moderate morbidity in humans and severe mortality in equines. The virus has a history of weaponization, lacks FDA-approved therapeutics and vaccines in humans, and is considered a select agent. Like other RNA viruses, VEEV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and eventually induces apoptosis. The capsid protein, which contains a nuclear localization and a nuclear export sequence, induces a shutdown of host transcription and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Here we show that infection with VEEV causes a dysregulation of cell cycling and a delay in the G 0 /G 1 phase in Vero cells and U87MG astrocytes. Cells infected with VEEV encoding a capsid NLS mutant or treated with the capsid-importin \u03b1 interaction inhibitor G281-1485 were partially rescued from this cell cycle dysregulation. Pathway analysis of previously published RNA-sequencing data from VEEV infected U87MG astrocytes identified alterations of canonical pathways involving cell cycle, checkpoint regulation, and proliferation. Multiple cyclins including cyclin D1, cyclin A2 and cyclin E2 and other regulators of the cell cycle were downregulated in infected cells in a capsid NLS dependent manner. Loss of Rb phosphorylation, which is a substrate for cyclin/cdk complexes was also observed. These data demonstrate the importance of capsid nuclear localization and/or importin \u03b1 binding for inducing cell cycle arrest and transcriptional downregulation of key cell cycle regulators.",

VEEV, along with the closely related eastern (EEEV) and western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV), are part of the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, and considered part of the \"New World\" clade owing to their geographic distribution and disease course (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . Due to ease of aerosolization, low infectious dose in humans, and the ability to grow to high titers in tissue culture, VEEV was weaponized by both the US and USSR as an incapacitating agent (Steele et al., 2007; Leitenberg et al., 2012) . Thusly, VEEV is considered a select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for use in humans, making VEEV an agent of concern for potential bioterrorist use (Sidwell and Smee, 2003) . TC83 is a live attenuated vaccine strain, which has investigational new drug status and can be used for at risk personnel. TC83 was generated via passaging in guinea pig heart cells 83 times (Berge et al., 1961) and its attenuation is due to mutations in the 5 \u2032 -non-coding region and the E2 glycoprotein (Kinney et al., 1993) .",

Though mortality is rare in humans, severe cases progress into central nervous system involvement and are accompanied by long-term sequelae including memory loss, insomnia, and personality change, especially in children (Steele et al., 2007; Steele and Twenhafel, 2010) . Incubation is typically 2-5 days, and acute disease persists for 4-6 days; occasionally the disease becomes biphasic 4-8 days later with neurological and systemic involvement such as brain hemorrhaging and edema, necrotizing vasculitis, lymphocyte destruction, neutrophilic infiltration, and neuronal degradation (Weaver et al., 2004) . There are many research gaps surrounding the process of VEEV neuroinvasion (especially from sites of peripheral inoculation), target cell populations, host/virus interactions, and the molecular impact of infection on host cell processes such as cell cycle, proliferation, antiviral responses, and apoptosis (Weaver et al., 2004; Steele et al., 2007; Reichert et al., 2009; Lundberg et al., 2017) .",

Checkpoint modulators are typically switched \"on\" through phosphorylation, which in turn enables their own kinase activity. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are typically thought of as the master regulators. They are usually constitutively expressed, but they have no activity until bound to their corresponding cyclin. Cyclins do not possess kinase activity, but their levels fluctuate corresponding to the phase of the cell cycle where they are needed. Cyclin D is expressed throughout the cell cycle, but is specifically needed for entry into the cell cycle. Cyclin E regulates the progression from G 1 into S phase. Cyclin A levels begin to rise in S phase then plateau in G 2 . Cyclin B is necessary for progression from G 2 into mitosis. Stressors such as nutrient deprivation or DNA damage stall or halt the cell cycle until the issue is remedied or the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis [cell cycle reviewed extensively in (Gra\u00f1a and Reddy, 1995; Weinberg, 1995; Schafer, 1998) ].",

In synchronized Vero cells, replicating virus induces a delay in the G 0 /G 1 phase. The trafficking of the viral capsid protein is at least partially responsible for the delay, as cells infected with a viral strain coding for capsid with a mutated nuclear localization signal (NLS), referred to as VEEV TC83_Cm (Atasheva et al., 2010a; Lundberg et al., 2016) , reentered the cell cycle sooner than cells infected with VEEV TC83. Cell cycle-related genes are largely downregulated in VEEV TC83-infected cell, but the phenotype is reversed with VEEV TC83-Cm.",

Mutating the NLS alters capsid localization, retaining it primarily in the cytoplasm (Atasheva et al., 2010a; Lundberg et al., 2016) ; additionally, chemically inhibiting the interaction between capsid and importin \u03b1/\u03b21 reduces viral titer and prolongs cell survival (Lundberg et al., 2013; Shechter et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2018) . Mutation of the NLS also prevents capsid from host cell transcriptional suppression (Atasheva et al., 2010b) . We hypothesized that capsid's ability to interfere with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and/or transcription contributes to the observed cell cycle delay. To test this hypothesis, we used a TC83 strain coding for a mutated NLS in the capsid (Cm) (Atasheva et al., 2010a; Lundberg et al., 2016) . This mutated capsid lacks the ability to gain access to the nucleus (Supplementary Figure 1C ) (Lundberg et al., 2016) and its replication kinetics are not different than parental TC83 (Supplementary Figure 1B) (Atasheva et al., 2010b) . At 16 hpi, mock infected cells had started to return to cycling while TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells were still delayed in G 1 , but by 24 hpi, S and G 2 /M populations in TC83_Cm infected cells had increased while TC83 infected cells were still delayed ( Figure 2B ). Representative histograms also provide visual demonstration of cell cycle dysregulation (Supplementary Figure 1A) .",

Similar to what was observed in Vero cells, VEEV infection resulted in an accumulation of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase (Figure 3A) . Infection of U87MG cells with VEEV TC83_Cm displayed an intermediate phenotype and by 24 hpi more closely mirrored the cell cycle distribution of mock infected cells. Analysis of VEEV E2 positive cells revealed that the majority of the cell population was infected at 16 and 24 hpi (Supplementary Figure 2A) . Further if cell cycle analysis was performed on only VEEV E2 positive cells for TC83 and TC83_Cm samples, cell cycle arrest was still observed (Supplementary Figure 2B) . VEEV infection causes cell death and thus dying cells may confound the flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. To alleviate this issue, dead or dying cells were gated out during all flow cytometry experiments due to differences in Pathways selected for cell cycle regulation and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RNA from VEEV-TrD infected (MOI 5) U87MG cells was collected at 16 hpi, sequenced, and compared to mock-infected controls. Depicted in the left-hand column is the canonical pathway.

By 24 hpi both TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells displayed fewer viable cells with a corresponding increase in necrotic cells. These data indicate that there are some differences in cell viability at 24 hpi in both TC83 and TC83_Cm infected cells.

VEEV infected cells treated with G281-1485 displayed a cell cycle profile similar to mock infected cells, suggesting that disruption of capsid-importin \u03b1 interaction relieves the cell cycle delay. Mock infected cells also revealed an altered cell cycle profile in the presence of G281-1485, which could be due to G281-1485 influencing other importin \u03b1 cargo proteins. While G281-1485 can disrupt capsid-importin \u03b1 interaction, it is not a selective inhibitor and therefore has the ability to impact other importin \u03b1 cargo, as demonstrated by its ability to disrupt the SV40 large T antigen-importin \u03b1 interaction (Thomas et al., 2018) . Thus, capsid is at least partially responsible for the delay at G 1 and dysregulation of nuclear import and/or transcription is certainly a contributing factor to VEEV-induced cell cycle abnormalities.",

In addition, capsid is known to downregulate host transcription and TC83_Cm loses this ability (Atasheva et al., 2010b) . Based on those results, we wanted to see what affect TC83_Cm would have on cell cycle genes on the RNA level. U87MG cells were mock-infected, infected with TC83, or infected with TC83_Cm (MOI 10). At 16 hpi, RNA was extracted and cell cycle genes ( Table 2) were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Once again, HDAC9 was significantly upregulated, even in cells infected with the vaccine strain, but its levels in cells infected with TC83_Cm more closely resembled mock infected cells ( Figure 5B) . The other two predicted upregulated genes, CDK6 and HDAC10 were not altered in either TC83 or TC83_Cm infected cells. However, all but one cell cycle gene predicted to be downregulated were significantly down compared in TC83 infected cells and less depressed when infected with TC83_Cm ( Figure 5B) . Because TC83_Cm has a mutated NLS and remains in the cytoplasm, this indicates capsid is partially responsible for the dysregulation of the cell cycle related genes upon VEEV infection, and that its interaction with host karyopherins is also a contributing factor.",

This indicates that TC83_Cm, though virulence is reduced in mice (Atasheva et al., 2015) , is not replication deficient compared to TC83 in U87MG cells, as has been confirmed in other cell lines (Atasheva et al., 2015; Lundberg et al., 2016) , and that differences in host transcriptional expression between the two viruses is owing to the mutated NLS.",

Changes in cyclin E2 and A2 levels were MOI dependent at 16 hpi. Surprisingly cyclin D1 expression was also dramatically decreased in VEEV infected cells at 16 and 24 hpi ( Figure 6A ) even though cyclin D1 mRNA levels were not decreased ( Figure 5B ). Rb is a substrate of cyclin D and E complexes, with phosphorylation releasing the transcription factor E2F and allowing transcription of many cell cycle regulated transcripts (Vermeulen et al., 2003) . Assessment of Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, which is a residue primarily phosphorylated by cyclin D1 (Kitagawa et al., 1996) , revealed a loss of Rb phosphorylation following VEEV infection ( Figure 6B) . These results indicate that cyclin D1, E2, and A2 protein expression and Rb phosphorylation are reduced following VEEV infection, corresponding to the observed VEEV induced cell cycle alterations.",

Upon VEEV infection, capsid blocks nucleocytoplasmic trafficking through forming a tetrameric complex with CRM1, importin \u03b1 and importin \u03b2. This block results in transcriptional suppression, including an overall decrease in cell cycling associated transcripts, inducing a delay primarily at G 0 /G 1 . Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is intact in uninfected cells. Proteins affected by the block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking were not determined in this study but are hypothesized to be transcription factors, cell cycle regulators and/or mitotic assembly factors. The specific cyclin and cdk proteins affected following VEEV infection are indicated.

            "text": "Vero and U87MG cells, replicating virus induces a delay in the G 0 /G 1 phase (Figures 1, 2A, 3A) . The association of the viral capsid protein with importin \u03b1 is at least partially responsible for the delay, as cells infected with a viral strain (TC83_Cm) coding for capsid with a mutated NLS (Atasheva et al., 2010a; Lundberg et al., 2016) and treatment of cells with a capsid-importin \u03b1 inhibitor reentered the cell cycle faster than cells infected with TC83 (Figures 2B, 3A,B) . As nsP2 is known to induce host translational shutoff (Bhalla et al., 2016) , it not surprising that mutation of capsid alone is incapable of completely correcting the observed cell cycle arrest. Another possible contributing factor is the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) following VEEV infection (Baer et al., 2016a) . UPR induction is triggered by the sensing of improperly folded proteins and leads to inhibition of translation and potentially apoptosis (Walter and Ron, 2011) . During viral infections a high burden is placed on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to fold the enormous amount of viral proteins (typically glycoproteins) being produced. VEEV infection induces the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR, with corresponding increases in ATF4 and CHOP expression (Baer et al., 2016a) . Interestingly, UPR activation via tunicamycin treatment results in decreased cyclin D1 protein translation and inhibition of cell cycle progression (Brewer et al., 1999) . These findings are consistent with our data showing that VEEV infected cells have decreased cyclin D1 protein levels, but not mRNA levels. It is likely a combination of capsid induced transcriptional inhibition and translation (nSP2 and/or UPR mediated) suppression that alters the cell cycle following VEEV infection.",

From this perspective, VEEV infection may induce a G 0 /G 1 delay, or \"stutter\" that is not as profound in TC83_Cm-infected cells and is also not a complete shutdown of the cell cycle (at least at lower MOIs). Further compounding the issue is the observation that cyclin D1 protein levels are dramatically decreased and Rb phosphorylation suppressed at 16 and 24 hpi.

            "text": "The inability to reenter the cell cycle could have profound implications for astrocyte function following VEEV infection. Once a controversial in vitro model, astrocytes have been shown to support VEEV infection in vivo in mouse models (Peng et al., 2013; Cain et al., 2017) , though the major target cells in humans have yet to be identified (de la Monte et al., 1985; Ludlow et al., 2016) owing to the rarity of autopsy materials (Weaver et al., 2004) . Astrocytes collect and distribute energy substrates and neurotransmitters in addition to defending and supporting neurons and contributing to the brain architecture and environment (Kettenmann, 2011) . While astrocytes are typically quiescent cells, they have the capability to enter the cell cycle in response to injury (Buffo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009) . Reactive astrogliosis is an increase in astrocyte numbers, which can be induced via multiple pathological conditions including trauma, infection, ischemic damage, neuroinflammation, or neurodegeneration (Pekny and Pekna, 2014) . Between 1 and 50% of reactive astrocytes in various brain injuries are proliferating (Wang et al., 2009) . Astrogliosis can be viewed as beneficial limiting tissue damage and restoring CNS homeostasis, but prolonged astrogliosis can lead to negative consequences including glial scar formation and inhibition of axon regeneration (Pekny and Pekna, 2014) . Astrogliosis as indicated by increased GFAP staining, a marker of astrocyte proliferation, and apoptosis were observed in VEEV infected mice (Schoneboom et al., 2000) . Both astrogliosis and neuronal apoptosis were positively correlated with pathogenesis. Astrogliosis was found in regions where VEEV antigen was present as well as in regions without detectable VEEV antigen, indicating it may be induced directly or indirectly by VEEV infection. Therefore, while astrogliosis does occur during VEEV infection in vivo, whether VEEV infection of astrocytes influences astrogliosis and cell cycle progression in vivo has not been determined. In addition, the long-term impact of astrogliosis is unknown, which is especially important to determine as VEEV infection in humans leads to neurological sequelae in 4-14% of VEEV survivors (Ronca et al., 2016) . Based on our data, we speculated that astrogliosis would be inhibited in VEEV infected cells, as these cells would be severely limited in their ability to reenter the cell cycle. In contrast, VEEV infection of actively replicating astrocytes should lead to cell cycle arrest. In either case, these events would culminate in cell death in the majority of cells as VEEV infection induces cell death in a capsid dependent manner (Atasheva et al., 2010b) . While a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking has been implicated in VEEV capsid induced cell death (Atasheva et al., 2010b) , additional pathways altered prior to death have yet to be described. Our data demonstrate that VEEV infected cells are arrested in G1 with corresponding decreases in cyclin RNA and protein levels in a capsid dependent manner. These findings provide molecular insight into host pathway alterations that are triggered following VEEV infection, which may contribute to apoptosis.",

            "text": "Our data coupled with other previous findings led us to our model (Figure 7) where in VEEV infected cells, capsid binds to the host karyopherins CRM1 and importin \u03b1/\u03b21, blocking the nuclear pore complex and shutting down host transcription. Transcriptional suppression is directly correlated with the block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking although the exact mechanism is unknown (Garmashova et al., 2007; Lundberg et al., 2017) . Capsid mediates transcriptional suppression of cyclins (A, E, G, and B) and cdks (cdk1 and cdk2), due at least in part to the depletion of host cell import and export proteins (Figure 7) . Cyclin D1 protein expression and Rb phosphorylation (not shown on the model) are also impacted, which contribute to VEEV induced cell cycle arrest. Cyclin D1 expression is necessary for entry into G1 whereas cyclin E2 regulate the restriction point (G1/S checkpoint), which is the point in which the cell is committed to undergoing DNA replication (Vermeulen et al., 2003) . Cyclin A expression is needed during S phase to facilitate DNA replication (Vermeulen et al., 2003) . Therefore, decreased expression of all three of these cyclins severely limits the ability of VEEV infected cells to advance through the cell cycle. We hypothesize that transcriptional suppression of cyclins and cdk transcripts and the cell cycle delay could be influenced by this nucleocytoplasmic trafficking block, including reduced nuclear import of transcription factors or cell cycle regulators or decreased nuclear import of mitotic assembly factors. Future studies will explore these hypotheses and the importance of cell cycle alterations for VEEV pathogenesis.",
