In the present study we have reported a database of only experimentally verified peptide sequences, which exhibit molecular mimicry. The database is named as miPepBase (Mimicry Peptide Database) and contains comprehensive information about mimicry proteins and peptides of both host (and model organism) and pathogen. It also provides information about physicochemical properties of protein and mimicry peptides, which might be helpful in predicting the nature of protein and optimization of protein expression. The miPepBase can be searched using a keyword or, by autoimmune disease(s) or by a combination of host and pathogen taxonomic group or their name. To facilitate the search of proteins and/or epitope in miPepBase, which is similar to the user's interest, BLAST search tool is also incorporated. miPepBase is an open access database and available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/mipepbase.",

            "text": "Mimicry is a very common phenomenon in which a living being pretends to be what it is not. By adopting mimicry, an animal get protection by not hiding, rather being mistaken for something a predator will avoid because either it look dangerous or tastes bad. Hence, it is not surprising that similar strategy has been exploited at the molecular level as well. The obvious benefit molecular mimicry confers to pathogens is to fool the host's defenses and survive. The presence of a molecule in a pathogen that is similar with a host antigen could inhibit the immune response of the host against the pathogen because of the immune tolerance toward self-antigens (Davies, 1997; Gowthaman and Eswarakumar, 2013) . For example, Helicobacter pylori infection in human triggers two autoimmune diseases namely autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia. It occurs because activated CD4 + Th1 cells infiltrates into gastric mucosa and they cross-recognize the self-epitopes of H + K + ATPase and H. pylori antigens (D'Elios et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "There are number of well documented molecular mimicry events, using which bacteria, viruses, or parasites evade the host's immune response (Oldstone, 2005) . The pathogen's protein having similar epitope to that of the host results in cross-reactivity that generates immunological response against self (i.e., host), which ultimately leads to autoimmune diseases (Oldstone, 1998; Cusick et al., 2012) . The peptides, which display this property, are called mimicry peptides and the phenomenon is called molecular mimicry (Davies, 1997) . The role of molecular mimicry in autoimmune disease was getting strengthen when it was observed that the antibody against the phosphoprotein of measles virus and Herpes simplex type I can cross-react with human intermediate filament protein vimentin (Fujinami et al., 1983) . Molecular mimicry can cause several immune-mediated disease such as Grave's disease (Kohn et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001) , Insulin-dependent diabetes (Rose and Mackay, 2000; Hiemstra et al., 2001) , Multiple sclerosis (Banki et al., 1994; Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995; Appelmelk et al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1996; Rose and Mackay, 2000) , Peptic ulcer (Appelmelk et al., 1996) , Rheumatoid arthritis (Tiwana et al., 1999; Balandraud et al., 2004; Bridges, 2004) , Systemic lupus erythematosus (R\u00f6nnblom and Alm, 2001; Kaufman et al., 2003; McClain et al., 2005) , Myocarditis (Neu et al., 1987; Huber et al., 1994; Gauntt et al., 1995; Schulze and Schultheiss, 1995; Ang et al., 2004) , and cancer as well, by modulating key signaling pathways, such as those involving Ras (Guven-Maiorov et al., 2016) . A number of studies have deciphered various prospects and aspects of molecular mimicry, but these are scattered in numerous research papers. Compilation of the available information from literature can greatly facilitate the researchers who work in this domain. At present there is no data repository, which contains all the information related to autoimmune diseases caused due to molecular mimicry because piecing, together of this scattered data and discerning the accompanying details is complicated and tedious. To the best of our knowledge, only one database namely mimicDB (Ludin et al., 2011) is available which provides information about proteins or epitopes involved in host-pathogen interactions. But mimicDB is restricted to information pertaining to only a few human parasites. Also, the mimicry candidates of mimicDB were predicted through a computational pipeline.",

            "text": "In the present study we have reported a freely accessible database, which can serve as a comprehensive and high quality resource of peptides involved in molecular mimicry. We have also incorporated the information related to autoimmune diseases as well as in-depth information about mimicry peptide and proteins. The database is named, miPepBase (Mimicry Peptide Database), which is available at http:// proteininformatics.org/mkumar/mipepbase. All molecular mimicry based autoimmunity events compiled in miPepBase were experimentally verified by the respective researchers and are supported by peer-reviewed publications. MiPepBase is an open access database that provides comprehensive information about the mimicry proteins and peptides of both host (and model) and pathogen. The information includes the names of host and pathogen proteins, sequences of mimicry peptide, autoimmune disease caused due to mimicry peptide, gene ontology information of the protein, PDB ID of the structure of protein (if present), type of immunological response generated by mimicry peptide and much more. We anticipate that miPepBase will help researchers to generate new hypothesis about different aspects of molecular mimicry and also act as a unified resource of information about molecular mimicry. The miPepBase can be searched using keyword(s) or by autoimmune disease(s) or by a combination of host and pathogen taxonomic groups or their names. The database also includes BLAST search tool to facilitate sequence similarity search against the mimicry proteins and/or peptide contained in it. Each miPepBase entry is also linked to many popular global repositories such as UniProt (Apweiler et al., 2004) , PDB (Berman et al., 2000) , EMBL-EBI QuickGO (Binns et al., 2009) , and PubMed. MiPepBase also provides information about physicochemical properties of proteins containing mimicry peptides, which might be helpful in predicting the nature of protein and optimization of its expression. The basic architecture of miPepBase is shown in Figure 1 . The data of miPepBase can also be downloaded in text file. Overall, mimicry peptides which are compiled in miPepBase might help in opening new gateways to explore the role of molecular mimicry in autoimmune diseases that are yet unaddressed. It is anticipated that miPepBase would be helpful in understanding the details of molecular mimicry and expedite the process of disease detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and even deciding the therapeutic regimen of autoimmune diseases.",

The BLAST search option is available at menu bar ( Figure 3E ). The query sequence in FASTA format can either be pasted in the text box or uploaded as sequence file (Step e1). Three parameters have to be optimized for efficient BLAST search (i) the database in which related sequence will be searched; (ii) E-value, and (iii) Scoring Matrix. The default e-value and scoring matrix are 100 and BLOSUM 62, respectively (Step e2). As shown in section E, when P10809 protein sequence was searched against host protein database, total 13 hits were obtained which are arranged on the basis of ascending e-value (Step e3). Also every BLAST hit protein entry is further linked (in blue color) to detailed information page, which provide tabulated detailed information of corresponding BLAST hit (Step e4). These information are the same as described above for keyword search option (Step a4-a6).",

With the passage of time, number of autoimmune diseases caused due to molecular mimicry is increasing. Since, a unified repository of the available information related to molecular mimicry based autoimmune diseases is not available, hence we have built a database (miPepBase) which not only contains the information regarding proteins and peptides associated with the process, but several other important details also. In-depth analysis of this information might lead to the elucidation of mechanisms of autoimmune diseases controlled by mimicry peptides. Each entry in the miPepBase database is linked to many other molecular biology data repositories. Further, the database also includes inbuilt tools, which can help to fetch other relevant information related to the mimicry proteins and peptides. As more data will accumulate by the use of high throughput molecular, genomic and metagenomic methods, we anticipate that the release of miPepBase will facilitate comprehensive analyses of different factors involved in autoimmune diseases caused by the mimicry peptides. We also hope that miPepBase would be helpful for the scientific community in understanding the host-pathogen interactions, as well as how the pathogens evade host immune systems.",

These epitopes were predicted to be a potential molecular mimicry peptide and derived from a computational prediction pipeline. Further mimicDB is focused on a few selected human endoparasites namely Brugia malayi, Schistosoma mansoni, Plasmodium falciparum, Leshmania major, Cryptosporidium parvum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Trypanosoma cruzi. In miPepBase the information is not restricted to any particular class of pathogen and/or disease. It contains information related to all autoimmune diseases caused by pathogens, which may belong to viruses, or prokaryotes, or eukaryotes. miPepBase host's and pathogen's mimicry peptides were curated from literature. The respective researchers have already experimentally established the role of these mimicry epitopes in generating autoimmune disease.",

It is certainly possible that few peptides might have been missed and not included in the miPepBase. In future, we would make our best efforts to include the missing as well as newly added data in miPepBase. The motivation behind establishment of miPepBase was to establish a knowledgebase for proteins/peptides involved in molecular mimicry. We will continue to add new information, which may include but not limited to interaction partners of mimicry proteins and their role in disease. This will enable us to provide a platform for study of the mimicry peptides and pathways through which they trigger autoimmune diseases.
