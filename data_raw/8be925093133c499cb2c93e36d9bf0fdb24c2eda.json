The outbreak of the latter in West Africa in 2014-2015 was unprecedented in terms of its scale and consequence, and was responsible for the deaths of more than 11,000 people. The emergence of Zika virus in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015-2016, meanwhile, has demonstrated that weaknesses in public health preparedness and response capabilities were neither unique to West Africa nor to EVD, and reiterate the need for renewed focus on these aspects of global health protection [2] .",

Their stated purpose and scope was 'to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade'. Although the IHR are aimed at several areas of public health security they can be broadly summarized into two main areas; Urgent actions to be taken with respect to acutely arising risks to public health and Strengthening of national systems and infrastructure (core capacities) While Ireland has no direct flights from the affected countries in West Africa, a significant number of travelers who leave that area arrive in Ireland as their final destination. At least 11,000 people travelled from the region to the UK alone between September and December 2014, for example, and it can be expected that a reasonable number travelled onwards to Ireland. In addition, Ireland also had to contend with significant numbers of returning humanitarian aid workers from the region; between December 2014 and November 2015, 83 of these workers returned to Ireland from their posts in West Africa.",

Rusal Aughinish in County Limerick, for example, is Europe's largest bauxite refinery. Bauxite is used to make aluminium and Guinea was the sixth largest global producer in 2012 [3] . Ireland is a key export market for Guinea, with over $90 million worth of bauxite imported from there annually. The shipping traffic to Ireland from West Africa was therefore significant, with at least 44 ships arriving at Irish ports between August 2014 and May 2015, having previously called at ports in the affected countries.",
