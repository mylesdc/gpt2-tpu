Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation PLOS ONE | Conclusion Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice.

Other triggers are cold air, smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and viral infection [1] [2] [3] [4] . Several viral infections induce asthma exacerbation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are known to be major causes of asthma exacerbations in children [5] [6] [7] . Infection with these viruses in infants was associated with a higher incidence of asthma onset [8, 9] . The prevalence of virus detection in adult asthmatic exacerbation was reported to the range of 41-78% [10] . Among these viruses, HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold [11] HRV infection causes asthma due to its potential for a Th2-biased response [12, 13] . Influenza virus (IF) infection also induces asthma attacks in adults [10, 14] . The prevalence of IF infection with asthmatic exacerbation in adults is higher than that in children [10] . However, whether other viruses induce asthma exacerbations in adults remains unknown.",

Even in the recent guidelines, there is few description of the association between bacterial infection and asthma [1] [2] [3] . In this study, infection with S. pneumoniae was the risk factor for adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. The current guideline was developed using an evidence-based medicine analysis, which utilized several clinical studies. Patients with a heavy smoking history or comorbid COPD or pneumonia were usually excluded in almost all of the clinical asthma studies. However, many asthmatic inpatients have a history of heavy smoking and some have comorbid COPD or pneumonia in clinical practice. The results of the present study are useful for many practicing clinicians because the patients in the present study were not all non-smoking uncomplicated asthmatics. It was found that viral infection, especially with IF, RSV, and HRV, was important for asthma exacerbation. These results are consistent with previous reports [5] [6] [7] 14] . Surprisingly, viruses were detected by multiplex PCR analysis in half of the stable asthmatic outpatients, indicating that several viruses were the common human respiratory microbes. Compared to stable asthmatic outpatients, higher incidences of HRV, RSV, and metapneumovirus infections were observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients, indicating that viral infection, especially with HRV, RSV, or metapneumovirus, plays an important role in adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Prevention of infections with these viruses is important for decreasing asthma exacerbations in clinical practice. The relationship between viral infection and asthma exacerbation may be explained by TLR or ICAM-1 [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , but a higher incidence of smoking may affect viral infection in asthmatic patients in clinical practice.",

In the present study, there was a relationship between bacterial infection and asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Considering the results of this practical, clinical study, comorbid sinusitis may be the most important factor related to susceptibility to bacterial infection in asthmatic patients. The presence of comorbid pneumonia may also affect the susceptibility of asthmatic patients to bacterial infection. Although S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis are the major bacterial infections in the respiratory tract, only H. influenzae was detected from stable asthmatic outpatients. These results indicate that bacteria other than H. influenzae contributed to asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Early treatment with antibiotics, as well as steroid and bronchodilators, may be required for treatment of asthma exacerbation in these patients. It is important for clinicians to detect and treat bacterial infections in patients with asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. In the view point of the prevention of bacterial infection, pneumococcal vaccination is most important for asthmatic patients. Co-infections with virus and bacteria were observed in 18.8% of asthma attack patients in this study. Wark et al. reported that the viral and bacterial co-infections increased the risk of readmission in asthmatic and COPD patients [14] . This is an important issue when taking care of these asthmatic patients.",

            "text": "The exacerbation group had a higher number of smokers versus the stable asthmatics in our study. The mechanism of this result may be explained by steroid resistance (via the histone deacetylase 2 pathway or overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor \u03b2) in severe smoking asthma. [29, 30] There are some limitations in this study. Although 98% of asthma exacerbation inpatients had a history of a common cold before their asthma attack, a pathogen was detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in only 70% of patients. Overall, 15 major viruses and 6 major bacteria were evaluated by multiplex PCR analysis. It is possible that other minor pathogens may be involved in asthma exacerbations in clinical practice. Another possible reason for the low yield is inappropriate timing of the taking of nasal swabs. The pathogen causing the common cold may have disappeared at the time the nasal swab was taken in some patients. Another reason is that some patients may have only had a lower respiratory tract infection. The symptom from the patients with allergic rhinitis may be misinterpreted as being due to a respiratory infection. Furthermore, this study is not a result from longitudinal data. We checked the microbes only once on admission. If we check the microbes several times, we can clearly elucidate whether the detected microbe is infection or colonization. Several pathogens were different between stable outpatients and asthma exacerbation inpatients. However, only the detection rate of S. pneumoniae was statisitically significant because the number of stable outpatients was too small compared to asthma exacerbation inpatients. If we could get the larger number of outpatients, other pathogen may be related to asthma exacerbation.",
