The second PCR was performed using external forward (GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT) and reverse (GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT) primers which included the external parts of the attB1 and attB2 recombination sites. The resulting PCR-fragments, flanked by complete attB1 and attB2 sites, were cloned by BP-clonase into the gentamycin resistant entry vector pDONR207 (Gateway, Invitrogen). Viral proteins containing transmembrane domains were cloned both as full length and fragments.",

Yeast cells were incubated for 1 h in 750 \u00b5l PEG/Bicine solution (40 % PEG 1000, 200 mM Bicine pH 8.35) at 30\u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 45\u00b0C. Subsequently, the yeast was pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml NPbuffer (0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Bicine pH 8.35), pelleted a second time and resuspended in 200 \u00b5l NP-buffer and plated on to SD medium (+2 % agar) lacking either leucine (leu) (prey) or tryptophane (trp) (bait). Colonies were visible after 2-3 days. The yeast strains AH109 and Y187 expressing prey and bait proteins were arrayed in 96-deep-well plates with SD liquid media lacking leu or trp. A liquid bait culture was transferred onto SD medium plates lacking trp and the prey arrays were transferred onto the same plates for mating, using either a 384-pin replica tool (Nunc) or a Biomek 2000 workstation (Beckman-Coulter). Diploid colonies were grown for 2 days at 30\u00b0C and subsequently transferred to selective SD -leu-trp-his plates. Interactions were considered positive if at least 3 out of 4 colonies grew. A second reporter was not used as Braun and colleaguesrecently reported that this can reduce sensitivity without increasing specificity[4]. The cellular genes c-myc (pGBKT7) and max (pGADT7) were included as a positive control, while empty pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors were used as negative controls. Viral proteins acting as self-activating baits were analyzed on increasing amounts of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) (3 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM) and excluded from the results if no clear positive interactions could be determined[5].",
