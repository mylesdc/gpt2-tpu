            "text": "Several studies have shown a reduced efficacy of influenza vaccines in the elderly compared to young adults. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a commercially available inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone 1 ) in young adult and aged mice. C57/BL6 mice were administered a single or double immunization of Fluzone 1 with or without CpG and challenged intranasally with H1N1 A/California/09 virus. A double immunization of Fluzone 1 adjuvanted with CpG elicited the highest level of protection in young adult mice which was associated with increases in influenza specific IgG, elevated HAI titres, reduced viral titres and lung inflammation. In contrast, the vaccine schedule which provided fully protective immunity in young adult mice conferred limited protection in aged mice. Antigen presenting cells from aged mice were found to be less responsive to in vitro stimulation by Fluzone and CpG which may partially explain this result. Our data are supportive of studies that have shown limited effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the elderly and provide important information relevant to the design of more immunogenic vaccines in this age group.",

Those at most risk from complications include young children, pregnant women, asthma sufferers, immune compromised individuals and the elderly. The elderly account for up to 80% of hospitalisations and 95% of influenza associated mortality [2] . To help reduce these severe outcomes, public health authorities recommend that individuals over 65 should receive yearly influenza vaccination. However, several clinical trials and cohort studies have reported low rates of vaccine efficacy in the elderly, as judged by statistically significant reductions in influenza associated hospitalisation rates or seroconversion post vaccination [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

From human and animal studies, it is known that aging is associated with decreased responses to innate immune stimuli and abnormal production of various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In addition, immune cells from older subjects have a number of signalling defects, slower rates of dendritic cell migration, activation and compromised antigen presentation [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, antibody production and antibody half-life is diminished in the aged and the available T-cell repertoire is diminished due to thymic involution, as well as the number of total naive T-cell and B lymphocytes in the elderly [20] [21] [22] [23] . All of these factors are likely to account for decreased vaccine responses in older individuals, since vaccines rely on a fully functional immune system to generate protective immune memory.",

Influenza vaccines administered with the squalene based M59 adjuvant generated higher seroprotection rates in people over 60 [24, 25] . The Fluzone High-Dose vaccine formulation made by Sanofi Pasteur which contains four times the active antigen content as in the conventional vaccine received by young adults, increased seroconversion rates from 30% to 50% to H1N1 in the elderly [26] . Pica et. al also showed that a higher dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine is necessary to induce protective immunity in aged mice compared to young adult mice [27] . Also in mice, administering alum or Poly I:C with an influenza vaccine substantially increased survival in older animals [28] . The use of replication incompetent vaccine vectors derived from Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus carrying influenza transgenes protected aged mice from lethal homologous and heterologous influenza challenge [29] . These findings indicate that despite age associated immune atrophy, it is possible to partially rescue vaccine efficacy in the elderly by augmenting the innate immune response either with higher antigen doses, co-stimulation, priming or the use of adjuvants [30] .",

Analysis of serum 4 weeks post vaccination showed that H1N1 specific IgG was detectable; however, no hemagglutination inhibition activity (HAI <5) was observed (Table 1) . When challenged with H1N1 A/California/09 influenza virus, these mice experienced weight loss similar to unvaccinated controls ( Fig 1A) and 100% mortality ( Fig 1B) . We wanted to investigate whether a well characterized innate immune TLR9 agonist (CpG) could improve the immunogenicity and the efficacy of FZ in this model. Four weeks after immunization, young adult mice immunized with FZ+CpG had H1N1 specific IgG titres over 3 times greater compared to FZ alone (Table 1 ) and had detectable HAI activity equivalent to a 16 fold increase post vaccination (HAI = 80) ( Table 1 ). This increased serum IgG and HAI activity was associated with a decrease in peak weight loss following infection followed by full recovery (Fig 1A) , with improved clinical scores as judged by increased activity and less fur ruffling (data not shown). Furthermore, mortality in the unvaccinated and unadjuvanted (FZ) groups reached 100% following infection compared to only 20% in the adjuvanted (FZ+CpG) group (Fig 1B) .",

However, unlike young adult mice, the addition of a CpG adjuvant (FZ+CpG) did not show either an increase in Influenza A virus (IAV) specific IgG titre or HAI activity when compared to FZ alone (Table 1) .

Despite this, both vaccinated and unvaccinated aged mice succumbed to H1N1 infection with 100% mortality in those groups (Fig 1D) .

CpG has been shown to act as an adjuvant by stimulating innate responses in antigen presenting cells (APC) which first encounter the vaccine. Previous work has already shown that TNF\u03b1 release is compromised in vitro and in response to influenza virus infection in aged mice [32, 33] . Similarly MHC class II expression is lower in response to IAV, in cells from older adults [34] . We stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) from both young adult and aged mice in vitro with FZ or FZ+CpG and examined TNF-\u03b1 production and MHC class II cell surface expression (S1 Fig). BMM from young adult mice upregulated MHC class II in response to FZ and FZ+CpG with minimal up regulation to CpG alone (Fig 2A) . TNF-\u03b1 levels were low when stimulated with FZ alone but were significantly boosted in the presence of CpG (Fig 2B) . By contrast, BMM from aged mice had comparatively low MHC class II up regulation in response to FZ, and no detectable up regulation in the presence of CpG (Fig 2A) . Interestingly TNF-\u03b1 production was similar in BMM from young adult and aged mice (Fig 2B) . BMDCs from young adult mice were also responsive to activation by FZ, CpG alone and FZ+CpG, showing strong up regulation of MHC class II and TNF-\u03b1 release (Fig 2C and 2D) . The highest TNF-\u03b1 concentration was measured in cells stimulated with FZ+CpG ( Fig 2D) . There was minimal MHCII up regulation by BMDC derived from aged mice (Fig 2C) . Additionally there was a significant reduction in TNF-\u03b1 in the FZ+CpG samples compared to BMDC from young adult mice ( Fig  2D) . Taken together, we found that APCs derived from aged mice were less activated when stimulated in vitro with either FZ or FZ+CpG, compared to cells from young adult mice.",

            "text": "In previous experiments, we demonstrated that the co-administration of CpG+FZ improved antibody responses and protection from H1N1 IAV in young adult but not aged mice. We wanted to investigate whether the addition of a second vaccination would add further benefit in young adult mice and lead to some protection in aged mice. Young adult mice were vaccinated with FZ alone or FZ+CpG at 6 weeks and 2 weeks before challenge with A/California/09 H1N1 virus. Our data indicate after a double CpG adjuvanted immunization (FZ+CpG) x2, young adult mice were fully protected from H1N1 IAV associated weight loss and mortality (Fig 3A and 3B) . Conversely, the group that received two immunizations with FZ alone still experienced substantial weight loss and 80% group mortality. Four weeks after primary immunization, young adult mice in the FZ+CpG group had significantly higher levels of anti-H1N1 IgG compared to FZ alone, which is consistent with our findings. After the second immunization, both groups, (FZ+CpG) x2 and FZ x2, had comparable levels of IAV-specific IgG. However, HAI antibody levels were two times higher in the adjuvanted vs. the non-adjuvanted group (40 vs. 20) (Table 1) . We next wanted to determine if some of the benefits related to the immunization with a second dose in young adult mice could be seen in aged mice. In two separate experiments, aged mice were vaccinated at -6 and -2 weeks prior to challenge with A/California/09 H1N1virus in an identical manner to young adult mice. As the number aged mice available to us was limited, we compared only the most protective vaccine schedule (FZ+CpG \u00c3 2) in young adult and aged mice. Fig 3C shows that some aged mice within the vaccinated groups showed a decrease in body mass loss following A/California/09 H1N1 infection, resulting in reduced weight loss and recovery thereafter. However, all mice showed some degree of weight loss and the overall group survival was only 60% (Fig 3D) . Thus, the same vaccine formulation and immunization schedule which resulted in symptomless (asymptomatic) infection in young adult mice gave a more modest level of protection in aged mice. This benefit may have been due to cell mediated responses induced by vaccination since no HAI activity was detected.",

Fig 4A shows that young adult mice immunized twice with FZ+CpG have a reduced influx of neutrophils present in the lungs at day 7 post infection compared to unvaccinated mice and mice vaccinated twice with FZ alone (p<0.007). A reduction in lung neutrophilia is generally a sign of reduced local inflammation and immunopathology. Both vaccinated groups had a higher percentage of CD4+ cells present in the lung after infection, relative to unvaccinated controls (not shown). However only mice immunized twice with FZ+CpG had a significantly higher percentage of CD8+ T-cells in the lung following infection (Fig 4B) . Finally, we assessed viral burden in the lungs and found that mice immunized twice with FZ+CpG had lower viral titres compared to mice immunized twice with FZ and the unvaccinated controls (Fig 4C) .

Young adult mice were asymptomatic and protected to an H1N1 live-virus challenge after a second dose of Fluzone and CpG which were associated with increases in influenza specific IgG, elevated HAI titres, reduced viral titres and lung inflammation. In contrast, the benefits were more modest in aged mice. All immunization protocols with or without adjuvant resulted in poorer protection in aged compared to young adult mice. Strikingly, the same immunization schedule (FZ+CpG) x2 doses which conferred full protection in young adult mice resulted in only partial protection (60% survival) and no HAI activity in aged mice. APC from older mice showed diminished responses to FZ alone and to FZ+CpG, which may in part account for the low vaccine efficacy. It is possible that aged mice have a higher susceptibility to IAV than young mice, but it would be difficult to extricate increased susceptibility from a diminished immune response. Other groups have found similar low responses to purified HA and CpG in aging humans [37, 38] . Interestingly, we found that following adjuvanted vaccination, young adult and aged mice develop similar amounts of anti-influenza specific IgG in the serum, but only sera from young adult mice tested positive in HAI assays, suggesting that perhaps antibody quality may be compromised in older mice. Studies have reported that antibodies from aged individuals have a shorter lifespan and lower affinities [3, 39] .",

In future studies it would be desirable to expand the panel to other antibody isotypes and functions, which may reveal age associated differences in influenza-specific IgG functions. Though results were more striking in young adult mice, our data did show a modest benefit from a two dose immunization regimen and the use of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in aged mice. Our results are consistent with medium sized trials which have shown that an MF59 adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluad) had much stronger immunogenicity in patients over 65 years old, generating higher anti-IAV titres post vaccination and faster seroconversion times [40, 41] . Similarly MF59 adjuvanted Fluad induced higher HAI titres and longer antibody persistence in infants and young children [42] .",
