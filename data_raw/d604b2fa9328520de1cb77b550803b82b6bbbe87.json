The test presents an alternative format of influenza virus molecular testing that utilizes isothermal amplification and visual detection of nucleic acid on a test strip. The entire test procedure (extraction, amplification, and detection) is integrated into an enclosed semiautomated system. Analytically, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detects 95 and 85 copies of viral genomes for influenza A and B viruses, respectively, with no cross-reactivity observed against other common respiratory pathogens. The clinical performance was established by blind testing of 328 nasal/throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the United Kingdom and Belgium and comparing the results with the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method routinely used in two public health laboratories. The SAMBA Flu duplex test showed a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for influenza virus A and 100% and 100% for influenza virus B. The test provides a new technology that could facilitate simple and timely identification of influenza virus infection, potentially resulting in more efficient control measures.",

In the United States alone, seasonal epidemic influenza has been estimated to result in 31 million outpatient visits and an annual total economic burden of $87 billion (1, 2) . The elderly, children, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality caused by influenza virus infection (3, 4) . Furthermore, emerging influenza virus strains have the potential of sustaining efficient human-tohuman transmission and causing a global pandemic, such as the recent outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (5) . In terms of treatment options, neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are currently the first-line influenza virus antiviral drugs. NI administration is recommended during the early phase of the disease (between 24 and 72 h after illness onset), when the replication of influenza virus peaks (6) . At a community level, timely implementation of patient isolation and social distancing measures, including school closures, have been shown to reduce viral transmission (7, 8) . The control of influenza virus infection highlights the critical role of an efficient diagnostic assay that enables prompt identification of an infected person and the initiation of subsequent disease management.",

            "text": "At present, there is a wide range of techniques available to achieve different levels of diagnosis, including serology, conventional virus culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, rapid immunoassay (rapid test), and nucleic acid test (NAT). Serology and virus culture involve lengthy laboratory processes (2 to 14 days) that render these methods unsuitable for rapid clinical diagnosis (9, 10) . R-mix cultures have been widely used for the de-tection of influenza viruses, with an improved turnaround time of 1 to 2 days (11, 12) . DFA, although it significantly reduces the turnaround time to 2 to 6 h, is generally less sensitive than virus culture and requires trained personnel to perform and interpret results (13, 14) . Rapid tests for influenza virus based on viral antigen detection by lateral flow immunochromatographic dipstick assay have become widely used in point-of-care settings, such as emergency rooms, doctors' clinics, etc. Rapid tests are userfriendly and can be performed with minimal training without the requirement of complex equipment. In terms of turnaround time, rapid tests confer the highest efficiency, with the results known within 10 to 15 min. However, it has been shown that rapid tests exhibit inconsistent test performance, especially in the detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (15) (16) (17) (18) . Due to the limitations of the rapid immunoassays and the increasing availability of molecular technologies, a number of molecular assays for in-house research and diagnostic use have become available (14, 19) . The majority of the molecular tests are based on real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and require trained operators and specialized equipment for the extraction and amplification steps (20) (21) (22) (23) . In addition, the cost and unavailability of centralized testing pose a significant threat to the control of influenza virus in resource-limited settings.",

The test, the SAMBA Flu duplex test, couples isothermal amplification with visual detection of nucleic acid on the dipstick to allow a simple and sensitive diagnosis of influenza virus A and B infections. Clinical samples. A total of 328 samples were collected from two institutions (described below) for the clinical evaluation. The samples were all surplus samples left from routine respiratory testing. The clinical results and patient details were initially blinded to the operators of the SAMBA Flu duplex test. These samples were in two groups: (i) 41 prospectively collected mixed nasal/throat swab specimens collected between 7 March and 5 April 2012 from the Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Health Protection Agency (HPA), Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and (ii) 287 archived nasopharyngeal swab specimens provided by the Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP), Brussels, Belgium. These samples were submitted to WIV-ISP for testing during and between influenza seasons from 2010 to 2012. Out of these 219 positive archived samples (124 influenza A virus positive and 95 influenza B virus positive), 8 had threshold cycles (C T ) of \u054635 (3.7%), 30 had a C T between 30 and \u03fd35 (13.7%), 72 had a C T of 25 to \u03fd30 (32.9%), 99 had a C T of 20 to \u03fd25 (45.2%), and 10 had a C T of \u03fd20 (4.6%) (C T values were provided by WIV-ISP after SAMBA testing). For both groups (from the United Kingdom and from Brussels), screening and confirmatory data were retrospectively available.",

RNA transcripts containing the influenza A/B virus conserved sequences targeted by SAMBA were produced for use in the quantification of cultured viruses. In summary, cDNAs of A/Brisbane/59/2007 and B/Florida/4/ 2006 were generated from RNA extract by using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom). Amplicons of influenza A/B virus sequences chosen as targets for the SAMBA Flu duplex test were amplified by primer sets (for influenza A virus, A.M-F, 5=-GCATTITGGACAAAICGTCTAC-3=, and A.M-R, 5=-C TAAAGACAAGACCAATICTGTCA-3=; for influenza B virus, B.NS-F, 5=-CATCTTCTTCATCCTCCACTGTAA-3= and B.NS-R, 5=-GGATACA AGTCCTTATCAACTCTGC-3=) flanking the conserved regions using Hot Master Taq polymerase (5 Prime). The 113-bp (influenza A virus) and 131-bp (influenza B virus) amplicons were purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by cloning into the pCRII vector using a TA cloning kit dual promoter (with the pCRII vector; Invitrogen). Influenza A/B virus plasmids were transformed into One Shot TOP 10F= chemically competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen) and purified by using a QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) before the orientation of insert was confirmed by sequencing with the primers M13 forward (5=-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3=) and M13 reverse (5=-CAGGAAAC AGCTATGAC-3=). Plasmids with the correct insert sequence were selected to produce PCR amplicons by using M13 forward and reverse primers followed by PCR purification. The purified amplicons were quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 system (Thermo Scientific), and the recommended amount of amplicons was transcribed in vitro with a MEGAshortscript T7 kit (influenza A virus) or MEGAscript SP6 kit (influenza B virus; Ambion, Paisley, United Kingdom). The transcripts were purified using a MEGAclear kit (Ambion), and their concentrations (in ng/l) were determined by using the NanoDrop system. Finally, the number of copies per microliter for each preparation of transcript was calculated according to the following formula: RNA amount (in copy/l) \u03ed [(RNA concentration, in ng/l) \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 /molecular weight of RNA (in g/mol)] \u03eb (6.022 \u03eb 10 23 copies/mole).

Our previously reported generic quadriplex assay (25, 26) was upgraded for this study to a pentaplex assay capable of detecting all influenza A virus subtypes, influenza B virus, the hemagglutinin A(H1)pdm09 and H3 subtypes, and bacteriophage MS2, and it was performed essentially as outlined in reference 25, with the following modifications. The hemagglutinin H5 subtype primers and probe were replaced with A(H1)pdm09 hemagglutinin-specific primers and probe, H1F, 5=-TCAACAGACACTGTAGACACAGTACT-3=; H1R, 5=-GTTTCCCGTTATGCTTGTCTTCTAG-3=; H1p, Cy5-5=-AATGTAA CAGTAACACACTCTGTTAACC-3=-BHQ, with the primer concentrations both at 0.4 M and the probe at 0.12 M. An additional set of hemagglutinin primers and probe for H3 seasonal influenza virus was also included, namely, AH3F, 5=-CCTTTTTGTTGAACGCAGCAA-3=, AH3R, 5=-CGGATGAGGCAACTAGTGACCTA-3=, and H3p, VIC-5=-C CTACAGCAACTGTTACC-3=-MGBNFQ, and the primers and probe concentrations were again at 0.4 M and 0.12 M, respectively. The generic influenza A virus matrix probe (VIC-5=-TCYTGTCACCTCTGAC-3=-MGBNFQ) was replaced with another generic probe, namely, FAM-5=-CCCCTCAAAGCCGA-3=-MGBNFQ, and used at the same concentration (0.16 M) along with the AMF primer (0.4 M) and AMR primer (0.8 M) as previously reported (25) . The reporter label (Cy5) on the influenza B virus probe (BNP probe) was converted to Quasar 705, by accessing the fifth channel (crimson) on the Rotorgene 6000 instrument and creating a pentaplex assay. The concentrations of primers (BNP-F and BNP-R) and the Quasar 705 probe for the influenza virus B component of the assay were, however, increased to 0.2 M and 0.08 M, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophage internal control (IC) component was identical to that described previously (25) , with the primers (MS2 F1 and MS2 R1) and ROX-labeled MS2 probe concentrations each at 0.08 M. The pentaplex assay was performed with the use of the SuperScript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR enzyme (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) in a reaction volume of 25 l (containing 3 mM MgSO 4 ) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument. The amplification conditions were incubation at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Fluorescence was measured for each of the five channels at the end of each cycle. The upgraded pentaplex assay was then subjected to a program of validation to assess its performance before allowing it to supersede our quadriplex assay (25) as our laboratory's front-line diagnostic test. Briefly, 125 routine clinical respiratory specimens, comprising 50 influenza virus A-positive (38 H3N2 and 12 H1N1pdm09), 10 influenza B virus-positive, and 65 negative specimens were processed by both real-time assays in parallel. Concordant results were obtained with both assays for the influenza A and influenza B virus-positive specimens and negative specimens, with the pentaplex assay providing additional typing data for influenza A virus positives, i.e., distinguishing (H1N1)pdm09 from H3N2 isolates. The C T values for the comparable components (generic influenza A and B viruses) of both assays were broadly similar. However, the 12 A(H1N1)pdm09 samples gave a consistently lower C T value, between 1 and 1.5, with the pentaplex assay. The performance of both assays was also assessed using a number of external quality assessment (EQA) panels: the QCMD 2011 influenza hemagglutinin typing EQA program (14 samples) and the QCMD 2011 influenza A and B RNA EQA program (12 samples), obtained from Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (www.qcmd .org). The annual HPA Influenza Molecular Proficiency Panel 7 (for 2012), containing 14 samples, was also subjected to both assays in parallel. Both assays delivered a 100% score with the three EQA panels, giving concordant results for the common influenza A and B virus components. The quadriplex assay was, however, able to type the H5 samples, while the pentaplex assay could distinguish and type the H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 samples in the panels, in line with their defining assay attributes. Serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA extracted from virus stocks of A/Solomon Island/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Panama/ 45/90 were analyzed by both real-time assays, and their limits of detection were determined to be identical. The analytical sensitivity of the pentaplex assay was calculated using serial dilutions of plasmid constructs containing the matrix gene of A/PR/8/34 (PR8) and the nucleoprotein gene target site of B/Florida/4/2006, and it was found to be \u03f35 and 15 genome equivalents per PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respectively.",

Coincidentally, the initial design of SAMBA Flu A primers overlapped with the CDC universal influenza A virus primers by 63.6% (forward) and 75% (reverse) (27) . The CDC influenza A virus primers were therefore modified and adapted for SAMBA as one of the tentative primer sets for evaluation. This primer set (A-F and A-R), which amplified a 106-nucleotide (nt) target region of the influenza A virus M gene, was eventually selected. Influenza B virus primer set (B-F and B-R) was designed to target a 109-nt conserved region of the influenza B virus NS gene, whereas the IC primer set (IC-F and IC-R) amplifies a 102-nt region of the MS2 phage genome, which showed no sequence similarity with known human pathogens. The T7 promoter with a linker sequence (5=-AATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA AGG-3=) was added to the 5= end of these three reverse primers.

Four samples tested influenza A positive by SAMBA but negative by qRT-PCR, and two samples tested negative by SAMBA but influenza B positive by qRT-PCR (C T values of 37.97 and 37.86). To resolve the discrepancy and to prevent any testing bias, these six discordant samples were blind tested alongside 10% of the concordant ones (randomly selected; 38 in total), using twostep typing/subtyping real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza A(H3), A(H1N1)pdm09, former seasonal H1N1, and influenza B viruses routinely used for influenza surveillance at PHE Colindale. The 32 concordant samples gave the same results as SAMBA (and the comparator qRT-PCR) by the PHE real-time assays. Four influenza A virus SAMBA-positive qRT-PCR-negative samples tested negative, and two influenza B virus SAMBA-negative qRT-PCR-positive samples also tested negative. In summary, through the analysis of 328 clinical specimens, the SAMBA showed a resolved clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for its influenza A virus test and a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% for its influenza B virus test ( Table 3 ). The performance between the prospective study, although small in sample size, and the retrospective study was similar. Notably, out of these test, only one sample from Belgium initially gave an invalid result. Upon repeat, this sample tested negative (concordant). This gave an invalid rate of 0.3%. The SAMBA Flu duplex test detected almost all the positive cases (97.4% [227/233]) with a clearly visible signal (\u05463), even in samples with low viral load (C T \u0546 30). In the six samples (2.6%) showing a low dipstick signal, two had a very low viral load (SAMBA ID 52, with SAMBA signal of 1, C T of 37.05, and SAMBA ID C4, with SAMBA signal of 1 and C T of 34.83), and the other four were later confirmed (resolved by qRT-PCR and also retested by SAMBA) to be false positives, possibly due to degradation of the viral genome in the original samples or contamination during the extraction process. A weak negative correlation was observed between the signal strength of the SAMBA test and the C T values from the qRT-PCR assays (r \u03ed \u03ea0.35; P \u03fd 0.0001).",

Rapid and accurate diagnostic testing close to the source is important for the control of outbreaks and detection of emerging influenza viruses. The correlation between the efficacy (31) (32) (33) (34) . These assays simplify the technical manual steps of molecular testing by use of an automated device. Nevertheless, due to the use of real-time PCR technology, these assays require specialized equipment and software for sample processing and data interpretation. The SAMBA Flu duplex test described in this study utilizes isothermal amplification and visual dipstick detection of viral nucleic acid (amplification product) to further reduce the complexity of molecular testing. An internal control based on bacteriophage MS2 was also integrated into the test to monitor the entire test procedure, from extraction to detection. Analytically, the assay was able to detect 95 and 85 copies/test (380 and 340 copies/ml) of influenza A and B viruses, respectively. The SAMBA also demonstrated a promising clinical performance that was comparable to the routine qRT-PCR used in two national reference laboratories (Table 3 ). In addition, the test was shown to be analytically specific against common respiratory pathogens and was found to be reactive to over 20 different subtypes/strains of influenza A/B viruses. In the rare event of influenza A and B virus coinfection, the SAMBA Flu duplex test was capable of detecting both viruses when their viral loads were within a 100-fold difference of each other. Evaluation of a new assay in a blinded manner is directly linked to the validity of the claimed test performance. Indeed, a significant quality concern over rapid tests for influenza virus is their failure to report whether the clinical evaluation was conducted in a blinded fashion (35) . For the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex tests, the clinical samples were tested blind, including the testing of archived samples from WIV-ISP, Belgium. During the 2011-2012 winter in England, influenza virus activity was low, and the H3N2 subtype (A/Perth/16/2009-like virus) was the dominant strain, out-competing both the A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses. For this reason, retrospective archived swab samples, collected by WIV-ISP, Belgium, from 2010 to 2012 (including between-season months), were used to supplement the small number of prospectively collected samples obtained in Cambridge. This ensured that the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex test was not limited to the diagnosis of the H3N2 subtype. In total, the SAMBA test showed promising performance (\u03fe97% sensitivity and specificity for influenza A and B viruses detection compared to the routine qRT-PCR used by two national reference laboratories) in this population of clinical samples. The invalid rate (no IC and test signal and required repeat of the entire test procedure) was found to be 0.3% (1/328). As a comparison, invalid testing due to failure of the internal control was reported to be 5.7% (of 192 samples) for the Prodesse ProFlu\u03e9 assay, and 3.5% (of 202 samples) was reported for the for xTAG RVP test (36, 37) .",

            "text": "The novelty of an influenza virus rapid test is its feature allowing the test result to be interpreted by eye on the dipstick. Such visual detection, intended to improve the usability in near-patient diagnosis, might result in diminished test sensitivity if the dipstick signal for a positive sample is not easily distinguishable from that for negative cases by the operator. Stevenson and Loeffelholz reported weak dipstick signal intensity in nearly 43% of the positive pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 samples tested using the QuickVue Influenza A\u03e9B test (38) . The large proportion of weak positive results could adversely affect the overall test performance due to operator-dependent error in identifying the weak signal as positive. The principle of the SAMBA test takes advantage of the explosive accumulation (10 9 -fold increase in 1 to 2 h) of singlestranded amplification product by isothermal amplification in conjunction with the finely adjusted amplification/detection formulation and high yield of viral RNA purification, to achieve an \"all-or-none\" signal profile, i.e., a positive test signal was almost always visibly strong (\u05463 signal) (39) . This all-or-none feature (reflected in the weak correlation between the dipstick signal and C T value, r \u03ed \u03ea0.35 and P \u03fd 0.0001) of the SAMBA Flu duplex test greatly minimized the ambiguity of test interpretation. As for the IC signal of the SAMBA Flu duplex test, all negative samples gave a strong IC signal (\u03fe4), although only 29.2% (68/233) of the positive samples gave an IC signal of \u05463. The lower IC signal for the positives could be related to the assay being optimized in favor of the amplification of the influenza virus targets (in order to achieve high test sensitivity). This could be remedied by retitration of input of the IC at the extraction step and/or the IC primer in the amplification mix. Nevertheless, the IC system developed here was effective in indicating true-negative results by giving strong IC signals, and the presence of the IC signal is not required for strong influenza virus-positive cases (a separate negative run was always included to monitor the amplification of the IC). In terms of the turnaround time, the SAMBA Flu duplex test currently takes 2 h and 15 min for the entire test procedure. Compared to other commercial molecular tests that do not have an integrated extraction procedure (which can take 3 to 4 h from extraction to amplification/detection), the SAMBA maintains a competitive advantage (20) (21) (22) (23) . However, other commercial tests designed for point-of-care use have much shorter turnaround times (from 20 min to just over 1 hour) than the SAMBA (33, 34, 40) . This disadvantage could be addressed by reducing the detection and amplification times, which are currently longer than required for the expected test sensitivity, with the objective to reduce the turnaround time to approximately 1.5 h. The SAMBA has a capacity to process four samples in one test run. This throughput makes the SAMBA particularly suitable in the near-patient settings, such as in physicians' clinics, where the sample number is small and a sophisticated testing procedure is not permitted. Although the SAMBA showed good sensitivity for influenza virus typing, the samples would still need to be referred to a centralized laboratory for subtype identification in the case of epidemiological monitoring.",

These viruses were cultured in the allantoic cavities of embryonated hen eggs, quantified by plaque assay, heat inactivated (56\u00b0C for 90 min), and diluted in virus transport medium (VTM; manufactured at PHE) to which 10 6 /ml Hep2 cells were added to simulate a clinical sample. A/California/7/2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09], A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008, as well as other cultured viruses (used in determining analytical reactivities) from The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) were received in a freeze-dried format and reconstituted in 250 l of H 2 O followed by heat inactivation and quantification with the in-house qRT-PCR system using in vitro transcript as the standard (details are described below). Inactivated cultures were diluted in pooled negative swab samples in Copan universal transport medium (UTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy) to the desirable concentration (the number of copies/test [in 250 l of sample]) before RNA extraction. A panel of 10 respiratory viruses was purchased from Qnostics (Glasgow, United Kingdom). Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2 ATCC 15597-B1 was acquired from ATCC and propagated and titrated according to the supplier's instructions.",
