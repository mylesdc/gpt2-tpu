The present study examined patterns and predictors for EOL care intensity among elderly patients with CKD. Methods: We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database. A total of 65,124 CKD patients aged \u2265 60 years, who died in hospitals or shortly after discharge between 2002 and 2012 were analyzed. The primary outcomes were inpatient expenses and use of surgical interventions in the last 30 days of life. Utilization of intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and dialysis was also examined in a sub-sample of 2072 patients with detailed prescription data. Multivariate log-linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess patient-, physician-, and facility-specific predictors and the potential impact of a 2009 payment policy to reimburse hospice care for non-cancer patients. Results: During the last 30 days of life, average inpatients costs for elderly CKD patients were approximately US$10,260, with 40.9% receiving surgical interventions, 40.2% experiencing ICU admission, 45.3% undergoing mechanical ventilation, 14.7% receiving resuscitation and 42.0% receiving dialysis. Significant variability was observed in the inpatient costs and use of intensive services. Costs were lower among individuals with the following characteristics: advanced age; high income; high Charlson Comorbidity Index scores; treatment by older physicians, nephrologists, and family medicine physicians; and treatment at local hospitals. Similar findings were obtained for the use of surgical interventions and other intensive services. A declining trend was detected in the costs of EOL care, use of surgical interventions and resuscitation between 2009 and 2012, which is consistent with the impact of a 2009 NHI payment policy to reimburse non-cancer hospice care. Conclusions: Overall EOL costs and rates of intensive service use among older patients with CKD were high, with significant variability across various patient and provider characteristics. Several opportunities exist for providers and policy makers to reduce costs and enhance the value of EOL care for this population.",

Several policy interventions have also been suggested, including the recently proposed regulations by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reimburse physicians for holding advance care planning discussions with patients [2] . In Taiwan, the government launched a pilot program in 2011 and amended its Statute of Palliative Care in 2014 to promote hospice and palliative care [3] . However, the current practice of EOL care for these patients, including most of the well-intentioned programs and initiatives to improve quality or reduce costs, is not evidence-based [4] .",

To date, most of our understanding of the determinants of EOL care intensity has largely ensued from cancer care. Relevant investigations specific to other diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), are relatively much fewer [13] [14] [15] . Meanwhile, an improvement in EOL care for patients with CKD is particularly needed [16, 17] because of not only the surging prevalence and incidence of CKD and endstage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide [18, 19] , but also the remarkable rise in inpatient care for patients with ESRD during their final months [20] . Several studies have reported that patients with CKD experience substantial disease burdens at the end of life [21, 22] , and that their needs and preferences are not integrated with their care [23] . The intensity of EOL care for patients with ESRD could be higher than that observed for patients with cancer, heart failure, or dementia [24, 25] .",

The identified decedents represented CKD patients who passed away in hospitals or shortly after discharge. The latter is because of the cultural image of \"dying at home\" in Taiwan, which results in a common practice to discharge dying patients so they can return home to die [35] .

The inpatient expenditure summary files provided data for each admission, including the principal and secondary diagnoses, length of stay, total charge, and the expenditure breakdown according to categories, such as surgical, examination, drug expenses, and etc. To explore the detailed inpatient services provided, we also accessed a second data source, containing the complete inpatient prescriptions and orders of 1,000,000 randomly sampled individuals (out of the approximately 25,700,000 beneficiaries in the 2005 registry) [38] .

We used nominal expenditures in New Taiwan Dollars ($NT) because the reimbursement of services in Taiwan is based on a fee schedule that is not updated for inflation. Measures of specific health services in the literature of EOL care intensity typically fall into one of the following three categories: hospitalization [e.g., acute care and intensive care unit (ICU) use], lifesustaining interventions (e.g., resuscitation and dialysis), and potentially life-prolonging treatments (e.g., surgery and chemotherapy) [13] . Therefore, we assessed the aggressiveness of EOL care through binary variables, which indicated whether in the last month of life, patients were admitted to the ICU; received mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, or dialysis treatments (for decedents between 2005 and 2012, secondary cohort); or underwent any surgical interventions (for decedents between 2002 and 2012, primary cohort).",

During the last 30 days of life, 23.9% of decedents received inpatient care from nephrologists, with an additional 12.9% receiving care from surgeons, 4.1% from family medicine physicians, and the remaining patients from physicians of other specialties. Regional hospitals accounted for the largest share (43.5%) of EOL inpatient care, followed by medical centers (33.6%); the majority of inpatient care took place in private hospitals (66.5%). Across regions, Taipei had the largest number of the CKD decedents (28.8%), whereas the eastern region had the fewest (3.6%). During the study period, the annual number of CKD decedents peaked at 7164 during 2003, when Taiwan experienced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that may have caused adverse health outcomes [41] .

The average 30day EOL inpatient expense was approximately US$10,260 (NT$332,422, at US$1 = NT$32.4) and varied from US$8000 (NT$260,000) to US$12,300 (NT$400,000). Expenses were relatively higher for patients aged 60-70 years, females with lower insurable earnings, and those with ESRD; in addition, expenses incurred at medical centers and public hospitals were also higher. Moreover, apparent temporal variations were observed. All the aforementioned differences were statistically significant ( Table 2 ). The variation in the average probabilities of receiving surgical interventions across sub-populations was generally similar to that of the EOL inpatient expenses, except that the difference in the probabilities of surgical interventions by insurable monthly earnings group was not statistically significant.",

In comparison, in the US Medicare population, 18% of the beneficiaries underwent surgical procedures [42] , and 24% and 9% of patients with cancer were admitted to ICUs and received life-sustaining treatment [including intubation, feeding tube placement, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)], respectively, during the last month of their life [43] . Moreover, studies in other countries on patients with cancer have revealed consistently lower EOL surgical rates [44, 45] and utilization of ICU, mechanical ventilation, and resuscitation [33, [46] [47] [48] than those observed in our study population. In Taiwan, patents with cancer also had lower EOL care intensity: 11% with ICU admission, 29% with mechanical ventilation and 11% with CPR [35] . Consequently, in Taiwan, compared with the average spending of > US$10,000 for patients with CKD during their final month, the corresponding costs were approximately US$1800 for lung cancer [49] and US$2000-US$2300 for patients with liver cancer [50] . Our findings are consistent with those of an earlier US study reporting that ESRD patients received a higher intensity of EOL care than did patients with cancer [24] , even though the rates of intensive procedures observed in US ESRD populations were still lower than the estimates reported here in Taiwan [24, 31, 51] .",

Although recent studies in the US have indicated that hospice programs under Medicare are cost-saving [54, 55] and that geographical access to hospice care has greatly improved in the past decade [56] , no signs of a decrease in the intensity and cost of EOL care were observed on a systematic scale [57, 58] . In our analysis, we also noted an overall trend of a 4% annual increase in costs. Nevertheless, with the 2009 NHI policy to reimburse providers for non-cancer hospice care, we detected a significant declining trend in costs and surgical rates between 2009 and 2012. For instance, for an average ESRD decedent in a medical center, inpatient expenses between 2009 and 2012 fell by 14%, and the probability of surgical interventions in 2012 was also lower than that in 2009 (48% and 53%, respectively; Fig. 1 ). The odds of receiving resucitation also showed a significant decline after 2009, despite the limited sample size used for the sub-sample analyses. In our sample, inpatient hospice care was not used until 2009, when it began to increase at a low rate to reach approximately 4% in 2012 (Appendix 2). Therefore, the impact of the policy might be due to not only the increased use of hospice care but also the increased awareness and change in practices of the providers. Because of the lack of a control group, we cannot claim definitive causality of the policy impact; however, all the consistent evidence suggests that payment intervention is likely to be an essential tool to promote desired changes in EOL care. Future studies to confirm this finding are warranted.",

Regarding general medical services, individuals of lower SES are typically treated similarly [64] [65] [66] or less intensively [67, 68] ; however, we determined that they were likely to receive a higher intensity of EOL care. An earlier study on Taiwanese cancer decedents also reported that lower income was associated with more aggressive treatments [69] .

For instance, our findings of higher EOL costs of care and odds of any surgical procedures at medical centers and regional hospitals are in agreement with the literature that facilities with higher bed capacities are often associated with higher EOL care intensities [6, 11, 12, 15, 70] . In addition, the effects of physician characteristics identified in this study also implied that education and training can potentially help in reducing costs and intensity of EOL care, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies examining internal medicine residency training and intensity of practice during EOL care [71] . First, elderly CKD decedents attended by older physicians had lower costs and odds of receiving surgical interventions or ICU admission during the last month of their life. Through training programs for younger professionals, an opportunity exists to encourage the practice of lower intensity care for EOL. Second, the intensity of care is strongly associated with the physician specialty and is particularly low in family medicine physicians. This provides the evidence supporting the inclusion of palliative care in medical training to lower EOL care costs.",

            "text": "Our findings should be generalized with caution, particularly considering the observational nature of the data. The association identified between various predictors and costs of EOL care could be influenced by other unobserved factors, especially when claims did not contain information on patient preferences. Meanwhile, our results among patients with CKD were consistent with those of prior studies, most of which investigated cancer care, providing some assurance of the validity. In addition, a constraint of our data is the inability to specify the primary reasons why the patients were admitted. However, by limiting our sample to the elderly, we tried to minimize influences from patient heterogeneity on remaining life expectancy. Third, given the data limitation, we were not able to distinguish patients with different CKD stages, except for those with ESRD. However, many patients with CKD are diagnosed at late stages (CKD 4 and 5) because of the asymptomatic nature of CKD [72] and systemic barriers to optimal care for latestage CKD [73] . The heterogeneity in healthcare services across different CKD stages may be less obvious, and CCI scores may correlate better with healthcare needs than with CKD stage alone [74] . Although the variation and nature of EOL care intensity across different CKD stages warrants future studies, CKD stage should have very limited effects on biasing the estimates of other determinants assessed in this study. Finally, our examination of the utilization of ICU, mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and dialysis was constrained by the limited sample size of the subsample. Although the coefficients across different models were consistent, many of them did not meet our threshold of statistical significance.",

            "text": "EOL care intensity is an important and challenging issue, both in terms of the quality of care and cost containment. Our study of EOL care among elderly patients with CKD in Taiwan who died in hospitals or shortly after discharge demonstrated a high overall intensity, with significant variation in the manner of treatment during the last 30 days of life. The costs and odds of receiving intensive services were driven by a combination of physician characteristics, facility factors, and payment policies, as much as they were shaped by individual patient characteristics. These findings, together with the identified socioeconomic disparities, suggest that several opportunities exist to reduce EOL care costs, such as through payment intervention and education, to create responsive health systems that provide a high value of care to this vulnerable population.
