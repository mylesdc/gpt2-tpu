            "text": "Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and environment. Therefore, outbreak forecasting requires an integrative approach to modeling. While specific components of outbreaks are predictable, it remains unclear whether fundamental limits to outbreak prediction exist. Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.",

            "text": "\"I f we don't have a vaccine-yes, we are all going to get it 1 .\" This dire assessment by a Canadian nurse in 2003 reflected the global public health community's worst fears about the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 2,3 . These fears-for perhaps the first time in history-were partially derived from mathematical and computational models, which were developed in near real-time during the outbreak to forecast transmission risk 3, 4 . However, the predictions for SARS failed to match the data 3, 5 . Over the subsequent 15 years, the scientific community developed a rich understanding for how social contact networks, variation in health-care infrastructure, the spatial distribution of prior immunity, etc., drive complex patterns of disease transmission [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , and demonstrated that data-driven, dynamic, and or agentbased models can produce actionable forecasts [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Additionally, studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks-e.g., the expected number of cases, pace, and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability, etc.-is feasible 3, 13, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Despite these advances, an ongoing debate continues in the scientific community about both the need and our capacity to forecast outbreaks 25, 26 .",

Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time-series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction 36 , and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series.

However, instead of being based on the probability of observing a system in a particular state, it utilizes the frequency of discrete motifs, i.e symbols, associated with the growth, decay, and stasis of a time series. For example, in a binary time series the permutation entropy in two dimensions would count the frequency of the set of possible ordered pairs, {[01], [10] }, and the Shannon entropy, or uniformity, of this distribution is the permutation entropy. In higher dimensions, one can define an alphabet of symbols over all factorial combinations of orderings in a given dimension, e.g., {[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0] , [1, 0, 2] , etc.}, over which the permutation entropy will be defined. A time series that visits all the possible symbols with equal frequency will have maximal entropy and minimal predictability, and a time series that only samples a few of the possible symbols will instead have lower entropy and hence be more predictable.",

To control for differences in dimension and for the effect of timeseries length on the entropy estimation, we normalize the entropy by log(d!), ensure that each window is greater in length than d!, and confirm that the estimate of H p has stabilized (specifically that the marginal change in H p as data are added is <1%). To facilitate interpretation, we present results from continuous intervals by fixing \u03c4 = 1.

For comparison, we calculate the same moving-window estimate of the permutation entropy for the time series of measles cases in Texas prior to the introduction of the first vaccine. The critical observation is that the moving-window entropy for the measles time series fluctuates between values comparable with that of pure random noise and, at times, values closer to the more predictable periodic signal, which suggests alternating intervals with different dynamical regimes and, thus, predictability. The magnitude of the entropy fluctuations for measles in Texas is statistically significant by permutation test, p < 0.001, as compared with simulated fluctuations obtained by building an estimated multinomial distribution over the symbols and repeatedly calculating the expected Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence from simulations.",

The confidence intervals in Fig. 2 show that there can be large variation in predictability across outbreaks of the same disease, providing a first indication of the presence of a changing underlying model structures and or dynamics on the scale of months. We obtained similar results, e.g., decreasing predictability with time-series length, clustering of diseases, and the emergence of barriers to forecasting, using a weighted version of the permutation entropy, which reduces the dependence of the standard unweighted permutation entropy on rare, large fluctuations and by considering estimates of the permutation entropy where the time delay, \u03c4, is allowed to vary 32, 40 (see Supplementary Figure 4 ).

After re-normalizing time for each disease by its corresponding R 0 (the average number of secondary infections a pathogen will generate during an outbreak epidemic when the entire population is susceptible, very large, and is seeded with a single infectious individual)-we used the mean of all reported values found in a literature review (see Supplementary Table 1 )we find that the best-fit mixed-effect slope on a log scale is 1 and that the residual effect is well predicted by the times series' embedding dimension d (see Supplementary Figures 2 and 3) . Moreover, because the embedding dimension d of a time series is the length of the basic blocks used in the calculation of the permutation entropy, it encodes the fundamental temporal unit of predictability in the form of an entropy production rate, thus implying that predictability decreases with time-series data at a disease-specific rate determined to first order by R 0 , which is further modulated by d. The result that predictability depends on temporal scale also suggests that the permutation entropy could be an approach for justifying the utility of different data sets, i.e. one could determine the optimal granularity of data by selecting the dimension that maximized predictability. Table 1) against the log of the permutation entropy Drivers of disease time-series predictability. One might assume that this phenomenon, i.e. decreasing predictability with increasing time-series length, could be driven purely by random walks on the symbolic alphabet used in the permutation entropy estimation. However, n-dimensional Markov chain models built from the timeseries embeddings (n = d the time-series embedding dimension) consistently produced stable and smaller predictability values in comparison with those obtained from data, corroborating that the predictability behavior we observe does not stem from random fluctuations but is an actual fundamental feature of spreading processes (see Supplementary Figure 6 and Methods for details on the Markov chain simulations). This observation that Markov chain models of the same embedding order do not reproduce the observed predictability indicates that either the model structure is changing in time and/or the system has a very long memory, which is consistent with our current understanding of the entanglement between mobility and disease 3, 42 . That the best-fit n-dimensional Markov chain models over-predict the amount of entropy in real systems, also supports our earlier results that predictable structure does exist across most long outbreak time series.",

We consistently observe that predictability decreases after vaccination, again with significance determined by permutation test (Fig. 4a) . We also find that the symbol frequency distribution changes significantly after vaccination, as measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence, across all states in the United States (Fig. 4b) . Critically, because-as stated earlier-permutation entropy is not affected by changes in magnitude, the difference in entropy cannot simply be accounted for by a reduction in cases. Instead, it means that the temporal pattern of cases changes after vaccination.

In this model we can control the epidemic threshold and the number of secondary contacts by changing the activity and the number of contacted nodes per activation. We simulated two scenarios, one in which the number of contacted nodes per activation is fixed (regular SAD) and one in which we allow fluctuations in contact number (irregular SAD), which generates fluctuations in the number of secondary infections. For both models, we investigated the predictability from below to above the epidemic or critical transmissibility threshold (set to 1 here). From the resulting epidemic curves, we calculated the permutation entropy. Figure 5a shows that we find the same pattern of decreasing predictability observed in real data with longer time series. Figure 5b shows the predictability obtained for the two scenarios below and above the transition: we see that that the strongest difference is present below the transition, where the lack of peculiar structure (the regular contact pattern) induces lower predictabilities than for heterogeneous contact distributions.

However, across that same body work, researchers typically find that predictions improve when they are trained on longer time series, even for chaotic systems 41 . Indeed, even for permutation entropy, an active area of research is how spurious aspects of time series can lead to spuriously increasing predictability with increasing time-series lengths 37 . Our data-driven results suggest that for infectious diseases the opposite is true, more time-series data might often lead to lower predictability. Then, by integrating our biological understanding of each pathogen and simulated outbreaks, we found that changing dynamics, e.g., empirical changes in vaccination coverage and simulated shifts in the number of secondary infections as a disease moves through a heterogeneous social network, can cause the prediction error to increase with increasing data, which is related to earlier findings on the role of airline travel networks and disease forecasting 36 . What this implies is that different models generate data at different time points and suggests that the optimal coarse-graining of complex systems might change with scale and or time 53 . The potential for scale-dependent models of infectious disease transmission is supported by a recent analysis of US citylevel data on influenza outbreaks that found consistent, mechanistic differences in outbreak dynamics based on city size 54 .",

Our results demonstrate that outbreaks should be predictable. However, as outbreaks spread-and spatiotemporally separated waves become entangled with the substrate, human mobility, behavioral changes, pathogen evolution, etc.-the system is driven through a space of diverse model structures, driving down predictability despite increasing time-series lengths. Taken together, our results agree with observations that accurate long-range forecasts for complex adaptive systems, e.g., contagions beyond a single outbreak, may be impossible to achieve due to the emergence of entropy barriers. However, they also support the utility and accuracy of dynamical modeling approaches for infectious disease forecasting, especially those that leverage myriad data streams and are iteratively calibrated as outbreaks evolves. Lastly, our results also suggest that cross-validation over long infectious disease time series cannot guarantee that the correct model for any individual window of time will be favored, which would imply a no free lunch theorem 57 for infectious disease model selection, and perhaps for sociobiological systems more generally. When considering the uniform (reg., blue) and heterogeneous (irr., brown) scenarios separately, we find that the largest difference in predictability is found below the corresponding epidemic transition consistent with the idea that noisy, sputtering infection trees are harder to predict than the epidemic waves above the transition. The solid line represents the median, boxes enclose the 25th to 75th percentiles of the distributions, and whiskers cover the entire distribution.

We utilize \u03c4 = 1 and the embedding dimension d i previously selected during the permutation entropy computation as described by Brandmeier 38 . For a time series with embedding dimension d, there is a maximum number of d! states, corresponding to the possible permutations of length d. Using the permutations as states, we then count the number of transitions n ij in the real time series between each pair of symbols (i,j) and use it to build a Markov chain with transition probabilities between states given by p ij \u00bc n ij P j n ij . In order to obtain a synthetic symbolic series, we repeatedly start from a randomly selected node and use the Markov Chain described above to produce symbolic series with the same number of symbols as the corresponding real time series. For each iteration, we calculate the associated symbolic entropy. In Supplementary Figure 6 , we compare the synthetic entropies versus the permutation entropy of the original time series and show that the former are systematically higher than the real ones, implying that there is additional structure in the outbreak time series that is not captured simply by the probabilistic transition structure.",

The permutation entropy in windows of size 52 weeks across three time series of equal length: (1) dark red: Gaussian-white-noise (\u03bc = 0, \u03c3 = 1); (2) gray: measles cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from the state of Texas between 1927 and 1965 (gray dashed line, lower panel) as digitized from MMWR reports by Project Tycho 60 ; and (3) blue: a sine wave with Gaussian noise (\u03bc = 0, \u03c3 = 0.01). The fluctuations in the permutation entropy calculated from the measles time series (gray dashed line) are larger than would be predicted by chance and result in periods of time where model-based forecasts should be accurate (in the range of a noisy sine wave, blue shaded region) and periods of time (in the range of the white noise, red shaded region) when statistical forecasts based solely on the time-series data should outperform model-Single outbreaks are often predictable. a The average predictability (1 \u2212 H p ) for weekly, state-level data from nine diseases is plotted as a function of time-series length in weeks. For each disease, we selected 1000 random starting locations in each time series and calculated the permutation entropy in rolling windows in lengths ranging from 2 to 104 weeks. The solid lines indicate the mean value and the shaded region marks the interquartile range across all states and starting locations in the time series. Although the slopes are different for each disease, in all cases, longer time series result in lower predictability. However, most diseases are predictable across single outbreaks and disease time series cluster together, i.e. there are diseasespecific slopes on the relationship between predictability and time-series length. To aid in interpretation, the black dashed line plots the median permutation entropy across 20,000 stochastic simulations of a Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, as described in the Supplement. This SIR model would be considered predictable, thus values above the black line might be thought of as in-the-range where model-based forecasts are expected to outperform forecasts based solely on statistical properties of the time-series data. The dark brown, dashed vertical line indicates the time period selected for b.In b, the predictability is shown after 4 months, i.e. 16 weeks, of data for each pathogen. The same procedure was used to generate the permutation entropy as in a. The mean predictability differed both by disease and by geographic location, i.e state (analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey honest significant differences test and correction for multiple comparison, sum of squares (SS) disease = 98.22, degrees of freedom (DF) disease = 8, p-value disease < 0.001; SS location = 94.7, DF location = 53, p-value location < 0.001). The solid line represents the median, boxes enclose the 25th to 75th percentiles of the distributions, and whiskers cover the entire distribution Permutation entropy and time-series length show regularity by disease. a The predictability (1 \u2212 H p ) for chlamydia, dengue, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping cough is plotted as a function of time-series length in weeks. Although the slopes are different for each disease, in all cases, longer time series, i.e. more data, result in lower predictability. However, we again find that single outbreaks should be predictable and that diseases show a remarkable degree of clustering based on the slope of entropy gain. In this analysis, each dot represents the predictability for an entire state-level time series for a disease, i.e. the window size is the entire time series. b Rescaled time-series length based on the mean published basic reproductive number. Here we plot the log of time normalized by the basic reproductive number, i.e. R 0 , from the literature (see Supplementary",

A rolling window estimate of the permutation entropy for weekly measles cases reported to the CDC from the state of Texas between 1927 and 1983 (red dashed line). The vertical blue line indicates when the first measles vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Shortly after the vaccine was introduced the permutation entropy increased significantly, which is expected after a system experiences a change to its model structure, in this case vaccination. b Permutation entropy detects changing model structure across all states in the United States. The box-plots aggregate the Jensen-Shannon divergences between pairs of windows that are both in the pre-vaccine era (light brown), have one window in the pre-and one in the post-vaccine era (red) and both in the post-vaccine era (dark drown). The Jensen-Shannon divergence of the symbol frequency distribution was calculated between all pairs of rolling 1-year (52 week) windows for measles time series across the United States. The average divergence between symbol distributions was higher between windows in the pre-and post-vaccine era, as compared to windows that were either both in the pre-or both in the postvaccine era (determined by permutation test and by an analysis of variance that also included state-level differences in the Jensen-Shannon divergence and a Tukey honest significant differences post hoc test, which contained a correction for multiple comparisons).
