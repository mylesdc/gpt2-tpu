            "text": "Background: In viral disease, infection is controlled at the cellular level by type I interferon (IFN-I), but dengue virus (DENV) has the ability to inhibit this response. Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-\u03bb), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN-\u03bb (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. Methods: Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN-\u03bb levels by ELISA. To study the IFN-\u03bb response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN-\u03bb on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. Results: We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN-\u03bb in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN-\u03bb inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISG's peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-\u03bb1 expression. Conclusions: Evidence described here suggests that IFN-\u03bb is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN-\u03bb need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease. Furthermore, we report a novel epithelial model to study dengue infection in vitro.",

For this analysis, we selected the OAS1 and MX1 genes as indicative of interferon pathway functionality for the antiviral response, the IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03b2 genes, and two negative regulatory genes, SOCS1 and SOCS3. Figure 8a shows that stimulation of C33-A cells with IFN-\u03bb1 slightly increases the transcription of OAS1 to similar levels between 6 and 48 h post-treatment (pt). DENV-2 infection significantly increases OAS1 mRNA but at earlier times, peaking at 6 h post-infection. However, the most striking effect was present with IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment followed by DENV-2 infection, that showed a pronounced increase in OAS1 expression from 6 to 18 h post-infection, at which time it peaked and then underwent a slow steady decrease, remaining b Extracts of total protein from each condition were used for Western blotting to determine the presence of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2 proteins. Actin was the loading control. A semi quantitative analysis of detected bands normalized to actin was performed using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) high at 24 and 48 h. This result suggests that IFN-\u03bb1 decreases DENV-2 replication in part by viral mRNA degradation via RNase L. Moreover, stimulation of cells with IFN-\u03bb1 dramatically increases MX1 gene transcription, suggesting that the efficient activation of IFN-III signal transduction is useful in controlling DENV-2 infection. IFN-\u03bb1 treatment induced a bimodal MX1 increase with a first peak at 6 h post-infection and a second peak nearly 100-fold higher than basal at 24 h (Fig. 8b) . Bimodality probably is due as a result of a first wave of activation by IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 and subsequently, the increase at 24 h could be by IFN-\u03bb2, which has demonstrated late induction, as well as by the late wave of endogenous interferons [22] . MX1 mRNA was detected at similar levels in infected and non-infected cells at all the studied times, suggesting that DENV induces an impairment in IFN signal transduction; however, this experiment cannot discriminate between IFN-I or IFN-III specific pathways. In cells pre-treated with IFN-\u03bb1 and then infected, MX1 mRNA increased between 18 and 48 h post-infection, although not as much as OAS1.",

Figure 8c shows that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA is not increased at all in cells infected with DENV-2 at any of the studied times. IFN-\u03bb1 stimulation increased IFN-\u03b2 mRNA~20-30 times between 6 and 24 h post-treatment. In contrast, IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment followed by DENV-2 infection showed a <10-fold increase in IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, remaining much lower than with IFN-\u03bb1 stimulation alone. Therefore, it is believe that DENV-2 could affect the transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 gene, probably by affecting IRFs.",

In the present study we found that the C33-A cervical, epithelial cell line is permissive to DENV-2 infection and that this cell line both produces and responds to IFN-\u03bb. IL28R1, which is essential to support the antiviral action of IFN-\u03bb, is expressed in C33-A cells.

These data suggest that dengue virus and the IFN-\u03bb treatment can active ISGs without type I IFNs. However, pre-treatment with IFN-\u03bb1 before dengue infection was not able to inhibit viral replication to the same degree in Vero as in C33-A cells, which shows that dengue virus can block activated signalling pathways that induce both type I and III interferons. Since viral titers did not decrease markedly with the highest IFN-\u03bb1 doses used, the data suggest that viral replication can be inhibited, albeit weakly, by endogenous and exogenous IFN-\u03bb1 in complete absence of IFN-I. Furthermore, the reduction in viral progeny observed with IFN-\u03bb1+ IFN-\u03b1, suggests that both interferons work synergistically. Importantly, the MX1 gene can be induced in Vero cells stimulated with recombinant type I interferon, thus demonstrating that although these cells don't produce IFN-I they respond to it [21, 31, 32] .",

Cells were permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton-X100 for 2 min in order to detect the viral pr-M protein inside infected cells and incubated in blocking solution (PBS with 10 % FBS and 0.2 % Tween 20). Cells were labelled with anti-dengue virus pr-M antibody (Abcam, ab41473) or anti-IL28R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-66541), washed and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG-Texas red (Abcam, ab6726) or bovine anti-goat IgG-CFL-647 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-362284) for 1 h at room temperature. SYBR-14 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used to stain the nuclei. The stained cells were visualized by laser confocal microscopy system E600-C1 using the image analysis software EZ-C1 (Nikon).",

Reverse transcription was performed using RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase kit (Thermo Scientific) and random hexamers. The reaction program was 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min and 70\u00b0C for 10 min. The obtained cDNA was used to amplify the IFN-\u03b2, OAS1 and MX1 genes using the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix, no AmpErase UNG kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). IFN-\u03bb1, SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes were amplified using Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific). The reaction mixture contained 5 \u03bcl 2X Master Mix, 200 nM of each sense and antisense primer, 200 nM of Taqman probe and 35-50 ng RNA in a final volume of 10 \u03bcl. Forty PCR cycles were performed at . In all cases, HPRT1 (Hypoxanthine Guanine Phosphoribosyl Transferase) gene was used as an internal control to determine the relative expression of each gene. All primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). Obtained Ct values were analyzed by the 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394Ct method, and the expression levels were reported as proportions with respect to controls. Sequences of primers and probes are shown in Table 1 .",
