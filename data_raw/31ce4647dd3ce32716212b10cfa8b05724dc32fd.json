            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death, particularly in neonatal piglets. The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of PEDV presents strong immunogenicity and contributes to the cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. However, the characterization of epitopes on the PEDV N protein remains largely unknown. Here, two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to the N protein of a PEDV strain, FJzz1/2011, were generated and screened against a partially overlapping library of 24 GST-fusion N protein-truncated constructs. We confirmed that residues 18-133 (designated NEP-D4) and residues 252-262 (designated NEP-D6) were the epitopes targeted by MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that these two epitopes were highly conserved among PEDV strains but were significantly different from other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily. Western blot analysis showed that they could be specifically recognized by PEDV antisera but could not be recognized by TGEV hyperimmune antisera. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) assays confirmed no cross-reaction between these two MAbs and TGEV. In addition, the freeze-thaw cycle and protease treatment results indicated that NEP-D4 was intrinsically disordered. All these results suggest that these two novel epitopes and their cognate MAbs could serve as the basis for the development of precise diagnostic assays for PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. The genome of this single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus encodes, from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 , the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, spike (S) protein, ORF3 accessory protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein 1-3 . The typical clinical signs of PEDV infection include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first reported in England in 1971 and then in many other European and Asian countries in the following 30 years. With the advent of live attenuated vaccines, acute outbreaks became rare in both Europe and Asia during 2000-2006 4-8 . Since 2007, however, PEDV has re-emerged and spread across the globe, reaching Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and China), Europe (Germany, Spain, Belgium, France, and Portugal), North America (US, Mexico, and Canada), and Australia. These outbreaks were characterized by high morbidity (80-100%) and mortality (50-90%) among suckling piglets 9-23 , causing substantial financial losses to the domestic swine industry. The severity of these epidemics emphasizes the importance of establishing effective disease control and prevention systems worldwide 24 , which will largely depend on well-validated diagnostics tests and vaccinations for PEDV.",

Previous studies have shown that PEDV N protein is responsible for viral nucleolar localization, host cycle ER stress, S-phase prolongation, up-regulation of interleukin-8 expression and inhibition of interferon-\u03b2 production 27-29 . In addition, PEDV N protein is highly conserved. Large amounts of PEDV N protein can be detected in virus-infected cells, and abundant antibodies against N protein could be induced at the early stage of PEDV infection 30, 31 . Such features of the N protein make it an ideal target antigen for PEDV diagnosis 32 , emphasizing the importance of characterizing the epitopes of PEDV N protein and their related MAbs. Previous research on this issue has been scarce. To our knowledge, only one MAb specific to PEDV N protein has been reported so far, with little information regarding its corresponding epitope and whether it could cross-react with TGEV N protein 33 . More detailed research aimed at characterizing PEDV N protein epitopes is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Acute diarrhea caused by PEDV is clinically difficult to distinguish from disease caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Therefore, PEDV infection cannot be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings alone, and laboratory tests are necessary for an etiological diagnosis 34 . Presently, the most commonly used diagnostic methods are reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, both of which have a high efficiency and reliability in detecting viral genetic materials in fecal and intestinal samples. In addition, immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunochromatography assays and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIAs) have been widely used to diagnose PEDV infection [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Among these methods, ELISA has the greatest potential for clinical diagnosis on a large scale and the greatest significance for the effective detection and control of PEDV, especially in developing countries, where few pig farms are equipped with qualified laboratories for complicated molecular diagnoses. However, the previously established method of indirect ELISA used either the viral proteins extracted from PEDV-infected Vero cells or recombinant N protein generated in Escherichia coli as coating antigens; in some documented DAS-ELISA methods, the specificity of the capture and detection antibodies was unclear 40, 41, 46 . Furthermore, in a recent study, researchers observed the cross-reactivity between PEDV and pig TGEV antisera. They also inferred that one or more epitopes on the N protein could be the contributing factors 47 . These findings called into question the accuracy of current ELISA methods. To establish more reliable serodiagnostic methods for PEDV, it is important to generate MAbs that bind only to PEDV N protein and to map which of their corresponding epitopes that can be recognized by PEDV pig antisera alone.",

            "text": "Most proteins carry out biological functions based on their unique and stable three-dimensional structures. However, studies in recent decades have reported an increasing number of proteins that are fully (intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs) or partially (intrinsically disordered regions, IDRs) unfolded or disordered under normal physiological conditions yet remain active and functional [48] [49] [50] [51] . Moreover, the essential roles of IDPs/IDRs in the protein interaction network, including cell signaling, transcription, translation, and the cell cycle, have been confirmed 50,52-54 . In particular, disorder abundance can be predicted and observed in viral proteins 55,56 . The unstable structures of IDPs/IDRs make it difficult for the immune system to recognize the viral epitopes, eliciting a poor immune response from the host. Partially or wholly unfolded viral proteins can also quickly adapt to and survive in the host environment due to the very high mutation rates of viral genomes 57,58 . Moreover, IDPs, as important components of antigens, are abundant in several pathogenic organisms 59,60 . Disordered epitopes are distinct and specific, and they efficiently interact with their cognate antibodies 60,61 . Studies have demonstrated that the molecular mechanism by which IDPs function is closely associated with the transition from the disordered to the folded state upon binding with their partners, which could be proteins, DNA, RNA or membranes 51,62,63 . However, a similar phenomenon in terms of the recognition of disordered epitopes by antibodies has not yet been reported. Studies on SARS have demonstrated that IDRs comprise the flexible linker between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in N protein and have RNA-binding abilities 64 . However, little attention has been paid to characterizing other intrinsically disordered epitopes of Coronaviruses.",

Further analysis based on sequence alignment, IFA and Western blotting showed the conservation, specificity and immunogenicity of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6. We also demonstrated that both NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 failed to result in cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. Thus, these two MAbs (PN-D4 and PN-D6) and their corresponding epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) could be theoretically applied to clinically accessible diagnostic assays for PEDV. In addition, GeneSilico metadisorder and Phyre2 3D structure prediction, freeze-thaw cycle analysis, and treatment with trypsin and DTT all indicated that NEP-D4 is probably an intrinsically disordered protein. Based on these findings, we speculated that the folding following the binding effect might be the factor behind the recognition of NEP-D4 by PN-D4. This finding has not been previously reported but might warrant further investigation aimed at better understanding the mechanism by which a disordered epitope combines with its cognate antibody.",

To better understand the effect of NEP-D4 in combination with PN-D4, we used multiple online tools to compute the physical and chemical parameters of NEP-D4. One of these tools, the GeneSilico MetaDisorder server, was used to predict the intrinsic disorder. Three regions presented with the highest propensity for intrinsic disorder, which we designated as PIDR [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , PIDR 107-116 and PIDR 127-133 (Fig. 5a) . The prediction suggested that there might be some intrinsically disordered regions on NEP-D4. To verify this prediction, purified GST-tagged NEP-D4 was treated with trypsin and used for detection against PN-D4 or anti-GST antibody by Western blotting. We observed that the trypsin-treated peptide The segments that could be recognized by both PN-D4 and PN-D6 are highlighted in red; the segments that could only be recognized by PN-D4 are highlighted in blue; the segments that could only be recognized by PN-D6 are highlighted in green; and the segments in gray are those that could not be recognized by either PN-D4 or PN-D6. According to (a), the N gene was divided into mutually overlapping N1 and N2 fragments and was directionally cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector. (b) Six hours after the addition of 1 mM IPTG, the induced products of GST-N, GST-N1 and GST-N2 were processed and analyzed using SDS-PAGE (12% separating gel and 5% stacking gel). (c) Next, the GST fusion proteins GST-N, GST-N1 and GST-N2 were coated onto ELISA plates (0.5 \u03bc g/well) and were probed with MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6. After the first round of identification, N1 and N2 were further divided and expressed in two series of fusion proteins, GST-N1-1-GST-N1-11 and GST-N2-1-GST-N2-11 (d,h), which were analyzed by Western blotting and ELISA using PN-D4 (e,g), PN-D6 (i,k), and anti-GST Tag antibody (f,j), respectively. was recognized by anti-GST antibody but not by MAb PN-D4 (Fig. 5b ). In addition, we repeated the experiment with the freeze-thaw cycle-treated GST-tagged NEP-D4. The result showed that the treated peptide (up to 5 and 10 cycles) could be recognized by MAb PN-D4 but not by the anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5c ). The intrinsically disordered proteins have a high proportion of solvent-exposed residues, making them highly accessible to protease and resistant to cold treatment 65, 66 .

The amino acids of NEP-D6 were located in close proximity and were exposed on the surface of the N protein, suggesting that NEP-D6 is highly likely to be a linear epitope.

The accurate diagnosis at the early stage of infection plays a key role in PEDV prevention. The N protein of PEDV consists of 441 amino acids and represents an essential agent in the formation of the virus nucleocapsid structure. The abundant expression of N protein in PEDV-infected cells and the high conservation among different PEDV strains make it fairly suitable for use as a target for PEDV diagnosis 30, 68 . However, the epitopes on PEDV N protein have been poorly characterized. In the present study, six monoclonal antibodies were generated against PEDV from BALB/c mice immunized with the purified PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. Among these antibodies, MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 were demonstrated as N protein-specific; the remaining four MAbs are still being studied (data not shown). Combined with ELISA and Western blotting, peptide scanning was performed to identify the epitopes of MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6. We confirmed that Leu 18 and Ile 133 were the essential amino acids of the epitope NEP-D4 because the deletion of either of these amino acids stopped the recognition between NEP-D4 and PN-D4. Notably, the absorbance value also largely declined when the peptide was truncated at Leu 18 instead of Ser 17 . Therefore, Ser 17 might have a significant effect on the antigenicity of NEP-D4, although Leu 18 was the only essential amino acid at the N-terminus of this epitope. Likewise, Arg 252 and Lys 262 are crucial amino acids for the binding of epitope NEP-D6 with MAb PN-D6. The results suggested that NEP-D4 (residues 18-133) and NEP-D6 (residues 252-262) are the specific antigenic epitopes of MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively.",

Although three major mutations, Asn 123 to Lys, Arg 252 to Lys, and Ser 255 to Asn, were observed in certain strains, these substitutions do not alter the antigenicity of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 because PN-D4 and PN-D6 could precisely recognize another PEDV strain, HLJ/2011, which was isolated in our laboratory and contains all three of these mutations ( Fig. 3g and h) . In addition, we demonstrated that NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 could be recognized by PEDV pig antisera collected at 14 and 21 days after inoculation with PEDV, indicating that PEDV infection could induce specific host antibodies against NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 ( Fig. 3c and d) .

Thus, the epitopes of N protein used for PEDV diagnosis should be highly PEDV-specific and the reported immunoassays above should be seriously re-examined. We analyzed the NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 epitope sequences of PEDV and other members within the subfamily Coronavirinae, especially TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV, all of which can infect newborn piglets. We found that the amino acid sequences of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 of PEDV differed greatly from their counterparts in other coronaviruses. NEP-D4 shared less than 43.1% homology with TGEV and PRCV of Alphacoronavirus, and only 26.5% homology with PDCoV of Deltacoronavirus. The homology of NEP-D6 between PEDV and the other three viruses (TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV) remained at zero. We also used IFA to investigate whether NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 could induce cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. The results showed that neither PN-D4 nor PN-D6 recognized TGEV, and the TGEV SH/2012 hyperimmune pig antisera failed to react with NEP-D4 and NEP-D6; these results indicated that NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 were unable to cause a cross-reaction between PEDV and TGEV. Therefore, the MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 and their corresponding epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 have the potential for use in developing an immunoassay that differentiates between PEDV and TGEV.",

            "text": "The epitope NEP-D6 has 11 amino acids and can be recognized by PN-D6 using Western blotting, a method that imposes protein denaturation. This finding indicates that NEP-D6 is a linear epitope, which agreed with the result that NEP-D6 is located on the surface of the predicted 3D structure of N protein ( Fig. 6a and b) . However, the epitope NEP-D4 seems much more complicated. Western blotting suggested that NEP-D4 is a linear epitope, which contradicts the previous assumption that the full 116 aa length is too large to be a linear epitope when bound to an antibody. Again, multiple residues are buried inside N protein, and there is a significant spatial distance between the first residue (Leu 18 ) and last residue (Glu 133 ) of NEP-D4 (Fig. 6d,e and f) . The NEP-D4 portion of the 3D model is highly reliable because the residues 18-133 were constructed based on five templates (PDB IDs: c3hd4A, d2bxxa1, d2geca1, d1sska and c4ud1B) at nearly 100% confidence, as shown in Fig. 6h . Therefore, NEP-D4 is more likely to be a conformational epitope than a linear epitope. Interestingly, a denatured conformational epitope is unexpectedly recognized by its cognate antibody in Western blotting. Although it is possible that the formation of some disulfide bridges between certain residues may have contributed to this binding effect, this possibility was ruled out by the ability of PN-D4 to react with dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated NEP-D4 in a Western blotting assay (Fig. 5d) . Additionally, no disulfide bridges were predicted by the online software PredictProtein (data not shown). We also analyzed the other properties of NEP-D4. The software GeneSilico metadisorder predicted that NEP-D4 is an intrinsically disordered protein, which was further confirmed by two independent experiments: namely, trypsin-treated NEP-D4 could not react with PN-D4, and NEP-D4 underwent freeze-thaw The disorder plot for epitope EP4 was predicted by GeneSilico metadisorder. The x-axis shows the residues from 18 to 133, and the y-axis shows the disordered tendency ranging from 0 to 1. All residues with a disorder probability of more than 0.5 were considered to be disordered. The residues with plotted lines in the light blue region were predicted to be disordered; their counterparts in the bluish white area were considered ordered. (b) Four GST-NEP-D4 samples were treated with Trypsin under the same conditions, and the reactions were stopped at 0 min, 1 min, 5 min and 15 min. Next, the samples were processed and analyzed by Western Blotting using anti-GST antibody and PN-D4 as the primary antibodies. (c) Similarly, four additional GST-NEP-D4 samples were treated with freeze (\u2212 80 \u00b0C) and thaw (room temperature) cycles, which were repeated up to 0, 1, 5 and 10, times, respectively. Next, these samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the same antibodies above. (d) To rule out the interference of disulfide bridges, the reduced (1 M DTT-treated) and non-reduced (non DTT-treated) GST-NEP-D4 were analyzed by Western blotting using PN-D4. cycles (up to 5 and 10 times) that were indeed recognized by PN-D4, albeit weakly. As previous findings have shown, the solvent-exposed residues on IDPs make proteins highly susceptible to protease; moreover, IDPs have much higher cold stability than structured proteins 65, 66 . Thus, we speculated that folding occurred upon binding, which may have led to the recognition of NEP-D4 by PN-D4. Specifically, when the antibody binds to the first or last residue of the epitope NEP-D4, it may trigger the disordered domain to fold completely to form a certain conformational site, which could, in turn, be recognized by MAb PN-D4. In a previous study, different PEDV and TGEV pig antisera were used in a two-way cross-reactivity examination of different PEDV and TGEV strains, but only a one-way reactivity between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and PEDV strains was observed. The complex mechanism remains unclear 47 . However, given that the N-terminal region of the N protein is intrinsically disordered, some disordered epitopes such as NEP-D4, which may be folded under certain conditions, might be the cause of the one-cross reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. In other words, the antibodies generated from PEDF infection cannot induce the folding of the disordered epitope on TGEV, whereas the corresponding epitope on PEDV can fold upon the binding of the antibodies produced from the infection of certain TGEV strains with specific epitopes. These hypotheses merit further investigation.",

The ELISA plates were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBST (PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Thereafter, the plates were washed three times with PBST, and ascites fluids raised against PEDV were added as primary antibodies to each well at a dilution of 1:200 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed again with PBST three times, and HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (1/10,000 dilution) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) was added as a secondary antibody at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBST five times, and 3,3\u2032 ,5,5\u2032 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Amresco, Cleveland, OH, USA) was added to each well for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, 2 M H 2 SO 4 was added to the plates to stop the reaction, and the absorbance value of each well at 450 nm was read. To map the epitopes of N protein, all other GST fusion proteins (GST-N1, GST-N2, GST-N1-1-GST-N1-11, and GST-N2-1-GST-N2-11) were coated onto ELISA plates and were detected using the MAbs PN-D4 or PN-D6 as the primary antibodies using the same method above.",
