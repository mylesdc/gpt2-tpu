Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. \"Tolerogenic\" microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, \"inflammatory\" peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFN\u03b3 production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes.

This phenomenon, termed molecular mimicry, was originally described in Fujinami et al. [1] and is hypothesized to play an important role in the development of certain autoimmune diseases [2] . There has been a recent renewed interest in this concept, where similarity and cross-reactivity have been demonstrated for distant sources such as HIV, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus [3, 4] . Furthermore, we have recently shown that cross-reactivity may also occur between influenza virus and the food allergen ovalbumin with functional relevance for the prevention of food allergic Th2 immune responses [5] . A related concept where peptide similarity drives immune recognition is the conservation of peptides in one pathogen across others. For example, in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [6] certain epitopes that are highly reactive share significant similarity to nontuberculous mycobacteria, while in other cases extensive sequence similarity to several bacterial classes seems to be associated with loss of reactivity.",

Specifically, we considered eleven sets of allergen epitopes derived from food allergens, various plants, fungi, insects, mites and mammals. We further considered four different sets of epitopes associated with autoimmune diseases (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gluten-associated disease and multiple sclerosis).

The four-fold greater number of KOs in the non-allergic group than in the allergic group is reflected in a greater probability of finding matches for any given peptide due to a larger set of sequences.

Sequence similarity might influence and explain downregulation and tolerogenic immune responses versus \"inflammatory\" immune reactions to potentially cross-reactive antigens/allergens. The data presented herein provides an extension of the concept of how self/non-self cross-reactivity shapes the repertoire of an individual's reactivity. First, it provides an extension of the concept of immunological tolerance beyond the sequences encoded by the individual host genome. It is well appreciated that T cells recognizing selfsequences capable of binding self MHC are largely eliminated by central tolerance, and those that do escape the process are actually often associated with regulatory activity, leading to the concept of Tregitopes [27, 28] . Our data suggests the concept of \"self\" expands beyond the sequences encoded in the genome, to the sequences of the myriad of microorganisms that cohabitate within the living space provided in the human body. This is expected to be the result of peripheral tolerance, where T cells mounting an inflammatory immune responses against non-self antigen can be suppressed by regulatory immune mechanisms intended to limit inflammation in the absence of real danger to the host.",

Bacteria present in the microbiome secrete soluble factors and metabolites and these bioactive compounds affect the function of intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune cells, resulting in production of cytokines and related factors [29, 30] . Microbiome antigens and metabolites have been proposed to induce peripherally derived regulatory T cells.

            "text": "In addition, and in parallel to general immunomodulatory effects, we propose an analogous mechanism based on sequence similarity and molecular cross-reactivity. Indeed, microbiome antigens would be expected, like any other antigen (self or pathogen), to be processed by host APCs which will result in the generation of HLA bound peptides. Furthermore, these peptides are not expected to be presented in the thymus during early ontogeny and would therefore not be subject to central tolerance, and would thus have the potential of being recognized as nonself epitopes. Yet, under normal conditions these microbiome-derived epitopes are not associated with effector type responses, presumably because of peripheral tolerance mechanisms. We propose herein that these mechanisms controlling and regulating potential responses to HLA class II bound and microbiome-derived peptides generated by antigen processing of the microbiome microorganism must necessarily extend to highly homologous epitopes encoded in other protein sequences of pathogen, allergen or autoantigen origin. We propose that the microbiome influences the host immune reactivity both by general immunomodulatory mechanisms and antigen-specific modulation of immune responses, and that both mechanisms act in parallel and in a potentially synergistic fashion. Microbial sequence similarities in subsequent heterologous T cell responses may have profound clinical implications on several levels: (i) heterologous T cell immunity between microbes and self-antigens may extend the concept that (early life) exposure to certain microbes favors the development of clinical immunological tolerance. In addition to unspecific effects promoted by microbial compounds and metabolites [31] , here we propose an additional strategy on the level of T cell specificity. (ii) Dependent on the local cytokine milieu this level of cross-reactivity may also result in an inflammatory response. This is an unexpected finding which has also been recently described by Atarashi et al. [32] . This observation suggests that microbiome-specific T cells normally exist in the peripheral T cell repertoire, and depending on the additional milieu and context may exert an inhibitory tolerogenic effect, or on the contrary in particular conditions have an inflammatory effect. Here we have used IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 as surrogates for tolerogenic and inflammatory types of immune responses. Whether the inflammatory type is solely dependent on IFN\u03b3 remains to be investigated.",

The above-mentioned study in the context of antibiotic treatment in tuberculosis illustrates an example of how microbiome homology can alter the pattern of immune responses. The data presented in this study related to microbiome homology and cockroach allergen T cell epitope repertoire in allergic and non-allergic children suggest that exposure to different microbiome compositions can lead to repertoire differences associated with differential disease susceptibility. Whether this type of observation will be expanded to additional disease settings remains to be established, but it is nevertheless possible that differential repertoire compositions influenced by microbiome homology could be exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic applications.",
