The annual incident and prevalent users of ACEIs, ARBs and overall renin-angiotensin drugs were examined. Box-Tiao intervention analysis was applied to assess the impact of price adjustments on monthly utilization of and expenditures on these drugs. ACEIs were divided into patented and off-patent drugs, off-patent ACEIs were further divided into original brands and generics, and subgroup analyses were performed. Results: The number of incident renin-angiotensin drug users decreased over the study period. The number of prevalent ARB users increased and exceeded the cumulative number of first-time renin-angiotensin drug users starting on ARBs, implying that some patients switched from ACEIs to ARBs. After price adjustments, long term trend increases in utilization were observed for patented ACEIs and ARBs; a long-term trend decrease was observed for off-patent ACEIs; long-term trend change was not significant for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Significant long-term trend increases in expenditures were observed for patented ACEIs after price adjustment in 2007 (200.9%, p = 0.0088) and in ARBs after price adjustments in 2001 (173.4%, p < 0.0001) and 2007 (146.3%, p < 0.0001). A significant long-term trend decrease in expenditures was observed for off-patent ACEIs after 2004 price adjustment (\u2212156.9%, p < 0.0001). Expenditures on overall renin-angiotensin drugs showed long-term trend increases after price adjustments in 2001 (72.2%, p < 0.0001) and 2007 (133.4%, p < 0.0001).",

This reimbursement price is paid to physicians, as they are responsible for purchasing, prescribing and dispensing in Taiwan [2] . However, physicians can purchase medications from pharmaceutical companies at the market trading price with a discount on the PBS reimbursement price. A profit margin for physicians then develops because of the difference between the reimbursement price and the market trading price; this is known as drug price deviation. Figure 1 provides an example of this pricing and payment structure. Under this reimbursement structure, physicians' prescribing decisions have been hypothesized to be influenced by the drug price deviation [3] .",

Annual pharmaceutical expenditures have doubled from 62.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NT$; at an exchange rate of NT$30.39 to US$1 on June 30, 2008) in 1996 to NT$131.3 billion in 2010 [1] , and the BNHI is under pressure to control outlays. Stepwise price adjustments (PA), which aim to reduce the reimbursement price to be close to the market trading price, is the major cost containment strategy adopted by the BNHI since 1996 [4] . In the early stage of price adjustments (1996) (1997) reimbursement price adjustments were based on the prices of international products or inter-brand comparison of existing products. On April 1, 2000 (PA2000), the BNHI began to conduct market price and volume surveys before each price adjustment, and adjusted the reimbursement price of each individual drug according to its weighted average market trading price (WAP) calculated from the market survey. Above the WAP, the BNHI allows a reasonable profit margin (known as the reasonable zone or \"r-zone\") for physicians. The \"r-zone\" for patented drugs has been higher than that for off-patent drugs since November 1, 2006 (PA2006). Since April 1, 2001 (PA2001), the BNHI has adopted different strategies for patented and off-patent drugs. The reimbursement prices of patented drugs are still adjusted based on the individual drug's WAP, but those of off-patent drugs are adjusted according to the principle of \"generic grouping\". Under this principle, drugs with the same active ingredients, content, and strength are grouped together; and their reimbursement prices are adjusted according to a group weighted average price (GWAP) calculated from their market trading prices. The Additional file 1 provides the details of the PBS and an example to illustrate the pricing structure.",

Because several ACEIs were launched in Taiwan before 1997, and their off-patent products heavily dominated the market share over time, they provide an ideal example for obtaining knowledge about the longitudinal changes in medication utilization and expenditures under stepwise price adjustments. Furthermore, because ARBs are generally more expensive than ACEIs, but are therapeutically similar to ACEIs, we are able to compare the impact of price adjustments on the two classes.

In subgroup analyses, the monthly utilization of and expenditures on ACEIs were categorized into patented drugs (benazepril, cilazapril, imidapril, perindopril and ramipril) and off-patent drugs (captopril, off-patent from PA2003; enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril and quinapril, off-patent from PA2006). The offpatent ACEIs were further categorized into original branded and generic versions. Potential independent variables included a constant (baseline level); a baseline trend; two indicator variables for each price adjustment, namely level change (the immediate effect) and trend change (the long-term effect or changes over time) [14] ; and three confounding factors. One of the three confounding factors was the global budget system implemented in Taiwan's hospitals on July 1, 2002 (GB2002) that increased outpatient use of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive agents [15] , and increased expenditures on all PBS listed drugs [5] . The other two confounding factors were the Chinese New Year (CNY) [5, 16] and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [5] , both of which decreased expenditures on all PBS listed drugs. When modeling each dependent variable, we removed a number of potential independent variables representing the cut-points of price adjustments, and only selected some of them to incorporate into the model (a so-called parsimonious model). These independent variables were initially selected using a backward elimination procedure. Collinearity diagnostics were subsequently performed to remove variables until the condition index was less than 30 [13, 17] . ARIMA modeling expressed in factored form [13] was applied to the residuals. Several candidate models were considered according to the autocorrelation plots and partial autocorrelation plots. The model with the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was chosen as the best fit. The Ljung-Box chisquare statistic revealed insignificant autocorrelation for the residuals [13] . All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC) with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant.",

            "text": "There are two major findings in our study. One is that the increase in prevalent ARB users is associated with switching from being an ACEI user. This result is consistent with the long-term trend increases in utilization of ARBs, but a long-term trend decrease in utilization of ACEIs. The other is that the increase in expenditures on renin-angiotensin drugs throughout this study primarily resulted from increases in the number of incident ARB users and potential switching from ACEIs to ARBs, but not from changes in the use of overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Ultimately, cost savings have not been achieved in overall use of renin-angiotensin drugs. Our findings differ from those of previous studies that showed cost savings in pharmaceutical expenditures for all PBS listed drugs [5] and generic substitution driven by the financial incentive for physicians [6] after price adjustments. As mentioned, a feature of Taiwan's health care system is that physicians both prescribe and dispense drugs because they are permitted by Taiwan's Department of Health to hire pharmacists to work at their on-site pharmacies [2] . Physicians stand to profit from the gap between the reimbursement price and the market trading price. In 2009, Liu et al. [6] conducted a study in Taiwan to investigate prescribing preferences between original branded and generic drugs in relation to this potential profit margin, and found that prescribing of generics increased as the reimbursement price decreased. Our results were only consistent with these findings when we examined the change in utilization of off-patent ACEIs. We observed that the utilization of off-patent original branded ACEIs was lower than that of off-patent generic ACEIs since 2001. Although the initial upward trend in the use of off-patent generic ACEIs turned to a decreasing trend after the implementation of PA2005, the use of these drugs is still higher than that of off-patent original branded drugs. However, our findings differ to those of Liu et al. when looking at both ACEIs and ARBs. Since these two classes of drugs work through the same renin-angiotensin pathway and have a similar effect in cardiovascular disease and renal protection [7] , physicians make a prescribing decision between ACEIs and ARBs when the patient needs a renin-angiotensin drugs. We observed that, following PA2006, the initial rising trend of the use of ACEIs turned to a decreasing trend, primarily due to the decreases in the use of off-patent ACEIs. The initial rising trend of the use of ARBs further increased following PA2003 and PA2007, and the use of ARBs exceeded that of ACEIs from 2007. In fact, the profit margin from patented and off-patent drugs varies over time, depending on when a drug turned from patented (applying WAP adjustment) to off-patent (applying GWAP adjustment) as well as the value of the r-zone (the accessible profit margin for physicians) imposed by the BNHI. Because the extent of WAP adjustment for patented drugs is smaller than that of the GWAP adjustment for off-patent drugs, and because the r-zone is larger for patented drugs than for offpatent drugs, patented drugs offer higher financial incentive to physicians through stepwise price adjustments.",

Evidence from the Netherlands showed that, after the implementation of the RP scheme, the cost of drugs covered by the RP scheme increased less than predicted, but the cost of drugs outside of the RP scheme has increased annually [19] .

It is noteworthy that a difference between ARBs and ACEIs may be the persistent coughing caused by ACEIs. Patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs often switch to ARBs. No differences in the clinical recommendations for ARBs and ACEIs were noted during the study period [7] . Further analyses are warranted to compare the effectiveness and economic outcome for patients treated with ACEIs, those treated with ARBs, and those who switched from ACEIs to ARBs.",

First, the baseline disease severity which led to initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs was not compared, and we were unable to distinguish the clinical appropriateness of stopping or switching drugs for individual patients. The assessment of clinical conditions using ICD9-CM codes is likely to minimize most, but not all, of the potential bias. Second, there was no control group in this study, because price adjustments were implemented nationwide concurrently. However, the time points in the pre-intervention period served as a control group for the post-intervention period in the intervention analysis. Thus, issues regarding internal validity (such as history and maturation) were taken into consideration [14] . Finally, because the time period between price adjustments is quite short, incorporating each price adjustment's level change and trend change into the intervention model would show severe multicollinearity, and it would be difficult to achieve significance for the collinearity parameters. That is why some previous studies only examined the level change, but not the trend change. However, since the trend change represents the long-term effect of policy interventions, its implication is greater than what the level change can explain and so it cannot be ignored. Therefore, we adopted a parsimonious model instead of a full model [14] , keeping only the significant predictors selected by a backward elimination procedure and collinearity diagnostics. In this way, the long-term effect of the price adjustments can be examined and the multicollinearity problem can be avoided.",
