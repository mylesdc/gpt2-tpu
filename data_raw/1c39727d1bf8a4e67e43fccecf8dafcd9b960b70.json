Current vaccines are restricted to inactivated vaccine strains and their related variants. In this study, a recombinant H9N2 (H9N2-TM) strain with a replaced H3 hemagglutinin (HA) transmembrane (TM) domain was generated. Virus assembly and viral protein composition were not affected by the transmembrane domain replacement. Further, the recombinant TM-replaced H9N2-TM virus could provide better inter-clade protection in both mice and chickens against H9N2, suggesting that the H3-TM-replacement could be considered as a strategy to develop efficient subtypespecific H9N2 influenza vaccines.",

Hemagglutinin (HA) is recognized as the major surface antigen. It is critical for viral attachment and membrane fusion. These are key steps for virus's entre into cells and critical to further process of virus infection 11, 12 . Transmembrane (TM) domain of the HA protein serves as an anchor site and plays an important role in supporting viral fusion to the target membrane 13 . In acidic environment, substitution of the TM domain showed an abolishment of receptor binding and membrane fusion, leading to a failure of virus entry into the cells 14, 15 . In addition, this domain was found to be important for biological characteristics of the influenza viruses, such as viral replication, virulence and pathogenicity [16] [17] [18] .

We found the TM-replaced virus (H9N2-TM) formed smaller plaques than the recombinant wildtype virus (H9N2-WT) ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting a slow viral replication due to the transmembrane (TM) domain replacement in cells. This was further confirmed when growth curves was measured that the pfu titers of recombinant H9N2-TM were lower than that of H9N2-WT (Fig. 2B) . The pfu titers of H9N2-TM were significantly decreased at 24 h (p < 0.01), 36 h (p < 0.05) and 48 h (p < 0.05) post-infection, suggesting TM-replacement may have an effect on delaying virus replication. When inoculated in chicken embryos, the H9N2-WT showed 8.17 log 10 EID 50 /0.1 ml for virus titer, while the recombinant H9N2-TM showed 6.5 log 10 EID 50 /0.1 ml (Fig. 2C) , indicating a low infectivity of H9N2-TM in chicken embryos.

Since the discovery of a series of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, the majority of which target to highly conserved region of HA stem, researchers began to discuss the potential to induce broad protective immunity [23] [24] [25] [26] . Various attempts were conducted to stabilize the HA stem in order to induce broad protective immunity. The stability and immunogenicity of the stabilized HA proteins through fusion with trimerization sequences have shown increased broad protective immunity. For instance, researchers showed when the HA protein was fused to the foldon domain of fibritin from bacterial phage T4 or GCN4p trimerization repeat, the fusion proteins showed increased stability and cross-reactive immunity 27, 28 . Further researchers showed that fused ectodomain of HA protein to ferritin could form nanoparticles and the nanoparticle vaccine could improve the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity 29 , suggesting the importance of HA protein stability in enhancing cross-protection. This plausible correlation of the major surface antigen stability and cross-immunity was also supported by other researches using S protein of SARS virus that the trimerized forms could elicit higher levels of neutralizing antibodies 30 .

The elicited HA-specific antibody level was comparable in both H7N9 20 and H9N2 viruses, when TM-replacement was introduced in the vaccine strains. Therefore, our results have suggested a universal technique to improve the existing influenza H9N2 inactivated virus vaccine. Furthermore, according to our researches, this technique could be used to develop vaccines of various types of avian influenza viruses. This TM-replacement technique suggests a way to improve the existing vaccine immune broad-spectrum activity, prolong the shelf life of the vaccine. And therefore, it is a good candidate for prevention of avian influenza and the development of new generation of vaccines in the future.",

Our results demonstrate that the TM-replaced vaccine could be a more effective influenza vaccine candidate and thus suggest a strategy to develop effective subtype-specific H9N2 vaccine or even heterosubtypic vaccines against influenza viruses. Other questions like whether the effect of TM-replacement is H3 specific, which segment is responsible for transmembrane domain function, whether TM-replacement changes the virus structure and how TM-replacement influences virus's biological characteristics still remain unknown. And future work is required to answer these questions. Virus rescue and reverse genetics. The plasmid pHW2000 was used for reserve genetics as described previously 34 . To construct recombinant H9N2 virus containing a TM from H3 HA, strain A/Chicken/ Guangdong/69/2009 (H9N2) (GenBank accession no. KF514116.1) was selected and the TM domain was replaced with a TM from H3 HA using overlap PCR (Fig. 1A) . For virus rescue, 293T cells were transfected with eight genome-sense plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instruction. Thirty six hours after transfection, TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added to the cells with a final concentration of 0.5-1 \u03bcg/ml. The transfected cell culture supernatant was collected at 48-60 h post-transfection and used to passage onto 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs for the propagation of the recombinant viruses. The rescued recombinant virus containing WT HA was designated as H9N2-WT, whereas the rescued virus containing H3 HA was designated as H9N2-TM.",
