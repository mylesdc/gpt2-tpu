The sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1h, washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-Rat antibodies for 1h. Coimmunofluorescence studies were carried out by incubating slides with anti-CD11b-FITC or anti-CD45-FITC followed by biotinylated anti-F4/80 antibodies. The slides were then incubated with DyLight 594conjugated streptavidin. The sections were then washed and incubated with DAPI for 2 min and mounted with cover slip in ProLong gold antifade reagent. TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IFN\u03b2 and IL6 levels in plasma harvested from mice following inflammatory challenges were determined using ELISA kits (eBioscience or PBL Interferon Source) following manufacturer's recommendations. Cytokine levels in plasma of mice induced with acute pancreatitis were analyzed by Luminex technology using the Milliplex Mouse Cytokine-Chemokine panel at the Luminex Core Facility of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (Bhattacharya et al., 2011) .",

Red blood cells were lysed using the RBC lysis buffer (155mM NH 4 Cl, 12mM KHCO 3 , and 0.1mM EDTA) for 5 minutes and remaining leukocytes were washed with PBS and analyzed as outlined below. Peritoneal cells were stained with viability dye, washed and stained with a cocktail containing APC-Cy7 labeled antibodies against anti-CD45, biotinylated antibodies against mouse IFNAR1 or biotinylated isotype control antibodies. Cells were then washed and stained with phycoerythrin conjugated streptavidin. Splenocytes (as a single cell suspension) were first incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer, washed and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For pSTAT1 staining cells were permeabilized with 90% methanol and incubated with primary antibodies against pSTAT1 followed by anti-rabbit AF488. All cells were analyzed using LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).",

Assays for complex I and cytochrome oxidase were carried out as described (Birch-Machin and Turnbull, 2001 ) using a Cary UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. Briefly, complex I activity (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was measured by incubating 50 \u03bcg of freeze-thawed mitochondrial extract in 1ml of assay medium (25mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5mM magnesium chloride, 2mM sodium cyanide, 2.5mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13mM NADH, 65\u03bcM ubiquinone and 2\u03bcg/ml antimycin A) and measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH oxidation. Cytochrome oxidase activity was measured by incubating 5\u03bcg of freeze-thawed mitochondrial extract in 1mL of assay medium (25mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.45mM dodecyl maltoside and 15mM reduced cytochrome c) and measuring the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm due to cytochrome c oxidation.",
