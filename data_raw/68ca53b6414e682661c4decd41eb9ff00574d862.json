            "text": "The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes severe central nervous system diseases and cycles between Culex mosquitoes and different vertebrates. For JEV and some other flaviviruses, oronasal transmission is described, but the mode of infection is unknown. Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells (NEC) at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs. Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines, indicating infection and replication in macrophages. Moreover, macrophages stimulated by alarmins, including interleukin-25, interleukin-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, were more permissive to the JEV infection. Altogether, our data are important to understand the mechanism of nonvector-borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs. IMPORTANCE JEV, a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito-waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs, which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes, leading to increased human cases. JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors. Moreover, virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium. Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three-dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus. Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages, which is favored by epithelial-cell-derived cytokines. The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of JEV.",

            "text": "Pigs are highly susceptible to JEV infection and rapidly develop viremia, which can last for a few days, during which they can transmit the virus to mosquitoes (4, 6) . Infected pigs normally present mild neurological symptoms, but the infection of pregnant sows can cause abortions and stillbirth (7) . Although JEV infection is typically mosquito borne, contact transmission and high susceptibility to oronasal infection have been described (8) . Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that JEV can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs, independently of the route of inoculation, for a period of 5 days, with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of viremia (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Furthermore, mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions (13) . These findings represent a warning that JEV could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito-free periods. In fact, a reemergence of JEV in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan (14) . It is also important to note that vector-free transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses is not restricted to JEV and pigs. Several species, including macaques, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and squirrel hamsters, are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV (15) (16) (17) . In addition, nonvector-borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses (18, 19) . Examples are Zika virus (ZIKV) (20, 21) , West Nile virus (WNV) (22, 23) , St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (24) , Bagaza virus (BAGV) (25) , Tembusu virus (TMUV) (26) , and Wesselsbron virus (WESSV) (27) .",

            "text": "Considering these observations, the present study addressed the potential role of the nasal epithelium in contact transmission. Our hypothesis was based on the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia indicating local virus replication (9) . While JEV is also found in tonsils (8, 9, 12) , immune animals' tonsils were found to be protected from infection, indicating that this organ is infected only following viremia (9) and would therefore not represent the point of JEV entry. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasal epithelium as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelium (11) . We therefore investigated whether the nasal epithelium can be infected from the apical surface and whether this infection would cause both apical and basolateral virus shedding. This would indeed represent a prerequisite for the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract to play a role in direct transmission of JEV. The present work included ex vivo and in vitro experimental models as porcine nasal explants and well-differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells (NEC) cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). In fact, our data demonstrate that JEV has the ability of infecting apically, resulting in both apical and basolateral virus shedding in swine nasal epithelial cells and indicating that the porcine nasal mucosa could represent a gateway for JEV entry and exit in pigs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that epithelial cells release soluble factors favoring subsequent infections of macrophages known to be present in the lamina propria of the mucosa.",

To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side, we utilized well-differentiated ALI cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa. These experiments showed that both JEV strains infected cultures from the apical side, resulting in virus replication (Fig.  2) . Again, the Laos strain showed statistically significantly higher levels of viral RNA than the Nakayama strain. Despite that, the two JEV strains tested displayed similar replication profiles, reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . To test for apical and/or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection, we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC. The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both JEV strains (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts (Fig. 2C) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection. With respect to RNA levels, the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. At 72 hpi, as shown in Fig. 2D , we visualized JEV infection of NEC by labeling of virus (E protein, green), nuclei (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride [DAPI], dark blue), tight junctions (ZO-1, light blue), and cilia (\u2424-tubulin, red). While we observed mainly isolated E protein-positive cells for the Nakayama strain, the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein-positive cells (Fig. 2D) and colocalization of E protein and \u2424-tubulin signals, suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. 2E) . Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 /sample for 2 h, followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h. In panel A, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), cilia with anti-\u2424-tubulin (red), and JEV with anti-E protein 4G2 (green). The scale bar represents 10 m. Three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. In panel B, a higher magnification of panel A is shown. In panel C, viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75% interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P \u0545 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without or with apostrophe for JEV Laos and Nakayama strain, respectively); significant differences between distinct JEV strains at the same time postinfection are shown by an asterisk.",

Following infection of airway epithelial cells by respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, several proinflammatory cytokines are induced, including interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), IL-6, IL-8, and interferon lambda 1 to 3 (IFN-s) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) .

Nevertheless, at the protein levels no virus-induced IL-1\u2424, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was detected at any of the time points tested (data not shown).

To also assess potential additional factors released from the infected NEC cultures, we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from Vero cell-propagated virus. Of note, the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection (MOI).",

Some of these reports are from experimental studies, and others are from field observations, laboratory infections, or infections of exposed health care providers or animal caretakers. Despite this multitude of reports, nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission. For nonlaboratory exposures, a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine. In fact, this has been described in many of the references previously cited, but the source of virus and first target remained unknown.",

In addition, epithelial cells also contribute to innate antiviral responses through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and IFNs (55) (56) (57) . To also address mucociliary activities, we used well-differentiated primary NEC cultures and demonstrated that JEV infects epithelial cells from nasal mucosal explants as well as NEC cultures (summarized in Fig. 10 ). Despite the fact that respiratory viruses are normally shed only apically and rarely basolaterally, JEV is shed to both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelial cells and such an infection could thus mediate virus entry into the host as well as oronasal virus spread to other hosts in a manner principally comparable to that of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus. Our in vitro results complements previously published in vivo findings, which can explain the high efficiency of JEV infection of pigs via the oronasal route and are in line with different experiments which showed oronasal shedding several days beyond the end of viremia, and they additionally can explain the detection of high levels of JEV RNA in nasal mucosa, which can last up to 10 days after challenge (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The in vivo relevance of the presented data is further supported by the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia (9), pointing to a local cellular source for virus replication, which is also supported by a recent study in which the larger JEV RNA amount was detected in nasal mucosa (11) .",

As for IFN-s, which are important mucosal antiviral factors produced by respiratory epithelial cells, we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level, confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium, which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract. This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on NEC and by the observed induction of SOCS1, a potent negative regulator of the IFN pathway and consequently also of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (61) .

This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection, which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area. In fact, MDM were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by IL-4 polarization. This is relevant, as such a polarization could also be induced following JEV infection of NEC through the release of alarmins, such as IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, from stressed and dying epithelial cells (42) (43) (44) (45) . These alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which promote M2-like macrophage polarization (62) (63) (64) (65) . In fact, our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages.

Our data are of relevance to understanding the mechanism of direct transmission for JEV and potentially other flaviviruses. Although the present work does not provide final proof that the respiratory epithelium represents the port of entry and exit during direct transmission events of JEV, our results represent an important basis for further in vivo investigations to confirm the cellular tropism of JEV and the kinetics of events during infection of pigs via the respiratory tract.",

Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer (CB; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0.1% saponin in PBS \u03ea/\u03ea ) for 30 min and then incubated with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h. After 3 washes with CB, the tissue was incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-\u2424tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of cilia. Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS \u03ea/\u03ea and incubated in 4% PFA for 15 min. In the second step, the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher) and anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-\u2424-tubulin (Abcam). For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC, Abcam's Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit (Fluorometric-Blue)-CytoPainter was applied for 30 min, and then cells were washed with PBS \u03ea/\u03ea and fixed with 4% PFA, followed by an incubation with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 as described before and labeling with phalloidin conjugated with AF555 (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 (C-Cas3) staining, apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with anti-human CD90 (5E10; Becton, Dickinson). For detection of apoptotic cells, inserts were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min, incubated with anti-C-Cas3 (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h, washed, and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647, Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark. For each staining, 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) at 2 g/ml was applied for 5 min at 37\u00b0C and washed off with PBS \u03ea/\u03ea . Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Sigma). For confocal microscopy analysis, a confocal microscope A1 (Nikon AG) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) and digital imaging Nikon software (AR 3.30.02) were used. The image acquisitions were performed with the 40\u03eb objective, sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed; in order to give high-resolution images, the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold. The images were analyzed with Imaris 8.0.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive emissions, different settings were applied, including background subtraction, threshold applications, gamma correction, and maxima. Insert surface staining (for E protein, CytoPainter, and C-Cas3) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy.",

For viral titrations, differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis, and for individual differences the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was employed. For the rest of the comparisons, such as differences between groups in the percentage of infected cells or gene expression levels, we employed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A P value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
