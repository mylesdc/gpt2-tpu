Healthcare workers (HCWs) form a significant risk group for infection. Objectives: The aim of this survey was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, infection control practices and educational needs of HCWs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to MERS coronavirus and other emerging infectious diseases. Methods: 1500 of HCWs from Saudi Ministry of Health were invited to fill a questionnaire developed to cover the survey objectives from 9 September 2015 to 8 November 2015. The response rate was about 81%. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise the responses. Results: 1216 HCWs were included in this survey. A total of 56.5% were nurses and 22% were physicians. The most common sources of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) memo (74.3%).",

Around half of respondents who having been investigated for MERS-CoV reported that their work performance decreased while they have suspicion of having MERS-CoV and almost two thirds reported having psychological problems during this period. Almost two thirds of the HCWs (61.2%) reported anxiety about contracting MERS-CoV from patients. Conclusions: The knowledge about emerging infectious diseases was poor and there is need for further education and training programs particularly in the use of personal protective equipment, isolation and infection control measures. The self-reported infection control practices were sub-optimal and seem to be overestimated.",

The survey was administered on paper in either Arabic or English according to respondent preference. The responses entered into an electronic database for analysis. The content areas included MERS coronavirus knowledge and sources of information; personal experiences with MERS-CoV; opinions about the location of management of patients with emerging infectious diseases; attitudes of the HCWs to infection control practices; the educational needs of the HCWs about emerging infectious diseases; and self-reported infection control practices of the HCWs. All responses were anonymous. A Chi Square test was used to compare differences in the proportions of categorical variables. Significance was determined at the 0.05 threshold.",

The infection control measures are very crucial for respiratory infectious cases in the healthcare institutes [11] . A high proportion of respondents identified hospital overcrowding, poor hand hygiene and mask use, lack of knowledge about the mode of transmission, a lack of policies and procedures, and insufficient training in infection control procedures also contributed to the risk of spread.
