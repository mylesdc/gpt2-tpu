            "text": "Innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection, and in turn, viruses have evolved to evade host immune surveillance. As a result, viruses may persist in host and develop chronic infections. Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are among the most potent antiviral cytokines triggered by viral infections. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease of pigs that is characterized by negligible induction of type I IFNs and viral persistence for an extended period. For IFN production, RIG-I/MDA5 and JAK-STAT pathways are two major signaling pathways, and recent studies indicate that PRRS virus is armed to modulate type I IFN responses during infection. This review describes the viral strategies for modulation of type I IFN responses. At least three non-structural proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp11) and a structural protein (N nucleocapsid protein) have been identified and characterized to play roles in the IFN suppression and NF-\u03baB pathways. Nsp's are early proteins while N is a late protein, suggesting that additional signaling pathways may be involved in addition to the IFN pathway. The understanding of molecular bases for virus-mediated modulation of host innate immune signaling will help us design new generation vaccines and control PRRS.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases affecting the swine industry worldwide. The disease was first observed in the USA in 1987 and then in Germany in 1990 [1] . The clinical signs include reproductive failures, including late-term abortions, increased number of stillborn and mummified fetuses in sows, and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages. The etiology of PRRS was first determined in 1990 in the Netherlands and named Lelystad virus (LV) [1] . Shortly after, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) VR2332 was isolated in the USA and shown to be the sole causative agent for PRRS [1, 2] . Comparative genomic sequence analyses reveal the genetic differences between LV and VR2332 and accordingly PRRS viruses are grouped into two genotypes; European (Type I) and North American (Type II) types [3, 4] . A highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) emerged in China in 2006 and was thought to be a mutant belonging to the North American type. Clinical studies show that the affected animals develop high fever, depression, anorexia, dyspnoea, reddening of the skin, edema of the eyelids, mild diarrhea, shivering, limping, and unusually high morbidity (50%-100%) and mortality (20%-100%) in pigs of all ages [5] .",

The Arteriviridae family, along with the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae families, comprise the order Nidovirales [6] [7] [8] [9] . The PRRSV genome consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA of 15 Kb in size, encoding 10 ORFs: ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs 3 through 7, plus the newly identified ORF5a [10, 11] . ORF1a and ORF1b code for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1a/b, with expression of the latter by ribosomal frame-shifting [12, 13] . Pp1a and pp1a/b are proteolytically processed into 14 nonstructural proteins (Nsp's) by the papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) in Nsp1, poliovirus 3C-like cysteine protease (CP) in Nsp2, and serine protease (SP) in Nsp4. Nsp3 through Nsp12 are cleaved by SP, and PCP generates Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u00df, while CP generates Nsp2 [14] . ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3 through ORF7, and ORF5a code for seven structural proteins: glycoprotein (GP) 2, small envelop (E), GP3, GP4, GP5, membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and the newly identified ORF5a protein [15, 16] . GP5 and M form a dimer, and GP2, GP3, and GP4 form a hetero-trimer that may facilitate the virus entry [17, 18] . N protein binds to the viral genome RNA and also interacts with itself to form the core capsid by homo-oligomerization during the viral particle assembly [19, 20] . Some of the PRRSV proteins are multi-functional and shown to play modulatory roles for host innate immunity [14, 21] . Interferons (IFN) are potent immune responsive cytokines against invading viruses, and their modulations by PRRSV have recently been studied. Although their precise mechanisms of action remain to be further elucidated, PRRSV exhibits significant inhibition of type I IFN production in both virus-infected cells and pigs. The current review summarizes the innate immune signaling pathways of host and discusses the current knowledge as to how PRRSV interferes with the type I IFN signaling pathways in particular.",

Type I IFNs are the main cytokines for innate immunity against viral infections and include various subtypes depending on the animal species. Type I IFNs in humans consists of 13 subtypes for IFN-\u03b1 and a single subtype for IFN\u00df, -\u03c9, -\u03ba, and -\u03b5 [22] . Limitin/IFN-like 1 is an additional type I IFN-like cytokine recently identified in mice that also binds the type I IFN receptor [23] . Similar to humans, IFN-\u03b1 in swine is encoded by as many as 17 functional genes. The IFN-\u03b4-like molecule is found only in pigs and cattle and designated SPI IFN [24, 25] . IFN-\u03b3 is the sole representative of type II IFN. While type I IFNs are produced in most cell types in response to different viruses, type II IFN is produced by limited types of cells including natural killer (NK) cells, activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neurons. Type III IFNs have recently been described as containing 3 subtypes IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3, but their role in antiviral defense remains to be established [22] . Since type I IFNs are the most notable cytokines in the fight against viral infection at an early stage, a focus will be given to discuss how they are produced in virus-infected cells and act on neighbor cells to prevent the spread of virus ( Figure 1 ).",

Double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and CpG DNA are recognized by TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9, respectively, in the endosomes, which leads to the dimerization of receptors and recruitment of TRIF or MyD88. The stimulation results in the assembly of signaling complexes and initiation of signaling cascades leading to the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3/IRF7, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1. Once activated, these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus, and together with CBP, induce the transcription of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Activation of RIG-I/MDA5 by viral RNA may be inhibited by LGP2. Both RIG-I and MDA5 activates IPS-1 through the CARD domain. IPS-1 then induces signaling pathways resulting in the activation of IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB through different adaptors and kinases. IPS-1 signaling also likely involves the MAP kinase cascade for activation of AP-1. The nuclear signal of IRF3/IRF7, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1 is similar to that of TLR. Once IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are secreted extracellularly outside the cell after production, they bind to IFN receptors on itself (autocrine) or neighbor cells (paracrine), the receptor associated JAK1 kinase is phosphorylated and activated to recruit STAT1 and STAT2 through their SH2 domain for phosphorylation. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 are detached from the IFN receptors and associated each other to form ISGF3 complexes along with IRF9. ISGF3 then undergoes nuclear translocation and binds to ISRE to induce the transcription of hundreds of ISGs. Five major kinds of ISGs are listed here; MxA, OAS-1/RNaseL, RIG-I/MDA5, ISG15, and PKR. For their modes of action, see the text. Grey circle indicates the lysine-48-linked ubiquitin chain which leads to the degradation of proteins. Yellow circle indicates phosphorylation.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been investigated extensively in the past few years and a considerable progress has been made for mammalian TLRs and their functions. TLRs are a family of proteins recognizing different pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMPs). The key signaling domain unique to the TLR system is the toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain located in the cytosolic face of each TLR and also in the adapters [26] . Once engaged to TLRs, PAMPs recruit different kinases through different adaptors by the TIR domain and thus trigger different signaling pathways, leading to the expression of specific genes that are involved in the removal of invading viruses. Ten TLRs have so far been identified for humans and 11 TLRs for mice [27] . Of these, TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are discussed in this review since they contribute the most to the control of virus infection [28] . Most cell types express TLR3 in the intracellular endosomes, except human fibroblast in which TLR3 is found to act on the cell surface [29] . TLR3 mediates the response to both poly(I:C) and dsRNA [30, 31] . After stimulation, the TIR domain of TLR3 binds to the TIR-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-\u00df (TRIF) which indirectly activates several transcription factors including NF (nuclear factor)-\u03baB, IRF (interferon regulation factor) 3, and AP (activating protein)-1 [32] . To mediate IRF3 activation, the N-terminal domain of TRIF associates with TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK-1)/I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK-\u03b5) through NF-\u03baB activating kinase (NAK)-associated protein 1 (NAP1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) to phosphorylate IRF3, which then forms a dimer to translocate to the nucleus for IFN-\u00df expression [32] . For NF-\u03baB activation, TRIF binds to TRAF6 and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). TRAF6 is an ubiquitin ligase and thus ubiquitinylation of RIP1 by TRAF6 is recognized by TAK (transforming growth factor \u00df-activating kinase) binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, leading to activation of TAK1 and then phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u00df. These two activated kinases then phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1 which undergoes degradation by ubiquitinylation and releases NF-\u03baB to the nucleus [33] . TAK-1 also activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of the members of the AP-1 family [32] , which also triggers IFN-\u00df gene transcription.",

            "text": "TLR7/8 recognize dsRNA as short as 19-21 bps in size. TLR7/8 are constitutively expressed at high levels in specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). TLR7 in human is highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) whereas TLR8 is mainly found in monocytes [34] . TLR9 senses unmethylated CpG DNA in the genome in DNA viruses, which induces the production of type I IFN in pDCs [35] . All three TLRs are anchored on the endosomal membranes [28] . Different from TLR3 which uses TRIF as a primary adaptor, TLR7/8/9 use MyD88 to induce IFN expression [36] . For TLR7/8, the signaling starts with the MyD88 binding to TRAF6 and IRAK-1 (IL-1 reporter associated kinase 1). This complex leads to the IRF-5 and IRF-7 activation [37] . Similarly, TLR9 also causes MyD88 to interact with IRF7 with the help of a kinase complex containing TRAF6 and IRAK-1 or IRAK-4. For different functions in different cell types, different family members of IRAK are involved. In pDCs, IRAK-1 is required while IRAK-4 is responsible in HEK cells [38] . Interestingly, IRF7 can also interact with either MyD88 or TRAF6 [39] . For IRF7 activation, the IRF7/IRAK-1 complex leads to the IRAK-1-mediated IRF7 phosphorylation. The phosphorylated IRF7 then dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus mainly for IFN-\u03b1 expression. In this process, IKK\u03b1, which is known to participate in the NF-\u03baB activation, is essential. Thus, the IRAK4-IRAK1-IKK\u03b1 kinase cascades may lead to the IRF7 activation [39] . In summary, the TLR7/8 and TLR9 pathways in the endosome activate IRF7 through MyD88 and account for production of IFN-\u03b1 in pDCs, which plays a crucial role during virus infection. The TLR3-mediated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation through TRIF is an additional scenario to induce IFN-\u00df gene expression, which may present an alternative role in anti-viral immunity, especially for RNA viruses including PRRSV.",

It contains a C-terminal DExD/H box-RNA helicase domain and two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) through which RIG-I induces type I IFN. Only RNA molecules that can be efficiently recognized and unwound by the helicase domain of RIG-I have the potential to induce type I IFN through CARD. Therefore, the helicase domain of RIG-I acts as a switch to control whether CARD is revealed and available for activation of downstream processes [34] . Once the CARD domain of RIG-I is uncovered by conformational changes under stimulation, another CARD-containing protein IFN-\u00df promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) is recruited as an adaptor through CARD-CARD interaction. The CARD-CARD interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1 is essential for dsRNA-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, IRF3, and IRF7 [40] . For IRFs activation, IPS-1 transduces signals through TRAF3, a signaling factor involved in the TLR-activation pathway, which in the case of the RIG-I-IRF pathway associates with NEMO and TANK to facilitate the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 to form the IPS-1-TRAF complex. This complex leads to TBK1/IKK\u03b5 activation, which then phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7. Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 form homo-or hetero-dimer and are transported to the nucleus. For NF-\u03baB activation, IPS-1 interacts with TRAF2, TRAF6, and RIP1, which is similar to TLR3-activated NF-\u03baB activation [38] . Once in the nucleus, the active form of IRF3 or IRF7, NF-\u03baB, AP-1, together with other co-transcription factors, such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) form an IFN enhanceosome to produce IFN-\u00df and IFN-\u03b1 [39] .",

Gene-knockout studies show that RIG-I and TLR pathways mediate different antiviral signaling in different cell types. The ability to induce IFN-\u00df is severely compromised in RIG-I knockout conventional DCs and fibroblasts, whereas the IFN-\u00df induction is absolutely normal in RIG-I knockout plasmacytoid DCs, but not in the absence of MyD88 and TRIF [41] . Overall, RIG-I and TLR pathways are not redundant, but rather sense the virus in multiple ways in different cell types so that the host can fight against the virus more efficiently. Besides RIG-I, MDA5 and LPG2 have also been identified as DExD/H box RNA helicase that functions in the antiviral immune response. Like RIG-I, MDA5 contains two N-terminal CARD domains and promote the IFN-\u00df induction. In contrast, LPG2 lacks the CARD domain and thus is considered as a negative regulator in the RIG-I pathway [42, 43] .",

Studies show that MDA5 is essential for the recognition of picornaviruses and poly(I:C) [45, 46] . RIG-I is required for the recognition of many negative-strand RNA viruses including Sendai virus and influenza A virus, and poly(I:C) is often used to stimulate the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway [46] . Compared to MDA5, RIG-I senses RNA transcribed in vitro by polymerases. Actually, both single-and double-strand RNA with a triphosphate moiety at the 5' end can activate type I IFN production via RIG-I [47, 48] . This leads to a crucial question 'How the host or such cytoplasmic receptors distinguish viral RNAs from self-RNAs'. The answer is not hard but complicated. Cellular RNAs like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) possess a 5' monophosphate instead of 5' triphosphate and thus would not be detected by RIG-I. For messenger RNA (mRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) however, the 5' end is modified with a methyl-guanosine cap which protects RNAs from degradation. In addition, cellular RNAs are often post-transcriptionally modified by pseudouridine, 2-thiouridine, or 2'-O-methylation, and these modifications suppress the immunestimulatory activity of RNA even if the RNA contains a 5' triphosphate [33, 48] . Last but not least, cellular RNA generally does not exist as \"naked\" molecules in a cellular environment but rather forms complexes with a multitude of RNA-binding proteins. Thus, it is conceivable that protein components of the complexes may also play a role in marking certain RNA species as 'self' [33] .",

PIAS1 and PIAS3 compete against STAT1 and STAT3 for ISRE within the promoter region, respectively, and thus suppress the expression of ISGs [51] . PIASy can recruit other factors to repress the transcription activities of STAT1. In addition to the negative regulation of STATs, PIAS is also identified as a SUMO E3 ligase. SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like modifier and many proteins are post-translationally modified by SUMO, which is a process known as sumoylation. Sumoylation occurs similarly to ubiquitinylation in such a way that a SUMO molecule is conjugated to its target protein through specific sequence recognition by E3 ligase [52] . Sumoylation plays roles in diverse biological processes including regulation of gene transcription, chromatin structure, protein localization and functions. SUMO E3 ligase is required for ubiquitinylation of certain proteins and mediates degradation.",

ISG15 is expressed as a 165-amino acid protein and processed to expose the C-terminal LRLRGG sequence. When this sequence is exposed in the case of ubiquitylation, ubiquitin is conjugated to its substrate by three enzymes; ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) [55] . For ISGylation, ISG15 is conjugated to its substrates by similar to or even the same enzyme. The E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme is specific for ISG15, whereas E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase possess the ability to conjugate and ligate both ubiquitin and ISG15. At least 158 putative ISG15 substrates have been identified and many of them play important roles for type I IFN responses including JAK1, STAT1, RIG-I, Mx1, and PKR functions [53] . Similar to ubiquitylation, ISGylation is also reversible. However, unlike the Lys48linked ubiquitin leading to proteasomal degradation, ISGylation parallels the K63-linked ubiquitin to recruit other proteins and modulates the function of enzymes. ISGylation can prevent virus-mediated IRF3 degradation [56] . ISG15 may also be secreted outside cells in a large amount and act as a cytokine to modulate immune responses [57] .",

During persistent infection, viremia is absent and viral replication sites are restricted primarily to lymphoid tissues and other immuneprivileged sites such as tonsils and lymph nodes [66, 67] . Persistence of PRRSV is also common in the semen of infected boars [68] . Virus shedding from persistently infected pigs is an important source for transmission and is one of the main factors that hinder the control of PRRSV infection in the field. Viral persistence may be the result of a poor immune response, including delayed production of neutralizing antibodies and suppression of innate immune responses.",

            "text": "Recent studies have described cytokine responses during PRRSV infection. In PRRSV-infected pigs, TNF-\u03b1 is down-regulated while IL-10 production is up-regulated. Pigs do not show typical innate immune responses including type I IFN response, although PRRSV is highly susceptible to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and its growth is inhibited. PRRSV-infected pigs display low levels of IFN-\u03b1 despite the abundant presence of viral RNA in infected cells. IFN-\u03b1 is not detectable in the lungs of virus-infected pigs where PRRSV actively replicates [69, 70] . The suppression of IFN production is also evident in virus-infected MARC-145 and PAM (porcine alveolar macrophage) cells [69, 71, 72] , suggesting that PRRSV suppresses IFN production. Such inhibition by PRRSV is RIG-I mediated [73] . In pigs infected with the newly emerged highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV), the virus replicates rapidly and readily persists. RNA microarray analysis of HP-PRRSV-infected cells shows that production of swine type I IFNs are suppressed, suggesting that the host innate immune response is blocked [5] . The European genotype of PRRSV has also been examined by microarray analysis for its ability to modulate global gene expression [74] . A repression of IFN-\u03b1 transcription and a delay of IFN-\u00df transcript accumulation in infected-microphages was shown. Here, we discuss below the manipulation of IFN signaling pathways by PRRSV during infection (Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "Although a large body of information is available for viral modulation of TLRs for humans, porcine TLRs are relatively poorly understood. TLR9 is expressed in Peyer's patches in pigs, and its expression is also stimulated in monocyte-derived dendritic cells [75] . Porcine TLR3 and TLR7 seem to be important for PRRSV [76, 77] , and porcine TLR8 has also been identified. Porcine TLR3 is highly expressed in kidney, duodenum, spleen, and liver, whereas porcine TLR7 is moderately expressed in bone marrows, intestines, spleen, livers, lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes, trachea, thymus, kidneys, and skin [77] . Differential expressions of TLRs have been studied for PAMs and porcine bone marrow hematopoietic cell-derived immature dendritic cells (imDCs) in response to poly(I:C) and PRRSV [78] . In unstimulated cells, expression levels of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 were higher in PAMs than in imDCs. Poly(I:C) tends to stimulate the TLR3 expression in PAMs but inhibits TLR7 and TLR8 expression. In contrast, PRRSV down-regulates TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 expression levels at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) in imDCs, which return to basal levels by 24 h p.i.. Interestingly, TLR7 expression decreased continuously through 24 h of infection. In other study, the TLR3 activation caused increased antiviral response to PRRSV and decreased viral replication [76] . TIR-domain truncated TLR3 was found to increase the PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells, while wild-type TLR3 inhibited PRRSV replication. Thus, TLR3 seems to play an important role in establishing effective innate immunity to PRRSV. Another study [79] using poly(I:C) as a TLR3-specific agonist and LPS as a TLR4-specific agonist showed that PRRSV infection increased IFN-\u03b1 expression at 16 h p.i. in PAMs, and this was an 8 h delay compared to poly(I:C) stimulation alone. No significant increase of IFN-\u03b1 was observed upon infection [79] . When PRRSV-infected cells are stimulated by poly(I:C) or LPS, TLR4 was not influenced but TLR3 was significantly reduced, and the TLR3 down-regulation facilitated virus replication. Figure 2 . The modulation of type I IFN production by PRRSV. PRRSV has been shown to reduce the expression of TLR3 and IRF7 in pDCs. While Nsp1 has the ability to degrade CBP in the nucleus, Nsp1\u03b1 subunit inhibits the I\u03baB phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. Nsp2 inhibits IFN production by blocking the ubiquitinylation of phosphorylated I\u03baB and phosphorylation of IRF3 through the OTU domain. Nsp11 suppresses IFN-\u03b2 production through degradation of IPS-1 mRNA. For the second wave of IFN signaling, PRRSV Nsp1\u03b2 blocks the phosphorylation of STATs and inhibits the nuclear translocation of ISGF3 complex. Nsp1 interacts with PIAS. Since PIAS is a multi-functional protein, Nsp1 interaction may also modulate pathways other than the JAK-STAT pathway. PKR is redistributed during PRRSV infection. Nsp2 has the potential to deconjugate ISGylation. The GP5 protein induces apoptosis. Since Nsp1 is cotranslationally processed to Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u03b2 in PRRSV-infected cells, the uncleaved form of Nsp1 is unlikely to exist in virus-infected cells. It is unknown which subunit of Nsp1 interacts with PIAS and degrades CBP. ",

Different from Nsp1 which is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, Nsp11 expression is mainly cytoplasmic suggesting its main function is in the cytoplasm. Nsp11 contains a domain designated the NendoU domain and functions as an endoribonuclease [82] . The NendoU domain consists of two subdomains; subdomain A and subdomain B. Subdomain A contains active sites for endoribonuclease activity, while subdomain B is thought to maintain the overall structure of Nsp11. We have been studying the role of Nsp11 for IFN regulation and have found that Nsp11 blocks the phosphorylation of both IRF3 and I\u03baB. This leads to the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, and as consequences, IFN production is inhibited. IPS-1 is an upstream component in the RIG-I pathway and is found to be degraded in Nsp11-expressing cells and PRRSV-infected cells (Figure 2 ). The IPS-1 degradation results in the inhibition of down-stream pathways which is likely the basis for suppression of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation by Nsp11. Using a series of NendoU mutants, the relationship between IPS-1 degradation and NendoU activities was examined and the results indicate that the Nsp11 endoribonuclease activity is associated with the degradation of IPS-1 mRNA.",

The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway may function as a protective response of the host to a virus, and thus, many viruses have evolved to block NF-\u03baB activation to evade host innate immunity. In this scenario, NF-\u03baB signaling is inhibited by PRRSV which suppresses a type I IFN response. However, a study shows that NF-\u03baB may be up-regulated by PRRSV at 36-48 h p.i. [83] . The NF-\u03baB activation during this time of infection was dose-dependent and replication-dependent since UV-inactivated PRRSV did not up-regulate the response. In porcine pDCs, PRRSV promotes NF-\u03baB phosphorylation when stimulated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [84] . The data show that PRRSV actually activates the NF-\u03baB pathway in MARC-145 cells and PAMs at a late stage of infection. Activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by viruses may optimize viral replication and control of host cell proliferations and apoptosis. However, blocking NF-\u03baB activation by over-expressing the dominant negative form of I\u03baB\u03b1 did not alter viral replication [73, 83] , suggesting that the activation of NF-\u03baB by PRRSV may be involved in other cellular progresses such as apoptosis or modulation of cytokines.",

Thus, it is plausible that NF-\u03baB activation may be linked to the N protein nuclear localization. The region is also important for homo-dimerization of N, which is embedded in the NF-\u03baB activation domain.

Using the NF-\u03baB and PRDII luciferase reporter constructs, Nsp1\u03b1 was determined to reduce the luciferase activities of both reporters 24 h post-transfection. In the presence of Nsp1\u03b1, the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was inhibited, leading to the block of NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Nsp1\u03b1 is the N-terminal subunit of Nsp1 and contains the PCP\u03b1 protease domain. A zinc finger motif is formed by four catalytic residues of histidine (H) or cysteine (C) to hold a zinc ion and is commonly found in transcription factors. PRRSV Nsp1\u03b1 contains two zinc finger motifs; one motif (ZF1) of C8-C10-C25-H28 and another motif (ZF2) of C70-C76-H146-M180. After cleavage, the PCP\u03b1 activity is self-inactivated by conformational changes and thus is less likely responsible for suppression of the IFN response. This suggests that two zinc finger motifs may be associated with Nsp1\u03b1-mediated IFN suppression. A deletion mutant of Nsp1\u03b1 lacking the C-terminal 14 amino acids, in which the second zinc finger motif is lost, shows no inhibition of IFN induction. This finding raises a possibility that zinc finger motifs of Nsp1\u03b1 may take a part in the suppression of NF-\u03baB or other type I IFN pathways. Using a series of mutant constructs, the first zinc finger motif has been mapped to be important for IFN regulation since the mutants containing the first zinc finger motif catalytic sites always reverse the IFN suppression [86] . Although it is unclear whether the CBP degradation by Nsp1 is mediated by Nsp1\u03b1 or Nsp1\u03b2, it is possible that the cytosolic form of Nsp1 blocks the NF-\u03baB activation and the nuclear form of Nsp1 degrades CBP possibly through the zinc finger domain.",

The ISGF3 nuclear translocation is blocked by PRRSV [89] . In TGEV-stimulated pDCs, the nuclear translocation of STAT1 is inhibited by PRRSV [84] , and Nsp1\u00df is the viral protein responsible for this inhibition. Nsp1\u00df, not Nsp1\u03b1, inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1 and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 [89, 90] . In our laboratory by yeast-two-hybrid assays, Nsp1\u03b1 has been found to interact with PIAS1 [91] . PIAS functions as a negative regulator for STAT1 and also as the SUMO E3 ligase. The interaction of Nsp1\u03b1 with PIAS1 may lead to the Nsp1\u03b1 sumoylation and facilitate the Nsp1\u03b1 transport into the nucleus. Besides, degradation of CBP by Nsp1 may also require the E3 ligase activity of PIAS. Nsp1 may bring CBP to PIAS1 and then CBP is sumoylated by PIAS1, which facilitates the ubiquitinylation of CBP for degradation.",

ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like molecule and can be reversibly conjugated to proteins to mediate important innate antiviral responses. The OTU domain in Nsp2 of PRRSV contains a deubiquinylation activity. Nsp2 can decrease ubiquitinylation and ISGylation in 293T cells, indirectly indicating that Nsp2 may help the virus evade the innate immune response by deconjugation [87] . Typically, PKR is found in the both cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions in cell, but its distribution is altered by increased signals in the perinuclear region and within the nucleoli of PRRSV-infected cells.

This is accompanied by a reciprocal activation of programmed cell death in virus-infected cells and the reduction of viral load in the host. Apoptotic cells are observed in PRRSV-infected tissues of pigs [93] , while in other studies, apoptotic cells are not PRRSV-infected [94, 95] . Based on the different observations, some researchers have reported that the GP5 protein expression induced apoptosis by acting downstream of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and mapped the apoptotic region to the N-terminal 119 amino acids of GP5 [96] . Other researchers however propose that 'bystander' cells undergo apoptosis during PRRSV infection supported by their microarray data in MARC-145 cells indicating that only minimal increases of pro-apoptotic gene transcripts in PRRSV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells [97] . Later, studies using porcine alveolar microphages [98] and monocyte-driven dendritic cells [99] reveal that it is the stage of virus infection that determines whether PRRSV-infected cells are towards anti-apoptosis or pro-apoptosis. At 8 h post-infection, the balance gears towards anti-apoptosis, but all infected cells will eventually die by both apoptosis and necrosis. The expression of viral proteins is necessary to induce a strong anti-apoptotic state and it is possible that non-structural proteins are involved in the apoptotic suppression since the PRRSV-mediated anti-apoptosis effect was already present before structural proteins were detectable in infected microphages [98] . As discussed earlier, both type I IFN production and virus-induced apoptosis are important defense mechanisms of a host against invading viruses and they both share common pathways. Therefore, it is possible that PRRSV may actively interfere with the induction of apoptosis, which may be partially due to its ability to inhibit type I IFN production, especially in the early stage of infection.",

In the present review, multiple strategies of PRRSV for manipulating TLR and RIG-I-mediated IFN production and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are discussed. During the intricate signaling processes, other pathways including the NF-\u03baB pathway are activated or inhibited by PRRSV. The N protein appears to activate the NF-\u03baB pathway and its nuclear localization and dimerization may be associated. Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp11 are identified to be responsible for viral immune-modulation and their domains and motifs for biological mechanisms have partially been studied at the molecular level. Nsp1 interferes with the IRF3-mediated IFN production in the nucleus and the NF-\u03baB-mediated pathway in the cytoplasm. For IFN signaling, the Nsp1\u00df subunit of Nsp1 suppresses the JAK-STAT pathway by blocking different steps in different cell types. Besides, Nsp1 (Nsp1\u03b1 subunit or Nsp1\u03b2 subunit, or both) interacts with PIAS1. Since PIAS is a nuclear protein with multiple functions, the interaction with PIAS opens a new direction of the host cellular modulation by Nsp1, which may or may not relate to IFN pathways. Nsp2 is involved in the blocking of IRF3 activation through the activity of PCP2 and reduces ubiquitinylation and ISGylation through the OTU domain. Nsp11 degrades IPS-1 mRNA via the NendoU domain and impedes the downstream IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation. Despite the progress made on the PRRSV-mediated modulation of innate immune responses, studies have mainly been conducted in MARC-145 which are cells derived from monkey kidney, or in PRRSV non-permissive cells such as HeLa, raising questions as to their relevance to natural infection. Some limited studies have been conducted in PAMs as the natural target cells and pigs as the natural host animal. Different PRRSV isolates differ in their sensitivity to IFN-\u03b1 and they also seem to have different abilities to down-regulate the IFN response [101] . Marked differences have been observed in different cell types for IFN-\u00df induction [102] . A vaccine strain of PRRSV does not exhibit sensitivity to IFN in MARC-145 cells, whereas both virulent PRRSV and the vaccine strain are sensitive to IFN in PAMs. The PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP) restored the virus replication in MARC-145 cells but did not rescue the virus in PAMs. In addition to different cell types and various virus isolates, different genetic breeds of pigs may yield different responses. PAMs from Landrace pigs inhibit or delay the PRRSV growth compared to those from other breeds of pigs [103] . The lack of knowledge on the mechanistic basis for how PRRSV evades host immune responses leads to an inadequate control of the disease. One of the key questions is whether the virulence of PRRSV is linked to immunosuppression. Identification of active sites for IFN modulation and generation of mutant PRRSV using infectious cDNA clones to eliminate the immune suppressive functions from the virus may be feasible ways to generate new and attenuated vaccines for PRRS.",
