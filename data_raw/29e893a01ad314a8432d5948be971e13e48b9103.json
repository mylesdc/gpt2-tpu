In economics, \"elasticity\" refers to the degree of responsiveness to a specific factor and \"demand elasticity\" refers to the changes in demand quantity in response to a specific factor, such as price, income, or risk. Nevertheless, it is essentially difficult to estimate the demand elasticity of medical services since both supply and demand are usually quite stable in the healthcare market. One of the common exceptions to bring about fluctuations is a natural catastrophe (such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans). Once it occurs, both supply and demand may change. During the SARS epidemic in Taiwan, in contrast, however, the supply of medical services remained steady, while the demands for medical services decreased dramatically due to public fear [2, 9, 10] . Hence, medical claim data across the SARS period should be able to serve as the correct basis to estimate the demand elasticity of various types of medical services.",

Surgeries with low demand elasticity refer to those always in a consistent service demand. In contrast, the service demand of surgeries with high demand elasticity fluctuates dramatically. Next, we used demand elasticity to categorize the various types of surgery.

Inpatient records comprise administrative information including admission month, year, admission type, and various demographic information such as age, gender, and medical costs as well as medical information such as diagnosis and procedure carried out. ICD9-CM procedure codes are used to code procedures and surgery in this database. The first two digits represent general procedures, followed by two digits that describe in more detail the specific subtype of the general procedure. For example, ICD9-CM procedure codes 47.0, 47.01 and 47.02 represent appendectomies, laparoscopic appendectomies and other appendectomies, respectively. Thus the last two codes provide detailed information about the specific surgical technique employed.

For each surgery type, we first used the monthly surgical volume from 1998 to 2001 as time series data to identify the best ARIMA model, namely the one with the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion). Then, a Q-test was performed to see if the error was autocorrelated. Next the dataset for 2002 was used as an out-of-sample dataset for model selection and evaluation, and MAPE was used to estimate the prediction power. MAPE is the average difference between observed volume and predicted volume, divided by observed volume. For all out-of-sample evaluations, the MAPE values for all models were less than 25%. The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a unit root test performed to examine whether the data were stationary. Lastly, after model evaluation, the time series data from 1998 to 2002 were used to forecast surgical volume in 2003. The observed data and expected data were plotted along with their 95% confidence intervals. The SARS epidemic in Taiwan started in March 2003 and lasted until July 2003. During this period, the needs for medical services decreased dramatically, particularly in May [10] . Therefore, we defined the MAPE value for May 2003 as an index of demand elasticity.

The surgical volumes of the selected surgery types either increased or remained steady over time, with the exception of total abdominal hysterectomy (ICD9 code 68.4X) (Fig 1) . Several studies have reported that vaginal hysterectomy is safer and has fewer complications than abdominal hysterectomy, thus, the route for carrying out hysterectomy is shifting toward the vaginal approach. In fact, the total volume for hysterectomies showed a growing trend over the study period. Table 1 shows the monthly volume and the demand elasticity of each selected surgery type. We arbitrarily classified the surgery types into three categories according to their demand elasticity indices. Indices below 30, in the range 30-190 and above 190, represented low, moderate and high demand elasticity, respectively. Appendectomy (ICD9 code 47.0X) was found to have the lowest elasticity index, followed in order by 'open reduction of fracture with internal fixation' (ICD9 code 79.3X) and 'free skin graft' (ICD9 code 86.6X) as having the next lowest In a situation where an emerging infectious disease outbreak comes into an epidemic, hospitals need to reallocate some of their staff from their normal tasks to disease control and patient care. Since ESWL and transurethral prostatectomy have the high demand elasticity, relevant staff may be the suitable target to be reallocated., The manpower serving the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained at least in a normal status. On the other hand, for surgical departments that fall into the moderate demand elasticity group, it will be necessary for institution managers to take additional factors into account before changing their manpower levels.",

In essence, surgery with low demand elasticity is almost emergent in nature, as confirmed by our study that appendectomies, open reductions of fracture and free skin grafts are all the types of surgery present in low demand elasticity group. They are also emergencies needed to be done as soon as possible. In contrast, the types of surgery with high demand elasticity are usually elective in nature--the patients may go through quite a long period of time from occurrence of indication, being informed of the need for surgery, and the final action of surgery. Transurethral prostatectomy and ESWL, which are members of the high demand elasticity group in our study, are usually elective. The most common indication for transurethral prostatectomy is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patients with BPH may have trouble with urination; for example, an urgency to urinate. Generally, the symptoms are tolerable without emergency unless there is urinary obstruction and infection. ESWL for urinary calculus is in similar case. Compared with the risk of contracting SARS, discomfort caused by BPH or urinary calculus is much less threatening. The patients would rather avoid receiving surgery during the SARS epidemic and thus decreased the demand for transurethral prostatectomy and ESWL.",

It is generally agreed that superfluous staffing should shift from the less demanding departments to the medical areas where extra manpower is urgently needed. In addition to the issue of surplus and shortage of manpower, the cost of resources repurposing should also be taken into account. As in our case, urologists are specialized for localized infection like UTI; they may not be competent enough to aid disease control. In order to help control the outbreak situation, they may need some specific training. This repurposing not only costs money but also takes time. Murphy et. al. have proposed a competency-based approach to health human resources planning. In their approach, the healthcare providers' competence is the key component for manpower reallocation regardless of the service demand of the original settings. We suggest that surgery demand elasticity can serve as another dimension to optimize the practice of manpower reallocation during an infectious outbreak.",

Therefore, if the surgery was not coded as major surgery during inpatient episodes, slight deviations from the real volumes of surgery might exist. Finally, the results from Taiwan's medical claim data may not be directly applicable to the situation in other countries.",

A low demand elasticity implies that the fear for SARS did not make any significant change in the elasticity and that the observed values for the relevant month, May 2003, fall into the expected range obtained using the ARIMA models. Fig 2A illustrates the monthly volume of appendectomies in 2003.The high demand elasticity group consisted of transurethral prostatectomy (ICD9 code 60.2X) and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ICD9 code 98.5X). A high demand elasticity means that the needs for surgery were seriously impacted during the SARS period. Specifically, the observed monthly volumes, especially in April and May 2003, dropped much lowers than the expected values.Fig 2B illustratesthe monthly volume of transurethral prostatectomies in 2003.
