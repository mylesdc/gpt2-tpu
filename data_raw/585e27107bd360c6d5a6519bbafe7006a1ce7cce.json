Although some adjuvants have been approved for commercial use in human vaccines (e.g., Alum, MF59, and AS03), they might elicit adverse side effects, such as autoimmune diseases. Recently, we developed a novel single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) nano-structure adjuvant, which can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. In this study, we evaluated the safety and toxicological profiles of this ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in vitro and in vivo. Mice were intramuscularly immunized with the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant three times, once every 2 weeks. The results indicate no significant differences in hematological and serum biochemistry parameters between the ssRNA-treated groups and the control group. From a histopathological perspective, no evidence of tissue damage was found in any group. The levels of IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies, which are markers of autoimmune disease, were not different between the ssRNA-treated groups and the control group. The findings of this study suggest that the ssRNA nano-structure can be used as a safe adjuvant to increase vaccine efficacies.",

Among them, formulating vaccines with an adjuvant typically increases vaccine efficiency. The adjuvant can recruit antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, or stabilize the vaccine. Recently, newer adjuvants have been developed to increase vaccine efficacy, especially for peptide-based vaccines [4] [5] [6] [7] . Besides, some adjuvants are under development, such as the toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, which also induces innate immune responses (a prerequisite for an effective vaccine) [4, 8] . Since the discovery of adjuvants, peptide-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and conjugated vaccines using protein antigens have been co-administered with adjuvants [6, 7] .",

Among them, alum was approved as an adjuvant for use in humans and the squalene-based adjuvants MF59 and AS03 were approved in Europe and the USA for use with influenza vaccines [6, [10] [11] [12] . However, alum mainly induces Th2-type immune responses and does not induce cell-mediated immune responses. MF59 is an excellent adjuvant for inducing antibody production against antigens, but poorly induces cell-mediated immune responses [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, the fact that these adjuvants are \"licensed\" does not mean that they are entirely safe. In case of the",

In this study, we used both sexes in compliance with the guidelines [41] . A protein-based vaccine candidate is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) protein, which was expressed in insect cells [39] . This MERS S protein was obtained from the International Vaccine Institute (Seoul, Korea). The six groups involved in this study were treated as follows: group 1 (G1), PBS-control group; group 2 (G2), 1 \u00b5g/mouse of MERS S protein; group 3 (G3), 200 \u00b5g/mouse of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant; group 4 (G4), 1 \u00b5g/mouse of MERS S protein and 20 \u00b5g/mouse of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant as the low-dose group; group 5 (G5), 1 \u00b5g/mouse of MERS S protein and 200 \u00b5g/mouse of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant as the high-dose group; group 6 (G6), 1 \u00b5g/mouse of MERS S protein and 200 \u00b5g/mouse of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant as the recovery group.

Groups 1-5 were sacrificed 1 day after the last immunization. Also, we investigated group 6 recovery for another 2 weeks after the last immunization to assess long-lasting, delayed, or reversible toxic effects according to the guideline [41] . The protein and ssRNA doses used for immunization were the same or lower than those used in previous studies [39, [42] [43] [44] .

Based on this concentration, we treated the cells with various concentrations of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant (10-200 \u00b5g/well) for 24, 48, or 72 h. The ssRNA did not affect cell viability at any concentration tested in tumor cell lines ( Figure S2A ,B) and normal human cell lines ( Figure 2 ). However, poly I:C as positive control showed some toxicity in the normal cell line ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, poly I:C induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines than those of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in RAW 264.7 cells, which are a mouse macrophage cell line ( Figure S3 , detailed in supplementary methods), indicating poly I:C may stimulate a stronger inflammation response compared to that of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant.",

Absolute liver weights of males in G6 and females in G3 and G6 were significantly higher than those of their respective control groups. Relative liver weights were significantly decreased in males of G4 but increased in females of G2 and G6 in comparison with those in the respective control groups. Absolute and relative spleen weights of males in G5 and females in G3 were significantly higher compared to those of G1. Absolute lung weights in females of G3 and G6 were higher compared to those in G1. Furthermore, relative lung weights were significantly decreased in males of G6 but increased in females of G5 in comparison with those in G1. Meanwhile, kidney weights in males of G6 and females of G2, G3, and G6 were higher than those of G1. Additionally, small and sporadic weight changes in brain, heart, and testis were found in males, and no significant weight changes in these organs were found in females. Interestingly, absolute and relative thymus weights of males in G3, G4, G5, and G6 were significantly lower compared to those of respective control groups, whereas no significant differences were found in the thymus weight among groups in females. Although these findings were regarded as toxicologically irrelevant because of the lack of remarkable histopathological correlation, further study is necessary to confirm them and to understand the mechanisms underlying the sex-related differences in thymus weight. Not only the liver, which is a typical organ studied to assess toxicity, but also the lungs, kidneys, injection sites, and immune-related organs (spleen and thymus) were stained with H + E to observe local and systemic toxicity, including cellular damage and inflammatory cell infiltration, associated with the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant (Figure 4 ). In both males and females, no significant dose-related damages in the liver and lung were apparent in the high-dose group (G5, 1 \u00b5g MERS S protein and 200 \u00b5g ssRNA adjuvant) compared with G1. Renal involvement is relatively common in autoimmune diseases [51] . In this study, we did not observe any histological changes involved in the kidney damage in both sexes. The intramuscular-injection sites were also regular in appearance. Importantly, the thymus and spleen (which serve as immunological organs) did not show any treatment-related toxicity.

Moreover, ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant showed a synergistic effect with alum to increase humoral and cellular immune responses [39] . Although alum is popularly used as an adjuvant for human clinical vaccines, it usually induces a profound Th2 response (humoral immune response) along with producing antibody, whereas it cannot stimulate Th1 response (cellular immune response) and sometimes triggers autoimmune response [4, 39] . These previous results proved that CrPV IGR IRES-derived ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant could function as an ideal vaccine adjuvant to support the weakness of alum. Nonetheless, its safety has not been well investigated yet. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to perform a comprehensive investigation for the general toxicity profile and immunological-toxicity results on the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant.",

Moreover, we also used human normal cell lines to test toxicity because of the toxin resistance of tumor cell lines. As a result, the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not elicit cellular toxicity in all tested cell lines, even with increasing ssRNA concentrations of up to 10-fold higher than we used to increase immune responses previously (20 \u00b5g/mouse) [39] . To overcome the limitation of the in vitro study, we confirmed the general toxicity and immunological toxicity of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in vivo. Our data indicate that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant formulated with the MERS S protein did not cause any treatment-related significant alteration in clinical condition, growth, or food intake. Since a broad range of toxic injuries beginning with indolent, often asymptomatic, features can progress to organ failure [60] , we additionally performed hematological and histological tests to indicate systemic adverse effects of the test materials.",

In other hematological parameters, all treatment groups showed no significant changes within physiologically normal ranges. It indicates that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not affect hematopoiesis and leukopoiesis. In addition, no dose-related significant changes were observed in all serum biochemical parameters tested. No noticeable increases in ALT and AST levels, which are representative of liver toxicity [64] , were found among the groups in both males and females. BUN and creatinine levels, which are related to renal function [65] , showed little changes in both sexes. A significant difference in a fatty liver marker TG [66] was not considered to be related to its toxicity because this observed change was within acceptable ranges [50, 67] . The changes in other markers were sporadic with no concentration-dependency, so these were not considered to reflect toxic changes due to the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant. Importantly, organ weights and histological examinations of major organs such as liver, kidney, lung, spleen, thymus, and intramuscular-injection site did not cause any toxicologically significant changes involved in treatment of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant. Collectively, in contrast to poly I:C, which causes severe damage to the kidney and spleen [24] , the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not induce any organ injury in both males and females.",

MCP-1, which is monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, recruit monocytes during infection to induce inflammation [71] . TNF-\u03b1 induces inflammation and activates lymphocytes and leukocytes [72] . IL-1\u03b2 is produced by monocytes and macrophages and plays an important role in inflammatory regulation [73] . IL-6 promotes the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, such as CRP, and is produced at the site of inflammation [74] . Overexpression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may cause excessive inflammation or autoimmune diseases [75] . In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 among groups. In particular, the levels of IL-12, which has been associated with autoimmunity [76] , were not higher in the ssRNA-treated group than in the PBS-treated group ( Figure S4E ), supporting the possibility that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not induce autoimmunity, consistent with the data on serum levels of IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies shown in Figure 5 . Interestingly, IL-10 levels of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant groups (G3 to G5) compared with G1 as a control group and G6 as a recovery group was slightly increased ( Figure 6 ). It may be counteracted to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, regardless of no significant increases at 1 day after ssRNA treatment. However, we need further study to reveal the complicated relationship between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines after treatment of ssRNA non-structure adjuvant. Taken together, not only were no significant differences found in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels among the groups, but also the IL-10 levels returned to normal levels in the recovery group. These indicate that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant had no immunological toxicity.",

In contrast, as has been observed with other adjuvants [77] , the DC frequencies of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant-treated groups were higher than those in the control in the spleen, at least partly through the association with higher neutrophil levels in the hematological analysis in vivo toxicity study ( Table 1 ). The increased DC activations found only in the G3-G5 compared with G1 as control group ( Figure 7C ) were accordance with previous data [39] , which showed that ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant transiently triggered DC activation in the injected site. This may have been caused by sacrificing the mice on the first day after the last immunization because DC activation is an early event after vaccine injection [3, 78] . The frequencies of DCs in the recovery group returned to levels found in the control group ( Figure 7C ). Since a short immune duration was observed without toxicological differences in organ weights or histopathology, it is considered that our ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not elicit immunological toxicity. Moreover, in draining lymph nodes, no significant difference occurred between groups in terms of both DCs and macrophages (data not shown).

In this study, we showed that the adjuvant did not cause weight loss or abnormal behavior in mice after immunization, even at high doses. Moreover, it did not increase any hematological and biochemical parameters and did not change the histopathological patterns compared with the control group. In addition, the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not promote sustained pro-inflammatory cytokines and excess immune cell activation for a long time, as these indicators quickly disappeared after immunization. Instead, our results appeared to reflect an effective 'hit-and-run' strategy for stimulating immune responses. Therefore, the ssRNA nano-structure can function as a safe adjuvant with high vaccine efficacy.",
