The H5N1 viruses were used as an immobilized target in a biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display random peptide library. After five rounds of panning, three phages expressing peptides HAWDPIPARDPF, AAWHLIVALAPN or ATSHLHVRLPSK had a specific binding activity to H5N1 viruses were isolated. Putative binding motifs to H5N1 viruses were identified by DNA sequencing. In terms of the minimum quantity of viruses, the phage-based ELISA was better than antiserum-based ELISA and a manual, semiquantitative endpoint RT-PCR for detecting H5N1 viruses. More importantly, the selected phages bearing the specific peptides to H5N1 viruses were capable of differentiating this virus from other avian viruses in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.",

Nonetheless, the emergence of drug resistant influenza strains raises concern over their effectiveness. It has been reported that M2 inhibitors resistant H5N1 viruses are widespread [14] . The efficacy of the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, appears to be very time dependant, where treatment started later than 24 hours post infection is much less effective [15] . Therefore other alternative antiviral drugs are required to fight H5N1 influenza. In vaccination, it is well known that influenza viruses are dynamic and are continuously evolving. Influenza type A viruses undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift, resulting in new virus strains that may not be recognized by antibodies to earlier influenza strains. Therefore, rational design of vaccines against influenza vaccines still has a long way to go. Although there are difficulties of tackling influenza virus with drugs or vaccines, they are very useful in the prevention and therapy of influenza. At the same time, effective diagnostic tests for viruses screening prior to application of drugs and vaccines are widely accepted, due to their simplicity, rapidity and applicability.",

There are reports regarding the phage-displayed peptides selected from combinatorial libraries that interacting with hepatitis B virus, adenovirus type 2, Andes virus, Sin Nombre virus and Hantaan virus and coronavirus [16] . At present, the phage display technology has become an increasingly attractive molecular tool to researchers in biotechnology related fields [17] [18] [19] . In our study, we used the H5N1 virion as an immobilized target and performed a biopanning using a 12-mer phage display peptide library. Since the viruses were harvested from the cells, therefore, we made a subtract panning by including the cell supernatant as a target to incubate with the selected phage to decrease the reaction background; in addition, we decrease the concentration of the viruses gradually to improve the specificity of the identified phages. Our results showed that the titer of the eluted phages was increased at the last round of panning (data not shown). Using ELISA, ten phage clones that specific binding to H5N1 viruses were identified. No positive results were found in the control, confirming the binding specificity of the phages to the H5N1 viruses ( Figure 1 ).",

The PCR products were approx. 250 bp in size as expected (Figure 2 ). DNA sequencing indicated that among the 10 selected phages, three deduced peptide sequences (12 amino acids in length) were identified (Table 1) . Phages bearing peptide HAWDPIPARDPF, AAWHLIVALAPN or ATSHLHVRLPSK were named phages 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The sequence data has been deposited in GenBank database and the accession numbers for phages 1-3 are JN170122, JN170123 and JN170124, respectively. Several putative motifs, such as AWxxI, RxPx or ATSHL, in the peptides were determined. The role of the identified peptides/ motifs in H5N1 virus infection needs to be investigated in the future. Recently sialylgalactose-binding peptides have been selected from a phage library to develop novel drugs that interfere with the interaction between hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus and glycoconjugate receptors on cells [20] ; Using viral hemagglutinin protein as a target and phage display technology, recombinant Fab monoclonal antibodies specific to the HA of H5N1 virus have also been characterized [8] . Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this is the first time to report the peptide sequences that can bind to the HPAI H5N1 viruses. Further experiments are needed to analyze the function of the peptides/motifs in the context of H5N1 infection.",

            "text": "The sensitivity of phage-based detection was firstly analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Figure 3 , the minimum quantity of the H5N1 viruses for phages 1 to 3 was 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. The phage 1 was the most sensitive reagent used in the phage-based ELISA. Then we used the anti-H5N1 virus serum as primary antibody to analyze the sensitivity of antibodymediated ELISA and the minimum quantity of H5N1 viruses required for the ELISA was determined as 0.3 mg (the P/N value.2) (Figure 4) . Additionally, we used RT-PCR to amplify partial HA gene of the viruses. We used 1.941 mg of H5N1 viruses to extract 40 ml of RNA. Then 5 ml of the RNA was subjected to reverse transcription. The resulting cDNA was 10-fold serially diluted and used as template for PCR. As shown in Figure 5 , under 1000-fold dilution, the PCR amplification of partial HA gene was positive and the minimum quantity of viruses for RT-PCR was calculated according to the equation: 1941 mg61/ 8610 23 = 0.243 mg. These results indicate that the phage-based ELISA is as good as if not better than antiserum-based ELISA and RT-PCR for detecting H5N1 viruses. Phages harboring specific peptides differentiated H5N1 viruses from other viruses Since another purpose of this study was to develop a novel diagnostic assay to H5N1 viruses, it is clearly important to be able to distinguish influenza A virus from other viruses that might cause mixed infections. Therefore, the selected phages were analyzed for their specificities in recognizing H5N1 viruses and other avian viruses. The avian viruses selected in this study are very common in China and some of which may cause co-infection with H5N1 viruses [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . As shown in Figure 6 , the three identified phages were capable of recognizing H5N1 viruses specifically rather than other control viruses (p,0.01). At the same time, the low reactivity of the control, the phage complex from the phage library, to the targets in the ELISA excluded any artifact clearly. To further analyze the specificity of the phage-based ELISA, we included avian H9N2 influenza viruses as coating antigen and the phagebased ELISA indicated that all the three phages recognizing H5N1 viruses had lower reaction with H9N2 viruses, compared with H5N1 ( Figure 7) (p,0.01). Testing against other strains of influenza A virus, or even of other influenza species such as B or C may be helpful for full evaluation of the diagnostic applications of the specific assay. Propagation of phage is relatively cheap and can be done on a large scale. Therefore, the specific phages identified in this study should be used as specific and inexpensive diagnostic reagents for detection of H5N1 viruses. Other diagnostic tests to H5N1 viruses such as real-time RT-PCR and genomic microarray assay have been reported recently [27, 28] . In the future, it would be interesting to use the phages to detect other H5N1 strains or other influenza A viruses to perform actual detection of virus from infected samples.",
