The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of CXCL10 to the pathogenesis of experimental septic shock in mice. Methods: Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution and, in some cases, the broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin. Studies were performed in CXCL10 knockout mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Endpoints included leukocyte trafficking and activation, core body temperature, plasma cytokine concentrations, bacterial clearance and survival. Results: CXCL10 was present at high concentrations in plasma and peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced septic shock. Survival was significantly improved in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to controls. CXCL10KO mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG showed attenuated hypothermia, lower concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) in plasma and lessened natural killer (NK) cell activation compared to control mice. Compared to control mice, bacterial burden in blood and lungs was lower in CXCL10-deficient mice but not in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 IgG plus fluids and Primaxin at 2 or 6 hours after CLP significantly improved survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG under the same conditions. Conclusions: CXCL10 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CLP-induced septic shock and could serve as a therapeutic target during the acute phase of septic shock.",

            "text": "The CXC chemokine CXCL10 (also known as interferoninducible protein 10 (IP-10)) is produced during periods of infection and inflammation in response to type I and type II interferons (IFN) such as IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3, respectively [1] [2] [3] [4] . CXCL10 activates the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR3, an important regulator of natural killer (NK), natural killer T (NKT) and T helper (Th)1 lymphocyte trafficking, in response to viral infections, autoimmune diseases, allotransplantation and cancer [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recently, a role for CXCR3 activation in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis has been proposed [11] . Compared to wild-type mice, CXCR3-deficient mice show less systemic cytokine production, attenuated physiologic dysfunction and improved survival during severe sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) [11] . Large numbers of CXCR3 + NK cells migrate from the spleen and blood into the peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced sepsis, a phenomenon that is ablated in CXCR3-deficient mice as well as in mice treated with neutralizing antibodies against CXCR3 [11, 12] . Thus, the trafficking of NK cells to the site of infection after CLP parallels the development of systemic inflammation and mortality. Both phenomena are ablated by CXCR3 deficiency or blockade, which raises the contention that the improved outcomes observed in septic mice with CXCR3 deficiency or blockade are due to attenuated trafficking and activation of innate lymphocyte populations. However, further research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which CXCR3 activation facilitates the pathogenesis of septic shock.",

In clinical studies, plasma CXCL10 concentrations are markedly elevated in septic patients and plasma CXCL10 concentrations correlate with the severity of sepsis in humans [4, 13, 14] . Punyadeera et al. [14] reported that elevated plasma CXCL10 concentrations are predictive of the transition from sepsis to septic shock in critically ill adults.

When the urea concentrations in plasma and a peritoneal lavage sample are known, the dilution of the initial volume of peritoneal fluid obtained can be calculated as previously described [18, 19] . The urea content of peritoneal lavage and plasma samples were determined using iStat Chem8 cartridges (Abbott Point of Care, Princeton, NJ, USA). CXCL10, IL-6 and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) concentrations were measured using ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocols (eBioscience). Cytokine concentrations were determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA, USA). Previous studies from our laboratory, and others, show that the magnitude of systemic IL-6 and MIP-2 production during CLP-induced sepsis parallels the severity of physiologic dysfunction and mortality [11, 20] .

Studies were undertaken to assess rectal temperature in wild-type and CXCL10KO mice during CLP-induced sepsis. In mice that did not receive Primaxin, temperature was measured at 12 hours after CLP, whereas temperature was measured at 24 hours after CLP in mice that received primaxin as part of the resuscitation protocol ( Figure 3 ). Those time points were chosen due to the effect of antibiotic treatment on time to initial mortality as shown in Figure 2 . Specifically, initial mortality was observed by 12 hours in mice that did not receive antibiotics, whereas antibiotic treatment prolonged initial mortality until 24 hours after CLP. Thus, measurements were made at the time on mortality onset in the respective groups. In mice that did not receive primaxin treatment, rectal temperature was significantly decreased in wildtype, but not CXCL10KO, mice compared to non-septic controls. Rectal temperature was significantly higher in CXCL10KO mice compared to wild-type mice ( Figure 3 ). Wild-type and CXCL10KO mice treated with Primaxin exhibited significantly decreased rectal temperature at 24 hours after CLP compared to non-septic controls. Rectal temperature was significantly higher in CXCL10KO mice compared to wild-type mice ( Figure 3 ).

Rectal temperature and plasma IL-6 and Macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) concentrations were measured in mice treated with or without primaxin after CLP: n = 10 mice per group; *P <0.05 compared to control, + P <0.05 compared to wild-type mice. WT, wild-type. Measurements were made at the onset of mortality in our model: at 24 hours post-CLP in mice that received primaxin and 12 hours post-CLP in mice that did not receive antibiotics. In further studies, rectal temperature and plasma IL-6 and MIP-2 concentrations were measured in wild-type mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG or non-specific IgG (Figure 8 ). Mice were resuscitated with LR plus primaxin. CLP induced a significant decrease in temperature in wild-type mice treated with non-specific IgG compared to non-septic controls. Rectal temperature was not significantly decreased in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to non-septic controls and was significantly higher than in mice treated with non-specific IgG ( Figure 8 ). Examination of plasma cytokines showed that IL-6 and MIP-2 concentrations were significantly lower in the anti-CXCL10 IgG group compared to the non-specific IgG group (Figure 8) .",

Rectal temperature was measured at the indicated time points and showed a significant decline at 4 hours after CLP and a further decline at 6 hours after CLP compared to non-septic (0 hours) mice ( Figure 10 ). Assessment of acid-base balance at 6 hours after CLP showed metabolic acidosis compared to sham mice, characterized by a significant decrease in blood pH and bicarbonate concentrations ( Figure 10 ). P a CO 2 was also significantly lower in septic mice compared to sham controls, reflecting respiratory compensation for the emerging metabolic acidosis ( Figure 10 ).

Sepsis-induced hypothermia and systemic cytokine production were attenuated and survival rates were higher in CXCL10-deficient mice and in mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against CXCL10, compared to control mice. Collectively, those observations support the contention that CXCL10 plays a functional role in facilitating inflammation and physiology during CLP-induced acute septic shock. In addition, CXCL10 blockade could serve as a therapeutic target during acute septic shock, as treatment with anti-CXCL10 IgG and antibiotics was effective in improving survival when administered at 2 or 6 hours after the onset of sepsis. The improvement in survival observed when mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG at 6 hours after CLP was particularly compelling because mice showed clinical signs of sepsis such as hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, systemic inflammation and bacteremia at the time of treatment.",

Several studies have reported increased concentrations of CXCL10 in the plasma of septic human adults, infants and neonates [4, 13, 15, 16] . Punyadeera and colleagues showed that high plasma CXCL10 concentrations are associated with the transition from sepsis to septic shock in critically ill adult patients [14] . Elevated plasma CXCL10 concentrations have also been shown to be a reliable indicator of sepsis in neonates and infants [15, 16] . However, the functional importance of CXCL10 in facilitating the pathogenesis of severe bacterial sepsis had not been directly examined. Yet, prior studies have shown that CXCL10 contributes to acute organ injury and physiologic dysfunction in other acute inflammatory syndromes. Ichikawa and colleagues showed that mice lacking CXCL10 are resistant to acute lung injury caused by acid aspiration or influenza virus infection [22] . CXCL10 neutralization has been effective in attenuating NK and CD8 T cell-mediated hepatocellular injury during fulminant Dengue virus infection [23] . A role for CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria has also been described (See figure on previous page.)

In further studies, Martin and colleagues showed that virulent strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA) induced high concentrations CXCL10 in the lung after intrapulmonary challenge and that CXCR3 neutralization decreases intrapulmonary inflammation [27] . The present studies show that CXCL10-deficient mice are resistant to CLP-induced septic shock and more directly support a cause-and-effect relationship between CXCL10 and the pathogenesis of sepsis. The production of CXCL10 is largely regulated by activation of type I and type II IFN receptors by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3, respectively [28, 29] . The transcription factor STAT-1 is an important mediator for IFN-induced gene transcription and plays a central role in regulating CXCL10 expression [29] [30] [31] . Previous studies from our laboratory show that STAT1-deficient mice are resistant to CLPinduced septic shock [32] . STAT1 knockout mice exhibited improved survival, attenuated systemic inflammation and diminished CXCL10 production during CLP-induced sepsis. In additional studies, decreased systemic inflammation and improved survival have been demonstrated in type 1 IFN receptor-and IFN\u03b2-deficient mice during fulminant CLP-induced peritonitis and endotoxin-induced shock, respectively [33] [34] [35] . Dejager et al. reported that blockade of type I IFN signaling was protective in models of endotoxin and CLP-induced severe sepsis [35] . In other studies, Lachance and colleagues showed that IFN\u03b3deficient mice are resistant to septic shock caused by a virulent strain of Streptococcus suis [36] . That finding is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated attenuated hyperinflammation and improved survival in IFN\u03b3-deficient mice in models of CLP-and endotoxininduced shock [37, 38] . Taken together, those prior findings and the results from the present study support a role of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN\u03b3 and CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of septic shock.",

Kelly-Scumpia and colleagues reported that type I IFN receptor-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to lower severity CLP-induced sepsis in which control mice showed mortality rates of less than 10% [39] . The heightened susceptibility was associated with impaired bacterial clearance. They further reported that the vulnerability can be reversed by treatment with CXCL10 and concluded that CXCL10 is an important regulator of antimicrobial function during low-severity CLP-induced sepsis in adult mice. Reim et al. also reported that IFN-inducible responses, including production of CXCL10, are beneficial for facilitating bacterial clearance mechanisms in a lower-severity model of CLP-induced sepsis [40] . In further studies, Cuenca et al. showed that CXCL10 is important for neutrophil and macrophage recruitment during neonatal sepsis [41] . In those studies, blockade of CXCL10 decreased myeloid cell recruitment to the site of infection, decreased bacterial clearance and increased mortality. Likewise, neonatal CXCR3KO mice showed decreased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages at the site of infection and increased mortality compared to wild-type controls. The investigators postulated that CXCL10 regulates beneficial myeloid cell recruitment during bacterial sepsis in neonatal mice. Interestingly, significantly decreased bacterial counts were observed in the blood and lungs, but not peritoneal cavity, of CXCL10 knockout mice in our study. However, differences in bacterial burden were not observed at any of the sites tested in mice treated with anti-CXCL10. Those findings indicate that CXCL10 could have a small inhibitory effect on bacterial clearance during severe sepsis. In toto, these combined findings indicate that CXCL10 production can be beneficial or deleterious depending on the severity of sepsis.",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which CXCL10 facilitates systemic inflammation and physiologic dysfunction during severe sepsis remain to be fully ascertained. CXCL10 activates the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and is an important regulator of lymphocyte trafficking in a variety of diseases characterized by infection or inflammation [1, 2, 11] . CXCR3 is expressed primarily by NK, NKT and T lymphocytes, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock [1] . Previous studies from our laboratory and from others have demonstrated that NK and CD8 + T cells contribute to systemic inflammation and physiologic dysfunction during sepsis or polytrauma [17, [42] [43] [44] . Hu and colleagues reported that NKT cells play a functional role in the pathogenesis of CLP-induced septic shock (See figure on previous page.) Figure 5 Natural killer cell trafficking during cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in wild-type and CXC chemokine 10 (CXCL10)-deficient mice. Splenocytes and intraperitoneal leukocytes were harvested prior to or 6 hours after CLP. Natural killer (NK) cells were identified using flow cytometry as NK1.1 + CD3 \u2212 lymphocytes and were further characterized based on CD11b and CD27 expression. DN, double negative NK cells, I = CD27 + CD11b \u2212 immature NK cells, II = CD27 + CD11b + pro-inflammatory NK cells, III = CD27 \u2212 CD11b + cytotoxic NK cells; n = 5 to 11 mice per group. *P <0.05 compared to \"Before CLP\". while other investigators have shown that NKT cells facilitate systemic inflammation during lethal challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [45, 46] . Evidence indicates that CXCR3 + NK cells migrate into the inflamed peritoneal cavity from blood and spleen early during the course of CLP-induced sepsis. In addition, CXCR3-mediated NK cell trafficking parallels the development of physiologic dysfunction and systemic inflammation during experimental septic shock [11, 17] . In the present study, we observed trafficking of NK cells from spleen to peritoneal cavity within 6 hours after CLP and extended our previous findings by showing the migration of both the CD27 + CD11b + pro-inflammatory and CD27 \u2212 CD11b + cytotoxic NK cell subsets. Yet, differences in NK cell trafficking were not observed when comparing wildtype and CXCL10-deficient mice. That finding indicates that CXCL10 alone is not responsible for NK cell trafficking during CLP-induced sepsis, which is not surprising, given the redundancy of CXCR3 ligands [1] .",

Thus, it is likely that CXCL9 also contributes to CXCR3-mediated NK cell trafficking and serves as an important NK cell chemoattractant in the absence of CXCL10. Further studies are required to fully define the chemokine milieu that mediates NK cell trafficking during sepsis. Although CXCL10-mediated NK cell trafficking does not appear to be a crucial factor in facilitating the development of shock in the CLP model, CXCL10-induced NK cell activation may play a role. NK cell activation and systemic inflammation were attenuated in CXCL10deficient mice as indicated by lessened expression of the early activation marker CD69 by intraperitoneal NK cells and decreased systemic cytokine production. This raises the possibility that CXCL10 serves as an activating factor for NK cells, independent of its role as a chemotactic agent. Previous studies have shown that CXCL10 can facilitate systemic inflammation during acute inflammatory syndromes [22, 47] . However, further work is needed to determine how CXCL10 facilitates the proinflammatory functions of innate lymphocytes during severe sepsis.",

In the present study, blockade of CXCL10, in combination with antibiotic treatment at 6 hours after CLP was effective in improving survival compared to mice treated with nonspecific IgG and antibiotics. Our assessment indicates that mice show signs of sepsis at 6 hours after CLP as indicated by the presence of hypothermia, metabolic acidosis and bacteremia. Further work is needed to fully define the potential application of CXCL10 blockade as a therapeutic agent during the acute phase of septic shock. Treatment with IgG molecules, as used in this study, is an attractive approach to altering host immune responses in numerous diseases with immunological or inflammatory etiologies [48, 49] . Based on our current observations, immunoglobulin-based strategies appear to represent an attractive strategy for blocking CXCL10 in the setting of severe sepsis. However, there are potential drawbacks to immunoglobulin-based treatment approaches, the most important of which is the persistence of immunoglobulins in the circulation after systemic administration. Long-lived blockade of CXCL10 function could be deleterious to mounting effective downstream anti-microbial responses in patients with sepsis as demonstrated by the studies of Kelly-Scumpia and colleagues [39] . An alternative approach is the use of short-acting small molecular weight inhibitors to block CXCL10 or its receptor, CXCR3. AMG487 is a potent and selective noncompetitive CXCR3 inhibitor that has been widely tested in humans [50] . AMG487 undergoes hepatic metabolism and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics during the first 7 days of administration with a half-life of 9.7 hours [51] . Thus, short-acting inhibitors of the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could serve as attractive agents to apply during the acute phase of sepsis.",

Our current findings suggest that CXCL10 may contribute to the activation of innate lymphocyte populations, particularly NK cells, during acute septic shock. Further research is needed to fully define the mechanisms by which CXCL10 facilitates the pathogenesis of septic shock and to define the potential of CXCL10 blockade as a therapeutic intervention.",
