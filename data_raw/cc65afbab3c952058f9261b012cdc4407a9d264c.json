The SFTSV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, facilitate viral entry into host cells. Gn and Gc are generated from a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, but it is currently unknown how the precursor is converted into the single proteins and whether this process is required for viral infectivity. Employing a rhabdoviral pseudotyping system, we demonstrate that a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is required for Gn/Gc processing and viral infectivity while potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites in Gc are dispensable. Moreover, we show that expression of Gn or Gc alone is not sufficient for host cell entry while particles bearing both proteins are infectious, and we provide evidence that Gn facilitates Golgi transport and virion incorporation of Gc. Collectively, these results suggest that signal peptidase liberates mature Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor and that this process is essential for viral infectivity and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention.",

Several emerging bunyaviruses pose a considerable threat to human health as exemplified by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [1] , Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) [2] and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) [3, 4] , which can cause severe disease in afflicted patients. SFTSV, a novel member of the phlebovirus genus, emerged in 2007 in Central and Eastern China [5, 6] . The virus is transmitted from ticks to humans, with human to human transmission occurring on rare instances [7] [8] [9] , and can induce a severe disease characterized by fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and thrombocytopenia. The case-fatality rate is approximately 10% in China, with the elderly being disproportionately affected, but higher rates have been observed upon SFTSV outbreaks in South Korea [10] and Japan [11] . Moreover, a virus closely related to SFTSV, Heartland virus, has been identified in the US and infection was associated with severe disease [12] . Thus, SFTSV and related viruses are important emerging agents against which at present neither specific antivirals nor vaccines are available.",

The M segment encodes for the viral envelope proteins Gn and Gc, which facilitate viral entry into target cells and are the major targets for neutralizing antibodies [13, 14] . In addition, the M segments of some bunyaviruses encode a non-structural protein (NSm) but no NSm open reading frame was identified in the M segment of SFTSV. The Gn and Gc proteins of SFTSV have been shown to mediate entry into several cell lines as well as primary dendritic cells and macrophages [15, 16] . Entry into dendritic cells depends on the cellular lectin DC-SIGN [15] , which can interact with pathogens in a glycan-dependent manner. Moreover, Gn binds to non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA and expression of this protein is required for efficient SFTSV infection of cell lines [17] . Thus, SFTSV employs the Gn and Gc proteins as keys for entry into target cells and elucidating the processing and function of these proteins might reveal targets for antiviral intervention.",

The SFTSV-Gn/Gc-V5 sequence inserted into plasmid pCAGGS served as basis for the generation of further constructs. Expression plasmids for SFTSV-Gn (aa 1-543) and SFTSV-Gc (aa 536-1073) with and without C-terminal V5-or myc-tag were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning of PCR products into plasmid pCAGGS using Asp718 and XhoI restriction sites.

The PCR product was inserted into plasmid pCAGGS using Asp718 and MluI restriction sites, resulting in mutant mutATG-Gc. To mutate RRxR motifs within Gc, overlap extension PCR was employed.

The PCR product encoding mutRRxR-2 was directly inserted into pCAGGS using MluI and XhoI restriction sites. In contrast, the PCR products encoding mutRRxR-1 and mutATG-Gc-RRxR-1 were first inserted into pcDNA3.1zeo containing a partial SFTSV fragment followed by insertion of the entire coding sequence into pCAGGS via Asp718 and XhoI restriction sites. The PCR and cloning strategy used for generation of mutants mutRRxR-1 and mutATG-Gc-RRxR-1 was also employed to generate mutants \u0394SigP-V5 (\u0394536-560) and \u0394LAIGLAEG-V5 (\u0394555-562). Specifically, primers 5'-GGCAACCAGGAC GACGTGCGGATCGAG GGCTGTGACGAAATGGTGCACGCCGAC-3' and 5'-GTCGGCGTG CACCATTTCGTCACAGCCCTCGATCCGCACGTCGTCCTGGTTGCC-3' were used as inner primers to generate SFTSV\u0394SigP-V5 (\u0394536-560) while inner primers 5'-CCAGTGATCCT GACCATCTGTGACGAAATGGTGCAC-3' and 5'-GTGCACCATTTCGTCACAGATGGTCAG GATCACTGG-3' were employed for constructing SFTSV\u0394LAIGLAEG-V5 (\u0394555-562). The integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was confirmed by in house (German Primate Center) automated sequence analysis (Sanger method). Plasmids pE-GFP-ER, which encodes calreticulin fused to GFP [27], and pE-GFP-Golgi, which encodes beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase fused to GFP [28], were used to visualize the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, respectively.",

These results indicate that SFTSV-Gn/Gc and other bunyavirus Gn/Gc precursor proteins were efficiently processed into mature proteins under the conditions studied. We next asked whether Gn and Gc proteins can be expressed separately and whether expression of both proteins is required for host cell entry. Mature Gn and Gc are predicted to exhibit almost identical molecular weights of 60 kDa and 58 kDa, respectively, and the corresponding bands were indeed detected in cells transfected with separate expression plasmids encoding these proteins (Fig 1B) . For at present unclear reasons, expression of Gc from a plasmid encoding only the Gc ORF was more efficient than expression from a Gn/Gc encoding plasmid, and Gn was expressed to higher levels than Gc (Fig 1B) . Digestion with PNGase F revealed that Gn and Gc expressed from separate plasmids were N-glycosylated (Gn harbors two consensus sequences for N-glycosylation while three consensus sequences are present in Gc), indicating that these proteins enter the secretory pathway (Fig 1C) , as expected.",

In contrast, expression of Gn alone was not sufficient to render particles infectious, despite efficient particle incorporation of the protein (Fig 2A and 2B) . Moreover, particles produced in the presence of Gc did not harbor Gc and were not infectious. Finally, particles produced in cells cotransfected with separate Gn and Gc plasmids were able to transduce cells, although with slightly reduced efficiency as compared to particles from Gn/Gc expressing cells (Fig 2A and 2B) .

Moreover, mutation of either of two RRxR motifs reduced virion incorporation (Fig 4C) of Gc and particle infectivity (Fig 4D) . In contrast, mutation of the ATG did not interfere with expression and virion incorporation of Gc or with particle infectivity (Fig 4C and 4D) . These results suggest that the RRxR motifs in Gc do not constitute cleavage sites for proprotein convertases or other cellular proteases. Indeed, blockade of proprotein convertases inhibited processing of the LASV-GPC and EBOV-GP (Fig 5A and 5B) , as expected [31,32], but had no impact on processing of SFTSV-Gn/Gc (Fig 5C) . Similarly, blockade of a serine protease activity previously shown to be required in target cells for efficient Gn/Gc-driven entry [15] was dispensable for Gn/Gc processing (Fig 5) . Collectively, our observations indicate that Gn/Gc processing is independent of proprotein convertase activity and RRxR motifs in Gc. Moreover, they suggest that the ATG of the Gc ORF does not serve as a start codon for translation in the context of the Gn/Gc mRNA.",

Such considerations were supported by the well-established role of the proprotein convertase SKI-1 in the generation of Gn of CCHFV [22, 23] . However, neither mutation of the RRxR motifs in the context of Gn/Gc nor inhibition of proprotein convertase activity reduced processing of Gn/Gc. Transduction efficiency was diminished upon mutation of the RRxR motifs but this effect was likely due to reduced virion incorporation of the Gc mutants. These results argue against a role of proprotein convertases in the generation of mature Gc. The impact of the methionine at position 1 of Gc on generation of Gc from Gn/Gc encoding mRNA was also examined. A role for the methionine in Gc expression would have been expected if Gn and Gc were separate translation products, with the first codon of Gc serving as a start codon. Such a scenario would apply, for instance, in case of an undetected IRES element in the Gn/Gc mRNA. However, mutation of the Gc methionine did not interfere with production of Gc from mRNA encoding Gn/Gc. These results indicate that proprotein convertase activity, RRxR motifs within Gc as well as the Gc methionine are dispensable for generation of mature Gc from its precursor, Gn/Gc. We next asked whether signal peptidase might liberate Gc from Gn/Gc. This question was instigated by sequence analysis, which predicted the presence of a signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc. Notably, the four amino acid residues preceding the predicted cleavage site in SFTSV-Gc (positions -4 to -1) as well as the amino acid residue at position +1 were found to resolution and cropped to 70% of the original image for presentation purposes. No further image modifications were performed. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment.",

            "text": "The availability of SFTSV-Gn/Gc mutants allowed us to investigate whether Gn/Gc processing is required for infectivity. Unprocessed Gn/Gc was incorporated into particles but failed to facilitate transduction of target cells, demonstrating that unprocessed SFTSV-Gn/Gc is inactive. This finding is in line with the observation that expression of Gn or Gc alone in particle producing cells was not sufficient for particle infectivity, while particles generated in the presence of both proteins were infectious. This finding raised the question how Gn and Gc contributed to particle infectivity. Based on in silico analyses and the X-ray structure of the Rift valley fever virus Gc, bunyavirus Gc proteins were identified as class II membrane fusion proteins. [40] . Therefore, a requirement for SFTSV-Gc for particle infectivity was expected while the contribution of SFTSV-Gn was less clear. The observation that Gn expression was required for particle incorporation of Gc suggested that Gn might function as a chaperon, which facilitates appropriate trafficking of Gc. Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Gc was mainly localized in the ER when expressed alone while coexpression of Gn resulted in accumulation of Gc in the Golgi apparatus, the site of bunyavirus assembly and budding. These observations are in keeping with previous studies, which ascribed a chaperon function to the Gn protein of Bunyamwera and Uukuniemi virus [41-43]. One can speculate that a hydrophobic domain in the SFTSV-Gn cytoplasmic tail is responsible for the Golgi localization of the protein, since such a domain is also present in the Gn proteins of other phleboviruses and is known to serve as a Golgi retention signal [44] [45] [46] . Moreover, it is conceivable that the long cytoplasmic tail of SFTSV-Gn masks a lysine at position -3 in the cytoplasmic tail of SFTSV-Gc, which is conserved between diverse bunyaviruses and is required for ER localization [46] . The chaperon activity of Gn might depend on Gn-Gc interactions formed with high efficiency only after proteolytic separation of these proteins from the Gn/Gc precursor during glycoprotein biogenesis. Such a scenario might explain why particles generated in Gn/Gc expressing cells incorporated more Gc and were more infectious than their counterparts produced in cells transfected with separate Gn and Gc expression plasmids, despite increased Gn indicated.

The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and relative quantification of signal intensities was performed.

(D) Western blot analysis of the pseudotypes analyzed in panel C employing V5-specific antibody (top) or a VSV M-specific antibody (bottom). Unprocessed glycoprotein precursor proteins are marked with filled triangles while asterisks indicate processing products. expression and particle incorporation under the latter conditions. However, the role of Gn in SFTSV infection might not be limited to that of a chaperon, since a previous study reported that SFTSV-Gn binds to susceptible cells and interacts with the entry factor non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA [17] . It is therefore conceivable that SFTSV-Gn facilitates trafficking and maybe folding of Gc and binds to entry factors while Gc drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes, a possibility supported by the recent findings that the Gc proteins of RVFV and SFTSV possess a class II membrane fusion protein architecture [47, 48] .",
