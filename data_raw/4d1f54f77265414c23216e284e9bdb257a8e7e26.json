            "text": "Bats are reservoirs for many RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans yet relatively apathogenic in the natural host. It has been suggested that differences in innate immunity are responsible. The antiviral OAS-RNase L pathway is well characterized in humans, but there is little known about its activation and antiviral activity in bats. During infection, OASs, upon sensing doublestranded RNA (dsRNA), produce 2=-5= oligoadenylates (2-5A), leading to activation of RNase L which degrades viral and host RNA, limiting viral replication. Humans encode three active OASs (OAS1 to -3). Analysis of the Egyptian Rousette bat genome combined with mRNA sequencing from bat RoNi/7 cells revealed three homologous OAS proteins. Interferon alpha treatment or viral infection induced all three OAS mRNAs, but RNase L mRNA is constitutively expressed. Sindbis virus (SINV) or vaccinia virus (VACV\u0394E3L) infection of wild-type (WT) or OAS1-KO (knockout), OAS2-KO, or MAVS-KO RoNi/7 cells, but not RNase L-KO or OAS3-KO cells, induces robust RNase L activation. SINV replication is 100to 200-fold higher in the absence of RNase L or OAS3 than in WT cells. However, MAVS-KO had no detectable effect on RNA degradation or replication. Thus, in RoNi/7 bat cells, as in human cells, activation of RNase L during infection and its antiviral activity are dependent primarily on OAS3 while MAVS signaling is not required for the activation of RNase L and restriction of infection. Our findings indicate that OAS proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize viral dsRNA and that this pathway is a primary response to virus rather than a secondary effect of interferon signaling. IMPORTANCE Many RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans are relatively apathogenic in their bat reservoirs, making it important to compare innate immune responses in bats to those well characterized in humans. One such antiviral response is the OAS-RNase L pathway. OASs, upon sensing dsRNA, produce 2-5A, leading to activation of RNase L which degrades viral and host RNA, limiting viral replication. Analysis of Egyptian Rousette bat sequences revealed three OAS genes expressing OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 proteins. Interferon treatment or viral infection induces all three bat OAS mRNAs. In these bat cells as in human cells, RNase L activation and its antiviral activity are dependent primarily on OAS3 while MAVS signaling is not required. Importantly, our findings indicate the OAS-RNase L system is a primary response to virus rather than a secondary effect of interferon signaling and therefore can be activated early in infection or while interferon signaling is antagonized. FIG 1 Interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the Egyptian Rousette (ER) Oas1, Oas2, and Oas3 genes. Bat OAS ISRE sequences were compared to those in human (H) OAS genes. The numbers indicate the positions of the ISREs relative to each ATG initiation codon (\u03e91). The gene sequences were derived from GenBank: bOas1 (ID 107513273), bOas3-like (ID 107513228) for both Oas2 and Oas3 ISREs, hOAS1 (ID 4938), hOAS2 (ID 4939), and hOAS3 (ID 4940).",

These include filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) (1) (2) (3) (4) , coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) (5, 6) , alphaviruses (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [VEEV]) (7) , and Nipah/Hendra viruses (8) . Several studies have suggested that bats can tolerate infection due to an enhanced innate immune response that enables early control of infection and prevents systemic dissemination (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . For example, three alpha interferon (IFN-\u2423) genes are constitutively expressed in black flying fox, Pteropus alecto (12) . Other studies report that bats have a dampened host response, speculated to promote virus-host coexistence (15, 16) . For example, the cGAS-STING pathway is dampened in some bats species due to a mutation in STING (15) and the inflammasome DNA sensor AIM2 is missing from almost all the known bat species (17) . Thus, there is a need for further investigation into the innate immune response in bats and how it impacts viral infection.",

We screened a group of bat cells (discussed further below) for activation of RNase L during Sindbis virus (SINV) infection and chose to carry out further studies in Egyptian Rousette (ER) bat (Egyptian fruit bat)-derived RoNi/7 cells. Through bioinformatic analysis of the annotated genomic sequence of Egyptian Rousette bats from GenBank (28), we identified three OAS genes (bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3) and two OASL genes (bOASL1 and bOASL2). (We designate bat genes or proteins as bOAS to differentiate them from human [h] or mouse [m] genes or proteins.) We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to generate bOAS-KO Egyptian Rousette-derived RoNi/7 cells (29) . We found that, as in human cells, the activation of RNase L is dependent on bOAS3 expression during infection with SINV. In addition, KO of bOAS3 or RNASEL leads to greater than 100-fold more SINV replication, while KO of either bOAS1 or bOAS2 promotes more modest increases in replication. As in human cells, activation of RNase L by SINV is independent of MAVS expression in bat RoNi/7 cells, suggesting that RNase L may be activated either before or without virus-induced IFN. Similar results were obtained with vaccinia virus, VACV\u0394E3L, in bat RoNi/7 cells. Finally, our data indicate that the OAS-RNase L pathway has a greater antiviral effect than MAVS-dependent IFN signaling in RoNi cells as well as human cells.",

Using the genomic sequences of Egyptian Rousette bat from GenBank, we analyzed the genes and protein sequences of bat OASs, OASLs, and RNase L (28) . The genes were annotated as OAS1 (GenBank ID 107513273), OAS3-like (GenBank ID 107513228), OASL (GenBank ID 107513228), and OASL2 (GenBank ID 107501264). No OAS2 was noted. The Egyptian Rousette (ER) bOAS1 gene encodes a protein that shares 67% and 59% amino acid sequence similarity to human OAS1 and mouse Oas1, respectively ( Table 1) . The annotated ER OAS3-like gene encodes a protein of 1,903 amino acids. Amino acids 1 to 1082 share 80% similarity with human OAS3 (1,083 amino acids), and amino acids 1197 to 1903 share 71% similarity with human OAS2 (709 amino acids). These results suggested that the annotated ER OAS3-like gene encoded an OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein. Since in most known species, OAS2 and OAS3 are two separate genes, we could not exclude the possibility that ER OAS3 and OAS2 genes were falsely annotated as one gene. To clarify this question, we attempted to clone the mRNA encoded by the bOAS1 and bOAS3-like genes. We cloned the bOAS1 open reading frame (ORF) successfully, but we could not clone the mRNA predicted to encode a bOAS3-bOAS2 fusion protein. Instead, we cloned two cDNAs which encode bOAS2 and bOAS3 open reading frames separately. These results suggested that ER bats and humans share similar OAS gene structures (Fig. 1 ).

To determine whether ER Oas genes are ISGs, we analyzed the genomic sequences for ISREs (A/GNGAAANNGAAACT or AGTTTCNNTTTCNC/T) (30) . We found that the ER Oas1 gene promoter region contains one ISRE with high sequence identity with that of human OAS1 (Fig. 1) . Upstream of the bOAS2 coding region, we found two adjacent ISREs in the opposite polarity, the first with homology to the one ISRE found in the human OAS2 gene. The ISRE of ER bOAS3 is identical to the first one of two found in the human OAS3 gene. We did not find an ISRE in the promoter region of the ER RNase L gene. bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3 mRNAs are induced by IFN-\u2423 or infection with SINV or SeV in RoNi/7 cells. RoNi/7 cells were treated with human universal IFN-\u2423, the relative mRNA levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and the fold increase in expression over mock-treated cells was calculated. Induction of bat IFIT1 (ISG56) mRNA was used as a positive control (14) and was increased by 81-fold upon IFN-\u2423 treatment ( Fig. 2A ). All three bOAS mRNAs were induced by IFN-\u2423; the bOAS1 mRNA level increased by 48-fold, while the mRNA level of bOAS2 and bOAS3 increased by 22-and 11-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A) , consistent with the ISREs in their promoters. The mRNA level of RNase L did not change upon IFN treatment in RoNi/7 cells, indicating that, similarly to the human RNASEL gene, bat RNASEL is not an ISG ( Fig. 2A) , consistent with the lack of an ISRE in its promoter region (data not shown). To investigate induction of bOAS genes during viral infection, RoNi/7 cells were infected with SINV or Sendai virus (SeV). While the relative mRNA level of bOAS1 increased by 70-to 80-fold during SINV or SeV infection, bOAS2 mRNA was only weakly (4-to 6-fold) induced and bOAS3 mRNA was induced somewhat more (15-or 9-fold) during SINV or SeV infection, respectively ( Fig. 2B and C), similar to induction by IFN-\u2423 ( Fig. 2A to C) .",

Thus, we deployed the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 geneediting technology to KO expression of bOAS1, bOAS2, bOAS3, and bRNase L, each separately, from RoNi/7 cells. The KOs of bOAS2 and bOAS3 were confirmed by Western blotting, while the disruptions of the OAS1 and RNase L genes for which we lacked antibodies were confirmed by sequencing of the CRISPR-induced insertion (bOAS1) or deletion (RNase L) ( Fig. 6A and B ). Upon infection with SINV, degradation of rRNA, as assessed by Bioanalyzer, was detected in wild-type (WT) and bOAS1-KO and bOAS2-KO cells but not in bOAS3-KO and bRNase L-KO cells (Fig. 6C) , indicating that the activation of RNase L during SINV infection in RoNi/7 cells is dependent on bOAS3 expression, similar to our previous findings in human cells. We assessed viral replication in this set of KO cells at several time points postinfection. At 24 and 36 h postinfection (hpi), both bRNase L-KO and bOAS3-KO cells showed approximately 100-to 200-fold higher titers than the parental WT cells (Fig. 6D ). Viral titers from bOAS1-KO and bOAS2-KO cells were more modestly elevated than in WT cells at 24 and 36 h postinfection, 3-to 8-fold for bOAS1-KO and 12-to 15-fold for bOAS2-KO (Fig. 6D ). When the second bOAS2-KO and Activation of Bat RNase L Depends on OAS3 but Not MAVS \u00ae bOAS3-KO clones were infected with SINV, similar data were obtained for activation of RNase L by Bioanalyzer assay (Fig. S3A ) and for virus replication ( Fig. S3B and C) . The second bOAS2-KO clone examined displayed lower levels of virus replication than the clone originally used, closer to levels observed in WT cells (Fig. 6 ), but neither clone showed increased RNase L activation as assessed by Bioanalyzer, compared to WT cells (Fig. S3 ). It is important to note that while bOAS1 and bOAS2 mRNA and protein expression levels are upregulated during SINV infection ( Fig. 2A and Fig. 6E ), this is not sufficient to activate RNase L in the absence of bOAS3 expression (Fig. 6C) .",

Thus, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate bMAVS-KO RoNi/7 cells. The KO was validated by sequencing (Fig. 8A ) in the RoNi/7 Mavs gene. (Fig. 8B) , consistent with RNase L activation. While SINV replicated to more than 100-fold-higher titers in bRNase L-KO cells than in the parental WT cells (Fig. 6D and Fig. 8C ), replication in bMAVS-KO cells did not show significant differences at 24 h postinfection and showed a slightly higher titer (3-fold) at 36 h postinfection (Fig. 8C) . Similar data were obtained for activation of RNase L by rRNA degradation assay by Bioanalyzer (Fig. S4A) and for virus replication when a second bMAVS-KO clone was infected with SINV (Fig. S4B) . While as expected KO of MAVS from RoNi/7 cells reduced bOAS2 and bOAS3 induction during SINV infection (Fig. 8D) , there was no effect on the activation of RNase L. Similar results were observed when we used human A549 cells. During SINV infection, rRNA degradation was observed in MAVS-KO A549 cells (Fig. 8E ). In addition, no significant titer differences were observed at 24 or 36 h postinfection in MAVS-KO A549 cells, while RNase L-KO cells showed 6-fold-higher titers than WT cells (Fig. 8F) at 24 h postinfection.

In addition, cells were lysed at 42 h postinfection for determination of viral replication by plaque assays.

When we analyzed the annotated Egyptian Rousette genomic sequences in GenBank, we noted three genes, bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3, homologous to human OAS genes, each with one or two ISREs in their promoter regions indicative of ISGs. We cloned and sequenced the open reading frames (ORFs) from the mRNAs encoding bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3. Our findings are in contrast to the annotated Egyptian Rousette genomic sequences, which indicate two bOAS genes, bOAS1, which is predicted to encode bOAS1, a homologue of human OAS1, and a bOAS3-like gene which was predicted to encode a long OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein. Interestingly, OAS3-OAS2 fusion genes and proteins are predicted also by annotated GenBank sequences for two additional bat species, Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis brandtii, and three other nonbat species (donkey, ferret, and marmot). Using antiserum to detect OAS3 and OAS2 expression from bat cells, we did not detect a fusion protein for any of the bat species. It is likely that the OAS3-OAS2 fusion genes and resulting fusion protein predicted arise from annotation mistakes in GenBank.",

            "text": "In addition to the OAS genes, two OASL genes encoding OASL1 and OASL2 proteins were detected from genomic sequencing. Alignment of the bOAS and bOASL amino acid sequences with human and mouse protein sequences showed that the bat proteins are more similar to human homologues than to mouse proteins (Table 1 and Fig. 3) . The crystal structure of human (31) and porcine (32) OAS1 has been well studied, and essential amino acids which correspond to dsRNA binding and 2-5A production have been identified. All three bOAS proteins contain highly conserved dsRNA binding amino acid residues as well as catalytic amino acids, suggesting that the bat OASs have the ability to recognize dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. Bats encode bOASL1 and bOASL2, with homology to mouse and human OAS proteins. bOASL2 shares high sequence similarity with mouse OASL2 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), suggesting that Activation of Bat RNase L Depends on OAS3 but Not MAVS \u00ae like the mouse protein, bOASL2 may have catalytic activity. In contrast, humans encode only one enzymatically inactive OASL protein. A recent study suggested that human OASL (enzymatically inactive) and mouse OASL2 (enzymatically active) suppress the function of cGAS-STING pathways (35, 36) . This is surprising since hOASL is more similar to mouse OASL1 than to mouse OASL2 (Fig. S1 ). Nevertheless, it will be interesting to determine if bOASL1 or bOASL2 has a similar function. Xie et al. showed that a point mutation of STING from many bats species attenuates the function of STING (15). Thus, it is possible that bats may use two mechanisms to suppress the cGAS-STING pathway to make the host become more tolerant of viral infection.",

Bat and human Oas1 genes have one similar ISRE, and OAS1 mRNA expression is moderately inducible by IFN or virus infection (40-to 80-fold) in bats (Fig. 2) , similar to our findings in human cells (26) . Interestingly, while the bOas2 gene has two adjacent ISREs and bOas2 mRNA expression is induced only 4-to 6-fold (Fig. 2) , the human Oas2 has one ISRE and yet the expression of OAS2 mRNA is highly induced (10,000-fold) during infection of human cells (26) . Similarly, while bOAS3 has one ISRE, human OAS3 has two ISREs, and OAS3 mRNA induction was about 9-to 15-fold in both bat and human cells with IFN. These findings suggest that the number of ISREs by itself does not have a major influence on the fold induction of OAS gene expression, with the caveat that extent of gene induction will vary with basal expression levels in different cell types. Interestingly, we detected basal OAS3 protein expression in RoNi/7 bat cells and basal OAS2 and OAS3 protein expression in Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts. It is important to note that we cannot directly compare basal expression levels of OAS2 and OAS3 among cells from the various species of bats because the antisera were raised against RoNi/7 cell proteins and may preferentially react to the homologous proteins. Since we were unable to detect bOAS1 protein, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that OAS1 is not expressed in RoNi/7 cells. However, it is more likely that the OAS2 and OAS3 antibodies just do not cross-react with OAS1. This is not surprising as bOAS1 shares lower sequence homology (40%) with the catalytic domains of bOAS2 and bOAS3 than they do with each other. Importantly, further evidence that OAS1 protein is expressed is that the OAS1 gene is intact (Fig. 1) , the mRNA is clearly expressed and induced by IFN or infection (Fig. 2) and contains an ORF encoding a protein very similar to human OAS1 with predicted active site intact (Fig. 3; Table 1 ), and OAS1-KO cells have increased SINV replication (Fig. 6) .",

(Please note that OAS2 is induced in bOAS3-KO cells as well as in WT cells.) These data are similar to our previous findings in several human cell lines, with diverse viruses. This was due to a higher affinity of OAS3 for long dsRNA compared to the shorter OAS1 and OAS2 proteins (21, 22) , which is likely the case for the bat homologues as well. Also consistent with our previous findings in human cells, SINV replication is markedly increased (100-to 200-fold in the bOAS3-KO cells as well as bRNase L-KO cells compared to WT cells). Interestingly, in bOAS1-KO or bOAS2-KO cells SINV also replicates to a higher level than in WT cells, although not to the extent observed in bOAS3-KO or bRNase L-KO cells, and rRNA degradation was observed in cells lacking expression of either bOAS1 or bOAS2. These data suggest that bOAS1 and bOAS2 may exert some antiviral activity by activating RNase L in the absence of bOAS3. In human cells, we previously observed increased SINV replication in OAS1-KO cells at some time points. However, we observed rRNA degradation in OAS1-KO cells, as well as accumulation of 2-5A to the same extent as in WT human cells (26, 38) , suggesting that this antiviral activity mediated by OAS1 in human cells may be at least in part independent of RNase L activation. Consistent with this observation, previous studies concluded that human OAS1 has an antiviral function which is RNase L independent (39) . However, during infection of RoNi/7 cells with VACV\u0394E3L, as we previously found in human A549 cells, degradation of rRNA occurred to a similar extent in the absence of OAS1 and OAS2 as in WT cells and virus replicated to the same extent in OAS1-KO, OAS2-KO, and WT RoNi cells (Fig. 9) , suggesting that only OAS3 played a role in antiviral activity. Further investigation needs to be carried out to understand the individual roles of OAS1 or OAS2 with different viruses and specifically whether there may be OAS-dependent antiviral activities independent of RNase L in bat or human cells.",

            "text": "OAS genes are ISGs, and as such, it has been generally thought that activation of RNase L is a downstream effect of IFN signaling. In this model, viral dsRNA would first need to be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I/MDA5, leading to IFN induction and subsequent upregulation of OASs, which would then be activated by viral dsRNA (40) . However, we found previously that the OAS-RNase L pathway can be activated in the absence of murine coronavirus-induced IFN in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (41) . Here, we show that activation of RNase L during infections with either SINV (Fig. 8) or VACV\u0394E3L (Fig. 9) is independent of MAVS expression in bat RoNi/7 cells, similar to findings for SINV in human A549 cells, indicating that basal OAS levels which are weakly induced in the absence of MAVS (Fig. 8D) are sufficient for activation of RNase L. We recently reported similar results during Zika virus infection of A549 cells (42) . In addition, MAVS plays little if any role in limitation of SINV replication in bat or human cells (Fig. 8B and E) or of VACV\u0394E3L in bat cells (Fig. 9B ). This is in contrast to RNase L, which, as discussed above, dramatically limits viral replication (Fig. 6, 8, and 9) (26) . These results imply that the OAS-RNase L pathway plays a significant role in limiting viral infection before IFN induction or in the absence of IFN by a virus that antagonizes IFN induction or signaling. Indeed, a recent study showed robust RNase L activation as early as 2 h after pIC transfection in human A549 cells (43) . Thus, whereas IFN induction of OASs may enhance the activation of the pathway, it is not always required. These studies suggest that OASs act in parallel to other PRRs, including RIG-I-like receptors, and the OAS-RNase L system is a separate pathway rather than a secondary pathway of IFN induction/signaling. Importantly, OAS-RNase L is a potent antiviral pathway, activated by infection in bat RoNi/7 cells.",
