High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s). The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE. Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding. The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A). Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp. The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment.",

            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage of the viral envelope glycoprotein into a receptor binding and a fusogenic transmembrane subunit is important to regulate virus entry and infectivity [1] . Previous studies showed that viral glycoprotein activation is mediated by secreted proteases recognizing either monobasic or multibasic cleavage sites [2] . Cleavage of viral glycoprotein has been demonstrated in retrovirus, ortho and paramyxoviruses to regulate virus entry and fusion [3, 4, 5] . The extracellular processing of the envelope glycoprotein has a major impact on the infectivity of virulent or avirulent strains of influenza viruses, Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus [6, 7, 8] . A typical example is influenza A virus, where virus-cell fusion activity is induced by post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein that is mediated by trypsin-like protease in the bronchial epithelium and airway secretion [9] . Several proteases such as tryptase clara, mini-plasmin, ectopic anionic trypsin, mast-cell tryptase and tryptase TC30, which have been isolated from airway epithelial, can selectivity cleave the consensus cleavage motif of human influenza A virus envelope glycoprotein [10, 11, 12, 13] and determine the virus tropism and infectivity. Recent advance of human genome studies identified a large number of transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS). Various TMPRSS members with known airway localization have been identified from the respiratory tract. TMPRSS11a, one of the newly identified members of type II transmembrane serine proteases, is expressed in upper respiratory tract (pharynx and trachea) (unpublished data). However, less is known about TMPRSS that activate pneumotropic virus under natural infection.",

Several members of coronavirus possess a protease cleavage site, which is essential for infectivity and virus-cell membrane fusion, and cleavage at these sites yields two non-covalently linked subunits S1 and S2 [16, 17] . The N-terminal S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding whereas the membrane-anchored S2 subunit is important for fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Evidence from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and BCoV suggested the importance of S protein cleavage into two non-covalently linked S1 and S2 subunits that remain on the virus envelope surface during virus maturation [18, 19] . Uncleaved S protein is functional but cleavage may enhance cell fusion activity and/or virus infectivity [20, 21] . Susceptibility of S protein to cleavage depends on virus strains and host cell types. Similar to group I coronaviruses, sequence analysis suggests that S protein from SARS-CoV is not expected to be cleaved since typical amino acid cleavage sites found in coronavirus group II and III (RRFRR, RRSRR, RSRR, RARS and RARR) are not located in the SARS S protein [22] .",

These experiments showed that receptor-binding and subsequent membrane fusion occur with different phases of structural re-arrangements. Possibly, the protease-modified SARS spike glycoprotein is de facto the glycoprotein responsible for virus entry. To address this possibility we have investigated whether cleavage has any significant effect on SARS-CoV entry into airway epithelial cells by using S-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (SARS-CoVpp) encoding a luciferase reporter gene to mimic SARS-CoV entry. We observed that SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein can be efficiently cleaved by several airway proteases and that this processing enhances entry of SARS-CoVpp. Furthermore, we have identified the putative cleavage sites of airway proteases and, by site-directed mutagenesis, have determined the role of specific amino acid residue for proteolytic processing of the envelope glycoprotein, and for SARS-CoVpp entry into human airway epithelial cells (16HBE) in vitro. While this manuscript was still in progress, one of the two natural cleavage sites described here, at position 797, was reported in a separate independent study using only trypsin for cleavage [27] . This study further supports and strengthens the demonstration of the critical role of receptor-dependent cleavage of spike protein by airway proteases, providing deeper insights into the exact mechanism of virus entry enhancement.",

In order to study the effects of airway protease on SARS-CoV entry mechanism, the susceptibility of various human airway epithelial cell lines were tested for SARS-CoV S-mediated infection. To monitor SARS-CoV entry, we pseudotyped a lentiviral vector with the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein (referred to herein as SARS-CoVpp). These recombinant viruses encoding the luciferase reporter gene and expressing the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein at the virion surface have been shown to faithfully mimic the SARS-CoV entry process [30] . Three different airway cell lines: 16HBE, BEAS-2B and A549 were analyzed for SARS-CoVpp infection. We observed that only 16HBE cells (human bronchial epithelial cells) were efficiently infected by SARS-CoVpp, with levels of luciferase activity similar to those measured in the positive control cell line VeroE6 ( Figure 1A ). By contrast, another human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and a human alveolar cell line, A549 were nonpermissive to SARS-CoVpp infection ( Figure 1A) . The susceptibility to SARS-S mediated infection correlated well with ACE2 expression [31] , which was indeed detected by RT-PCR only in Figure 1 . Susceptibility of various human airway epithelial cells to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection. A, VeroE6 (10,000 cells/well), 16HBE, BEAS-2B and A549 (20,000 cells/well) cells were seeded onto 96well plates 24 h before SARS-CoVpp infection. Pseudotypes (SARS-CoVpp) were collected from culture medium and concentrated as described previously [33] . SARS-CoVpp were incubated with various cell lines and transduction was measured by determination of the luciferase activity expressed as luminescence counts per second (LCPS). VeroE6 cells were used as positive control. All experiments were performed in triplicates and data are presented as means6SE of two or three independent experiments. B, ACE2 expression from various mammalian airway cell lines. Cell lysates were collected and ACE2 RNA molecules were detected by RT-PCR. Amplified ACE2 cDNA products from 16HBE, BEAS-2B and A549 are shown in lanes 2 to 4, respectively. VeroE6 cell line (lane 1) was used as positive control for ACE2 expression. The quantity of total RNA templates was normalized to b-actin expression as shown from the lower panel.

            "text": "The susceptibility of purified recombinant triSpike proteins to protease cleavage was investigated with airway proteases because SARS-CoV is pneumotropic. Protease cleavage on purified triSpike protein was performed by treating the triSpike protein with airway proteases followed by amino acid sequence analyses. Results indicated that different airway proteases recognize amino acid residues of Spike as cleavage sites (Figure 2A ). We also observed additional bands, migrating between 75 and 150 kDa, which may represent either incomplete cleavage products or a contamination of the immunopurified triSpike. Amino acid sequences corresponding to the cleaved SARS spike were identified and sequenced ( Figure 2A ). The efficiency of protease cleavage activity was also studied by comparing the yields of cleavage products obtained from the HPLC analysis using synthetic peptides corresponding to the cleaved SARS spike sequence. Our results showed that trypsin recognize and cleave peptides at both position R667 and R797 more efficiently than the other proteases. TMPRSS11a cleave peptides at the position R667 more efficiently than R797 whereas plasmin cleaves peptides at the position R797 more efficiently than R667 (data not shown). Sequence analysis of cleavage products showed that trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases cleave the Spike glycoprotein at positions 667 and 797 ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, amino acid residue 667 has been previously proposed to be the potential cleavage site in Spike generating the S1 and S2 subunits [32] . Because protease processing of coronaviruses surface glycoproteins into S1 and S2 subunits is important to activate the fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane during virus entry step [18, 21] , cleavage by trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases at amino acid residue 667 suggests the involvement of airway proteases during virus entry and fusion. Amino acid residue 797 is also sensitive to cleavage by trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases. This site, which lies within the S2 subunit region, could be important for its further rearrangement, possibly bringing the virus envelope and cellular membrane in close proximity to facilitate virus-cell fusion. Altogether, we have identified at least two amino acid residues which are sensitive to airway protease cleavage in vitro and may be important for in vivo virus entry and fusion.",

On the contrary, trypsin and plasmin treatment significantly reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoVpp ( Figure 3A ).

Unbound SARS-CoVpp or empp was washed away and proteases were added. Under these conditions airway protease treatment significantly enhanced the infection by triSpike pseudotypes ( Figure 3B ). To verify if the concentration of airway proteases had any enhancement effects on virus entry, unbound SARS-CoVpp was washed away and various concentrations of proteases were added. The enhancement of SARS-CoVpp entry increased with higher concentration of the proteases ( Figure 3D -F).

Proper virion incorporation requires surface expression of envelope glycoprotein, and is dependent upon correct folding and oligomerization [34, 35] . As shown in Figure 4C , assembly of co-transfected foreign proteins into bona fide pseudoparticles was tested by the presence of the HIV p24 protein of the lentiviral vector backbone in the same samples. The wild-type pseudotypes expressed the envelope glycoprotein as a single band ( Figure 4C ; middle panel, lane 1), suggesting that the envelope glycoprotein was incorporated into pseudotypes. The detection of complexsugar (but not high-mannose) linked envelope in purified pseudotypes indicates that envelope glycoprotein incorporation requires the completion of all the quality-control processes along the secretory pathway [35] . In contrast, the double mutant (R797AR667A) exhibited a complete lack of pseudotype incorporation of envelope glycoprotein ( Figure 4C ; middle panel, lane 4), illustrated by the presence of p24 in the absence of mature envelope glycoprotein ( Figure 4C ; lower panel, lane 4). Surprisingly, the single mutants (R667A and R797A) exhibited differential patterns of envelope glycoprotein incorporation into pseudotypes ( Figure 4C ; middle panel, lanes 2-3). Both constructs displayed a band pattern similar to that of wild-type, suggesting that the envelope glycoprotein was expressed in transfected cells. However, only R667A was detected in purified pseudotypes. The absence of R797A envelope glycoprotein incorporation into the pseudotypes may be due to a disruption of folding and/or oligomerization along the secretory pathway.",

Unbound pseudotypes were washed away and proteases were added. Our results showed that both the wild-type and mutant spike glycoproteins were functional and mediated virus entry into 16HBE cells ( Figure 5A and 5B) . Whereas airway protease treatment significantly increased the entry of SARS-CoVpp into susceptible cells ( Figure 5A ), this enhancing effect was completely abrogated with R667App ( Figure 5B ). Our data indicate that the arginine residue at position 667 is sensitive to airway protease cleavage which, in turn, significantly increases SARS-CoV infectivity.

Proteolytic modification of spike glycoproteins is the major determinant of virus tropism and pathogenicity as shown in pneumotropic viruses whose infectivity is determined by airway proteases [5, 36, 37] . A monobasic cleavage site has been identified in various viral glycoproteins and is recognized by proteases secreted by epithelial cells [2] . Our data demonstrate that SARS spike glycoprotein has two monobasic cleavage sites that are susceptible to airway protease cleavage. We show here that specific airway proteases secreted along the respiratory tract, such as trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a, recognize and cleave the same two monobasic motifs on the SARS spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, we have taken advantage of the flexibility of pseudotyped particles to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying initial steps of virus entry following cell attachment. We have observed that protease cleavage of spike glycoprotein greatly enhances entry but only after receptor-binding interaction at the cell surface. These observations suggest that proteolytic processing of bound spike results in a conformational change that favors entry of the virus. This is the first report which demonstrates the functional impact of disrupting cleavage at position 667, which had not been addressed before. More importantly, it clarifies the mechanism of virus entry enhancement by several airway proteases. Our data are in agreement with the recent study showing that SARS-CoV S-mediated virus entry is dependent on the sequential proteolytic cleavage of monobasic sites [27] .",

We have observed differential virion incorporation, which is dependent on surface expression of envelope glycoproteins, correlating with the proper folding and post-translational modification of the envelope glycoprotein [35] . Our data is consistent with previous studies indicating that SARS spike producing cells express both the high-mannose and complexsugar linked envelope glycoprotein [33] , and showed that complex-sugar linked SARS spike glycoprotein is solely incorporated into SARS-CoVpp. The SARS spike double mutant (R797AR667A) had defects in virion incorporation, likely due to the impaired post-translational modification of the envelope glycoprotein. Surprisingly, even mutant R797A showed a lack of virion incorporation. We postulate that the defect in this case is due to the impaired oligomerization of envelope glycoprotein. Amino acid residue 797 is located within the S2 region of SARS spike glycoprotein, which is important for trimeric envelope glycoprotein formation (unpublished observations). As a result, any mutations at this residue might generate localized folding defects of the envelope glycoprotein, and cause reduced levels of stable surface expression that prevent efficient incorporation into pseudotypes. A separate study has recently demonstrated the incorporation of a similar mutant construct (R797N) into a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based pseudotyping vector [27] . The difference in mutant envelope incorporation with respect to our study might be attributed to the greater hydrophobicity of our substituted amino acid, which disrupts the oligomerization process. Clearly, further investigation will be required to assess the role of this amino acid residue in SARS spike oligomerization.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of intracellular proteases treatment (e.g. cathepsin L) in activating the membrane fusion property of SARS spike [51, 52] . For example, an important role of R797 cleavage site has been shown by artificially inserting a furin cleavage site, which resulted in the production of cleaved spike glycoprotein pseudotype, and allowed the infection of cells in the presence of protease inhibitors [52] . However, wild-type SARS spike has no putative furin cleavage motif/site. In addition, SARS-CoV has primarily respiratory tropism where a number of extracellular proteases are secreted by the airway epithelium. Therefore, our results suggest that, extracellular airway proteases localized along the respiratory tract cleave and modify the wildtype SARS spike during the very early stage of virus entry (viz., virus-cell attachment step). This modification enables the formation of a cleaved form of spike, and facilitates the activation of membrane fusion by subsequent intracellular protease treatment. It remains possible that the sequential activation of extracellular and intracellular proteases facilitates SARS-CoV entry along the respiratory tract. Another aspect which should be considered is that the cleavage sites described in this report were identified using soluble spike protein, and it is conceivable that additional sites may be involved upon receptor binding. However, the impact of the R667A mutation clearly indicates the functional importance of cleavage at this position for virus entry.",

However, our data demonstrates that the effective concentrations of airway proteases inducing SARS-CoV entry enhancement was at least 100-fold less than that previously reported [24] . This difference could be due to the duration of airway protease treatment onto virus-adsorbed cells, the cleavage efficiency of airway proteases or the sensitivity of the detection system used. Of note, we found that the enhancing effect of airway proteases on SARS-CoVpp entry is strictly dependent on the virus-cell attachment step.",

We clearly observed that pre-treatment of SARS-CoVpp with airway proteases dramatically reduced the infectivity of pseudotype particles, whereas the addition of airway proteases after virus-cell attachment enhanced virus-cell fusion. We postulate that receptorbound spike glycoprotein is required for cleavage mediated virus entry enhancement, as the spike glycoprotein undergoes conformational changes once it binds to the cellular receptor. It is believed that envelope glycoprotein undergoes multiple programmed conformational changes during cellular receptor interaction [53, 54, 55] . This process will expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide and mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membranes [56] . We have shown, however, that entry of SARS-CoVpp could still complete without addition of airway proteases. Several possibilities could account for this finding. First, SARS-CoVpp could enter 16HBE cells through an endosomal pathway as described previously [23] ; alternatively, there could be a partial switch of spike glycoprotein from inactive to active conformation upon receptor binding. We hypothesize that, in the presence of airway proteases, cleavage of receptor-bound spike glycoprotein might reduce the threshold for conformational change of spike glycoprotein into its fusogenic form, thus facilitating the exposure of fusion peptide and its interaction with host cell membranes.",

The mixture was removed; cells were washed twice with complete DMEM medium and incubated overnight at 37uC, in 5% CO 2 . Luciferase activity measurements were performed as described above.",

Cleavage products were visualized and prepared as described in Materials and Methods. Amino acid sequences (T1, T2, P1, P2, N1, and N2) corresponding to the cleaved triSpike proteins are shown in the lower panel.

A, Different putative spike glycoprotein sequences from SARS-CoV isolates were obtained from NCBI. Name of SARS-CoV isolates and GenBank accession numbers are listed. Potential airway protease cleavage residues are highlighted in green. B, Three mutant constructs were made from the wild-type SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein cDNA cloned in the vector pcDNA3.1 as described in Materials and Methods. C, Cell lysates were collected from 293T cells 48 h post transfection. Pseudotypes were collected from culture medium and concentrated as described previously[33]. Samples (cell lysates or pseduotypes) were denatured, reduced and analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel and Western Blot using M2 monoclonal antibody against the FLAG peptide. Sizes of molecular weight markers are indicated on the right. Wild-type SARS spike (lane 1), R667A (lane 2), R797A (lane 3), R797AR667A (lane 4) and pseudotype without envelope (lane 5). D, Analysis of various types of SARS-CoVpp for viral entry. SARS-CoVpp (wild-type or mutant SARS S glycoprotein) were incubated with 16HBE cells and transduction was measured by determination of the luciferase activity (LCPS).
