The NCBI database was accessed on September 15, 2014 and at that time < 20% of the EVD68 2014 outbreak sequences were included. Briefly, total nucleic acid was obtained by extraction using the NucliSENS easyMag platform (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) and 4\u03bcL of the eluate was added to a 20 \u03bcL total volume reaction mixture [1XTaqMan RT-PCR mix (TaqMan RNA-to-C T 1-Step Kit, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 1XTaqMan RT Enzyme Mix, 0.25\u03bcM of each primer: EVD68F (5'-AAAACCATGACGC TAGACATGA-3') and EVD68R (5'-GGCCGGAGGACTCTAT-3') and 0.9\u03bcM of probe EVD68P (5'-VIC-CAAGGTGTGAAGAGTCTATT-MGB-3')]. The RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 thermocycler (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with the following running conditions: 48\u02daC for 15 min, followed by 10 min at 95\u02daC, 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15s and 50\u02daC for 1 min. Semiquatitative genomic EV-D68 loads were quantified using Ct values, which reflect the number of amplification cycles that are required for a positive PCR test. Thus the higher the Ct value the lower the amount of genomic EV-D68.",

We also found that although severe disease was most prominent in children with a history of asthma or wheezing, EV-D68 had a significant impact on children with other co-morbidities, independent of viral burden. Last, we confirmed that the 2014 EV-D68 strains clustered in clade B, along with other reported US strains, but clustered differently than isolates from previous years, suggesting that the 2014 strains belong to a new sublineage.",

We also found that African American children were more commonly infected with EV-D68, which has not been reported before and may be related to the higher prevalence of asthma in this population. [24] In addition and contrary to RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections, co-detection of other viruses or bacteria was uncommon. Although the lack of co-detection with other respiratory viruses could have been related to the seasonality of the outbreak, a time of the year when the circulation of other respiratory viruses is usually low, it also suggests the major role of EV-D68 in association with severe acute respiratory distress.",

[13] In our study 68% of children with EV-D68 were admitted to the PICU, which is similar to the rates reported by Midgley et al [11] , but significantly higher compared to the 20% reported by others. [10, 13, 14] Nevertheless, once admitted, PICU length of stay was comparable between children with EV-D68 vs. those in the RV/EV-non-EV-D68 group. The variance in PICU admissions between our study and others could be attributed to differences in clinical practices followed at different institutions. In our institution, administration of invasive or non-invasive ventilator support, as well as (IV) magnesium, which is associated with hypotension, is managed in the PICU. In the present study, of the 131 children with EV-D68 infection treated in the PICU, 95% received either invasive or non-invasive ventilation and/or IV magnesium, suggesting that EV-D68 patients met appropriate criteria for PICU admission at our institution. No cases of acute flaccid myelitis or deaths, which have been reported in approximately 1% of infected patients, were found in our study. [7, 12] The burden of EV-D68 in children with chronic medical conditions has not been well characterized. A recent study conducted in the US showed that non-EV-D68 RV/EV infections were more common in children with underlying medical conditions while EV-D68 was identified in about 1/3 of these patients, which is in agreement with our findings. [13] We also found that the presentation of EV-D68 in children with chronic medical conditions was similar to those with asthma or previously healthy, with low grade fever and severe respiratory distress, which was present on admission in 70% to 87% of cases. However, duration of supplemental oxygen, PICU length of stay, and overall duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in those patients compared to previously healthy or asthmatic children. Viral burden in these children was also comparable and did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Thus, while children with a history of asthma or wheezing were more likely to require PICU treatment, children with chronic medical conditions were also affected and carried significant morbidity.",

            "text": "Our findings regarding the detection of EV-D68 in previous years revealed the circulation of EV-D68 before the 2014 outbreak. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of the partial VP1 region clearly showed that the 2014 NCH strains grouped with other US strains circulating during the 2014 outbreak, in one distinct phylogenetic cluster in clade B, but separately than strains from 2011 that clustered in a different sublineage in clade B, or the 2012 NCH strain that clustered in clade A. Similar to other publications, our findings suggest that these 2014 NCH strains may represent viral evolution and a possible new sublineage [15, 16] . Nevertheless, and although limited because of the small number of patients, the phenotype of children with EV-D68 infection from 2011 to 2013 and 2014 was similar. These findings are in agreement with others who have reported sporadic detection on EV-D68 prior to 2014 with a similar clinical picture. [3, 22, 23] The analysis of the amino acid sequence focused in the BC and DE loops of the VP1 protein, showed that NCH 2014 strains had a similar pattern of substitutions compared to other 2014 US strains but different compared with strains from prior years. [25] It is known that the VP1 protein is exposed on the surface of the intact virion and contains a serotype specific neutralization site. Nevertheless, the association of these changes and whether they impact neutralization, the host response or the severity of illness are not known. [15] There are limitations to our study, some of them inherent to a retrospective study design. It is possible that unmeasured confounders and selection bias may have influenced the results since we only analyzed hospitalized patients, representing the more severe forms of the disease. The same type of bias applied to RV/EV-non-EV-D68 patients, which made the groups comparable. Additionally, we used a convenience sampling since not all respiratory samples were available for EV-D68 PCR testing, and thus our cohort may not be a complete representation of all patients that developed EV-D68 infection. Nevertheless, the proportion of samples that tested positive for RV/EV-non-EV-D68 during 2014 and in prior years was 40%, yet the number of cases positive for EV-D68 was significantly higher in 2014. Last, while we were able to compare children with chronic medical conditions with those that were previously healthy or had a history of asthma, we were not able to compare specific conditions such as immunodeficiency or congenital or cardiovascular conditions due to the relatively small number of patients.",

In addition, we identified EV-D68 from previous years and provided both clinical and molecular data for these isolates compared to the outbreak isolates. While a history of asthma has been demonstrated as a potential risk factor for severe disease, EV-D68 may also have a significant impact on children with other co-morbidities. These findings warrant further study and the possible implementation of routine, rapid EV-D68 diagnosis to further define the burden and circulation of EV-D68 in children. ",
