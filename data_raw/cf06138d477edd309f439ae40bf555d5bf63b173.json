But analysis of such data is challenging owing to the dependency between observations that is typically observed in an outbreak and to missing data. In this paper, we discuss strategies to tackle some of the ongoing challenges in the analysis of outbreak data. We present a relatively generic statistical model for the estimation of transmission risk factors, and discuss algorithms to estimate its parameters for different levels of missing data. We look at the problem of computational times for relatively large datasets and show how they can be reduced by appropriate use of discretization, sufficient statistics and some simple assumptions on the natural history of the disease. We also discuss approaches to integrate parametric model fitting and tree reconstruction methods in coherent statistical analyses. The methods are tested on both real and simulated datasets of large outbreaks in structured populations.",

For example, we may observe the date of symptoms onset of a case, but we rarely know where, when and by whom a case was infected. Inference, therefore, requires integrating over 'missing data', which may quickly become cumbersome. Over the last 15 years, data augmentation methods have been used to tackle this problem: data are augmented with missing data (e.g. dates of infection) that are needed to write down the likelihood; in a Bayesian setting, the joint posterior distribution of parameters and augmented data is explored usually via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [1] . This methodology is now well established in the field and has been successfully applied to analyse a range of complex datasets.",

This usually requires that the statistical model used to analyse the data is explicitly based on a mechanistic model of disease spread [12] . Transmission parameters of interest, for example, the reproduction number (the number of individuals infected by a case), are usually mathematically defined in those models. Fitting such parametric mechanistic models to outbreak data can give useful insights on transmission [7, [13] [14] [15] , but is subject to the same limitations as parametric fitting in other fields. For example, although there are some exceptions [10] , the approach usually requires to predefine time intervals on which transmission rates are constant. This can sometimes be difficult to achieve in a non-ad hoc way.",

Fitting a mechanistic model seems to be the only way to account for the depletion of susceptibles, the information on uninfected individuals leading to a quantification of relative risks; and it may ensure a better control of the variance of the estimates. Tree-reconstruction methods can provide further insights on what effectively happened during the outbreak with summary statistics on who was infected by whom, when and where and temporal change in the reproduction number. They can also provide a framework to detect abnormal features in the data that are not initially accounted for in a mechanistic model. It is therefore important that the two approaches can be integrated in a coherent way.",

The pseudo-code for this algorithm is given in box 1.

If the incubation period (time lag between the day of infection and the day of symptoms onset) has a known density f (s j jt j ), a common strategy to tackle the problem is to augment the data with the day of infection of each case. A particular computational burden is then that updating the day of infection of a single case may require re-calculation of the whole likelihood as the update may affect the risk of infection of all other individuals. In order to avoid this computational cost, we introduce the additional assumption: (H1) Given the day of symptoms onset s j , infectiousness over time is independent of the day of infection t j . This is, for example, the case if infectiousness starts with symptom onset. This assumption seems acceptable for a relatively wide range of diseases since infectivity is often triggered or influenced by symptoms.

This is because, although maximum-likelihood point estimates could be derived from the likelihood for the 'complete' dataset, estimation of the variance of the estimates has to rely on the likelihood of the observed dataset (equation 3.2). This expression cannot be computed here since days of infection are not observed.

Control measures targeting community, household and hospital transmission each with an efficacy of reducing transmission of 50 per cent are implemented on day 60 of the outbreak. We consider different scenarios for the proportion of cases that are detected in the population. Initially, we assume that all cases are detected. In alternative scenarios, we investigate the situations where 50 or 25 per cent of cases are randomly detected in the community/hospital, but where follow-up of households with detected cases is good (90%) and, last, the situation where detection of cases among household members is of the same quality as detection of cases in the community and in hospitals.",

In the FMD application, discretization reduced the computational time from few weeks to few minutes with no change in the estimates of the transmission kernel. It is likely that with substantial effort and parallel programming, we could have reduced the computation time of brute force approach by one or two orders of magnitude. Even so, it seems unlikely that computational times could have gone much below few days. This has to be compared with the few minutes needed to run our algorithms on the FMD dataset. For small datasets, discretization may provide no computational gain if it takes longer to explore the set C of transmission risk factors than to sum over the pairs fcase i, individual jg. Discretization may be difficult to implement on particularly complex transmission models [19, 23] in which case brute force calculation of the likelihood may be needed.",

A nice feature of simultaneous inference is that the information on the transmission For situations when the dates of infection are unknown, we presented models which assumed that infectivity depends on the time elapsed since symptom onset, and is independent of the time of infection. This assumption reduces the computational burden since it implies that the infection hazard an individual is exposed to solely depends on measured quantities plus the parameters of the model, rather than on the unobserved days of infection of other cases. In practice, assumption H1 seems acceptable for a relatively wide range of diseases since infectivity is often triggered or influenced by symptoms. However, where the assumption is invalid, more computationally intensive methods accounting for the unobserved times of infection become necessary [23] .",

The simulation study showed that even in situations where under-reporting is substantial (e.g. 50%), it would still be possible to obtain informative estimates of key characteristics. We found that estimates of the transmission rate in the community and in the hospital were relatively robust to under-reporting in those settings. This can be explained by the fact that in a large population, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic is not affected by under-reporting. But estimates of transmission rates in small social units such as households were-as might be expected-strongly affected by under-ascertainment of cases. Estimates of relative infectivity were particularly sensitive to underreporting, with large variance and sometimes important bias. Estimating relative infectivity is in general quite challenging because it requires that one can compare the offspring of one group of individuals (e.g. adults) with that of another group (e.g. children) and this becomes very difficult as under-reporting increases. It is likely that estimates would be less robust to underreporting, if reporting rates changed over time, as probably happens in real epidemics.",

In the simulations study, for example, we made the assumption that the distribution of the incubation period of the disease was known.
