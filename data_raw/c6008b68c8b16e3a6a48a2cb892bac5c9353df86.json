Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients.",

            "text": "The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has made a great impact to the health care systems around the world. The pandemic affected over 8000 individuals and resulted in 774 deaths worldwide [1] . Several clinical parameters, including male sex [2, 3] , age of over 60 years [2, 3] , elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity [2] [3] [4] , low platelet count [2] and high viral load on presentation [5] , have been identified to be predictive of the severity of the disease in affected individuals. Moreover, it has been postulated that genetic variations of the host and the virus may account for the individual difference in the susceptibility to the infection and the severity of the disease. With regard to viral factors, it has been shown that there is no significant difference in the genetic sequences of viruses causing the two major outbreaks in Hong Kong, namely the Prince of Wales Hospital and Amoy Gardens outbreaks, despite the significant difference in the mortality rates and diarrheal rates of the two cohorts [6] . Furthermore, several association studies have been conducted to investigate the possible contribution of host genetic factors in the determination of the susceptibility and prognosis of SARS-coronavirus infection. Thus, certain human leukocyte antigen subtypes have been shown to be more prevalent in SARS patients [7] and in those who had poorer outcomes [8] . On the other hand, the polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme II gene, coding for a functional receptor of the SARS-coronavirus, is not associated with the susceptibility or outcome of SARS [9] . Recently, it has also been reported that the deletion of the 287 bp Alu repeat (D allele) in intron 16 of the ACE gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients [10] . However, there are several limitations to this previous study. First, only 44 SARS patients were studied. Second, hypoxemia was arbitrarily defined as requiring oxygen supplementation. Moreover, patients who died were excluded from the study. These factors may be potential confounders to a genetic association study. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the association of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the 287 bp Alu repeat to the susceptibility to SARS and the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a larger population.",

In contrast to a recent report showing an association between the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene and hypoxemia in SARS patients [10] , we have shown that the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with neither increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection nor progression to ARDS once infected. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we have identified that age is the only significant factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independently associated with the requirement of intensive care in SARS There are several possible explanations for the discrepancies in our conclusion and that by Itoyama et al [10] concerning the association between ACE polymorphism and the outcome of SARS. First, the inclusion of subjects within the same family and exclusion of deceased patients by the previous study might cause potential bias, especially when the frequency of the DD genotype was reported to be as low as 6% in control subjects [10] . In this study, we have only included the index patient if more than one member in a family developed SARS. Second, we have used a well defined endpoint of ARDS instead of the requirement of supplemental oxygen. SARS infection commonly leads to respiratory distress and over 80% of patients were given supplemental oxygen during the course of their illness in our cohort. Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to use ARDS instead of the requirement of oxygen supplement to define the severity of SARS. As ARDS is the more severe end of the spectrum of disease progression, any potential association between genotype and disease progression would become even more obvious when the most severe cases were considered. Similarly, the disease outcome was not associated with ACE I/ D genotype when we also used another broader definition for severe disease after SARS infection (requiring intensive care or death).",

However, it is unclear whether these observations can also be seen in Chinese as the frequencies of DD genotype and D allele of the ACE gene are much lower in Chinese than in Caucasian subjects [13, 16] . Furthermore, the SARScoronavirus characteristically affects the pneumocytes, and the formation of multinucleated pneumocytes and intrabronchial fibrogranulation (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like lesions) are commonly observed in the lung biopsies of SARS patients in addition to the typical pathological changes of ARDS [17] .
