Its blockade has been demonstrated to delay chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular damage in diabetic patients. In this sense, since local RAS has been described, the aim of this study is to characterize angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities, as well as protein expression, in several tissues of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice model. After 21 or 40 days of diabetes onset, mouse serums and tissues were analyzed for ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities and protein expression. ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities were detected in different tissues. Their expressions vary depending on the studied tissue. Thus, whereas ACE activity was highly expressed in lungs, ACE2 activity was highly expressed in pancreas among the studied tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that diabetes up-regulates ACE mainly in serum, lung, heart, and liver, and ACE2 mainly in serum, liver, and pancreas. In conclusion, we found a marked serum and pulmonary alteration in ACE activity of diabetic mice, suggesting a common regulation. The increase of ACE2 activity within the circulation in diabetic mice may be ascribed to a compensatory mechanism of RAS.",

Through this catalytic domain, ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII (angiotensin II) to generate Ang1-7, a peptide that binds to the MAS receptor (Ang1-7 receptor) and activates vasodilation, anti-fibrosis, anti-proliferation, and anti-inflammatory effects as well as counterbalances the ACE-AngII-ATR1 axis actions [4] [5] [6] .",

However, ACE2 and ACE enzymes have not been extensively studied in other tissues from diabetic mice. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice is a strain that spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes that mimics type 1 diabetes in humans [23, 24] . We hypothesized that ACE2 and ACE enzymes are present in different tissues other than kidney and differentially expressed. In addition, the administration of insulin can alter ACE2 and ACE expression within these tissues from NOD mice. For this purpose, we studied both ACE and ACE2 activities as well as their protein expression in several tissues from NOD diabetic mice. We also analyzed the effect of diabetes on ACE2 and ACE modifications in tissues from NOD diabetic mice as compared to non-obese resistant (NOR) mice. In addition, we assessed the effect of insulin administration on ACE2 and ACE expression in the studied tissues.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that ACE and ACE2 activities are present in different tissues.

Of note that, ACE activity measurement based on fluorimetric quantification is the most widely used technique because of its sensitivity, simplicity, speed, and high reproducibility [32] . In 1971, Cushman and Cheung developed an ACE activity assay using synthetic ACE-specific substrates, including one of the substrates most commonly cited in literature, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) [33] . As an indirect determination, this technique is based on the hydrolysis of HHL and the measurement of fluorescence through the o-phthalaldialdehyde adducts formation with HHL [34] . In this work, ACE activity was indirectly measured using HHL as the substrate for ACE, as previously described. Previous studies have shown that ACE activity from the same samples differs depending on the homogenization buffer used [32, 35] . We now show that borate buffer is the most suitable to detect lower levels of ACE activity, showing better linearity, conferring less variability, and offering a more reliable assay.",

In addition, ACE2 activity was also increased in liver at 40 days of diabetes in NOD mice. With regard to protein expression, ACE2 expression levels were increased in lungs and heart at early stage of diabetes and in pancreas at late stage of diabetes. Previous studies postulated that the differences observed in ACE2 activities are related to ADAM17 sheddase activity [41] .

Female mice only were used because the development of diabetes is more predictable in female than in male NOD mice [43] . Mice were fed with a chow diet and were provided access to tap water ad libitum. The Ethical Committee of Animal Experimentation of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (CEEA-PRBB) (MSO-08-1106) and the Catalan Government (DMAH: 4097) approved this study. Mice had their blood glucose levels determined every two weeks starting at 10 weeks of age. Fasting blood samples from tail vein were obtained and used for glucose level determination with the ACCU-CHEK Compact \u00ae (Roche, St. Cugat, Spain). Female NOD mice were considered diabetic when glucose blood level higher than 250 mg/dL was first detected. NOD diabetic mice were randomly assigned to two groups, without (DB) or with insulin treatment (DB + INS). For blood glucose levels control, insulin pellets (~0.1 U/24 hr/pellet, LinBit, LinShin Canada Inc, Toronto, Canada) were subcutaneously implanted under anesthesia with ketamine and medetomidine. After surgery, atipamezol was injected to revert the effects of medetomidine. Diabetic animals were compared to the non-diabetic strain, NOR (CONT). Studied animals were weekly controlled for body weight and glucose blood levels and were followed for 21 and 40 days after diabetes diagnosis, and then final surgery was performed. The total number of animals included in each study group were the following: eight animals in each CONT group, seven animals in each DB group, and five animals were studied for 21 days with insulin pellet and six animals for 40 days with insulin treatment.",
