Firstly, we predicted and identified experimentally validated epitopes in each of the antigens/proteins of the five known ebolaviruses. Secondly, we generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides from the proteins of ebolaviruses. Thirdly, conserved peptides across all the five ebolaviruses (four human pathogenic species) with no identical sequence in the human proteome, based on 1000 Genomes project, were identified. Finally, we identified peptide or epitope-based vaccine candidates that could activate both the B-and T-cell arms of the immune system. In addition, we also identified efficacious siRNAs against the mRNA transcriptome (absent in human transcriptome) of all the five ebolaviruses. It was observed that three species can potentially be targeted by a single siRNA (19mer) and 75 siRNAs can potentially target at least two species. A web server, EbolaVCR, has been developed that incorporates all the above information and useful computational tools (http://crdd.osdd.net/oscadd/ebola/).",

These genomes have sizes between 18-19 kb with 40-42% GC content. There are seven genes present in EBOV with two variants of glycoproteins (GP) gene in RESTV and SUDV, while three splice variants have been annotated in other species. Following are the splice variants of GP; i) GP is the spike protein, ii) sGP: (soluble GP) is the default 7A variant and iii) ssGP: (small soluble GP) is a -1A(6A) variant. The alignment file for each protein/mRNA across the different species was generated using ClustalW 24 . Viral-specific conserved patterns. In order to investigate virus-specific conserved patterns, overlapping patterns of 9 amino acids (9mer) were generated, from proteins of above-mentioned five ebolaviruses. There were 43 proteins in total (including different splice variants of GP gene) from the five ebolaviruses. Further, all the possible 9mer peptides from each protein were predicted for their immunological potential. One of the challenges in vaccine development is to avoid self-tolerance as the body's immune system rarely acts against self-antigens. Thus, all those 9mers that are available in the human body (or human genome) were removed. In order to achieve this goal, we removed all those viral patterns that are 100% identical to any pattern found in human thousand proteomes. Human thousand proteomes were created by using 1000 Genomes data and translating it to proteins sequences 25, 26 . This led us to the 9mer peptide/pattern that is found in this virus but absent in human proteomes. In order to develop an effective vaccine against a wide range of species, it is important to identify conserved patterns across the different species of Ebola. Therefore, this study involves the identification of unique patterns of 9mer peptides along with the frequency of their occurrence across different ebolaviruses. Also, a high priority was given to a pattern, which was common in the most number of ebolaviruses, which led to patterns/peptides of size of 9 residues that were conserved among ebolaviruses.",

But these studies were limited in terms of the number of proteins covered and the types of immune responses considered [46] [47] [48] . We have observed the peptides (9mers) that are capable of stimulating different kinds of immunity. In the current study, we have uncovered 123 conserved peptides among all the human pathogenic ebolavirus that can activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In addition to CTL activation, we have also identified 42 peptides that can activate the T helper response after binding with MHC class II. We have also eliminated the peptides that could share sequence identity with the human proteome to avoid any cross-reaction of vaccine candidates with human proteins. We are hopeful that these vaccine candidates will provide better immunity and lead to a successful vaccine in the future.

It was observed that 1138 epitopes, covered in our study, out of 1513 peptides were available in IEDB. This demonstrates the validity of our predictions. In addition, we suggested 16 epitopes in our study, one of which has been validated experimentally to bind with 2 MHC alleles (HLA*24-02, HLA-B*07:02). The peptide (IPVYQVNNL) was identified and submitted to IEDB (http://www.iedb.org/epId/91517) 49 in 2009 by Kent J. Weinhold, Georgia D. Tomaras, Yongting Cai, Kelly Plonk, Scott Pruitt and Smita K. Nair. siRNA therapy. The most potential siRNAs against every gene are reported in this study. We have predicted the efficacy of exclusive siRNAs against all the genes of known ebolaviruses and found that none of the siRNAs is present against all the five ebolaviruses. There are 75 siRNAs, which are shared by any two species, and 1 siRNA is shared by three species (BDBV, EBOV and RESTV). In this study, we used a published siRNA efficacy predictor named 'desiRm' , developed by our group. One may question the use of desiRm software when a large number of existing software packages for predicting the efficacy of siRNA are available. We used it because its standalone version allowed us to analyze a large number of 19mer oligonucleotides. Further, this algorithm has been shown to have comparable performance with the other methods 34 . Thus, selection is purely based on availability and not on any other criteria, like performance.",
