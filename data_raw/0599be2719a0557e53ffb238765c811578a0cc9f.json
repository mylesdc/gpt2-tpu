The rapid and sensitive detection of RSV is important to minimize the incidence of infection. In this study, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; B11A5 and E8A11) against RSV nucleoprotein (NP) were developed and applied to develop a rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT), employing europium nanoparticles as the fluorescent material. For the FICT, the limits of detection of the antigen and virus were 1.25 \u00b5g/mL and 4.23 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL, respectively, corresponding to 4.75 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 5.8 \u00d710 5 (mean \u00b1 SD) RNA copy numbers per reaction mixture for RSV NP. A clinical study revealed a sensitivity of 90% (18/20) and specificity of 98.18% (108/110) for RSV detection when comparing the performance to that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), representing a 15% improvement in sensitivity over the SD Bioline rapid kit. This newly developed FICT could be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of RSV infection.",

RSV is a widespread human pathogen because the immunity that is obtained after RSV infection might not be protective, frequently leading to reinfection. Approximately 90% of children become infected within the first two years of life, and this virus frequently re-infects older children and adults. The majority of patients with RSV infection develop upper respiratory illness, but a significant minority will present with lower respiratory tract illness, predominantly in the form of bronchiolitis.",

E8A11 was not able to detect RSV in the absence of a suitable lysis buffer, which was confirmed by IFA, as shown Figure S1 . After investigation of SDS and pH, lysis buffer (0.1 M tris, 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% triton X-100, and 1% SDS. pH 8.0) was found to be suitable for the detection of virus by the two antibodies using IFA. The reactivity of the mAbs to RSV in the presence of lysis buffer was shown by IFA ( Figure 2A ). In the presence of lysis buffer, positive signals in RSV-infected cells were observed for both antibodies and a commercial monoclonal antibody against RSV NP. Western blotting revealed a major band at 46 kDa, indicating the reactivity of B11A5 and E8A11 against denatured RSV NP ( Figure 2B ). The B11A5 and E8A11 isotypes were both found to be IgG2b ( Figure 3 ). respiratory syncytial virus nucleoprotein (RSV-NP) was expressed in an E. coli system and purified using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA Agarose). The upper panel shows the SDS-PAGE results, and the lower presents Western blot results with an anti-His-6\u00d7 tag antibody. 1, marker; 2, bovine serum albumin (BSA); 3, supernatant after induction; 4, pellet after induction; 5, purified RSV recombinant NP (rNP).

(B) Secreted antibodies in the supernatants of two hybridomas were tested with recombinant NP (10 \u00b5g/mL) using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Influenza A H1N1 virus as negative control. Finally, purified antibodies (B11A5 and E8A11) were tested with virus (1 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 /mL) by performing an indirect ELISA in the absence or presence of lysis buffer.
