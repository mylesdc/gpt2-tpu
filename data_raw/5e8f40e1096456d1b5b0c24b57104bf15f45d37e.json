            "text": "The p7 protein from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a 63 amino acid long polypeptide that is essential for replication, and is involved in protein trafficking and proton transport. Therefore, p7 is a possible target for antivirals. The consensus model for the channel formed by p7 protein is a hexameric or heptameric oligomer of a-helical hairpin monomers, each having two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2, where the N-terminal TM1 would face the lumen of this channel. A reported highthroughput functional assay to search for p7 channel inhibitors is based on carboxyfluorescein (CF) release from liposomes after p7 addition. However, the rationale for the dual ability of p7 to serve as an ion or proton channel in the infected cell, and to permeabilize membranes to large molecules like CF is not clear. We have recreated both activities in vitro, examining the conformation present in these assays using infrared spectroscopy. Our results indicate that an a-helical form of p7, which can transport protons, is not able to elicit CF release. In contrast, membrane permeabilization to CF is observed when p7 contains a high percentage of b-structure, or when using a C-terminal fragment of p7, encompassing TM2. We propose that the reported inhibitory effect of some small compounds, e.g., rimantadine, on both CF release and proton transport can be explained via binding to the membrane-inserted C-terminal half of p7, increasing its rigidity, in a similar way to the influenza A M2-rimantadine interaction.",

However, a non-tagged p7 showed cytoplasmic orientation for its C-terminus, compatible with a form with only one TM domain [21, 22] .

We have used three methods of reconstitution in lipidic membranes. The first two methods coreconstitute p7, after the protein is dried from a solvent, with lipids, either with the aid of detergent -'dialysis' method -or without detergent -'direct' method -. These two procedures may be followed by a freeze-thawing and extrusion protocol. In the third method, -'addition' method -p7 is added directly from solvent to preformed liposomes, as in the CF-release assay [7, 24] . All of these methods have been used previously in the literature. The ability of p7 to elicit CF release and proton transport has been tested in the controled conditions where the p7 conformation was known, which allowed to infer that the 'a-helical hairpin' form is responsible for proton transport, but not of CF release.",

When recombinant p7 was first dried from HFIP, solubilized in detergent and reconstituted in DMPC lipid bilayers, the amide I spectrum showed that most of the protein is a-helical (trace H in Fig. 3A , henceforth referred to as form A), with a peak centered at 1658 cm 21 . In contrast, when recombinant p7 was solubilized first in methanol, a band centered at 1627 cm 21 appeared prominently, indicating an approximate 60/ 40% mixture of a-helix and b-strands, respectively (trace M in Fig. 3A , henceforth referred to as form B). Similar differences were observed using a synthetic form of p7 (not shown). Thus, regardless of the sample origin, a dramatic increase in b-structure is observed when the protein was pre-solubilized and dried from a methanol solution. For the a-helical form A, analysis of the amide I region showed that b-structure constitutes approximately 10-15% of the total, whereas the a-helix content was 73%, i.e., ,48 amino acids. This a-helical content is consistent with the reported 62% obtained for recombinant p7 in DHPC micelles [14] , the 70% obtained for synthetic p7 dissolved in 50% TFE [12] , and a recent NMR structure of a p7 variant in DPC micelles [20] , which is also mostly a-helical and roughly consistent with an a-helical hairpin model with two a-helical TM domains. In contrast, form B obtained after methanol solubilization showed b-structure and ahelical content of 40% and 55%, respectively. This corresponds to ,37 residues forming a-helices, too short to account for the two predicted a-helical TM domains, but too long for a single TM domain. Therefore, this sample is likely to contain incompletely, or incorrectly, reconstituted p7 protein.",

In this case, p7 formed a significant (,40%) proportion of b-structure (Fig. 3C , see bands at 1635 and 1629 cm 21 ) regardless of the solvent used for p7 solubilization prior addition to liposomes: methanol, HFIP or TFE. The presence of b structure in the dyalisis and addition samples when methanol was used (Fig. 3A-B ) may be explained by comparison to the spectra of the dry p7 from HFIP or methanol solution (Fig. 3D) . In the first case, p7 was almost completely ahelical, whereas in the second case, p7 contained more than 50% of b-structure. However, the CD spectra of p7 in HFIP or methanol solution show no differences, with a high (,70%) percentage of helical structure (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that it is the drying procedure than induces b-structure formation, and not the solvent per se. This b-structure is retained even after reconstitution in lipids, unless the sample is extruded repeatedly afterwards. This also explains that when added to preformed liposomes, p7 adopts b-structure regardless of the solvent used (Fig. 3C) ; while p7 is predominantly a-helical in any of these solvents, poor incorporation of p7 in the bilayers after being briefly exposed to the aqueous environment results in bstructure formation.",

To test this, we analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) the contents of the flotation tube, from top to bottom, in 400 mL fractions. The results showed that liposomes were also present at the bottom of the tube in both samples (Fig.  S6 in File S1). The latter suggests that a fraction of the liposomes contains an excessive proportion of p7 protein incorporated, and sinks to the bottom of the tube. The estimated density of the lipid fraction in PAESC liposomes is 1.03 g/mL [35] [36] [37] , whereas the p7 Proton Transport and Dye Release Activities PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org density of the three phases used in the sucrose gradient, 0, 10 and 20%, are 1.01548, 1.05534 and 1.09827 g/mL, respectively. Therefore, pure liposomes should accumulate at the interface between 0 and 10% of sucrose. At the lipid-to-protein ratio molar used in the experiment (100:1), and assuming uniform incorporation, the density of the liposomes should be 1.0499 g/mL, therefore these liposomes should still accumulate at the 0-10% interface. However, if the incorporation is not homogeneous, e.g., if the lipid to protein ratio is between 70:1 and 20:1, the liposomes would be found in the 10% section. The results observed (Fig. S6B in File S1) indicate that some liposomes contain more p7 than that corresponding to a ratio 1:20, as they are found at the bottom of the 20% sucrose section.",

For comparison, we used a similar hydrophobic protein with a single transmembrane (TM) domain, the peptide M2 (18-60) from influenza A, which caused only a minor CF release (Fig. S7 in File S1), suggesting that CF release may be specific for the C-terminal region of p7. In summary, these results show that correct incorporation and native conformation of full length p7 is not necessary to elicit CF release, and that insertion of the TM2 fraction of p7 into lipid bilayers may be sufficient, based on the more hydrophobic nature of TM2. We note that in a recently published structural model of p7 [20] , TM1 and TM2 would correspond to three helical segments H1-H3, i.e., To test if form A is responsible for CF release, we incorporated p7 into CF-containing PAESC liposomes by the dyalisis method, freeze-thawing and extrusion, which should result in p7 incorporation in membranes in an a-helical form A (see Fig. 3B and Fig. 4) . However, after removing non incorporated CF, no significant differences in fluorescence were observed between the CF-loaded control (without p7) and sample (with p7) liposomes (Fig. 5C , white bars). Differences were not observed even 1 h after removing nonincorporated CF. Most or all CF was still encapsulated, as shown by the large increase in fluorescence after Triton X-100 addition in both preparations (Fig. 5C, grey bars) , and kinetics of CF release were also similar to the addition of only methanol to the liposomes (Fig. 5D) . Thus, the result of this experiment is incompatible with form A being responsible for CF release.",

The difficulty in handling and purification of the N-terminal fragment of p7 has been reported previously for p7 Proton Transport and Dye Release Activities PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org p7(1-34) [12] . After solubilization in methanol and 'direct' reconstitution in DMPC liposomes, p7(1-26) produced a spectrum in the amide I consistent with ,100% b-structure (Fig. 6, A-B , dotted line). A high content (,50%) in b-structure was also observed when the peptide was previously solubilized in HFIP (Fig. 6, A-B, solid line) . The C-terminal peptide, p7 in contrast, was more a-helical in both conditions tested (Fig. 6 , C-D), although with more b-structure in the methanol condition. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that neither TM domains of p7, especially TM1, behaves like typical a-helical TM domains in similar membrane proteins. For example, a-helical TM domains in integrins [43] , phospholamban [44] , influenza A M2 [45] , SARS-CoV E [29] , or RSV SH [46] produce sharp amide I bands in the infrared spectrum consistent with ,100% a-helix.",

Nevertheless, both preparations were able to transport protons in a concentration dependent fashion. For comparison, we used influenza A M2 fragment (18-60), a 'classical' proton channel, which was more efficient than p7 (DpH 5 min = 0.2560.03), even at a protein to lipid ratio ,9 times lower (see Materials and Methods). Rimantadine (5 mM) partially inhibited the proton channel activity of p7 (Fig. 7C) , consistent with previous observations [8] . Overall, these results show that form A, consistent with an a-helical hairpin, is responsible for proton transport.

This is supported by the observed direct interaction between the inhibitor amantadine and TM2 leucines 51-57, which have been shown unequivocally to be part of a membrane inserted a-helix [20, 47] , and Leu to Ala mutations at this region of TM2 produced an amantadine resistant p7 mutant [32] . However, amantadine and rimantadine have also been reported to interact with some residues in TM1 when forming an a-helical hairpin [20, 32, 47] . Thus we propose that these drugs interact with membraneinserted TM2, possibly increasing its rigidity (and preventing CF release) when form B is present, and interact with both TM1 and TM2 (inhibiting proton channel activity) when form A is present. Indeed, that amantadine is able to interact with both TM1 and TM2 has been recently confirmed experimentally using p7 in DPC micelles, although the strain used is quite different from ours [20] . The p7 sequence (subtype 5a, strain EUH1480) in that report is less than 50% identical to the sequence used here (1a, H77). Overall, our results suggest that, although a CF release assay may be able to detect p7 channel inhibitors because of the proposed dependency of CF release on membrane-inserted TM2, a proton or ion transport assay is more relevant to discover channel blockers.",

Support for this arrangement is found in the physicochemical properties of TM1 and molecular dynamics simulations [16, 19] , and the observed partial inhibition of p7 channel activity by Cu 2+ , but not by Mg 2+ [17] . Peptides corresponding to TM2 or TM1, e.g., p7(35-63) or p7(1-34) easily aggregate, so that individual channel activity of TM1 or TM2 cannot be properly measured [12] . In the latter paper, peptide TM1 p7(1-34) showed some channel activity that was probably non-specific, because inhibition data was not reported, and the peptide had not been purified [12] . Other reports were unable to measure channel activity for this peptide [5] , and we show that purified peptide p7(1-26) is not even a-helical in presence of lipid bilayers after methanol exposure, and it is only partially helical after HFIP exposure.",

This is not rare in viral proteins; the N terminus of HCV NS4B has been reported to assume dual TM topology, with possible distinct functions, on each side of the ER membrane [48] . In addition, the hepatitis B virus surface L-glycoprotein also adopts different TM topologies, acting during virus assembly as a matrix-like protein, and in virus entry as a receptor-binding protein [49] . Lastly, the Newcastle disease virus fusion protein exists in two topological forms with respect to membranes, one of which has been proposed to be involved in fusion [50] .",

For example, p7-mediated localization of NS2 protein to sites of viral replication in lipid raft regions [9] , or the transfer of HCV core protein from lipid droplets to the ER, which depends on interaction between p7 and NS2 [10] . Incidentally, in this role, the interaction between p7 TM2 and NS2 TM1 was proposed as specially important. p7 also interacts with other viral structural and non-structural proteins that are important to promote virus assembly and release [2, [51] [52] [53] . Lastly, although the present results have been obtained with p7 from subtype 1a, it is likely that these results can be extrapolated to other studies that used different subtypes of HCV p7 because of the .80% identity between sequences of subtypes 1a, 1b and 2a.",

(1) In form B, TM2 is embedded in the lipid bilayer and the extra b-structure is contributed by exposure of TM1 to the aqueous environment. This form is able to release CF (black arrow), but not protons (grey arrow). As part of the B form extends into the extramembrane domain, it is likely to participate in fusion events or membrane destabilization; (2) Form A has two TM domains, TM1 and TM2, separated by a loop, where TM2 lines the lumen of the channel. This form is unable to release CF, but it is able to transport protons. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0078494.g009 Figure S6 . Average count rate versus sample fraction in flotation experiment.
