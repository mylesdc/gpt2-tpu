Qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern based on digital high-speed videomicroscopy analysis has been proposed in the diagnosis process of PCD. Although this evaluation is easy in typical cases, it becomes difficult when ciliary beating is partially maintained. We postulated that a quantitative analysis of beat pattern would improve PCD diagnosis. We compared quantitative parameters with the qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern in patients in whom the diagnosis of PCD was confirmed or excluded. Methods: Nasal nitric oxide measurement, nasal brushings and biopsies were performed prospectively in 34 patients with suspected PCD. In combination with qualitative analysis, 12 quantitative parameters of ciliary beat pattern were determined on high-speed videomicroscopy recordings of beating ciliated edges. The combination of ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities on transmission electron microscopy analysis with low nasal nitric oxide levels was the \"gold standard\" used to establish the diagnosis of PCD.",

Among the 12 parameters, the distance traveled by the cilium tip weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges presented 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis were concordant in non-PCD patients. In 9/10 PCD patients, quantitative analysis was concordant with the \"gold standard\", while the qualitative evaluation was discordant with the \"gold standard\" in 3/10 cases. Among the patients with an inconclusive \"gold standard\", the use of quantitative parameters supported PCD diagnosis in 4/9 patients (confirmed by the identification of disease-causing mutations in one patient) and PCD exclusion in 2/9 patients.",

Although airway symptoms usually begin in early childhood, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed for several years [1, [3] [4] [5] .

Video sequences were played back frame by frame in order to determine three points characterizing the complete cycle of each cilium. These three points correspond to the position of the base of the cilium (P0) and the positions of the tip before the active and recovery strokes (P1 and P2, respectively) (see Figure 1 ). Five time-points were defined at the tip of the cilium corresponding to the steps of one beating cycle: start and arrival of the active stroke (t1 and t2, respectively), start and arrival of the recovery stroke (t3 and t4, respectively) and start of the following beating cycle (t5). These various measurements were used to determine 12 parameters. Global frequency, power stroke duration and recovery duration, the pauses after the active and recovery strokes, total pause, cilia length and beating angle were calculated. The distance travelled by the cilium per second (i.e., the length of the path travelled by the tip in one second) and the area swept per second (i.e., the area swept by the cilium in one second) were also calculated. These two last parameters were then weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges. The formula used to calculate these different parameters is shown in the legend to Figure 1 .",

NO n measurement, which is now classically used in diagnostic procedures [8, 9, 11, 21, 23] , was combined with TEM analysis in order to more accurately define the PCD and non-PCD groups. However, the variants of PCD with normal ciliary ultrastructure are clearly a limitation of such a gold standard as TEM alone misses the diagnosis. Nevertheless, the association of TEM with NO n measurement in our study allowed to de-emphasize this limitation as the patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure and low No n were classified as inconclusive. Evaluation of ciliary beat pattern in culture has already been proposed [24] to distinguish primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia.

Firstly, all of the proposed quantitative parameters were able to be determined in all patients, meaning that beating cilia were always detected, even in the absence of dynein arms. In our experience, the average duration of a complete assessment (including video recording and analysis) is about one hour per patient, allowing this technique to be applied in clinical practice. The mean ciliary beat frequency measured in this study was significantly lower in PCD patients than in non-PCD patients with chronic airway infections, as reported with conventional techniques [3, 10, 14, 26] . The beating angle can be considered to be a parameter evaluating the amplitude of the ciliary beat. Due to the flexible nature of ciliary beat, beating angle remains of course only an indicator of amplitude. In the future, the measurement of the bending angle of the cilia, especially during the power stroke, might be an interesting parameter. However, this measurement will require to increase the amount of measured points on the video of the beating cilia and to develop new algorithms of calculation. All quantitative parameters were significantly different between PCD and non-PCD groups. Weighted distance travelled per second could be useful for PCD diagnosis, as this parameter appeared to be the most discriminative with no overlapping results between PCD and non-PCD groups.",

In the patients with a conclusive gold standard diagnosis, the two methods were always concordant when the ciliary dyskinesia score \u2265 2 or \u2264 0.15, (14 patients, see Table 2 and Figure 5 ), i.e. when ciliary beat pattern was virtually immotile or normal, respectively. In the cases of ciliary dyskinesia score < 2 and or > 0.15 (11 patients see Table 2 and Figure 5 ), i.e. when a moderate alteration of ciliary beat pattern was exhibited, three situations were observed: in 2/11 patients (# 4 and 5), the two methods were discordant and the PCD diagnosis was in accordance with the quantitative analysis; in 8/11 patients (# 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23) the quantitative analysis concluded to the non-PCD diagnosis with a \u2265 98% sensitivity and the qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (between 0.25 and 0.5); in 1/11 patient (# 7) with a conclusive PCD diagnosis, qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (0.25) while the quantitative parameters were just below the threshold of 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons of the discrepancies observed between quantitative and qualitative methods, as the two methods are based on the same concept, i.e., describing a movement from the same high speed video recording. We can speculate that qualitative evaluation does not always allow easy assessment of beat pattern. Scoring ciliary dyskinesia from 1 to 3 depending on the extent of abnormal beating along the edge, as proposed by Chilvers et al. [20] , is clearly more subjective than a physical measurement in a continuous space. Our results suggest that the proposed quantitative analysis is more precise and more sensitive than qualitative evaluation. This gain of precision is especially useful when cilia are still beating but with moderate alterations (more than 40% of patients referred for suspicion of PCD in our center).",

Such a result demonstrates the need to have a new method allowing to better defining PCD. The proposed method is a trial to get a better classification of PCD, based on the dyskinectic pattern. In the inconclusive group, the proposed parameters can be helpful to assess the diagnosis of PCD while the measurement of ciliary beat frequency alone is not helpful. The weighted distance travelled per second is the most discriminating parameter for this purpose. Use of this type of procedure could reclassify two patients as possibly excluded PCD (patients # 26 and 33) and four patients as possibly confirmed PCD (patients # 27, 28, 30 and 34). Very interestingly, for one of these patients (#34), the diagnosis of PCD was confirmed by genetic analysis showing RSPH9 mutations (data not shown). Nevertheless, three patients remained inconclusive for PCD status (patients # 29, 31, 32; see grey symbols in Figure 4 ). Molecular genetics studies would greatly improve diagnostic efficiency, but Figure 4 Evaluation of the efficiency of digital high-speed videomicroscopy in nine patients with an inconclusive diagnosis. In this group, the mean distance travelled by the cilium tip per second weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges, was used to discriminate patients. The PCD and non-PCD cutoffs were < 10 \u03bcm and > 51 \u03bcm respectively. The symbols of the non-PCD and PCD groups represent the mean values \u00b1 standard deviation. In the inconclusive group, white symbols represent patients in whom PCD was possibly confirmed, black symbols represent patients in whom PCD was possibly excluded and grey symbols represent patients in whom digital high-speed videomicroscopy was not helpful for PCD diagnosis. The results of the weighted distance travelled per second is plotted versus the dyskinesia score in the patients with conclusive gold standard. According to Stannard et al.

However, quantitative analysis provides more precise and more sensitive results in the presence of moderate alterations (observed in almost one half of patients in this series). Therefore, it could be very useful in PCD patients representing a challenge for diagnosis, as those with Kartagener syndrome and no ultrastructural defect (patient # 27) [7] and those with central complex defect and low percentage of abnormal cilia combined with residual beating cilia (patient # 34) [16, 27, 28] . Quantitative analysis of beat pattern can also be proposed to select patients eligible for TEM by using a cutoff for weighted distance travelled per second ensuring 100% sensitivity (even with a specificity of 55%). This type of selection would decrease by almost one third the indications for TEM analysis in patients with suspected PCD.This pilot study should promote additional studies on a larger series of patients. Quantitative approaches of ciliary motility are potentially useful to define dyskinesia and dyskinetic pattern for the diagnosis of PCD.",
