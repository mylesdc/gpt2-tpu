The software Cytoscape and the PharmMapper server were utilized to screen for essential proteins in the constructed network. The Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and gamma (CAMK2G) were identified as potential targets. To obtain a deeper insight on the relationship between the toxicity and the structure of aconitine alkaloids, the present study utilized QSAR models built in Sybyl software that possess internal robustness and external high predictions. The molecular dynamics simulation carried out here have demonstrated that aconitine alkaloids possess binding stability for the receptor CAMK2G. In conclusion, this comprehensive method will serve as a tool for following a structural modification of the aconitine alkaloids and lead to a better insight into the cardiotoxicity induced by the compounds that have similar structures to its derivatives. writing-original draft preparation, M.W.; writing-review and editing, K.M.; project administration, F.-H.M.",

They are also involved in the management of endocrinal disorders such as irregular menstruation [1, 2] . However, the usefulness of this aconitine species component intermingles with toxicity after it is administered to a diseased patient. So far, few articles have recorded the misuse of aconitine medicinals with strong emphasis and thus have referenced that the misuse of this medicinal can result in severe cardio-and neurotoxicity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In our past research, it was evidenced that the aconitine component is the main active ingredient in this species' root and rhizome, and is responsible for both therapeutic and toxic effects [8] .",

A combined network analysis and in silico study was once performed to obtain insight on the relationship between aconitine alkaloid toxicity and the aconitine structure, and it was found that the cardiotoxicity of aconitine is the primary cause of patient death. The aconitine poison is similar to the poison created by some pivotal proteins such as the ryanodine receptor (RYR1 and RYR2), the Gap junction \u03b1-1 protein (GJA1), and the sodium-calcium exchanger (SLC8A1) [9] [10] [11] [12] .

A systematic description of these interactions aids in the elucidation of interrelationships among targets. The targeting of PPIs with small-molecule compounds is becoming an essential step in a mechanism study [14] . The present study was designed and undertaken to identify the critical protein that can affect the cardiotoxicity of aconitine alkaloids. A PPI network built by the STRING database is a physiological contact for the high specificity that has been established for several protein molecules and has stemmed from computational prediction, knowledge transfer between organisms, and interactions aggregated from other databases [15] . The analysis of the PPI network is based on nodes and edges and is always performed via cluster analysis and centrality measurements [16, 17] . In cluster analysis, highly interconnected nodes and protein target nodes are divided and used to form sub-graphs. The reliability of the PPI network is identified by the content of each sub-graph [18] . The variability in centrality measurements is connected to the quantitative relationship between the protein targets and its weightiness in the network [18] . Hence, PPI networks with protein targets related to aconitine alkaloid cardiotoxicity must enable us to find the most relevant protein for aconitine toxicity and to understand the mechanism at the network level. In our research, the evaluation and visualization analysis of essential proteins related to cardiotoxicity in PPIs were performed by the ClusterONE and CytoNCA plugins in Cytoscape 3.5, designed to find the potential protein targets via combination with conventional integrated pharmacophore matching technology built in the PharmMapper platform.",

            "text": "Structural modification of a familiar natural product, active compound, or clinical drug is an efficient method for designing a novel drug. The main purpose of the structural modification is to reduce the toxicity of the target compound while enhancing the utility of the drug [19] . The identification of the structure-function relationship is an essential step in the drug discovery and design, the determination of the 3D protein structures was the key step in identifying the internal interactions in the ligand-receptor complexes. X-ray crystallography and NMR were the only accepted techniques of determining the 3D protein structure. Although the 3D structure obtained by these two powerful techniques are accurate and reliable, they are time-consuming and costly [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . With the rapid development of structural bioinformatics and Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) techniques in the last decade, computational structures are becoming increasingly reliable. The application of structural bioinformatics and CADD techniques can improve the efficiency of this process [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The ligand-based quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) and receptor-based docking technology are regarded as effective and useful tools in analysis of structure-function relationships [35] [36] [37] [38] . The contour maps around aconitine alkaloids generated by comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) were combined with the interactions between ligand substituents and amino acids obtained from docking results to gain insight on the relationship between the structure of aconitine alkaloids and their toxicity.",

The statistical parameters for database alignment-q 2 , r 2 , F, and SEE-were Table 1 . The CoMFA model with the optimal number of 6 components presented a q 2 of 0.624, an r 2 of 0.966, an F of 124.127, and an SEE of 0.043, and contributions of the steric and electrostatic fields were 0.621 and 0.379, respectively. The CoMSIA model with the optimal number of 4 components presented a q 2 of 0.719, an r 2 of 0.901, an F of 157.458, and an SEE of 0.116, and the contributions of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrogen bond donor fields were 0.120, 0.204, 0.327, 0.216, and 0.133, respectively. The statistical results proved that the aconitine alkaloids QSTR model of CoMFA and CoMSIA under the database alignment have adequate predictability. Experimental and predicted pLD 50 values of both the training set and test set are shown in Figure 2 , and the CoMFA ( Figure 2A ) and CoMSIA ( Figure 2B ) model gave the correlation coefficient (r 2 ) value of 0.9698 and 0.977, respectively, which demonstrated the internal robustness and external high prediction of the QSTR models. Experimental and predicted pLD50 values of both the training set and test set are shown in Figure  2 Residuals vs. Leverage Williams plots of the aconitine QSTR models are shown in Figure 3A ,B. All values of standardized residuals fall between 3\u03c3 and \u22123\u03c3, and the values of leverage are less than h*, so the two models demonstrate potent extensibility and predictability.

The correlative proteins or pathways are shown in Table 2 . All proteins were taken as input protein in the STRING database to find its direct and functional partners [51] , and proteins and its partners were then imported into the Cytoscape 3.5 to generate the PPI network with 148 nodes and 872 edges ( Figure  4 ).

Six clusters, namely Clusters 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, which possess quality scores higher than 0.5, a density higher than 0.45, and a p-value less than 0.05, were selected for further analysis (in Figure 7) . Clusters 1, 4, and 7 consisted of proteins mainly involved in the effects of various calcium, potassium, and sodium channels. Cluster 1 mainly consisted of three channel types related to the cardiotoxicity of aconitine alkaloids, Cluster 4 contained calcium and sodium channels and some channel exchangers (such as RYR1 and RYR2), and Cluster 7 mainly consisted of various potassium channels. All of these findings are consistent with previous research about the arrhythmogenic properties of the toxicity of aconitine alkaloids: the aconitine binds to ion channels and affects their open state, and thus the corresponding ion influx into the cytosol [53] [54] [55] . The channel exchangers play a crucial role in keeping the ion transportation and homeostasis inside and outside of the cell. Cluster 9 contained some regulatory proteins that can activate or repress the ion channels through the protein expression level. ATP2A1, RYR2, RYR1, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, and CACNA1S mediate the release of calcium, thereby playing a key role in triggering cardiac muscle contraction and maintaining the calcium homeostasis [56, 57] . Aconitine may cause aberrant channel activation and lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Clusters 3 and 5 consisted of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGPK), and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein). They have not been fully studied to prove whether the cardiotoxicity induced by aconitine alkaloids is linked to the cAPK, cGPK, and G proteins; however, some studies have shown that cardiotoxicity-related protein KCNJ3 (potassium inwardly-rectifying channel) is controlled by G proteins and the cardiac sodium/calcium exchanger and is said to be regulated by cAPK and cGPK [58, 59] . The result of ClusterONE indicated that the constructed network is consistent with existing studies and that the network can be used to screen essential proteins in the CytoNCA plugin.",

The CaMKII enzymes transmit calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) signals released inside the cell by regulating signal transduction pathways through phosphorylation. Ca 2+ first binds to the small regulatory protein CaM, and this Ca 2+ /CaM complex then binds to and activates the kinase, which then phosphorylates other proteins such as ryanodine receptor and sodium/calcium exchanger. Thus, these proteins are related to the cardiotoxicity induced by aconitine alkaloids [60] [61] [62] . The excessive activity of CaMKII has been observed in some structural heart disease and arrhythmias [63] , and past findings demonstrate neuroprotection in neuronal cultures treated with inhibitors of CaMKII immediately prior to excitotoxic activation of the CaMKII [64] . The acute cardiotoxicity of the aconitine alkaloids is possibly related to this target. Based on the analysis of the PPI network above, CaMKII was selected as the potential target for further molecular docking and dynamic simulation. The dock result of 2V7O is shown in Figure 8A . Compound 20 has the highest fit scores, so it was selected as the template for conformational analysis. The mechanisms of CaMKII activation and inactivation are shown in Figure 8B . Compound 20 affects the normal energy metabolism of the myocardial cell via binding in the ATP-competitive site in Figure 8C . The inactive state of the CaMKII was regulated by CASK-mediated T306/T307 phosphorylation, and this state can be inhibited by the binding of Compound 20 in the ATP-competitive site. Such binding moves CaMKII toward a Ca 2+ /CaM-dependent activation active state and a Ca 2+ /CaM-dependent activation through structural rearrangement of the inhibitory helix caused by Ca 2+ /CaM binding and the subsequent autophosphorylation of T287 [65] , which will induce the excessive activity of CaMKII and dynamic imbalance of the calcium ions in the myocardial cell, eventually leading to heart disease and arrhythmias.",

As has been reported in the past [66] , the binding pocket of a protein receptor to a ligand is usually defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom within a distance of 5 \u00c5 from a heavy atom of the ligand. Such a criterion was originally used to define the binding pocket of ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a complex [20] , which was later proved to be very useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments. A similar approach has also been used to define the binding pockets of many other receptor-ligand interactions important for drug design [30, 31, 33, [67] [68] [69] [70] . The information of a binding pocket of CaMKII for the aconitine alkaloids will serve as a guideline for designing drugs with similar scaffolds, particularly for conducting mutagenesis studies.",

The CoMFA and CoMSIA have been utilized to generate a 3D-QSTR model [81] . All molecule models and the generation of 3D-QSTR were performed with SYBYL X2.0. Alkaloids in mice with LD 50 values listed in Table 4 were extracted from recent literature [70] . The LD 50 values of all aconitine alkaloids were converted into pLD 50 with a standard TRIPOS force field. These pLD50 values were used as a dependent variable, while CoMFA and CoMSIA descriptors were used as an independent variable. The SKETCH function of Sybyl X2.0 was utilized to illustrate structure and charges, and was calculated by the Gasteiger-Huckel method. Additionally, the tripose force field was utilized for energy minimization of these aconitine alkaloid molecules [81] . The 31 molecules were divided into a ratio of 3:1. The division was done in a way that showed that both datasets are balanced and consist of both active and less active molecules [81] . The reliability of the 3D-QSTR model depends on the database molecular alignment.

During the MD simulation, minimization and equilibration of original and docked proteins occurred in a 15 \u00c53 size water box. A CHARMM 22 force field file was applied for energy minimization and equilibration with Gasteiger-Huckel charges using Boltzmann initial velocity [93, 94] . Integrator parameters also included 2 fs/step for all rigid bonds and nonbonded frequencies were selected for 1 \u00c5 and full electrostatic evaluations for 2 \u00c5 were used with 10 steps for each cycle [93] . The particle mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions of the simulation system periodic boundary conditions with grid dimensions of 1.0 \u00c5 [94] . The pressure was maintained at 101.325 kPa using the Langevin piston and the temperature was controlled at 310 K using Langevin dynamics. Covalent interactions between hydrogen and heavy atoms were constrained using the SHAKE/RATTLE algorithm. Finally, 5 ns MD simulations for original and docked protein were carried out for comparing and verifying the binding affinity and stability of the ligand-receptor complex.",

The 3D-QSTR was built in Sybyl with internal robustness and external high prediction, enabling identification of pivotal molecule moieties related to toxicity in aconitine alkaloids. The CoMFA model had q 2 , r 2 , optimum component, and correlation coefficient (r 2 ) values of 0.624, 0.966, 6, and 0. 9698, respectively, and the CoMSIA model had q 2 , r 2 , optimum component, and correlation coefficient (r 2 ) values of 0.719, 0.901, 4, and 0.9770. The network was built with Cytoscape software and the STRING database, which demonstrated the reliability of cluster analysis. The 2V7O and 2VZ6 proteins were identified as potential targets with the CytoNCA plugin with PharmMapper server for interactions between the aconitine alkaloids and key amino acids in the dock study. The result of the dock study demonstrates the consistency of the experimental pLD 50 . The MD simulation indicated that aconitine alkaloids exhibit potent binding affinity and stability to the receptor CAMK2G. Finally, we incorporate pivotal molecule moieties and ligand-receptor interactions to realize the QSTR of aconitine alkaloids. This research serves as a guideline for studies of toxicity, including neuro-, reproductive, and embryo-toxicity. With a deep understanding of the relationship between toxicity and structure of aconitine alkaloids, subsequent structural modification of aconitine alkaloids can be carried out to enhance their efficacy and to reduce their toxic side effects. Based on such research, aconitine alkaloids can bring us closer to medical and clinical applications. In addition, as pointed out in past research [95] , user-friendly and publicly accessible web servers represent the future direction of reporting various important computational analyses and findings [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] . They have significantly enhanced the impacts of computational biology on medical science [110, 111] . The research in this paper will serve as a foundation for constructing web servers for QSTR studies and target identifications of compounds.",
