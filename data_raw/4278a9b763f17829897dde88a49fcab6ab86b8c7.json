            "text": "Legumain-based DNA vaccines have potential to protect against breast cancer. However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH,2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer's patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control. Oral vaccination was performed in the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model. Our data indicate that tumor volume was significantly smaller in groups using A.C.NPs or attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as carriers. Furthermore, splenocytes co-cultured them with 4T1 cells prestimulated with CoCl 2 , which influenced the translocation of legumain from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, showed a 4.7 and 2.3 folds increase in active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3 + /CD8 + /CD25 + ) when treated with A.C.NPs carriers compared with PBS C.NPs. Our study suggests that C.NPs coated with alginic acid may be a safe and efficient tool for oral delivery of a DNA vaccine. Moreover, a legumain DNA vaccine delivered orally with A.C.NPs can effectively improve autoimmune response and protect against breast cancer in mice.

            "text": "DNA-based vaccines provide protection against cancers in a variety of animal models [1, 2, 3, 4] . Upon vaccination, host autoimmunity is activated, resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth and metastasis [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Although conventional cancer DNA vaccines are designed to target tumor cells, more novel vaccines are being developed to target the specific contents in the tumor microenvironment [1, 6, 10, 11] . Legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase, is significantly overexpressed on tumor-associated macrophages [6, 12] . Moreover, DNA vaccines targeting legumain and delivered by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium exhibited efficiency in improving both the survival time of tumor-bearing mice and reducing tumor growth [1, 13] . Given the promising results from previous animal experiments, it may be that a legumain DNA vaccine could be used to treat cancer in the humans. However, there are several issues preventing the clinical application of this potentially powerful therapeutic strategy. One significant obstacle is the lack of a suitable carrier [14] .",

            "text": "Oral vaccination has advantages over intravenous administration, as it is noninvasive, more convenient, and achieves better clinical compliance [15] . In terms of biological carriers, both viral vectors and bacteria are used for oral DNA vaccination [16, 17] . Bacteria-based delivery systems have been shown to be more effective in priming immune responses, able to be loaded with larger amounts of DNA clones, and more easily controlled compared with viral vectors [13] . Nonetheless, safety remains an issue when applying them to the humans. Hence, studies have been carried out to develop novel delivery carriers with low toxicity and high efficiency. In the past decade, chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs) have emerged as novel carrier candidate because of their excellent stability, capacity to enhance mucosa absorption, and good compatibility with vaccine DNA [18, 19] . As a natural biopolymer derived from crustacean shells, C.NPs possess ideal properties of polymeric carriers; they are biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and inexpensive [20, 21] . Studies show that C.NPs less than 500 nm in diameter are transported through the intestinal mucosa via an endocytotic mechanism [18, 19, 20] . Moreover, improved mucoadhesion and transient opening of tight junctions in the mucosal cell membrane contribute to the absorption-promoting effect of chitosan. By incorporating DNA plasmids into C.NP systems, oral DNA vaccines can be delivered to major targets, the Peyer's patches, and be taken up by antigen-presenting cells [18, 20, 22, 23, 24] .",

As a result, the biocompatible and biodegradable features of chitosan nanoparticles have gained more attention as a carrier for oral DNA vaccination [34] . Although many efforts have been put into the design and modification of chitosan nanoparticles, a viable oral delivery system for DNA vaccines is still lacking [33] . One major obstacle to achieving satisfactory oral vaccinations in the DNA degradation results when exposed to the acidic gastric environment and the subsequent decreased uptake via lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract [35, 36, 37] . We demonstrated here, that compared with plain chitosan nanoparticles, A.C.NPs protect DNA against degradation in stimulated gastric fluid (pH 1.5). At pH 7.0, alginic acid forms amide bonds with DNA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles by reaction of alginic acid carboxyl groups with chitosan amino groups. Interestingly, after modification with alginic acid, DNAloaded chitosan nanoparticles demonstrate a distinct trend as pH values increase. A.C.NPs tend to aggregate into micrometerscale complexes at pH 1.5, whereas they disperse into smaller particles as pH increases. This difference might be attributed to the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the acidic condition and the subsequent decomposition of the cross-linked structure between the carboxyl groups of alginic acid and amino groups of chitosan. Excess alginic acid is insoluble at pH 1.5 and potentially forms an amorphous shell on the nanoparticle surface; protecting DNA against enzymatic and acidic degradation (Fig. 9A ). Uptake and expression by antigen-presenting cells in Peyer's patches is a critical step toward successful oral DNA vaccination [18, 20] . We visualized the expression of DNA plasmids when loaded in diverse delivery carriers using enhanced green fluorescence protein DNA plasmids. Our results suggest that after leaving the acidic gastric environment and entering the intestines, DNA loaded in A.C.NPs are effectively taken up and expressed by the Peyer's patches. Expression of EGFP was predominately located in macrophages and dendritic cells. It appears as though modification with alginic acid largely increased the amount of EGFP expression in Peyer's patches after oral administration (illustrated schematically, Fig. 9B ). The absorption promoting effect of C.NPs has been extensively studied. Chitosan has been shown to exhibit increased mucoadhesion due to electrostatic interaction, as well as influence the transient opening of tight junctions; both of which may promote the transportation of a loaded DNA vaccine across the mucosal barrier [38] . In addition, studies also indicated that chitosan uptake increases the accumulation and activation of macrophages, providing an extra advantage in improving vaccination efficiency.",

We utilize a full-length legumain DNA vaccine and the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model to evaluate effectiveness as an oral carrier. Our data demonstrate that legumain DNA vaccine carried with A.C.NPs exhibits a similar, if not better, effect on suppressing tumor growth and prolonging survival of tumorburdened animals compared with both attenuated S. typhi-based vaccine and vaccine carried by C.NPs. Luo et al. have already reported that legumain is specifically expressed by tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment [6] . Autoimmunity established via vaccination with a legumain DNA vaccine destroys TAMs and remodels the immunosuppressive milieu that benefits tumor development. Recent studies reveal that legumain overexpression is detected in the tumor cells themselves in some tumor models. Given this, it may be the autoimmunity targeting legumain would have a dual effect. It may help remodel the microenviroment that supports tumor survival; while at the same time act to deplete tumor cell populations directly. Interestingly, oral vaccination with legumain DNA increases the amount of activated CTLs (CD8 + CD25 + ) targeting legumain. Moreover, particles with alginic acid inhibit the activated regulatory T cells (CD4 + CD25 + ) aimed at legumain (Fig. S2 ). This might explain the longer survival time of mice vaccinated with A.C.NPs compared with those receiving a S. typhibased vaccine.",

            "text": "In summary, we utilized A.C.NPs as a delivery carrier for an oral DNA vaccine and evaluated their morphological and physical characteristics. We identified their degradation properties in simulated gastric conditions, as well as the protective effect on prolonging survival time and tumor growth suppression in the orthotopic breast cancer model. Although numerous issues need to be addressed before practical application of oral DNA vaccine can occur, our study may provide insight into a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment and has moved a step toward its potential clinical application. Figure S1 Oral administrated A.C.NPs are taken up by F4/80 positive cells in Peyer's patches. Naked EGFP DNA plasmid, C.NPs-EGFP and A.C.NPs-EGFP were separately given to BALB/c mice via intragastric administration at a daily dose of 30 mg plasmid DNA per mouse for three consecutive days. Peyer's patches in small intestines were fixed and prepared into 5-mmthick slides. Antibody of F4/80 was used to perform the immunofluorescence staining. Representative images indicated that, in Peyer's patches, the scope of EGFP expression (green) was significantly stronger in A.C.NPs-EGFP group comparing with naked EGFP DNA plasmid or C.NPs-EGFP group. Moreover, overlay of EGFP (green) and F4/80 positive cells (red) is detected in mice treated with A.C.NPs-EGFP. Scale bar = 50 mm. (TIF) Figure S2 Oral vaccination via A.C.NPs-legumain significantly inhibited regulatory T cells. Animals were grouped and treated as described. Upon sacrifice, splenocytes were isolated (n = 5) and cocultured with 4T1 cells pretreated with CoCl 2 for 24 h. The percentage of regulatory T cell was measured via flow cytometry. ",
