            "text": "Despite the wide use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, the first virus naturally infecting this organism was not discovered until six years ago. The Orsay virus and its related nematode viruses have a positive-sense RNA genome, encoding three proteins: CP, RdRP, and a novel \u03b4 protein that shares no homology with any other proteins. \u03b4 can be expressed either as a free \u03b4 or a CP-\u03b4 fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift, but the structure and function of both \u03b4 and CP-\u03b4 remain unknown. Using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, computational and biophysical analyses, here we show that the Orsay \u03b4 protein forms a~420-\u00c5 long, pentameric fiber with an N-terminal \u03b1-helical bundle, a \u03b2-stranded filament in the middle, and a C-terminal head domain. The pentameric nature of the \u03b4 fiber has been independently confirmed by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Recombinant Orsay capsid containing CP-\u03b4 shows protruding long fibers with globular heads at the distal end. Mutant viruses with disrupted CP-\u03b4 fibers were generated by organism-based reverse genetics. These viruses were found to be either non-viable or with poor infectivity according to phenotypic and qRT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, addition of purified \u03b4 proteins to worm culture greatly reduced Orsay infectivity in a sequence-specific manner. Based on the structure resemblance between the Orsay CP-\u03b4 fiber and the fibers from reovirus and adenovirus, we propose that CP-\u03b4 functions as a cell attachment protein to mediate Orsay entry into worm intestine cells.",

It was recently demonstrated that during infection \u03b4 could be expressed as a CP-\u03b4 fusion protein, which is likely generated by ribosomal frameshifting at the end of the CP ORF [7] . The RNA structure motif mediating the ribosomal frameshifting is conserved in all three nematode-infecting viruses [7] . The CP-\u03b4 fusion protein was detected in both infected worms and purified virion samples [7] , but the expression of free \u03b4 has yet to be confirmed. Primary sequence alignment of the Orsay \u03b4 to those from Santeuil and Le Blanc gives 37% and 39% overall identity, respectively, suggesting an overall conserved structure and function.",

            "text": "To better define the functional role of the Orsay \u03b4 and CP-\u03b4 during infection, here we report the structure of these two proteins using both X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM). Our results show that recombinant \u03b4 forms a fibrous molecule with a C-terminal globular domain. The N-terminal region of \u03b4 forms a pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle, but the rest of the protein is most likely \u03b2-stranded as suggested by sequence analysis and CD spectroscopy. The pentameric nature of the full-length \u03b4 fiber has been independently verified by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Coexpressing CP and CP-\u03b4 in insect cells produced Orsay VLPs with an enhanced amount of CP-\u03b4 compared to native virions. These VLPs were found to have multiple long fibers protruding from the capsid surface when observed under EM, indicating that the \u03b4 sequence adopts the same fibrous structure in both CP-\u03b4 and free \u03b4. Considering its five-fold symmetry, the CP-\u03b4 fibers are expected to occupy five-fold vertices in the capsid. Furthermore, reverse genetics confirmed that the structural integrity of CP-\u03b4 is essential for Orsay infection, and competition assays showed that purified \u03b4 proteins, when added in trans, effectively inhibit Orsay infection. By analogy with other viral capsid-associated fiber proteins, the Orsay CP-\u03b4 likely functions in cell entry as a cell receptor binding protein.",

            "text": "To characterize the structure and functions of Orsay \u03b4/CP-\u03b4, the \u03b4 ORF was cloned into a pET vector for overexpression in E. coli. A 6\u00d7His SUMO tag was added at the N-terminus of the full-length \u03b4 to facilitate protein purification ( Fig 1A) . Recombinant \u03b4 was expressed as a soluble protein and~60% could be recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction. When subjected to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column, \u03b4 produced a sharp peak at~58 ml, corresponding to an apparent molecular size of~670 kDa, which is substantially higher than the calculated molecular mass of a monomer (i.e. 38.4 kDa) (S1 Fig). Negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was then performed to examine the molecular organization of \u03b4. Surprisingly, TEM images showed that \u03b4 forms fibrous molecules of extended length (Fig 1B) , thus explaining its unusual elution profile from the size exclusion column. Based on the measurement of 136 molecules, the length of the \u03b4 fibers was determined to be~419\u00b152-\u00c5 (Figs 1B and 2C). Close examination of individual \u03b4 molecules reveals several fine structural details: (1) at one end there is a globular head domain with a diameter of~50-\u00c5; (2) a second globule, which is slightly smaller, is found at roughly two-fifths of its length; (3) the thickness of the fiber is only~20-\u00c5 in most parts; and (4) the other end of the fiber opposite to the large head domain often appears to be slightly enlarged in diameter (Fig 1B) . There was no particular bending point observed along the fiber, but the fibrous region near the globular head often exhibited more pronounced curvatures. Other than the~420-\u00c5 \u03b4 fibers, longer or thicker filaments were not observed in EM, suggesting that further oligomerization of the \u03b4 fiber did not occur.",

The N-terminal 65 residues were predicted to form an \u03b1-helical structure, whereas the rest of \u03b4 was predicted to be primarily \u03b2stranded. The online server Motif Scan [31] also detected a valine-rich region in the middle of the Orsay \u03b4 sequence that is known to form regular arrays of \u03b2-strands in a number of exo/ cytoskeleton-related proteins including putative insect cuticle proteins and a putative adhesin in Parabacteroides distasonis (PDB ID: 3LJY). Circular dichroism (CD) was measured to experimentally determine the secondary structure content of \u03b4 ( Fig 1C) . The CD spectra indeed showed a single trough near 220nm, which is highly characteristic for \u03b2-stranded structures, consistent with the results from secondary structure prediction. A quantitative analysis of the CD spectra was done using the program BeStSel [32] , which estimated that \u03b4 is composed of 3.3% \u03b1-helices and 42.6% \u03b2-strands ( Fig 1C) .",

To test this hypothesis, a number of \u03b4 truncates were designed with progressively larger amounts of N-and C-terminal sequences removed. While the N-terminally truncated mutants, including \u03b4(167-346), \u03b4(195-346), \u03b4(220-346), \u03b4(241-346) and \u03b4 (256-346), were poorly soluble, all C-terminally truncated mutants behaved similarly to the CP-\u03b4, which is produced by ribosomal frameshifting, is comprised of the full-length CP, a 29-aa linker, and the full-length \u03b4. The Orsay CP can be divided into three parts, the N-terminal peptide, shell, and the spike domain. The five \u03b4 and CP-\u03b4 truncation mutants are shown below. (b) TEM images of \u03b4 by negative staining. On the right are five enlarged \u03b4 aligned in the horizontal direction. Scale bar, 500 \u00c5. (c) CD spectra of \u03b4. The experimental data and the fitting curves are shown in red and blue, respectively. The table below compares the secondary structure contents calculated from CD and sequence-based prediction. (d) \u03b4 domain map. There is a slightly enlarged tail domain at the N-terminus (aa1-66), a small globular domain in the middle, and a large globular head at the C-terminus. full-length \u03b4 during purification and were eluted as a major peak from the gel filtration column (Fig 1A and S1 Fig) . TEM further confirmed that both \u03b4(1-162) and \u03b4(1-241) formed fibrous molecules, however, their lengths were shorter than the full-length protein, with \u03b4(1-162) and \u03b4(1-241) fibers measured to be 215\u00b130-\u00c5 (n = 96) and 359\u00b132-\u00c5 (n = 35) long, respectively (Fig 2B and 2C) . Considering that the full-length \u03b4 protein is~420-\u00c5 long, the length of these two mutants is roughly proportional to the size of their respective sequence. The large globular head domain was absent from both \u03b4(1-162) and \u03b4(1-241), indicating that the head domain is formed by the C-terminal sequence. Overall, our results suggest that the \u03b4 protein fiber is a parallel oligomer with a C-terminal head domain, because these two \u03b4 protein truncates formed fibrous molecules resembling the left end of the \u03b4 protein fiber (Fig 1D) .",

However, the Orsay CP-\u03b4 was found to be insoluble when expressed in either E. coli or insect cells. Because Orsay CP has a strong tendency to assemble into VLPs [23] , the most likely explanation for the solubility problem is that the different oligomerization behaviors of the CP component (i.e. dimer, trimer, pentamer, and hexamer) and the \u03b4 component (i.e. pentamer-see below) of the fusion protein resulted in an infinite molecular network and thus the formation of large aggregates.",

Each \u03b4(1-66) molecule folds into two \u03b1-helices that are connected by a 9-aa linker (i.e. residues 21 to 29) ( Fig 3C) . The longer \u03b1-helix, consisting of residues 30 to 63, has a kink at around residue 40 ( Fig 3A) . The helix after the kink contains three regular heptad repeats (i.e. 40 VSDKLDKI-SESLNTLVECVID 60 , in which hydrophobic residues are highlighted in bold). Heptad repeats are frequently observed in coiled coil structures (i.e. dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric and pentameric) and they contain amino acid sequences arranged in the periodicity of (a b c d e f g), with positions a and d predominantly occupied by hydrophobic residues. Hydrophobic side chains at the positions a and d make up a continuous hydrophobic surface on the \u03b1-helix so that multiple \u03b1-helices can wrap around each other to form a stable helical bundle [34, 35] . Surface representation of the \u03b4(1-66) pentamer shows a~3 to 5-\u00c5 wide channel running through the entire molecule.

Therefore, the core of the entire helical bundle is mostly hydrophobic, except for a single location at T14.

Under even relatively energetic conditions a mass consistent with a homo-pentamer (192214.8 \u00b11 Da) was the only major mass observed ( Fig 4A) . This compares favorably to the average mass according to the sum of the relative atomic masses of 192210 Da and to the extremes of isotopic composition of 192187.4 and 192226.5 Da, as reported by IUPAC (2013 revision). It is important to note that neither the monomeric species, nor any other multimeric species, was observed even under the relatively energetic conditions shown (and all conditions tried). This indicates that the homo-pentamer is exceptionally stable. Under sufficiently energetic conditions, the gas phase pentameric complex will dissociate upon collision with buffer gas to produce exclusively monomers. revision). Thus, the direct observation of pentamers and their dissociation to exclusive monomers upon sufficient activation energy confirm that the original complex is a homo-pentamer of high stability. The absence of alternate stoichiometries, either prior to dissociation or as a product or intermediate of the dissociation process, further supports the pentamer as the likely near exclusive stoichiometry.",

The use of two baculoviruses would allow the control of the relative amount of CP and CP-\u03b4 to optimize particle assembly. Recombinant VLPs were purified by Ni-NTA affinity as both CP and CP-\u03b4 contained a C-terminal His-tag. Under negative-staining EM, we observed many spherically shaped particles associated with long fibers (Fig 5A) . The diameter of these particles is around 350-\u00c5, closely matching that of the Orsay viron or VLP [2, 23] . The length of particle-associated fibers, when measured from the surface of the capsid, is 387\u00b142-\u00c5 (n = 23), which is similar to the length of free \u03b4 measured at 419\u00b152-\u00c5 ( Fig 5B) . Some of the fibers even show a head domain at their distal end, consistent with our assumption that the N-terminal coiled coil of the \u03b4 fiber is directly attached to the CP surface spike. Considering the 5-fold symmetry of the \u03b4 protein, in principle there can be up to 12 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fibers in each capsid, with one occupying each icosahedral vertex ( Fig 5D) . Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of our capsid sample showed the mass ratio of CP-\u03b4 to CP is around 1:2 (Fig 5C) , which corresponds to roughly 1:4 in molar ratio, suggesting that on average there should be~7 pentameric fibers in each particle. The most fibers we observed in a single VLP were seven. It is Structures of the Orsay virus \u03b4 and CP-\u03b4 fusion proteins possible that some fibers were not visible due to staining artifacts, or that not all CP-\u03b4 was properly incorporated into capsids.",

The crystal structure of the Orsay capsid shows that the C-terminus of the Orsay CP is tucked underneath of a tightly bound trimeric spike [23] (S8 Fig) . Therefore, for a trimeric fiber to form, the polypeptide sequence would have to go around the timeric spike from outside, spanning a distance of at least 60-\u00c5 in order to reach the 3-fold axis. By comparison, the C-terminus of the CP points toward a depression around the 5-fold symmetry axis, with only a 25-\u00c5 traveling distance to the 5-fold, thus facilitating the formation of pentameric fibers. Our results from mass spectrometry also indicate that the pentameric \u03b4 fiber is very stable and does not dissociate unless under high energetic conditions, suggesting that it is unlikely for the \u03b4 sequence to adopt an alternative trimeric configuration in the form of the CP-\u03b4 fusion protein.",

The globular head of CP-\u03b4 likely hosts the cell receptor binding site as it does in reovirus and adenovirus. The binding of CP-\u03b4 to the host receptor should allow virus attachment to the host intestinal cells for the subsequent cell entry. The cell receptor molecule for Orsay has yet to be determined, but we expect that viral particles containing only CP but no CP-\u03b4 fibers would be non-infectious due to blocked cell entry. It is unclear whether having only 1 to 2 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fiber instead of a full complement of 12 would negatively impact Orsay's infectivity, but dsDNA bacteriophages such as \u03d529 are highly infectious with only one tail structure in each viral particle [52, 53] . For the bacteriophage T4, it was demonstrated that three fibers per virion are sufficient for infectivity, and reducing the lipopolysaccharide receptor concentration on cell surface has the same effect as tail fiber limitation on phage infectivity [54] . Therefore, it is possible that not all 12 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fiber are needed for Orsay, especially if abundant receptor molecules exist on the C. elegans intestinal cell surface.",

Both of our infectivity assays in Fig 6, one based on the body transparency of infected animals and the other measuring viral RNA in worm lysates, relied on one infection cycle and therefore mainly detected mutant defects in viral entry. Mutant defects downstream from viral RNA replication cannot be effectively measured using these assays. It remains possible that the free \u03b4 protein may interact with the host machinery to promote virus assembly and/or mediate the release of viral particles from the apical side of the worm intestine cells. Furthermore, many non-enveloped animal viruses are known to encode a lytic peptide or protein, but such function has not yet been reported for Orsay. Free \u03b4 may function as a lytic protein.

The intact complex was best observed with MS2 ETD 0.1 ms reaction time, Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window and 15,000 resolution in an Orbitrap analyzer. Note that these conditions produce effective intact protein complex observation and do not result in substantial dissociation of the non-covalent complex or fragmentation of covalent peptide bonds. For the dissociation of the pentameric complex and observation of the intact monomer, the following conditions were used: MS2 with HCD 12% energy, 70V Source Fragmentation, 60000 Resolution Orbitrap with Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window in high mass range, 47 scans. Complex dissociation was efficiently achieved with HCD of 9% collision energy and complete complex dissociation was observed around 12%-13% HCD collision energy. CID required much higher energies: up to 90% to see similar complex dissociation. Note the relatively high collisional energies used to achieved dissociation of the pentamer, with essentially no cleavage of covalent bonds. Orbitrap high resolution analysis (500,000 resolving power setting) allows isotopic separation of the monomer with both HCD and CID fragmentation; however, isotopic resolution of the intact 192kDa was not possible, nor expected. For isotopic resolution of the monomer the following conditions were used: MS2 with CID 50% Collision energy, 70V Source Fragmentation, 500,000 resolving power setting on the Orbitrap with Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window in high mass range mode.",

All data were analyzed with UltraScan-III ver. 3.5, release 2174 (http://www.ultrascan3.uthscsa.edu). All samples were measured in a 50 mM TRIS buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mM NaCl. Hydrodynamic corrections for buffer density and viscosity were estimated by UltraScan to be 1.010 g/ml and 1.036 cP. The partial specific volume of the delta protein (0.7399 ml/g) was estimated by UltraScan from protein sequence analogous to methods outlined in Laue et al [60] . SV data were analyzed according to the approach described in [61] . Optimization was performed by 2-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) [62] with simultaneous removal of time-and radially-invariant noise contributions [63] and meniscus fitting. After noise subtraction and meniscus fitting, the data were analyzed by the 2DSA Monte Carlo analysis to identify particle distributions in the frictional ratio-sedimentation coefficient domain [64] . The distribution suggested that a decreasing sigmoid parameterization is suitable for fitting the data with the parametrically constrained spectrum analysis (PCSA-DS), using Tikhonov regularization [65] . The calculations are computationally intensive and are carried out on high-performance computing platforms [66] . All calculations were performed on the Lonestar cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin and on Comet and Gordon at San Diego Supercomputing Center. The resulting fit produced random residuals and is shown in S5 Fig in the Generation of transgenic C. elegans for Orsay reverse genetics",

Synchronized L1 na\u00efve worms were obtained by bleaching [68] . 150 L1 worms and 200 \u03bcl of viral filtrate were added to each well of a 6-well RNAi plate.

RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using the RETRO script Kit (Ambion). qRT-PCR was performed using PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences), with the primers GW194, GW195 for viral RNA1 fragment and AMA-1F, AMA-1R for the internal reference gene ama-1 [2] . The viral product was first normalized to ama-1, and then normalized to the values of the wild-type recombinant virus. Three technical replicates were performed for qRT-PCR, and their average was used as one data point for Fig 6D. Protein-competition assa\u1ef9 100 synchronized L1 na\u00efve worms were added to each well of a 96-well plate that contained 100 \u03bcl of S medium [68] with 1mM IPTG, 50 ng/\u03bcl Carbenicillin, rde-1 RNAi bacteria, Orsay virus, and 2\u03bcg/ml Capsid, 2\u03bcg/ml \u03b4, or 0.57 \u03bcg/ml N-terminus \u03b4 fragment \u03b4(1-101). Theses protein concentrations were used so that the molar concentrations of the three proteins were similar. To determine the virus concentration, 2-fold serial dilution of viral filtration was conducted to determine a titration curve. The lowest viral concentration that can infect !70% plates was used for protein-competition. Animals were cultured on a 20\u02daC incubator shaker till they were day-3 adults. Animals were then transferred from each well to an unseeded NGM plate to count worms with the transparency symptom. A plate with over 50% transparent worms was scored as an infected plate. The percentage of infected plates was calculated to measure viral infectivity. Only one species of 38441.12032 Da monomer was observed. This confirms that the complex is composed of five equal mass proteins that form no other complex stoichiometry. Relatively high values of HCD and CID were required to effectively fragment the complex, suggesting that the complex is very stable. The theoretical mass was calculated with the average mass of each element obtained from IUPAC. Our calculated values are similar to those obtained from available mass calculators (ExPASy, Protein Calculator v3.4). Uncertainty is calculated from IUPAC values and propagated for the intact protein. (b) High resolution mass spectrometry confirms the charge state assignment of the intact monomer mass spectrum and further supports the determined mass. The isotopically resolved spectrum results in a calculation of the monomeric mass of 38440.12 for the most abundant isotope. Note that this differs slightly from an average mass, but further confirms the previously assigned mass. ",

The experimental mass of the intact complex is 192214.8 \u00b11 Da and is almost exactly the mass expected for a homo-pentamer. There is no indication in the mass spectrum of the existence of an alternative stoichiometry, including monomer. Note that due to the natural variance in isotopic composition the average mass of a protein complex of this size is inherently uncertain. The sum of the uncertainties of the relative atomic masses for this composition results in an estimate of the natural variation of approximately \u00b19Da, indicating that the observed difference of approximately 4 Da is well within the range expected. (b) Molar mass analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation. The integrated molar mass of the major peak is consistent with a pentameric species. Higher molecular weight species are also visible, but are present at lower concentration. Molecular species > 800,000 Da are not shown for clarity. Minor peaks may explained by modeling inaccuracies and/or contaminating proteins.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1006231.g004 Structures of the Orsay virus \u03b4 and CP-\u03b4 fusion proteins PLOS Pathogens | DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1006231 February 27, 2017",
