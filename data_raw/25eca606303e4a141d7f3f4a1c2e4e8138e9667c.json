It dose-dependently inhibited trypsin with an IC 50 value of 0.4 \u00b5M, and this activity was reduced in the presence of dithiothreitol in a dose-and time-dependent manner, signifying the importance of the disulfide linkage to the activity. It inhibited [methyl-3 H] thymidine incorporation by leukemia L1210 cells and lymphoma MBL2 cells with an IC 50 value of 2.3 \u00b5M and 2.5 \u00b5M, respectively. The inhibitor had no effect on fungal growth and the activities of various viral enzymes when tested up to 100 \u00b5M.",

GBTI exhibited a molecular mass of 17.5 kDa in both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration ( Figure 1 ).

            "text": "Upon ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, the bean extract was separated into three fractions of approximately equal size, an unadsorbed fraction D1 and two adsorbed fractions D2 and D3. Trypsin inhibitory activity was located in fraction D2. When fraction D2 was subjected to affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, the activity was recovered in the larger unadsorbed fraction B1 (data not shown). Upon ion exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose, fraction B1 was resolved into a small unadsorbed fraction S1 and two large adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) of approximately equal size. Activity resided in fraction S2. Further purification of S2 on Superdex 75 yielded two fractions, SU1 and SU2. Only fraction SU2 exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity. SU2 was the purified trypsin inhibitor (GBTI). The yields of the various chromatographic fractions are presented in Table 1 . The N-terminal sequence of the trypsin inhibitor is shown in Table 2 . GBTI exhibited a molecular mass of 17.5 kDa in both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration ( Figure 1 ). Its trypsin inhibitor activity remained unchanged in the temperature range 20-80 \u00b0C, was reduced by 60% at 90 \u00b0C, and, was totally abolished after exposure to 100 \u00b0C. Trypsin inhibitor-enriched fractions are highlighted in boldface. Results represent mean \u00b1 SD, n = 2. Trypsin inhibitor-enriched fractions are highlighted in boldface.

            "text": "The assay for HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity was carried out in view of the report that trypsin inhibitors manifest this activity [35, 36] . It was conducted according to instructions supplied with the assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim (Basel, Switzerland). The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been pre-coated with strepatavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase enzyme, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the protein was calculated as percent inhibition compared to a control without the protein [15] . The positive control used was kale antifungal peptide. The plasmid that expressed His-tagged wild-type HIV-1 integrase, pT7-7-His (Y|TX)-HIV-1-IN, was a generous gift from Professor S.A. Chow (School of Medicine, UCLA). To express the protein, a 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the expression plasmid was grown at 37 \u2022 C until OD600 reached 0.7-0.8. Cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and harvested, after 4 h of incubation, by centrifugation at 6000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C Cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.1 g/mL wet cell paste in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mM EDTA (Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid), 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. After incubation at 4 \u2022 C for 1 h, the lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 40,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C for 20 min. The pellet was homogenized in 50 mL buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) containing 5 mM imidazole. The suspension was rotated at 4 \u2022 C for 1 h, and cleared by centrifugation at 40,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-mL chelating Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) charged with 50 mM NiSO 4 and was equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with three column volumes of buffer A containing 200 and 400 mM imidazole, respectively. Protein containing fractions were pooled, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and then against buffer B containing 1 mM dithiothreitol.
