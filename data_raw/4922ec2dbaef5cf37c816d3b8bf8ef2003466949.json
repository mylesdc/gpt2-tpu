Participants were tested for Schistosoma japonicum infection in stool and seven standard measures of the liver and spleen were obtained using ultrasound to evaluate the relationship between schistosomiasis infection and ultrasound-detectable pathology, and the impact of targeted treatment on morbidity. Parenchymal fibrosis, a network pattern of the liver unique to S. japonicum, was associated with infection at the time of ultrasound (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03-1.90) and infection intensity (test for trend, p = 0.002), adjusting for age, sex and year, and more strongly associated with prior infection status and intensity (adjusted OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.30-2.60; test for trend: p,0.001 respectively), despite prompt treatment of infections. While declines in parenchymal fibrosis over time were statistically significant, only 28% of individuals with severe parenchymal fibrosis (grades 2 or 3) at enrollment reversed to normal or grade 1 within five years. Other liver abnormalities were less consistently associated with S. japonicum infection.",

The major intestinal schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum, found in Asia, and S. mansoni, found in Africa, the Americas and the Middle East, mature, mate and lay eggs in the portal and mesenteric blood vessels. Eggs are transported to the liver where they are encapsulated and the granulomas that form induce an inflammatory cascade that includes the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix proteins, a normal liver repair process that can lead to fibrosis when fibrogenesis exceeds the replacement of scar tissue with healthy cells [5, 6] . The immune regulation of this process is currently being explored [7] . Approximately 700,000 people are infected with S. japonicum in China [8] . As in other parts of the world, schistosomiasis control efforts have focused primarily on the distribution of the antischistosomal drug, praziquantel [9, 10] . However the success of such efforts hinges on the ability to reduce not only schistosomiasis infections, but also morbidity. A means of documenting S. japonicum morbidity is essential to the evaluation of disease control efforts [11] .",

            "text": "Ultrasound is a non-invasive method that can be used to evaluate fibrosis resulting from schistosomiasis infection. Fibrosis along the portal vein and its branches produces a clay pipestem pattern, as the portal tracks are lined with fibrous tissue, and is observed following both S. mansoni and S. japonicum infection. This periportal fibrosis can be assessed qualitatively through image classification [12] or quantitatively by measuring the diameter of three secondary portal branches [13] . Unique to S. japonicum infection is parenchymal fibrosis, a network pattern that is often described as fish scale or tortoise shell-like. Parenchymal fibrosis is likely due to the smaller S. japonicum egg size which allows the parasite eggs to enter smaller portal veins and reach a greater portion of the liver [7] . S. japonicum adult females produce ten times more eggs per day than S. mansoni, and the eggs often are deposited in clusters, two additional factors that exacerbate the severity of S. japonicum morbidity relative to other schistosome species and may contribute to the unique fibrotic pattern [3] . Ultrasound can also be used to assess hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and dilation of the portal vein, all of which result from portal hypertension. Recognizing the potential of ultrasound to be used to evaluate the impact of disease control efforts, draft protocols for the use of ultrasound in assessing schistosomiasis morbidity were established for each of the three major schistosome species in 1990 [13, 14] . Follow-up meetings to refine the protocols for S. haematobium and S. mansoni were held in 1996 and 1997 [15] . Ultrasound is considered the gold standard for schistosomiasis morbidity assessment for these species [11] . However, due to insufficient evidence the protocol for S. japonicum has not been revised.",

Li et al. [16, 17] offer the most complete examination of the proposed ultrasound measures to date, tracking a highly exposed cohort over five years, but as standard organ sizes have only recently been published [18] , assessments of liver and spleen enlargement did not account for participant height as currently recommended [15] . Failure to account for height-specific variation in organ sizes can lead to underestimates of morbidity, particularly in pediatric populations [19] . Ideally, ultrasound measures are associated with S. japonicum infection and decline following treatment [13] . The available data is conflicting on both criteria. Treatment led to declines in parenchymal and periportal fibrosis in a highly exposed Chinese cohort; however 68% of participants experienced no change in parenchymal fibrosis over a five-year period [16, 17] and other studies have not found significant declines in periportal fibrosis following S. japonicum treatment [20, 21] . Further, a direct relationship between infection and fibrosis or measures of portal hypertension has not been demonstrated consistently [16, 17, 22] .",

Schistosoma japonicum, found in Asia, causes disease by releasing eggs in the liver, leading to fibrosis, anemia, and, in children, impaired growth. Ultrasound can assess liver pathology from schistosomiasis; however more information is needed to evaluate the relevance of standard ultrasound measures. We followed 578 people for up to five years, testing for schistosomiasis infection and conducting ultrasound examinations to assess the relationship between infection and seven ultrasound measures and to evaluate the impact of treatment with anti-schistosomiasis chemotherapy (praziquantel) on morbidity. All infections were promptly treated. Fibrosis of the liver parenchyma, pathology unique to S. japonicum, was associated with schistosomiasis infection, and was most advanced in people with high worm burdens. Liver fibrosis declined significantly following treatment, but reversal of severe liver fibrosis was rare. Other ultrasound measures were not consistently related to schistosomiasis infection or treatment. These findings suggest parenchymal fibrosis can be used to measure morbidity attributable to S. japonicum and evaluate the impact of disease control efforts. Because reversal of severe fibrosis was limited, disease control efforts will be most effective if they can not only treat existing infections but also prevent new infections.",

For each hatch test, a stool sample weighing at least 30 g was suspended in aqueous solution, filtered using copper mesh to remove large particles (40-60 mesh) followed by nylon gauze (260 mesh) to concentrate schistosome eggs. This sediment was re-suspended with distilled water in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Flasks were examined for miracidia 30-60 minutes, 4 hours and 8 hours after suspension if temperatures were above 30 degrees Celsius, or at 6, 12 and 18 hours at lower ambient temperatures. In 2000, three miracidial hatch tests were conducted per person using stool samples from three distinct days. In 2002, due to logistical constraints, one miracidial hatch test was conducted per person; however the Kato-Katz protocol was identical both years. The Kato-Katz procedure involved the preparation of three 41.5 mg slides from one homogenized stool sample in 2000 and 2002. Infection intensity, in eggs per gram of stool (EPG), was calculated as the total number of S. japonicum eggs present on the slides divided by the total sample weight. Participants were classified as infected if at least one test was positive. Everyone testing positive for S. japonicum was provided praziquantel treatment by the county Anti-Schistosomiasis Control Station. In addition, praziquantel was administered to all residents in the study villages in 2003, as part of a nation-wide effort to control infectious diseases following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

Liver parenchymal fibrosis grade, an ordinal measure, was examined using ordinal logistic regression, a population averaged model using a sandwich type estimator for inference accounting for within-subject residual correlation [28] . Because ordinal logistic regression assumes the effect of a predictor on an outcome is constant for each stepwise increase in the outcome, the Brant test [29] was used to check that this parallel regression assumption was not violated. For all other liver and spleen measures and for predictors of S. japonicum infection status, generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression with exchangeable correlation was conducted [30] . The Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance was used which is robust to misspecification of the outcome distribution [31, 32] . The relationship between S. japonicum infection and ultrasounddetected abnormalities was first assessed by examining the impact of current infection status and, separately, infection intensity, on current ultrasound measures. Because infection intensity was highly right skewed, it was categorized into approximate quartiles among those who were infected. In order to examine the role of past infection on current morbidity, we also examined the relationship between infection status and intensity two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination and ultrasound-detected abnormalities (for example: 2000 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2002, and 2002 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2005). We hypothesized that age, sex and year of examination could modify the effect of infection on morbidity, so each model was run including all possible first-order interaction terms. The Wald test was used to test for significant interactions and if present, terms were removed from the model step-wise until only interaction terms significant at p-values ,0.05 remained. In the absence of effect modification, these same variables could confound the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected morbidity. While occupation, village and educational status were considered potential predictors of S. japonicum infection, they are unlikely to effect ultrasound morbidity independent of infection status. As they do not fit the definition of confounders [33] , they were not controlled for in models examining the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected abnormalities. The change in ultrasound-detected abnormalities over time was examined adjusting for age and sex.",

The strong associations between age and all liver measures highlight the importance of considering age as a potential confounder when examining the relationship between S. japonicum infection and morbidity and declines in morbidity over time. For example, the unadjusted prevalence of parenchymal fibrosis did not change over time, however as loss to follow-up was highest in younger populations which were least likely to have fibrosis, the age and sex adjusted prevalence did decline. Our findings shed light on the development of hepatic fibrosis following S. japonicum infection. The lack of reversal of grade 3 parenchymal fibrosis to grade 1 or normal and the association between past infection and current fibrosis suggest severe fibrosis may persist or even progress following treatment. Prior studies have also found minimal reversal of severe fibrosis following treatment [16, 39] and hepatic fibrosis has been documented in people living in areas where the parasite, and therefore exposure, was eliminated 20 years previously [40] . While treatment with praziquantel can reduce infection prevalence, intensity and fibrosis, this analysis provides further evidence that severe hepatic fibrosis may be unlikely to reverse quickly. Minimal declines in severe hepatic fibrosis associated with S. mansoni infection have also been detected [41] but other studies have noted complete reversal of severe morbidity [42] .",

While schistosome eggs are thought to disintegrate within weeks of granuloma formation [7] , it is possible, due to an inflammatory cascade, fibrogenesis continues over a longer time period. Collagen deposition has been shown to occur following treatment with praziquantel in S. japonicum infected mice, suggesting fibrosis may continue despite removal of adult worms [44] . In humans, progression of fibrosis has been observed following treatment and was not explained by reinfection [21, 45] . Alternatively, it is possible that the relationship between past infection and fibrosis is due to reinfection. Past infection predicted subsequent infection. However, if reinfection rather than past infection determined fibrosis, one would expect stronger relationships between current infection and fibrosis than between past infection and fibrosis, which was not observed. It is also possible that some individuals who were treated were not cured. A single dose of praziquantel cures 90% of S. japonicum infections [46] , suggesting 10% of those treated may continue to harbor adult worms and face continued egg production. In our work in this region, we have also found individuals who decline to take praziquantel even after a positive infection test. Non-compliance and treatment failure are realities of any chemotherapy-based control program, however the marked declines in infection prevalence, intensity and morbidity suggest the number of individuals who were not cured was limited.",

Participants were randomly sampled from a comprehensive cross-sectional survey in order to minimize selection bias. Loss to follow-up was greater among those without ultrasound-detectable morbidity, which suggests the prevalence of morbidity in 2002 and 2005 may be overestimated, and therefore the true declines in morbidity over time may be greater than observed. Retention was independent of infection status, minimizing bias in estimates of the impact of infection on pathology. No information was available on alcohol consumption or infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), two factors that can induce liver pathology and may exacerbate schistosomiasis morbidity. The parenchymal network pattern due to S. japonicum is distinct from the lesions produced by HBV, as HBV produces a finer, meshwork texture [47] , suggesting the observed prevalence of parenchymal fibrosis is specific to schistosomiasis. While HBV has been shown to hinder regression of periportal fibrosis following treatment of S. mansoni infections [41] , the extent to which HBV exacerbates morbidity due to S. japonicum remains unclear and warrants further study. Reductions in parenchymal fibrosis may be impaired by alcohol consumption, which in our study areas is confined almost exclusively to males [17] . Unless alcohol consumption or HBV impacts a person's probability of infection, they are unlikely to confound the relationships between infection and ultrasound-detected morbidity.",

Other ultrasound measures including hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were less clearly associated with infection. Our findings also suggest that some morbidity may not reverse within five years of treatment and may even progress despite treatment. Praziquantel has yielded remarkable declines in schistosomiasis morbidity in China and throughout the globe but reinfection following treatment is common as observed in this study population. S. japonicum infection, particularly high egg loads, may lead to fibrosis that is not rapidly reversed by treatment, underscoring the importance of measures to prevent new infections as well as treating current disease.",
