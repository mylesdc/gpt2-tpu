Immunoprophylaxis with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk for RSV-related hospitalizations, but its use is restricted to high-risk infants due to the high costs. In this study, we investigated if genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody to neonatal mice by chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 expressing the murine form of palivizumab (AdC7\u03b1RSV) can provide protection against RSV. Intranasal and intramuscular administration of AdC7\u03b1RSV to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-RSV IgG in the serum. However, only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-RSV IgG in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intranasal administration of AdC7\u03b1RSV provided protection against subsequent RSV challenge. Expression of the anti-RSV antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of AdC7\u03b1RSV to neonatal mice. Protection against RSV was confirmed at 6 weeks of age. These data suggest that neonatal genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody by AdC7\u03b1RSV can provide protection against RSV.",

Among all currently available viral vectors, adenovirus (Ad) is one of the most efficient gene delivery systems, but pre-existing immunity against common human serotypes, such as Ad5, is hampering its use in humans. Non-human primate-derived Ad, such as chimpanzee Ad serotype 7 (AdC7), are alternative vectors and are less likely to be affected by pre-existing immunity [10] [11] [12] . We have previously reported that anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies do not cross-neutralize AdC7, and that maternal immunization of mice with the AdC7 vector expressing RSV vaccine antigen can protect their pups against RSV infection [13] . Therefore, we adopted AdC7 as a gene transfer vector to deliver anti-RSV neutralizing antibody to infants, expecting a successful application in the presence of maternal anti-human Ad antibodies.",

We focused on passive immunization in this study, but the combination of AdC7-based passive immunization and AdC7-based active immunization can be an attractive strategy to provide complete protective immunity throughout the vulnerable period.

Prolonged expression was seen when the vectors were administered to neonatal mice, but we could not estimate the half-life of antibodies since a serial collection of neonatal serum was not feasible. Several explanations can be possible for the prolonged expression. The antibody may have had a longer half-life than in adult mice because of the unique immunological properties of neonatal mice. The efficiency of gene delivery may have been greater due to the higher susceptibility to Ad of neonatal lungs. Recently, the development of new anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies went toward prolongation of the serum half-life. The amino acid modification made it possible to extend the serum half-life of the antibody [28, 29] . Modifying the expression cassette on the AdC7 to deliver more efficient anti-RSV monoclonal antibody with extended half-life itself may enable further long-term protection against RSV.",
