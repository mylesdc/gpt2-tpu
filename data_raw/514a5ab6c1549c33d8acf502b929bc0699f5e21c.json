The potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections was underestimated until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, which showed that new, highly pathogenic coronaviruses could be introduced to humans, highlighting the importance of monitoring the circulating coronaviruses. The use of sensitive molecular methods has contributed to the differential diagnosis of viruses circulating in humans. Our study aim was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains circulating in Arkansas, their genetic variability and their association with reported influenza-like symptoms. We analyzed 200 nasal swab samples, collected by the Arkansas Department of Health in 2010, for influenza diagnosis. All samples were from patients showing acute respiratory symptoms while testing negative for influenza. Samples were pre-screened, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) multiprobe for coronavirus, and subjected to confirmatory pancoronavirus and/or strain-specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by sequence analysis.

The most frequent strain detected was HCoV-OC43-like followed by NL63-like; only one sample was positive for HCoV-229E and one for HCoV-HKU1. Feline-like CoV strains were detected in three samples, representing possible evidence of interspecies transmission or a new human strain. Seventeen percent of the coronavirus positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 2 and 3, and Rhinovirus. Thus, HCoV-OC43, NL63, HKU1 and new feline-like strains were circulating in Arkansas in 2010. HCoV was the sole respiratory virus detected in 16% of the patients who showed acute respiratory symptoms with negative diagnoses for influenza virus.",

However, the disease range can vary from common cold, croup, and bronchiolitis to pneumonia, with an array of possible etiological agents, such as parainfluenza, influenza, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus and coronavirus [1, 2] . Coronaviruses (CoV) are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, including respiratory and enteric illnesses, in humans and animals [3] . Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were identified as the cause of acute respiratory tract disease in the early 1960's [4] , but their correlation with mild respiratory tract infection outweighed the importance of severe forms of the infection [5] . The emergence of SARS-CoV in humans in 2003 increased scientific interest in CoVs and emphasized the ability of highly pathogenic CoVs, most importantly those of animal origin, to infect humans. Consequently the importance of monitoring circulating coronavirus strains in humans has been reemphasized with the emergence of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV in humans [6, 7] .",

Feline CoV, an Alphacoronavirus, infects wild and domestic cats causing mild enteritis. However, a lethal systemic disease known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is also associated with FCoV. Feline CoV is closely related to CCoV, TGEV and human coronavirus HCV-229E, especially the Feline aminopeptidase N, which can be used as a functional receptor by these viruses [13] .",

The second most prevalent strain detected was closely related to NL63, which has been related to acute respiratory symptoms, mainly in children and immunocompromised individuals [28, 29] . Previous studies (2007 and 2009) in the US on the prevalence of HCoV in respiratory tract infections of children reported different circulating strains by region. In the Rocky Mountain region, the predominant strains were NL63, OC43 and 229E, while in the Pacific Northwest, HKU1 was predominant [21, 30] . In this study, we surveyed both children and adults and demonstrated that OC43 and NL63 CoVs were the predominant strains. In another study, using samples from Rochester, NY, Nashville, TN and Cincinnati, OH, the findings were similar to our study, in which the OC43 was the most prevalent strain, followed by NL63 and HKU1, and 229E was the least prevalent [31] . Prill et al. [31] reported that OC43 tended to circulate from fall to winter and NL63 from winter to spring, while 229E was not detected in the first four years of the study and only one cluster of HKU1 during a single winter. In a study by Kuypers et al. [30] , HKU1 was more likely to occur from October to February and 229E from December to June. In a study by Domiguez et al. [21] , HKU1 was more likely to occur from February to May and 229E from February to June. Based on the distribution of HKU1 and 229E the studies of Kuypers et al. [30] and Dominguez et al. [21] , we should have been able to detect both strains if they had circulated with similar seasonality in Arkansas; however, only one case of 229E and one case of HKU1 were detected.",
