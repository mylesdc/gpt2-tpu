In the current study, the gp85 protein of ALV-J was expressed on the surface of L. plantarum with the surface-display motif, pgsA, by constructing a shuttle vector pMG36e:pgsA:gp85. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by western blotting and flow cytometry. Subsequently, Specific Pathogen Free Hy-Line Brown layer chickens were orally vaccinated with the recombinant L. plantarum and presented with high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) titers in bile and duodenal-mucosal fluid. After challenged with ALV-J of a 3 \u00d7 10 3 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), serum samples of the chickens were collected and viremia was analyzed. Results showed that, compared to the L. plantarum and PBS control group, the recombinant L. plantarum group showed a significant rise in antibody levels after inoculation, and provide improved protection against ALV-J according to viremia detection. These results indicate that oral immunization with the recombinant L. plantarum provided an effective means for eliciting protective immune response against early ALV-J infection.",

However, numerous cases of ALV-J infection and tumors in commercial layer chickens and broiler breeders have emerged in recent years (2) (3) (4) (5) . This resulted in serious economic losses to breeding farms, including growth retardation, high mortality, tumor production and cost for eradication. Therefore, here is an urgent need to take measures to protect chickens against ALV-J infection.",

Vertical transmission from broiler breeders to progeny is frequent with ALV-J (7); this is due to the current lack of an effective vaccine against ALV. Consequently, researchers have been trying to explore a vaccine that will increase the proportion of positive antibodies against ALV through incubating breeder flocks, thereby reducing the chance of infection from infected chickens and improving the resistance of chickens by increasing ALV maternal antibodies to later infection. However, the inactivated vaccine has no significant effect, because the antigenicity of the inactivated virus is commonly destroyed (8) . Furthermore, considering the complexity of ALV, the existing vaccine did not work well (9, 10) . The glycoprotein (gp) with Mr of 85,000 (gp85) is encoded by the envelope (env) gene of ALV, and that the gp85 protein forms globular structures on the surface of the virus, and is closely associated with viral neutralization which determines the antigenicity of ALV-J (11) . Previous researches have shown that the protein could be used as a vaccine to help ALV-J infect susceptible cells and induce the production of specific antibodies among infected chickens (12, 13) . Therefore, this study set out to search for a live vehicle that could carry the surface protein gene gp85 to prevent the ALV-J infection.",

However, in recent years, ALV-J has also occurred in commercial layer flocks (27) , and it has become a serious threat to local breeder flocks. For many pathogens, initial infection occurs in the mucosa of animals. Chickens with ALV-J can infect other healthy individuals via their excrements or cloacal secretions. Therefore, our study was devoted to seeking an effective vaccine that would protect chickens from ALV-J infection. Compared to routine styles of antigen delivery, mucosal immunization still offers some advantages including those of being more convenient, lower cost, and less stress (14, 15) . In addition, lactic acid bacteria have been proposed as a live vehicle for the delivery of exogenous antigen proteins for mucosal immunization or for other therapeutic molecules. The biological functions of lactic acid bacteria are effectively combined with the immunogenicity of exogenous antigen genes (19, 20, 28) . L. plantarum, a lactic acid bacteria, that can be used as a probiotic for animal gastrointestinal tracts, has many functions, such as maintenance of intestinal flora, enhancement of immunity, and promotion of nutrient absorption. L. plantarum can also act as a potential delivery vehicle for mucosal vaccines because it is generally regarded as safe and is able to protect antigens from premature disintegration and degradation in animal gastrointestinal tract (19, 20) .",

To this end, ALV-J gp85 protein was expressed on the surface of L. plantarum using the surface-display motif, pgsA, which was adopted from the poly-\u03b3-glutamic synthetase complex. By using this approach, we hoped to address the aforementioned challenges. In the present study, the results indicated that pgsA effectively displayed the gp85 protein on the surface of L. plantarum (Figures 3, 4) . L. plantarum as a carrier can successfully express exogenous antigens, resist damage from the extreme gastrointestinal environment, and significantly enhance the immunogenicity of pgsA-gp85 antigens.
