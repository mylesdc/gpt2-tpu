            "text": "The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has attracted public interest worldwide, leading to millions of Ebola-related Internet searches being performed during the period of the epidemic. This study aimed to evaluate and interpret Google search queries for terms related to the Ebola outbreak both at the global level and in all countries where primary cases of Ebola occurred. The study also endeavoured to look at the correlation between the number of overall and weekly web searches and the number of overall and weekly new cases of Ebola. Methods: Google Trends (GT) was used to explore Internet activity related to Ebola. The study period was from 29 December 2013 to 14 June 2015. Pearson's correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related relative search volumes (RSVs) with the number of weekly and overall Ebola cases. Multivariate regression was performed using Ebola-related RSV as a dependent variable, and the overall number of Ebola cases and the Human Development Index were used as predictor variables. Results: The greatest RSV was registered in the three West African countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. The queries varied in the different countries. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the affected African countries and other Western countries with primary cases were noted, in relation to the different flux volumes and different time courses. In the affected African countries, web query search volumes were mostly concentrated in the capital areas. However, in Western countries, web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory. In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between the number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index varied from weak to moderate. The correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all countries during the study period and the GT index was very high. Conclusion: Google Trends showed a coarse-grained nature, strongly correlating with global epidemiological data, but was weaker at country level, as it was prone to distortions induced by unbalanced media coverage and the digital divide. Global and local health agencies could usefully exploit GT data to identify disease-related information needs and plan proper communication strategies, particularly in the case of health-threatening events.",

Moreover, in recent years, the use of mobile phones has increased dramatically, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, igniting a revolution in Internet access [24] . It has been demonstrated that a strong positive correlation exists between the number of mobile phone subscribers and HDI, especially in African countries [25] .

In the UK and Italy, two further peaks were observed: in UK, a small peak (RSV = 25/100) was registered on 30 December 2014, corresponding to the news headline \"Ebola patient in Britain transferred to London\"; while in Italy a small peak (RSV = 17/100) was registered on the third week of April 2014, some days after the news of the first Ebola victims quarantined in Guinea. Figure 3 outlines the regional interest in the search term \"Ebola\" in each of the 10 countries affected by Ebola primary cases. In the affected African countries, with the exception of Nigeria (see Fig. 3e ), web query search volumes were concentrated in the capital areas, while no queries were reported in regions when the epidemic first spread. In Nigeria, the interest in Ebola was concentrated not only in the capital (Abuja), but also in other not neighbouring regions. However, in Western countries, the web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory (see Fig. 3 ).

In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between new weekly cases of Ebola reported in the WHO patient database and the weekly GT index varied from weak in Guinea (r = 0.232, p-value = 0.07) to moderate in Sierra Leone (r = 0.481, p-value <0.001) and Liberia (r = 0.640, p-value <0.001). When correlating with new weekly cases of Ebola reported in the WHO situation report, the correlation was weaker and not statistically significant in all cases.

We can speculate that this could have contributed to the failure in adopting proper preventive measures and favoured considerable misunderstanding about the risks of exposure to Ebola. From an epidemiological standpoint, the analysis of correlation between the number of Ebola cases and GT-based RSV demonstrated that using web search volume related to the single term \"Ebola\" for surveillance purposes may not be feasible. Regression analyses performed at a global level enabled us to separate the three mainly affected West African countries from the other countries in terms of web search behaviour (see Table 2 and Fig. 5 ). Further, our correlation results showed that Ebola-related RSV per country matched with the number of cases registered in that given country for the entire epidemic period, even though the degree of accuracy varied depending on (a) the country and (b) the considered timeline. When considering the number of weekly cases of Ebola, the correlation between RSVs and epidemiological data was weaker.",

Google Trends only captures the search behaviour of a certain segment of the populationthose with Internet access and those using Google rather than other search engines (although Google is the most common search engine). However, the major limitation of GT is the lack of detailed information on the method by which Google generates this search data and the algorithms it employs to analyse it. Google Trends data were available only in the form of relative volume and not as absolute values, enabling further data handling and manipulation. Furthermore, temporal changes in the interface and capabilities of GT over time are not documented, which may lead to variations in the search output and in turn the study findings. Thus, the interpretation of the findings may be affected depending on the time and geographical area of the GT data.",
