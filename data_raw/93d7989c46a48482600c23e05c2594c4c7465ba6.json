The mechanism through which the causative agent, rabies virus (RABV), evades the host immune response and infects the host central nervous system (CNS) has not been completely elucidated thus far. Our previous studies have shown that lab-attenuated, but not wild-type (wt), RABV activates the innate immune response in the mouse and dog models. In this present study, we demonstrate that lab-attenuated RABV causes abortive infection in astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS. Furthermore, we found that lab-attenuated RABV produces more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) than wt RABV, which is recognized by retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor molecule for RIG-I and MDA5, results in the production of type I interferon (IFN) and the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes, which suppress RABV replication and spread in astrocytes. Notably, lab-attenuated RABV replicates in a manner identical to that of wt RABV in MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes. It was also found that lab-attenuated, but not wt, RABV induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines via the MAVS-p38/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These inflammatory cytokines increase the blood-brain barrier permeability and thus enable immune cells and antibodies infiltrate the CNS parenchyma, resulting in RABV control and elimination. In contrast, wt RABV restricts dsRNA production and thus evades innate recognition by RIG-I/MDA5 in astrocytes, which could be one of the mechanisms by which wt RABV evades the host immune response in resident CNS cells. Our findings suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in limiting the replication of lab-attenuated RABV in the CNS.",

Our findings suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in limiting the replication of lab-attenuated RABV in the CNS. inTrODUcTiOn Rabies is an acute encephalomyelitis. The hallmark of rabies is that the disease is almost always fatal once clinical signs develop (1, 2) . The causative agent, rabies virus (RABV), is a negative-strand RNA virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae (3) . RABV enters neurons from the neuromuscular junction closest to the site of infection. After a short incubation, RABV travels to the central nervous system (CNS) through sensory or motor neurons. Only slight tissue damage and neuroinflammation can be observed in the brains of rabid patients (4) . In contrast, lab-attenuated RABV induces extensive inflammation and apoptosis, as well as increases in the expression levels of innate immunity-related genes in the CNS of infected mice (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . These findings suggest that wt, but not lab-attenuated, RABV evades the host immune responses. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against viral invasion. Viruses are usually confronted by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) like helicases (RLRs) (11) . TLR family members, such as TLR3 and TLR7, are generally involved in recognizing negative-strand RNA viruses (12) . TLR3 binds double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), whereas TLR7 recognizes single-strand RNA. The main sources of dsRNA in infections with single-strand RNA viruses are the replicative intermediates generated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (13) . TLR3 and TLR7 initiate signaling though the adaptor molecules TRIF and MyD88, respectively. Both signaling cascades triggered by these proteins lead to IRF3 phosphorylation in the C terminal region at serine 386, which is critical for IRF3 activation by two I\u03baB kinases (TBK-1 and IKK\u03b5) (14, 15) . Activated IRF3 homo-or hetero-dimerizes with IRF7 and then translocates into the nucleus, to interacts with the CREB binding protein CBP/p300 and stimulates the transcription of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, as well as some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (15, 16) . Alternatively, RNA viruses can be recognized by two RLRs, RIG-I, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), located in the cytoplasm (17, 18) . RIG-I solely senses short and blunt dsRNA of negative-strand RNA viruses containing 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA in the panhandle region of their single-stranded genome (17) . Unlike RIG-I, MDA5 preferentially binds blunt-ended dsRNA, with or without 5\u2032 triphosphate (18) . RIG-I and MDA5 signaling is mediated through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), which is also known as IPS1, VISA or Cardif (19) . Similar to TLR signaling, RLR signaling results in IRF3 activation and nuclear translocation (20) .",

Prehaud et al. found that TLR3 mRNA expression is upregulated following RABV infection in postmitotic human neurons (21) . Furthermore, enhanced TLR3 expression has also been observed in the cerebellar cortical tissues of rabies patients (22) . The observation that TLR3 is upregulated following infection suggests that TLR3 plays a role in the innate recognition of RABV. Faul et al. found that both RIG-I and MDA5 were responsible for inducing dendritic cell (DC) activation and type I IFN production upon RABV infection (23) . MAVS, the adaptor protein for both RIG-I and MDA5, is essential for inducing innate immune responses in DCs. In another study, Li et al. found that mice lacking TLR7 exhibited a phenotype associated with intermediate mortality rates between those of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and control mice, indicating that TLR7 may play an important role in controlling RABV infections. However, the role of TLR7 in RABV infection is not entirely understood (24) .",

            "text": "Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the CNS and constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB) along with endothelial cells and pericytes (25) . Astrocytes are generally involved in regulating the CNS microenvironment and also play roles in neuronal metabolic support, synaptic transmission, and neurotropism. Moreover, astrocytes participate in developing and maintaining the BBB and guiding neuronal migration during development. The roles of astrocytes in innate immunity and inflammation have been reported recently (26) . Astrocytes are the reservoir for many neuroinvasive viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), John Cunningham virus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Astrocytes have also been shown to play multiple roles in viral infections. Specifically, they can increase BBB permeability (31) by producing cytokines and degrading tight junction proteins (32) . Moreover, astrocytes have been shown to induce the innate immune response to produce IFN (33) . An early report showed that both wt and lab-attenuated RABV could successfully infect primary astrocytes in the early stages of RABV infection (34) . A recent study demonstrated that a RABV vaccine strain SAD-L16 caused an abortive infection in astrocytes, but the detailed mechanism was not revealed (35) . In this study, it was found that lab-attenuated RABV produces higher level of dsRNA than wt RABV, which is recognized by RIG-I/MDA5 and results in the activation of MAVS signaling pathway. Following MAVS activation, the production of ISG and inflammatory cytokines helps to clear the lab-attenuated RABV from the CNS. In contrast, wt RABV can maintain a persistent infection in astrocytes by evading the innate recognition.",

To investigate the role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of RABV, we isolated primary astrocytes and neurons from suckling mice and infected them with DRV or B2c. The growth kinetics of both viruses in astrocytes was assessed by virus titration and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The viral loads in the cell culture supernatants infected with B2c quickly reached peak at 1 d.p.i., and then gradually decreased until 15 d.p.i. In contrast, the virus titer of DRV was initially relatively low but subsequently increased steadily until the endpoint (Figure 2A) . To be noted, the viral titer of DRV in the cell supernatant maintained at a relatively low level than that of B2c in astrocyte at 3 and 5 d.p.i., but N mRNA transcription levels of DRV was significantly higher than that of B2c at 3 and 5 d.p.i. (Figure 2C) . The IFA results showed that DRV persistently replicated in astrocytes and large immunofluorescence foci could be observed at 7 d.p.i., while no obvious immunofluorescence foci could be found in B2c-infected cells ( Figure 2D) . As a control, virus replication kinetics in primary neurons was also compared. It was found that viral titers of B2c were always higher than those of wt RABV at the indicated time points (Figure 2B) . The IFA results also showed that both DRV and B2c could efficiently replicate in neuron ( Figure 2D) .",

Thus, the immunoprecipitation of RIG-I was carried out and then resolved by Western blot by using an anti-ubiquitin antibody.

To compare the amount of dsRNA produced by wt and labattenuated RABV, primary astrocytes were infected with DRV or B2c at an MOI of 0.1. At 1 and 3 d.p.i., dsRNA was stained with specific antibody and observed by a confocal fluorescence microscope. The results demonstrate that more dsRNA is synthesized in B2c-infected astrocytes than those in DRV-infected cells ( Figure 4A) . The dsRNA intensity per cell in B2c-infected cell was significantly higher than that in DRV-infected cells (Figure 4B) , considering the similar RABV intensity per cell (Figure 4C) . The ratio of dsRNA intensity to RABV intensity in B2c-infected astrocyte was significantly higher than that in DRV-infected cells ( Figure 4D) . These results suggest that lab-attenuated RABV produces more viral dsRNA than wt RABV during viral replication, (20 FFU) . (e) At 7 d.p.i., mice were euthanized, perfused with PBS and then fixed with 4% PFA. The brains were subsequently coated with paraffin, and the brain sections were stained with antibodies against GFAP (red), RABV P protein (green), or DAPI (blue). The white arrows indicate RABV-infected astrocytes. The scale bars represent 50 \u00b5m. (F) The same brain sections as (e) were stained with antibodies against MAP2 (green), RABV P protein (red), or DAPI (blue), then visualized under a confocal microscope. The scale bars represent 50 \u00b5m. Notably, B2c titers were significantly increased in MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes compared with wt astrocytes (Figures 5A,B) . Moreover, the cell numbers of immunofluorescence plaques in MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes caused by B2c infection were significantly more than those in wt astrocytes (Figures 5E,F) . In contrast, MAVS deficiency had no significant influence on DRV replication and spread in astrocytes (Figures 5A,E) . TBK1 is an I\u03baB kinase downstream of the MAVS signaling pathway and is critical for IRF3 phosphorylation. Treatment with the TBK1 specific inhibitor BX795 significantly increased B2c titers in astrocytes (Figures 5C,D) . To verify these observations in vivo, MAVS\u2212/\u2212 mice were i.c. infected with DRV or B2c, and virus infection of astrocytes was determined by IFA. We found that both DRV and B2c could efficiently infected MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (Figures 5G,H) . Taken together, these findings suggest that MAVS signaling significantly restricts the replication and spread of lab-attenuated but not wt RABV in astrocytes.",

It was found that the expression levels of Claudin-5 and Occludin were unchanged, while ZO-1 was significantly reduced after the cells were treated with the supernatants from B2c-infected wt astrocyte ( Figure 7C) . However, this reduction was attenuated in cells treated with the supernatants from MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes infected with B2c. No significant changes in ZO-1 expression were observed in b.END3 cells treated with supernatants from wt or MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocyte infected with DRV ( Figure 7D) . Similarly, IFA results showed that ZO-1 expression was significantly decreased in b.END3 cells cocultured with the supernatants from B2c-infected astrocytes collected at 48 h p.i. (Figure 7E) . ZO-1 fluorescence intensity was only slightly decreased in b.END3 cells cocultured with the supernatants from B2c-infected MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes collected at 48 h p.i., indicating that cell-to-cell contact was not significantly decreased in these cells. Moreover, no ZO-1 degradation was observed in b.END3 cells cocultured with the supernatants from wt or MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes infected with DRV. To be noted, no significant changes in Claudin-5 and Occludin expression were detected in either wt or MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes upon RABV infection (Figures 7C,E) . Together, these results illustrate that lab-attenuated, but not wt, RABV upregulates the production of inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes, resulting in ZO-1 degradation in BMECs and subsequent increases in BBB permeability. Furthermore, these results indicate that cytokine production is dependent on MAVS signaling pathway. ",

PRR activation in astrocytes results in the expression of many immune mediators, including type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines (6, 7) . During infections caused by pathogens for which glia are not susceptible targets, activation of the innate immune system caused by pathogen recognition in astrocytes may promote antiviral immune responses in susceptible neurons, as well as CNS leukocyte trafficking (3, 5, 7) . In an early report, primary murine, feline, and human astrocytes were infected with wt (SRV) and lab-attenuated RABV (ERA) (34), after which viral loads and replication were assessed by infectivity assay and immunofluorescence. The results showed that astrocytes can be infected by RABV, suggesting that astrocytes may play a role in viral spread and persistence and/or neuronal dysfunction (34) . However, in that study, viral loads and replication were evaluated only at the early time point after infection (3 d.p.i.) . In this present study, the growth of DRV with that of B2c, which were used as a pair of wt and lab-attenuated RABV in previous studies (38) (39) (40) , was compared in a long-term experiment. Surprisingly, we found that lab-attenuated RABV, but not wt RABV, caused abortive replication in astrocytes, a feature that may be associated with the ability of the virus to evade the innate immune response. Productive infection of the astrocyte is critical for neurotropic pathogens to induce encephalitis. Astrocytes sensed viral entry into the CNS and mounted a type I IFN response, which rapidly restricts the virus after neuronal transport into the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that TLR3\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes were more permissive to HSV infection and caused severe symptom of encephalitis and tissue damage, which was due to impaired type I IFN production in the absence of TLR3 (30) . A recently work found that abortively infected astrocytes are the major producers of IFN-\u03b2 after infection of the brain with diverse neurotropic viruses, including TMEV, RABV, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (35) . Consistent with these studies, we also found that the abortive infection of lab-attenuated RABV in astrocytes was related to its ability to activate IFN signaling pathway. Basal ISG expression levels are an important determinant of susceptibility to viral infection. We have found that astrocytes have higher basal expression levels of the mRNAs encoding ISG proteins, such MDA5 and STAT1, and other molecules crucial for recognizing viral invasion and creating an more antiviral environment than neurons (9) , which may explain why lab-attenuated RABV activates the innate immune response to a degree sufficient to restrict viral replication in astrocytes but not in neurons.",

Similarly, Takeuchi et al. observed dsRNA formation in cells infected with Sendai virus (50) with C protein knocked out but not in cells infected with wt SeV, indicating that the C protein limits or masks dsRNA production (51) . Both MeV and SeV are within the family Paramyxoviridae, thus it is possible that their C protein possess the similar function to subvert the production of dsRNA. Ebola virus protein VP35 adopts a unique strategy to mask key cellular recognition sites on dsRNA (52) . A recently study showed that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) activity is the key to prevent early induction of dsRNA. Replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is greatly attenuated in vivo and severely restricted in primary cells even during the early phase of virus infection (53) . In this present study, by exchanging viral genes between wt and lab-attenuated RABV, we found that single N, P, and G of wt RABV could not suppress dsRNA formation (data not shown).

            "text": "The BBB, which is composed of specialized BMECs joined by TJs and ensheathed by astrocytes and pericytes, plays an important role in protecting the CNS. Our previous studies have shown that RABV does not infect BMECs, nor does it modulate TJ protein expression in BMECs (39) . However, brain extracts prepared from mice infected with lab-attenuated RABV but not wt RABV reduced TJ protein expression in BMECs, indicating that the above enhancements of BBB permeability and reductions in TJ protein expression are not caused by RABV infection. Rather, they are caused by virus-induced inflammatory chemokines/ cytokines. The innate immune mechanisms that regulate BBB function in the setting of infectious diseases have been appreciated only recently. Multiple inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and VEGF, disrupt BBB and TJ integrity in BMECs (46, 50, (54) (55) (56) , and inflammatory cytokine signaling at the BBB during infection facilitates leukocyte trafficking into the CNS, which is essential for the clearance of many pathogens (39, 41) . Our present study demonstrates that lab-attenuated RABV induces production of several inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes, especially TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and VEGF, which cause disruption of the BBB and TJ integrity. Our findings suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in regulating BBB permeability as a major source of cytokines during viral infection. Furthermore, we found that the production of inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes by lab-attenuated RABV was dependent on MAVS signaling pathway, underscoring the critical role of MAVS signaling in defensing against RABV infection in CNS. 8 | The proposed model for the mechanism through which wild-type (wt) and lab-attenuated rabies virus (RABV) infect astrocytes. During infection, lab-attenuated RABV produces double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor protein for RIG-I and MDA5, leads to enhanced production of interferon, as well as some IFN-stimulated genes, which limit RABV replication and spread. MAVS activation stimulates the p38 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and induces cytokine production in astrocytes. Inflammatory cytokines promote blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, enabling peripheral inflammatory cells and antibodies to infiltrate into the central nervous system, thereby facilitating RABV clearance. In contrast, wt RABV prevents activation of the MAVS signaling pathway by restricting dsRNA production. cOnclUsiOn Based on the results, we propose the following model: labattenuated RABV produces dsRNA recognized by RIG-I, MDA5, or both, resulting in the activation of the MAVS signaling pathway in astrocytes. IFN expression induces the transcription of hundreds of ISGs to inhibit RABV replication in astrocytes and causes the abortive infection by lab-attenuated RABV. The inflammatory cytokines induced by lab-attenuated RABV enhance BBB permeability, enabling immune cells and antibodies to infiltrate the CNS and facilitate RABV clearance. Conversely, wt RABV restricts dsRNA production and then evades recognition by the innate immune system, resulting in persistent viral replication in astrocytes (Figure 8 ). ",

During infection, lab-attenuated RABV produces double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor protein for RIG-I and MDA5, leads to enhanced production of interferon, as well as some IFN-stimulated genes, which limit RABV replication and spread. MAVS activation stimulates the p38 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and induces cytokine production in astrocytes. Inflammatory cytokines promote blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, enabling peripheral inflammatory cells and antibodies to infiltrate into the central nervous system, thereby facilitating RABV clearance. In contrast, wt RABV prevents activation of the MAVS signaling pathway by restricting dsRNA production.",
