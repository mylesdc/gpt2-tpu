            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are the largest genetic class of viruses and include many serious human pathogens. All positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with intracellular membrane rearrangements such as single-or double-membrane vesicles. However, the exact sites of RNA synthesis and crucial topological relationships between relevant membranes, vesicle interiors, surrounding lumens, and cytoplasm generally are poorly defined. We applied electron microscope tomography and complementary approaches to flock house virus (FHV)-infected Drosophila cells to provide the first 3-D analysis of such replication complexes. The sole FHV RNA replication factor, protein A, and FHV-specific 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate incorporation localized between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes inside ;50-nm vesicles (spherules), which thus are FHV-induced compartments for viral RNA synthesis. All such FHV spherules were outer mitochondrial membrane invaginations with interiors connected to the cytoplasm by a necked channel of ;10-nm diameter, which is sufficient for ribonucleotide import and product RNA export. Tomographic, biochemical, and other results imply that FHV spherules contain, on average, three RNA replication intermediates and an interior shell of ;100 membrane-spanning, self-interacting protein As. The results identify spherules as the site of protein A and nascent RNA accumulation and define spherule topology, dimensions, and stoichiometry to reveal the nature and many details of the organization and function of the FHV RNA replication complex. The resulting insights appear relevant to many other positive-strand RNA viruses and support recently proposed structural and likely evolutionary parallels with retrovirus and double-stranded RNA virus virions.",

The similarity of these structures suggests that RNA replication by such otherwise distinct viruses involves important conserved features related to membranes. For some viruses, the localization of viral replicase proteins [11, 17, 23, [26] [27] [28] or viral RNA synthesis [5, 15, 29] suggest that such spherules may contain or comprise the viral RNA replication complex. For brome mosaic virus (BMV) and some other viruses, twodimensional (2-D) electron microscopy (EM) reveals that a fraction of such spherules have interiors that appear to be connected to the cytoplasm by membranous necks [15, 25, 28] . However, limitations inherent in random sectioning and 2-D analysis prevent standard EM from resolving many issues crucial to understanding spherule structure and function, such as the range of spherule diameter and volume, and whether all spherule interiors are connected to the cytoplasm or if some bud free from their adjacent bounding membranes.",

            "text": "To resolve these and other issues central to the mechanism of RNA replication, we used EM tomography (EMT) to provide the first, to our knowledge, three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructural study of the membrane-bound RNA replication complexes of a (\u00fe)RNA virus. EMT generates highresolution, 3-D images or tomograms by digitally processing a series of 50-100 electron micrographs collected as a specimen is tilted in 1-2 8 increments on an axis perpendicular to the electron beam [30] . Similar 3-D EMT analyses have been crucial to reveal many important features of complex cellular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus [31] [32] [33] [34] , endoplasmic reticulum [33, 34] , and mitochondria [35] [36] [37] . We chose flock house virus (FHV), the best characterized member of the Nodaviridae, as a (\u00fe)RNA virus with advantageous features for such studies. FHV has been used as a model to study RNA replication [8, 9, [38] [39] [40] , virion structure and assembly [41, 42] , and genomic packaging [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . FHV has a 4.5-kb bipartite RNA genome in which RNA2 (1.4 kb) encodes the capsid precursor [47] whereas RNA1 (3.1 kb) encodes an RNA silencing inhibitor [48, 49] and a multifunctional RNA replication factor, protein A [40, 50, 51] . Protein A, the only FHV protein needed for RNA replication, is directed by an Nterminal targeting and transmembrane sequence to outer mitochondrial membranes, where it colocalizes by immunofluorescence with the sites of viral RNA synthesis [8, 38] . Gradient flotation and dissociation assays showed that protein A behaves as an integral transmembrane protein [38] . Additionally, protease digestion and selective permeabilization after differential epitope tagging demonstrated that protein A is inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane with the N terminus in the inner membrane space or matrix, while the majority of the protein A sequence is exposed to the cytoplasm [38] . Protein A also self-interacts in vivo in ways that are important for RNA replication [52] . Like many other (\u00fe)RNA viruses [4, 5, 7, 15, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , FHV infection induces the formation of ;50-nm membranous vesicles or spherules, which, for the case of FHV, are found between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes [8] .",

Prior immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling EM localized protein A to the outer mitochondrial membrane in FHV-infected cells [8] . However, in those prior attempts at immunogold labeling, fixation conditions needed to preserve spherule ultrastructure abolished protein A antigenicity for the polyclonal antibody used, hence blocking protein A localization relative to spherules. To overcome this, we identified a monoclonal antibody against protein A [9] that was able to detect protein A under fixation conditions that sufficiently retained spherule ultrastructure. Immunogold EM with this protein A monoclonal antibody revealed that nearly all protein A was in or on mitochondrial spherules in FHV-infected cells ( Figure 1 ). Over 900 gold particles in 25 different electron micrographs were counted and 88% 6 5% of the specific gold labeling density above background (see Materials and Methods) was associated with spherules. Cytoplasmic labeling, presumably including protein A being translated and/or trafficked in the cytoplasm, was just 2% 6 7% above background labeling levels. The remaining 10% 6 5% of immunogold label was associated with mitochondria but not discernable spherules, including gold particles on the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane where some protein A might have been localized that was not, or not yet, internalized into spherules. The clustering pattern of immunogold particles in a subset of spherules may be due to nonuniform epitope exposure or signal amplification by secondary antibodies. To avoid over-weighting the calculations due to such clustering effects, we also analyzed the same 25 micrographs counting each cluster as one event. The resulting count of clusters gave a very similar pattern to the one described above (94% spherule associated).",

The largest class of RNA viruses, the positive-strand RNA viruses, replicate their genomes on intracellular membranes. However, little is understood about how and why these viruses use membranes in RNA replication. The well-studied flock house virus (FHV) replicates its RNA on mitochondrial membranes. We found that the single FHV RNA replication factor and newly synthesized FHV RNA localized predominantly in numerous infection-specific membrane vesicles inside the outer mitochondrial membrane. We used electron microscope tomography to image these membranes in three dimensions and found that the interior of each vesicle was connected to the cytoplasm by a single necked channel large enough to import ribonucleotide substrates and to export product RNA. The results suggest that FHV uses these vesicles as replication compartments, which may also protect replicating RNA from competing processes and host defenses. These findings complement results from other viruses to support possible parallels between genome replication by positive-strand RNA viruses and two distinct virus classes, double-stranded RNA and reverse-transcribing viruses.",

For mitochondria from uninfected cells, background labeling levels were independent of the addition or omission of BrUTP and averaged 15% of the total immunogold labeling of BrUTP-treated mitochondria from FHV-infected cells. We found that using isolated mitochondria was advantageous for the BrUTP-labeling experiments because of low transfection efficiencies of BrUTP into whole Drosophila cells. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain some immunogold labeling results using intact Drosophila cells, which also showed that spherules were the major sites of BrUTP-labeling ( Figure 2C ).

Figure 4A shows part of the relationship between the electron density of the mitochondrion in Figure 3A and its 3-D map, and Video S3 provides a much more dynamic visualization of this relationship and the complete 3-D map. For clarity, the cytoplasmic faces of outer mitochondrial membranes are colored blue, spherule membranes are white, and inner mitochondrial membranes are yellow. Figure 4B shows a close-up view of a portion of the 3-D map in Figure 4A that demonstrates the connection of the spherules to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This and other similar maps confirmed as noted above that the spherule membranes (white) are continuous with the outer mitochondrial membrane (blue). Figure 4C is a 90 8 rotation of Figure 4B that shows a view looking down on the surface of an FHV-modified mitochondrion, with the outer membrane (blue) rendered translucent to reveal the spherules beneath (Video S4). The necked channels connecting the interior of each spherule to the cytoplasm (red arrowhead) are clearly visible as circular openings in the outer membrane. For 150 individual spherules in four mitochondria from four cells and three experiments, we measured the interior diameters of these neck channels as the distance between the two lipid bilayers, from inner leaflet to inner leaflet, at the point where the tomographic plane sliced through the center of the neck. The resulting distribution of neck diameters is shown in Figure 5A . The average diameter of the neck channel was 10.5 6 1.8 nm ( Figure 5A ), which is more than large enough to allow import of ribonucleotides and export of RNA products (diameter , 2 nm).",

The number of (\u00fe)RNA1 and (\u00fe)RNA2 per cell increased from ;40,000 molecules of each RNA species at 4 hpi to ;2-3 million each by 24 hpi ( Figure 6C ). Such (\u00fe)RNA products primarily accumulate in the cytoplasm for translation and encapsidation, and only a minor fraction of (\u00fe)RNAs fractionate with the membrane-associated RNA replication complex (P. Van Wynsberghe, P. Ahlquist, unpublished data). By contrast to positive-strand export and accumulation in the cytoplasm, FHV (\u00c0)RNAs appear to function only as RNA replication intermediates and are completely membraneassociated (P. Van Wynsberghe, P. Ahlquist, unpublished data). (\u00c0)RNA thus is a key measure of a minimal RNA replication complex, because every mature RNA replication complex, active in (\u00fe)RNA synthesis, must contain at least one (\u00c0)RNA template. Therefore, the number of (\u00c0)RNAs gives an estimate of the maximal number of replication complexes per cell. (\u00c0)RNA1 accumulation plateaued by 8 hpi at ;16,000 copies per cell ( Figure 6D ). (\u00c0)RNA2 accumulation increased throughout the first 24 hpi, although more slowly after 12 hpi, reaching ;50,000 molecules per cell by 24 hpi ( Figure 6D ).",

To measure the number of spherules per cell, we collected FHV-infected Drosophila S2 cells at 12 hpi, processed them for transmission EM, and imaged 25 randomly sectioned cell profiles. All spherules in each imaged cell section were counted and divided by the cell section volume, which was calculated by measuring the cell area using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and multiplying by the effective section thickness (see Materials and Methods). The number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the resulting density of spherules by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 lm-diameter Drosophila S2 cells [56] (and our independent, matching measurements).",

Immunogold labeling identified virus-induced membranous spherules as the sites of accumulation of the sole FHV RNA replication protein, protein A, and of FHV RNA synthesis (Figures 1 and  2) . EMT revealed that all FHV spherules maintain an open connection with the cytoplasm with a diameter of ;10 nm, which is wide enough to allow the exchange of ribonucleotides and RNA products (Figures 4C and 5A ). Our stoichiometry measurements further revealed the presence of, on average, 100 copies of the viral replicase protein A and 2-4 RNA replication intermediates per spherule ( Table 1) . As discussed further below, these findings have substantial implications for the structure, assembly, and function of the FHV RNA replication complex and likely also for the organization of many similar membrane-associated viral RNA replication complexes. In addition to advancing understanding of viral replication mechanisms, such insights also should prove valuable for developing additional antiviral strategies or agents.",

Thus, the average spherule interior membrane surface area of 6,000 nm 2 ( Figure 5B ) provides enough space to accommodate at most ;150 protein A molecules, under a perfect close-packing arrangement. Therefore, the measured value of ;100 protein A molecules per spherule (Table 1) is near saturation for the spherule interior membrane surface area.

Such a shell would explain the formation and maintenance of the high-energy membrane deformation of spherules. A shell of these dimensions appears reasonable, given that the main shell of a reovirus core is 60 nm in diameter and is composed of 120 copies of a slightly larger protein k1 (142 kDa) [59] . The distribution of FHV spherule size spans a defined range of ;30-45-nm intramembrane diameter, suggesting some flexibility in the assembly of the protein A shell. Other examples of highdensity protein shells of flexible size and shape include the capsids of retroviruses, influenza, and retrotransposons [60] [61] [62] . For example, one species of Ty retrotransposon forms virus-like capsids that have a 30-50-nm range of diameters, similar to FHV spherules, and contain on average 300 copies of a 381-amino acid protein subunit [62] , a protein content very close to the FHV spherule average of 100 copies of 998amino acid protein A. Endocytic vesicles, secretory transport vesicles, and synaptic vesicles are further examples of protein-induced membrane vesicles that each have a range of variable sizes (50-100-nm diameter), despite being formed by regular arrays of uniform proteins [63, 64] .",

If RNA1 and RNA2 were in separate spherules (i.e., 50% of spherules containing RNA1 and 50% containing RNA2), then the ratios of (\u00c0)RNA1 and (\u00c0)RNA2 to total spherules (Table 1) imply each RNA1-containing spherule would have two replication intermediates, and each RNA2-containing spherule would have approximately four replication intermediates. Because RNA1 (3.1 kb) is twice as long as RNA2 (1.4 kb), the total RNA content in both cases then would be nearly equal. If RNA1 and RNA2 were together in the same spherule, then each spherule would hold on average three replication intermediates (one RNA1 and two RNA2). The possibility of spherules containing both species of RNAs is intriguing, considering the interactions of FHV RNAs required for replication: FHV subgenomic RNA3, which is templated from RNA1, transactivates RNA2 replication and, in turn, RNA3 replication is suppressed by the resulting progeny RNA2 [70] . RNA3, and not its protein product, is responsible for transactivating RNA2 [70] . However, it is also possible that RNA3 is produced in one spherule during RNA1 replication and then exported to the cytoplasm prior to transactivating RNA2.",

Among these, one of the best-studied with regard to the localization and stoichiometry of RNA replication complex components is BMV. BMV and FHV differ in many important respects including that BMV encodes a much larger complement of RNA replication proteins [15, 19] . Nevertheless, although the understanding that we present here for FHV RNA replication complexes is more advanced in many ways, the known characteristics of BMV RNA replication complexes are strikingly similar to those for FHV. Both BMV and FHV induce spherules of similar dimensions where viral RNA synthesis and viral replication proteins are localized [15] . BMV replication protein 1a, which is sufficient to induce spherules [15] , is also a strongly membrane-associated [71] , self-interacting [72, 73] protein that is present at high copy number per spherule [15] . Similarly, whereas the ultrastructural organization of hepatitis C virus RNA replication complexes has not been defined, recent results suggest that these may also involve a dramatic excess of nonstructural protein copies per (\u00c0)RNA [74] .",

Although some or most of this variability reflects real ultrastructural differences, at least some of the perceived differences may be due to differences in perspective under conventional 2-D imaging. Our tomography results demonstrated that equivalent FHV spherules appeared to vary in morphology and topological relation to adjacent membranes when viewed in two dimensions from different perspectives (Figures 3C and 3D) .

The results presented here for FHV validate and extend these parallels by showing that all FHV spherules are Figure 4 , the spherule membrane is white and the contiguous outer mitochondrial membrane is blue. (B) Schematic of likely protein A organization within a spherule. Based on the average density of globular proteins, FHV protein A (112 kDa) is modeled in as a green sphere of ;7 nm in diameter. Based on the average of ;100 protein A molecules per spherule (Table 1) , the figure shows the potential packing arrangement of 50 protein A molecules in half a spherule. The spheres are shown lining the interior surface area of the spherule membrane because protein A is a transmembrane protein [38] . (C) Schematic representation of the structure and organization of the FHV RNA replication complex. Protein A (ptn A; green spheres) forms a shell within the mitochondrial membrane spherule within which RNA synthesis occurs (N \u00bc N terminus; C \u00bc C terminus). Protein A is also shown as possibly extending into the spherule neck, since it may be a determinant of the relatively constant 10-nm diameter neck. As noted in Figure 1 (white arrowheads), a small fraction of protein A may reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane external to spherules. The diagram shows (\u00fe)RNA synthesis (red arrow) from (\u00c0)RNA templates (black segmented line), which is the predominant form of FHV RNA synthesis throughout all but the earliest phases of FHV infection ( Figure 6A-6D) . doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050220.g007 membrane invaginations topologically equivalent to a budding, enveloped virion (Figure 4) , and that self-interacting, transmembrane protein A is present at levels sufficient to coat the inner spherule membrane in a multi-subunit shell similar to the capsids of retrovirus and dsRNA virus cores ( Figure 7) . As with dsRNA viruses, hepadnaviruses, and retroviruses, the high copy of protein A per spherule suggests that there may be threshold effects in replication protein expression to initiate replication. Further analysis of the structure, interactions, and function of FHV RNA replication complexes should provide additional insights into the basic mechanisms of (\u00fe)RNA virus replication and potentially identify new approaches for antiviral interference.",

For each of 25 randomly selected cells imaged in these sections, we then counted all observable spherules with diameters larger than 20 nm. The number of spherules counted for each cell then was divided by the relevant section volume, which was calculated by measuring the cell area using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and multiplying by the effective section thickness. The effective section thickness is a correction used to avoid overcounting spherules with centers outside of the 70-nm physical section, which would otherwise be counted twice if adjacent sections were analyzed. As previously used to calculate synaptic vesicles per cell [79] , this effective section thickness is the thickness that would encompass the centers of all counted spherules. In this case, the effective section thickness was 116 nm, based on adding 23 nm (the distance from the spherule center to a radius-perpendicular plane bisecting the spherule to yield a 20-nm-diameter section) to each face of the 70nm section. The number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the resulting density of spherules by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 lm-diameter Drosophila S2 cells [56] (and our independent, matching measurements).",

To survey the preservation quality and FHV-infection efficiency of the Drosophila cells, thin-sectioned material (;80 nm thick) was examined using a JEOL 1200FX electron microscope. 3-D reconstructions of portions of the cell containing FHV-infected mitochondria were generated using current techniques of electron tomography [80] . Sections were cut with a thickness of ;250 nm from blocks exhibiting well-preserved ultrastructure. These sections were stained for 30 min in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, followed by 30 min in lead salts. Fiducial cues consisting of 20-nm colloidal gold particles were deposited on both sides of the section. For each reconstruction, a series of images was collected with a JEOL 4000EX intermediate-voltage electron microscope operated at 400 kV. The specimens were irradiated before initiating a tilt series in order to limit anisotropic specimen thinning during image collection. Pre-irradiation in this manner subjected the specimen to the steepest portion of the nonlinear shrinkage profile before images were collected. Six tilt series were collected: five single-tilt and one doubletilt. ''FHV2'' was the highest resolution single-tilt reconstruction and ''FHV6'' was the high-resolution double-tilt reconstruction; the majority of the analyses were conducted on these two reconstructions. The single-tilt series were recorded at 40,000 magnification with an angular increment of 2 8 from \u00c060 8 to \u00fe60 8 about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope using a computer-controlled goniometer to increment accurately the angular steps. These single-axis tilt series were collected using a CCD camera with pixel dimensions 1,960 3 2,560. The pixel resolution was 0.55 nm. The illumination was held to near parallel beam conditions and optical density maintained constant by varying the exposure time. The IMOD package was used for generating the reconstructions [81] .",

The mitochondrial matrix, cytoplasm (Cyt) and examples of the many spherules (S) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) are labeled for reference. White arrowheads indicate gold particles at a mitochondrial membrane but not directly over a spherule. Black arrowheads indicate gold particles in the cytoplasm. As illustrated in panel A, islands of cytoplasm surrounded by a mitochondrial ring are seen frequently in EM sections of FHV-infected mitochondria. (C) A schematic, based on 3-D tomographic analysis shown below, of how such cytoplasmic islands are generated by EM sectioning of the frequently cup-shaped, FHV-modified mitochondria [see panel (B)].
