ZIKV is conveyed by a mosquito vector, Aedes species, which also acts as the vector species of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Methods. Arrival time of ZIKV importation (i.e., the time at which the first imported case was diagnosed) in each imported country was collected from publicly available data sources. Employing a survival analysis model in which the hazard is an inverse function of the effective distance as informed by the airline transportation network data, and using dengue and chikungunya virus transmission data, risks of importation and local transmission were estimated. Results. A total of 78 countries with imported case(s) have been identified, with the arrival time ranging from 1 to 44 weeks since the first ZIKV was identified in Brazil, 2015. Whereas the risk of importation was well explained by the airline transportation network data, the risk of local transmission appeared to be best captured by additionally accounting for the presence of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Discussion. The risk of importation may be high given continued global travel of mildly infected travelers but, considering that the public health concerns over ZIKV infection stems from microcephaly, it is more important to focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve pregnant women. The predicted risk of local transmission was frequently seen in tropical and subtropical countries with dengue or chikungunya epidemic experience.",

Moreover, these viruses are also conveyed by the common mosquito vector, Aedes species. Technically, the infected cases could be observed in any part of the world in the presence of Aedes species, but the risk of transmission in Latin American and Caribbean countries has been anticipated to be high (Musso, Cao-Lormeau & Gubler, 2015; Bogoch et al., 2016) . The transmission potential of ZIKV infection has been shown to be comparable to those of DENV and CHIKV (Nishiura et al., 2016a) . Considering that there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses, it is of utmost importance to intervene transmission by preventing mosquito biting (e.g., the use of repellent) or controlling Aedes species, most notably by targeting highly invasive species including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The control option of Aedes spp. includes source reduction (i.e., removal of water and covering water storage containers), the use of ovitrap, chemical control, bioinsecticides and biological control (e.g., mosquitofish) (Anonymous, 2016), while recent approaches include transgenic and symbiont-based approaches and the use of plant-borne molecules (Adelman & Tu, 2016; Benelli, 2016; Benelli & Mehlhorn, 2016) .",

The criterion to include a country as imported was the presence of a report based on confirmatory diagnosis made either by serological testing or detection of virus RNA. When ZIKV was isolated from mosquitoes or primates other than humans, it was considered that the country had already imported the virus, because the virus isolation implies that the local transmission had taken place. For each imported country, the arrival time was defined as the week in which the importation event had happened. When monthly or yearly data were only available or when a seroepidemiological study identified the local transmission, the median week was used as the week of importation. The latest time at which the importation week was systematically examined was 31 January 2016.",

Furthermore, the country-specific presence of Aedes species, especially focusing on Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africana, was explored (Kraemer et al., 2015; The Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, USA, 2016) . The list of countries with at least one of the abovementioned Aedes species was prepared, because the local human-vectorhuman transmission of ZIKV infection occurs only where the vector species are present. Similarly, we also retrieved the country-specific data regarding DENV and CHIKV epidemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016a; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016b) , because they share major vector species with ZIKV and their epidemics indicate that the vector species have been actively involved in local transmission. Moreover, it has been explicitly discussed that international spread of Zika virus followed the geographic path of CHIKV (Musso, Cao-Lormeau & Gubler, 2015) .

To avoid serious collinearity among Aedes, DENV and CHIKV, Cohen's kappa, an agreement statistic, was computed to examine correlations between two dichotomous explanatory variables. For each model, the optimal cut-off value of estimated risk was calculated using Youden's index. While model fit was assessed in week 46, the prediction has been made in week 92 that corresponds to the end of 2016. week number of the report has been originally written and we used it as the week of importation. When the exact week was unavailable, the midpoint of the available time window was used as the week of importation. The first day of the year was set to be the first Sunday of January. One year was calculated to be exactly equal to 52 weeks in our analysis. Although three confirmed cases of ZIKV infection were reported in Chile on 2 February 2016, that data was ignored in the present study because the latest time was set at fourth week of 2016. We also did not count a case report from Easter Island, a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, because the island is geographically distant from other parts of Chile and has only one airport (World Health Organization, Western Pacific Region, 2016) . In Australia, although one imported case is reported, there were no available sources of information to identify the date of confirmation. Instead, given that the corresponding article was received on 16 January 2013, we consider that the importation event took place in the previous year, 2012, and took the mid-point of the year as the week of importation (Kwong, Druce & Leder, 2013) . In Zambia, a cross sectional study was conducted, but there was no available information to identify the date of importation or survey.

Table 2 shows the fitting results of various models to predict the risk of local transmission. Comparing predictive performance by AUC among models with all possible combinations of three explanatory variables, the model with CHIKV and DENV appeared to yield the greatest value of AUC (0.90 (95% CI [0.60-1.00])). Figures 1B and 1D show the distribution of the estimated risk and ROC curve, respectively. Using the best model, sensitivity was as high as 96.4% (95% CI [89.6-100.0]), while the specificity was estimated at 67.7% (95% CI [60.5-74.9]). The second best model was the one with CHIKV only.

As reported elsewhere, ZIKV infection was often internationally spread by mildly infected travellers (Tappe et al., 2014; Kutsuna et al., 2014; Korhonen et al., 2016) . Potentially high importation risk in many temperate countries has motivated us to explore the risks of importation and local transmission fuelled by travellers. Our model is not as sophisticated as mapping precise risk of transmission using seasonal population dynamics of Aedes species and temperature/climatological data (Bogoch et al., 2016; Nah et al., in press ), but the findings at country levels from our study are broadly consistent with what has been briefly described at finer scales (Bogoch et al., 2016) . Without using finer scale spatial data (e.g., ecological data on Geographic Information Systems), our approach has crudely and clearly distinguished the risk of local transmission from importation risk at country levels using a more tractable approach. We have shown that the predicted risk of local transmission was frequently seen in tropical and subtropical countries with DENV or CHIKV epidemic experience, while the risk of importation was more scattered around the world. The diagnostic performance of risk model for local transmission was well supported by AUC value of 0.90. Our study contributes to the risk assessment practice at each country level using estimated risks of importation and local transmission expressed as probabilities. We have shown that the risk of importation may be high in several countries given continued global travel of mildly infected travellers. However, considering that the public health concerns over ZIKV infection stems from the presence of microcephaly, it is more important to focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve pregnant women. Compared with the risk of importation, the risk of local transmission was particularly highlighted in countries with DENV and CHIKV epidemic experience. Considering that the Olympic Game in Brazil 2016 will elevate the risk of ZIKV to spread over a wider spatial extent (Petersen et al., 2016) , the distinction between importation and local transmission will be even more important than it has been recognized. Whereas our risk model of local transmission relied on the presence of transmission by DENV or CHIKV, the use of such a dataset should be deemed only as a proxy. The sensitivity of our best model was 96.4%, and thus there is limited case in which the absence of DENV or CHIKV lead to the local transmission of ZIKV. However, the specificity was limited to 67.7%, indicating that there would be a number of countries in which ZIKV transmission has yet to occur even in the presence of DENV and CHIKV. Our simple model must have missed important additional predictors of local transmission in this regard, and such predictors have to be sought in the future studies. Moreover, to further improve the prediction, ecological data of vector behaviour at finer spatial scale must be incorporated with validation using epidemic data.",

The empirical data in Table 1 must have missed several importation events. Presented risks of importation and local transmission were thus probably underestimated on a whole. Second, the network data we used were static, and the airline transportation data represented only the number of flight routes (i.e., not the number of passengers). Nevertheless, assuming that the geographic patterns of travel have been maintained and only the travel volume has changed over short period of time, our simplistic approach is still justifiable to predict the global spread from 2015. Third, country-specific modelling exercise suffers from heterogeneity within each single country. For instance, the United States, China and Australia have both high and low risk areas of transmission due to vast land with different climatological areas.",
