Although effective, these drugs carry risks of increased bleeding and drug 'resistance', underpinning a drive for new antiplatelet agents. To discover such drugs, one strategy is to identify a suitable druggable target and then find small molecules that modulate it. A good and unexploited target is the platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, which promotes thrombus formation. To identify inhibitors of GPVI that are safe and bioavailable, we docked a FDA-approved drug library into the GPVI collagen-binding site in silico. We now report that losartan and cinanserin inhibit GPVI-mediated platelet activation in a selective, competitive and dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action likely underpins the cardioprotective effects of losartan that could not be ascribed to its antihypertensive effects. We have, therefore, identified small molecule inhibitors of GPVI-mediated platelet activation, and also demonstrated the utility of structure-based repurposing.",

Platelets adhere to exposed collagen fibres following injury of the vessel wall (physiological response) or rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque (pathological response). Circulating von Willibrand factor (vWF) complexes with exposed collagen fibres and together these proteins act as ligands for the platelet adhesion/activation receptors a2b1, the GPIb-IX-V complex, and glycoprotein (GP) VI [15, 16] . Adhesion via a2b1 and the GPIb-IX-V mediates platelet rolling and tethering, allowing the major platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, to interact with its ligand to mediate platelet activation. Once engaged, GPVI initiates tyrosine kinase-dependent signalling via the associated FcRc chain, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Ca 2+ release and subsequent granule secretion leads to the release of secondary mediators of platelet activation, including 5-HT and ADP, that act in an autocrine fashion. Concurrent with these events is the generation of thrombin and fibrinogen, which leads to the formation of a fibrin clot.",

            "text": "There are many mediators of platelet activation that could be targeted for drug development. GPVI activation is an early event in collagen-induced thrombus formation and is receiving increasing attention as a potential target for antiplatelet development. Recent characterisation of GPVI-Fc fusion proteins that block platelet-collagen interactions [17, 18] , as well as the development of humanised murine GPVI scFvs [19] , have highlighted GPVI as a therapeutic target. GPVI-Fc fusion proteins inhibit collagen responses in animal models, demonstrating a lack of toxicity in human trials, and no bleeding phenotype. The effectiveness of these biologicals in reducing thrombosis is reminiscent of endogenous mechanisms that regulate GPVI-collagen interactions through receptor shedding at high shear [20] . These data strengthen the argument for targeting the collagen-GPVI interaction for therapeutic intervention. However, administration of scFvs, antibodies or fusion proteins relies on intravenous injection and is therefore not a viable approach for self-administration or long-term use outside the clinic, especially for a highly prevalent disease. Development of orally bioavailable small, drug-like, GPVI-specific antagonists could, therefore, be of great therapeutic value [13, 14] as they would provide an alternative option for the management of thrombotic risk. In this study we describe the identification and characterisation of two selective GPVI receptor antagonists in vitro. %  1  cinanserin  67  2  ormetoprim  85  3  chloroadeonsine  59  4  deoxydenonine  0  5  zaleplon  100  6  altanserin  58  7  torasemide  64  8  pirenperone  57  9  didexoyinosine  0  10  losartan  100  11  methoxytryptamine  47  12  dideoxycytidine  0  13  piroxican  80  14  nicorandil  0  15  piceid  66  16  risperidone  47  17  deoxyadenosine  0  18  ralrirexed  45  19  tetrohydroacridine  100  20 vorcoazole 0 In silico identifies GPVI antagonists. Representative image capture of in silico docking into GPVI using Glide, with space filling model is shown in a, and H-bonding to relevant side chains is detailed in b. The 20 highest ranking compounds were screened for effects on Ca 2+ release by the GPVI-specific agonist CRP-XL (10 mg/ml) (c and d, % refers to percent inhibition of Ca 2+ release). Maximum Ca 2+ release is shown in white, compounds that inhibited Ca 2+ release by ,50% or more are in grey, and the remainder in black. Commercially available compounds that inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca 2+ release .50% were further screened by light transmission aggregometry to identify compounds displaying dose-dependent inhibition (e-j). Examples are shown of weak antagonism (g and h) and false positives (i and j).

Lys41 lies within the floor of the groove that forms the collagen binding site of GPVI [21, 26, 27] and compounds were ranked on their ability to bind in this region. Using a single point screen (Ca 2+ release) with a high dose of drug (100 mM) and a high dose of cross-linked collagen related peptide (CRP-XL, 10 mg/ml), we found that docking yielded a high success rate; of the top 20 compounds, 14 inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca 2+ release from fura2-AM-loaded washed human platelets by $50% (Figure 1c and 1d). Then, using light transmission aggregometry over a limited (5-6 point) 3-fold dilution series from 100 mM to 300 nM, we re-screened those drugs that had demonstrated inhibition of Ca 2+ release and were commercially available, to identify those which gave concentration-dependent inhibition of GPVI-mediated aggregation (Figure 1e-k) . Of these drugs, some were false positives (e.g. altanserin and pirenpirone - Figure 1i and j) while others showed only weak antagonism (e.g. zaleplon and deoxyadenosine - Figure 1g and h) .

The angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist losartan (Figure 1m ) also ranked highly as a potential antagonist (#10). Retrospective literature searches revealed that this compound had previously been reported to interact with the collagen binding pocket of GPVI [28] and inhibit platelet aggregation both in vitro [29] and in vivo [30] . The fact that losartan has been shown to interact with GPVI at the collagen binding site in an independent study validates our methodology and provides confidence that our docking parameters are appropriate. Losartan was included in subsequent experiments as it serves not only as a positive control, but also as a potential drug for repurposing if found to be selective and efficacious; losartan is a well-tolerated drug. Cinanserin was also included for further characterisation as it was ranked with the greatest probability of interacting with GPVI, and exhibited robust inhibition of Ca 2+ release ( Fig. 1c and 1e) . The high success rate of our computational screen (14 out of 20 compounds inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca 2+ release in vitro) validates the use of an in silico docking strategy for identifying potential receptor antagonists. Losartan and cinanserin inhibit Ca 2+ release and aggregation in washed human platelets We next conducted more detailed studies to determine precise IC 50 values for losartan and cinanserin using platelet functional assays. Ca 2+ release induced by the GPVI-specific agonist CRP-XL, and the endogenous ligand collagen, was measured and quantified. Both drugs inhibited Ca 2+ release in a concentrationdependent manner in response to both CRP-XL (Figure 2a-c) and collagen (Figure 2d-f ). Cinanserin and losartan had IC 50 values in the micromolar range, with losartan having an IC 50 value of 4 mM, 10-fold greater than that of cinanserin (40 mM). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of losartan and cinanserin on Ca 2+ release could be translated into effects on gross platelet function, we carried out light transmission aggregometry using washed human platelets. Both drugs exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to both CRP-XL (1 mg/ml, Figure 2g -i) and collagen (1 mg/ml, Figure 2j -l). IC 50 values were comparable to those for Ca 2+ release and are summarised in Table 1 .",

This phosphorylation leads to recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk, which mediates phosphorylation of a number of downstream targets leading to an increase in global tyrosine phosphorylation [32] . Both losartan and cinanserin reduced global tyrosine Recent studies pertaining to the antiplatelet effects of losartan have focused mainly on its inhibition of thromboxane A 2 receptor (TPR) signaling [33, 34] , rather than collagen. When platelet rich plasma is isolated from mice that have been injected with losartan (10 mg/kg) for 5 days, aggregation responses to the TPR agonist, U46619, are inhibited, and these inhibitory effects extend to thrombus formation in vivo [30] (FeCl 3 -induced injury model). Yet our studies indicate that losartan is, thus far, relatively selective for GPVI. To address this discrepancy, we examined the effects of losartan and cinanserin on U46619 (1 mM)-induced platelet aggregation in washed human platelets. Losartan (Figure 4a ) has an IC 50 of ,20 mM for U46619-induced platelet aggregation, compared to ,2-4 mM for collagen (1 mg/ml) and CRP-XL (1 mg/ml) ( Table 1 ). These results indicate that while losartan inhibits some component of TP receptor signalling, its effects on the GPVI receptor are more potent. Cinanserin had no effect on U46619-mediated aggregation (Figure 4b) .",

Cinanserin was included as a control as this drug has no effect on U46619-induced platelet activation (Figure 4b) .

Adding both compounds together results in a level of inhibition similar to that of losartan alone. Cinanserin also significantly reduced FITCfibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure when compared to SQ-29548 alone (Figure 4d ).

For a small molecule pharmacological agent, a competitive mechanism of action is preferable [35] , so we set out to determine whether our antagonists act in a competitive manner. Platelet responses to CRP-XL were measured over a range of concentrations in the presence or absence of 30 mM drug ( Figure 5 ). Losartan caused a rightward shift of the curve compared to vehicle alone, and increased the EC 50 value for CRP-XL 3-fold (n = 4, p = 0.0008). Minima and maxima values are equal to that of the control (Figure 5a) , indicative of competitive binding. Cinanserin also caused a rightward shift of the curve and increased the EC 50 of CRP-XL by 2-fold (n = 4, p = 0.0487) suggesting it also acts in a competitive manner (Figure 5b) . We next measured levels of GPVI at the cell surface by flow cytometry to experimentally verify that that the inhibitory effects of losartan and cinanserin were not due to drug-mediated decreases in receptor levels; neither drug affected GPVI levels (n = 3). Losartan is one of a class of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that also includes valsartan and olmesartan, amongst others. Valsartan does not have the protective effects on cardiovascular outcomes reported for losartan in vivo [36] , suggesting that the inhibitory effects of losartan on GPVI may be unique amongst this drug class, and there is structural evidence to support this [28] . Three sartans were compared with losartan for effects on GPVI-mediated Ca 2+ release to determine whether GPVI antagonism is shared amongst this drug class. Losartan was the most potent and efficacious inhibitor of collagen-induced Ca 2+ release (10 mg/ml collagen, n = 3, Figure 6 ), with some activity observed for the pro-drug olmesartan medoxomil.",

In human phase I clinical trials, Revacept had no adverse effects on health or bleeding time, with platelets showing reduced responses to collagen, but not to ADP or thrombin, ex vivo (similar to our observations for losartan and cinanserin in vitro). Although Revacept may protect against pathological thrombosis, administration requires recurrent intravenous injection and patients cannot self-administer at home. In addition, continued administration over prolonged periods may lead to the generation of antibodies by the host immune system that neutralise the fusion protein. The provision of orally available small molecule drugs that inhibit GPVI interactions with exposed collagens may provide a new clinical route for the long-term management of recurrent arterial thrombosis.",

            "text": "To find such drugs, we adopted a drug repurposing strategy to identify new GPVI receptor antagonists from a library of FDAapproved drugs. Using this unbiased approach, we identified compounds that demonstrated GPVI antagonism and selectivity with IC 50 values in the micromolar range. Losartan is a generic FDA-approved compound for the treatment of hypertention, while cinanserin is a 5-HT receptor antagonist which, although not used in clinical practice for decades, has recently attracted attention as an inhibitor of SARS coronoavirus replication [43, 44] . Neither of these compounds are associated with bleeding complications, but, retrospectively, both had been reported to have effects on platelet function. In addition, losartan had been shown to interact with GPVI at the collagen binding site at/around Lys41, by NMR [28] . Due to previous observations that losartan can affect TPR signaling [30] , we looked for effects on TPR-mediated platelet activation by the agonist U46619. Losartan inhibited TPR signaling with an IC 50 value ,10-fold higher than for GPVI. In addition, losartan (and cinanserin) reduce FITC-fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure in response to CRP-XL when TPR is inhibited by SQ-29548. This inhibition is much greater than that of SQ-29548 alone, demonstrating that both losartan and cinanserin have effects on CRP-XL-induced platelet aggregation not attributable to TPR. It is, therefore, reasonable to say that based on our studies losartan is not specific for GPVI, but displays selectivity for this receptor in washed human platelets and whole blood experiments. Most drugs lack total specificity and hit more than one target, and in this case, targeting both the GPVI and the TP receptor may actually prove beneficial in terms of antiplatelet activity. Indeed, the TP receptor antagonist terutroban showed promise as an antiplatelet in phase II clinical trials, but was found to offer no advantage over aspirin [5, [45] [46] [47] with regards to bleeding risk [46] . Cinanserin appears to be more selective for GPVI than losartan, but its IC 50 was high (,40 mM) and it is unlikely to reach therapeutic levels in the blood. It may serve as a starting point for future drug design but in terms of drug repurposing it s not a viable candidate.",

            "text": "Losartan may hold more promise in terms of immediate clinical application as an antiplatelet agent. This well-tolerated antihypertensive undergoes conversion (,14%) to a metabolite (EXP3174) that is 10-40-fold more potent than the parent drug. Both compounds act at the ATII type I receptor to antagonise ATII-mediated effects in vivo. A recent study demonstrated that mice administered daily injections of losartan for 5 days exhibit reduced platelet aggregation in response to U46619 ex vivo, implicating losartan as a TP receptor antagonist. Mice also demonstrate reduced thrombus formation in vivo (pathological), but not tail bleeding times (physiological). It is interesting to note that these in vivo outcomes are similar to that of Revacept (a soluble GPVI-Fc fragment), which also reduces thrombus formation in vivo while having minimal effects on physiological bleeding responses. However, the authors of this study did not examine CRP-XL-or collagen-induced signaling. The antagonistic effects on GPVI signalling of losartan appears to be unique amongst the sartan drug class -some activity is seen for the pro-drug olmesartan medoxomil, but rapid conversion to its active form (olmesartan), which does not antagonise GPVI-mediated Ca 2+ release, is unlikely to exert GPVI antagonism in vivo. It is likely that the anti-platelet effects of losartan can be attributed to inhibition of both GPVI and TP signalling. Data from the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) and follow-up studies linked losartan with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (stroke and myocardial infarction) [48] [49] [50] , and improved clinical outcomes. The authors of the 2002 LIFE study state 'losartan seems to have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction' [48] , and it is tempting to speculate that this could be due to its antiplatelet effects. A similar study of valsartan (VALUE [36] ) did not show any effect on cardiovascular outcome, and this may be due to the fact that valsartan does not have the antiplatelet properties and GPVI antagonism that losartan does. With regards to whether losartan is likely to reach plasma concentrations high enough to elicit antiplatelet effects in vivo, adults given 50 mg losartan daily for 7 days have Cmax values of the parent drug, and its metabolite, of 224 ng/ml and 212 ng/ml, respectively, equating to a plasma concentration of around 500 nM. The IC 50 of losartan for CRP or collagen induced platelet aggregation or Ca 2+ release is around 2-4 mM; a concentration of 500 nM losartan gives around 10-15% inhibition of platelet responses to GPVI agonists in our hands. Losartan can be given at doses of up to 150 mg per day and it is quite possible that, certainly at higher doses, plasma levels will reach concentrations high enough to reduce platelet responses to collagen.",

Aspirin, although the gold standard for antiplatelet therapy is, actually, associated with a slight increase in the risk of haemorrhagic stroke. Losartan is, therefore, more efficacious than aspirin for the prevention of stroke, and not reported to have any bleeding effects associated with its clinical use. It is also a generic drug and therefore cost effective. Further to this, losartan, and other ARBs and ACE inhibitors, have been shown to improve outcomes for Alzheimer's Disease patient by improving cerebral blood flow and reducing inflammatory responses [51] . It appears that losartan could offer a broad range of health benefits in an increasingly aging population.",

In summary, we report the identification of two GPVI-selective antagonists that may serve as a basis for future drug design (cinanserin) or repurposing (losartan). Further work will be required to determine the efficacy of losartan as a bone fide GPVI inhibitor in vivo, but our study sets the scene for a new wave of antiplatelet agents that target GPVI, and a offers a new strategy for the management of cardiovascular risk.",
