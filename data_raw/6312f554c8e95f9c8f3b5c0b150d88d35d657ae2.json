Members of this family including rhinoviruses A, B and C, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and enterovirus are responsible for important pediatric enteric and respiratory diseases. Several reports have shown that rhinovirus C is associated with asthma exacerbations. [1] [2] [3] [4] Non-polio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71 have been associated with hand, foot and mouth disease in the United States and Asia, 5 whereas coxsackievirus A24 and enterovirus 70 have been related to conjunctivitis outbreaks and echoviruses 13, 18, and 30 have caused outbreaks of viral meningitis in the United States. 6 In the late summer of 2014, clusters of severe respiratory infections due to enterovirus D68 had been reported in children throughout the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. 7 These children presented with asthma exacerbation and were generally characterized by low-grade or absent fever, wheezing, dyspnea, and hypoxia. 8, 9 Severe cases of the disease needed mechanical ventilation, and on rare occasions, children developed acute focal limb weakness with non-enhancing spinal cord lesions following the respiratory illness. 8, 9 The purposes of this report were to describe the clinical findings of an EV-D68 infection outbreak in Mexico City and identify genetic relationship with the strains reported in United States, Europe, and Asia. During September, we detected an increase in enterovirus/rhinovirus identification on respiratory samples from hospitalized children with pneumonia or asthma exacerbation (none with paralysis), of which 24 were EV-D68-positive.",

These data are lower, compared with 36% of EV-D68 cases tested by CDC in 49 states from August 2014 to January 2015. 15 This is the first time that we detect an increase in respiratory diseases related to EV-D68, somewhat expected due to the closeness to the United States and the continuous flow of individuals between the two countries. Molecular analysis of EV-D68 from Mexico City tended to group with US sequences, supporting this hypothesis. EV-D68 has been classified into three clades: A, B, and C, 16 but recently a distinct clade B1 emerged. 17 Strains from the United States and Europe during 2014 belong to this clade, including viruses associated with neurological illness.

Our pediatric patients behave similarly, and were afebrile and had more dyspnea, wheezing, and conjunctival discharge than children with rhinovirus infection or other viral infection. Children with EV-D68 infection had abnormal blood counts with neutrophilia and in our patients a decreased lymphocyte count but not statistically different from that found in children with rhinovirus infection.",
