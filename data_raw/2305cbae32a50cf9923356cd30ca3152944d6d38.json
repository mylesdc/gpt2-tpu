Our recent studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes limits immune detection and IFN-b synthesis via deacetylation of its peptidoglycan, which renders the bacterium resistant to lysozyme degradation. Here, we examined signaling requirements for the massive IFN-b production resulting from the infection of murine macrophages with a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes, DpgdA, which is unable to modify its peptidoglycan. We report the identification of unconventional signaling pathways to the IFN-b gene, requiring TLR2 and bacterial internalization. Induction of IFN-b was independent of the Mal/TIRAP adaptor protein but required TRIF and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. These pathways were stimulated to a lesser degree by wild-type L. monocytogenes. They operated in both resident and inflammatory macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity, but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The novelty of our findings thus lies in the first description of TLR2 and TRIF as two critical components leading to the induction of the IFN-b gene and in uncovering that individual macrophage populations adopt different strategies to link pathogen recognition signals to IFN-b gene expression.",

Cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) respond to cytosolic bacterial products and contribute to the induction of the innate immune response [5, 6] . Previous studies in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and epithelial cells show that in these cell types the synthesis of IFN-I in response to infection with L. monocytogenes is independent of TLRs and their adapters, relying exclusively on signals originating from cytosolic sensors [5] [6] [7] [8] . DNA as well as cyclic dinucleotides released from lysed bacteria were suggested to function as the relevant L. monocytogenes PAMPs [9] [10] [11] . Several cytosolic proteins with the ability to sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids have recently been described [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Cytosolic recognition of L. monocytogenes causes the activation of the serine/threonine kinase TBK1 and the phosphorylation of its substrate transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 [7, 8] .

Interestingly, L. monocytogenes modifies its PGN, with fifty per cent of the muropeptide composition being N-deacetylated [25] . We previously reported that a PGN N-deacetylase gene, pgdA, is responsible for this modification [25] . PGN deacetylation confers resistance to the action of lysozyme, one of the most important and widespread antimicrobial agents of the innate defense system, thus preventing degradation and release of immunostimulants.

In both cases, IFN-b induction was strongly reduced. Thus, internalization is critical for Listeriamediated IFN-b production. We also used dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor and chloroquine, which inhibits endosome acidification, and measured IFN-b induction in macrophages infected with EGDe or the DpgdA mutant ( Fig. 5B -C).

Both strains induced IkB expression and this required internalization as treatment with dynasore reduced the level of IkB induction (Fig. 7A) . Degradation of the IkB protein was examined in PEM infected with EGDe by immunoblot using anti-IkB antibodies. IkB level was reduced rapidly after infection of wild-type PEM (Fig. S2A ). In contrast, IkB degradation was not observed in tlr2 2/2 PEM infected with Listeria (Fig. S2B ). Infection of wild-type, tlr2 2/2 and trif 2/2 macrophages with EGDe or DpgdA showed that both TLR2 and the adaptor were required for full induction of IkB mRNA in response to EGDe and DpgdA strains (Fig. 7B) . These results suggest that TLR2 and TRIF contribute to NFkB activation. The comparison between EGDe and DpgdA strains showed that both caused similar magnitudes of IkB mRNA synthesis.

A DpgdA strain of L. monocytogenes which is unable to modify its PGN, was shown to be extremely sensitive to the bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme, normally found within macrophage vacuoles and its virulence was strongly attenuated [25] . Furthermore, this mutant induced a much higher TLR2dependent IFN-b response than the parental strain [25] . We hypothesised that this unconventional IFN-b response induced by the pgdA mutant was due to an enhanced accessibility of bacterial cell wall components to TLR2.

            "text": "It was surprising to see a role for TLR2, as, based on results in BMM and epithelial cells, type I IFNs production is usually not known to result from TLR2 signaling [5] [6] [7] [8] . Classical TLR2 signaling leads to NF-kB-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines [21] . However, in support of an unconventional role for TLR2, recent studies reported roles for TLR2-dependent induction of IFN-b in response to vaccinia virus or synthetic ligands [26, 29] . In the vaccinia virus study, a specific inflammatory monocyte population -Ly6C hi -was shown to be the source of IFNb [26] . In the present study we show that TLR2-dependent IFN-b synthesis is a property of both resident and recruited inflammatory PEM. Furthermore, the two previous studies documented that TLR2 activation of type I IFN responses to TLR ligands occurs within intracellular compartments, and that TLR2 signals from the phagosome in response to viral infection or synthetic TLR2 ligands [26, 29] . These results challenged the view that TLR2 signals solely from the plasma membrane. In our experiments, pretreatment of PEM with either cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization and thus internalization, dynasore, an inhibitor of the endocytic effector dynamin, or chloroquine, which inhibits endosome acidification [30, 31] , significantly impaired the induction of IFN-b following Listeria infection, strongly suggesting that phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes and intracellular location of TLR2 trigger this response. These observations also correlate with our early hypothesis that the inflammatory response induced by DpgdA is due to an enhanced release or accessibility of bacterial cell wall components to TLR2.",

            "text": "Induction of the IFN-b gene was independent of the TLR adapter Mal/TIRAP, but, unexpectedly required the TLR3/4 adapter TRIF. Francisella tularensis has recently been shown to signal through TLR2 from the phagosome in a Mal/TIRAP independent manner [32] , and it was shown that Mal/TIRAP is dispensable in TLR2 signaling at high concentrations of ligands [33] . Thus our study reinforces the view that TLR2 can act independently from Mal/TIRAP. In addition our report suggests a synergy between a TLR2 pathway and TRIF, an adapter previously known to trigger the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs upon engagement of TLR3 and TLR4. TLR3 is known to bind viral dsRNA to induce secretion of type I IFN and lead to control of viral infections [3, 34, 35] . To our knowledge Chlamydia muridarum is the only bacterium reported to induce a TLR3-dependent IFN-b response specifically in murine oviduct epithelial cells [36] . We tested whether the dual requirement for TLR2 and TRIF resulted from a functional or physical interaction between TLR2 and TLR3. In fact, IFN-b production was reduced in TLR3-deficient macrophages, but significantly less so than in trif2/2 PEM. Therefore, there is no evidence for a putative TLR2/TLR3 interaction. Another possibility to incorporate TRIF into the pathway stimulated in PEM by Listeria would be a cooperation of TLR2 and TLR4. This was ruled out by showing that Listeria-infected tlr4 2/2 PEM produced a similar amount of IFN-b as their wild-type counterparts. TRIF could possibly orchestrate an additional pathway. Along these lines, TRIF has recently been shown to be required for IFN-b synthesis by dendritic cells upon activation of the cytosolic receptor complex DDX1/DDX21/DDX36 by viral RNA [19] .",

We also assessed the involvement of NF-kB in this response using induction of the IkB gene as a readout. We observed an induction of IkB expression in macrophages which was similar after infection with EGDe or DpgdA. Thus, activation of NF-kB by Listeria is independent of PgdA, strongly suggesting that the elevated IFN-b production by the DpgdA mutant mostly relies on IRF3.",

As recent studies have highlighted novel DNA-sensing pathways in the induction of type I IFNs [9, [14] [15] [16] [17] 38] , we thus also investigated the involvement of bacterial nucleic acids in the IFN-b induction, Firstly, we showed that inactivation of PgdA, which confers a higher susceptibility to lysozyme, leads to increased release of DNA. We then showed that DNA from L. monocytogenes can induce IFN-b expression in PEM, suggesting that this macrophage population employs cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing similar to macrophages or macrophage lines derived from different anatomical locations [9, 38] . Which -if any-of the recently described nucleic acid sensors are used by PEM for the recognition of Listeria DNA remains subject to future investigation. Nevertheless, other bacterial components could participate in IFN-b production upon infection with the DpgdA mutant. For example, the second messenger molecule cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), was shown to be secreted by Listeria multidrug efflux pumps triggering type I IFN response [10] and could be involved in the process.",

In this regard cooperation between TLR2 and TRIF may reflect the need for convergence of the NF-kB and IRF pathways at the IFN-b promoter, with TLR2 being responsible mainly for NF-kB activation and TRIF being instrumental for activation of IRF3 and IRF7. By employing the strategy of PGN modification, L. monocytogenes can avoid immune detection by TLR and evade the innate immune response, thus enabling the infectious process to occur. It is important to recall that pgdA orthologs are found in other pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis and Helicobacter pylori, strongly suggesting that PGN N-deacetylation is a general mechanism evolved by microbes to escape from pattern recognition receptor-mediated immune recognition [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

The fragment was integrated into pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the construct was verified by sequencing. After digestion of the construct by BamHI, the fragment was purified on agarose gel and cloned into the integrative vector pPL2 [43] , previously digested by BamHI, constructing pOD98. The pOD98 was electroporated into DpgdA at 2,500 V, 200 V and 25 mF. Transformants were selected at 37uC on BHI agar containing chloramphenicol (7 mg/mL). The presence of the pgdA gene in the complemented strain was confirmed by PCR using oligonucleotides lmo0415-1 and lmo0415-2.",
