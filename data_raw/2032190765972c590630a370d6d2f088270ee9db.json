They prevent RNA from misfolding by loosening misfolded structures without ATP consumption. RNA chaperone activity is studied in vitro and in vivo using oligonucleotide-or ribozyme-based assays. Due to their functional as well as structural diversity, a common chaperoning mechanism or universal motif has not yet been identified. A growing database of proteins with RNA chaperone activity has been established based on evaluation of chaperone activity via the described assays. Although the exact mechanism is not yet understood, it is more and more believed that disordered regions within proteins play an important role. This possible mechanism and which proteins were found to possess RNA chaperone activity are discussed here.",

RNA molecules fulfill many different tasks such as coding and transfer of genetic information; they play regulatory functions in various cellular processes and catalyze chemical reactions (like cleavage and ligations). In addition to its functional versatility, RNAs are also able to fold into countless different structures, many of which have similar stabilities as the native structure and therefore compete with the native fold. Furthermore, RNA molecules often undergo transition states during their folding pathways before they reach the native and active structure. These transient structures can represent traps along the folding pathway from which the molecules might have a hard time to escape and which then end up being long-lived intermediates. The reason for this structural versatility is the fact that RNA consists of only four different bases which are easily capable of forming stable helices, that are not necessarily the native structure. The threshold for RNA molecules to be able to perform their functions is usually the accomplishment of reaching its native and active structure.",

The list of proteins with possible RNA chaperone activity is growing constantly. Proteins with different activities that support RNA folding are classified in this group. The definition of a protein with RNA chaperone activity is that the protein prevents RNA from misfolding by opening up misfolded structures. Proteins with RNA chaperone activity do not require ATP, which distinguishes them from RNA helicases, another group of proteins that facilitate RNA folding (e.g., Cyt-19) [2] . Proteins with RNA chaperone activity interact only transiently with RNA molecules and are supposed to be dispensable once the RNA has been folded correctly. This was shown for E. coli proteins S12 and StpA [3, 4] . A transient interaction and weak binding to RNA might be difficult to define because many of the identified RNA chaperones interact strongly with their target RNAs and are found in RNP complexes like ribosomal proteins, hnRNPs, La protein, and others. However, it has been demonstrated that a mutant StpA that shows stronger binding towards RNA shows decreased RNA chaperone activity suggesting that strong binding could also be detrimental to RNA folding [5] . In that way, proteins with RNA chaperone activity are also distinguished from \"stabilizers\" that are proteins that bind and stabilize an RNA structure and are required to stay bound in order to keep the RNA's native structure. Cyt-18, the tRNA synthetase from Neurospora crassa, is a \"stabilizer\" for the mitochondrial self-splicing group I intron: its presence is required to keep the native structure of the intron which otherwise unfolds readily.",

RNA basically encounters two folding problems: a kinetic folding problem, where the RNA molecule has to surmount kinetic barriers during the search for its native structure. Secondly, RNA molecules meet a thermodynamic folding problem as the final native structure often has to compete with alternative folds that have similar energetic stabilities [1] . RNA folding is a hierarchical process, and first secondary structure elements have to form. Secondary structural elements form between regions within the RNA molecule that are in close proximity. They are A-form helices consisting of Watson-Crick base-pairs. Secondary structures are very stable. The stability of a base-pair depends on the stability of both of its neighbouring base-pairs. Already any RNA of a reasonable length is able to form alternative base-pairs leading to alternative helices that become folding traps.",

They can also involve formation of helices. This is the case in pseudoknots where either a loop region interacts with a distant single stranded region or with another distant loop. Pseudoknots possess similar stability as secondary structures. But tertiary structural elements involve also other non-Watson-Crick interactions where for example, not only the Watson-Crick site of the nucleotide interacts with another nucleotide but also the Hoogsteen edge or the sugar edge of the nucleotide is involved in hydrogen bonding [8] . An often reoccurring tertiary structure motif is the A-minor interaction where an adenine interacts with the minor groove of the A-form helix [9] . Tertiary structures are often less stable and depend on the formation of secondary structures. Finally, monovalent or divalent metal ions play an important role in tertiary structure formation.",

The substrates in the in vitro assay (e.g., oligonucleotides) might differ in sequence requirements or structure requirements from possible native substrates and might lead to negative results. Strand unwinding assays might give positive results in the case of single-strand binding proteins. Furthermore, in vivo assays to measure RNA chaperone activity can be negatively influenced by possible toxicity of the putative RNA chaperone when overexpressed or can lead to secondary effects in the cell that give false positive results. Therefore, it is recommended to measure the RNA chaperone activity at least in more than one chaperone assay to be certain that no non-specific activity is measured. Figure 1) 3.1.1. Oligonucleotide Annealing. In this assay, two complementary oligonucleotides (oligos) present in concentrations above their dissociation constant are incubated together in the absence and in the presence of the protein to be evaluated for RNA chaperone activity. An increase in the rate of duplex formation is observed when the tested protein has RNA annealing activity. In principle two complementary short RNA oligos are used in this assay, although it has been a habit to choose DNA oligos instead. In order to measure RNA chaperone activity, however, I think that RNA oligonucleotides should be the preferred choice. Detection methods of duplex formation include native gel electrophoresis where the two complementary RNA strands can either be visualized by radioactive or fluorophor labelling and has been used in (besides many many other publications) [15] [16] [17] . RNA annealing can alternatively be measured by observing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon the closing up of the two fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides (e.g., see [18, 19] ).",

Therefore, this assay represents a suitable tool to study RNA chaperone activity upon folding of the hammerhead ribozyme-substrate construct. Using the hammerhead cleavage assay, both annealing and strand displacement can be studied independently of each other [3, 20] . The advantage on the well-studied assay is that depending whether singleturnover conditions or multiple turnover conditions are employed, it is possible to distinguish between annealing and strand dissociation activities. Using single-turnover conditions, where an excess of ribozyme and low concentrations of substrate are applied, substrate annealing is determined as substrate annealing becomes the rate limiting step. On the other hand, using multiple turnover conditions with an excess of substrate over ribozyme, the whole cleavage reaction is monitored consisting of annealing and product release. Since product release represents the rate limiting step, product dissociation is measured.",

Splicing of the group I intron within the thymidylate synthase gene of phage T4 occurs efficiently in vivo.

This is due to alternative base-pairing of exonic and intronic sequences which prevent the formation of the intron's native fold [12] . The mutant td precursor construct tdSH1 consists of an exonic stop codon and has an additional intronic point mutation (C865U) which further destabilizes the native intron structure. The tdSH1 construct is significantly impaired in splicing in vivo. Overexpression of RNA chaperones in the presence of the tdSH1 mutant is used to evaluate if the RNA chaperone is able to rescue the misfolded intron and restore splicing [23] .",

While the loosening effect is advantageous in wild type or misfolded introns, overexpression of StpA in the presence of introns that were already destabilized in their 3D structure was detrimental.

Furthermore, S12 significantly increased hammerhead ribozyme cleavage [3] . A systematic study on large ribosomal subunit proteins from E. coli showed that 1/3 of the tested proteins possesses strong RNA chaperone activity in vitro in the trans-splicing assay [21] . In addition, ribosomal protein L1 orthologs from eukarya, bacteria, and mesophilic archaea also exhibited strong transsplicing and cis-splicing activities in vitro [42] . Although it makes sense that the RNA chaperone activity of ribosomal proteins could play a role during ribosome assembly, a definite proof for the requirement of this activity in vivo has not yet been provided. Recently, it was demonstrated that E. coli ribosomal proteins L15, L16, L18, and L19, that showed RNA chaperone activity in vitro, further possess protein chaperone activity comparable to other protein chaperones such as Hsp90 [43] . It was suggested that intrinsically unstructured domains of ribosomal proteins could play a role in chaperoning. The exact mechanism, however, still remains elusive (see Section 5).",

PTB belongs to the IRES transacting factors (ITAFs), which are host factors (like La, hnRNP K, nucleolin, unr and many others) that interact with viral RNAs and induce conformational changes that then lead to translation initiation [53] . It was further reported that calcivirus replication requires PTB but only at lower or at higher temperatures than the permissive 37 \u2022 C, suggesting a chaperoning role of PTB [54] .

Many proteins with RNA chaperone activity are highly basic proteins and therefore interact readily with negatively charged RNA molecules. In that way, they might stabilize folded states by bringing together distant regions of the RNA molecule and as a consequence increase RNA double-strand formation.

For example, the E. coli protein StpA, which is found constitutively expressed in the bacterial cell, only shows its RNA chaperone activity in vivo when StpA is additionally over-expressed from an expression vector, thus showing that the cellular concentration of StpA is not sufficient to increase folding of the misfolded group I intron. Certainly, this observation might be due to the engagement of StpA in other regulatory functions in the bacterial cell; however, it also points to the direction that more than one molecule 8 Biochemistry Research International of StpA is required to assist folding of the td group I intron. As a consequence the question rises if and how it is possible to distinguish between RNA chaperone activity and a nonspecific single-strand RNA binding activity of the protein that might both prevent misfolding. Using the in vivo folding trap assay, however, not only proteins with possible RNA chaperone activity like StpA had been tested but also a viral single strand binding protein from Influenza virus (NP) was tested and did not show any increase in splicing suggesting that single strand RNA binding might not be sufficient for chaperoning. Furthermore, a detailed study on StpA wild type and mutants demonstrated that only the fulllength StpA was able to show RNA chaperone activity by simultaneously interacting with two RNA molecules [5] .",

In eukaryotes, for example, conservative estimations point out that 5%-15% of all proteins are completely disordered and 50% of the cellular proteins have at least long unstructured domains. An interesting study by Tompa and Csermely demonstrated that among chaperones a significantly high percentage of proteins show long unstructured regions [38] . Among RNA chaperones, the percentage of at least partially disordered proteins is even higher (54%) than in the group of protein chaperones (36.7%). Disordered proteins and protein segments allow a broad versatility for interaction partners and in this case for interaction with different RNA molecules. But it can also explain the ability of proteins with RNA chaperone activity to multitask as so far no RNA chaperone has been identified whose only task is to aid in RNA folding. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that some ribosomal proteins that possess RNA chaperone activity and contain disordered regions are also capable to chaperone protein folding suggesting once again that disordered regions provide high versatility for substrate interactions [43] .",
