A combination of as yet poorly understood host and viral factors combine to cause a minority of FCoV-infected cats to develop FIP. Clinicopathological features include fever, vasculitis, and serositis, with or without effusions; all of which indicate a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release. As a result, primary immune organs, as well as circulating leukocytes, have thus far been of most interest in previous studies to determine the likely sources of these cytokines. Results have suggested that these tissues alone may not be sufficient to induce the observed inflammation. The current study therefore focussed on the liver and heart, organs with a demonstrated ability to produce cytokines and therefore with huge potential to exacerbate inflammatory processes. The IL-12:IL-10 ratio, a marker of the immune system's inflammatory balance, was skewed towards the pro-inflammatory IL-12 in the liver of cats with FIP. Both organs were found to upregulate mRNA expression of the inflammatory triad of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in FIP. This amplifying step may be one of the missing links in the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease.",

In cats, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are the main mediators of the acute phase inflammatory response [8] and cats with FIP exhibit clear clinical and histological evidence of overt inflammatory processes. Despite this, there are conflicting results on the presence and systemic levels of these cytokines in FIP. Early studies found high IL-1 and IL-6 activity in sera, ascitic fluid, and the supernatant of cultured peritoneal exudate cells of cats with FIP [9,10]. However, IL-6 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were found to be unaltered, only mildly increased, or variable in FIP [11] [12] [13] , whilst IL-10 and IL-12 transcription was markedly depressed [11] .",

The disease presents clinically with recurrent fever and signs reflecting the In vitro transcriptome studies have also not shown these classical inflammatory mediators to be significantly altered between feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infected and uninfected cells; however, these have focussed on cell culture experiments using CRFK cells, so may not reflect the complex immune interactions in vivo [14, 15] . Additionally, CRFK cells are not primary immune cells so are unlikely to exhibit the same response. In vitro studies using peritoneal macrophages, a system that is closer to the disease scenario, provided evidence of the importance of TNF-\u03b1. FIPV induced TNF-\u03b1 production in infected cells; as TNF-\u03b1 can itself upregulate the type II FCoV receptor aminopeptidase N, cells may thus enhance their own infection rate [16, 17] . In turn TNF-\u03b1 functions as a possible contributor to the lymphocyte apoptosis observed in FIP [18, 19] . Despite this, in natural disease, end stage FIP is associated with only a low increase or in some cases even a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 transcription in the lymphatic tissues themselves [20, 21] . In conjunction, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 transcription showed no to low increases in the lymphatic tissues in FIP whilst IL-10 and IL-12 decreased or remained unchanged [20, 21] .",

We therefore first hypothesised a role for hepatocytes in cytokine production, as these have already been shown to be active in the disease. In cats with FIP, hepatocyte produced acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and in particular alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) have been shown to be elevated; to the extent that they are considered key elements of the diagnostic process [22] [23] [24] . Although not thus far studied in felines, human and murine hepatocytes have also been shown capable of producing cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Additionally, our group has previously identified constitutive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by feline cardiomyocytes, which increases in systemic inflammatory disease [31] . This led to the second hypothesis that the heart is an additional source of cytokines and thereby contributes to the systemic inflammatory status that allows FIP lesions to develop.",

All 1.1a cats were submitted for diagnostic post mortem examination with full owner consent. The 1.1b cats had been euthanased with FIP after experimental intra-peritoneal infection with the serotype I FCoV strain FIPV-UCD at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Approval for this experiment was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Utrecht University (approval number: 0502.0802). All Group 1.1b cats showed clinical signs of FIP which necessitated euthanasia of two cats at 3.5 and 4 weeks post infection (p.i.) whilst the remaining two were euthanased at the end of the experiment (11 weeks p.i.).",

All cats had tested positive for FCoV shedding and those euthanased more than 2 weeks p.i. seroconverted. All were confirmed to be systemically FCoV infected by the presence of a FCoV viraemia [34] . These cats were used as a comparison group to provide relatively uniform baseline cytokine level as pet cats without FIP would be subject to wide variations in terms of pathogen exposure, FCoV infection status, and concurrent disease. This also allowed evaluation of the effect of FIP on the animal rather than FCoV infection per se.",

Antibodies were raised against the C-terminus of the proteins by using 14 amino acid long synthetic peptides with an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminus coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier (see supplemental  Table S1 ).

Immunoblotting was also performed following routine protocols on a homogenised liver sample from an experimental FIP cat to confirm reaction with the 'native' protein.

Interestingly, when comparing natural and experimental FIP, the range of cytokine transcription extended higher in the natural cases. It is possible that the prior SPF status of the experimentally infected cats accounts for this as they would not have had previous exposure to FCoVs and/or other common infectious pathogens. They would also be at a more regulated stage of disease and received identical virus and dosage, likely explaining the lower variability of the results. This difference between groups, with higher levels in many of the natural cases, also supports the role of these organs in systemic inflammation generally rather than as a FCoV specific response.",

Immunohistological staining results did not allow an accurate quantification of translation, nor could we identify a direct correlation between mRNA and protein levels. This has a number of possible explanations-the different regions sampled, the different sensitivities of the two methods, the time lapse between transcription and translation (with our samples all taken at a single time point), and the manifold levels of pre-and post-translational regulation to which cytokines are exposed. Taking TNF-\u03b1 alone, there is regulation of mRNA at export, post-transcription, and translation, with multiple mechanisms at each stage [42] . However, our objective was to confirm rather than quantify parenchymal cytokine expression and, together with what is known of cytokine function, our results provide strong evidence that hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes may indeed play a role in systemic inflammatory disease and hence the pathogenesis of FIP. This is supported by data from a mouse study showing that hepatocytes can produce at least as much IL-6 per cell as macrophages [28] . Traditionally thought to have more of a reactive or even bystander role in disease, the parenchymal cells may in fact provide a large amplifying step in a cascade of cytokine release. This role is, however, secondary and rather unspecific, as systemic inflammatory diseases were found to be associated with myocardial transcription of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 at levels similar to those seen in cats with FIP. Whether other organs such as the lung (in which resident macrophages such as pulmonary intravascular macrophages may be targets for FCoV [43] ) also have a role to play remains to be investigated.",

Adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production by endothelial cells (EC) is induced by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, leading to leukocyte binding [45] . In line with this, upregulation of \u03b22-integrins was seen on leukocytes from cats with FIP [4, 46] .

In wet FIP, significant IL-6 activity has previously been reported in sera and peritoneal exudate cells [9] . The wet, dry, and mixed forms of FIP indicate overlapping disease states with a variable degree of vascular permeability [51, 52] . IL-6 can induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and pulmonary vascular permeability [53] [54] [55] , and the degree of ascites was found to be correlated with serum VEGF levels in cats with FIP [51] . This could explain, via VEGF upregulation, the particularly high hepatic IL-6 transcription levels seen in FIP cats with effusions in our study. Hepatic IL-6 release could also contribute to the progressive plasma cell infiltration seen in older FIP lesions [3, 41] , as IL-6 induces the final maturation of B cells into plasma cells [56] . It might also influence myocardial cytokine transcription, which showed a lower increase in FIP when compared to control cats than the liver samples and might therefore suggest a later, reactive involvement of the myocardium in the disease process. Showing a reactive response might also be the reason that no difference in myocardial transcription was observed between the effusive and non-effusive forms of FIP. However, further investigations into the time course of FIPV infection are needed.",

The similar IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA concentrations in the myocardium of young control cats and cats with FIP confirms our previous finding of a generally more reactive/inflammatory myocardium in young cats [35] , which might also contribute to the increased susceptibility of young cats to FIP, with TNF-\u03b1 subsequently further amplifying the inflammatory process. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits inflammatory cytokine transcription by monocytes, but also complements IL-6 as it can stimulate antibody production [58, 59] .

The pro-inflammatory effects of IL-12 are usually counteracted by IL-10 which attempts to return the immune response to homeostatic base levels [60] . The IL-12:IL-10 ratio has been used as a measure of the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory states in a number of disease conditions [61] . In our study we found an overall higher hepatic IL-12:IL-10 mRNA ratio in FIP than in healthy FCoV-infected cats. Despite being archetypally pro-inflammatory, at high concentrations IL-12 can inhibit the immune response and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [62, 63] . In contrast to the liver, the mesenteric lymph nodes were previously found to downregulate IL-12 transcription in FIP, with IL-10 levels unaffected [20, 21] . It would appear that neither high IL-12 nor high IL-10 are themselves protective and indeed plasmids encoding IL-12 have been found to enhance susceptibility to disease in FIPV vaccination studies, rather than offering protection as had been predicted [64] .",
