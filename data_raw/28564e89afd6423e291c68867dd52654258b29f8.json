In this perspective, we evaluate the possibility of integration of global omics-data in order to timely prepare for pandemics. Such an approach requires two major innovations. First, data that is obtained should be shared with the global community instantly. The strength of rapid integration of simple signals is exemplified by Google's TM Flu Trend, which could predict the incidence of influenza-like illness based on online search engine queries. Second, omics technologies need to be fast and high-throughput. We postulate that analysis of the exhaled breath would be a simple, rapid and non-invasive alternative. Breath contains hundreds of volatile organic compounds that are altered by infection and inflammation.The molecular fingerprint of breath (breathprint) can be obtained using an electronic nose, which relies on sensor technology. These breathprints can be stored in an online database (a \"breathcloud\") and coupled to clinical data. Comparison of the breathprint of a suspected subject to the breathcloud allows for a rapid decision on the presence or absence of a pathogen.",

Novel emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases could increase the number of victims substantially, as exemplified by the approximately 50 million deaths in the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918 -1919 (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006 . Subsequent influenza pandemics and the emergence of novel animal-origin influenza (H5N1, H7N9) and coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that cause severe infections in humans illustrate a continuous and ongoing threat of new pandemics. Intensive farming and changing climate enhance the likelihood of (zoonotic) transmission of animal-origin pathogens to humans and subsequent evolution of such pathogens to efficient infection of -and transmission between humans. Globalization, migrations and intensive tourism further increase the chance of rapid spread of such agents (Jones et al., 2008) .",

A system that obliges clinicians to report new cases of severe respiratory viral infections, called the public health response, is available for the clinical suspicion of specific pathogens but this requires a pro-active effort of doctors. Automated integration of test results through an online platform would allow for real-time surveillance. This approach is nicely illustrated by \"Flu Trend\" in Google TM (http://www.google.org/flutrends/). Using online search engine query data such as \"influenza complication\" and \"flu remedy,\" Google TM is able to detect epidemics of respiratory viruses (Ginsberg et al., 2009) . This method could predict the incidence of influenza-like illness 1 week before the Center of Disease Control (Ginsberg et al., 2009) . However, as the input data for this model are not specific for influenza infection, this tool is helpful for influenza-like illness but probably not sufficient for monitoring the spread of a specific strain of the influenza virus. To capture this complexity, more specific viral signals should be investigated.",

            "text": "Search engine queries rely on the phenotypic presentation of people with symptoms of influenza-like illnesses. Symptoms are non-specific results of physiological, cellular and molecular changes in the body that occur during viral infection. Systems biology aims to integrate the signals from all these levels into an understanding of the complete system (Josset et al., 2013) . Following this philosophy, several \"omics\" technologies have been developed to measure the molecular landscape in an integrative fashion within one domain. \"Genomics\" can be used to study genetic risk factors for disease susceptibility of the host (Keynan et al., 2013) and for understanding of the pathogenicity of the pathogen in this context (Kash, 2009 ). Analysis of mRNA using \"transcriptomics\" potentially allows for simultaneous measurement of the expression of 10s of 1000s genes. Transcription research allows for rapid testing (e.g., in the order of hours) and provides more information on functionality than genomics alone. However, proteins are ultimately responsible for the function of cells. \"Proteomics\" has therefore the potential to uncover important interactions between the virus and the host. Studies show that influenza induces rapid changes in the host transcriptome and proteome Pommerenke et al., 2012) , as soon as 1 h after infection (Cheung et al., 2012) . These very early temporal changes after infection are also observed at the metabolite level (Lin et al., 2012) . \"Metabolomics\" is \"the global assessment of endogenous metabolites within a biologic system and represents a snapshot-reading of gene function, enzyme activity and the physiological landscape\" (Serkova et al., 2011) . Treatment of influenza induces many metabolic changes that can be traced back to specific pathways (Lu et al., 2012) .",

VOC-patterns identified by smell have been used to diagnose disease and intoxication for ages (e.g., scent of acetone in uncontrolled diabetes; Manolis, 1983) . Thus, influenza diagnosis based on exhaled breath analysis could take two forms: detection of aerosols with viral RNA, or an influenza-specific VOC-patterns.",

            "text": "So far, both these methods have relied on relatively timeconsuming methods, RT-PCR and gas-chromatography coupled to mass-spectrometry, respectively. Rapid technological innovation in sensors, however, allows for detection of these signals using re-usable, rapid and easy nanosensor arrays. For example, a silicon nano-wire sensor device would allow influenza detection in half the time of RT-PCR in the clinical setting (Shen et al., 2012) . Devices using sensor-based detection of VOCs are called \"electronic noses,\" following their apparent similarities to olfaction (R\u00f6ck et al., 2008) . Electronic noses integratively capture complex VOC mixtures using an array of different sensors (R\u00f6ck et al., 2008) . Sensors have individual sensitivities and specificities for multiple VOCs. The composite signal of all sensors can be analyzed using pattern-recognition algorithms. Electronic nose analysis of breath results in a unique fingerprints of exhaled metabolites, called \"breath-prints.\" This allows rapid identification, recognition and comparison of VOC mixtures. Thereby, these breath-prints can be used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes, which do not require identification of individual molecular constituents. Breath-prints have found to be different in a wide range of respiratory diseases (Hockstein et al., 2005; Machado et al., 2005; Fens et al., 2009 Fens et al., , 2010 .",

However, we can look at other applications to glance at the possibilities for global monitoring using this technology. In the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with 10 km \u00d7 10 km one of the largest ports in the world, odor nuisance is a major problem. 30 metal oxide sensor based electronic noses were installed throughout the portal area, to monitor odor emissions in order to timely prevent nuisance (Bootsma and Milan, 2010; Milan et al., 2012) . After a training period in which sensors were learned to recognize \"malodor,\" the electronic noses were able to recognize more than 90% of the reported odor complaints in advance. Based on comparison between fingerprints of the recognized odor and an online database of previous events (an \"odor-cloud,\" in line with the popular expression for an online virtual server application) the most probable chemical characteristics of the scent can be estimated (Apostulou, 2012) . Combined with the temporal findings in different sensors and the direction and speed of the wind, the most probable source of pollution can be identified (Figure 1) . This approach has allowed for prevention of the development of odor nuisance and environmental pollution by refineries, but also passing cargo ships. ",

            "text": "The parallels between monitoring of the spread of malodor in industrialized areas and of viral infections are striking. In both situations, the timing of the event is unknown, which requires continuous surveillance, and source identification is necessary for early intervention. In the case of exhaled breath analysis, the source cannot be identified with the direction of the wind, but by movement of hosts or patient populations. Therefore, we postulate that exhaled breath tests can best be positioned in places where large groups of people assemble for traveling. One could think of airports, train stations or border control. Here, a very sensitive test may identify infected individuals who are to contribute to the global spread of the pathogen. Importantly, the technique should be high-throughput and the result should be available instantaneously. Thus, in line with environmental surveillance, exhaled breath analysis of patients would allow for the construction of an online database with previously observed breath-prints (a \"breath-cloud\"; Figure 2) . Linked with the clinical characteristics of these patients, an exhaled breath pattern for influenza infection can be identified and subsequently used for characterization of new patients. When the clinical information of these patients is known, the breath-cloud can be updated and identification can be improved, allowing for repeated, cyclic improvement of the diagnostic algorithm. There are important differences in the type and concentration of VOCs in environmental and breath analysis. In the environment, the molecules of interest are mostly present in parts-per-million concentration, in contrast to 10s to 100s parts-per-billion in breath. This means that sensors for breath monitoring need to be more sensitive. The VOCs of interest are mostly sulfur-containing and cyclic compounds in studies on maladour but breath research is not limited to those. Therefore it is anticipated that the sensor array ought to be larger and more versatile in breath analysis.",
