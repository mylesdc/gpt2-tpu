In other words, the spatial distribution of infection results from the routine mobility patterns of susceptible and infectious individuals rather than, say, from susceptible individuals visiting non-mobile infectious individuals. We also assume that all individuals experience the same frequency and intensity of interactions, regardless of factors such as age.",

This highlights the role that mildly-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can play in the population experience of infection, especially since they are likely to adhere to their regular routines and their routine hygiene practices.",
