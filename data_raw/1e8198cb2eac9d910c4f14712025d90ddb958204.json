Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of na\u00efve animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission. and virus isolation [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Serologic studies suggest that MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for at least three decades in regions as wide ranging as the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa [16] . The outbreak among human populations has persisted-albeit in low numbers-despite a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission [17, 18] . Data from molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that the outbreak has endured through multiple zoonotic spillover events from dromedary camels to humans. Additionally, several studies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have demonstrated a clear epidemiologic link between camel and human populations [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Dromedary camels have been identified as the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV through multiple studies that have employed combinations of diagnostic platforms, to include serology, molecular detection of viral RNA, DNA expression vectors were produced encoding the S1 portion of the Spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV England1 strain (strain England1, GenBank ID: AFY13307) (Figure 1 ). Sequences were reverse-translated and codon-optimized for human cell expression as described [28] . Proteins were produced by transfecting Expi293 cells with the mammalian expression vector VRC8400 expressing the codon-optimized S1 gene.

St. Louis, MO, USA) to complete a 0, 4-, and 15-week immunization schedule ( Figure 1B ). Serum from vaccinated animals was collected and evaluated by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012 ( Figure 1C ). On day 28 after priming vaccination, low levels of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected in two of three the camels (virus neutralizing titers of 1:40, 1:10, and <10 respectively; Figure 1C ). The day 28 boost did not result in an increase in neutralizing titers in the PRNT assay and neutralizing titers decreased between the second and third boost. The third immunization resulted in a quick increase in neutralizing titer in the two camels that responded to the vaccine; neutralizing titers were high in these two camels by the time of challenge. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in CA3 (<1:10) at any point during the experiment ( Figure 1C) . A stronger neutralizing response was observed in the alpaca after vaccination, with virus neutralizing titers of 1:640 and 1:40 four weeks after the initial vaccination to end titers of 1:2560 and 1:640 at the time of challenge ( Figure 1C ).",

The two vaccinated camels with a detectable humoral immune response (CA1 and CA2) exhibited reduced viral shedding through 4 dpi. At 5 dpi, there were no differences in MERS-CoV titers measured in nasal swabs between vaccinated and control camels. The vaccinated camel without detectable neutralizing antibody titers (CA3) did not shed virus on 1 dpi but otherwise exhibited virus shedding kinetics that were similar to those of unvaccinated controls. Overall, infectious MERS-CoV titers in nasal swabs differed statistically significantly between vaccinated and unvaccinated camels on 1 and 3 dpi (p < 0.05). In contrast to the camels, vaccination of alpaca resulted in complete protection from MERS-CoV shedding. No infectious virus was detected in the nasal swabs collected from the vaccinated alpaca (A1, A2), while infectious virus was detected in unvaccinated alpaca every day until necropsy at 5 dpi ( Figure 2B ). Infectious virus was detected in the nasal turbinates, larynx, and trachea of all unvaccinated camels ( Figure 3A) , confirming that the virus stock prepared for challenge resulted in productive infection. Additionally, infectious virus was detected in 1 of 4 lung lobes of CA6.

The non-responsive vaccinated camel, CA3, and control CA4 displayed a minimal-to-mild multifocal acute tracheitis, as evidenced by a loss of individual epithelial cells and cell polarity. Necrosis and infiltration of the epithelium by small numbers of neutrophils were observed. None of the camels showed pathological changes in the lower respiratory tract ( Figure 4B,C,H,I) . Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated the presence of MERS-CoV antigen in the epithelial cells of the nasal turbinates of CA1-5 ( Figure 4D,J) . Viral antigen was also detected in the tracheal epithelial cells of CA3 and CA4, but not in CA1 or CA2 ( Figure 4E ). Similar to the camels, the unvaccinated alpaca displayed a multifocal, minimal-to-mild, acute rhinitis ( Figure 5G ) with loss of cilia and cellular polarity, occasional necrotic epithelial cells admixed with small numbers of neutrophils, and rare erosions of respiratory epithelium. The subjacent submucosa was infiltrated by small-to-moderate numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells with fewer macrophages and neutrophils. IHC confirmed the presence of MERS-CoV antigen within the epithelial cells of the nasal turbinates of these control alpaca ( Figure 5J ). No histopathological changes or MERS-CoV antigen were detected in any of the vaccinated alpaca ( Figure 5G-L) .

            "text": "This study highlights several important issues to consider when developing a dromedary camel vaccine against MERS-CoV. First of all, virus shedding was reduced, but not completely absent in the presence of antibodies in dromedary camels after vaccination. However, virus replication in vaccinated animals was largely confined to the nasal turbinates, whereas the MERS-CoV replication in unvaccinated animals extended deeper down the respiratory tract into the trachea. In a study using intranasal administration of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara virus vector vaccine expressing full length Spike protein, delayed shedding was also observed in one of the vaccinated dromedary camels [35] . After vaccination, low neutralizing antibody titers were detected in the upper respiratory tract. The apparent low neutralizing capacity of the upper respiratory tract combined with continuous exposure to MERS-CoV (from co-housed animals) could potentially deplete the neutralizing capacity by scavenging the available neutralizing antibodies until the neutralizing capacity is sufficiently reduced to allow for virus replication. Therefore, vaccine platforms aimed specifically at inducing high levels of mucosal immunity or those that induce humoral as well as cellular immunity may be required for complete protection. In-depth studies to determine the correlates of protection in dromedary camels would aid the development of better-targeted vaccines, especially the correlation of levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum vs. protection against MERS-CoV in the upper respiratory tract. Second, the response to vaccination in dromedary camels varies widely, as one out of three camels in the present study did not respond to vaccination at all. This camel was a ten-year-old male, housed in a pen adjacent to a mature female. Most of the vaccination schedule coincided with the mating period of this camel. Thus, it is possible, though unclear, that reproductive status impacted the camel's immune response. Variable neutralizing responses after MERS-CoV vaccination have been reported in a previous dromedary camel vaccine study. One animal in a group of three failed to mount a detectable neutralizing response after vaccination with a DNA vaccine expressing full length Spike protein [36] . Vaccine development efforts should thus focus on vaccine platforms that uniformly induce immunity in dromedary camels. Finally, intranasal challenge with MERS-CoV yielded distinctly different outcomes in the alpaca and dromedary camels. Upon viral challenge, both immunized alpaca were completely protected from MERS-CoV infection. Thus, although alpaca are an attractive alternative experimental model to dromedary camels since MERS-CoV replication dynamics in alpaca appear to be similar to those in dromedary camels [29, 37] but alpaca are easier to obtain and house, vaccine efficacy ultimately has to be confirmed in the dromedary camel model.",
