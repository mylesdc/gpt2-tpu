            "text": "Background. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the acute clinical manifestations represent acute on chronic inflammation. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is found in the granules of human neutrophils, with many diverse functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the inflammatory process in various stages of coronary artery disease. Methods. We studied 140 patients, with SA 40, UA 35, NSTEMI 40, and STEMI 25, and 20 healthy controls. Serum NGAL was measured upon admission and before coronary angiography. Results. Significant differences were observed in median serum-NGAL(ng/mL) between patients with SA (79.23 (IQR, 37.50-100.32)), when compared with UA (108.00 (68.34-177.59)), NSTEMI (166.49 (109.24-247.20)), and STEMI (178.63 (111.18-305.92)) patients and controls (50.31 (44.30-69.78)) with significant incremental value from SA to STEMI. We observed a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP (spearman coefficient rho = 0.685, P < 0.0001) as well as with neutrophil counts (r = 0.511, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. In patients with coronary artery disease serum levels of NGAL increase and reflect the degree of inflammatory process. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, serum levels of NGAL have high negative predictive value and reflecting the inflammatory status could show the severity of coronary clinical syndrome.",

Plaque rupture with the formation of an occlusive thrombus is the cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [2] . Inflammatory cells, involving activated neutrophils, are more frequently found in plaques vulnerable to rupture [3] . Neutrophil activation has been reported in unstable angina (UA) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but not in patients with stable angina (SA) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .

The relevance of NGAL to cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains primarily unknown. Elevated plasma NGAL levels were associated with atherosclerosis and were implicated as a predictor for cardiovascular mortality after cerebrovascular ischemia, possibly because of activation of blood leukocytes [18] [19] [20] . Although in recent reports has been shown that NGAL is present in atherosclerotic plaques and in human abdominal aortic aneurisms, raising the possibility that expression of NGAL can be induced in vascular cells during atherogenesis, the underlying mechanism for the induction of NGAL in vascular cells remains unknown [15, 21] . In further analysis the main source of NGAL was found to be neutrophils, probably recruited in the vascular wall by platelet activation [21] .",

This view is further supported by the observation that similar neutrophil NGAL/MMP-9 overexpression can be found in atherosclerotic plaques, particularly those with intramural haemorrhagic debris and central necrosis [15, 22] . The above evidence supports the clinical observations that highcirculating leucocyte (particularly neutrophil) counts are independent predictors of recurrent ischaemic attacks. This may be explained by their presence in the necrotic core of unstable plaques and by their proteolytic activity towards atherosclerotic tissue and secondary mobilization of thromboembolic fragments [23] . The evidence derived from these experimental studies, showing the close link between neutrophils, their products and the natural history of atherosclerosis, and its complications, generated clinical studies that investigated the clinical utility of serum-NGAL measurements.",

Our data agree with these reports since we found that levels of serum-NGAL are significantly higher in patients with all clinical syndromes of CAD than in healthy controls, reinforcing the utility of NGAL as biomarker of detection and the extent of CAD. The expression of NGAL from vascular cells during atherogenesis can also explain the differences between patients with SA and control subjects with no risk factors observed in our study. In addition to its induction in the vessels after mechanistic injury, previous studies suggest that NGAL is strongly upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and also in the heart after ischemic injury [15] .

As far as the gradual increase of serum-NGAL, according to the seriousness of unstable coronary clinical syndrome, this could reflect the intensity of the inflammatory reaction, as it is expressed by the incremental increase of hs-CRP and neutrophil count and their combination with serum NGAL. Especially between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP, the correlation is linear and positive.",

Correlations were determined with use of Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient. Chi-square statistics were used for categorical variables. A P value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered to indicate statistical significance. Data are reported as medians and interquartile ranges. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and define cutoff points. Cutoff values were chosen after cost-benefit analysis. Differences between AUCs were investigated with the non-parametric approach of DeLong, DeLong and Clarke-Pearson. Statistics were performed with the NCSS 2004 Statistical and Power Analysis Software (NCSS Inc, Kaysville, UT, USA).",
