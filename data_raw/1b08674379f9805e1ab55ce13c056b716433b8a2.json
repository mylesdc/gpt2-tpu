In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.",

In this study, we introduce a new approach which combines different types of data to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. This approach relies on representing each type of data (e.g. temporal, spatial, or genetic) as a graph where nodes are cases, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding cases are closely related for this data. Our method then identifies clusters of cases which likely stem from the same introduction. Furthermore, we can use the size of these clusters to infer transmissibility of the disease and the number of importations of the pathogen into the population. We apply this approach to analyse dog rabies epidemics in Central African Republic. We show that outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex and computationally intensive approaches. Using simulated rabies epidemics, we show that our method has excellent potential for optimally detecting outbreak clusters. We also identify promising areas of research for transforming our method into a routine analysis tool for processing disease surveillance data.",

Indeed, early assessment of the relative contributions of local transmission versus case importation is essential for designing appropriate intervention strategies. For instance, a nosocomial outbreak may be driven by within-hospital transmissions or repeated introductions from the community, calling for different control measures [6, 7] . Similarly at a country level, local transmissions and importations of cases from other countries will require different control measures, e.g. social distancing and prevention versus border closing [8, 9] . In the case of zoonotic infections, it is also crucial to identify the extent to which within-species transmission and spill-over from the reservoir (i.e. cross-species transmission) contribute to the observed incidence, as illustrated in the case of avian influenza [10, 11] , bovine tuberculosis [12] , or MERS [3, 8, 9] .",

            "text": "Methodologically, the identification of clusters of cases linked by transmission (i.e. cases belonging to the same transmission tree or stemming from a single introduction, here referred to as 'outbreak clusters') is strongly related to other fields which have received considerable attention from statisticians and modellers over the last decades. First, it is closely linked to outbreak detection methods, which generally aim to identify excesses of cases compared to a reference 'baseline' in incidence time series [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and are for instance routinely used to detect the beginning of seasonal influenza epidemics from surveillance data [20] [21] [22] . Some extensions to spatiotemporal data [23] [24] [25] [26] have shown geographic information can be a useful complement to temporal data [27, 28] , but little efforts have been devoted to generalising these approaches to other types of data such as pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS). Second, the identification of outbreak clusters is also closely related to outbreak reconstruction methods, which infer transmission chains using complex outbreak models integrating multiple MR/K010174/1 and MR/R015600/1, https://mrc. ukri.org, https://www.gov.uk/government/ organisations/department-for-internationaldevelopment).

This evidence synthesis approach can combine various data streams such as the timing and location of the cases, as well as WGS of the pathogen, to identify such outbreak clusters. Our method relies on the observation that, in an outbreak, individuals who infect one another are likely to be closely related with respect to various characteristics; for instance, their symptom onsets appear within the same time period and in neighbouring locations, and they bear genetically similar pathogen strains. We consider that, to be part of the same outbreak cluster, two cases must be closely related in all relevant data streams. These data sources describe relationships between cases in intrinsically different spaces (e.g., temporal, spatial, genetic), but they can all be used to compute pairwise distances between cases (e.g. number of days between dates of onset, geographic distance between locations, number of mutations between pathogen WGS). We define, for each data stream, a weighted graph, where nodes correspond to cases, and the edge between two cases is weighted by the pairwise distance (for this data stream) between these two cases, so that 'heavy' edges indicate pairs of cases unlikely to have infected one another. To retain only relevant connections, each graph is then pruned by removing heavy edges, defined as edges whose weight exceeds a predefined cutoff distance (Fig 1) . Schematic illustration of our graph approach for combining multiple data streams to identify outbreak clusters. In this example, two data streams are considered: the spatial locations of the cases (A) and a phylogeny of pathogens from these cases (D). The three 'actual' outbreak clusters are identified in red, blue and green, using different shadings to identify individual cases. Each data source defines a fully connected graph where nodes represent cases and edges are weighted by the spatial (B) and genetic distances (E). Thicker edges represent smaller weights (distances) between cases. Each graph is then pruned separately, removing edges whose weight exceeds a given cutoff (C, F). The intersection of these graphs defines a new graph which retains only edges present in every pruned graph (G). The resulting clusters of cases indicate likely outbreak clusters.",

We develop a framework for defining cutoffs based on the expected distance distributions between observed cases in an outbreak. This enables us to incorporate pre-existing information about the disease, e.g. the distribution of its serial interval (the time between symptoms onset in a case and its infector), its spatial kernel (the distribution of geographical distances between a case and its infector), and its mutation rate. Typically, such information is available for fully observed outbreaks, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. To address this issue, our approach also accounts for underreporting. We give a general solution to the expected distances between observed cases for a given level of reporting (i.e. fraction of observed cases), as well as some analytical results for common distributions used to describe distances between cases in time (the serial interval), space (the spatial kernel), and for genetic distances (the molecular clock).",

Importantly, the sizes of the clusters also contain information about the underlying transmissibility [8] .

Rabies is an important and complex neglected zoonosis mainly transmitted to humans by dogs [40, 41] . Campaigns to eliminate canine rabies through the vaccination of dogs, the treatment of all potential human rabies exposures, and the improvement of education about rabies prevention are ongoing but are in many low and middle income countries of limited impact due to the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the disease [42] . In Bangui, the dynamics of rabies is likely relying on a combination of local transmission, i.e. between dogs within the city, and importations, i.e. rabid dogs entering the city from neighbouring locations, therefore providing an interesting model for a proof of concept of our approach [39] . Characterising such dynamics, and in particular the relative importance of local transmission versus importations would be critical to implementing effective control strategies. If local transmission dominates the dynamics, then mass vaccination could be sufficient for control. However, if the repeated importations dominate the dynamics, restricting these and focusing on finding and vaccinating the external 'source(s)' of infections would be more efficient.",

Of these, 123 cases had a date of report available, as well as a geographical location and viral genome sequences (Fig 2) . Pairwise distances between these 123 cases are shown in Fig 3, separately for temporal, spatial, and genetic distances. The distribution of spatial distances was unimodal, with an average pairwise The top left panel shows the incidence of reported cases of rabies over time, by date of report; cases identified as belonging to the same outbreak cluster (using all distances) are shown in the same colour (grey indicates singletons). The top right panel shows the geographic distance of 3.9km. In contrast, the distribution of temporal distances exhibited two peaks, one at very short time differences, and one around 4 years, likely driven by the multiple peaks in the observed incidence time series (see Fig 2) . The distribution of genetic distances was multimodal (as expected from the phylogeny in Fig 2) , with a main mode at 4 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and the presence of distinct lineages shown by some sequences differing by over 700 SNPs. Fig 3 shows , overlaid onto the observed pairwise distances, the distributions for the expected distances (in time, space or genetic) between a case and its closest observed ancestor based on the literature and given an assumed reporting rate of 20% [39] . The equivalent distributions with no underreporting, i.e. the distributions of expected distances between a case of rabies and its infector are shown in S1 Fig. Based on these input distributions, we defined cutoffs for each data stream corresponding to the 95% quantiles (90 and 98% quantiles were also considered in sensitivity analyses, see S1 Text). The observed temporal, geographic, and genetic distances were combined with the input cutoffs to produce pruned graphs for each data stream (Fig 4A-4C ). These graphs were in turn intersected to produce the final graph whose connected components are clusters of cases connected in all dimensions, therefore representing cases likely linked by transmission ( Fig 4D) .",

The estimated reproduction number was 0.92 (95% confidence interval CI 95% : [0.85; 1.01]) and the estimated rate of importation of rabies into the population was 4.91 (CI 95% : [3.60; 6.65]) importations per year (see Table 1 ).",

In our main analysis of simulated datasets aiming to reproduce the Bangui epidemiological situation, the mean sensitivity (measured as the True Positive Rate, TPR, see materials and method) was 99.3% with a mean specificity (measured as the True Negative Rate, TNR) of 99.7%. The corresponding median relative error in the estimated parameters was low, at -2.5% for the reproduction number and -0.8% for the importation rate (see S1 Text for more results). These results were obtained assuming the same reporting rate as in the simulation, and with a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distributions. Using higher quantiles generally led to a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity. The average between sensitivity and specificity was very high for all but the highest cutoff considered (99.9% quantile), and was maximal for the 95% quantile (S12 and S13 Figs). Misspecifying the reporting rate led to lower performances: underestimating and overestimating the reporting rate were associated respectively with lower specificity and lower sensitivity (Fig 5A) . In other simulation scenarios with different reporting rates, using the 95% quantile for pruning led to good although slightly poorer performance, with a mean average between sensitivity and specificity greater than 82%.

Our study used temporal, spatial and genetic data to detect outbreak clusters, but there is no theoretical limit to the number and nature of data sources, as long as the data can be used to compute a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of cases. Unlike previous approaches [38] , our method also exploits preexisting information on the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate, to define whether cases are part of the same outbreak cluster or not. Our method will therefore be particularly useful to understand transmission patterns for known pathogens, for which the natural history, transmission characteristics and evolutionary rates are well described in the literature. On the other hand, non-parametric approaches such as that described in Ypma et al. [38] , which make no assumption about the underlying pathogen, may be better suited to the analysis of data on emerging, poorly characterised pathogens. Note however that the performance of the method described in Ypma et al. [38] has only been tested on data simulated using an extremely simple and unrealistic evolutionary model, with at least 80% reported cases. In contrast, our approach explicitly accounts for underreporting, and was tested on more realistic epidemic scenarios, with reporting rates as low as 10%. This makes our method more widely applicable in real-life epidemic investigations, in which fully observed transmission chains are rare.",

In our rabies application, we used cutoffs corresponding to the 95% quantiles, identified in our simulation study as maximising the average between sensitivity and specificity (S12 and S13 Figs). In practice, optimal cutoffs will likely vary across datasets, diseases and epidemic contexts. Different strategies may be employed to address the issue. First, sensitivity analyses should be performed to study the impact of changing the cutoffs and reporting rates, as has been done here. Second, whenever possible, simulations can be used to identify optimal cutoffs for a specific outbreak context.

Our approach could use any measure of social [43] [44] [45] or ecological distances [46] , as well as measures of dissimilarity based on reported symptoms (e.g. proportion of different symptoms reported by a pair of cases). Whenever deep sequencing data is available, existing measures of the genetic differentiation between populations can also readily be applied to describe genetic distances between individuals whilst accounting for within-host diversity [47] [48] [49] [50] . An additional advantage of our approach for data integration is that it does not formally require different data streams to be independent.

For the temporal data stream, we define the distance between two cases as the delay between a specific clinical event (typically symptoms, but could be anything else) in the two cases. For the spatial data stream, we consider the Euclidean distance between the locations of each pair of cases (e.g. the location of their home but again could be defined differently). Finally, for genetic data, we measure the distance between two cases as the Hamming distance, defined as the number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between the pair of considered sequences.",

The choice of the cutoff \u03ba n for each data stream will dramatically influence the number of edges retained through the pruning process, and in turn the size of the clusters derived by our method. Here, we consider the case where the pathogen of interest is already known, or where existing case-investigation data exist, so that preexisting information on the distribution of expected distances between cases can be used as input to inform the cutoff choice. If f n denotes the input probability density function or probability mass function of expected distances between a case and its infector for data stream n, the cutoff \u03ba n for that data stream could then be defined as a predetermined quantile of f n , for instance the 95% quantile. With this approach, two cases would be considered disconnected with respect to data stream n (after the pruning step), if the distance between them d n i,j is larger than the 95% quantile of the input distribution f n . Note that, when several independent data sources are combined, the quantile could be chosen to ensure a certain sensitivity. For instance in our application with 3 data streams, a quantile of 95% 1/3 \ufffd 98% in each of the 3 data streams would lead to an overall sensitivity of 95%. Note however that this assumes independence between all data streams, which in practice would rarely be the case. For instance, if a secondary case arises soon after a primary case, it is likely to also be close to the primary case in geographical and genetic space. In the presence of such correlations, the resulting sensitivity is likely to be larger than 95%.",

Such underreporting will directly affect the distances between observed cases, with more underreporting leading to larger distances. For instance, for the temporal data stream, the delay between symptom onset in a case and its closest observed ancestor is typically longer as underreporting, and hence the number of unobserved intermediate cases, increases. If the overall reporting probability, \u03c0, is known, and assuming that the probability of being reported is identical for all cases, the number of unobserved intermediate cases between two observed cases can be described by a geometric distribution with probability \u03c0. Using this property, we propose, in that case, to define the cutoff \u03ba n as a quantile of f n,\u03c0 , the distribution of the expected distance between an observed case and its closest observed ancestor, accounting for potential unobserved intermediate cases. The formula to derive f n,\u03c0 is presented and explained in S1 Text. Note that if all cases are observed i.e. \u03c0 = 100%, then f n,\u03c0 = f n , as in the previous section.",

For the input distributions f n , we consider specific parametric distributions that are particularly appropriate to describe these three data streams and allow us to derive an analytical formulation for f n,\u03c0 , in the presence of underreporting (S1 Text). We use Gamma, Rayleigh, and Poisson distributions for f n for temporal, spatial and genetic distances respectively. For each of these cases, we provide analytical formulas for f n,\u03c0 , the input probability density function or probability mass function of the distance between two cases, accounting for underreporting.

Here we assume that the number of secondary cases (or 'offsprings') follows a Poisson distribution with mean R. Intuitively, the final size (i.e. the total number of cases once extinction has occurred) of an outbreak seeded with one infected individual, is related to R. Numerous studies have characterised this relationship and provided formulations to estimate the reproduction number from the final size of naturally extinct outbreaks [8, 63] . We built on such methods to account for underreporting (see S1 Text). Assuming unobserved cases are distributed at random across the outbreaks, this approach adjusts the likelihood of an observed outbreak final size by integrating over all possible unobserved cases in that outbreak. Importantly, this method also accounts for the possibility for some, typically small outbreaks, to go entirely unobserved. The method estimates R, as well as the probability of observing an outbreak, P obs . An estimate of the number of unobserved outbreaks may then be obtained assuming that it follows a negative binomial distribution characterised by P obs and the number of observed outbreaks. A full description of the inference on both the reproduction number and the number of importations can be found in S1 Text.

RNA extractions, RT-PCR and sequencing were performed as described previously [39] . 42% of the viral genome was sequenced, including the N, P, M, G and intergenic G-L region, corresponding to positions 161 to 5,221 of the RABV genome [67] . All 151 sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE [68] plugin for Geneious 5.6.6 (Biomatters).",

Information on the distributions of expected distances between rabies cases was retrieved from the literature to inform the cutoff choice used at the pruning step. Following Hampson et al. [69] , we assumed a Gamma distributed serial interval, with mean 23.6 days and standard deviation 20.9 days [69] . We assumed a Rayleigh distributed spatial Kernel with scale 0.70km, consistent with a mean transmission distance of 0.88 km, as in Hampson et al. [69] (see S1 Text). We assumed a substitution rate of 5.9 x 10 \u22124 substitutions per site per year for rabies, as estimated in Bourhy et al. [39] . The distributions of the serial interval, spatial kernel, and number of mutations between transmission pairs are shown in S1 Fig. We considered, as in Bourhy et al. [39] , a reporting rate of 20% in our main analyses (presented in the main text), and reporting rates of 10 and 50% respectively in two extreme scenarios considered in sensitivity analyses (shown in S1 Text). Finally, in our main analyses we used the 95% quantile of all input distributions as cutoff at the pruning step. Cutoffs corresponding to the 90% and the 98% quantiles were also considered in sensitivity analyses (S1 Text).",

            "text": "We performed a simulation study to assess the ability of our method to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission and to accurately estimate the underlying reproduction number and importation rate. We considered six simulation scenarios mimicking the transmission of rabies among dogs. Our baseline scenario was designed to closely mirror the transmission characteristics underlying the transmission of rabies in our dataset from Bangui. We then considered five variations of this scenario: a 'low', 'high' and 'perfect' reporting scenarios similar to the baseline scenario but with varying levels of reporting, and a 'low' and 'high' diversity scenarios, similar to our baseline but where the imported cases had pathogen genetic sequences respectively much more similar and much more different to one another. The scenarios are described in S1 Table. For each simulation scenario, we used our method to reconstruct the clusters of cases linked by transmission, as well as re-estimate the reproduction number and the importation rate. In the reconstruction process, we used input distributions obtained by assuming the same mutation rate, genome length, serial interval and spatial kernel as in the simulation. For the analysis of the baseline simulations, we systematically varied the cutoffs and reporting rate, as described in S2 Table. Detailed information on the simulation process is available in S1 Text. Following Beugin et al. [35] , we quantify the ability of our method to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission, through measuring 1) the true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity, i.e. the proportion of pairs of cases belonging to the same transmission tree who are inferred to be in the same outbreak cluster), 2) the true negative rate (TNR) or specificity, i.e. the proportion of pairs of cases not belonging to the same transmission tree who are assigned to different outbreak clusters and 3) the mean between TPR and TNR, which is proportional to the Rand index, a common criterion used to evaluate clustering methods [35, 70] . We also compare the estimates of the reproduction number and importation rate to the values used in the simulation. , spatial (middle) and genetic (right) distances for rabies. The temporal distance is defined as the time between sampling of the pathogen in cases. The spatial distance is defined as the Euclidean distance between the locations of cases. The genetic distance is defined as the number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between the Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) sampled from cases. The grey histograms show the observed pairwise distances between any two cases reported in the Bangui outbreak. The solid black lines show the assumed distribution of distances between a case and its closest observed ancestry, given an assumed reporting rate of 10% (top row), 20% (middle row) and 50% (bottom row); note that the distributions have been rescaled to fit on the same graph as the histograms. The vertical lines show the cutoffs corresponding to the 90% (yellow), 95% (orange) and 98% (red) quantiles of these distributions. For a given data stream and a given choice of reporting rate and cutoff, pairs of cases with observed distance above the cutoff are considered not connected, and the corresponding graph edges are removed at the pruning step (see Fig 1 in main text) .

In this example, two data streams are considered: the spatial locations of the cases (A) and a phylogeny of pathogens from these cases (D). The three 'actual' outbreak clusters are identified in red, blue and green, using different shadings to identify individual cases. Each data source defines a fully connected graph where nodes represent cases and edges are weighted by the spatial (B) and genetic distances (E). Thicker edges represent smaller weights (distances) between cases. Each graph is then pruned separately, removing edges whose weight exceeds a given cutoff (C, F). The intersection of these graphs defines a new graph which retains only edges present in every pruned graph (G). The resulting clusters of cases indicate likely outbreak clusters.",

The solid black lines show the input distribution of distances between a case and its closest observed ancestor, given an assumed reporting rate of 20% (see S1 Text for sensitivity analyses to this assumption). Distributions have been rescaled to fit on the same graph as the histograms. The red vertical lines show the cutoffs corresponding to the 95% quantiles of these distributions.
