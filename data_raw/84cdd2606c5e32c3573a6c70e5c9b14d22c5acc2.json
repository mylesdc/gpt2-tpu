We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197,207 cases of HFMD over the period 2003-2012 at the national level and of 57,502 cases in 10,080 institutional outbreaks over the period 2011-2016 in Singapore. The effects of school closure due to 1) institutional outbreaks, 2) public holidays, and 3) school vacations were assessed using a Bayesian time series modeling approach. School closure was associated with a reduction in HFMD transmission rate. During public holidays, average numbers of secondary cases having onset the week after dropped by 53% (95% credible interval 44-62%), and during school vacations, the number of secondary cases dropped by 7% (95% credible interval 3-10%). Schools being temporarily closed in response to an institutional outbreak reduced the average number of new cases by 1,204 (95% credible interval 1,140-1,297). Despite the positive effect in reducing transmission, the effect of school closure is relatively small and may not justify the routine use of this measure.",

In preschools, daily routine health checks for all children and isolation of suspected cases are implemented for early detection and control of outbreaks. 11 Should transmission continue within an outbreak, school closure is enforced. 12 This policy was implemented following an outbreak in 2000 in which several children died from enterovirus 71 complications 13, 14 ; the details have evolved over time, but until recently, if a school has more than 16 cases or an attack rate more than 23% with a transmission period more than 24 days, the school will be required to close for a period of 10 days. 15 In the most updated guideline, the policy has been relaxed somewhat, and Ministry of Health will consider the predominant circulating strain when assessing closure in addition to the trigger. This change provides an avenue to assess the impact of this policy.",

In Singapore, HFMD is endemic with year-round transmission and is legally notifiable by physicians and childcare teachers, as well as actively screened for in preschool-aged children. These policies provide data that enable us to obtain three sources of information on the effect of school closure: 1) the reduction in the numbers of cases after a public holiday, when childcare centers and schools close; 2) the reduction during school vacations; and 3) the impact within childcare centers of school closure in response to an ongoing outbreak. Singapore's school closure policy for HFMD, which has been implemented for over a decade, in tandem with a comprehensive HFMD surveillance system, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of this important method of outbreak control.",

Here, \u03bc represents the average number of cases on a typical day; estimates of \u03b8 and a 95% credible interval provide a measure of the public holiday effect (i.e., 1 \u00c0 \u03b8 is the reduction in the number of infections on a public holiday compared with that on a normal day); and \u03b1 i \u223c \u0393\u00f0a,a\u00de is an individual week effect which has an expected value of 1 and allows for autocorrelation in the time series. The window length of 1 week was selected to ensure balance in the number of weekdays in each window and to correspond roughly to the assumed incubation period of HFMD of around 3-7 days. 2 This model assumes that the difference between the number of cases prior or after the public holidays is purely because of the difference in the number of infections happening on the public holiday, which is unobservable but indirectly represented by the change in the number of symptomatic cases in the following weeks.",

A negative binomial distribution is used to allow more flexibility to capture the observed variability in the data than that obtained using the Poisson model originally considered. A constant b that does not vary with time was used because Singapore has very little seasonality that would add forcing to the timing of epidemics of HFMD, 28 and because it would hamper identifiability of the vacation effect. The adequacy of using a constant b was assessed and confirmed by examining the distribution of the residual of 1-week-ahead model forecasts. The model was fit using Bayesian methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo) with non-informative prior distributions, as described in the Supplemental File. For each draw from the posterior distribution, we iteratively derived the median number of cases for the following week based on the number of cases in the current week using the formula in the aforementioned model. The number of cases in the first week of the simulations was taken to be the observed average weekly number of cases across the time horizon. This was done for 104 weeks (2 years) and only the latter 52 weeks were kept as the number of weekly cases for a typical year. For each set of posterior values, 1,000 such simulations were performed. Based on these 1,000 simulations of a typical year scenario using each of the 10,000 sets of posterior values, 95% prediction and credible intervals were derived for each of the 52 time points. Median values for all 1,000 simulated numbers for each set of posterior values (10,000 median values in total) were calculated.",

In all, 9,903 outbreaks including 100 closures were included in our model: 177 schools without accurate enrolment sizes were removed and four schools with closure falling beyond 50 days after the first day of outbreak were categorized as no closure (detailed in Supplemental File 1) . The Bayesian Poisson model shows that the expected number of new cases decreases to 26% (95% CI: 21-32%) if a school was closed on that day compared with a normal school day, after adjusting for size and duration of the outbreak. One-dayahead predictions based on the previous day's observed number of cases, shown in Figure 2 for arbitrarily selected outbreaks (more outbreaks are presented in Supplemental File 2), both with and without short-term school closure, demonstrate that the fitted model adequately captures the observed outbreak patterns. Figure 3 show the effect of school closure by showing the cumulative number of cases if there were no school closure for four arbitrarily selected outbreaks with closure (more outbreaks are presented in Supplemental File 3). The percentage of cases avoided from school closure for all closures is shown in Figure 4 . The majority of school closure events (> 80%) were associated with a less than 5% difference between observed and modeled cases, regardless of outbreak size at closure. Closures that prevented more than 10% of total school size were generally in bigger schools (of size more than 200).

Its effectiveness has been assessed in modeling studies, 19, 20, 22 which posit that because children have closer social networks and high contact rates in schools, 31 closing schools may substantially reduce transmission, if they do not compensate by having greater contact outside of school during a closure. The burden of school closure on families which may need to make alternative childcare arrangements means that it is imperative to have real-world evidence supporting its effectiveness. Relatively little such evidence is available, though some studies in Japan, France and the United States have assessed school closures in response to influenza outbreaks. 18, 32 In light of this, the evidence on the effect of closure from Singapore's long-standing routine school closures to control HFMD may prove valuable.",

There was an estimated decrease of 7% in the number of cases in the week after a public holiday than the week before it, corresponding to a reduction in the number of infections that occurs on the holiday itself of 53%, although the effect of the holiday declines in the weeks following as infections return to baseline levels. A similar reduction in the number of infections during school vacations was also estimated (also about 7%). This may be an underestimate of the actual effect size because many preschool-aged children still attend preschools during school holidays. This hypothesis is supported by the slightly accentuated effect in children who have started formal schooling, with a reduction in risk around 10% for children aged 6 years and older. Although the reduction was statistically significant for all age groups, the difference in effect between age groups was not statistically significant.",

This led to a decrease in the number of school closures in the later periods of the study (Table 3) . Although not randomized, this change allowed some overlap in the exposure (closure) and response (outbreak growth). The analysis showed that as with holidays and public holidays, school closure during an outbreak had the intended effect of Orange line shows the cumulative number of cases if the school was not closed during the closure period.

This figure appears in color at www.ajtmh.org. mitigating transmission, but the effect was relatively small, and we estimated that only \u223c1,200 cases were averted over the 6 years analyzed. The high asymptomatic rate 33, 34 and seroprevalence of the main causative viruses 35 may mean that a substantial fraction of children are no longer susceptible by the time of closures in response to large outbreaks, which is currently triggered when more than 16 cases or 23% of children are symptomatic. The fraction of cases prevented by outbreak-induced closure was modeled to be small in general, but larger for the larger preschools, which we attribute to the structure of the thresholds for closure: this is effected when either the fraction or the number of children in the school is notified, meaning that closure of larger schools occurs when the threshold for the number of cases is hit but the fraction is still low. Given the disruptions to parents/families from unplanned closures, 11,36 outbreak-driven closures may, therefore, cause more problems than closure because of holidays. In light of the limited effect, it is not clear that this policy should be continued to be used routinely for HFMD outbreaks, but the effect of closures because of holidays suggests that a school closure policy may still be valuable for pandemic preparedness plans and needs to be carried out when there are serious outbreaks or when the outbreak is due to novel pathogens of unknown severity.",

However, some other limitations exist. Several assumptions were made in the modeling process: the public holiday effect analysis assumed that the observed difference in the number of cases before and after the public holiday was solely attributable to the public holiday. In temperate countries, this assumption may not be tenable because of seasonal changes that drive transmission. Singapore, however, lies close to the equator and has almost no seasonality-having year-round high temperature and humidity-with the effect that some virus transmission is effectively aseasonal. 28 For the same reason, the assumption that there are no other temporal effects in the school vacation analysis may be more robust than it would in a temperate setting.",
