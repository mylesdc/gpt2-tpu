            "text": "One year after the occurrence of the first case of infection by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) there is no clear consensus on the best treatment to propose. The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFNa, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFNa, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFNc that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. We highlight the critical role of IFNa in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFNa treatment during MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses, like most successful viruses, have evolved strategies to evade the innate immune response. Type-1 interferon (IFN) expression is a crucial component of this initial response, and coronaviruses have developed strategies to prevent IFN induction [4] . Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are recognized by the innate immune system through activation of cytosolic (RIG-1 and MDA-5) [5] and membranous (TLR3) [6, 7] pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The recognition by these PRRs triggers the activation of Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF3, IRF7) which leads to the induction of type-1 interferon, such as IFNa and IFNb [8] . Type-1 IFN activates immune anti-viral effectors such as Natural Killer (NK) cells [9] , T CD8+ cells and macrophages, allowing viral clearance [10] . Consistent with the studies demonstrating that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV proteins contribute to dampen type-1 IFN signalling to evade innate immunity and viral clearance [1, 7] , an in vitro study reported a beneficial effect of Interferon-alpha (IFNa) treatment on MERS-CoV replication in a cellular model [11] . In this study the authors showed that MERS-CoV was 50-100 times more sensitive to IFNa treatment than SARS-CoV. However, to date there is no clear therapeutic protocol beside supportive treatment in MERS-CoV infection.",

We assessed the secretion of IL-17A in BAL supernatants and showed that IL-17A secretion was increased in both patients in response to MERS-CoV ( Figure 4B) , with higher level for patient 1 compared to patient 2. We hypothesized the involvement of IL-23 secretion, known in humans to trigger IL-17 secretion in response to viruses [18, 19] . To this end, we assessed IL-23 secretion in the lungs and found that IL-23 secretion was significantly increased in BAL from patient 1 compared to patient 2 ( Figure 4B ). Finally, we found elevated IL-23 and IL-17A levels in the serum of patient 1, in the first days following the infection by MERS-CoV ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, IL-23 secretion was increased in the BAL supernatant of patient 2 during HSV replication. many questions that remain to be answered, options for treatment are a major concern for the medical community. Although it is very difficult to draw a simple line from a clinical observation to a therapeutic protocol, the analysis of the host response is a cornerstone in the design of relevant approaches. This report characterizes the immune response of two patients with different outcomes and highlights the critical role of IFNa in the innate immune response to orchestrate an early adaptive Th-1 response, mediated by IL-12 and IFNc, against MERS-CoV infection.",

The decrease in IRF3 and 7 was associated with a major decrease in IFNa expression and secretion in BAL as well as in serum. Josset et al. demonstrated in an in vitro microarray analysis that MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV [7] , suppressed antigen presentation pathways by down-regulating type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes [17] . To assess the consequences of this down-regulation, we quantified the production of two key cytokines, IL-12 and IFNc, involved in the activation of lymphocytes into T CD4+ Th-1 cells. Our results show a clear difference between the two patients with a significant increase of both IL-12 and IFNc in patient 2. The analysis of viral clearance shows that patient 2 rapidly cleared the infection with negative blood samples at the end of the first week, while MERS-CoV was detected in serum from patient 1 until death.",

            "text": "Previous studies focusing on the outcome of SARS-CoV infected patients showed that an early and robust innate immune response mediated by type-1 IFN led to high level of IFNstimulated cytokines and was required for the development of an effective adaptive immune response [14] . Further supporting our observation, patient 1 exhibited persistent viral replication with high levels of CXCL10, a type-1 IFN triggered chemokine [14] . Conversely, patients who survived could promote type-1 IFN response, control viral replication, and down-regulate this response, exhibiting low levels of CXCL10 when recovering from infection. IL-10, a cytokine associated with Th-2 adaptive immune response that represses IFNc secretion [20] , was associated with poor outcome in the early stage of SARS-CoV infection [7] . Here we observed that patient 1 showed a persistent IL-10 secretion instead of antiviral Th-1 immune response that may have contributed to poor outcome. Finally, Josset et al. previously showed that MERS-CoV could promote IL-17 expression in vitro [17] . We confirmed this observation in the lungs and sera of patient 1, and to a lesser extent in patient 2. Recently, a study reported the critical role of IRF3 in CD8+ T lymphocytes to promote IL-17 secretion. Indeed, IRF3 directly interacts with RORct (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma) and avoids the activation of the IL-17 promoter and the Th-17 differentiation of the T CD8+ lymphocytes [21] . Here we show that patient 1 did not express IRF3 in response to MERS-CoV and secreted low levels of IFNa but high levels of IL-17, in the lungs and serum. Conversely, patient 2 expressed high levels of IRF3 ( Figure 1C ) that triggered IFNa secretion in the lungs, but IL-17 secretion was decreased. IRF3 in humans exhibits high polymorphism [22] that may explain the difference between immune responses and outcomes of patients 1 and 2. Further investigations may be required and the sequencing of this key protein in our two patients may contribute to better understand host susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Based on the analysis of the clinical course of two patients with completely different outcome, we emphasize the major role of the host immune response in MERS-CoV infection. Our results suggest a key role of the interferon pathway. From this hypothesis, a treatment with alpha interferon represents an attractive pathophysiologic approach in this disease. Several authors suggest that coronaviruses could evade the host response and blunt the interferon pathway. Patients able to trigger IFN production could optimize viral clearance and develop a controlled immune response, while the absence of pathogen recognition could lead to viral replication and uncontrolled immune response ( Figure 5 ). Administration of interferon could therefore enhance the host response. This molecule has been suggested in the recent review published by Momattin et al. [23] . . This activation triggers IRF 3 which leads to the production of IFNa. IFN activates anti viral effectors like T CD8+ cells allowing viral clearance. Right panel: In the absence of recognition, the decrease in IRF 3 is associated to a decreased production of IL 12 and IFNc. IL 10 production further represses IFNc secretion leading to a decreased CD8 T lymphocytes proliferation and an increased viral replication. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0088716.g005",

The resulting cDNA (equivalent to 25 ng of total RNA) was amplified using the KAPASYBR real-time PCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, United States of America) and detected on an ABI7900HT (Applied Biosystem, UK).
