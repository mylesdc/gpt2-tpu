Six types of HCoVs have been discovered, the most recent one termed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The aim of this study is to monitor the circulation of HCoV types in the population during 2015-2016 in Israel. HCoVs were detected by real-time PCR analysis in 1910 respiratory samples, collected from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients during the winter sentinel influenza survey across Israel. Moreover, 195 HCoV-positive samples from hospitalized patients were detected during one year at Soroka University Medical Center. While no MERS-CoV infections were detected, 10.36% of patients in the survey were infected with HCoV-OC43 (43.43%), HCoV-NL63 (44.95%), and HCoV-229E (11.62%) viruses. The HCoVs were shown to co-circulate with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to appear prior to influenza virus infections. HCoV clinical symptoms were more severe than those of RSV infections but milder than influenza symptoms. Hospitalized patients had similar HCoV types percentages. However, while it was absent from the public winter survey, 22.6% of the patients were HCoV-HKU1 positives, mainly during the spring-summer period.",

            "text": "HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were first identified in 1967 as the cause of upper and mild respiratory tract infections [7, 8] . During 2002 and 2003, SARS-CoV caused a worldwide epidemic, concluding in 8273 confirmed infections with a fatality rate of 9%; beside a few zoonotic cases and laboratory-acquired infections in December 2003 and in 2004, there have been no SARS-CoV transmitting within the human population after July 2003 [9, 10] . SARS-CoV infection results in sudden onset of flu-like syndrome which includes fever, dry cough, and non-respiratory symptoms e.g., diarrhea, myalgia, headache and chills/rigors [11] . In 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. Its distinctive genomic features were important in identifying seven additional HCoV-NL63-infected individuals suffering from respiratory illness [12] . In 2005, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from patients with pneumonia and was defined as a new group of HCoV, featuring the lowest G + C content (32%) among all coronaviruses with a known genome sequence [13] . MERS-CoV was first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi-Arabia in September 2012 [14, 15] . Dromedary camels are considered a possible source of MERS-CoV infection, since MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were found in camels from the Spanish Canary Islands, Oman, and Egypt [16] . Until April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 261 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases, resulting in 93 deaths. Of these, 145 were reported in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates [17, 18] . Recently a major MERS-CoV outbreak was reported in the Republic of Korea, with 186 infected individuals, resulting in 38 deaths [19] . At the end of May 2018, a total of 2220 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 790 associated deaths were reported globally; 1844 cases of these were reported from Saudi Arabia [20] .",

SARS and MERS are respiratory infections which are exceptionally severe and sometimes may lead to death. No SARS-CoV infections have been reported since 2004, however, several outbreaks of MERS-CoV were noted in the recent years [27] .",

            "text": "Here, we analyzed 1910 samples of ILI patients, collected in 26 sentinel clinics in Israel during winter season 2015-2016. Moreover, we examined 195 HCoV-positive samples from Soroka Medical Center, Beersheba, during one year. Approximately 50% of the samples in the public proved influenzaor RSV-positive. In addition, 198 HCoV-positive samples (10.36%) were identified, the majority carrying HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-NL63. Similarly, a study conducted in the Netherlands on healthy and hospitalized infants reported on dominancy of HCoV-OC43 and -NL63 infections [28] . Infections with HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E were less frequent. The Dijkman R et al. hypothesis was that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infections respectively [28] . Yet, morbidity associated with the various HCoV strains is inconsistent and subject to change from year to year [29] . In 2002-2003, a study in Bangkok, Thailand, found HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses in 4.9% of acute respiratory tract illness samples of young children, with the majority being HCoV-229E infections [30] . In contrast, a study in rural Thailand found HCoV-OC43 to be dominant over HCoV-229E, suggesting that morbidity of the various types of HCoV infections also depends on regional environment [29] . Analysis of the prevalence of coronaviruses in children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong during 2001-2002, showed that HCoV-NL63 was dominant (57.69% of HCoV-positive samples), followed by HCoV-OC43 (34.61%) and HCoV-229E (7.69%) [31] . A retrospective study in Australia tested for four HCoV types in the winter season of 2004. A total of 74 coronavirus infections (8.3%) were detected, with HCoV-HKU1 being the most dominant (46.6% of all HCoV), followed by HCoV-OC43 (37.0%), HCoV-NL63 (12.3%) and HCoV-229E (5.5%) [32] . These findings, together with similar analyses by other groups [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] demonstrate that morbidity associated with the various HCoV types is difficult to predict since they do not infect every year, their infection rate varies and depends on geographical environment. In general, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 have been reported to have winter seasonality, however, in Hong Kong HCoV-NL63 had a spring-summer peak of activity [12, 31, 36] . In our study, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 co-circulated with RSV throughout the entire winter season, starting before and persisting until the end of the influenza season. On the other hand, HCoV-HKU1 circulates in the spring-summer season. Generally, HCoVs co-circulate and display marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and are not detected in summer months [37] . To our knowledge, this is the first time HCoV-HKU1 is reported to circulate in summer season. Environmental conditions may contribute to understand this finding. During December 2015 until February 2016 and April 2016 until June 2016, the average temperature and humidity in Israel were 19 \u2022 C, 57% and 25 \u2022 C, 66% respectively (An average data from Tel-Aviv station #2410 at 2 pm, collected from Israel Meteorological Service database, https://ims.data.gov.il/ims).",

This determination is consistent with our findings; however, we noted that more than 50% of the HCoV-positive patients were children. A major seroconversion for HCoVs occurs in infants up to the age of 20 months and immunity against one HCoV may influence future infection by other HCoV type [28] . Israeli HCoVs were associated with significantly lower or similar symptoms frequencies as compared to influenza. Yet, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 patients had higher symptom frequencies for fatigue, headache, muscle pain, trembling and sore throat as compared to RSV patients. This observation may be of importance when considering hospitalization of infants and young children, that are more susceptible to RSV infection [26] , especially when HCoVs and RSV co-circulate.",
