Inactivation of YopH activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity. We have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) against YopH phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ATA reversibly decreases the activity of YopH. Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from -2.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide. Here we showed that ATA indicates a unique mechanism of YopH inactivation due to a redox process. We proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are a result of its strong binding in the YopH active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue.",

It is considered to be a potential anti-AIDS compound by preventing binding of HIV coat protein, gp120, to its CD4 receptor [17] . It has been demonstrated that ATA can inhibit the replication of viruses from several different families, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, also coronavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus. It does so by the inhibition of phosphatase activity of viral enzyme [18] .

Protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is abundantly expressed in all non-nucleated haematopoietic cells and is critical for T-cell and B-cell functions. It dephosphorylates the Src kinases, therefore is important to immune-receptor modulated signaling. The inactivation of CD45 would lead to serious complications for the host immunity [21] . We found that ATA is more effective against YopH phosphatase than CD45.",

The inactivation of the inhibitory activity of the compound in the presence of catalase is likely through an oxidative mechanism, due to the fact that catalase is an enzyme protecting cells from reactive oxygen species by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [22] . Some of the PTP inhibitors are acting by production of hydrogen peroxide, which is suggested as a key regulator of PTP activity in cells [23] . ATA loses the inhibitory properties against PTPs in the presence of catalase, which shows that the mechanism of ATA induced inactivation of YopH is probably involved with the oxidation of catalytic cysteine in an active site. It is confirmed also by the loss of unoxidized thiol groups in YopH after treatment with ATA.",

The cyclic voltammetry for generation and detection of superoxide anions by the electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen is very useful and easy to follow the reaction of superoxide anions with bioactive compounds at the electrode surface [25] . The obtained results indicate that ATA directly reacts with oxygen and reactive oxygen forms in DMSO solution.

By performing molecular dynamics simulations of the complex we found that two carboxyl groups of ATA bind directly toward the essential amino-acid residues for enzyme catalysis in the active site. Cys403 and Arg409 are involved in the reaction of dephosphorylation of substrate on tyrosine residues. The binding conformation of ATA in the YopH active site contributed to the relatively strong calculated binding affinity of ATA in comparison to natural substrate.",

The studies on inhibitory properties of ATA against YopH are a good starting point for the synthesis of analogous inhibitors and potentially lead to clinical applications.

The concentration of oxygen in oxygen-saturated DMSO at 298 K was 2.2 \u00b7 10 -3 M [27] . During all the experiments with oxygen the air was carefully excluded from the measurement cell and the oxygen was bubbled directly into the cell in order to obtain desirable concentration.
