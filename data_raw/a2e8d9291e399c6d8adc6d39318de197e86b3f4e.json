GL is also known to exhibit various biological activities, including antiviral effects, but the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) effect of GL remains to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that GL treatment of HCV-infected Huh7 cells caused a reduction of infectious HCV production using cell cultureproduced HCV (HCVcc). To determine the target step in the HCV lifecycle of GL, we used HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), replicon, and HCVcc systems. Significant suppressions of viral entry and replication steps were not observed. Interestingly, extracellular infectivity was decreased, and intracellular infectivity was increased. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analysis of GL treated cells, HCV core antigens and electron-dense particles had accumulated on endoplasmic reticulum attached to lipid droplet (LD), respectively, which is thought to act as platforms for HCV assembly. Furthermore, the amount of HCV core antigen in LD fraction increased. Taken together, these results suggest that GL inhibits release of infectious HCV particles. GL is known to have an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We found that group 1B PLA2 (PLA2G1B) inhibitor also decreased HCV release, suggesting that suppression of virus release by GL treatment may be due to its inhibitory effect on PLA2G1B. Finally, we demonstrated that combination treatment with GL augmented IFN-induced reduction of virus in the HCVcc system. GL is identified as a novel anti-HCV agent that targets infectious virus particle release.",

Current treatment of chronic hepatitis C is based on the combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin. However, approximately 50% of treated patients infected with genotype 1 do not respond, or show only a partial or transient response, and therapy causes significant side effects [1] . In Japan, glycyrrhizin (GL) preparations (stronger neo-minophagen C (SNMC)) have been used for more than 20 years as a treatment for chronic hepatitis patients who do not respond to IFN therapy.",

In the cytoplasm of HCV-infected cells, we observed increased numbers of LDs in close proximity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the electron-dense signals on ER attached to LD ( Figure 2G upper panel) , which are thought to act as platforms for the assembly of viral components [29] . Interestingly, in the cytoplasm of HCV-infected cells after treatment with GL, accumulated electron-dense particles were observed on ER attached to LD ( Figure 2G lower panel) . IEM experiments showed that anti-core antibody stained the membrane around LDs ( Figure 2I lower panel) . In na\u00efve Huh7 cells, the close association of LDs with ER was rarely observed ( Figure 2H ). HCVcc-infected cells were treated with GL at 500 \u00b5M for 72 hours. Untreated cells were used as controls. Supernatant was ultracentrifuged through a 10-60% sucrose gradient and the infectivity of each fraction was determined. Infectivity of fraction 2 of untreated cells was assigned the arbitrary value of 100%. The density of each fraction was measured by refractive index measurement. Brefeldin A (1 \u00b5M for 24 hours) was used as a positive control for reduced HCV release. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of the percent of the control from four independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005 versus control (0 \u00b5M treatment). Scale bars, 200 and 500 nm. To confirm the accumulation of core antigen around LD, we purified the LD [23] , and quantified HCV core antigen and TG in the LD fraction, followed by immunoblotting with anti-actin antibody ( Figure 2J ). Analysis of the levels of HCV core antigen and TG in the LD fraction of the total cell lysate showed that the amount in GL-treated cells was increased by 31% and 35% compared with controls, respectively ( Figure 2K and 2L) . Taken together, these results suggested that GL inhibits release, but not assembly and budding, of infectious HCV particles in cells.",

To analyze the antiviral effect of IFN combined with GL, HCVcc-infected cells were treated with 0.1 and 1.0 IU/ml of IFN in combination with various concentrations of GL. HCV core level in culture medium ( Figure 4A ) and in the cell ( Figure 4B ), specific infectivity in culture medium ( Figure 4C ) and in the cells ( Figure  4D) were measured. Regardless to the IFN concentration, HCV core level and specific infectivity of the supernatant decreased in response to GL treatment in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 4A and 4C) . On the other hand, HCV core level and specific infectivity of the cell increased ( Figure 4B and 4D) , suggesting that GL inhibited HCV release. The results indicated that a combination therapy of IFN with GL could be an effective treatment for HCV.",

Their cell culture system does not produce HCV efficiently. Thus, it does not permit analysis of the complete viral life cycle. In this study, we observed distinct suppression of HCV release by GL, using the HCVcc system ( Figure 1A ). Anti-viral effects of GL on early steps in the viral lifecycle have been reported previously, for example the inhibition of endocytosis of influenza A virus (IAV), the direct fusion of HIV-1 [35] , the penetration of the plasma membrane of HAV [11] and EBV [15] , the virus entry of SARS [14] , and infection by pseudorabies virus [36] . GL effectively inhibits the replication of VZV [10] , HSV-1 [9] , EBV [15] and HIV [13] . This is the first report that GL can suppress virus release, however, the detailed mechanisms of these remain elusive. It has also been reported that GL had a membrane stabilizing effect [37] and a reduction of membrane fluidity [35] , [38] . HCV uses cellular membrane structure in its lifecycle [39] , [40] . Thus, it is conceivable that membrane alterations may play a negative role in the HCV lifecycle.",

The overexpression of PLA2G1B did not have any effect on HCV release (data not shown), probably because enough PLA2G1B existed in the cells. This result is generally observed in other host factors that involved in HCV lifecycle. For example, overexpression of the human homologue of the 33-kDa vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-33), which has a critical role in the formation of HCV replication complex, did not increase HCV replication [42] . PLA2 family proteins have been known as lipid-signaling molecules, inducing inflammation [43] . On the basis of the nucleotide sequence, the superfamily of PLA2 enzymes consists of 15 groups, comprising 4 main types: cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), calcium-independent PLA2, platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase/oxidized lipid lipoprotein associated PLA2, and the secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) including PLA2G1B, 2A, and 4A [44] . In this study, we showed that GL, PLA2G1B inhibitor, and PLA2G1B siRNA inhibited HCV release and that GL and OPC had no additive effect when applied together, suggesting that suppression of HCV release by GL may be derived from its inhibitory effect on PLA2G1B. The role of PLA2G1B in the HCV lifecycle has not been reported. In this study, we also demonstrated that PLA2G2A inhibitor decreased entry, replication, and assembly of infectious HCV particles in cells ( Figures 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D ). The role of PLA2G2A in the HCV lifecycle has not been reported. PLA2G2A is known to affect the secretion of VLDL (30) . Therefore, PLA2G2A may contribute to HCV assembly. In the case of PLA2G4A, Menzel et al. showed that inhibition of PLA2G4A produces aberrant HCV particles [45] . These observations suggest that PLA2 has a role in several steps of the HCV lifecycle.",

It has been reported that the maximum peripheral concentration of GL in normal patients is 145 \u00b5M [46] . The placebo-controlled phase I/II trial revealed no significant effect on viral titer [47] . In vivo, accumulated HCV in GL treated cells may cause lysis and apoptosis of the cells, leading to the release of infectious particles in the circulation. This may be a major limitation to use GL mono-therapy against HCV infection in patients. On the other hand, combination treatment with GL augmented the IFNinduced reduction in HCV core antigen levels ( Figure 4A) .",

            "text": "Although a number of natural compounds with anti-HCV activities were identified in recent years (Silymarin, EGCG, Ladanein, Naringenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, Honokiol, 3-hydroxy caruilignan C, and other things) [48] , many aspects concerning their mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, GL is identified as a novel anti-HCV agent that targets the release steps of infectious HCV particles. We found that the suppression of viral release by GL may be due to an inhibitory effect of PLA2G1B. These observations provide a basis for development of an improved IFN-based combination therapy against chronic hepatitis C. Figure S1 . Anti-HCV effect of GL. HCVcc-infected cells were treated with various concentrations of GL for 72 hours. HCV production was assessed by measuring the level of HCV core antigen in culture medium. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of the percent of the control from four independent experiments. IFN (10 IU/ml) was used as a positive control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005 versus control (0 \u00b5M treatment). (TIF) Figure S2 . Effect of GL on expression of PLA2G1B. A human PLA2G1B cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS, yielding pCAGPLA2G1B. Since there was no effective antibody to detect endogenous expression of PLA2G1B, 293T cells transfected with the pCAGPLA2G1B plasmid were treated with GL (500 \u00b5M) for 72 hours and lysed in lysis buffer, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PLA2G1B and anti-actin antibodies. OPC (10 \u00b5M) was used as a positive control to reduce PLA2G1B protein in the cells. (TIF) Figure S3 . Effect of PLA2G1B siRNA on expression of PLA2G1B. HCVcc infected-Huh7 cells in a 24-well plate were transfected with siRNAs targeted to PLA2G1B and scramble negative control siRNA, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PLA2G1B and anti-actin antibodies. (TIF) Figure S4 . Effect of GL on IFN induction. The pISRE-Luc vector contains the firefly luciferase reporter gene, downstream of the IFN-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) cis-acting enhancer element. The pRL-TK vector contains the renilla luciferase reporter downstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK promoter), and was used as an internal control. Huh7 cells transfected with the pISRE-Luc vector and the pRL-TK vector were treated with various concentrations of GL for 72 hours, and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. IFN (300 U/ml) was used as a positive control. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD percent of the controls (treatment with IFN). (TIF) Figure S5 . Effect of GL on secretion of lipoprotein and the host proteins. Huh7 cells were treated or untreated with GL at 500 \u00b5M for 72 hours. ApoE and albumin in the culture supernatants were measured by immunoblotting and ELISA, respectively. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of the percent of the control from four independent experiments. (TIF)",

(B) Cell viability was assessed using Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Huh7 cells were infected with HCVpp2a (C), HCVpp1b (D), and VSVpp (E) in various concentrations of GL for 24 hours, and then medium was replaced. Effects of GL on entry of HCVpp and VSVpp were determined by measuring the luciferase activity at 72 hours post-transfection. (F) Huh7 cells harboring the type-2a subgenomic replicon were treated with various concentrations of GL for 72 hours. Replication efficiency of the replicon was estimated by measuring the luciferase activity. (G) The effects of GL on HCV replication were tested by electroporation of HCV RNA lacking E1E2 (JFH1delE1E2). (H) HCV particles were treated with increasing concentrations (0 to 1500\u00b5M) of GL. The viral samples were then used to inoculate Huh7 cells with GL-containing medium. Several hours post-infection, medium was replaced with DMEM without GL. The levels of HCV core antigen of the medium were determined at 72 h postinfection (p.i.). IFN (300 IU/ml) was used as a positive control for reduced HCV replication.

LDs and nuclei were stained with BODYPI 493/503 (green) and DAPI (blue), respectively. (C) Points a and b, as well as c and d, define two line segments that each cross several structures. Intensity profiles along the line segments shown on the bottom of the images. (F) The size of LDs in un-ifected cells (right panel) and HCV-infected cells (left panel) were quantified. Transmission EM of LDs in infected cells (G) and un-infected cells (H) treated with GL at 500 \u00b5M. Arrows indicate electron-dense signals (G upper panel) and particles (G lower panel). (I) IEM using the LAB method of LDs in infected cells treated with GL at 500 \u00b5M. Mouse IgG (upper panel) or anti-core monoclonal antibody (lower panel) was used for primary antibody. (J) Immunoblotting with anti-actin antibody in the LD fraction. Quantification of HCV core antigen (K) and TG (L) in the LD fraction. The LD fraction was collected from cell lysates. The ratio of HCV core antigen level in the LD fraction to that in total cell lysate was determined. (M)",

Effects of PLA2 inhibitor on the entry of HCVpp were determined by measuring the luciferase activity at 72 hours post-infection. Anti-human CD81 antibody (10 \u00b5g/ml) was used as a positive control for reducing HCV entry to the cells. (B) Huh7 cells harboring the type-2a subgenomic replicon were treated with OPC or sPLA2IIA inhibitor for 72 hours. Replication efficiency of the replicon was estimated by measuring HCV RNA titer. HCVcc-infected cells were treated with PLA2 inhibitor for 72 hours. Specific infectivity of the supernatant (C) and cell lysate (D) were evaluated by quantifying the HCV core antigen in cells at 72 hours post-infection. (E) Effects of siRNA against PLA2G1B on core level in the medium (left panel) and specific infectivity in HCV-infected cells (right panel). ApoE siRNA was used as a positive control for reduced HCV infectivity. (F) HCVcc-infected cells were treated with GL (500 \u00b5M) with or without OPC (10 \u00b5M), and intracellular specific infectivity was measured. IFN (10 IU/ml) was used as a positive control. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of the percent of the control from four independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005 versus control (0 \u00b5M treatment).",
