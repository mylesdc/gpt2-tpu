            "text": "Intracellular nucleic acid sensors often undergo sophisticated modifications that are critical for the regulation of antimicrobial responses. Upon recognition of DNA, the cytosolic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the second messenger cGAMP, which subsequently initiates downstream signaling to induce interferon-\u03b1\u03b2 (IFN\u03b1\u03b2) production. Here we report that TRIM56 E3 ligase-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS is important for cytosolic DNA sensing and IFN\u03b1\u03b2 production to induce anti-DNA viral immunity. TRIM56 induces the Lys335 monoubiquitination of cGAS, resulting in a marked increase of its dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production. Consequently, TRIM56-deficient cells are defective in cGAS-mediated IFN\u03b1\u03b2 production upon herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. Furthermore, TRIM56-deficient mice show impaired IFN\u03b1\u03b2 production and high susceptibility to lethal HSV-1 infection but not to influenza A virus infection. This adds TRIM56 as a crucial component of the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway that induces anti-DNA viral innate immunity.",

Microbe-derived nucleic acids are potent PAMPs that elicit PRRmediated host immune responses 3 . The recognition of invading RNA viruses by cytoplasmic sensors (RIG-I and MDA5) and endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been extensively characterized 3 . The appearance of naked DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells also triggers DNA sensor-mediated signal transduction 4 . Many cytosolic DNA sensors have been identified, including AIM2 5-7 , DAI 8 , DDX41 9 , DNA-PK 10 , IFI16 11 , a form of RNA polymerase III 12, 13 , and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) 14, 15 . Particularly, recent studies have shown that cGAS functions as the primary cytosolic DNA sensor that triggers production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6, upon DNA transfection and DNA virus infection 14, 15 . Following activation, cGAS converts ATP and GTP into the dinucleotide cGAMP [16] [17] [18] . cGAMP is a second messenger that binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which in turn induces the recruitment of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) 18, 19 . Then, the TBK-mediated activation of the IRF-3 pathway induces the expression of type I IFNs. Thus cGAS-mediated DNA sensing signals through various adaptor molecules to ultimately induce potent antiviral innate immunity.",

            "text": "Since both self and non-self DNA can activate intracellular DNA sensors, this DNA sensing pathway must be tightly regulated to prevent harmful activity arising from unrestrained signaling 20 . Given the central role of the cGAS pathway in the innate immune response to viral infections, it is expected that various modulations and modifications to cGAS control its activity. We have previously reported that the autophagy protein Beclin-1 negatively regulates cGAS activity 21 . Beclin-1 directly interacts with cGAS and suppresses cGAMP synthesis and signaling. On the other hand, this interaction enhances the autophagy-mediated degradation of cytosolic pathogen DNA to avoid persistent immune stimulation. Several posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and glutamylation, have been reported to play critical roles in regulating the cGAS-STING pathway 22 . Glutamylation of cGAS impairs its DNA binding and enzymatic activity 23 . We have also shown that Akt kinase suppresses cGAS enzymatic activity by phosphorylating its carboxyl-terminal enzymatic domain. This suppresses the subsequent antiviral cytokine production and leads to increased DNA virus replication 24 . These modulations fine-tune the IFN-mediated antiviral pathway to ultimately ensure that the host-DNA-sensing innate immune response is kept in balance after responding to stimuli, such as DNA virus infections.",

            "text": "Protein ubiquitination controls a large number of cellular processes, including protein degradation, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, cell-cycle regulation, endocytosis, kinase signal pathways, and others 25 . The interaction between endoplasmic reticulum ubiquitin ligase RNF185 and cGAS specifically catalyzes the K27-linked polyubiquitination of cGAS, which promotes its enzymatic activity 26 . Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) E3 ubiquitin ligase family have arisen as key molecules in antiviral immunity, either as direct restriction factors of viral replication or as regulators of nucleic acid sensing pathways 27 . TRIM25 and TRIM4 mediate the K63-linked ubiquitination that activates RIG-I cytosolic RNA sensor 28 . On the other hand, TRIM14 inhibits the degradation of cGAS DNA sensor mediated by selective autophagy receptor p62, which promotes innate immune responses. TRIM56 has been shown to be a restriction factor of several RNA viruses (influenza virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus) both in an E3 ligase-dependent and -independent manner [29] [30] [31] . Furthermore, Salmonella typhimurium SopA HECT-type E3 ligase targets TRIM56 and TRIM65 to stimulate RIG-I and MDA5 innate immune receptors, which subsequently modulates inflammatory responses 32 . However, since previous studies were limited to in vitro cell culture assays, the in vivo role of TRIM56 still remains unclear. While an initial report described a direct role of TRIM56 in the STING-mediated double-stranded DNA sensing pathway, a later study convincingly disputed that TRIM56 has no role in the STING-mediated pathway, suggesting that alternative mechanisms or functions of TRIM56 should be explored 33, 34 .",

Mass spectrometry of a purified FLAG-tagged cGAS complex identified the IFN-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM56 with an apparent molecular mass of 81 kDa as a cGAS-binding partner (Fig. 1a) . Coimmunoprecipitation showed the specific interaction of cGAS-FLAG with either exogenous or endogenous TRIM56 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1b, c) . This interaction was specific since cGAS-FLAG did not interact with TRIM25 under the same conditions (Fig. 1b) . The single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) technique combines the principles of a conventional pull-down assay with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enables direct visualization of individual protein-protein interactions 35 . Specifically, this approach immobilizes protein complexes from lysed cells directly on a coverslip, which is then studied under a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. This SiMPull assay also revealed that TRIM56 effectively bound to cGAS (Fig. 1d) 21, 29 . We further examined whether TRIM56 directly interacted with cGAS by using bacterially purified cGAS and TRIM56 purified from HEK293T cells. Full-length (FL) cGAS fused with maltosebinding protein (MBP) interacted with TRIM56. However, both MBP-cGAS C-terminal region (a.a. 161-522) and MBP alone failed to interact with TRIM56 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Mapping study showed that the N-terminal RD of cGAS and the Cterminal NCL1-HT2A-Lin41 (NHL) homologous region of TRIM56 were responsible for their interaction (Fig. 1e) .

These results suggest that, unlike the previous report 33 , TRIM56 plays an important function in the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway upstream of STING. In order to further investigate the role of TRIM56 in cGASmediated DNA sensing, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to disrupt the TRIM56 gene in L929 mouse fibroblasts cGAS(\u2212) cells 36 and complemented with mouse cGAS-FLAG (Fig. 2c) . To comprehensively understand the role of TRIM56 on the cGAS-STING pathway upon DNA or RNA virus infection, we observed the co-localization of exogenously expressed cGAS or STING with endogenous TRIM56. Both endogenous TRIM56 and exogenous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-cGAS effectively co-localized at the indicated foci upon HT-DNA stimulation or HSV-1 infection but not upon SeV infection. However, STING did not co-localize with either cGAS or TRIM56 under any conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Collectively, the results indicate that TRIM56 is essential for cGAS-mediated DNA sensing activity.",

It was intriguing to detect that, upon treatment of proteasome inhibitor MG132 and deubiquitinase inhibitor n-ethylmaleimide, a small portion of cGAS underwent a migration shift with an apparent molecular weight of~8 kDa in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3a) . This migration shift was more obvious upon TRIM56 overexpression, suggesting that TRIM56 E3 ubiquitin ligase may induce the monoubiquitination of cGAS (Fig. 3a) . To examine the level of cGAS monoubiquitination with or without TRIM56 expression, the densities of the higher molecular-weight cGAS bands were quantitated in three independent experiments. This showed that cGAS monoubiquitination was increased~6 fold upon TRIM56 expression ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) . To test the potential TRIM56-mediated monoubiquitination of cGAS, HEK293T cells were transfected with cGAS-FLAG with or without TRIM56-V5, treated with MG132 and n-ethylmaleimide, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with a monoubiquitin-specific VU-1 antibody. A portion of cGAS was readily detected by VU-1 antibody and this VU-1 antibody reactivity was further increased by TRIM56 expression (Fig. 3b) . These monoubiquitinated forms of cGAS migrated near 75 kDa ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). To further confirm cGAS monoubiquitination, we used the previously described L929 cell lines. cGAS-FLAG was stably expressed in TRIM56(+) cGAS(\u2212) or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) L929 cells, and purified cGAS-FLAG protein was then subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-VU-1 antibody. This experiment showed that monoubiquitination of cGAS-FLAG could be only detected in TRIM56-expressing cells ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Finally, an in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified cGAS demonstrated that TRIM56 E3 ligase effectively induced the monoubiquitination of cGAS favorably with UbcH5a or UbcH5c as an E2 enzyme ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Taken together, these results collectively show that TRIM56 E3 ligase induces the monoubiquitination of cGAS.",

Three potential ubiquitination sites were identified: Lys278, Lys335, and Lys350 ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). To test their role in cGAS monoubiquitination, each of these lysine residues was mutated to arginine (Lys278R, Lys335R, and Lys350R). These mutants were co-expressed with TRIM56 and blotted with anti-VU-1 antibody.

Localization of the K335 residue on the interaction surface suggested that the TRIM56-induced monoubiquitination might facilitate cGAS dimerization and/or DNAbinding activity. To investigate whether TRIM56 affected the cGAS dimerization or oligomerization, we performed SiMPull photo bleaching analysis. Besides the protein-protein interaction shown in Fig. 1d , the SiMPull technique also provides a measure of protein stoichiometry directly determined from the stepwise pattern of fluorophore photo bleaching, as well as protein interactions with other compounds, such as nucleic acids, small molecule ligands, and lipids 42 . For the fluorophore photo bleaching assay, cGAS-GFP fusion was expressed in HEK293T cells with or without TRIM56, followed by photo bleaching and counting the fluorescence spots. This showed that a majority of WT cGAS and K335R mutant was present as a monomer without TRIM56 expression ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Approximately 20% of cGAS WT underwent dimerization upon TRIM56 expression, whereas the cGAS K335R mutant showed little or no increase in dimerization under these conditions (Fig. 4e) . cGAS dimerization increases DNA-binding activity and cGAS bound to DNA undergoes a conformational change to catalyze cGAMP synthesis 40, 41 . Thus we tested whether TRIM56 increases cGAS DNA-binding activity. Rhodaminelabeled DNA was co-transfected into vector-, cGAS-, or TRIM56/ cGAS-expressing cells. Further SiMPull analysis indicated that overexpression of TRIM56 efficiently increased the doublestranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding activity of cGAS WT but not the cGAS K335R mutant (Fig. 4f) . These results suggest that TRIM56 expression induces cGAS oligomerization, which subsequently increases its cGAS DNA-binding activity.",

To further assess the critical role of TRIM56 in the cGAS-mediated DNA sensing pathway, WT or TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 mouse bone marrowderived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 (Fig. 6a) . While WT BMDMs robustly induced IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression upon HSV-1 or HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 (Fig. 6a) . Timecourse experiments also showed that TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs induced little or no IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production upon HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 infection, whereas WT BMDMs robustly induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Fig. 6b, c) . Consistently, significant higher titers of HSV-1 were measured in TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs compared to WT BMDMs (Fig. 6d) . To determine whether the TRIM56 E3 ligase enzymatic activity is required to induce IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression upon HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 infection, we generated the enzymatically dead mutant (Mut) of TRIM56 by replacing the cysteine 21 and 24 residues with serines and complemented TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs with lentivirus-derived TRIM56WT or TRIM56 Mut (Supplementary Fig. 8b, Fig. 6e) . These results showed that, while expression of TRIM56WT in TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs efficiently induced IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression, expression of TRIM56 Mut led to a minimal increase of IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression (Fig. 6e) . We tested IFN responses in WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Similarly, we observed that TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs failed to induce IFN\u03b2 production following HT-DNA or pdA:dT stimulation compared to WT MEFs (Fig. 6f ). In addition, time-course experiments showed that TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDCs weakly induced IFN\u03b2 production compared to WT BMDCs upon HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 infection (Fig. 6g ). In agreement with previous in vivo infection results (Fig. 5f ), TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs also showed nearly no difference from WT BMDMs in response to IAV PR8 infection; both BMDMs robustly produced IFN\u03b2 (Fig. 6h) . We further examined whether TRIM56 was involved in the host's response to positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses. WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs showed no significant differences in the magnitude of IFN\u03b2 mRNA induction upon infection of positivestrand RNA flavivirus such as Zika virus and Dengue virus ( Supplementary Fig. 9a) . Furthermore, a positive-strand RNA alphavirus (Sindbis virus) and a negative-strand RNA virus (Parainfluenza virus) also induced IFN\u03b2 mRNA at similar levels between WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 9b) . We also showed that WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs showed similar levels of IFN\u03b1 production upon infection with Sindbis virus or Parainfluenza virus ( Supplementary Fig. 9c ). Furthermore, WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs showed similar levels of IFN\u03b2 production upon infection of Flavivirus (Zika virus or Dengue virus), Sindbis virus, or Parainfluenza virus (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e) . WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs were infected with Sindbis virus and viral titers were then measured at different time points using a standard plaque-formation assay on Vero cells. This showed similar viral titers of Sindbis virus in WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 9f) . Finally, WT and TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs also showed similar viral RNA loads of ZIKV MR766 strain or H/PF2013 strain during 48 h infection periods ( Supplementary Fig. 9g) . These comprehensive results demonstrate that TRIM56 is critical for the IFN response against DNA virus infection but appears to be not required for negativeand positive-strand RNA virus infection.",

Among these, cGAS has been recognized as a primary cytosolic DNA sensor that initiates STING-dependent downstream signaling in multiple cell types upon DNA stimulation. Given the demanding interest in cGAS DNA sensor activity, its regulatory mechanisms have been also extensively investigated 22 . Particularly, posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, have been shown to be central in regulating the cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune response 22 . Here we showed that TRIM56 induced the Lys335 monoubiquitination of cGAS, which resulted in a marked increase of its dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production of cGAS. Consequently, TRIM56-deficient cells and mice were defective in cGAS-mediated IFN\u03b1\u03b2 production upon HSV-1 infection but not to IAV infection. This indicates that TRIM56-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS is critical for cytosolic DNA sensing and IFN\u03b1\u03b2 production to induce anti-DNA viral immunity.",

            "text": "Several pieces of evidence substantiate the crucial function of TRIM56 in activating the cytosolic cGAS DNA sensing pathways. TRIM56 interacted with cGAS through its uncharacterized C-terminal NHL homology domain. The NHL repeat, named after NCL1-HT2A-Lin41, is found in a large number of serine/threonine protein kinases in a diverse range of pathogenic bacteria. Interestingly, similar to TRIM56, the Drosophila melanogaster Brat protein also carries a N-terminal RING domain, one or two B-box motifs, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal NHL domain 29 . This C-terminal \u03b2-propeller-shaped NHL domain has been shown to bind RNA in a sequence-specific manner to direct differentiation of neuronal stem cells 43, 44 . It is possible that TRIM56 also uses the C-terminal NHL homologous region to tether the cGAS for ubiquitination. On the other hand, cGAS utilizes its N-terminal RD for interaction with TRIM56. While the physiological function of the N-terminal RD of cGAS is largely uncharacterized, a recent report has demonstrated that the N-terminal RD helps full-length cGAS to expand the binding range on DNA and increases dsDNAbinding efficiency, enzyme activity, and activation of STING/ IRF3-mediated cytosolic DNA signaling 45 . Consistent to this, TRIM56 interaction resulted in the marked increase of cGAS dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production, indicating that TRIM56 is an important signaling molecule for the DNA sensing pathway.",

We identified cGAS as a substrate of TRIM56 and also defined TRIM56 as a potent enhancer of cGAS signaling activity. TRIM56 induced the monoubiquitination of the cGAS Lys335 residue located on the interaction surface, and this monoubiquitination resulted in the marked increase of cGAS dimerization and DNA-binding activity. We primarily observed the monoubiquitinated form of cGAS from in vitro and in vivo TRIM56-mediated cGAS ubiquitination assays. Zhang et al. 40 have shown that the Lys335 residue of mouse cGAS not only mediates DNA binding but also interacts with the Glu398 of the adjacent protomer. Thus we speculate that the TRIM56-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS Lys335 may reinforce the interaction between two cGAS protomers, leading to stable dimerization and subsequently enhancing DNAbinding ability. Future analysis of the cGAS-TRIM56 complex will provide new structural understanding of how TRIM56mediated monoubiquitination affects cGAS dimerization and DNA-binding activity.",

Here we also demonstrated that depleting TRIM56 expression significantly reduced IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression induced by DNA stimulation or HSV-1 infection, but not IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression induced by cGAMP stimulation (Fig. 2) . This indicates that TRIM56 is a genuine antiviral modulator that functions upstream of STING, ultimately protecting the hosts from microbial or DNA viral infection. Next, TRIM56 has been shown to be a restriction factor of several RNA viruses, including IAV, in both an E3 ligase-dependent manner and -independent manner [29] [30] [31] . However, all previous studies were limited to in vitro cell line assays. Using TRIM56 \u2212/\u2212 primary cells and mice, we unambiguously demonstrate that TRIM56 is critical for the in vitro and in vivo IFN response against HSV-1 infection but not against IAV infection. However, we cannot rule out that, besides targeting cGAS, TRIM56 may have additional functions that direct responses to certain RNA virus infections. In fact, TRIM56 has been also shown to interact with TRIF to enhance the TLR3 signaling pathway 46 as well as S. typhimurium SopA HECT-type E3 ligase to modulate inflammatory responses 32 . Kane et al. 47 has recently reported an ISG screening that uncovered the TRIM56 gene as an important player in STINGindependent antiviral activity. Furthermore, TRIM56 is deleted in some splenic marginal zone lymphomas 48 , and its expression is considerably altered in primary effusion lymphomas 49 . Further work will help identify the cGAS-dependent or -independent functions of TRIM56 in host antimicrobial immunity and cancer.",

To clone mouse TRIM56, we purchased an expressing plasmid (Addgene). Mouse TRIM56-V5 constructs were created by subcloning the PCR products into pEF-IRES-puro. Mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR was used to create mouse TRIM56 Mut, which was subcloned into pEF-IRES-puro. Primers used for cloning are presented in Supplementary Table 1 . The constructs were sequenced by Genewiz and were identical to reference TRIM56 sequences except for the defined mutations. HEK293T (ATCC; CRL-3216), L929 WT (ATCC; CCL-1), L929 cGAS knockout 36 , and Vero cells (ATCC; CCL-81) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL) containing 4 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T, L929, and Vero cells are authenticated by ATCC and were not further validated in our laboratory. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines stably expressing cGAS were generated using a standard selection protocol with 2 \u00b5g/ml of puromycin (Invitrogen). Target sequences to generate stable cell lines are presented in Supplementary Table 2 . All cell lines used during these studies tested negative in bi-monthly mycoplasma screening.",

Specifically, the HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 mutant strain was used since the GADD34 homology-containing ICP34.5 effectively counteracts the type I IFN response by binding four cellular proteins, Beclin-1, TBK1, protein phosphatase 1\u03b1, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1[37][38][39] .To further dissect the role of TRIM56, WT, TRIM56(+) cGAS (\u2212), TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(+), or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) L929 cells were stably transfected with an ISRE-IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven secreted luciferase reporter, followed by stimulation with HT-DNA, pdAdT, pdGdC, pI:C, or cGAMP. TRIM56(+) cGAS(\u2212), TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(+), or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) cells also failed to induce ISRE-IFN\u03b2 promoter-luciferase expression upon HT-DNA, pdA:dT, or pdG:dC stimulation, but they effectively induced ISRE-luciferase expression upon pI:C or cGAMP stimulation(Fig. 2e). Finally, these cells were infected with HSV-1 or an RNA virus, Sendai virus (SeV), followed by measurement of the ISRE-IFN\u03b2 promoter-luciferase activity. While wild-type L929 cells markedly induced ISRE-IFN\u03b2 promoter-luciferase expression upon HSV-1\u0394ICP34.5 infection, TRIM56(+) cGAS(\u2212), TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(+), or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) L929 cells showed defective ISRE-IFN\u03b2 promoter-luciferase expression under the same conditions(Fig. 2f). In contrast, all L929 cell lines effectively induced ISRE promoter-luciferase expression upon SeV infection(Fig. 2f). After mock or HT-DNA treatment, WT, TRIM56(+) cGAS(\u2212), TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(+), or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) cell lysates were added into digitoninpermeabilized THP1-Lucia\u2122 ISG reporter cells to perform a cGAMP bio-assay(Fig. 2g). Stimulation with WT L929 cell lysates led to a significant increase of cGAMP-mediated IFN responsiveness of THP1-Lucia\u2122 ISG reporter cells(Fig. 2h). In contrast, stimulation with TRIM56(+) cGAS(\u2212), TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(+), or TRIM56(\u2212) cGAS(\u2212) cell lysates showed little or no increase of cGAMP-mediated IFN responsiveness(Fig. 2h).",
