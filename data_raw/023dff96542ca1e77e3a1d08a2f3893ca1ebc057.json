Gene annotation of this MHC was completed and identified 183 possible coding regions, 147 human homologues, possible functional genes and 36 pseudo/unidentified genes) by GENSCAN and BLASTN, BLASTP RepeatMasker programs. The first region spans 2.976 Mbp sequence, which encodes six classical class II antigens (three DRA and three DRB antigens) lacking the functional DP, DQ regions, nine antigen processing molecules (DOA/DOB, DMA/DMB, TAPASIN, and LMP2/ LMP7,TAP1/TAP2), 52 class III genes, nineteen class I genes/gene fragments (FLAI-A to FLAI-S). Three class I genes (FLAI-H, I-K, I-E) may encode functional classical class I antigens based on deduced amino acid sequence and promoter structure. The second region spans 0.362 Mbp sequence encoding no class I genes and 18 cross-species conserved genes, excluding class I, II and their functionally related/associated genes, namely framework genes, including three olfactory receptor genes. One previously identified feline endogenous retrovirus, a baboon retrovirus derived sequence (ECE1) and two new endogenous retrovirus sequences, similar to brown bat endogenous retrovirus (FERVmlu1, FERVmlu2) were found within a 140 Kbp interval in the middle of class I region. MHC SNPs were examined based on comparisons of this BAC sequence and MHC homozygous 1.96WGS sequences and found that 11,654 SNPs in 2.84 Mbp (0.00411 SNP per bp), which is 2.4 times higher rate than average heterozygous region in the WGS (0.0017 SNP per bp genome), and slightly higher than the SNP rate observed in human MHC (0.00337 SNP per bp).",

            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most extensively analyzed regions in the genome due to the fact that this region encodes the most important molecules in immune function, namely class I and class II antigens, and also other important molecules such as chemical sensing genes (olfactory receptor gene complex), its escort gene, and POU5F1 gene involved in iPS stem cells [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recently, the human MHC, HLA haplotypes were sequenced in the HLA haplotype project [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Eight different HLA -homozygous haplotypes' DNA sequences were determined in order to shed a light on MHC-linked diseases and evolutionary history. These BAC-based sequencings are necessary to examine the details in the regions of the genome, where gene duplications, deletions and selections occurred many times, because the genome project, especially in the human genome, was carried out using a mixture of DNA sources [11] . The same will be true in genome projects in other outbred species. The domestic cat serves excellent animal models to study at least three RNA viruses in humans. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) shares similarly to human leukemia viruses (HTLV I & II) [12] . Feline immunodeficiency virus is considered to cause similar symptoms to human AIDS in a natural host, the domestic cat [13] [14] [15] [16] . Feline infectious peritonitis virus belongs to the same virus group (corona virus) as human SARS virus [17] . To study host-defense mechanisms, in this animal model, we previously analyzed and reported (i) approximately 750 kbp class II region in feline MHC (FLA) [18] , (ii) the unique FLA structure with a single chromosomal split at the TRIM gene family region, and chromosome inversion [19] , and (iii) comparison of three MHCs, HLA, DLA, and FLA using human sequence, canine MHC homozygous genomic sequence and feline 3.3 Mbp draft sequence based on BAC shotgun sequences [20] . In this manuscript, much detail of FLA gene contents, promoter structures of predicted functional class I and class II genes, proportional scale comparisons of four mammalian MHCs (domestic cat, human, mouse, dog) and one marsupial MHC (opossum) are presented. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) between the MHC homozygous sequence of the lightly covered (1.96) domestic cat genome shotgun sequence and this BAC-based MHC sequence were also analyzed to compare the degree and mode of the MHC divergence. In addition, two haplotype BAC-based sequences in functional class II DR region in the domestic cat were analyzed.",

Shotgun libraries were made using the sonication method [18] . Sequencing reactions were made from both ends of the plasmid vector using BigDye v1.0 chemistry (ABI). Electrogram files (ab1 files) were ftptransferred to an ABCC ncisgi high speed computer, analyzed by Phred base caller, assembled by Phrap assembler and finished sequence assembly by Consed13 autofinish programs [22] [23] [24] [25] . The final assembly of these BAC sequence contigs were made using Crossmatch program (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed. html). The following BAC clones were analyzed for class III and proximal, central class I FLA regions in fcaB2qcen; 181p11, 116b21, 539f24, 162h14, 207i7, 20f19, 18a04, 141b1, 97q9, 410h15, 261j7, 469m20, 515g14, 167d5, 117c16, 27j10, 194g24, 253j16, 292m22, 455a7, 454a5, 148o13, 117e16, 329i22. The following BAC clones were analyzed for class I distal region in fcaB2pter with the order from a telomere of fcaB2 short arm, 46j10, 596j24, 269n17, 221p5. More than sequence quality value 20 was used for the final assembly. The first assembly from class III through central class I regions was connected with previously published [18] class II region sequence (758 Kbp) using Crossmatch program.",

These analyses, DLA vs. HLA ( Figure 3A) , FLA vs. HLA ( Figure 3B ) and FLA vs. DLA ( Figure 3C ) revealed mosaic structures of highly conserved regions (solid lines), gene duplication (square with dots), deletions (spaces between solid lines in one axis but not in other) and divergent regions (broken lines). Figure 3A and 3B showed similar patterns between DLA vs. HLA and FLA vs. HLA, indicating conserved class II, III, and central class I regions plus class I gene amplifications, though the level of class I gene amplification was lower in DLA due to the fact that only 3 class I genes exit in HLA-B, -C corresponding region. The observation that DLA and FLA lack HLA-A class I region was also evident in this analysis. Figure 3C also showed that FLA and DLA were highly conserved in gene contents and organization except that the level of class I gene amplification was higher in FLA and sequences around pericentromere and subtelomere had highly divergent sequence due to the numerous and different types of gene translocations from other genome sites, resulting in a large broken solid line in these regions. Endogenous retrovirus sequences. One of the baboonderived endogenous retroviruses, ECE1 (RD114) which had 99% sequence identity (1631/1633) with GenBank RD114 (ECE1) AF155060 and two new types of endogenous retroviruses FERVmlu1 and 2, which showed high sequence similarity with recently submitted sequences by an NISC Comparative Sequencing Initiative project of brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) BAC clone (95% sequence identity with 83% coverage, and .85% sequence identity with 83% coverage, respectively) were also recognized within 1401kb region (Figure 4 ). Detailed open reading frame (ORF) analyses showed FERVmlu1 and 2 have 140 and 19 ORFs which sizes range from 102-900 and 102-516, respectively. The largest ORF of FERVmlu1 encodes 324 amino acid residues which have 70% similarity to a part of recombinant mouse-MuLV/RaLV Pol region, half of retroviral aspartyl protease, DNA binding region and a half of putative active site, however, other ORFs have no significant homology to gag, pol, env regions.",

            "text": "We previously constructed a composite nucleotide sequence of the domestic cat MHC class II region spanning 758 kb from HSET to BTLII that included the DR region [18] . As shown in Figure 6A the DR region spans approximately 250 Kb and consists of 3 DRA and 4 DRB genes, both gene families are encoded by 5 exons with the exception of DRB2 which lacks the full complement of exons and thus represents a pseudogene. We determined the sequence of the second haplotype of a domestic cat DR region using BAC clones (152n13-244j14-16i4) from a single individual. The DR haplotype 2 contained three complete DRA genes (DRA1, DRA2 and DRA3), five DRB genes (four complete and one partial) similar to DRB4, DRB1, DRB3 and DRB2 plus new DRB gene, namely DRB5 as well as a BTLII gene all with the same order and orientation as observed in the DR haplotype 1 (except DRB5 adjacent to DRB1 with same orientation) ( Figure 6B ). To determine if DRB1 and DRB4 also displayed allelic variation, we aligned the genomic sequences of DRB1, 3 and 4 in the region of exon 2 and flanking introns 1 and 2. To assign these exon 2 sequences to specific DRB alleles we compared them to 71 different domestic cat DRB exon 2 alleles of 238 bp in length present in the NCBI nucleotide sequence database (nr/nt). The results summarized in Figure 6B show that DR haplotype 2 contains DRB3 exon 2 identical to DRB*0504 whereas DR haplotype 1 contained a DRB3 exon 2 that differed by 2 bp from DRB*0204, and thus represents a new domestic cat DRB allele (DRB*0204_new1) but differ from nucleotides of 70 nts between DR hap1 and DR hap2. Similarly, DRB1 exon2 sequences in haplotypes 1 and 2 contain the alleles which were identical to DRB*0511 and DRB*0403, respectively, but differ in 31 nucleotides of 233 nts. In addition, haplotype 1 was also positive for DRB4 which showed 229/233 nucleotide sequence identities with DRB*0107_new1. In contrast, the haplotype 2 DRB4 sequence was identical (233/233) to DRB*0107. The DR haplotype 2 contains additional DRB genes designated DRB5 that was not observed in haplotype 1 that displays identical exon 2 sequences with DRB*0212. In summary, this data show that a single domestic cat (Fca273) contains three or four DRB genes in the order DRB4-DRB1-(DRB5)-DRB3, that the three loci are heterozygous, and resolve into 2 distinct haplotypes consisting of DRB*0107_new1-DRB*0511-DRB*0204_new1 (haplotype 1) and DRB*0107-DRB*0403-DRB*0212-DRB*0504 (haplotype 2). Dotplot analysis confirmed this conclusion, indicating duplicated DRB genes adjacent to DRB1 gene (Figure 7) . Deduced amino acid sequences of above alleles were compared in each DRB loci ( Figure 6C ). Of these loci, DRB1 alleles were the most polymorphic containing 23 different residues. DRB3 was the second most polymorphic loci, maintaining 17 different residues. In contrast, DRB4 had only one amino acid substitution.",

Figure 8A depicts the result of DRA genes. All three feline DRA genes have CCAAT-box. The DRA1 and DRA2 genes have striking similarity with TF binding sites up to about 4 kb upstream of ATG site and at least NF-Y binding site, indicating recent gene duplication. In contrast, the DRA3 gene has distinct TF binding sites from the other two genes and is relatively similar to those of the human DRA gene, (e.g., NFY-RFX1-RFX1 sites, Oct-1 sites, sox-9 sites). It may be suggested that the expression pattern is different in these two groups of DRA genes. Figure 8B depicts the difference between TF binding sites in feline DRB1, -3, -4 genes, and human DRB1 and -3. All of these genes lack the CCAAT-box site. The NF-Y site was found in FLA-DRB1, DRB4, and HLA-DRB3. However, no apparent similar TF binding site patterns were found. In class I genes, all predicted feline classical class I genes have a CCAAT-box site plus a unit of AP1-HNF4-Pax-4 sites adjacent to the CCAAT-box ( Figure 8C ). FLA I-H, I-K had relatively similar TF binding sites (e.g., Pax-4-Pax4, Evi-1, FOXD3-COMP1-Hand1/E47, Nkx2-5). Human HLA-B, -C had relatively similar TB binding sites (e.g., CCAATbox, Oct1, Evi-1-FOXD3, Evi-1) however, the HLA-A gene had no CCAAT-box and was quite different in TF site pattern from HLA-B, -C genes.

The MHC region spanning from KIFC (except mouse H2 which has a translocation in this region, so that H2 here compared from Rps 28) to UBD plus 3 olfactory receptor genes was compared in these MHCs. The result depicts striking similarity in gene contents and order of framework genes from marsupial through mammalian evolution. Three MHC (opossum, human, and mouse) have one contiguous gene content, suggesting depiction of an ancestral form of MHC, while two MHC (cat and dog) have a same split form of MHC at TRIM31 and TRIM26 in the class I region as compared with human HLA. In dog MHC, these two pieces were located on two chromosomes (cfa12qcen, cfa35qter), while in cat MHC, these were located on a single chromosome by an inversion (FcaB2 qcen, FcaB2pter) as previously described [19] . Further, two class I genes in dog MHC were located with two additional chromosomes (cfa7, cfa18). The size variation of MHC from about 3.3 Mbp (cat and dog excluding percentromeric, subtelomeric regions) to about 5 Mbp in opossum was also seen in this analysis. The difference in size observed here is mainly due to the magnitude of class I gene amplification and size of class II/III border regions. Cat MHC consists of 650 Kbp class I gene region, spanning from BAT1 to POU5F1 maintaining 17 class I genes/gene fragments, while human and dog MHC have only 2-3 class I genes in this region. Mouse H2 has 7 class I genes and there are no class I genes in opossum MHC in this region. Accordingly, class I gene amplification seemed to have occurred in a species-specific fashion. Additional evidences that e.g. opossum MHC, class I genes were amplified in the class II region, human HLA have at least 11 class I genes in the HLA-A region between the ZNRD1 and MOG genes and in mouse H2, at least 15 class I genes were found between Abcf1 and Trim26 genes, all support adaptive evolution of this importance immune system. Interestingly, the sizes of class II/III border regions vary in each MHC. Cat and dog MHC have approximately 400 Kbp in these regions. In cat MHC, this region was occupied with LINE repeats however, in dog and opossum there are multiple BTNL genes. These evidences reaffirmed the dynamic nature of evolution and maintenance of genome organizations in MHC. Figure 9 . Comparisons of MHC genomic structures in cat, human, mouse, dog, and opossum. Framework genes in class II, III, I regions were shown as green, blue, red boxes, respectively. Forward and reverse orientations of each gene were shown above and below line, respectively.
