For each sentinel dataset, we created two composite variables from the product of weekly ILI data and the relevant laboratory data, indicating the proportion of tested specimens that were positive. For all datasets, including the composite datasets, we aligned data on the median week of peak influenza or ILI activity and assigned three threshold levels: seasonal threshold, determined by inspection; and two intensity thresholds termed average and alert thresholds, determined by calculations of means, medians, confidence intervals (CI) and percentiles. From the thresholds, we compared the seasonal onset, end and intensity across all datasets from 2002-2011. Correlation between datasets was assessed using the mean correlation coefficient.",

In temperate regions of Australia, seasonal influenza outbreaks usually occur between late autumn and early spring and are associated with an increase in disease burden and utilisation of health service [3, 4] . Due to differences in circulating viruses, population immunity and environmental factors, the onset, duration and severity of a season may differ from year to year [2, 5] . Ongoing monitoring of influenza is therefore needed to determine the onset and severity of seasons and to monitor changes in disease trends. Surveillance which involves laboratory testing can add to data on virus characteristics.",

The methods vary in their complexity and can use either short-term or longer historical data to create time-varying or fixed thresholds. There is currently no gold standard or consensus for calculating thresholds. The simplest method uses visual inspection of historical data to create a fixed threshold used throughout the year [13] . Other methods include regression models [14] [15] [16] [17] , time series methods [15] , calculation of means and medians [18] [19] [20] and adaptation of industrial control processes such as Shewhart charts [21] , Cumulative Sum (CuSum) [15, 18, 22] and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average [23] . The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calculates the baseline for their influenzalike-illness (ILI) surveillance by adding two standard deviations to the mean percentage of ILI visits during non-influenza weeks for the previous three seasons, with non-influenza weeks defined as periods with less than 2% of the year's total positive specimens for influenza for \u2265 2 consecutive weeks [24] . In Victoria, the General Practice Sentinel Surveillance (GPSS) for ILI has historically relied on thresholds determined by inspection [13] .",

For the average threshold, we found the peak mean values for the GPSS, test positive influenza and VAED were similar to the median but the peak mean was higher for the MMDS and MMDS composite due to the high call out proportion in 2003. We therefore use the peak mean to define (Table 1) . To set the alert thresholds, the peak 90% CI upper limit was used as we found the parameter to be similar to the peak 95 th percentile across all six datasets (Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The geometric means and 90% CI upper limits from log-transformed data also produced similar parameters (data not shown).",

In practice, another point of consideration for the setting of the alert threshold may be a level of influenza activity that corresponds to an increased demand on the health care system [7] .

By incorporating a laboratory component to the ILI measure, the use of the composite variable appeared to improve the specificity and agreement between VAED and ILI surveillance data. The finding is consistent with emerging literature that these composite variables may be a better proxy indicator of influenza incidence than either ILI or LAB data alone [36, 37] .

These changes were not reflected in the ILI or LAB datasets. While there may be a number of possible explanations, such as changes in testing behaviours or disease coding, a recent study investigating the increase in out-ofseason influenza in Australia suggests a genuine increase in influenza activity, combined with increased testing that occurred following the pandemic [38] . This may reflect an increased awareness of influenza in hospitalised patients among health professionals after the pandemic. Additionally, surveillance data at VIDRL indicate that approximately 40% of patients with an influenza-like illness were swabbed prior to 2009 [26] but this rose to 70% during the 2009 pandemic [39] and has since remained at about this proportion [9] .",

For example, a short-term acute rise in influenza cases that marginally exceed the alert threshold does not correspond to a gradual or persistent elevated level of activity that may represent a higher disease burden. Finally, when we compared the current parameters to the previous threshold based on seven years of historical ILI data from 1994-2000 in Victoria, the baseline threshold for the GPSS was lower at 2 per 1000 cases compared with the revised threshold of 4 and the alert threshold was higher at 35 per 1000 cases compared with the revised threshold of 24 [13] .",
