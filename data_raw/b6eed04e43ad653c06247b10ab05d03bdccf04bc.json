The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.",

In addition, the household provides a ''laboratory'' within which key measures of transmission such as infectiousness, generation time and the effect of immunity or vaccination can be studied [1] . In recent years considerable effort has gone into understanding the dynamics of transmission within populations organised into households using mathematical models [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . Most effort has gone into analysing the asymptotic behaviour of these models, elucidating the threshold levels of transmission required for infection to be self-sustaining, calculating final epidemic sizes, or predicting the impact of generalised or targeted interventions designed to reduce or eliminate transmission. In parallel, methods have been derived to estimate the parameters which govern transmission within the household from detailed case reports [7, 8, 9, 10] . However, scant effort appears to have been paid to how to apply household structured models to the analysis of epidemics, either retrospectively or in real time.",

The aim of this study is to develop methods of a perhaps ''slightly less simple but still tractable'' variety that capture some of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important, but which can be rapidly applied (say on a daily basis) in an emerging outbreak situation, to inform policy. More specifically, the aim is to arrive at a method to estimate the key transmission and control parameters for a model of transmission within and between households from as few detailed observations as are likely to be gathered in the heat of a major outbreak.",

Extensive effort is, and should continue to be, spent on identifying the conditions where different types of simplification (household models, static network models, spatial metapopulation models\u2026) can and can't be justified, and in developing analytical approximations to describe disease transmission within such simplified structures.",

The individual reproduction number R (t ) is defined roughly as the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan; as I will show below, there are several ways of defining this more precisely. The household reproduction number R * (t ) is defined here as the average number of households a household infected at time t can infect [3, 6] . The individual reproduction number R (t ) rightly plays a privileged role in epidemiology, as it is a meaningful measure within any contact network. However, of the possible summary measures of epidemic progress, it is not necessarily the most useful. For example, for an emerging directly transmitted pathogen, such as pandemic influenza virus, public health interventions may target the household rather than the individual, enforcing household quarantine as well as offering antivirals to the household to limit transmission within the household. In such a situation, the household reproduction number R * (t ) is more directly related to the parameters which characterize the intervention, and is thus a better measure of the effect of these interventions. These quantities (R (t ) and R * (t )) share the two essential properties of reproduction numbers, namely that they increase when infectiousness increases and decrease when infectiousness decreases (monotonicity), and that they mark a threshold that separates exponentially growing epidemics (when R (t ).1 or equivalently R * (t ).1) from exponentially declining epidemics (when R (t ),1 or equivalently R * (t ),1) [3, 6] .",

A disadvantage is that it can be harder to include heterogeneities.

It is commonly a single peaked function reflecting pathogen growth followed by immune suppression, or host death, but can be more exotic such as the double peaked profile associated with early and late transmission of HIV [22] , or the repeated peaks of malaria [23] . b (t, t) also reflects the effective contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, which can change during the course of a single infection, increasing for example if a person coughs or sneezes due to respiratory disease, or decreasing if a person takes to bed with illness, and during the course of the epidemic as public health measures are implemented. More discussions of the components (infectiousness and contact) of b (t, t) can be found in [24] . Because I am interested in outbreaks of emerging infections, I will not describe explicitly reductions in the susceptible population caused by the epidemic. Formally this corresponds to working in the infinite population limit. This assumption is not essential for this section however, since b (t, t) could also be thought of as incorporating the proportion of cases that are susceptible; the assumption becomes more important in the later sections on household models.",

Second, right censoring can cause the observed generation times to be shorter or longer than expected for a growing or declining epidemic, respectively [26] . Third, as apparent here, if the reproduction number R (t) changes due to depletion of susceptibles, changes in contact rates or public health measures, then this will also change the observed generation times for infectious individuals during that period of change. Thus the distribution w (t) is really intended as a measure of infectiousness which will correspond to generation times for an index case in an ideal large closed setting where contact rates are constant. It can be inferred from data on the timing of cases, as in [10, 13] .",

Right censoring is not however the only complication associated with estimating reproduction numbers in practice, and is not completely absent from (7) due to the delay in detecting infections.

Because, as I have shown, the linearised Kermack-McKendrick model is applicable even when susceptibility and infectiousness are heterogeneous, this method is acceptable despite the fact that households may be quite heterogeneous in size and in the number of people infected. One analogous situation where this approach has been used is in estimating farm-to-farm reproduction numbers in the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth virus epidemic [27] . However, unless specifically tailored to this task, it is unlikely the data will be collected in the requisite form for this approach to be used in the human household situation.

The link between the two can be thought of as the function b (t, t) which translates the impact of changing processes within the host into changing infectiousness as a function of time since infection. The approach taken here to modelling household transmission is to study a three-level hierarchical model of transmission. The three levels are within-host, within-household, and between households. The natural history of infection is described by the individual infectiousness function b (t, t). I assume in this section that individuals are homogenous in infectiousness and susceptibility. I then use this to predict the course of epidemics within households, and derive a function b * (t, t * ) which describes the average infectiousness of a household towards other households as a function of the time since the household was infected, t * (from here-on, I use the starred symbols to denote properties of households, and un-starred symbols to denote properties of individuals). The basic idea behind this analysis is illustrated in Fig 1. To simplify the notation, and because the main aim of this section is to study the case of an epidemic growing exponentially, I consider the situation where infectiousness is independent of calendar time t. This could be relaxed, though only if variation in time is somewhat slower than the typical duration of infection within a household.",

Q n is the escape probability of each infectious-susceptible pair of individuals considered in isolation. In the formalism proposed by Ludwig, this corresponds to using infectious rank as a surrogate for infectious generation [33] .

Because of the general form of the relation between generation time and reproduction number seen in equation (12) , this will result in over-estimates of the household reproduction number R * (r). To provide a counter-balancing under-estimate of R * (r), I also consider an alternative approximation obtained by assuming the same total number of cases as predicted by this Reed-Frost model, but where all cases are assumed to be infected by the first index case. This is not a formal lower bound, since in the limit of infinite infectiousness within the household, all members of the household will be infected simultaneously upon introduction of the infection into the household.

            "text": "There are two reasons for considering household structure in analysing the pandemic influenza situation. First, influenza transmission is known to be concentrated within the household, and thus parameter estimates which ignore this heterogeneity are likely to be frail. Second, many public health policies for future pandemics are likely to be organised around the household. The net effect of social distance measures such as school and workplace closures and cancellation of social gatherings is effectively to reduce transmission out of households (and perhaps inadvertently to increase transmission within them). Furthermore, antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and quarantine measures are likely to be targeted at whole households rather than individuals (though restricting families with one suspect case to stay together without any other support is possibly undesirable) [16, 17, 20] . A number of studies have identified the parameters needed to estimate the household reproduction number for influenza [8, 10, 11, 17] . It is important to bear in mind that these parameters could be quite different in future pandemics, and thus that robust methodology may be more useful in responding to new outbreaks than numerical estimates obtained for past outbreaks. While it would be straightforward to use demographic data and exponential growth rates from earlier pandemics combined with interpandemic data on the transmissibility of influenza within households to obtain estimates of R * for historical pandemics, it has not been shown that the within household transmission parameters for inter-pandemic influenza adequately describe the pandemic situation, so I focus instead on providing illustrative examples using current demographic data (on the household size distribution from the UK) [34], and recent data on the transmissibility of influenza in modern households [10] .",

The former study followed seronegative households for a two week winter outbreak of seasonal influenza. The corresponding escape probabilities are Q 2 = 50.9% (i.e. the probability of not being infected by the other household member in a household of size two is 50.9%), Q 3 = 63.8%, Q 4 = 71.4%, Q 5 = 76.4% and Q 6 = 79.9%. On the scale of other infections, this places influenza as being approximately as infectious as mumps, but a lot less infectious than either varicella-zoster or measles [1] . By applying the Reed-Frost model to these data with this distribution of households, I obtain estimates of the average number of infections in each generation of infection of m 1 u 1, m 2 = 0.64 (i.e. the first index case directly infects an average of 0.64 people in his or her household), m 3 = 0.19, m 4 = 0.036, m 5 = 0.0037 and m 6 = 0.00021, and thus the estimate for the total expected number of cases in an infected household is m = S 6 i = 1 m i = 1.87, to be compared to the mean size of 3.06.

Based on this growth rate, the estimated individual reproduction number is R = 1.74, while the estimated household reproduction number is R * = 2.26, and thus the out-of-household reproduction number is R G = 1.21. Of course, households were bigger in 1918 than now, so that the actual value of R * was likely higher than this. These estimates would imply that a proportion 121/R * = 56% of between household transmission would need to be blocked to prevent epidemic spread.

This analysis is perhaps a little artificial when applied to measles, since a large proportion of the population will have immunity either due to past infection or vaccination with the live MMR vaccine. The principal motivation is to further test and illustrate the methods in a case where good data on the transmission dynamics within households are available. Stratification by household of the recent outbreaks of measles caused by decreasing uptake of the MMR vaccine could reveal whether household heterogeneities should have be accounted for in estimating the changing reproduction number of measles [36] .",

''Approx 1'' is the main approximation described, while ''Approx 2'' is the one obtained by assuming that all infections occur in the second generation of infection within the household.

What this study does highlight is that much complexity is hidden in effectively defining and estimating the generation time distribution for a structured population. In the case studied here, generation times between individuals are shorter for within household transmission than between household transmission, particularly for more infectious pathogens, and this resulted in systematic biases associated with estimating the reproduction number while ignoring this effect, which were quite substantial in the case of highly infectious measles virus.",

The assumption made here, that individuals mix nearly homogeneously out of their household may be an appropriate approximation for describing transmission within a neighbourhood or even a city [20] , but ultimately one should also consider developing the estimators for more complex demographic situations such as a hierarchy of organisations (household, to village, to region, to country, etc\u2026) or a more complex overlap of households, workplaces and regular social spaces. Also of interest is the study of intervention measures, particularly those that respond to the presence of a symptomatic cases; the measures of pre-symptomatic transmission presented in [25] clearly generalise to a household, but analytical results on the efficacy of isolation and quarantine are not evidently obtainable.",

The infectiousness of each individual over time is also shown, with infection events highlighted. B, illustrates how these events can be reinterpreted by taking the unit of infection as the household, infected at time t 0 and with total infectiousness of the household defined as the sum of the four individual curves shown in A. The aim of the method is then to average this process over all possible chains of infection in the household, and all household sizes, to obtain the characteristic infectiousness profile of a household, as shown in C, where the household is no longer decomposed into its constituent units at all. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.",

The estimate for the quantity R G , the average number of people each person infects outside his or her home, is also shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000758.g003",

            "text": "To check the method for consistency, I simulate ten epidemics of influenza (A) and measles (B) within a fully susceptible community of 2,000 households. I use parameters estimated for an epidemic growth rate r = 0.20 per day, and condition on nonextinction of the epidemic. In C and D, the natural logarithm of the incidence is compared to the fixed slope curve r = 0.20 predicted by the model (thick line). Linear regression through these data yields the estimate r = 0.19 in both cases. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000758.g004",
