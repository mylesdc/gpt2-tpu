            "text": "The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses of animals and humans associated mostly with enteric and respiratory diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and 10-20% of all common colds. A subset of CoVs uses the cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN), a membrane-bound metalloprotease, as a cell entry receptor. In these viruses, the envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates the attachment of the virus particles to APN and subsequent cell entry, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe the crystal structures of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of two closely related CoV strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), in complex with their receptor, porcine APN (pAPN), or with a neutralizing antibody. The data provide detailed information on the architecture of the dimeric pAPN ectodomain and its interaction with the CoV S. We show that a protruding receptorbinding edge in the S determines virus-binding specificity for recessed glycan-containing surfaces in the membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain. Comparison of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV to those of other related CoVs, suggests that the conformation of the S receptor-binding region determines cell entry receptor specificity. Moreover, the receptorbinding edge is a major antigenic determinant in the TGEV envelope S that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide a compelling view on CoV cell entry and immune neutralization, and may aid the design of antivirals or CoV vaccines. APN is also considered a target for cancer therapy and its structure, reported here, could facilitate the development of anti-cancer drugs.",

The peplomers have a globular portion connected by a protein stalk to the transmembrane domain [6] . The globular region is formed by the N-terminal S1 region, whereas the stalk corresponds to the membrane-proximal S2 region, which mediates virus fusion to host cells and adopts a helical structure characteristic of class I virus fusion proteins [7] . Determinants of CoV tropism locate at the S1 region [1, 8] , which mediates attachment of CoV particles to cell surface molecules, initiating virus entry into cells and infection. There is considerable variability in receptor usage among the CoVs. Most Alphacoronavirus such as TGEV and HCoV-229E use APN [9, 10] , whereas the related HCoV-NL63 uses a distinct cell entry receptor, the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11] ; SARS-CoV also recognizes the ACE2 receptor [12] . SARS and NL63 CoV bind to common regions of the ACE2 protein, although the structures of their receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are quite distinct [11, 13] . MHV uses the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1a [14] ; a recent crystal structure showed that the MHV RBD adopts a galectin-like fold [8] . The use of alternative receptors that confer extended tropism has been described for SARS-CoV, MHV and TGEV [1, 8] .",

The APN-binding domain in TGEV, PRCV and other Alphacoronavirus locates at the C-terminal portion of the S1 region [8, 22, 23] , which bears epitopes recognized by CoV-neutralizing antibodies [22, 23, 24, 25] . Most TGEV-neutralizing antibodies cluster at antigenic site A [25, 26] , comprised within the RBD at the S1 region ( Figure 1A ) [22] ; the other antigenic sites defined in the TGEV S1 region (B through D) are outside the RBD ( Figure 1A ) [21] .",

The RBD adopts a b-barrel fold, with a distinct protruding tip engaged in pAPN recognition. The structures show how these porcine Alphacoronavirus recognize its cell entry pAPN receptor and how immune neutralization of these CoVs is achieved by antibody targeting of receptorbinding residues in the S protein.

In some CoVs, the virus envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates attachment of the virus particles to the host APN protein and cell entry, which is blocked by antibodies that prevent CoV infections. The crystal structures of the S proteins of two porcine CoV in complex with the pig APN (pAPN) or with a neutralizing antibody shown here, reveal how some CoV bind to its cell surface APN receptor and how antibodies prevent receptor binding and infection. The report uncovers a unique virus-receptor recognition mode that engages a glycan N-linked to the pAPN ectodomain, revealing structural determinants of the receptor-binding specificity in CoVs. Neutralizing antibodies target viral residues used for binding to the APN receptor and entry into host cells, showing that efficient CoV neutralization requires immune responses focused toward key receptor binding motifs in the virus envelope. These structural insights, together with the structure of the APN ectodomain, provide a compelling view of relevant cell membrane processes related to infectious diseases and cancer.",

The RBD b1-b2 region contributed 73% of the RBD surface buried by the 1AF10 mAb, and docked between the 1AF10 mAb variable domains ( Figure 2B ). The b-turn is fully buried between the mAb Ig domains ( Figure 2C ), forming a contact network with mAb residues ( Figure 2D ).

Crystals were obtained only with a mixture of a PRCV S protein (S3H) and the pAPN. Using these crystals, we determined the structure of the PRCV RBD-pAPN complex by molecular replacement using previously solved structures of the TGEV RBD shown in Figure 2 (97% sequence identity) and of the pAPN ectodomain (Materials and Methods and Table 1 ). The asymmetric unit of the crystals contained two macromolecular RBD-pAPN complexes ( Figure 3A ). The PRCV RBD adopts a b-barrel fold like the TGEV RBD ( Figure S1 ). Each pAPN molecule was engaged by the tip of a single PRCV RBD molecule, which bears two exposed aromatic residues (Tyr and Trp) ( Figure 3A , in red), and they bound to a membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain ( Figure 3A ). The RBD N-and Cterminal ends and the remaining CoV S are also distant from the pAPN, and are unlikely to contact the receptor molecule. Based on a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV S [6] , the RBD must be also at the viral-membrane distal side of the S and therefore, the receptor binding edge must be accessible for CoV binding to the APN receptor.",

The 25 N-terminal residues of the crystallized pAPN ectodomain are largely disordered in the structure and they might form a flexible region close to the cell membrane. The pAPN ectodomain is composed of four domains ( Figure 3A ). Domain I (orange) is made of b-strands, domain II (yellow) adopts a thermolysin-like fold bearing a zinc ion at the catalytic site, domain III (red) is a small b-barrel domain, and the C-terminal domain IV (green) is composed of alpha-helices (domain boundaries are shown in Figure S2 ). The pAPN molecule structure is closely related to that of the human endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 [30, 31] (root-mean-square deviation of 2.3 \u00c5 for 791 residues sharing 33% sequence identity, based on DALI server). Domain II bearing the enzyme active site is the most related domain (47% identity), whereas domain IV is the most distinct (22% identity). The zinc ion is coordinated to conserved residues at the pAPN active site in domain II ( Figure S2 ). The active site conformation is similar to that of other aminopeptidases ( Figure S3 ). The pAPN crystallized in complex with the PRCV RBD had an open conformation [30, 31, 32] , in which domain IV was ,20-25 \u00c5 from domains I and II; this creates a central cavity in which the zinc ion at the catalytic site is highly accessible ( Figure 3A ).",

In the RBD, each of the two highly twisted b-sheets that build the b-barrel is formed by five b-strands ( Figure 5A ). The bent b-strand 5 (b5) crosses both b-sheets and has a b-bulge at Asn608 ( Figure 5A , magenta). At one side of the b-barrel, all bstrands are antiparallel ( Figure 5A, cyan) , whereas on the opposite A DALI search of structural homologs showed the greatest similarity (Z score of 10) with the RBD of the ACE2 receptorbinding HCoV-NL63 (root-mean-square deviation of 2.4 \u00c5 for 103 residues), the other Alphacoronavirus RBD whose structure is known [11] . The cores of the TGEV and HCoV-NL63 b-barrel domains are structurally similar, but the loops at the tips ( Figure 5B and 5D). The tip region of the HCoV-NL63 RBD is the ACE2 receptor-binding edge and has a ''bowl''-shaped conformation ( Figure 5C ) that differs from the TGEV RBD protruding edge. Aromatic residues protrude from the b-turns at the tip of the bbarrel in TGEV, whereas they are partially buried at the center of the ''bowl''-shaped edge in HCoV-NL63 ( Figure 5B and 5C). The distinct RBD tip conformation in ACE2-binding HCoV-NL63 and in APN-binding TGEV might be a determinant of their distinct cell entry receptor specificities.",

Therefore, TGEV, PRCV, CCoV and FCoV must recognize the APN receptor in similar fashion. In contrast, the receptor-binding loops at the tip appear to have a different conformation from TGEV in the HCoV-229E RBD, which also binds to the APN. In this CoV, the b1-b2 region has two Cys, as in HCoV-NL63, and lacks the APN-binding Tyr residue in Alphacoronavirus 1, although it preserves the two Gly residues found in the TGEV b-turn ( Figure 6 ). The b3-b4 loop in HCoV-229E is markedly shorter than in TGEV, but it also has a Trp residue. Sequence identities between the RBD of TGEV and IBV (Gammacoronavirus) or the Bulbul-CoV (tentative Deltacoronavirus) are relatively large (,25%), and similarities are found mostly in bstrands and at the RBD C-terminal half ( Figure 6) .

To further characterize site A antigenic determinants in the TGEV RBD, we mutated RBD residues targeted by the 1AF10 mAb ( Figure 2 ) and some surrounding residues, and analyzed binding to other site A-specific mAbs. The antigenicity of residues in the b1-b2 region, in the center of the epitope for 1AF10 ( Figure 2C ), was determined by monitoring mAb binding to RBD mutants with TGEV residue substitutions Gly527 (G527D), Tyr528 (Y528A) and Gly529 (G529D) ( Figure 7A ). All three substitutions abolished RBD binding by the Ac subsite-specific mAbs 1AF10 and 6AC3. The Y528A RBD mutant was recognized by Aa-(1BB1) and Ab-specific (1DE7) mAbs ( Figure 7A) , and mAb 1DE7 also bound the G529D mutant.",

Deletion of the b3-b4 turn (LWD572A mutant) reduced 6AC3 mAb binding to the RBD markedly, with a partial reduction in 1AF10 binding ( Figure 7A ); this indicates that mAb 6AC3 recognizes a broader epitope, which correlates with its higher TGEV neutralization activity [25] . Replacement with Ala of RBD residues Thr631 and Asn632 at the b5-b6 hairpin, which contacts the 1AF10 mAb in the RBD-1AF10 structure ( Figure 2C) , reduced binding by all site A-specific mAb ( Figure 7A ).

The RBD-receptor complex structures determined for Alphacoronavirus indicate that the conformation of the receptor binding edge in the envelope S proteins probably determines their receptor-binding specificity. The CoV that bind APN analyzed here have protruding receptorbinding motifs that engage recessed surfaces on the receptor. This mode of receptor recognition is essentially opposite to that reported for CoV binding to the ACE2 receptor, where recessed receptor-binding motifs in the viral RBD cradle exposed surfaces of the ACE2 ectodomain [11, 13] . In the case of pAPN, an Nlinked glycan is also engaged in the virus-receptor interaction. The inherent flexibility of this glycan might facilitate the initial contact of the CoV Tyr residue with APN amino acids, and subsequent virus-receptor interactions could lock the bound Tyr between the glycan and an a-helix ( Figure 3B ). The glycan N-linked to Asn736 in pAPN is also conserved in canine and feline APN proteins ( Figure S2 ), as are the viral S protein residues that interact with this glycan in the RBD b1-b2 and the b5-b6 regions ( Figure 6 ). This unique glycan-virus interaction must thus be conserved among the different CoVs in the species Alphacoronavirus 1, in accordance with the glycan requirement reported for cell infection by CCoV, FCoV, and TGEV/PRCV [20] . The lack of this glycan in human APN ( Figure S2 ) and the absence of the interacting Tyr residue in the b1-b2 region of HCoV-229E RBD ( Figure 6 ) imply distinct virus-APN local contacts in humans. As shown for the Alphacoronavirus 1 group, however, HCoV-229E probably has a protruding receptor-binding edge in the envelope S, responsible for its APN-binding specificity.",

Potent TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, such as the 6AC3 mAb [25] , target key APN-binding residues in the S (Figure 7) , preventing infection. Data from antibody neutralization-resistant TGEV mar mutants nonetheless show that some substitutions can be accommodated in the receptor-binding region of Alphacoronavirus, which confer the ability to escape immune neutralization, while preserving . Substituted residues at the RBD tip that contact pAPN in the PRCV RBD-pAPN structure are shown in Figure 3 , except for the V617Ngly mutant, with a glycan at RBD position 617 in the b5-b5b loop, outside the RBD tip (see Figure 3D) .

Our results thus demonstrate that the receptor-binding region in Alphacoronavirus is under selective pressure from the immune system, as described for other viruses [34, 35, 36, 37] . It is tempting to speculate that immune pressure on exposed receptor-binding residues in the CoV S could lead to conformational changes in receptor-binding edges of CoV RBDs. This would result either in changes in the APN-recognition mode observed with HCoV-229E and TGEV, or in conformational changes in the RBD tip that lead to a receptor specificity switch for cell entry, as observed for HCoV-NL63 [11] . Virus use of recessed binding regions, as for HCoV-NL63, is a well-defined strategy for hiding conserved receptorbinding residues from antibodies [34, 36] . Like HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV uses a recessed, although broader ACE2-binding surface, which can accommodate mutations that permit crossspecies receptor recognition [13] . It remains to be understood why, despite major changes in the receptor-binding region, all these CoV use metalloproteases as cell entry receptors.",

The domain architecture of APN resembles that of related aminopeptidases [30, 31, 32] . Here we show a unique dimer configuration for the APN, mediated by its domain IV, the most divergent domain among M1 aminopeptidases [31] . The implication of these structural findings for APN biology will require further biochemical analysis. Knowledge of the structure is leading to research on the mechanism of action of numerous anti-tumor compounds that target mammalian APN [19] ; these studies will be fundamental for improving drug specificity. The detailed view of the APN-CoV interaction shown here might also lead to development of small molecules to block CoV infection. We have identified the receptor-binding region as the major antigenic site in the Alphacoronavirus envelope S, which could guide the design of immunogens that boost CoV-neutralizing immune responses to key motifs for virus cell entry.",

The Asn residues at glycosylation sites and the attached glycans defined in the structure are shown as a ball-and-stick model, with carbons in yellow. Cysteine residues and disulfide bonds are shown as green cylinders. Side chains of the pAPN-binding Tyr and Trp residues in the loops at the b-barrel domain tip are shown in red in panels A to C. B. Stereo view of superimposed Alphacoronavirus RBD structures. The pAPN-binding RBD of TGEV is in blue and the ACE2-binding RBD of HCoV-NL63 (PDB ID 3KBH) is in orange. C. Surface representation of the TGEV and HCoV-NL63 RBD structures in B, with receptor-binding residues in pink or red. D.
