            "text": "The emergence of influenza viruses resistant to existing classes of antiviral drugs raises concern and there is a need for novel antiviral agents that could be used therapeutically or prophylacticaly. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) belongs to the family of Ctype lectins which are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with activity against bacteria and viruses, including influenza viruses. In the present study we evaluated the potential of recombinant porcine SP-D as an antiviral agent against influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro. To determine the range of antiviral activity, thirty IAVs of the subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 that originated from birds, pigs and humans were selected and tested for their sensitivity to recombinant SP-D. Using these viruses it was shown by hemagglutination inhibition assay, that recombinant porcine SP-D was more potent than recombinant human SP-D and that especially higher order oligomeric forms of SP-D had the strongest antiviral activity. Porcine SP-D was active against a broad range of IAV strains and neutralized a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs, including 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea, we demonstrated that recombinant porcine SP-D prevented attachment of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It was concluded that recombinant porcine SP-D holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against influenza and further development and evaluation in vivo seems warranted.

In addition to seasonal outbreaks of influenza epidemics in the winter months, novel influenza viruses are occasionally introduced into the human population and cause pandemics. The introduction of IAV of the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes have caused pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 respectively. More recently, H1N1 viruses of swine origin caused the first pandemic of the 21 st century, which started in Mexico in March 2009 [1, 2] . The virus spread rapidly over all continents and caused disease especially in children and young adults [3] .",

Especially individuals with high risk to develop complications of IAV infection benefit from vaccination, like the elderly, patients with chronic diseases and immunocompromised individuals. In addition, vaccination could help to mitigate the impact of a pandemic outbreak. However, there are three scenarios in which vaccination cannot be used effectively. First, certain high risk group respond to vaccination poorly like the frail elderly and certain immunocompromised subjects. Secondly, in case of antigenic mis-match, the vaccine may induce antibodies that fail to neutralize the epidemic strains optimally and therefore do not afford protection against theses drift variants [6, 7] . Finally, in case of a pandemic the vaccines may become available too late as was the case during the 2009 pandemic [2] .",

Furthermore, 15.5% of the H1N1 viruses were resistant to adamantanes in [2005] [2006] worldwide. In addition, most of the seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated in the influenza season 2008-2009 were resistant to oseltamivir [11, 12, 13] . Also during the treatment of especially immunocompromised patients, which shed virus for extensive periods, the emergence of resistant strains can be a complication.",

It is hypothesized that IAV less likely will develop resistance to this class of antiviral molecules since they target glycans present on IAV. SP-D belongs to the collectin family, which is an important class of innate immunity proteins involved in the early response against pathogens. These collagenous C-type lectins are mainly produced by Clara cells and type II pneumocytes. They can neutralize a variety of respiratory pathogens including bacteria and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, SARS coronavirus and IAV (for review see [14] , [15] ). Collectins can bind glycoconjugates expressed on the surface of these pathogens via their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs).",

Unlike its human counterpart, it contains an extra cysteine in the collagen domain, it is Nglycosylated with a sialic acid-rich oligosaccharide in the CRD and there is a potentially important extra loop region (SGA) present in the CRD which could play a role in the sugar-binding properties of pSP-D [19] .

For the development of a collectin-based antiviral drug, the use of a welldefined recombinant product is the most acceptable venue. However, the biological properties of the recombinant protein need to resemble those of the native protein. First, the biochemical properties of RpSP-D were characterized in detail and compared with NpSP-D and it was shown that RpSP-D is structurally and functionally identical to NpSP-D (van Eijk et al., manuscript in preparation). In this study, we focused on the antiviral properties of RpSP-D and compared its IAV-neutralizing activity with that of NpSP-D isolated from pig lungs in the HI assay against a broad panel of IAV strains. The inhibitory activity of both preparations was comparable and dependent on the presence of calcium ions, indicating that we were able to produce a biological active and properly folded recombinant protein.",

Furthermore, RhSP-D failed to inhibit the hemagglutination by swine IAV of the H1N1 subtype.

            "text": "Another potential viral target that could be bound or inhibited by RpSP-D is the NA of IAV. It has been shown previously that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of NA successfully inhibited virus replication and viral spread and a class of existing antiviral drugs is based on this principle. To investigate whether IAV NA, which is also glycosylated, can be inhibited by RpSP-D, we used, in contrast to other studies [33, 35] , recombinant NA molecules to exclude the interference of the enzymatic activity by binding of RpSP-D to HA. Although the enzymatic activity was inhibited to a certain extent, relatively high RpSP-D doses were required to achieve this. We therefore conclude that binding of RpSP-D to the viral HA most likely is a more potent mode of antiviral action than binding to NA. Of note, the reduction of infection of MDCK cells that was observed correlated with the inhibition of the hemagglutination activity of IAV. This provides additional evidence that HA is the primary target of RpSP-D. The interaction of RpSP-D with the viral HA, prevents the attachment of the virus to target cells and is at the basis of the neutralizing effect of RpSP-D. Indeed, we demonstrated that RpSP-D is able of binding HA of influenza A viruses of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtype (Figure 4) . Using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea and virushistochemistry we demonstrated that RpSP-D could reduce binding of human IAV H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to epithelial cells of the human and ferret upper respiratory tract. The binding of virus to paraffin-embedded tissues may not reflect the virus-tissue interaction in vivo exactly. However, the binding patterns of various influenza viruses to respiratory tract tissue obtained from various animal species correlate with pathogenesis and transmissibility of these viruses. This indicates that the patterns of virus-tissue binding assessed by our virushistochemistry method has biological relevance [27, 36, 37, 38] .",

The minimal inhibitory concentration of RpSP-D and NpSP-D required to inhibit the hemagglutination by all 27 H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs was assessed (A). The horizontal line indicates the average of the minimal inhibitory concentration for both preparations which did not differ significantly. The values were also compared directly (B). The minimal inhibition concentrations of RpSP-D correlated well with those of NpSP-D. Each symbol in panels A and B represent an individual IAV strain. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025005.g001",

The minimal inhibitory concentration of RpSP-D that still inhibited the hemagglutination by a variety of IAV was determined. In panel A, the bars represent the average minimal concentration of RpSP-D required to inhibit all H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses tested, independent of the animal species they originated from. Panels B and C show the results of individual H1N1 (B) and H3N2 (C) viruses and their origin. The average concentrations obtained in six independent experiments are shown. The results obtained in four independent experiments with H5N1 viruses, VietNam/04 (open square), Indonesia/05 (closed diamond), HongKong/97 (closed triangle) are shown in panel D. Also the results (the average of three independent experiments) are shown in panel E and F for inhibition by multimers and trimers of RpSP-D. The H1N1 viruses tested are NL/09 (closed diamond), S/NL/1/87 (closed triangle), NJ/76 (closed square), NL/06 (open square), M/NL/06 (closed circle), NL/08 (open circle), WGF/NL/07 (open triangle) (panel E) and the H3N2 viruses tested are S/NL/93 (closed diamond), NL/07 (open square), NL/03 (open triangle), NL/93 (closed triangle), M/NL//08 (open circle), M/Sweden/03 (closed circle), M/NL/07 (closed square) (panel F). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025005.g002",
