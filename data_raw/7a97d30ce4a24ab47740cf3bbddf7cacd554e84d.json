            "text": "In node void percolation, as a link is traversed, void node is removed. The void nodes are removed with probability proportional to kP (k). As the susceptible nodes can be mapped into void node percolation, the susceptible network loses their higher degree nodes first as in an intentional attack. As a consequence, the resulting susceptible network is more homogeneous than the original. Thus, mean field exponents of a second order percolating phase transition [6] are expected. In order to show the effect of the disease spreading on the highest degree nodes, in Fig. S2 we plot for a SF network the effective degree distribution of the susceptible nodes obtained from the simulations, in which a susceptible node has degree k when it has k susceptible neighbors. As shown in Fig. S2 , as the disease spreads, the effective degree distribution loses the heavy tail. As a result of this process, the susceptible clusters becomes more sparse and at the critical time t c the topology of the susceptible clusters change drastically since the susceptible individuals lose all the hubs and P (k) has an exponential tail. For percolation in mean field it is known that at the criticality the finite cluster size distribution n S \u223c s \u2212\u03c4 with \u03c4 = 2.5 and Fig. S3 we plot the simulations results of the finite size distribution of the susceptible nodes n s at t = t c . We can see that at t c , n s (t c ) behaves as a power law with exponent \u03c4 \u2248 2.5 which corresponds to the mean field value, independently of the initial degree distribution of the network [7] . Similarly, in Fig. S4 we plot S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t) obtained from the simulations and the theoretical approach. We compute \u03a6 S (t) from the simulations as the square root of the fraction of edges connecting two susceptible nodes [8] . We can see that S 1 (t) behaves as a power law with exponent one with the distance to the criticality \u03a6 s (t c ), which also corresponds to the mean field value (see Insets of Fig. S4 ). Since two critical exponents are sufficient to determine the universality class, the results showed above indicate that in a node void percolation process the susceptible network belongs to the same universality class of mean field percolation and confirms quantitatively the homogenization of the susceptible network during a SIR epidemic spreading.",

We can see that for the same transmissibility T , when t r increase, the time to intervene grows since \u03b2 decrease and thus the disease spreading is retarded. In turn, when the transmissibility T reaches T * from above, the critical time t c grows very fast. This phenomenon is analogous to other second order phase transitions in physics like the relaxation time near the Curie temperature, which are called \"critical slowing down\" [9, 10] , and indicates that that once the transmissibility increases slightly above T * , the time needed to destroy the giant susceptible cluster decreases very fast.

For the simulations we infect only one individual in the giant component of the network and at each time step all the infected individuals infect their susceptible network with probability \u03b2 and recover at a fixed time t r since they were infected. We select only the runs in which the size of the epidemic has reached a macroscopic fraction of individuals in the steady state [3, 4, 5] because the deterministic equations are only valid for epidemics above the critical threshold T c . We performed all the simulations using synchronized or simultaneous updates at each time step. In Fig. S1, we plot the time evolution of the fraction of infected nodes I(t) for ER and SF networks obtaining by the EBCM approach Eqs. (S6-S9) and the simulation. For the simulations we shifted t = 0 to the instant when the disease has reached 1% of the individuals. We choose this reference time, as the time when the disease has reached a size enough to growth deterministically. This choice compensates the time dispersion of each trial around the theoretical solution due to stochastic effects at the early stages of the process when the number of infected nodes is small [2] (see the insets of Fig. S1). As shown in Figs. S1A-B, each trial simulation has the same shape as the theoretical solution which shows that the EBCM approach and the simulations are in excellent agreement.
