In the present study, by using plaque inhibition, luciferase reporter plasmids, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA assays, we have investigated the effect and mechanism of OMT on influenza A virus (IAV) replication and IAV-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that OMT had excellent anti-IAV activity on eight IAV strains in vitro. OMT could significantly decrease the promoter activity of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes, inhibit IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB pathways, and suppress the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and MMP-2/-9. Activators of TLR4, p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways could significantly antagonize the anti-IAV activity of OMT in vitro, including IAV replication and IAV-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE). Furthermore, OMT could reduce the loss of body weight, significantly increase the survival rate of IAV-infected mice, decrease the lung index, pulmonary inflammation and lung viral titter, and improve pulmonary histopathological changes. In conclusion, OMT possesses anti-IAV and anti-inflammatory activities, the mechanism of action may be linked to its ability to inhibit IAV-induced activations of TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB pathways.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) often causes extensive respiratory infection, and severe IAV infection usually leads to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS is one of the main causes of death in intensive care units (ICU) with a high mortality rate (35% to 45%) [1, 2] . Currently, no specific medicine is available for the management of ALI/ARDS. During infection, IAV can hijack an array of intracellular signaling cascades for their own benefit, such as TLRs, RIG-I, PKC/PKR, PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways [3] . IAV infection can increase the expressions of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK4 and TRAF6, the phosphorylations of Akt, MAPK, and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In severe IAV-infected or died patients, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and MyD88 are lastingly and highly expressed [9, 10] . It has been reported that lasting activation of TLR3 is detrimental to IAV-induced acute pneumonia, conversely, IAV-infected TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice have an unexpected survival advantage with significantly lower viral titer, less inflammatory mediators, and fewer pathological changes in lung [11, 12] . TLR4 2 of 17 is reported to markedly cluster at the site of IAV-cell interaction on cytomembrane and determines IAV entry and tissue tropism through MyD88 expression and p38 MAPK activation [13] . Inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus can induce severe oxidative stress and rapidly leads to ALI through TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB signaling [14] . TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice are reported to be highly refractory to IAV-induced ALI, and TLR4 antagonist eritoran can decrease viral titer and IAV-induced lethality [15] . Activation of TLR7 is also necessary for efficient replication of IAV [16] . Several inhibitors of TLR7/8-MyD88 signaling can effectively suppress IAV replication and IAV-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) [7] . Moreover, activation of TLRs-MyD88 signals are also essential for MMP-9 release and neutrophil excessive migration, both of which are two principal causes for ALI/ARDS [17] . In addition, PI3K/Akt and the downstream cascades of TLRs, such as MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, are also required for IAV infection and proliferation [13, [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

            "text": "Based on the fact that IAV-induced over-expressions of TLRs, MyD88, TRIF, TRAF6, and abnormal nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 are essential for IAV infection, we have constructed a series of luciferase reporter plasmids based on the promoters of these genes and the nuclear response element of NF-\u03baB p65. Using these plasmids, we have performed several times of drug screening assays, and found that sophora root (Sophora flavescens Aiton), a traditional herbal medicine which has been used as an antipyretic, diuretic, and anthelmintic agent in China for thousands of years, can significantly inhibit the TLRs-MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway. Oxymatrine (C 15 H 24 N 2 O 2 , OMT) is a major active compound of sophora root [22] . It has been reported that OMT has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammation, anti-virus, hepatoprotective, and immunosuppression activities, and currently is extensively employed to treat viral hepatitis, traumatic brain injury, acute pancreatitis, sepsis, and ALI in the clinic [23] [24] [25] . In the previous study, we have found that OMT, at a low concentration, only inhibits IAV infection in vitro, but cannot in vivo. In the present study, we again determined the effect of OMT on IAV infection at a high concentration in vitro and in vivo, and investigated the mechanism of action of OMT, mainly focusing on the TLRs, PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

The cytotoxicity of OMT on MDCK was similar with that on A549 cells ( Figure S1 ). Then through a plaque inhibition assay, we found that OMT could significantly inhibit IAV (ST169, H1N1) replication at the range of 50-400 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 1B,C) , y = 0.273ln(x) + 7.0201, R 2 = 0.958, EC 50 = 17.059 \u00b5g/mL, AI (CC 50 /EC 50 ) = 3868.1359, and we chose 50 \u00b5g/mL as the test concentration for the following pharmacological experiments.",

The EC 50 was 23.67, 7.77, 9.32, 8.86, 22.23, 10 .71 and 5.91 \u00b5g/mL, respectively ( Figure 2A) . Moreover, OMT also could significantly inhibit ST169 (H1N1) infection at different multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1) ( Figure 2B ). Finally, to detect the effect of OMT on virus life cycle, i.e., which steps of IAV replication were inhibited, we further performed a time-of-addition assay, and found that OMT could not directly inactivate IAV and had no significant influence on cells before IAV infection and on IAV adsorption. The inhibition of OMT on IAV replication only occurred during 1-5 h post infection (p.i.) ( Figure S2 ). The cytotoxicity of OMT was determined by a MTT method on A549 cells. Data shown were mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3, * p < 0.05, compared with the 0 \u03bcg/mL group; (B, C) The effect of OMT on IAV replication was determined by a plaque inhibition assay. In the negative control (NC), MDCK cells were infected with IAV (ST169) but not treated with any drugs; in the positive control (PC) and OMT-treated groups, MDCK cells were infected with IAV (ST169) and treated with ribavirin (25 \u03bcg/mL) and OMT (400, 200, 100 and 50 \u03bcg/mL, respectively), MOI = 0.001, the incubation time was 48 h.

Oseltamivir and OMT could significantly increase the survival rate of mice infected with IAV (PR8) ( Figure 7B ). In addition, OMT and oseltamivir could significantly reduce the lung index and the transcriptions of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 7C,D) , and significantly reduce the pulmonary viral load, determined at day 6 p.i.

Pleschka S. et al. have showed that activation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is a prerequisite for IAV replication, and blockade of ERK pathway can retard RNP export and reduces virus titers [19] . Marjuki H. et al. have showed that IAV-induced activations of ERK and PI3K are required for the fusion of IAV viral particles with the target cells mediated by V-ATPase-dependent intracellular pH change [35] . Guo B. et al. have showed that p38 MAPK is a key determinant of virus entry and tissue tropism [13] . Activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is also a prerequisite for IAV infection, NF-\u03baB inhibitors can specifically diminish IAV vRNA transcription from its cRNA promoter and reduce vRNA synthesis [21] . Our results have shown that OMT can significantly decrease IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB pathways, which may imply that these signal pathways may also be implicated in the anti-IAV activity of OMT.",

So we think that OMT-inhibition on IAV replication may be through inhibiting TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. As aforementioned, these pathways have been proved to be essential for IAV replication [13] [14] [15] 21] .",

OMT is a well-known strong immunosuppressive agent [25] , so we have further determined the effect of OMT on the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, and find that OMT can significantly suppress IAV-induced releases of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plate. 0.09 mL of virus suspension (50 \u00d7 TCID 50 ) and 0.01 mL medium containing the test drug were added.

Three wells were used each for the negative (virus-infected non-drug-treated) and mock controls (non-infected non-drug-treated). 0.5% DMSO was used in each group.
