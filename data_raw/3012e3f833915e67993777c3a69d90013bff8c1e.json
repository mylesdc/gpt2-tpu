Here, we identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but also reduce the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a promising target for hostdirected antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.",

It requires a fine-tuned sequence of molecular actions largely executed by autophagy-related genes (ATGs). In the initial steps, a phagophore consisting of a double-membrane sheet is nucleated, amplified and finally closed to form a vesicular structure called an autophagosome that engulfs cellular material for degradation 1 . Degradation is accomplished after the fusion of autophagosomes (AP) with lysosomes to form autolysosomes (AL).",

In general, FKBP51 is a stress-regulated protein involved in numerous pathways, likely through scaffolding regulatory protein interactions 3 . FKBP51-induced autophagy is accompanied by elevated levels of Beclin1 (BECN1) through a yet unknown mechanism. This multifunctional protein is crucial in autophagy and membrane trafficking processes 4 . In mammals, BECN1 is an essential component of two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complexes through its interaction with either Barkor (BECN1-associated autophagy-related key regulator)/ATG14 or UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene) 5 . The ATG14-complex is important for the initial nucleation steps of autophagy, whereas the UVRAG containing complex functions in endocytic trafficking and autophagosomal maturation. ATG14 is also found on mature autophagosomes where it enhances tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes 6 .",

            "text": "The regulation of BECN1 through post-translational modification is well documented, and in particular involves phosphorylation and ubiquitination 4 . The oncogenic kinase AKT1 phosphorylates BECN1 at positions S234, S295, which leads to sequestration of this peripheral membrane binding protein 7 to the cytoskeleton with the result of inhibition of autophagy 8 . Several other autophagy-regulating kinases (both stimulatory and inhibitory) also target BECN1 4 . Furthermore, distinct E3 ligases of different types modify BECN1 with K11-, K48-or K63-linked poly-ubiquitins 9 , complemented by ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) 10, 11 . Depending on the site and type of linkage of BECN1 ubiquitination, autophagy is inhibited or enhanced; the underlying mechanisms involve degradation of BECN1 and modulation of its protein interactions 9,12 . Studies investigating the interplay between autophagy and viruses revealed that some viruses use parts of the autophagy machinery for their own replication but also have evolved strategies to escape autophagic degradation. Congruently, autophagyinducing agents can have antiviral effects 13 . In case of coronaviruses (CoV), the formation of replication complexes at double membrane vesicles (DMV) and, most likely, of infectious particles depend on ER-derived membranes, as does autophagy [14] [15] [16] . Thus, current knowledge suggests that CoV interact differentially with components of the autophagic pathway with the potential for both the utilization of autophagy components for virus replication and for the attenuation of autophagy 17 . Substances inhibiting the generation of DMVs have been shown to be broadly reactive against CoV replication in vitro 18 . Importantly, this included CoV of different genera including the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, a paradigmatic emerging virus that entails considerable pandemic risks due to its prevalence in dromedary populations in Africa and the Arabian Pensinsula and its transmission via the respiratory tract causing a severe form of pneumonia in humans [18] [19] [20] [21] . Since its discovery in 2012, the WHO has reported 2468 human MERS-CoV infections in 27 countries, of which at least 851 were fatal (http://www.who. int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/).",

Regulation of BECN1 protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome system was indicated by using the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which increased the levels of BECN1 and the extent of its ubiquitination (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The use of ammonium chloride to inhibit lysosome-mediated proteolysis confirmed proteasomal degradation of BECN1 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) .

Ubiquitination frequently forms chains linking several ubiquitin units to distinct lysine (K) residues. The type of lysine linkage determines protein fate and function 39 . Using a set of ubiquitin mutants, we found that SKP2 leads to K48-linked poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 3a) , which marks proteins for proteasomal degradation 39 . Using a freely available mass-spectrometry database that proposes ubiquitination sites in mammalian proteins 40 , we mutated various lysines in BECN1 and identified K402 in BECN1\u2032s ECD (evolutionary conserved domain) as the attachment site of SKP2-directed ubiquitination (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 1e ). The potential recruitment of SKP2 by FKBP51 raises the question how this may lead to reduced rather than increased ubiquitination of BECN1. Since FKBP51 inactivates the kinase AKT1 through complex formation with the phosphatase PHLPP 2,31 , and AKT1 regulates SKP2 through phosphorylation at S72 41 , we used ectopic expression of FKBP51-Flag and co-immunoprecipitation to probe for protein interactions and the phosphorylation status of SKP2.

The pulse-chase assay confirmed SMIP004 as the most efficient compound in stabilising BECN1 leaving threefold more BECN1 protein after 90 min (Fig. 5b) . Furthermore, SMIP004 reduced ubiquitination of BECN1 most efficiently (Fig. 5c , last lane). The long-lived protein assay revealed that SMER3 and SMIP004 enhanced protein half-life, while C1 showed no effect (Fig. 5d ). Starvation by cultivating the cells in HBSS, which we confirmed to induce autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 2b -d), did not elicit a greater effect than SMIP004 in the long-lived protein assay (Fig. 5d) . Furthermore, SMIP004 most profoundly affected not only BECN1, but also LC3B-II/I and P62 (example blot in Fig. 5e , quantifications in Supplementary Fig. 2e -g) that are established markers of autophagy. To analyse autophagy more thoroughly, it is mandatory to include assays that address autophagic protein turn-over, commonly referred to as autophagic flux 43 . Thus, we subjected SMIP004 to a flux assay with the specific inhibitor of vacuolar H + -ATPases bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which interferes with lysosome acidification and thus degradation of autophagosome cargo 43 . We revealed a stimulatory effect of SMIP004 on the autophagic flux ( Fig. 5f , Supplementary Fig. 2b , c). In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosome-lysosome fusion 6 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 ( Supplementary  Fig. 2h , i). Thus, SMIP004 was used as SKP2-inhibitor (SKP2i) in all subsequent experiments.",

A fusion block was also evidenced by the significantly reduced ATG14 oligomerization, essential for AP-lysosome fusion 6 , in infected cells (Fig. 6e , f) and by the increase of the autophagy target P62 ( Supplementary  Fig. 3c ). The block of vesicle fusion was further tested by the use of BafA1: as expected, LC3B-II/I levels were not further enhanced upon treatment with BafA1 (Fig. 6g) . The fusion between AP and lysosome membranes is facilitated by the interaction between tSNARE proteins STX17 (AP-bound) and VAMP8 (lysosomebound). This interaction is mediated by SNAP29 47 (Supplementary Fig. 3d ). Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that MERS-CoV infection leads to a reduced interaction of STX17 with SNAP29 and VAMP8 (Fig. 6h ). This further supports the conclusion that MERS-CoV infection causes a block of AP-lysosome fusion.",

CoV-induced DMV formation is known to depend on viral nonstructural proteins (NSP) 4 and 6 18, 48, 49 . Ectopic expression of MERS-CoV NSP4 and 6 indeed led to an accumulation of LC3B-II/I and of P62 in the case of NSP6, while NSP4 only had a very minor effect on LC3B-II/I (Fig. 7c ).

To assess potential autophagy-related functions, we overexpressed all MERS-CoV accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5.

Because p4b and p5 are accessory proteins that can be deleted without lethal effects on virus replication, we constructed recombinant MERS-CoVs lacking the respective orfs ( Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) to evaluate their effect on autophagy in the context of full virus replication. In comparison to the recombinant MERS-CoV the p4b-and p5-deletion variants showed a decreased accumulation of P62 and LC3B-II/I, suggesting that both proteins contribute to the inhibition of the autophagic flux ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) .

The influence of MERS-CoV infection on SKP2 phosphorylation, BECN1 degradation and its inhibition of the autophagic flux encouraged us to test if SKP2 inhibitors (such as SKP2i) may limit MERS-CoV amplification in infected cells. Indeed, SKP2i caused significant reduction of viral replication (by about 250-fold, Fig. 8a, Supplementary Fig. 5a) . To explore the relevance of SKP2 inhibition on viral infection in more general terms, we also tested SKP2i in Sindbis virus (SINV) replication. It is known that SINV induces autophagy but that its replication levels are unaffected by it 52 . We observed that treatment with SKP2i caused a moderate decrease of SINV replication ( Supplementary Fig. 5b, c) . SKP2i may thus be exploitable as a broader therapeutic antiviral principle.",

If this is correct, other ways of enhancing BECN1\u2032s effect on autophagy should elicit similar effects. Therefore, we used two recently introduced tools to enhance BECN1 function in autophagy: the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and a BECN1-derived peptide 53, 54 . These compounds, in contrast to SKP2i, do not change the levels of BECN1, but increase autophagy by redirecting BECN1 function towards the autophagy pathway, which we confirmed in VeroB4 cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 7b-d, g) . Enhanced autophagy was indicated by the increase of LC3B-II/I ( Supplementary Fig. 7e, g) and the reduction of P62 ( Supplementary Fig. 7f, g) . This was paralleled by inhibition of MERS-CoV replication by up to 60-fold in the case of the BECN1peptide (TAT-B) ( Figure Supplementary Fig. 7h ) and up to 10-fold in the case of ABT-737 at 48h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 7i) . These results are in accordance with the notion that increasing BECN1 Fig. 5 SKP2 inhibitors enhance BECN1 protein stability and autophagy. a, b Evaluation of small compounds inhibiting SKP2. HEK293 cells were exposed to known SKP2 inhibitors for 24 h, followed by additional exposure to cycloheximide (CHX, 30 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) for the times as indicated or vehicle (a). b HEK293 cells were transfected with Halo-tagged BECN1 expressing plasmid and exposed to known SKP2 inhibitors and halogenated dye (100 nM, R110Direct) overnight. Cells were transferred to medium without dye and harvested after the indicated times. Labelled BECN1 was determined and quantified. c HEK293 cells were transfected with control vector (\u2212) or plasmids expressing BECN1-Flag, HA-ubiquitin and myc-SKP2. Cells were exposed to known SKP2 inhibitors (C1, 3 \u00b5M; SMER3, 5 \u00b5M; SMIP004, 10 \u00b5M) for 24 h, BECN1 was precipitated from cell extracts and its ubiquitination and levels were determined by western blotting. d SKP2 inhibitors impact long-lived proteins. HEK293 cells were metabolically labelled with [ 14 C]-valine overnight, exposed to the indicated drugs or starvation (HBSS = Hank's balanced salt solution) and the degradation of proteins was determined 4 h after withdrawal of [ 14 C]-valine completed media.

VeroB4 cells were exposed to the indicated drugs or vehicle and the levels of P62 and LC3B-II/I were determined by western blotting (e).

While BafA1 did not change LC3B lipidation in infected cells as evidenced by constant levels of LC3B-II/I in the absence of SKP2i (as before, Fig. 6g gray bars) , it increased LC3B-II/I in the presence of SKP2i (Supplementary Fig. 7j) . The fluorescence-based assay revealed that SKP2i enhanced the number of AP while decreasing the number of AL (Fig. 8b, c) . Furthermore, SKP2i enhanced ATG14 oligomerization (Fig. 8d, e) and the interaction of autophagic SNARE complex proteins (STX17 with VAMP8 or SNAP29), in MERS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 8f) , thereby counteracting the effect of MERS-CoV (see above, Fig. 6h) . Thus, SKP2i inhibits MERS-CoV production, most likely by enhancing BECN1 levels, which might also account for its effect on late steps of autophagy 55 . Since very little interaction between BECN1 and STX17 was detected using immunoprecipitation, this effect of BECN1 may require interaction with ATG14 6 .",

This action of SKP2 is counteracted by FKBP51 that regulates SKP2 phosphorylation through forming regulatory complexes with AKT1 and PHLPP. Inhibition of SKP2 increases BECN1 levels, enhances the assembly of lysosomal SNARE proteins and autophagy, and efficiently reduces the replication of MERS-CoV (Fig. 9d ). FKBP51 is a pivotal element of molecular feedback loops of the cellular and physiological stress reaction. It increasingly emerges as a scaffolder that chaperones various regulatory protein interactions 3 . Here, FKBP51 appears to recruit SKP2 in its inactive form to BECN1, probably by virtue of its interaction with the kinase AKT1 and the phosphatase PHLPP. Similarly, FKBP51directed protein interactions increase BECN1 phosphorylation 2 , decrease phosphorylation and activity of AKT1 31 . Thus, FKBP51 impacts BECN1 at least via two mechanisms, phosphorylation of BECN1 itself 2 and of its regulatory E3 ligase SKP2. Both mechanisms involve AKT1, which exhibits yet another way of influencing BECN1 by phosphorylating USP14, which removes K63-linked ubiquitins from BECN1 57 .",

The present study as well as earlier work suggest autophagy as a pivotal component of virus-host interaction and potential broad-range antiviral target 13, 52 . For MERS-CoV replication, it remains to be elucidated whether blocking basal autophagy is mandatory or only auxiliary; nevertheless, the virus encodes at least three proteins that limit autophagy when expressed ectopically, NSP6, p4b and p5. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms are yet to be analysed, MERS-CoV NSP6 may also play a role in inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as Table 3 ) and cotreatment with Bafilomycin A1 (0.1 \u03bcM) was performed to evaluate the autophagic flux.

The effect of SKP2 can be diminished in two ways, either by chemical inhibition or by FKBP51, which scaffolds protein interactions ultimately leading to SKP2 inactivation through inhibiting its phosphorylation. Both scenarios enhance autophagy, which involves ATG14 oligomerization (probably 7-8mers) as recently described essential step in functional autophagy 6 .

The absence of p4b and p5 during MERS-CoV replication may also result in lower LC3B levels compared to MERS-CoV wildtype-infected but also to the mock-infected control cells. This points to a more complex interaction between virus replication and autophagy; p4b and p5 may counteract a response of the host to viral infection, but the functional relevance of their link to autophagy requires further investigation. Apparently, several CoV proteins collaborate to reprogram the membrane traffic in the cell for DMV formation serving as compartments of viral genome replication and transcription 18, 24 .

We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.
