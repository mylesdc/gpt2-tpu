The PRRS epidemic situation in China has been very complicated since the unprecedented largescale highly pathogenic PRRS (HP-PRRS) outbreaks in 2006. And now the HP-PRRS virus (HP-PRRSV) and classical North American type PRRSV strains have coexisted in China. Rapid differential detection of the two strains of PRRSV is very important for effective PRRS control. The real-time RT-PCR for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV by using both SYBR Green and TaqMan probes was developed and validated. Both assays can be used for rapid detection and strainspecific identification of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. However, the TaqMan probe method had the highest detection rate whereas the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest. The real-time RT-PCR developed based on SYBR Green and TaqMan probe could be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV in China, which will benefit much the PRRS control and research.",

In 2006 there was an unparalleled large-scale outbreak of the so-called high fever disease in most provinces of China that affected more than 2,000,000 pigs, leading to concerns within the global swine industry and in relation to public health [2] [3] [4] . In March 2007 the disease was identified in the Hai Duong province of Vietnam and it spread countrywide affecting more than 65,000 pigs [5, 6] . The outbreaks caused extensive concern worldwide [7] . Studies demonstrated that highly virulent porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) was the major causative pathogen of the socalled high fever disease [2] . Genetic analysis indicated that the HP-PRRSVs isolated from China and Vietnam shared a discontinuous deletion of 30 aa in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2), as compared with the North American type PRRSV strains (NA PRRSV) [2, 5, 8] . Since 2006, the HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV strains coexist in China. Now PRRS epidemic situation is very complicated in China, of which the predominant form is the HP-PRRSV. Rapid differential detection of the two strains of PRRSV is very important for effective PRRS control. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an assay for simultaneous detection and strain identification of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV.",

The development of real-time RT-PCR technology offers the opportunity for more rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of virus. The current two major genotypes, the European (EU) and the North American (US) strains, have been rapidly identified by SYBR Green-based or TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay [9] [10] [11] . A specific TaqMan probe realtime RT-PCR has been developed for assaying the HP-PRRSV 2 Journal of Immunology Research [12] , but it is not able to differentially detect the HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. In this research, the real-time RT-PCR for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV by using both SYBR Green and TaqMan probe was developed and validated. These two methods provided alternative diagnostic assays in diverse PRRSV epidemiological circumstances.",

Fluorescent signal was detected for each cycle at the end of the 60 \u2218 C extension step.

The results showed that real-time PCR using both SYBR Green I ( Figure 6 ) and TaqMan probe ( Figure 5 ) can be used to detect concentrations at least 10 0 copies/ L of plasmid standards whereas the sensitivity of conventional PCR was only 10 3 copies/ L.",

But the TaqMan probe method had the highest detection rate, whereas the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest. The SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay is timesaving, easy to handle, and highly sensitive. Yang et al. detected the PRRSV and CSFV RNA by SYBR Green I-based quantitative PCR and found that both sensitivity and specificity were equal or superior to conventional RT-PCR [14] . Although Tian et al. developed a rapid SYBR one step real-time RT-PCR for detection of PRRSV [15] , it could not be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV (PRRSV). Kleiboeker et al. developed dual labeled probes quantitative PCR, which could simultaneously detect NA-and EU-PRRSV [16] . However, this assay could not simultaneously detect and differentiate between both HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV (PRRSV) strains in China. The TaqMan probe method provided more accurate results than SYBR Green I with melting curve analysis. SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay was simpler, rapider, and lower in cost than TaqMan probe method. In addition to the high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, the realtime PCR assay based on both SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe established by us could recognize coinfection of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. Because the two types of PRRSV isolates coexist in Chinese swine herds, recombination could occur. Therefore, the results provided alternative diagnostic assays in diverse PRRSV epidemiological circumstances.",
