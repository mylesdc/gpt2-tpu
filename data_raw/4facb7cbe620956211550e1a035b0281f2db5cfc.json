Stakeholders are less aware of and less frequently use rapid sources such as HealthMap and rely more on validated but less timely traditional sources of disease surveillance. Users identified a need for more timely and reliable epidemic intelligence. E merging and re-emerging diseases are significant threats to global health security. The Asia-Pacific region has been the global epicentre for many emerging infectious diseases, including some with pandemic potential. 1 The emergence of new diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, the threat of diseases external to the region such as Ebola, and recurring outbreaks of endemic diseases highlight the ongoing threat that infectious diseases pose to national, regional and international health security. 1-4 The Asia-Pacific region encompasses two World Health Organization (WHO) regions: South-East Asia and the Western Pacific, home to 3.4 billion people, or over 53% of the world's population. 5 The region is one of the most diverse areas in the world in terms of socioeconomic development, geography and geopolitical influence. 5 It is also particularly vulnerable to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to several factors including increased population growth and movement, urbanization, globalization, limited access to health care, changes in food trade, land degradation and encroachment on natural habitats and antimicrobial resistance. 1,6,7 This rapidly changing landscape, along with weak health systems, limited health infrastructure, resource constraints (financial, human, technical), geographical isolation and poor population health, challenge countries' abilities to adequately prevent, detect and respond to public health threats. [8] [9] [10] [11] The ability to rapidly detect and respond to infectious diseases is critical to global health security. The International Health Regulations, or IHR (2005), provide the legal framework to protect the international community from these threats, requiring Member States to develop core capacities to detect, assess, notify and respond to public health threats and events of national and international concern. 12 WPSAR ",

There are limited studies on the epidemic intelligence needs of end-users. A review of evaluations of 11 global electronic event-based biosurveillance systems found that evaluations focused on the quantitative analysis of system performance. 16 The authors recommended that future evaluations assess the usefulness of systems for public health action for end-users. Stakeholder engagement in all stages of surveillance system development from planning to implementation is important to create a successful and useful system that meets end-users' needs. 16, 21 As part of the development of a new epidemic observatory, Epi-watch, we sought to understand the global outbreak surveillance needs of stakeholders Hii et al Epidemic intelligence needs considered part of a single language group, the Malay language) were also grouped together.",

Twelve per cent (11/91) reported other reasons, such as a delay in or no reporting of events at the country level and lack of local relevance. Nine per cent (8/91) reported no limitations in their sources. Multiple responses were allowed for this question. * Total number of responses for each global outbreak news source was used as the denominator to calculate percentages for timeliness and sufficiency for each source separately, as not all respondents used all sources. \u2020 Categories were not mutually exclusive as respondents could select more than one when selecting global outbreak news sources. \u2021 One respondent who used these sources reported that timeliness and sufficiency were not relevant to their needs. Hii et al Epidemic intelligence needs Outbreaks 23 and the CDC's Current Outbreak List 37 were more commonly used by respondents over other services such as HealthMap 33 but are less timely. Previous studies have documented significant delays in official reporting of outbreaks compared to unofficial reports. 38, 39 Research has identified that the majority of event-based Internet surveillance systems are generated from North America and Europe; few local systems in the Asia-Pacific region and event-based surveillance systems in general are not well understood in developed and developing countries. 32,36 Increased awareness of the availability and operability of systems providing timely, relevant and reliable information to professionals in the region could address some of these concerns.",

WHO Outbreaks 23 and ProMED-mail 24 were the most commonly accessed sources by many respondents.

            "text": "This study had several limitations. Due to the crosssectional online survey design, we were unable to monitor trends in responses/behaviour over time, and findings may not be representative because of the snapshot nature of the timing of the survey and possible non-response bias. As we were interested in stakeholder views at a point in time, this design was appropriate. The online nature of the survey meant that questions could not be explored in-depth; however, a free text option was provided for most questions. Limited access to the Internet and computers in remote and resource-constrained areas could have affected the response rate. Compared to positing surveys, this was the most feasible option, and with some of the most remote PICTs participating, we do not believe access was a major barrier. The study with the key attributes of successful event-based surveillance systems: to be simple, flexible, timely and sensitive. 15 With automated alerts being the predominant information-seeking strategy employed by respondents, Internet-based services that provide this function can support the rapid and timely identification of events to limit the spread and severity of disease outbreaks. 31 A limitation of event-based surveillance systems is that new information is not necessarily disseminated efficiently. 32 While HealthMap 33 is a rapid intelligence source, it was only used by 10% of participants, possibly reflecting low awareness of this resource. Consumers preferred global outbreak alert systems be flexible in the way information is accessed and disseminated. Email was identified by respondents as the preferred communication method to receive global outbreak news; however, these needs may change depending on the context of the outbreak and over time (reflecting generational change in the use of communication technology); systems should consider a range of media such as SMS and social media. Communication technologies such as social media can be harnessed for rapid access and dissemination of information to support emergency preparedness and response. 34 The use of mainstream media and specialist Internet sources for global outbreak news is not surprising given the increased accessibility and reliance on the Internet for information and acceptability of event-based Internet surveillance systems. Approximately 65% of initial reports to WHO about infectious disease events come from informal sources such as the Internet. 35 A 2017 systematic review of event-based Internet biosurveillance systems identified 50 systems, 37 of which were online and fully functioning at the time. 36 Many of these systems use mainstream media as a key source of information. 17, 36 The finding that the same proportion of respondents used both mainstream media and specialist Internet sources for global outbreak news suggests that Internet-based services are not meeting end-users' needs, and other media sources are required to supplement information leading to duplication of effort.",

While this approach ensured participation of professionals from a wide range of backgrounds and levels who use epidemic intelligence, it can create researcher bias because of the judgmental nature of sample selection. Epidemic response is a small and specialized field, so the sample frame from which we could draw was small, making purposive sampling the most appropriate. Limited inclusion of other large Asian countries, differences in participant selection across countries and low numbers of respondents meant that results could not be compared between countries and may not be generalizable to other countries or representative of the whole Asia-Pacific region. Finally, survey versions in languages other than English were not back-translated, which may have affected the quality of these responses. As 11% (n = 10) of respondents completed the survey in a language other than English, translation inaccuracies are unlikely to have any impact on the overall validity of the survey. Further research on language-specific needs for epidemic surveillance is warranted.",
