Anticipated difficulties in patient recruitment, study design, and ethical concerns affect the feasibility of conducting randomized clinical trials that examine the efficacy of ECMO in this population.

An ECMO team was created that was available 24 h a day/7 days a week. The team included an intensivist trained in ECMO, a cardiac surgeon, a perfusionist, and ECMO-trained nurses. The intensivist on the ECMO team triaged all calls from other centers based on predefined criteria, wherein patients were predetermined to be candidates to receive ECMO or not.

The control group were patients who met the above criteria but did not receive ECMO in the period prior to the introduction of ECMO program (prior to April 2014). Weaning from ECMO was primarily based on clinical improvement demonstrated by adequate oxygenation and gas exchange shown in vital signs, blood gases, and chest X-ray. The decision for readiness of a patient to be weaned from ECMO was left to the judgment of treating clinician and the ECMO team. The weaning process followed the ELSO criteria as follow: weaning starts by decreasing the flow to 1L/min while keeping the sweep of 100% (to maintain SPO2 > 95%). If SPO2 remains within target, a trial of clamping the catheters and keeping the patient on the ventilator at appropriate settings was attempted.",

There was a large variation in survival rates, which could be explained by differences in patients' baseline characteristics and severity of illness. In one study, older, obese, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients were found to be at a higher risk of developing severe [28] [29] [30] [31] . In this study, the two groups were comparable at baseline, and there were no significant differences between groups in any of these variables. Another large observational study examined the predictors of death in H1N1 patients who underwent V-V ECMO and found that creatinine and bilirubin levels, systemic arterial pressure, hematocrit, and pre-ECMO hospital length of stay were associated with higher mortality [32] . Another important factor is the center experience and volume of cases; this could have contributed to the variability in survival rates with ECMO use. A recent study by Barbaro et al. [33] demonstrated that centers with > 30 ECMO cases/year had better survival rates than centers with less than 6 cases per year. In Saudi Arabia, ECMO was not available except in one center until the MERS-CoV crisis; thereafter, the ECMO program was implemented as a therapeutic option for patients with refractory hypoxemia. ECMO interventions were run in tertiary centers with equipped ICUs by most experienced intensivists and perfusionists who received training in ECMO prior to the start of the program.",

All patients in the control group died, which may be explained by the severity of illness, as these were patients who had ARDS and were eligible otherwise. We cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias, as we were unable to track all transfer requests due to the outbreak and crisis at the time, leaving us with limited information. In addition, some patients were transferred from non-participating ECMO centers; therefore, baseline pre-ECMO data such as blood gases and ventilator settings could not be obtained. Furthermore, due to insufficient documentation during the outbreak and crisis circumstances, we were not able to track the ECMO requests to the referral call center.",

Such concerns can only be addressed in RCTs; however, conducting RCT is likely to be challenging in the context of epidemics. This study was not designed to compare the cost of 2 interventions; although it is an important outcome that could help the clinicians and stakeholders to make decisions. Lastly, the small sample size limited our ability to perform an adequate multivariate analysis. Similar to other ECMO studies, it is difficult to determine if the mortality was the result of refractory respiratory failure or other causes like septic shock or other organs failure.",
