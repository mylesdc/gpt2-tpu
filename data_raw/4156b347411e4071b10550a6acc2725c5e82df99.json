            "text": "As a consequence of innate immune activation granulocytes and macrophages produce hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via secretion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) to the outside of the cells, where HOCl immediately reacts with proteins. Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.",

Neither Idea-PP nor the control PP was toxic for the human cells in the used concentrations of up to 50 mg/ml since the mitochondrial activity was not decreased. ( Fig. 2A, B) The first assay to test the effect of Idea-PP on binding to and fusion with human cells was based on an adherent CD4+ HeLa cell line stably transfected with episomal vectors carrying the bgalactosidase gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. HIV-1 infection of these cells transactivates the LTR promoter inducing b-galactosidase production. Infected cells stained dark blue after the addition of the chromogenic substrate X-Gal. All tested Idea-PP pools reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2D , E, F), whereas the non-modified original material had no effect (Fig. 2C ). However the antiviral effect was more prominent when Idea-PP was produced with a molar ratio of protein to HOCl of 1:1000 ( Fig. 2E : IC90 0.5 mg/ml, IC50 3.5 mg/ml) compared to the material generated with a ratio 1:300 ( Fig. 2D : IC90 7 mg/ml, IC50 31 mg/ml). A higher ratio of 1:2000 did not further increase the virus-inhibitory effect of Idea-PP ( Fig. 2F : IC90 0.5 mg/ml, IC50 3.5 mg/ml).",

Infected host cells fuse together induced by CD4-gp120 interaction on the plasma membrane to form large to giant cells with several nuclei. Inhibition of syncytia formation by Idea-PP was seen using M8166 cells, while pooled plasma protein control had no effect ( Pooled plasma protein control had in addition no influence on the formation of HIV-1-induced HeLaT4-lacZ syncytia (Fig. 3A) . HIV-1 particles pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of PP induced not less syncytia as those treated with medium only. In contrast, the number of syncytia decreased, when the viral particles were incubated with Idea-PP generated with different molar ratios of protein:HOCl (Fig. 3C , E, G). As seen in the previous experiment where the number of infected host cells was quantified, Idea-PP prepared with a ratio of 1:1000 (protein:-HOCl) was more effective to interfere with syncytia formation than Idea-PP prepared with a ratio of 1:300 ( Binding of either plasma proteins (PP) or altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) to purified HIV-1 gp120 (A), CD4 (B) or PDI (C), respectively was determined by specific ELISA.

Oxidation by myeloperoxidase-derived HOCl can cause both a loss of function of protease inhibitors and lysozyme [24] , but also a gain of function has been reported [25] . Most proteins that become altered by the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system do not belong to the invading microorganisms, but to the host [20] . We speculated, that HOCl-altered host proteins might have a role in host defence. Therefore plasma proteins were modified by the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system. The altered protein mixture still bound to immobilized GSH after very carefully removal of HOCl. As HIV-1-gp120 [26] , host cell CD4 [27] , and the PDI [28] all present ecto-sulfhydryls essential for HIV-1 entry, it was examined whether Idea-PP is able to bind to these proteins. Using ELISA and plasmon resonance technique specific and high affinity binding of Idea-PP to gp120, CD4 as well as to the PDI was observed.",

Treatment of plasma protein with the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system was shown to lead to the conversion of L-threonine into 2-hydroxypropanal and its dehydration product, acrolein (2-propenal), an extremely reactive a, b-unsaturated aldehyde [44] . Aldehyde production was also mimicked by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the absence of the Idea-HSA (F) and added to the cells; the cells were visualized after 4d. The dualtropic HIV-1-strain 93BR020 was pre-incubated with either HSA (G) or with IDEA-HSA 1:1000 (H). Numbers of infected cells after 4d are presented as mean 6 SD from four parallel samples. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066073.g005 enzyme. In a murine model of acute myocardial infarction, the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system was found to be a major source of acrolein [45] . The a,b-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein can form bisadducts with lysine residues, which are called FDP-lysines [46] . The electrophilic a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is retained in FDPlysine, allowing it to undergo a nucleophilic addition of thiols [47] . Protein-conjugated FDP-lysine was detected by the FDP-lysine specific antibody F56 [46] . Using antibody F56 we documented that Idea-HSA, but not the unmodified mother protein HSA, contained FDP-lysine residues. As Idea-Ps binding to gp120, CD4 and PDI is inhibited by DTNB and Idea-Ps clearly contain accessible chemical groups that react eagerly with free SH groups, it is likely that SHgroups are at least in part involved in the interaction between Idea-Ps and HIV-1. FDP-lysine groups have been shown to bind covalently to free SH groups of the protein glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase [47] . Probably FDP-lysine groups in Idea-Ps will also link Idea-Ps to its targets on HIV-1 in a covalent manner. The very slow off rates seen in the sensorgrams of the plasmon resonance data support this interpretation.",

            "text": "Other microorganisms depend on an amyloid coat to attach to host cells [51] and on active thiols for entry into the host cell as well. The coxsackievirus A9 and dengue fever virus serotype 2 use the amyloid recognizing chaperone BiP as a co-receptor for virus internalization [52, 53] . Ryser et al described that HIV-1 entry into host cells can be inhibited by bacitracin [28] . Bacitracin is usually considered to be a specific inhibitor of PDI activity. Recently, however, bacitracin has been shown to have in addition significant effects on both no catalyzed protein folding and on other molecular chaperones. Especially bacitracin significantly inhibits the chaperone activity of BiP, the general binding protein for amyloid-like proteins [54] . As Idea-proteins bind to BiP and the known HIV-1 Figure 7 . Binding of HIV-1-gp120, CD4 and PDI to HOCl-altered HSA (Idea-HSA) in the presence of cell impermeable thiol blocker DTNB and detection of FDP-lysine on Idea-HSA. The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 (A), CD4 (B) and PDI (C) were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of the thiol reagent DTNB. Binding of Idea-HSA (1 mg/ml) was quantified by a specific ELISA. The extinction is given as mean 6 SD from three parallel samples. Idea-HSA (D) and HSA were immobilized and the binding of the FDP-lysine specific monoclonal antibody (clone 5F6) was tested by ELISA. The extinction is given as mean 6 SD from three parallel samples. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066073.g007 entry inhibitor bacitracin inhibits BiP, it is likely that in addition to the chaperone PDI, the chaperone GRP78/BiP, a principal sensor for amyloidogenic proteins, is involved in HIV-1-infection. Involvement of cell surface BiP would also explain the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI). As other viruses have been shown to use BiP for internalisation [55, 56] Idea-proteins might also be useful as inhibitors of other virus infections. Jain et al observed that blocking the production of free thiols by thiol-disulfide exchange inhibitors of the fusion protein (F) of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) the F protein inhibited membrane fusion required for viral entry and cellcell fusion [57] . The role of thiol-disulfide exchange in host cell entry/invasion is not restricted to viruses. According to Conant et al Chlamydia attachment to mammalian cells requires protein disulfide isomerase [58] , and disulfide oxidoreductase activity of Shigella flexneri is required for invasion of epithelial cells [59] . The protein disulfide isomerase of the parasite Neospora canium is involved in tachyzoite-host cell interaction [60] .The PDI was even identified to play an important role in cancer cell (glioma) invasion [61] . Therefore our newly discovered neutrophil function might be of general relevance to path physiology.",

We postulate that the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system, in addition to its other roles in host defence, works as a mechanism to form HIV-1 inhibitors by forming amyloid-like proteins that immobilizes the virus and by the generation of FDP-lysine residues on these proteins that attack ecto-sulfhydryls in gp120, CD4 and in the PDI. Idea-proteins have an amyloid-like structure and bind with high affinity to proteins and regents offering free thiol groups. As these amyloid-like proteins bind to HIV-1, oligomerize, and built aggregates and nets, they will probably immobilize the virus and interfere with its binding to the cell surface chaperone GRP78/BiP. High affinity binding was shown to gp120, CD4 as well as to PDI. Thiol-blocker DTNB inhibited the binding of Idea-P to gp120, CD4 and PDI showing that the binding was SH-dependent. Other proteins involved in HIV-1 entry that offer free SH-groups are thioredoxin, a 12-kD redox protein, necessary for disulfide exchange in domain 2 of CD4, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), essential for reduction of gp120 disulfide bonds, which triggers the major conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 required for virus entry. We hypothesize that Idea-P can inhibit on several levels HIV-1 entry by immobilization and by blocking free thiols. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066073.g008 by WHO from a brazilean patient in 1993 [65] and propagated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from healthy human blood donors.

Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) was from Takara (Otsu, Japan). Binding of the different Idea-Ps to gp120 IIIB, CD4 as well as to the PDI were demonstrated in a standard ELISA. In brief, the bottom of the wells of NUNC MaxiSorp TM polystyrene 96 well ELISA plates were coated with gp120, CD4 or PDI, respectively (100 ng/well in 100 ml coating buffer) over night at 4uC. The selected coating and blocking buffers were 15 mM disodium carbonate and 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and 0.25% gelatine solution with phosphate-buffered saline solution +0.05% Tween20 (PBS-T), respectively. The wells were blocked for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed 4 times with 300 ml washing buffer (PBS-T) per well and all residual washing buffer was removed. 100 ml Idea-P samples or unaltered mother proteins were added to appropriate wells and incubated at 37uC for 1 hour. The plates were washed thoroughly and an antibody against HSA, Fibrinogen or Antithrombin III (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) was added. Plates were washed again and a secondary peroxidase labeled antibody was added to detect the primary antibody in concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. 100 ml ATBS substrate was given to each well, the plates were wrapped to shield from light, incubated at room temperature and the absorbance was read at OD 492.

Overlap sensorgrams, which show binding of Idea-ATIII to immobilized HIV-1-gp120, CD4 and PDI and subsequent dissociation were created.

Measuring the HIV-1 major capsid protein p24 antigen in cell culture supernatant is a long-established method for virus quantification. While unmodified pooled plasma proteins did not reduce the amount of p24 in the cell supernatant (Fig. 3B) Idea-PP decreased the p24 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D: IC90 11 mg/ml, IC50 30 mg/ml; Fig. 3F: IC90 2 mg/ml, IC50",
