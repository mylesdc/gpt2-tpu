In this study, 211 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 25 farms across six provinces in China, between November 2017 and September 2018. 20.4% of the samples were detected as BNoV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on RdRp, VP1, and VP2 fragments revealed these BNoV strains had unique evolutionary characteristics. The complete genome of strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH was successfully sequenced. It was 7321 nucleotides (nt) in length, shared 79.4-80.9% nt identity with all five BNoV genomes, clustered on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH could represent a novel BNoV strain. Two interesting characteristics were found in the genome: (i) the VP1 sequence differed greatly from known BNoV VP1 sequences; (ii) a recombination event is predicted within the ORF1-ORF2 overlap. Moreover 16.3% (7/43) of the BNoV were identified as the novel VP1 genotype, which were distributed on four farms across two provinces, indicating that the novel VP1 genotype strain has spread. To our knowledge, this is first description of the molecular and genomic characteristics of BNoV in China. These findings extend our understanding of the genetic evolution and epidemics of BnoV.",

The P2 domain and P1 interface loop are involved in the binding of ABO histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are associated with its hosts' susceptibility to NoV infection 22, 23 . Different NoV VP1 genotypes may have different abilities to bind HBGAs. For example, the GII.4 viruses are thought to bind a wider range of HBGAs and therefore have larger susceptible populations than the other genotypes 24 . A three-dimensional model was generated based on the X-ray crystallographic structure of the BNoV VP1 P domain and showed that Bo/BET-17/18/CH was most similar to that of strain Jena (GIII.1), although it has a longer interface loop (Fig. 4) . Strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH also has many amino acid mutations in VP1, especially in the P2 domain. These variations in VP1 may have implications for the interaction between the novel VP1 genotype and HBGAs. The interactions between the different VP1 genotypes and HBGAs warrant further study.",

The major parent was strain Bo/Adam/2006/No (GenBank accession number JX145650), but the minor parent was not found. Similar phenomena have been reported in human NoV and porcine NoV [25] [26] [27] , which may be attributable to the limited number of NoV sequences available. RNA recombination is considered to be one of the main drivers of NoV evolution 24 . The majority of intergenotype and intragenotype recombination events in NoV, including BNoV, occur at a single location in the ORF1-ORF2 overlap 28, 29 . Recombination at this junction allows the virus to alter its viral capsid while retaining the region involved in the replication of the viral genome. This reorganization can also allow the virus to escape herd immunity 24 . As an example, the recombinant type GII.Pb/GII.3 is one of the most prevalent NoV, and still prevalent today in children 30 . Until now, two recombinant types have been identified in BNoV: one is GIII.2-related RdRp sequence and a GIII.1-related capsid sequence, and the other is GIII.1-related RdRp sequence and a GIII.2-related capsid sequence. The second recombinant type is circulating in different geographic regions [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, the first recombinant type has only been reported in the United States 34 . Interestingly, strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH is the strain of a recombination event involving a GIII.2-related RdRp sequence and a novel genotype-related capsid sequence. The prevalence of the novel strain must be monitored further.",

These seven strains were from four farms across two provinces that are more than 3000 km apart, indicating that this new genotype has spread across local provinces (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, on the farms positive for the novel VP1 genotype, the proportions of the novel genotype in the BNoV-positive samples were 1/1, 1/2, 2/2, and 3/4.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the molecular and genomic characteristics of BNoV in China. These findings will extend our understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of BNoV. Screening for novel VP1 genotypes in BNoV-positive samples. To investigate the prevalence of the novel VP1 genotype, a pair of primers was firstly designed to screen potential novel VP1 sequences with 467 bp (located at nt 5240-5706 in reference genome Bo/BET-17/18/CH; GenBank accession number MK159169), the primer sequences were BNV-S-F, 5\u2032-CCCCAGGGTGAGTTTACG-3\u2032 and BNV-S-R, 5\u2032-GGAGGGACCAGGAAGAAGA-3\u2032. Then, two pairs of primers were designed to amplify the complete novel VP1 gene from target samples according to the genome Bo/BET-17/18/CH. The primer sequences were as follows: BNV-cap-F1: 5\u2032-ACGACGATCCGAGTGAAA-3\u2032 and BNV-cap-R1: 5\u2032-AGTTGTGGTCCCAAGAAGC-3\u2032 (the amplicon product is 1068 bp long and located at nt 4817-5884 in reference genome Bo/BET-17/18/CH); and BNV-cap-F2: 5\u2032-CCAATCTGCCAATCTCGG-3\u2032 and BNV-cap-R2: 5\u2032-GGGCCATTCCAATCAAGC-3\u2032(the amplicon product is 1181 bp long and located at nt 5742-6922 in reference genome Bo/BET-17/18/CH).",

Sequence, phylogenic, and recombination analyses, and molecular modeling. The sequences were assembled with the SeqMan software (version 7.0; DNASTAR Inc., WI, USA). To analyze the genome organization, the putative ORFs and their corresponding amino acids were predicted with the ORF Finder tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homologies were determined with the MegAlign program of the DNASTAR 7.0 software (DNASTAR Inc). Pairwise distances between the amino acid sequences of VP1 (with gaps) were calculated with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model in the MEGA 7.0 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining method in the MEGA 7.0 software, with a bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates.
