Upon binding to double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA, OAS proteins and cGAS produce nucleotide second messengers to activate RNase L and STING (stimulator of interferon genes, gene symbol: TMEM173), respectively; this leads to the initiation of antiviral responses. We analyzed the evolutionary history of the MB21D1-TMEM173 and OAS-RNASEL axes in primates and bats and found evidence of widespread positive selection in both orders. In TMEM173, residue 230, a major determinant of response to natural ligands and to mimetic drugs (e.g., DMXAA), was positively selected in Primates and Chiroptera. In both orders, selection also targeted an a-helix/loop element in RNase L that modulates the enzyme preference for single-stranded RNA versus stem loops. Analysis of positively selected sites in OAS1, OAS2, and MB21D1 revealed parallel evolution, with the corresponding residues being selected in different genes. As this cannot result from gene conversion, these data suggest that selective pressure acting on OAS and MB21D1 genes is related to nucleic acid recognition and to the specific mechanism of enzyme activation, which requires a conformational change. Finally, a population genetics-phylogenetics analysis in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas detected several positively selected sites in most genes. Data herein shed light into species-specific differences in infection susceptibility and in response to synthetic compounds, with relevance for the design of synthetic compounds as vaccine adjuvants.",

Upon binding to DNA, cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which functions as a second messenger and binds the stimulator of interferon genes (STING, official gene symbol: TMEM173). STING, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), can also sense cyclic dinucleotides of prokaryotic origin and is targeted by different viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus. cGAS can detect a wide range of viruses and shares structural and functional features with OAS1 (2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthase 1). Although they are not phylogenetically related, OAS1 and cGAS display similar structural fold and activation mechanisms, and both enzymes produce atypical nucleotide second messengers. In fact, OAS1 and its paralogs, OAS2 and OAS3, have long been known to bind viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to catalyze the synthesis of 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylates, which specifically activate the latent form of RNase L (Hovanessian et al. 1977; Kerr and Brown 1978) . Inhibition of viral propagation is eventually achieved by RNase L through RNA degradation and induction of apoptosis.",

            "text": "Because of their direct role in PAMP recognition, PRRs and their downstream effectors are constantly involved in genetic conflicts with pathogens and, as a consequence, are commonly targeted by positive selection (Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010; Areal et al. 2011; Cagliani, Forni, Tresoldi, et al. 2014; Cagliani, Forni, Biasin, et al. 2014; Tenthorey et al. 2014) . RNase L, for example, evolved adaptively in Primates, with most positively selected sites located in protein domains that directly contact the viral genetic material (Jin et al. 2012) . This is in line with the host-pathogen arms race scenario, whereby protein regions directly involved in the recognition and binding of pathogen-derived components should evolve under the strongest selective pressure. This implies that species-specific differences in the function of PRRs or of their downstream effectors may be common. In the case of TLRs, for instance, the same receptor in distinct species may recognize different ligands or the same ligand with different affinity (Werling et al. 2009 ). Therefore, studying the pattern of interspecies evolution may provide valuable information on the differential susceptibility to infection within and among species. Primates, for example, show marked differences in the susceptibility and severity of several viral infections including those caused by HIV/SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus), HCV, HBV, and Varicella-zoster virus (Varki 2000; Willer et al. 2012) . Moreover, several emerging and re-emerging viral diseases affecting humans originate through the zoonotic transmission from a reservoir animal host (Jones et al. 2008) . Recent examples of pathogen spillover events include the Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) viruses: Both originated in bats and subsequently spread to humans either directly or through an intermediate host (Wang et al. 2011; Cotten et al. 2013) . Indeed, bats (Chiroptera) have long been known to harbor and disseminate a wide range of viruses that are highly pathogenic for humans. In addition to Ebola virus and MERS-CoV, notable examples include henipaviruses (e.g., Nipah and Hendra viruses), which cause a high fatality rate in humans and other mammals, hepaciviruses, influenza A viruses, as well as a range of paramyxoviruses (Calisher et al. 2006; Drexler et al. 2012; Tong et al. 2012; Quan et al. 2013) . With the exception of lyssavirus (e.g., rabies virus), bats are symptomless carriers of these human viral pathogens (Field et al. 1999 ). On the one hand, the observation whereby several Chiroptera families harbor a range of viral species suggests that bats have been coevolving with viruses for a long time and have adapted to high viral exposure. On the other hand, the wide variety of viral families hosted by bats indicates that adaptation most likely involved genes with a role in immune response, rather than molecules acting as incidental viral receptors (as different viruses use distinct strategies to invade the host). Thus, innate immunity genes that are devoted to antiviral response represent excellent candidates as adaptive selection targets in Chiroptera. A recent comparison of two bat genomes (Pteropus alecto and Myotis davidii) reported adaptive evolution at such genes, including TLR7 and TBK1, this latter encoding an interactor of STING (Zhang, Cowled, et al. 2013) . Nonetheless, fast evolutionary rates at immune response loci are a common feature of mammalian genomes and surely do not represent a bat-specific trait (Barreiro and Quintana-Murci 2010; Zhang, Cowled, et al. 2013) .",

The models are compared through likelihood-ratio tests (LRT) (degree of freedom = total number of branches \u00c0 1). In order to identify specific branches with a proportion of sites evolving with o > 1, we used branch site-random effects likelihood (BS-REL) (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2011) . This method implements branch-site models that simultaneously allow o variation across branches and sites. BS-REL requires no prior knowledge about which lineages are more likely to have experienced episodic diversifying selection. Branches identified using this approach were cross-validated with the branchsite LRT from PAML (the so-called modified model A and model MA1, \"test 2\") (Zhang et al. 2005) . A false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to account for multiple hypothesis testing (i.e., we corrected for the number of tested lineages), as suggested (Anisimova and Yang 2007) . MEME and BEB analysis from MA (with a cutoff of 0.90) were used to identify sites that evolve under positive selection on specific lineages (Zhang et al. 2005) .",

T181 immediately flanks the second ER retention signal in the protein sequence ( fig. 2) . Interestingly, we also found R78, that is part of the first RXR retention minimal motif (Sun et al. 2009 ), as positively selected in the chimpanzee lineage. Other primates display amino acids different from arginine at this position, suggesting variable localization of STING in distinct species (supplementary fig. S2 , Supplementary Material online). Position 230 was identified as positively selected both in the primate and in the bat phylogenies. This site is also polymorphic in human populations (G230A, rs78233829). Residue 230 is located in a loop forming the lid region that clamps onto the cyclic dinucleotide binding pocket of the receptor; mutations of this residue affect the conformation of the protein C-terminal domain and also the binding to cyclic dinucleotides, as well as to pharmacological mimetic drugs (Gao, Ascano, Zillinger, et al. 2013; Yi et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2014) (fig. 6) .",

(2012) and detected few more sites, possibly as a result of increased species number. Most positively selected sites detected by gammaMap or BEB/ MEME localize to the ankyrin domain, whereas residues 379 and 439 (positively selected in primates and bats, respectively) lie in the ATP binding pocket of the kinase-like domain ( fig. 7A ). Although this domain lacks the phosphotransfer activity, nucleotide binding is maintained and required for the assembly of a functional RNase dimer (Huang et al. 2014) . In bats we also found a positively selected site at position 680, within a positively charged residue patch ( 677 KHKKMKLK 684 , human sequence) that possibly interacts with the acidic ankyrin domain (Tanaka et al. 2004) (fig. 7B ). The interaction is thought to inhibit RNase L activity in absence of 2 0 -5 0 poliadenylates. In Chiroptera, this position is mainly occupied by hydrophobic residues such as valine and tryptophan ( fig. 7B ). Finally, positively selected sites were detected in the RNase domain: Most of these (E638, C639, K642, E649, R651, and N653) are part of a a-helix/loop element (HLE) that creates the substrate-binding pockets ( fig. 7B ). Deletions in the HLE modulate the substrate preference of human RNase L (Korennykh et al. 2009; Han et al. 2014 ).",

In fact, genetic data revealed that, among environmental factors, pathogens represented the strongest selective pressure for humans (Fumagalli et al. 2011) and several reports used inter-or intraspecies diversity data to describe widespread adaptive evolution at immune response loci (Barreiro and Quintana-Murci 2010; Daugherty and Malik 2012; Quintana-Murci and Clark 2013) . Specific selective events act to increase the host resistance against one or more pathogens and ample evidence indicates that the selective pressure exerted by past infections contributed to shaping the susceptibility to present-day pathogens (Kaiser et al. 2007; Emerman and Malik 2010) . Also, it has previously been suggested that, by generating diversity, selection may induce species-specific differences in the response to pharmacological compounds (e.g., vaccine adjuvants), suggesting caution when extrapolating results obtained in model organisms (Werling et al. 2009; Forni et al. 2013) . For these reasons, evolutionary analyses of immune response genes may provide valuable information on the molecular determinants underlying species-specific infection susceptibility and may clarify the differential response to natural or synthetic molecules.",

These latter were included because of the exceptional wide range of viruses they host without developing evident pathology. Only six bat species are presently available for analysis, possibly resulting in low accuracy and power in positive selection tests (Anisimova et al. 2001) . Although we limited the false positive rate by using two different methods to declare a site as positively selected, we may have failed to detect some true positives. Indeed, fewer selected sites were generally detected in Chiroptera than in Primates. Taking this limitation into account, we note that several selected sites were identified in the bat TMEM173 and RNASEL genes, suggesting that selective pressure in these mammals was comparatively stronger for downstream effectors than for PRRs, in accordance with the higher average dN/dS values ( fig. 2 ).",

This site lies in the flexible loop that acts as a lid above the cyclic dinucleotide binding pocket of the receptor . 6 ). Substitutions at this site greatly affect the response to natural ligands and to mimetic drugs, such as DMXAA (Yi et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2014) . In humans, positions 230 and 232 are polymorphic (G230A and H232R). Different alleles at these sites affect STING binding specificity for different substrates, including the canonical 3 0 -5 0 cyclic dinucleotides, known to be synthesized by bacteria, and the noncanonical [G(2 0 -5 0 )pA(3 0 -5 0 )p] cyclic dinucleotide, that contains a single 2 0 -5 0 phosphodiester bond and is produced by mammalian cGAS (Ablasser et al. 2013; Diner et al. 2013; Gao, Ascano, Wu, et al. 2013; Zhang, Shi, et al. 2013) . Although G230 displays a substrate specificity restricted to the noncanonical dinucleotides, the G230A substitution enhances signal transduction at very low concentrations of canonical dinucleotides, because the flexibility of the loop is increased and favors the structural changes that occur upon ligand binding (Yi et al. 2013) . Furthermore, even though H232R was demonstrated to be critical for the responsiveness to canonical dinucleotides, the coupled substitution G230A is required to restore a complete enzyme activation on these substrates (Diner and Vance 2014) .",

Although the C-terminal motif ( 178 RIR 180 ) was shown to be more important for ER retention, mutagenesis of the N-terminal signal ( 78 RYR 80 ) resulted in a decreased ER localization of the protein (Sun et al. 2009 ). Analysis in primates revealed that additional species lack the 78 RXR 80 signal. In bats, with the exclusion of the big brown bat, which has an intact second motif ( 178 RIR 180 ), no RXR motif is present in STING, nor is any of the other two motifs (KKXX and H/KDEL) usually associated with ER localization (Sun et al. 2009 ). The mitochondrial localization of human STING initially reported by Zhong et al. (2009) has remained controversial (Ishikawa and Barber 2008; Burdette and Vance 2013) . Recently, it has been suggested that the protein localizes to mitochondria-associated membranes, where its interaction with MAVS and RIG-I occurs (Scott 2009; Horner et al. 2011 ). It will be interesting to assess whether species-specific differences in TMEM173 localization exist and how these affect immune response and interaction with viral-encoded inhibitors (Burdette and Vance 2013) .",

Experiments in cell lines indicated that human RNase L cleaves HCV RNA predominately at UA and UU dinucleotides within loops of predicted stem-loop structures (Han and Barton 2002) . More recently, a phylogenetically conserved RNA structure in the open reading frame of poliovirus (and other group C enteroviruses) was found to function as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L (Han et al. 2007) . Specific stem loops motifs were found to be important for the inhibitory activity and to account for unusual resistance of poliovirus to RNase L-mediated cleavage (Townsend et al. 2008) . Thus, positively selected sites in the HLE represent excellent candidates as modulators of RNase L cleavage rate or susceptibility to inhibitors.",

We found several positively selected sites to be located in the relatively short cGAS-specific zinc ribbon domain. This structure is thought to act as a molecular ruler and to endow cGAS with the ability of binding the B-form but not A-form of nucleic acids, which is instead recognized by OAS1 (Civril et al. 2013; Gao, Ascano, Wu, et al. 2013; Kranzusch et al. 2013) . Thus, positive selection in this domain may act to hone in the function of this protruding loop, which is responsible both for nucleic acid recognition and for protein dimerization, two essential steps for full enzyme activation (Li et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "Human cGAS and OAS1 recognize nucleic acids through sequence-independent interactions to the minor groove, mainly mediated by a positively charged platform on the protein surface (Hornung et al. 2014) . A long alpha helix, called \"spine\" helix, opposite to the active site crevice, is the major structural component of the platform (Hornung et al. 2014) . For an efficient activation in vitro, human OAS1 and cGAS require dsRNA molecules greater than 17 bp long (Donovan et al. 2013) and dsDNA molecules greater than 20 bp (Kranzusch et al. 2013) , respectively. Intriguingly, we found positively selected sites at the double ends of the spine helix of both proteins, as shown by the superimposition of the 3D structures. As cGAS and OAS1 use double-stranded acid topology to distinguish between DNA and RNA and for specific self-activation upon binding, domains directly involved in nucleic acid recognition may have evolved adaptively to respond to specific PAMPs or to optimize enzyme activation. A similar evolutionary scenario has been recently proposed for positively selected sites in the pincer region of RIG-I, another PRR (Lemos de Matos et al. 2013; Cagliani, Forni, Tresoldi, et al. 2014; Rawling et al. 2015) . Thus, the selective pressure acting on OAS and MB21D1 genes may be related to PAMP recognition and to the specific mechanism of enzyme activation, which envisages a conformational change. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that natural selection often targeted residues located in the same spatial position in different proteins. In this respect, we should add that the duplication events that originated the OAS gene family occurred before the radiation of mammalian lineages, although more recent expansions occurred in rodents (Kumar et al. 2000) . Consequently, OAS family genes are quite divergent in sequence and the possibility that gene conversion between paralogs contributes substantially to their evolution has previously been dismissed (Ferguson et al. 2012) . Likewise, gene conversion events between the OAS1 and MB21D1 coding regions are extremely unlikely, as the two genes display limited sequence identity, despite the extensive structural and functional similarities. Thus, the several instances of corresponding positions which were targeted by positive selection in OAS1 and OAS2, as well as OAS1 and MB21D1, should be regarded as independent events resulting from selection.",

Based on these structural similarities Kranzusch et al. (2014) showed that single amino acid replacements around the cGAS binding site alter the enzyme's linkage specificity. Although the selected sites in STING may affect the specificity for products with different phosphodiester bonds, we did not detect positively selected sites in or near the cGAS active site, suggesting that the major selective pressure acting on the enzyme was not related to changes in STING ligand specificity. Evolutionary analyses on additional species will be required, though, to address the potential of coevolution for cGAS product specificity and STING binding preferences (Kranzusch et al. 2014) .",

We analyzed these same species and did not detect a similar trend.
