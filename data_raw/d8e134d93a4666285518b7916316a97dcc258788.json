Disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing foreign glycoproteins (GP) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers. Here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which encodes CCHFV structural glycoproteins. This construct drives strong expression of CCHFV-GP, in vitro. Using these vectors, we vaccinated STAT-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for CCHFV. The vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of CCHFV. Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals. This study demonstrates that a rVSV expressing only the CCHFV-GP has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against CCHF infections.",

Vaccine candidate approaches have focused on either DNA expression of CCHFV antigens in host tissues, replication deficient viral-like particles, inactivated whole virus preparations, subunit antigen preparations, or vectored vaccinia virus vaccines 16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Two of these preparations, a prime and boost strategy using modified recombinant Vaccinia virus (strain: Ankara) [MVA] encoding the GPC, and a prime, boost, and boost strategy with a DNA based vaccine encoding separate NP, G N , and G C antigens, have provided promising results with up to 100% protection in the IFNAR mouse model for CCHFV 23, 25 .

The principal reservoirs for CCHFV are ixodid hard ticks primarily belonging to the genus Hyalomma 2 . These ticks maintain the virus in nature by feeding on small mammals, ungulates, and birds within thirty countries across the Eastern hemisphere 3 . Human infection can occur from the bite of an infected tick, exposure to infected animal products, or through nosocomial transmission 4 . CCHFV case-fatality rates in most outbreaks range from 3-30%, though higher rates have been documented in some instances 3, 5 . CCHFV is categorized as a Category A priority pathogen by the US National Institutes of Health due to its associated morbidity and mortality, potential for public health/societal impact, as well as a lack of approved therapeutic options or US/EU licensed vaccines for treatment. The guanosine analogue ribavirin has been suggested as a therapeutic when given early in human infections; however, efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials for CCHF 6 . For these reasons, vaccines and therapeutic countermeasures against CCHFV are currently under development.",

The M-segment contains a 5.1 kilobase open-reading frame which codes for a glycoprotein precursor polypeptide (GPC) 7 . Host cell processing, cleavage events, and post-translational modifications of this GPC yield the two mature structural glycoproteins G N and G C , along with several non-structural glycoproteins which aid in structural G N and G C maturation [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The two glycoproteins are likely responsible for pertinent events in the viral replication cycle such as viral attachment, cell entry, tissue tropism(s), and induction of protective immune response as seen similarly with other members of Bunyavirales 13, 14 . The latter has been demonstrated for CCHFV using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against G N and G C , which have demonstrated in vitro neutralization in tissue culture and in vivo passive protection in suckling mice [13] [14] [15] .

These monolayers with CPE were harvested for RNA and were stained for CCHFV-GPC antigens via immunofluorescence assay and found to be positive (data not shown). This replication competent construct was designated \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig. 1B) . Sanger sequencing of both constructs, using primers for the VSV backbone and CCHFV-GPC ORF, was carried out which confirmed a rVSV\u0394G-CCHFV-GPC genome and revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (data not shown). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed to confirm Sanger results and further detail the SNPs within the entire genomes of both constructs (Supplemental Table 1 ). NGS sequencing demonstrated fourteen identical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) preserved between the replication deficient and replication competent constructs; with the replication competent construct possessing four additional non-synonymous mutations within the CCHFV-GPC (Fig. 1B , Supplemental Table 1 ); henceforth referred to as GPC\u0394. Two of these mutations within the CCHFV-GPC of the replication competent construct, resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the C-terminal tail of the G C (Fig. 1B) .",

We used Coomassie staining and western blot analysis on gradient purified \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 and semi-purified rVSV-GFP and CCHFV (as controls). Through Coomassie staining, differences in number and mobility of protein bands were detected among the wt rVSV-GFP and \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig. 2C , Lanes 1, 2). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant had additional protein bands below 20 kDa with analogous bands detected in CCHFV virion pellets (Fig. 2C , Lanes 2, 3). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant also possessed more pronounced protein bands at 60 kDa, compared to our wt rVSV-GFP (Fig. 2C , Lanes 1, 2). CCHFV structural glycoproteins G N and G C present as bands of approximately at 37 kDa and 75 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C , Lane 3), on SDS-PAGE gels 7 . There was no observable G N band found on the CCHFV-GPC recombinant at 37 kDa; however, there were two distinct bands between 60-80 kDa in the recombinant (Fig. 2C, Lanes 2) . The \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 did not encode for a VSV-G (which was confirmed by our deep sequencing shown in Supplemental Table 1 ), nor was it complemented with VSV-G after seven rounds of BHK passaging. A duplicate protein gel was run and further probed by western blotting using a MAb previously identified to be specific for CCHFV-G C by western blot (MAb 11E7, BEI Resources) 14 as there is currently, no available antibody that probes solely mature G N by western blot. These western blot data demonstrated limited, non-specific binding to three VSV proteins as observed in lanes rVSV-GFP (Fig. 2D , Lane 1), but showed strong signal to at least two antigens at approximately 75 kDa and 150 kDa for \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig. 2D, Lane 2 ). This Indicated that mature CCHFV-G C and potentially a precursor molecule or an oligomeric form of CCHFV-G C (due to the lack of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in antigen preparations), are incorporated in/on \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 virions. The semi-purified CCHFV also showed limited non-specific binding to antigens at 57 kDa (CCHFV-NP) and 37 kDa (CCHFV-G N ), but distinct signal at 75 kDa (CCHFV-G C ) (Fig. 2D , Lane 3).",

In pilot studies (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) the replication deficient construct (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC), failed to provide protection; however the replication competent (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394) construct did demonstrate some protection depending on dose.

As a control, we used PBS as a mock vaccination. A single mouse succumbed in the boosted group (leaving only four mice to be challenged in the boosted group) the day of boosting. At 35 days post prime, all mice were challenged with 50 pfu of CCHFV strain Turkey2004 and were monitored for clinical signs, weights, and temperatures. We challenged with a human/clinical strain, Turkey200406546, designated throughout this work as Turkey2004; which has previously been published in GenBank with the accession numbers KY362517 (S-segment), KY362519 (M-segment), and KY362515 (L-segment) 41 .

Additionally, the CCHFV-GPC can form immature CCHFV particles at the Golgi and egress via vesicular transport 14, 44 . Unlike CCHFV, VSV buds from the plasma membrane 45 , which hampers efforts to recover a replicating \u0394GrVSV vector with CCHFV-GPC expressed. We used a mammalian www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ codon optimized CCHFV-GPC which has demonstrated expression of CCHFV-G C to the cell surface 20 , while maintaining native CCHFV-GPC maturation factors. We hypothesized that this expression due to codon optimization could facilitate shuttling of CCHFV-GP to the plasma membrane where VSV could acquire and bud with functional components of the GPC in the viral envelope. Although we were able to drive strong expression CCHFV-GPC in vitro, we were unable to generate a replication competent pseudotype virus without initially using VSV-G* in trans. There have been multiple studies that have examined pseudotyping rVSV with a CCHFV-GPC using a plasmid encoding a VSV\u0394G backbone. A luciferase reporter pseudotype with in trans expression of the CCHFV-GPC was developed in 293 T cells by Shtanko et al. 43 . Suda et al., also performed similar pseudotyping with in trans expression in 293 T cells with various full length GPC and modified GPC constructs containing truncated G C C-terminal/endodomain tails 42 . These pseudotypes also had a luciferase or GFP ORFs genomically encoded in the VSV\u0394G backbone 42 . Both published pseudotyped CCHFV-GPC systems were used for neutralization or entry/infection studies; however, these constructs were not characterized by western blot or immune electron microscopy to understand what is on the pseudotype envelope; nor were either constructs self-replicating or capable of further expressing antigen elements of CCHFV-GPC post infection 42, 43 .",

The current situation with reagents to mature CCHFV-G N limit assaying for this particular antigen, as commercially available antibodies only target the precursor molecule CCHFV-PreG N . Immune electron microscopy demonstrated that CCHFV-G C was incorporated on the surface of the virion. While we were able to immunolabel for CCHFV-G C , PAGE and Coomassie staining analysis of our purified virion lysates did not reveal prominent protein bands at the 37 kDa position, the estimated size of mature G N 7 . Nonetheless, we did have three smaller protein bands in the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 preparations. Similar protein profiles have been shown in other vectored CCHFV-GPC preparations, as shown by Buttigieg et al., 2014 . It is possible that these protein bands may also correspond to VSV-M2 and -M3 by alternative initiation at downstream start codons present in the ORF of VSV-M 46 . While not the focus of this current study, these observations warrant further characterization should this vector be used as a tool to further study CCHFV-GPC mechanisms.",

Our data supports this region as a probable, or at the very least, contributory mechanism which enables the replication competent \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 pseudotype formation, as our pseudotype also was found to contain a C-terminal CCHFV-G C tail truncation (Fig. 1B) . There is likely a localization or retention signal within the transmembrane region or endodomain tail which is aberrated and fails to transport CCHFV-G C solely to the intracellular compartments; this may in turn permit shuttling to the plasma membrane. Once again this is not the focus of this study, although it will be examined in the future. It is interesting to note, that a similar motif has been demonstrated by other bunyaviruses 47, 48 and has also been demonstrated with other VSV pseudotypes 49 . Structural CCHFV-G C has been shown to be an important protein for CCHFV and contains a putative receptor binding region for mammalian cell surface nucleolin 50 , a class II viral fusion domain 51 , a neutralization epitope 13 , and human linear B-cell epitope sites 52, 53 .

This has hampered the STAT-1 \u2212/\u2212 animal platform from serving as a vaccine development tool, as 'vaccinated' mice succumb to a prime dosing 56 . Because of this information we conducted several pilot studies examining effective dosing and challenge strategies, for both the replication deficient (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC) and replication competent (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394) construct.

Curiously, our boosted (10 7 pfu) group had lower detectable antibodies to the CCHFV-GPC with lower neutralization titers (Fig. 5A,B) . Clinical data for these groups following CCHFV challenge show that the prime only group had elevated temperatures and weight loss, additionally two animals from this cohort displayed clinical signs including roughed fur indicating illness from the CCHFV challenge (Fig. 4B,C, data not shown) . While the boosted group did display elevated temperatures, there was neither substantial weight loss detected nor observable changes in clinical scoring for any of the animals (Fig. 5B ,C, and data not shown). Further analysis of tissues at study end point for these cohorts also revealed that while there was no immunolabeling in the liver of the vaccinated animals, the prime cohort had diffuse cytoplasmic immunolabeling of mononuclear cells in the spleen sections (Fig. 6E ). This finding, along with the clinical scores, suggested that there was more replication of CCHFV in the prime group compared to the boosted group. This could potentially lead to the higher anti-CCHFV-GPC IgG titers in the prime cohort at the study endpoint as the CCHFV challenge may have served as a heterologous booster, increasing levels when compared to the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 boosted cohort (Fig. 5A,B) . Regardless, protection was achieved by both regimens, although the boosted group data suggests that at study endpoint, the observed IgG titers against CCHFV-GPC along with lower neutralizing titers (PRNT 50 of < 1:320) are evidence of the ability to combat lethal CCHFV infection in the STAT-1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse model after vaccination (Fig. 5A,B) .",

Several CCHFV experimental vaccines studies have identified cell-mediated and humoral involvement, with some instances of neutralizing antibody production 24, 57 . In looking at what is known for human CCHF, survivors mount a humoral response whereas those who succumb, typically lack an IgG response 3 . Other studies have examined antibody and neutralizing responses from the various vaccine platforms. DNA vaccines following a three round vaccination regimen have induced detectable antibodies with neutralizing capacity observed up to 1:160 in PRNT dilutions and achieved 100% protection, depending on the antigens encoded on the DNA plasmids 25, 58 . A cell culture based inactivated virus vaccine achieved high IgG titers (1:102,400) and a high neutralizing response of 1:1,024; however, this also required three vaccination rounds, an alum adjuvant, and conferred 80% protection against the clinical isolate Turkey-Kelkit06 in IFNAR mice 21 . Antibody titers, neutralization capacity, and challenge virus presented here were similar, though through the VSV platform, we achieved greater protection with a single dose. These studies, along with our own, suggest other facets of the immune system are likely involved in conferring complete protection.",

The replication competent construct provides up to 100% protection with an observed humoral response, with a single-injection from a human isolate challenge strain. This information is valuable in designing future studies in CCHFV animal models, and establishes characterized tools to examine the biology of structural CCHFV-G C in a pseudotyped rVSV system.

The rVSV vector had the VSV glycoprotein open reading frame (yellow arrow) exchanged with the open reading frame coding for the full glycoprotein precursor gene (GPC) of CCHFV (red arrow). Using a T7 driven DNA clone recovery system, a complemented VSV-G* recombinant was generated containing the CCHFV-GPC open reading frame (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC). (B) Generating a replication competent vaccine vector: VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC is infectious due to the VSV-G* complementation; however, VSV-G is needed in trans to effectively replicate in cell culture. Multiple passages of this vector through VSV-G* complemented and un-complemented BHK cells resulted in a replication competent vaccine vector (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394). Next generation sequencing revealed six nonsynonymous mutations in the open reading frame of the CCHFV-GPC. These mutations resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the end of GPC C-terminal tail of the glycoprotein (G C ).",
