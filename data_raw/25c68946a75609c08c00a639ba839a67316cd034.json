In fact, the real CPIs can be divided into two categories according to CPI duration, namely, the transient CPIs formed by purely random human interactions, and regular CPIs representing meaningful interactions among students [1] . Thus, we employed a mixture statistical model to describe the CPI durations, and determined the optimal duration threshold to distinguish these two categories. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 , the CPI duration histogram of the SCAU network on November 18, 2011 shows two peaks, where the left peak (denoting transient CPIs) can be approximated by a geometric distribution, and the right one (denoting regular CPIs) can be approximated by a Poisson distribution.",

However, this is not an inherent drawback as we can demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, that the network characteristics of CC, strength distribution are insensitive to the sample size. In other words, the sample size in the study is sufficient for most of the network analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S10 ). Suppose that the underlying CPI network (denoted as A) among the whole community has N nodes and M edges, and the acquired CPI network (denoted as B, which is a random sample of A) has n nodes and m edges.

During class cancelation period in boarding schools, all students are ordered to stay within the campus, with all classes cancelled, thus showing a CPI pattern nearly identical to that at weekends. In the study, class cancelation was simulated by simply replacing the CPI networks at weekdays with the CPI networks at weekends. Figure S1 : The characteristics of SCAU CPI networks on weekdays (A) and weekends (B). The characteristics include density (blue), CC (magenta), efficiency (green) and modularity (red). It can be observed that all CPI networks on weekdays show similar characteristics, and so do the CPI networks on weekends. The only exception is the CPI network on November 12th -there was an activity in SCAU, which results in relatively frequent transient interactions. These frequent transient interactions further lead to significantly low modularity. Figure S2 : Real CPI networks acquired on November 07 (Monday) and November 12 (Saturday), 2011 in USTB, denoted as (A) USTB1107 and (B) USTB1112, respectively. Here, a node represents an individual student, and if there is a CPI between two students, an edge is drawn between the two corresponding nodes with edge width proportional to the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day. Figure S3 : Histograms of CPI durations among SCAU volunteers on November 18, 2011. The histogram is approximated with the mixture of a geometric distribution and a Poisson distribution, plotted with red and blue lines, respectively. The inset shows in details two lines interacting at CPI = 6.5 scans, which implies that the contacts lasting less than or equal to 6 bluetooth scan (or 6 \u00d7 5 = 30 minutes) are transient interactions. Figure S4 : Degree distribution of real CPI networks acquired on November 1 (Tuesday, panels A and F), November 2 (Wednesday, panels B and G), November 3 (Thursday, panels C and H), November 4 (Friday, panels D and I), and November 6 (Sunday, panels E and I), 2011 in SCAU, denoted as SCAU1101, SCAU1102, SCAU1103, SCAU1104 and SCAU1106 respectively. Panels A-E are shown in linear scale, while panels F-J are shown in log-log scale. It can be observed that the CPI networks on weekdays (SCAU1101, SCAU1102, SCAU1103, SCAU1104) significantly deviate from idealized Poisson distribution of the counterpart uniformly-random network with the same number of nodes and edges. In contrast, the network on the weekend (SCAU1106) shows a power-law distribution. At each coverage level, a total of 100 random subsets of vertices were selected and 100 subgraphs were induced from these vertices. The figures indicate that the expected value of density and CC of subgraphs approximate that of the original networks. As expected, the higher coverage, the smaller variance of the characteristics.",

            "text": "coe cient of degree Pearson correlation coe cient of strength Average fraction of common neighbors Average fraction of repeated contacts The function of the similarity between two daily aggregation CPI networks on the time difference. The similarity measures include Pearson CC of degree, Pearson CC of strength, average fraction of common neighbors, and the ratio of common contacts. The statistics suggest a periodicity of about seven days, which is consistent with the school schedule. However, the similarities are not as strong as expected. SEIR simulation results over SCAU networks with transient CPIs (blue line) and without transient CPIs (red line). A collection of simulation results are shown here, including (A) total infected population ratio; (B) R 0 ; (c) peak time; and (d) epidemic duration. The removal of transient CPIs leads to significant deviation of epidemic behavior. SEIR parameters: \u03b4 \u22121 0 = 2 days, \u03b3 \u22121 0 = 3 days, and \u03b2 0 ranges from 0.1 to 7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 sec \u22121 . Comparison of SEIR simulations over real CPI networks (including USD, USHS, FRPS, and USTB CPI networks), and artificial CPI networks (including scale-free, small-world, and uniformly random networks). The artificial CPI networks were constructed with the identical number of nodes and edges to USTB networks. The figure shows a collection of simulation results, including (A) total infected population ratio; (B) R 0 , i.e., the expected number of cases infected directly from the index case; (C) peak time, i.e. the time of maximum infected cases and (D) epidemic duration, or the period of time from the introduction of the index case until recovery from the infection of the last case has occurred. SEIR parameters: 5days, and \u03b2 0 ranges from 0.1 to 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . For each parameter setting, the SEIR simulations were repeated 10,000 times with calculated mean values. SEIR simulation results over a sequence of CPI networks, which were constructed via different strategies, including (i) repetition of a certain day's network (SCAU1118); (ii) repetition of one week's CPI networks (SCAU1031-1106); and (iii) the original 28 days' CPI networks. A collection of simulation results were shown here, including (A) total infected population ratio; (B) R 0 , i.e., the expected number of cases infected directly from the index case; (C) peak time, i.e., the time of maximum infected cases and (D) epidemic duration, or the time period from the introduction of the index case until the recovery of the last case. SEIR parameters: \u03b4 \u22121 0 = 2 days, \u03b3 \u22121 0 = 1.5 days, and \u03b2 0 ranges from 0.1 to 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . For each parameter setting, the SEIR simulations were repeated 10,000 times with calculated mean values.
