Previous studies demonstrated that TGEV infection could lead to mitochondrial damage and upregulate miR-4331 level. So miR-4331 may play an important regulatory role in the control of mitochondrial function. To explore the potential role of miR-4331 in mitochondrial damage, we adopted a strategy consisting of quantitative proteomic analysis of porcine kidney (PK-15) cells in response to miR-4331 and TGEV infection. Eventually, 69 differentially expressed proteins were gained. The target of miR-4331 was identified. The effects of miR-4331 and its target RB1 on mitochondrial Ca 2\u0609 level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), p38 MAPK signaling pathway were investigated. The results showed that miR-4331 elevated mitochondrial Ca 2\u0609 level, reduced MMP, targets Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), upregulated IL1RAP, and induced activation of p38 MAPK pathway during TGEV infection. RB1 was identified as the direct targets of miR-4331 and downregulated IL1RAP, suppressed the activation of p38 MPAK, and attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage. In addition, IL1RAP played a positive role in activating p38 MAPK signaling and negative role in TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage. The data indicate that miR-4331 aggravates TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage by repressing expression of RB1, promoting IL1RAP, and ac-From the \u2021College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University,",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 1 is an enveloped enteropathogenic coronavirus with positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome (1) . TGEV infects pigs and especially causes piglets up to 14 days of age high mortality, which can reach to 100% (2, 3) and result in numerous economic losses. Our previous work demonstrated that TGEV infection can reduce MMP, leading to mitochondrial damage (4, 5) . Mitochondrion, an organelle of eukaryocyte, not only acts as the energy metabolism factory, but also is involved in many key biological processes, such as apoptosis, pathogenic infection (6, 7) . Mitochondrion is a very sensitive organelle to microenvironmental changes in cells and much easier becomes dysfunction than other organelles (8) . Mitochondria, the major source of energy, in the form of ATP, are closely interconnected with cell death. Ca 2\u03e9 is essential for maintain mitochondrial function. However, Ca 2\u03e9 accumulation in mitochondria can impair mitochondrial function, resulting in a transient depolarization of MMP and reducing ATP production (9 -11) . Both Ca 2\u03e9 accumulation and MMP depolarization can cause mitochondrial damage, so the alterations of Ca 2\u03e9 level and MMP are used to assess mitochondrial function (12) . miRNAs are small noncoding RNA species containing about 22 nucleotides and contribute to regulating many cellular processes including apoptosis, development, differentiation, and cell cycle (13) . We previously reported that miR-4331 level was upregulated during TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (14) . Whereas, whether miR-4331 participate in regulating TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage in PK-15 cells is unclear. According to GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of miR-4331 targets, miR-4331 targets can be enriched in mitochondria and mitochondria-related pathways. Therefore, we postulate miR-4331 can participate in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction in PK-15 cells. To investigate the regulatory effects of miR-4331 on TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage, miR-4331 mimics or mimics control was transfected into PK-15 cells and the proteomic analysis was performed using LC-MS/MS labeled by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT). Then we identified the targets of miR-4331 and detected the effects of miR-4331 target on mitochondrial damage and p38 MAPK pathway. We demonstrated that miR-4331 increased mitochondrial Ca 2\u03e9 level and decreased MMP via activating p38 MAPK pathway and upregulating expression of IL1RAP. Moreover, miR-4331 activated p38 MAPK pathway via targeting RB1 and upregulating IL1RAP. Our data suggest that miR-4331 could facilitate TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage in PK-15 cells via targeting RB1, promoting IL1RAP, and activating p38 pathway.",

It is reported that IL1RAP is a component of IL-1 protein complex (22) and IL-1 is a activator of p38 MAPK (23) . We previously found that TGEV infection reduced MMP and activated p38 MAPK pathway (5) . Therefore, we presume that IL1RAP might play a role in TGEVinduced decrease of MMP and activation of p38 MAPK. To explore the effects of IL1RAP on mitochondria and p38 MAPK pathway, we constructed pCI-neo-IL1RAP to overexpress IL1RAP and synthesized siRNA of IL1RAP, siIL1RAP, to silence IL1RAP. The results showed that pCI-neo-IL1RAP led to an increase IL1RAP at mRNA level (Fig. 8A ) and protein level (Fig. 8B) and siIL1RAP reduced mRNA level (Fig. 8A ) and protein level (Fig. 8B) . Mitochondrial Ca 2\u03e9 level was upregulated by pCI-neo-IL1RAP and downregulated by siIL1RAP (Fig. 8C ). In addition, MMP level was suppressed by pCI-neo-IL1RAP and increased by siIL1RAP (Fig. 8D ).

To investigate the effect of RB1 on TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage, three siRNAs of RB1, siRB1-1, siRB1-2, and siRB1-3, were synthesized and respectively transfected into PK-15 cells to silence RB1. The silencing efficiency of RB1 siRNAs were evaluated, showing siRB1-3 was the most effective siRNA for RB1 silencing (Fig. 12A and 12B) . Moreover, RB1 gene was cloned into eukaryotic expression plasmid pCI-neo, named pCI-neo-RB1, to overexpress RB1. pCI-neo-RB1 and pCIneo were respectively transfected into PK-15 cells, followed by evaluation of mRNA and protein level. Expectedly, both the mRNA and protein level were upregulated (Fig. 12C and 12D) . Then, PK-15 cells were transfected with either siRB1-3 or pCIneo-RB1 and subsequently infected with TGEV for 24 h. The mitochondrial Ca 2\u03e9 level and MMP were measured. The results showed that mitochondrial Ca 2\u03e9 level was decreased by pCIneo-RB1 and increased by siRB1-3 (Fig. 12E ).

RB1 is a suppressor of cell death via binding and repressing transcription factor E2Fs. The hypophosphorylated RB1, the active form of RB1, binds to and sequesters transcription factor E2F1 to operate as an inhibitor of E2Fs (25) . C-terminal region of RB1 has a E2F1-specific binding site that is sufficient to repress E2F1-induced apoptosis, so the C-terminal interaction site on RB1 acts as a potent inhibitor of E2F1 (26) . A pool of evidence shows RB1 localizes in mitochondria (27) . Therefore, a set of reports highlights a series of links between RB1 and mitochondrial function. RB1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis for erythropoiesis (28) . Loss of RB1 caused a decrease of mitochondrial mass, downregulated mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, MMP, and accumulation of hypopolarized mitochondria (29) , implying that suppression of RB1 leads to mitochondrial damage. These results further support our conclusion that RB1 weakens TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage. Here, RB1 was identified as the target of miR-4331 and inhibited by miR-4331. Whereas, RB1 was not identified as the differentially expressed protein using TMT, it may be because of low expression level of RB1 and the insufficient sensitivity of this technology. ",

IL-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine that can initiate a series of signaling resulting in activation of NF-B signaling pathway. IL-1 interacts with L1RAP and IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) to form IL-1 complex (31) , which mediates the activation of p38 MAPK signaling in presence of IL-1\u2424 treatment (32) . It is in consistent with our finding that IL1RAP can lead to the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. Moreover, we found miR-4331 caused an upregulation of RELA, which is the p65 subunit of NF-B. NF-B is a key activator of inflammation and is activated during TGEV infection (33, 34) . Therefore, we speculate miR-4331 may function as a regulator of TGEV-induced NF-B pathway through regulating IL1RAP and RELA.",
