Our analysis revealed the expression modulation of nearly 1060 such lncRNAs which are associated with differentially expressed mRNAs in active and latent infection. This suggests a greater role of lncRNAs in regulating transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression during HIV infection. The differentially expressed mRNAs were involved in several different biological pathways where immunological networks were most enriched. Importantly, we discovered that HIV induces expression reversal of more than 150 lncRNAs between its active and latent infection. Also, hundreds of unique lncRNAs were identified in both infection conditions. The pathology specific \"gene-expression reversal\" and \"on-and-off\" switching of lncRNAs and associated mRNAs may lead to establish the relationship between active and HIV infection.",

The major hindrance in this direction is the latent HIV infection in cell subpopulations where anti-HIV drugs and immune clearance is not effective. HIV can persist in these viral reservoirs for years with little or no productive infection and can reactivate later 1 . In contrast to initial belief, latent HIV reservoirs are present beyond the realm of memory CD4 + T cells 2-5 . Subpopulations of all kind of immune cells such as dendritic cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, natural killer cells, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, etc. also serve as HIV reservoirs. It is noteworthy to mention that infected/non-infected cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage naturally transmigrate to brain from peripheral circulation and vice-versa. This results in HIV dissemination into brain. CNS is also reported to be a major site of HIV reservoir 2,6 . Thus, macrophages/monocytes serve as major connecting link between peripheral and brain infection of HIV, be it active or latent 7 . It has been widely accepted that HIV latency is driven by multitude of epigenetic-based transcriptional factors after integration of pro-viral genomes into the host genome 8-10 . Role of histone modifications such as acetylation, methylation, etc. in HIV latency have already been shown in several studies [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, these factors proved not more than a fractional player and despite intensive efforts by global scientific community during last decade, the molecular essence of HIV latency still remains indistinct.",

As such, modulation of lncRNAs -which is emerging as a vital player at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level -may be a critical point of manipulation by obligate parasites such as HIV. In fact, few existing reports at this point suggests role of lncRNAs in activation of HIV replication and subsequent increase in virus production as well [20] [21] [22] . This provides a clue that defining lncRNAs contribution in HIV biogenesis may represent tools needed to beat the enigma behind latent and active infection. To best of our knowledge no studies, to-date, have been conducted to delineate variations in the lncRNAs profile between an active and latent HIV infection. Using microarray analysis we hereby, for the first time, report that active and latent HIV infection results in differential pattern of lncRNAs and mRNAs expression. Gene ontology and pathways analysis of upregulated and downregulated transcripts showed their relevance to several metabolic and biological processes. While both, active and latent infection shared common upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in compare to uninfected control, majority of them were uniquely expressed in both infections scenario. Importantly, a big chunk of these lncRNAs and mRNAs showed expression reversal when compared between active and latent infection and vice-versa. Also, more than one thousands of both, lncRNAs and their associated mRNAs were differentially expressed in active and/or latent infection. As such, this study may lead to decode illusionary linkage driving the HIV latency, which continues to be the biggest stumbling block in developing successful antiretroviral drug cocktails.",

Then, each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA along the entire length of the transcripts without 3\u2032 bias utilizing a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primers (Arraystar Flash RNA Labeling Kit, Arraystar). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Human LncRNA Array v3.0 (8 \u00d7 60 K, Arraystar). Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray V3.0 is designed for the global profiling of about 30,586 human LncRNAs. The LncRNAs are carefully constructed using the most highly-respected public transcriptome databases (Refseq, UCSC knowngenes, Gencode, etc), as well as landmark publications. Each transcript is represented by a specific exon or splice junction probe which can identify individual transcript accurately. Positive probes for housekeeping genes and negative probes are also printed onto the array for hybridization quality control. After having washed the slides, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C. Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using the GeneSpring GX v12.1 software package (Agilent Technologies).

            "text": "HIV latency is a state of replication restriction when either few viruses are reproduced or viruses are reproduced intermittently. The quantitative and/or temporal dimension of establishment of HIV persistence is determined by many factors such as cell's life span, their infection susceptibility and proliferative ability, alterations in cellular physiology and/or immunologic controls, etc. Cells of monocyte/macrophages lineage is one of the principal targets of HIV among others. These cells are more resistant -than CD4 + T or other cells -to the cytopathic effect induced via apoptosis during HIV infection. In turn, they make more stable hideouts and can harbor HIV for longer time. As an important viral reservoir, macrophages can disseminate HIV across all organ systems because of its universal presence in body 23 . A decade of efforts made in the direction of eliminating HIV reservoirs is strongly suggesting towards involvement of unknown, sophisticated epigenetic regulatory machinery that is beyond known landscape of histone modifications and small non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs. The complex paradigm of lncRNAs-based transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation is gradually being unfolded and evidences insinuate them as a central player in driving epigenetic remodeling in different non-viral 24 and viral disease systems such as SARS corona virus, influenza virus, Marek's disease virus, herpes simplex virus, etc. 17 . Couple of recent studies shows specific lncRNA-based modulation of HIV replication. Nonetheless, lncRNAs in these studies were selected based on their role in other diseases 21, 22 . Another study by Saayman et al. 24 expressed lncRNAs in latent infection. This difference in the no. of lncRNAs between active and latent infection may be attributed to the differences in the degree or intensity of epigenetic modifications during respective infection stages. The continued transcriptional suppression of HIV genome post-integration, for latency maintenance, may require greater degree of epigenomic involvement compared to active infection where epigenomic alterations may be of little significance. Moreover, intrinsic transcriptional originality of the cell lines may also partially contribute to these differences because promonocytic U1 latent cells, a subclone of U937, are chronically infected with HIV-1 compared to U-937 monocytes used for active HIV-1 infection. Many of these lncRNAs were specifically modulated during active or latent infection. Nonetheless a big amount of them were either upregulated or downregulated in both infection scenarios. These variations in lncRNAs expression between two different HIV infection conditions further substantiate the greater role of epigenetic regulators and that lncRNAs may have specific \"on-and-off \" switching mechanism to drive latent or active condition. Understanding such mechanism -if exists -can better be revealed by knowing their chromosomal locations and its relationship with nearby coding gene. We found that these modulated lncRNAs during HIV active or latent infection are distributed on both \"+ \" and \"\u2212 \" strand of different chromosomes and belongs to all groups: intergenic, intron sense-overlapping, exon-sense overlapping, natural antisense, intronic antisense, and bidirectional (supplementary data 1). This knowledge can certainly be helpful in determining lncRNAs associated host factors responsible for guiding epigenetic remodeling. A more holistic understanding of lncRNAs mechanism requires establishing their association with mRNAs. Several studies have shown that lncRNAs can behave as transcription enhancer or suppressor in an orientation-independent or dependent manner 25 . As such, we first established global profiling of mRNAs in both active and latent infection. With a profiling ability of 26,109 coding transcripts, we found 1125 and 7138 mRNAs differentially modulated during active and latent infection, respectively. Similar to lncRNAs, modulated mRNAs were specific to and shared by active and latent infection. This quantitative pattern of mRNA modulations between active and latent infection is in parallel with that of lncRNAs suggesting high degree of lncRNAs involvement in epigenetic modifications and subsequent transcriptional control. Importantly, this raises the possibility that HIV may induce parallel manipulation of lncRNAs and mRNAs as a mechanism to dominate host cellular machinery. Nonetheless, this parallel manipulation may exist for both unrelated or closely associated lncRNAs and mRNAs. We could establish about 1068 lncRNAs and associated mRNAs pair modulated during HIV active and/or latent infection. Role of lncRNAs in regulation of marker genes have been established in other diseases 25 . In fact, several of mRNAs from the modulated \"lncRNAs-mRNAs\" pair have been established in the HIV infection. For example, Histone deacetylase (HDAC) regulates transcription of numerous cellular and viral genes. It has been shown that the class I HDACs, HDAC1, \u2212 2, and \u2212 3, are recruited to the HIV-1 LTR in cell line models of HIV-1 latency 26 . The sub-class I selective inhibitors for HDAC1, \u2212 2, and \u2212 3 have shown to induce latent HIV-1 expression strongly in resting CD4 + T cells 27 . Moreover, tat induced upregulation of HDAC2 are also reported to induce transcriptional repression leading to neurocognitive impairment 28 . The RUNX protein, which works in combination with the co-factor CBF-\u03b2 , function as critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells 29 . RUNX1 bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR repressing the transcription. Lower expression of BDNF has been reported in HIV-infected individuals with HAD than in non-demented HIV 30 . The decrease in BDNF evoked by HIV is believed to contribute to the development of synaptic simplification and neuronal damage seen in HAD. BRCA1, which is present at the HIV-1 LTR in a highly relevant model of HIV infection, is another protein found to be important for viral transcription. The cells that lack BRCA1 have severely reduced HIV-1 Tat-dependent transcription 31 . Gain or loss-of-function studies have shown to enhance or decrease transcription. Moreover, BRCA1 has been shown to be in complex with pTEF-b, and Cyclin T1 has been shown to be an essential factor for BRCA1-dependent activation of RNAP II transcription.",

In fact, pathways and gene ontology analysis shows their involvement in 155 biological cycles where majority of enriched network belonged to immunological and inflammatory significance. This was expected because most infection including that by HIV induces immunological and inflammatory defense signaling. HIV infection induces various secondary infections and therefore enrichment of network associated with salmonella infection, influenza infection, herpes simplex virus infection, tuberculosis, pertussis, hepatitis B, staphylococcus infection, etc. may imply the likelihood of such opportunistic infections during HIV pathogenesis. Interestingly, enrichment of replication associated pathways (such as RNA transport pathway, Nucleotide excision pathway, Spliceosome pathway, and Pyrimidine metabolism, etc.) during latent infection suggest towards a highly sophisticated and regressive epigenetics overhauling in compare to active infection. This is also reflected in the quantitative differences of the total differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between active and latent infection. Now challenge ahead is to examine pathophysiological significant of these closely associated, differential expressed \"lncRNAs-mRNAs\" pair one by one. Nonetheless, active and latent stages are two opposite facet of the HIV infection and therefore, expression reversal of a specific gene set (Active upregulation/downregualtion < = > latent downregulation/ upregulation) between these two conditions cannot be excluded. It is possible that expression reversal of certain genes between active and latent infection, independently or together with the active and latent infection-specific uniquely modulated genes, can have remarkable pathophysiological significance. Genetic commonality (close association) may potentiate susceptibility of other related disorders. In fact, copy number variants and temporal expression differences of a specific gene associated with one neurological and autoimmune disorder can predispose to others 32 .
