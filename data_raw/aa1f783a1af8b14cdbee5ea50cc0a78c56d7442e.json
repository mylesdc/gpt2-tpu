            "text": "Emergence of a new influenza strain leads to a rapid global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody immunity. Preexisting CD8 + T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP 336-374 peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N-.A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8 + T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two Vb regions (Vb8.3 and Vb9). This can be partially explained by the H-2D b NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D b , including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the na\u00efve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt-.wt challenge. Such decreased CD8 + responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8 + T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.",

            "text": "Virus escape mutants are well documented for persistent infections and constitute a major problem for CD8 + T cellmediated control and vaccine design [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . With regard to the influenza A viruses, mutational changes driven by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are unlikely to result in long-term persistence within the individual, as other mechanisms (particularly antibody) can ultimately mediate virus clearance [10] . Even so, the fact that such mutants can be found in nature suggests that influenza virus-specific CTLs are of protective value. Perhaps this reflects that the infection of new subjects favours the selection of mutant viruses that are more slowly controlled (and thus shed for longer), particularly in the face of a seasonal ''bottleneck'' where much of the population is already immune [11] . In humans, influenza escape variants have been observed for CD8 + T cell epitopes presented in context of several HLAs, including HLA-B8, HLA-B27 and HLA-B35 [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . The immunogenic peptides can be modified at an MHC anchor residue, resulting in defective binding to the MHC-I glycoprotein, or at a TCR contact site. Mutations at TCR contact residues lead to partial (cross-reactive) or total (non-cross-reactive) loss of recognition by wt CD8 + T cells [13] , with some variants eliciting epitopespecific CD8 + T cell responses that are both novel and of substantial magnitude [12] .",

This raises the possibility that it might be worthwhile to think in terms of vaccinating against likely virus escape mutants. The present analysis focuses on the crossreactive (to wt D b NP 366 ) CD8 + T cell response to the mutant D b NPN3A epitope [22] formed by substitution of the partially solvent exposed, and non-prominent for TCR binding, residue at position (P) 3 of the influenza NP 366-374 peptide [21, 23] .

Such cross-reactive CD8 + T cell responses after NPN3A stimulation are not surprising as the partially solvent exposed P3N residue is unlikely to play any prominent role in contacting the TCR [23] . The wt NP 366-374 peptide binds to H-2D b in an extended conformation where the P2-Ser, P5-Asn and P9-Met are the anchor residues, P3-Asp is a semi-anchor (partially buried/partially exposed), and P4-Glu, P6-Met, P7-Glu and P8-Thr are solvent exposed and available for contact by the TCR (Fig. 1) . This provides the basis for a defined experimental system that can be used to determine what happens when a TCR repertoire is selected to what would seem (from in vitro analysis) to be a suboptimal, cross-reactive mutant epitope. The interpretation of in vitro analysis alone should, however, be tempered with caution, as another mutant (M6A) that did not cross-react at all with the wt epitope elicited a completely novel, in vivo endogenous CTL response of equivalent magnitude when expressed in an infectious influenza A virus [22] . What would be the case for TCR responses elicited by influenza A viruses expressing the mutant NPN3A peptide in the native viral protein?",

The B6 mice were immunised i.p. with the virulent PR8 mutant and wt viruses, while the HK viruses were used for primary (1 o ) i.n. infection of na\u00efve mice or secondary (2 o ) i.n. challenge of PR8-immune (.30d previously) mice. Na\u00efve (primary) or PR8-immune (PR8, or PR8NPN3A) mice were challenged i.n. with the homologous virus (HK, or HKNPN3A) and CD8 + T cell responses were measured using the D b NP 366 and D b NPN3A tetramers (Fig 2) . It was immediately apparent that the splenic D b NPN3A + CD8 + set elicited by the HKNPN3A challenge was significantly smaller on d10 (p,0.05) than the D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cell response induced by the wt virus (Fig 2B) , though there was no significant difference between D b NPN3A + CD8 + and D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cell numbers at the site of infection (BAL, Fig 2A) . This has been seen before [24] and suggests that the need to clear virus from the lung results in preferential CTL localization to the site of infection when immune T cell numbers are limited. The profile of a diminished D b NPN3A + CD8 + T cell response was maintained into memory (d28, Fig 1C; p,0.02), supporting the view that the relative size of persistent T cell pools reflects the extent of antigen driven proliferation during the acute anti-viral response.",

Established T-cell immunity towards conserved viral regions provides some protection against influenza and promotes rapid recovery. However, influenza viruses mutate to escape the protective immunity. We found that established T cell immunity can recognise influenza mutants with variations at positions that are partially involved in T cell recognition. However, an initial priming with the mutated variant decreases recognition of the original parental virus. This finding results from a markedly lower functional quality and limited structural interactions of the mutant. In terms of possible vaccination strategies for rapidly changing viruses or tumours, it appears that priming with crossreactive mutants that display such characteristics would be of no benefit as the same level of T cell immunity against such mutants can be elicited by exposure to the original virus.",

Again, the results following secondary challenge support the view that, at least in the earlier (d28) stages of memory, T cell numbers reflect the extent of clonal expansion during the acute phase [26] . In our experiments, we detected D b NP 366 + CD8 + and NPN3A + CD8 + T cells by two techniques, tetramer staining and IFN-c ICS. Both techniques gave us comparable antigen-specific CD8 + T cell numbers, indicating that both tetramers accurately detected epitope-specific populations (Fig. 2GH) .",

More of the D b NPN3A + CD8 + T cells remained CD62L hi when sampled at the peak of the response (d10) following primary challenge (Fig S1A) , confirming the impression from the quantitative analysis (Fig 2 A-C) that there may be less clonal expansion. On the other hand, IL-7R expression was comparable for the D b NPN3A + CD8 + and D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cell populations generated in virus-infected na\u00efve mice (Fig S1 CD) with both being (p,0.01) lower than the values for the D b PA 224 -specific set ( Fig S1C) . This suggests that IL-7R levels may be antigen dose-rather than magnitude-dependent. Neither of these differential effects was apparent for d28 memory T cells specific for the mutant or wt epitopes (Fig S1BD) . Functional analysis of cytokine production based on short term (5h) stimulation with cognate peptide in the ICS assay showed no obvious differences at any stage for the D b NP 366 and D b NPN3Aspecifc T cells, though the usual divergence [29] from the D b PA 224 + CD8 + T cell response was observed (p,0.01) (Fig S1 E-H) . These data suggest that NPN3A mutation leads to crossreactive, but diminished, CD8 + T cell responses with comparable cytokine production profiles.",

The D b NPN3A crystal structure containing the heavy chain of H-2D b (residues 1-275), the b2 microglobulin (residues 1-99) and the 9 residues of the NPN3A peptide was determined to a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ), with a final R factor of 22.1% and an R free of 30.4%. The structure of the H-2D b -NPN3A complex was compared (Fig. 3B , Table 1 ) to the wt D b NP 366 [23] . As observed for the wt D b NP 366 , the mutant NPN3A peptide bound H-2D b in an extended conformation, the P2-Ser, P5-Asn and P9-Met represent the anchor residues, P3-Ala semi-anchor residue, whereas the P4-Glu, P6-Met, P7-Glu and P8-Thr are solvent exposed and available for contact by the TCR (Fig. 3AB) . However, the mutation of P3-Asn to Ala leads to a loss of 35 contacts between the peptide and the MHC molecule. In comparison to the wt NP 366 that makes 636 contacts with the H-2D b molecule, the NPN3A peptide achieves only 601 contacts. Interestingly, the Asn3 Ala mutation abolishes contacts between the P3 residue of the peptide with His155 and the Tyr156 of the MHC and eliminates one hydrogen bond between the P3-Asn Nd2 and the P4-Glu O (Fig. 3CD ). The loss of inter-residue bonding between 3N and 4E within the NPN3A peptide may also be important for TCR recognition as it changes the characteristics of the wt D b NP 366 epitope (defined as type III constraint) [30] into an unconstrained D b NPN3A epitope. This change of constraint within the epitope could affect the dynamics of the peptide upon TCR ligation, and subsequently alter TCR reactivity toward the mutated epitope. In addition, the loss of contacts with the His155 of the MHC is of interest, as position 155, termed the ''gate-keeper residue'' [31] is involved in contacting the TCRs in all TCRpMHC-I complexes solved to date [32] . Thus, the lack of interactions between the NPN3A peptide and the MHC through His155 may also affect recognition of the complex by D b NP 366specific TCRs.",

To test this hypothesis, we performed a thermostability assay on both NP 366 and NPN3A bound to the H-2D b molecule. The NP 366 and NPN3A peptides are equally effective at stabilising H-2D b . The pMHC-I complex with the NP 366 wt peptide had a Tm of 51.860.7uC and D b NPN3A showed a comparable level of thermostability (Tm = 51.461uC), irrespective of the concentrations of the complex used for the assay.

We found (Fig 4A) similar naive CTLp counts for D b NPN3A (34.6613.08) and D b NP 366 (28.5611.0), indicating that the smaller response to D b NPN3A + CD8 + is not due to reduced number of na\u00efve precursors. Furthermore, assessing the extent of Vb8.3 bias (the dominant Vb for the D b NP 366 + CD8 + set) within the na\u00efve D b NPN3A + CD8 + population ( Fig 4B) showed that the extent of Vb8.3 usage (mean 13.2%64.3) (Fig. 4B ) was much the same as that determined previously [33] for na\u00efve D b NP 366 + CD8 + CTLps (mean 17.1%67.4) However, sequencing the na\u00efve D b NPN3A + Vb8.3 + CD8 + TCR CDR3b regions showed a clear difference from the comparable wt-specific set. The ''public TCR'' dominance characteristic of D b NP 366 + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cells in both pre-immune [33] and immune [34] TCRb repertoires [34] was not a prominent feature of the D b NPN3A-specific TCR repertoire. These public TCRs were found in only one (SGGANTGQL and SGGGNTGQL) or two (SGGSNTGQL) of the 10 mice tested (Fig. 4C) . Thus, although the na\u00efve CTLp frequencies are comparable for D b NP 366 + Vb8.3 + CD8 + and D b NPN3A + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cells and there is some overlap of some cross-reactive TCRs, the two repertoires are far from identical. The roughly equivalent numbers of precursors specific for the wt D b NP 366 and mutant NPN3A peptides were unexpected considering the lower response after infection with the mutated virus. The lower magnitude of the NPN3A + CD8 + T cell response and narrower TCRb repertoire suggest that only a proportion of na\u00efve NPN3A + CD8 + precursors are being recruited into the immune response or that, once recruited, these cells do not expand efficiently. Inefficient recruitment and/or expansion early after influenza infection, despite large na\u00efve CTL precursor numbers, have been recently documented by our group as key determinants of subdominance for D b PB1-F2 62 and K b NS2 114 -specific responses [33] .",

Overall, the mutant and the wt immune Vb8.3 repertoires appear different. Single-cell RT-PCR and sequencing of the CDR3b region of tetramer + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cells following either HK or HK-NPN3A infections showed that (Table S1) 2), and showed evidence of more variable CDR3b loop lengths (8-9 aa). The reduction (relative to the wt D b NP 366 ) in Vb8.3 usage by the D b NPN3A + CD8 + T cells reproduces the relative loss of ''public'' wt TCRs found for the na\u00efve repertoire ( Fig 4B) . This likely reflects that the N3A mutation has disrupted an ''optimal'' TCR/ pMHC fit that maximizes antigen-driven clonal expansion. Indeed, the public TCRs were not a prominent feature of the D b NPN3A + CD8 + set, being found in only 4 of the 7 NPN3Ainfected mice at a very low frequency, namely 0% in the 1 0 response and 22.9% in the 2 0 response ( Table 2 ).

Even so, the clonotypic diversity within individual NPN3A virus-infected mice was reduced compared to the spectrum found following wt virus-infection. This was true whether the cells were sorted using the wt D b NP 366 or the mutant D b NPN3A tetramer, reflecting the significant cross-reactivity between the D b NP 366 and D b NPN3A-specific populations recovered from mice infected with the NPN3A viruses. By the measure of tetramer binding, it thus seems that the NPN3A virus is selecting a less diverse repertoire than the wt virus, with the repertoire being almost completely cross-reactive with that elicited by the wt D b NP 366 epitope.",

However, a switch in frequency was seen for some CDR3b-defined clonotypes, indicating selective binding of particular TCRs by the D b NPN3A tetramer. For example in M9 and M10 (Table 3) the 'public' SGGANTGQL CDR3b-sequence dominated the D b NP 366 + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cell population, whereas this sequence was less commonly detected in the same mice by the D b NPN3A tetramer. The difference could, of course, reflect diversity in TCRa usage. Following clonotype selection with the D b NP 366 and D b NPN3A tetramers, sequencing of the secondary TCRb repertoire (M11-M13) induced by challenge with the homologous (PR8, then HK) viruses showed less divergence within the wt D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cell specific population. Interestingly, clonotypes like KGGS-NTGQL were enriched by the D b NPN3A tetramer in some but not other mice (Table 3 ; present in M9 but not M12) suggesting, again, the likely importance of Vb-Va chain pairing for recognition of the native D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cells with the mutant D b NPN3A tetramer. Thus, the analysis suggests that only a subset of the repertoire generated by wt infection is able to recognize the D b NPN3A epitope, though this population is more diverse than that generated in response to the mutant NPN3A virus.

Mice that were primed with the PR8NPN3A and then challenged with either the wt HK or mutant HKNPN3A viruses showed equivalent recall of D b NPN3A + CD8 + T cells during the acute phase of the secondary response. This was detected by IFN-c production ( Fig 5A) and tetramer staining (data not shown) and is consistent with the TCR CDR3b analysis (Table 2) . Conversely, when mice were firstly primed with wt PR8, then later infected i.n. with either the wt HK or mutant HK-NPN3A, the D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cells were differentially recalled indicating that (in the absence of primary selection from the na\u00efve repertoire by the mutant epitope) only some of the D b NP 366 + CD8 + memory T cells that were expanded by heterologous challenge bind D b NPN3A (Fig. 5A) . Interestingly, wt priming and challenge (1 0 PR8-.2 0 X31) resulted in significantly higher CD8 + T cells numbers (Fig. 5B ) than were found for any secondary CD8 + T cell responses after NPN3A priming (1 0 PR8-NPN3A-.2 0 X31-NPN3A and 1 0 PR8-NPN3A-.2 0 X31). These results lead to two main conclusions: (i) priming with the wt virus elicits CD8 + T cells that respond relatively well to a subsequent infection with cross-reactive variant (ie 1 0 PR8-.2 0 X31-NPN3A = 1 0 PR8-NPN3A-.2 0 X31-NPN3A); (ii) priming with the cross-reactive variant can be detrimental as the diminished primary response may limit the full expansion of CD8 + T cells that are able to respond to the subsequent wt infection (ie 1 0 PR8-NPN3A-.2 0 X31 is lower than 1 0 PR8-.2 0 X31) and skew the TCR usage. Thus, using NPN3A for either priming or the challenge gives an equally poor response.",

We performed prime-andchallenge studies in mMT mice lacking B cells to ensure that antibody responses did not mask any possible inhibitory effects of ''suboptimal'' TCRs on viral clearance. As suggested by CD8 + T cell data, assessment of lung viral titres showed delayed viral clearance on d6 after the secondary infection in case of heterologous prime-and-boost (PR8-.X31-NPN3A and PR8-NPN3A-.X31) compared to homologous infections (PR8-.X31 or PR8-NPN3A-.X31-NPN3A) (Fig. 5B) . These results indicate that recall of ''suboptimal'' TCRs for a single T cell specificity can lead to delayed viral clearance, despite the presence of other influenza CD8 + T cell responses (D b PA 224 These patterns of complete, or partial, cross-stimulation following in vivo virus challenge were reflected in the results found for in vitro measurements of ''functional avidity'' (Fig 6) . Pulsing immune spleen cells recovered directly ex vivo with graded doses of wt or mutant peptide in the ICS assay showed comparable levels of IFN-c induction (Fig 6AC) in every situation but one, the exposure of wt-primed T cells to the NPN3A peptide ( Fig 6B) . Thus, while the immune repertoire selected by D b NP3A shows evidence of equivalent avidity following stimulation with the NPN3A or NP 366 peptides, D b NP 366 induces a response that is of higher avidity for the wt than the mutant epitope. The same effect was seen even more clearly when three (all expressing the SGGGNTGQL CDR3b) T cell hybridoma lines [37] specific for D b NP 366 were stimulated with the two peptides ( Fig 6DE) . This result is in accord with findings from both the TCR repertoire analysis of crossreactive clonotypes, assessed by tetramer binding (Table 2) , and the response magnitudes determined following homologous and heterologous virus challenge (Fig 5) . Thus, priming and recall of cross-reactive CD8 + T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes reflects functional (defined as responsiveness to a peptide) pMHC-TCR avidity.",

While tetramer dissociation assay measured the ''off-rate'' component of pMHC-I avidity, tetramer dilution technique assessed the overall pMHC-I avidity (both the ''on'' and ''off'' rates).

The NPN3A mutation leads to both decreased recruitment of CD8 + T cells and a narrowed clonotype selection profile within Vb8.3 and Vb9 regions. Structurally, the mutation leads to a loss of a number of contacts between the NPN3A peptide and the MHC-I molecule, including a contact with the gate-keeper residue at position 155, and unaltered stability of the H-2D b -NPN3A complex. The fact that the NPN3A mutation affects contacts with the MHC-I at His155, known to play an important role in TCR-pMHC structures in general, is likely to indirectly compromise the TCR recognition. By loosing the bond with the Asn3, His155 may gain more flexibility and thus be inappropriately placed for the subsequent TCR ligation onto the NPN3A peptide. Alternatively, it is also possible that a small part of the solvent-exposed head group of the Asn3 residue in the wt NP 366 peptide might, to some extent, be directly interacting with the TCR following ligation. Surprisingly, despite the loss of several contacts between NPN3A peptide and H-2D b , the stability of the peptide-MHC-I complex remains constant for both NP 366 and NPN3A. This suggests that the Asn3 as a secondary anchor does not play an important role in stabilizing the peptide within the MHC-I. The structural basis for the diminished recruitment of D b NPN3Aspecific CD8 + T cells is thus likely to rest in the way that the partially-solvent exposed residue contacts MHC-I and modifies TCR ligation.",

These findings suggest that a very limited spectrum of CD8 + T cells can recognise the D b NPN3A mutant structure. Interestingly, a similar P3 substitution in the influenza virus D b PA 224 epitope had no affect on D b PA 224 + CD8 + T cell recognition and recruited a diverse array of TCR clones comparable to the spectrum found for the wt response [21] . This suggests that the partially-exposed P3 residue plays a greater structural and/or TCR recognition role for the ''featureless'' D b NP 366 than for the ''featured'' D b PA 224 complex reflecting, in turn, the more limited spectrum of TCRs that bind D b NP 366 [21] . Taken together, it appears that partially-exposed residues within viral peptides can provide important contacts with the MHC-I, which can in turn cause remote effects that modify antigenicity for the TCR-pMHC-I complex and impact on both TCR repertoire selection and the magnitude of CD8 + T cell responses.",

            "text": "The TCR repertoires specific for D b NP 366 and D b NPN3A appear to be quite distinct. The response overall for wt D b NP 366 + CD8 + T cells is characterised by conserved, ''public'' clonotypes that constitute the majority (83.5% in 1 0 response and 92.3% in 2 0 response) of the selected TCR repertoire [34] . These public clonotypes are not a prominent feature of the D b NPN3A + CD8 + set, being found only in 4/7 NPN3A-infected mice at very low frequency. Since we know that these TCR clonotypes are present in all B6 mice [34] , the difference presumably reflects the lower TCR avidity for D b NPN3A, as indicated by the T cell hybridoma analysis where they were shown to require 1000 times more NPN3A than NP 366 peptide for optimal stimulation. Since the public clonotypes cannot be efficiently recruited into the immune response by the mutated N3A virus, this could have created a ''hole'' in TCRs capable of recognising the mutated epitope, which subsequently can lead to a reduction in T cell immunogenicity [43] . However, though both the D b NP 366 + CD8 + and D b NPN3A + CD8 + T cell responses are characterised by quite distinct TCR repertoires, the majority are bound by both the D b NP 366 and D b NPN3A tetramers and can be detected by stimulation with either the NP 366 or the NPN3A peptides, suggesting that a clonal dissection of TCR clonotypes is needed to make a valid interpretation about the truly crossreactive CD8 + T cell responses. These findings also raise questions concerning the true correlation between pHMC-I tetramer binding in vitro and the in vivo selection of a responding TCR repertoire.",

Conversely, the ''better'' fit D b NP 366 finds a sufficient spectrum of high avidity TCRs within that available naive repertoire and does not (likely because of clonal competition) select most of the TCR ab pairs that interact optimally with D b NPN3A. Priming with the wt virus thus establishes memory for only a very limited secondary response to the mutant. Similar to our results, subtle variations within the anchor residue of H b peptide/I-E k also decreased peptide-MHC class II affinity and the activation of responding T cells [44] .",

Briefly, processed lymph nodes and spleen samples were resuspended in 100 ml of Sorter buffer, 100 ml FcR block (24G2 and CD16 culture supernatant, 1% mouse and 1% rat serum) was added, and clumps of dead cells were discarded. Tetramers at optimal staining concentrations (D b N3A 366 -PE at 40mg/ml and D b NP 366 -PE at 10mg/ml) were added to the cell mix and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in 400 ml buffer with 100 ml anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), and incubated at 4uC for 25 mins. Following two washes, cells were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer and cells that had bound the microbeads were purified on a magnetic LS column according to manufacturers instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells eluted from the column were centrifuged (5156g, 6 min, 4uC), supernatant carefully aspirated to leave 90 ml buffer remaining, and 10 ml antibody cocktail was added for 30 min at 4uC. The antibody cocktail contained anti-CD8-APC Cy7 (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD4-PE Cy7 (eBiosciences), anti-B220-FITC (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD11b-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD11c-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-F4/80-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD62L-APC (Pharmingen, BD), and anti-CD3-PerCP Cy5.5 (Pharmingen, BD) mAbs. Cells were washed in 2 ml buffer, centrifuged (5156g, 6 min, 4uC), and supernatant aspirated leaving 100 ml. Resuspended cells were passed through 45 mm sieve, and data acquired by flow cytometry on the LSR II (Becton Dickinson) and analysed with FlowJo (Treestar Inc.) software. In selected experiments, na\u00efve NPN3A + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cells were single-cell sorted for TCRb analysis. Experimental details of the single cell RT-PCR designed to amplify naive NPN3A + Vb8.3 + CD8 + T cells using 2 different sorting strategies are listed in Table S3 .",

The search probe used to solve the structure was the structure of mouse MHC class I H2-D b minus the peptide (Protein Data Bank accession number 3CPL) [22] . The progress of refinement was monitored by the R free value with neither a sigma nor a low-resolution cutoff being applied to the data.
