            "text": "Six volunteers experienced severe inflammatory response during the Phase I clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody that was designed to stimulate a regulatory T cell response. Soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a ''cytokine storm'', a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. The monoclonal antibody, TGN1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines to very hich values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. Because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. Here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. A general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. The eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. It suggests that perturbations in IL2, IL8, and IL10 have the most significant inductive effect, while IFN-c and IL12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. Although TNF-a is a major pro-inflammatory factor, IFN-c and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to TGN1412 infusion. Principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: [TNF-a, IL1, IL10], IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-a have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. This study illuminates details of a cytokine storm event, and it demonstrates the value of linear modeling for interpreting complex, coupled biological system dynamics from empirical data.",

They either enhance or inhibit inflammation in response to pathogens, ''non-self'' molecules, and toxins. Cytokines allow context-dependent communication within the body [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . If the interactions that lead to cytokine production are destabilized, a \"cytokine storm\" (or hypercytokinemia) can result, producing unbridled inflammation within tissues and key organs. Cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock [6] , influenza, acute respiratory distress [7] , host response to blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation, and toxic response to medication. They have been implicated in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the H5N1 avian influenza infections first recognized in 1987 [8, 9] .",

TGN1412 is a genetically engineered CD28 antibody agonist that can activate T cells without a co-stimulatory antigen signal [12, 11] . The drug's manufacturer saw a potential application in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whose T-cell population had been destroyed by chemotherapy along with the cancerous B cells. They also saw potential applications in boosting regulatory T cells to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where effector T cells become overactive and pathogenic [12] .",

            "text": "With efficacy demonstrated in animal models, Phase I clinical trials were scheduled for testing in humans. In March 2006, six healthy male volunteers received TGN1412, and two volunteers received a placebo. Great care was taken in establishing a dosage that was deemed to be safe in humans [12] . Within an hour of infusion, the six who received the drug experienced adverse effects while those who received placebo did not. The drug's recipients had headaches, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, decreased blood pressure, and increased heart rate, all indications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [13, 11] . Severe depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred four hours after drug infusion and continued until the fourth day. C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and neutrophil concentrations increased well above normal levels during the same time period. Eventually, all six patients experienced multi-organ failure, with infiltrates in the lung, intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and lung injury [11] . Critical care and subsequent treatment included dialysis, mechanical ventilation, and, in one case, surgery to counter peripheral ischemia [11, 14] . The periods of illness extended beyond one month and may have induced permanent damage for all patients. Biological explanations of the event are offered in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] . Infection, underlying disease, or endotoxins did not cause this unique event; hence, it allowed unusual insight into the course and impact of immune-mediated cytokine storms. The analysis presented here particularly focused on timedependent coupled interactions among the nine cytokines measured. The ability of the model to capture dynamics suggests that the nonlinearities and complexities of cytokine storms may not prove an insurmountable problem for mathematical biologists.",

Here, we present linear, time-invariant models whose parameters are estimated from the median time series data for the six TGN1412 clinical subjects [11] . The models describe the evolution of nine cytokine concentrations without regard to the cells that secrete or are affected by them; cellular sources and sinks reported in the literature are discussed in a later section. Separate second-order equations for the concentrations and rates-of-change of each cytokine are constructed, and best-fit time constants are found by numerical search. All nine cytokines are then analyzed concurrently in an eighteenth-order system. A unified search over all of the higher-order system's parameters improves the fit to the measured variables and provides an integrated model of the cytokine storm event. The coupled model illustrates multi-class interactions among the cytokines, identifies response modes and mode shapes (i.e., eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and reveals similarities in principal components. The data set, differential-and difference-equation models, and numerical search algorithm are described. The effects of uncertainty in initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates are evaluated using a stochastic extension of the linear model.",

Signal saturation limits for the cytometric bead array immunoassays were 5,000 pg/mL; thus, higher cytokine values could not be detected.

To assure that the minimization defines a coupled stability matrix, A C , in the neighborhood of A UC , we assign a small penalty to the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal parameters. This procedure is called regularization, and it is widely used in statistics and machine learning. Denoting the coupling parameters by the (7261) vector, p C , a soft constraint weighted by r C is added to the error cost:",

We examine missing cytokines in two sets: pro-inflammatory and anti2/mixedinflammatory cytokines. Figure 10 shows that eliminating TNF-a has a weak effect on IL12, but little effect on other cytokines. The result suggests that TNF-a concentration is not a driving factor on the dynamics of the cytokine network. This is not surprising, given the variable role of TNF-a in immune cell biology [29] .

Assuming that the clinical infusion lasts for 4 min and occurs at 2 mg/min or 2880 mg/day, B = (2880/8)x(0) = 360x(0). Maintaining a fixed dose of 8 mg, the TGN1412 infusion rate is inversely proportional to the infusion duration, t infusion . We see the results of increasing the infusion duration from 4 minutes to 3 days in Fig. 12 , with pharmacokinetic effects neglected. The 4-min-infusion simulation is virtually identical to the results for instantaneous infusion. There is little change in profile for durations lasting several hours (not shown). For a one-day infusion duration at a rate of 0.0056 mg/ min, several cytokine peaks remain close to their recorded values. Significant reduction in peak values requires infusion periods of 2-3 days, for which infusion rates are 1/720-1/960 of the trial values. However, stretching the infusion period prolongs the period when cytokine concentrations remain at unacceptably high levels.

Thus, it is not surprising that clinical signs included headaches, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, vasodilation, and hypotension. When recruited, immune cells secrete cytokines, and cytokines regulate cellular activity; thus, it is of interest to examine possible underlying cellular relationships from the cytokine profiles. Additional laboratory results shown in [11] can be compared to the principal components of cytokine response. Cytokine Group B [IFN-c, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12] had the fastest response to TGN1412 (Fig. 9 ), peaking about six hours after TGN infusion. It was during this time that T cell, monocyte, and platelet concentrations crashed. While cytokine production depends on the concentration of cells that secrete them as well as per-cell secretion rates, a sudden burst of cytokine production by activated cells could lead to their apoptotic death and to reduced cell populations.

These drugs -corticosteroids, chlorpheniramine, acetaminophen, ondansetron, metaraminol, methylprednisolene, and the anti-IL2 receptor antagonist antibody -could be administered safely to healthy subjects at low dosages for short periods of time. Cytokine concentrations would be measured at regular intervals, and the analysis presented in this paper could be applied to the data. Ancillary data, including clinical metrics, could be collected in the process. Unlike pharmacologic clinical trials focused on the safety or efficacy of new drugs, the empirical trials would be directed at gaining new knowledge about fundamental biology. Cross comparisons would allow the cytokine coupling effects to be distinguished from the direct effects of the drug stimuli, in a secure, well-controlled environment. This approach could lead the way toward developing a strong theoretical basis not only for understanding cytokine storms but for explaining many aspects of human physiology.",

Each cytokine's response is assumed to be proportional to its current concentration and its current rate of change; thus, its response is represented by a second-order differential equation. Nine interacting cytokines are, therefore, represented by an eighteenth-order system. Coefficients of the model are found by minimizing an error cost function using the downhill-simplex method. The system model provides evidence for the regulation of cytokines by other cytokines, identifying inductive and inhibitive relationships among the nine cytokines as well as similarities in temporal histories.",

This effect would not be beneficial, as the period during which cytokines were at unacceptably high levels also would increase. This suggests that the drug, not the dose used during the trial, was the crux of the problem. Analysis of the data's principal components reveals that cytokine response profiles fall into three groups: [TNF-a, IL1, and IL10], [IFN-c, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. Association of these cytokines with cellular secretion and regulation suggest that the adaptive immune system had a dominant effect in the cytokine storm (perhaps unsurprising, given the source of the stimulus). As suggested by the literature review, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL8, was most likely produced by innate system cells and nonimmune tissue.",

It is envisioned that extensions of this analysis to empirical biological trials using safe pharmaceutical agents to stimulate dynamic response could establish new paradigms in the mathematical theory of biology.
