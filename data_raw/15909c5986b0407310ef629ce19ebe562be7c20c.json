As we have evidence of chloride-ion dependent innate antiviral response in epithelial cells, we conducted a pilot, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HsNIG) vs standard care on healthy adults within 48 hours of URTI onset to assess recruitment (primary outcome). Acceptability, symptom duration and viral shedding were secondary outcomes. participants maintained a symptom diary until well for two days or a maximum of 14 days and collected 5 sequential mid-turbinate swabs to measure viral shedding. the intervention arm prepared hypertonic saline and performed HsNIG. We recruited 68 participants (2.6 participants/week; November 2014-March 2015). A participant declined after randomisation. Another was on antibiotics and hence removed (Intervention:32, Control:34). Follow up data was available from 61 (Intervention:30, Control:31). 87% found HSNIG acceptable, 93% thought HSNIG made a difference to their symptoms. In the intervention arm, duration of illness was lower by 1.9 days (p = 0.01), over-the-counter medications (OTCM) use by 36% (p = 0.004), transmission within household contacts by 35% (p = 0.006) and viral shedding by \u22650.5 log 10 /day (p = 0.04). We hence need a larger trial to confirm our findings.",

Hence, specific antiviral treatment is impractical, and we need an intervention effective against multiple viruses.

A significant reduction in sore throats and colds was reported when Australian wood-workers performed Jalaneti for a year 9 . Three randomised controlled trials (RCT) report the efficacy of salt water for acute URTI. Adam et al. reported the lack of improvement in symptoms or duration of illness in adults with a common cold or bacterial rhinosinusitis [hypertonic saline (HS)/normal saline (NS) sprays thrice/day vs. standard care]. However, individuals with a common cold who received HS sprays said they would use it again (p = 0.007) 10 . Sea-water sprays (six-times/day) significantly reduced sore throat, nasal secretions, decongestant/mucolytic use in children with URTI 11 concludes that the evidence is very limited 12 . In a recent report, both NS and sea-water drops (thrice/day) reduced the severity of URTI symptoms in young children 13 .",

We have recently reported laboratory evidence that non-myeloid cells (e.g. epithelial, fibroblast and hepatic cells) have an innate immune mechanism, which is augmented in the presence of salt (NaCl) 15 . In cell culture models, DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are all inhibited in the presence of NaCl 15 . The antiviral effect is dependent on the availability of chloride ions (and not sodium ions) 15 . In the presence viral infection and the availability of NaCl, cells utilise the chloride ions to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl) 15 . Since HOCl is the active ingredient in bleach, which is known to have an antiviral effect, the mechanism could be augmented by supplying chloride ions through NaCl to treat infections. Here, we report the results of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS), a pilot RCT of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) versus standard care in adults with URTI to determine if we can recruit and retain participants in Edinburgh and to get initial information on acceptability, duration of symptoms, and viral shedding.",

HSNIG reduced the duration of illness (22%), OTCM use (36%) and illness in household members (35%). When individuals infected with similar viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus and influenza virus) were compared, 30% more individuals had reduction in viral shedding by \u22650.5 log 10 per day in the intervention arm. This could explain both the reduction in the duration of illness and transmission to household contacts in the intervention arm. However, though the difference between the baseline and end-point samples was larger in the intervention arm than the control arm, the difference was not significant (although this study was not powered to detect differences in these measures). In participants who stopped HSNIG before day four, 54% (7/13) had an increase in viral shedding. There was also an increase/stabilisation of symptoms in 50% (8/16) before symptoms resolved. In fact, four individuals felt the need to restart HSNIG for one or more days (Fig. 4) . These finding along with the lower rate of symptomatic household contacts in the intervention arm suggest that HSNIG helps reduce viral replication. Since viruses are shed during breathing and speaking 7 , measure that helps reduce viral shedding would help reduce transmission.",

We hence need a larger trial to confirm our findings. The lack of a placebo group is another limitation. Since our hypothesis was that the chloride ion has an antiviral effect, we were unable to use NS as a control as it could cause a reduction in symptoms. This is supported by results from earlier studies. For e.g. in a cross over trial (10 weeks twice daily nasal spray and 10 weeks without sprays with a Intervention (n = 32) n (%) Control (n = 34) n (%) two-week washout period), twice a day saline sprays significantly reduced nasal symptoms in military recruits compared to those with no intervention (p = 0.027). The number of episodes of URTI was lower in the period when saline sprays were used compared to the period when sprays were not used. However, the difference was just short of significance (p = 0.05) 25 . Our rationale also seems vindicated by a recent report suggesting that both sea water drops and saline drops were equally effective in treating children <2 years of age with URTI compared to symptomatic controls 13 . Sodium bicarbonate, though commonly used, is uncomfortable in the author's personal experience. Recent evidence suggests that sodium ion also has an antimicrobial effect 26, 27 . Hence, until a safe and comfortable placebo that contain neither chloride, halide or sodium ion is identified, placebo-controlled trials cannot be done. Another aspect that needs to be considered is the potential benefits of the simple process of flushing in the intervention arm. Even in the presence of a placebo arm, this cannot be answered. Further studies with different methodologies for supplying NaCl (e.g. hypertonic saline sprays, or aerosolised NaCl) may help answer this question.",

There were more individuals without a detectable virus in the baseline sample in the control arm (12/34:35%) compared to the intervention arm (5/32:16%). This difference did not however reach statistical significance (p = 0.059) (Table S1 ). Though allergic rhinitis (history of allergy with current eye/nose itching or sneezing) was an exclusion criterion, it is possible that some of these individuals could have allergic rhinitis. Or, the infective aetiology might not have been detected in the nose swab. For e.g. sore throat was often recorded by those who did not have a detectable virus. As we collected a nose swab, it is possible that the aetiology could be picked up by including a throat swab along with a nose swab. Viral shedding is difficult to quantify due to the variability in sampling and as most routine respiratory PCR's are qualitative assays. We used self-collected mid-turbinate swabs (Copan, Italy) both for participants convenience (no gag reflex) and as the swabs are designed with a stop which increases safety and should help reduce variation in sampling 28 . Since nasal irrigation could physically wash off the virus, we collected swabs first thing in the morning before HSNIG. We used eNAT, a transport medium that inactivates viruses and in which samples are stable at room temperature for at least two weeks. In our hands, samples in eNAT were stable for at least a week at room temperature and could be posted back to the laboratory for testing 29 . Where we identified a virus in the baseline sample, we tested all five samples in the same run to minimise inter-assay variability. To compare viral shedding, we converted CT values to log 10 values. The baseline samples were hence tested on two occasions. The inter-assay variation between the two results was very low [mean (SD): 0.21 log 10 (1.17)]. The cut-off of \u22650.5 log 10 per day used to determine reduction in viral shedding is more than double that of the inter-assay variation seen and hence is unlikely to be an artefact of the testing process. All these measures together have helped produce viral shedding data that could be compared between arms. In four individuals with a positive baseline sample, follow-up samples were negative. In two individuals a sample with a low CT (i.e. high viral copy) were followed by samples with undetectable virus. Since our consent did not include human DNA testing, we could not test for housekeeping genes and cannot be certain if these samples were properly collected. This need to be addressed in future studies.",

The results of ELVIS are significantly different to that from Adam et al. which had many methodological issues. They compared 2% HS spray, NS spray (two squirts, thrice a day) and a control group in individuals with the common cold or rhinosinusitis 10 . Though sample size was similar to ELVIS (35-43/arm), individuals were recruited up to 3 weeks after illness onset. Very few had the common cold (12-17/arm), most had bacterial rhinosinusitis and 98% of them were treated with antibiotics. Despite these shortcomings, individuals with the common cold who received HS sprays said they would use it again (p = 0.007). To avoid these shortcomings, we selected only those with a common cold within 48 hours of onset, and who were not on antibiotic therapy.",

Sea water sprays thrice a day, for 12 weeks in children significantly reduced reported illness, school absence and use of medication 11 .

Participants were also trained to collect the nose swab by the trial nurse. Hence a pragmatic approach (i.e. patient reported compliance) can be taken to reduce the burden to the participant and the cost of the study. However, in patient groups where compliance might be an issue, compliance could be improved by using video monitoring of the procedures (HSNIG and collecting nasal swabs) via smart phones with support from the clinical team similar to the approach used for tuberculosis treatment 34, 35 . The amount of salt used could also be measured at the end of the study. Tests for human DNA could be done to determine if swabs were actually collected before being introduced into the transport medium. Online data entry could be encouraged which would help reduce missing/incorrect data. Reminder messages (by text or email) could be sent to prompt regular data entry and return of samples. However, these decisions would need to be taken considering the population, the burden to the participant and the cost involved.",

With the two groups combined [i.e. a sample size of 54] we would be able to express a proportion to within \u00b113%.

The short form of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21) was used to collect daily symptom data 33 . For use in the Scottish context, and with the authors consent, the words \"sick\" and \"plugged\" were replaced with \"unwell\" and \"blocked\", respectively (WURSS-21-Scot) (Fig. S1 ). Participants were asked to answer the global severity question: \"How unwell do you feel today?\" which was scored from 0 (not unwell) to 7 (severely unwell). If they scored >0, then symptoms and functional ability were graded 0-7. They then answered the global change question \"Compared to yesterday, I feel my cold is\" which was scored from 0 (very much better) to 6 (very much worse). Total WURSS-21 score was calculated by adding the scores for all except the first and last question. To calculate the mean WURSS-21 score, the scores for each participant were added and divided by 14. A mean value of EQ-VAS was calculated for each participant over the time questionnaires were returned as it was possible that participants may not score 100 even when a person's cold symptoms have completely resolved. Both arms documented OTCM use and if they contacted the general practitioner (GP)/nurse for further management of their URTI. Feedback about trial procedures, acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study and information on symptomatic household contacts were collected at the end of the study.

As the hypothesis was chloride ion mediated antiviral effect, normal saline could not be used as a placebo. As sodium bicarbonate was uncomfortable in the authors personal experience, we opted for not including a placebo arm. The rationale for not including a saline placebo arm is elaborated in the discussion. Participants documented OTCM use and were asked to contact to their GP if unwell.

CT values were converted to log 10 using this formula (40-CT of sample)/3.3 (a CT of 3.3 represents a log change in viral load by PCR). Since the baseline sample was tested on two separate occasions, reproducibility of testing was assessed by comparing the two results. Inter-assay variation was expected to be <0.5 log 10 . Where consecutive samples had undetectable virus, the first sample that was undetectable was treated as the end-point for viral shedding analysis. For the intervention arm, since NaCl could have an antiviral effect, the day with the lowest shedding when HSNIG was being performed was treated as the end-point. Where HSNIG was stopped earlier than 4 days, since swabs were collected first thing in the morning, the day after HSNIG was stopped was considered the end-point. Hence for the intervention arm, the end-point was day 4 [apart from participant numbers 1, 5, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 where it was day 3; 2 (rhinovirus), 14, and 15 where it was day 2; and 11 and 12 where it was day 1].
