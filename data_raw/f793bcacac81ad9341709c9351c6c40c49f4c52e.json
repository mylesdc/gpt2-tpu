However, the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins engaged in the CSFV replication are poorly defined. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified to be an NS5A-binding partner. The NS5A-eEF1A interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays. The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction. Overexpression of eEF1A suppressed the CSFV growth markedly, and conversely, knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the CSFV replication significantly. Furthermore, eEF1A, as well as NS5A, was found to reduce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of CSFV in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay. Streptavidin pulldown assay revealed that eEF1A could bind to the CSFV IRES. Collectively, our results suggest that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.",

CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 12.3 kb. The RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein, flanked by a 5 1 -untranslated region (UTR) and a 3 1 -UTR. Under cellular and viral protease processing, the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins, including four structural proteins (C, E rns , E1 and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (N pro , p7, NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [1] [2] [3] . The 5 1 -UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is responsible for translation initiation of the viral genome [4] . The 3 1 -UTR is in charge of regulating the pestiviral genome replication [5, 6] .",

The conserved sequence C2717-C2740-C2742-C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [7] . It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B (viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] ) and 3 1 -UTR [8] . The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of the family Flaviviridae, is an essential component of the replication complex [9] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [10, 11] . The HCV NS5A-Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [12] . The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [13, 14] . In addition, the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner and the key sites (K399, T401, E406 and L413) are also found in BVDV, BDV and HCV [15] . To date, studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [8, 15] , but knowledge of NS5A-interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited.",

For TBSV, eEF1A facilitates the assembly of the TBSV replicase and stimulates minus-strand synthesis [21] . The HIV-1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages through the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of eEF1A and tRNAs. Moreover, eEF1 complex subunits are critical HIV-1 reverse transcription cofactors [22, 23] . In addition, the BVDV NS5A was also shown to interact with eEF1A [24] . Considering CSFV, BVDV, HCV and WNV are all Flaviviridae members, we suppose that the CSFV NS5A protein possibly interacts with eEF1A or affects the CSFV growth in host cells. In this study, we identified the host protein eEF1A as a novel NS5A-interacting partner that negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.",

To confirm the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay was performed with the GST-tagged NS5A protein expressed in Escherichia coli and the Myc-tagged eEF1A protein expressed in HEK293T cells. The results showed that GST-NS5A but not GST interacts with eEF1A ( Figure 1B ). To further verify the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing 3\u02c6Flag-tagged NS5A and Myc-tagged eEF1A. After incubation with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (MAb) and Protein G-Agarose, the Myc-tagged eEF1A was found to coprecipitate with the 3\u02c6Flag-tagged NS5A ( Figure 1C) . Furthermore, the 3\u02c6Flag-tagged NS5A was shown to coprecipitate with Myc-eEF1A when the cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc MAb and Protein G-Agarose ( Figure 1D ). Considering that both eEF1A and NS5A show a strong affinity for nucleic acids, we investigated whether the NS5A-eEF1A interaction might be mediated through a nonspecific RNA bridge. The results showed that the NS5A-eEF1A interaction was not influenced by RNase treatment, indicating that the interaction is not due to nonspecific RNA-mediated binding ( Figure 1E ). To examine the colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A, the subcellular localization of 3\u02c6Flag-NS5A and Myc-eEF1A was examined by confocal microscopy. Both 3\u02c6Flag-NS5A and Myc-eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1F ). Taken together, the results demonstrated that eEF1A is an interacting partner of the CSFV NS5A protein.",

Twenty-four hours after lentivirus-mediated shRNAs transduction, PK-15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0.1. The viral replication was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, virus titration and Western blotting. In comparison with the shNC control, the viral genome copies in the eEF1A-knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, the CSFV titers were significantly increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK-15 cells ( Figure 4B ), and the N pro protein expression in the sheEF1A-transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ).

A previous study showed that the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis, and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription, protein degradation, protein folding and metabolism [26] . Recently, heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [27] . In this study, eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study, probably due to the different cell types (endothelial cells vs. primary macrophages) used to construct the cDNA library [26] . We showed that NS5A and eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm. As NS5A is the component of the replication complex, whether eEF1A is also localized in the replication complex needs further investigation.",

The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [28] . eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and regulates the virus replication [29] . Furthermore, eEF1A can be utilized as the cofactors of the viral RNA synthesis for several viruses, such as HIV-1 [22, 23] , TBSV [21] and WNV [30] . Previous studies on turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and TBSV have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex, and thus acts as a chaperone and supports viral replication [31] [32] [33] . As members of Flaviviridae, both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [24, 34] . Thereinto, the exact role of eEF1A on the BVDV replication remains unclear [24] . The HCV NS4A inhibits the viral IRES-mediated translation, and the translation inhibitory effect of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in the in vitro translation system [34] . However, we showed here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth. We conclude that the different roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct interactions between eEF1A and different viruses. In this study, the eEF1A was shown to bind to the IRES and inhibit its activity, thus it is possible to suppress the CSFV replication.",

It has been shown that interaction between eEF1A and the 3 1 -terminal stem-loop of the WNV genomic RNA facilitates the viral minus-strand RNA synthesis [30, 36, 37] . In the present study, we demonstrated that eEF1A binds to IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR of CSFV. Whether eEF1A binds to 3 1 -UTR of CSFV and influences RNA replication requires further study. We showed that eEF1A inhibits CSFV growth and reduces IRES activity of CSFV. Thus, we speculate that eEF1A affects the process of the viral protein translation via interacting with the CSFV IRES.",
