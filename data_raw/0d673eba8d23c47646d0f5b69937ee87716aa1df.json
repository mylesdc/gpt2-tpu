            "text": "Bats constitute a reservoir of zoonotic infections and some bat paramyxoviruses are capable of cross-species transmission, often with fatal consequences. Determining the level of viral diversity in reservoir populations is fundamental to understanding and predicting viral emergence. This is particularly relevant for RNA viruses where the adaptive mutations required for cross-species transmission can be present in the reservoir host. We report the use of non-invasively collected, pooled, neat urine samples as a robust sample type for investigating paramyxoviruses in bat populations. Using consensus PCR assays we have detected a high incidence and genetic diversity of novel paramyxoviruses in an urban fruit bat population over a short period of time. This may suggest a similarly unique relationship between bats and the members of the family Paramyxoviridae as proposed for some other viral families. Additionally, the high rate of bathuman contact at the study site calls for the zoonotic potential of the detected viruses to be investigated further.",

Consequently, research into bat viromes is intensifying and results obtained from those investigations show that viruses in bat populations exhibit significant genetic diversity. Marked diversity of lyssaviruses (Delmas et al., 2008) , coronaviruses (Tang et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2006) , astroviruses (Chu et al., 2008) and, more recently, adenoviruses (Li et al., 2010) and circoviruses (Ge et al., 2011) has been reported. In some cases, this diversity has led to speculation that chiropterans have ancient relationships with these viral families, and consequently act as reservoirs for emergence (Badrane & Tordo, 2001; Gouilh et al., 2011) . Bats are known to harbour multiple paramyxoviruses, including rubulaviruses and henipaviruses that have spilled over into humans and/or domestic animals (Calisher et al., 2006; Chant et al., 1998; Lau et al., 2010) .",

Samples were collected from underneath a tree holding~1500 E. helvum (coroosting with other species has not been observed at this site) that comprise part of a much larger colony of up to 1 000 000 bats in Accra (Hayman et al., 2008) . Plastic sheeting was laid out underneath the tree approximately 1 h before dawn (adapted from Chua, 2003) . On return from foraging, bats urinated and defecated on the sheets and 1 ml pools of neat urine were collected by pipette and divided equally between two vials for PCR analysis and virus isolation. Care was taken to avoid contact with faeces but it is possible that small amounts of faecal contamination were present in the samples. Samples were stored and transported at~4 u C before freezing and stored at 280 u C until further processing. RNA was extracted from 500 ml neat urine from each pool using the MagMAX viral RNA isolation kit and a MagMAX Express-96 automated extraction unit (Life Technologies -Applied Biosystems), using a 1 : 2 ratio of sample to lysis buffer.",

Both the PMV-PCR and RMH-PCR assays were highly effective at detecting novel paramyxovirus sequences and consequently will likely continue to be used in other field studies. However, they were not equivocal in their results and these analyses provide important insights into their differential capabilities that are likely applicable across other species and sites. The assays differed in their specificities, with the PMV-PCR detecting sequences throughout the Paramyxovirinae phylogeny (with the notable exception of sequences closely related to avulaviruses) and the RMH-PCR being restricted to respiro-, morbilli-and henipaviruses. This is likely caused by the greater redundancy of the PMV-PCR primers and is further evidenced by the results from 10 samples in which sequence was detected using PMV-PCR but not using RMH-PCR. The sequences derived from these 10 samples showed phylogenetic clustering (Fig. 1) , with the majority within the genus Rubulavirus. The broader specificity of the PMV-PCR is also what likely allowed this assay to detect intrasample diversity more frequently than was observed with the RMH-PCR. It should be noted, however, that sequences derived from the same sample could be derived from different viruses and/or bats due to the nature of the sampling method.",

Thus, it is likely that the uniquely detected samples in the case of the RMH-PCR are the result of increased assay sensitivity as reported in the original in vitro studies (Tong et al., 2008) . Due to differences in phylogenetic tree topology produced by different polymerase regions, and the differing sensitivity and specificity of the assays, it is difficult to comment on the relationships of sample sequences generated by different PCRs.

Indeed, novel paramyxoviruses have since been isolated and characterized from this population (K. S. Baker and others, unpublished data). Not only is collecting urine from underneath roosts highly efficacious for qualitative virus population studies, but the non-invasive nature of the collection method would facilitate the study of infection dynamics free from sampling-induced stress.

E. helvum is widely hunted in Ghana for bush meat (Kamins et al., 2011) and the population under study has a high potential for both direct and indirect contact with human beings and domestic animals. This information, coupled with the knowledge that many bat paramyxoviruses are already known to be zoonotic, makes it imperative that our findings are investigated further. Fig. 2 . Diversity of paramyxoviruses in pooled E. helvum urine samples detected by using RMH-targeted PCR. Phylogenetic tree for a 439 bp gap-stripped alignment of the polymerase gene of members of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, including sequences generated in this study and publicly available paramyxovirus genome sequences (as per Fig. 1 ) and partial paramyxovirus sequences available from this species (Ghanaian sequences GH45, GH48 and GH10). Relevant posterior probability values are shown. Bar, 0.4 expected nucleotide substitutions per site. Individual sample IDs are followed by letters denoting the clone and the GenBank accession for the sequence. Groups containing previously uncharacterized sequences that display a common phylogenetic origin supported by high posterior probability values (\u00a20.95) are highlighted by lettered grey boxes. Adjacent to each box letter is the range of nucleotide identities among sequences in the clade. Clones derived from samples that contained sequences belonging to more than one of these phylogenetically distinct clades were marked with a cross. Sequences derived from samples that were positive only with this PCR (and negative with PMV-PCR) are marked with a dot.",

Individual sample IDs are followed by letters denoting the clone and the GenBank accession number for the sequence. Groups containing previously uncharacterized sequences that display a common phylogenetic origin supported by high posterior probability values (\u00a20.95) are highlighted by numbered grey boxes. Adjacent to each box number is the range of nucleotide identities among sequences in the clade. Clones derived from samples that contained sequences belonging to more than one of these phylogenetically distinct clades were marked with a cross. Sequences derived from samples that were positive only with this PCR (and negative with RMH-PCR) are marked with a dot.",
