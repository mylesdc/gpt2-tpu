The glycoprotein hemagglutinin of influenza virus plays a crucial role in the initial stage of virus infection, making it a potential target for anti-influenza therapeutics development. Here we found that quercetin inhibited influenza infection with a wide spectrum of strains, including A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), A/FM-1/47/1 (H1N1), and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 7.756\u02d81.097, 6.225\u02d80.467, and 2.738\u02d81.931 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Mechanism studies identified that quercetin showed interaction with the HA2 subunit. Moreover, quercetin could inhibit the entry of the H5N1 virus using the pseudovirus-based drug screening system. This study indicates that quercetin showing inhibitory activity in the early stage of influenza infection provides a future therapeutic option to develop effective, safe and affordable natural products for the treatment and prophylaxis of IAV infections.",

The H1N1 subtype of swine influenza lineages has continued to circulate in humans, and serious concerns have been raised over its pandemic potential [1] . Additionally, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure with approximately 60% lethality [2] . The re-assorted influenza A virus (H7N9) has led to extra pulmonary complications with a fatality rate of more than 34% since the first case of the disease was found in China [3] . Genetic variation of influenza A viruses has resulted from genetic drift and genetic shift caused by selective pressure from the environment or host immune response, making it almost impossible to produce a timely and sufficiently effective vaccine to prevent epidemic outbreaks [4] . Consequently, development of novel strategies is urgently needed to prevent further spread of influenza A virus, among which anti-influenza agent is considered as the most effective intervention tool to control virus infections.",

MDCK cells were infected with the influenza virus with the presence of quercetin, and the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed at 48 h post-infection. In parallel, the inhibition rate was represented by the determination of the cell viability (CPE inhibition, Figure 1B ) using MTT assay. The data indicated that quercetin exerted an obvious inhibitory effect for both H1N1 and H3N2 virus strain infections in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC 50 and IC 90 values were listed in Table 1 . Considering the inhibition rate observed in inhibition against the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) was relatively lower than other strains, we subsequently explored the mechanism of its anti-influenza activity with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus strain. To investigate the inhibitory effect of quercetin on influenza virus infections, we conducted a quantitative real-time PCR to determine quercetin's inhibition on the synthesis of viral mRNA in MDCK cells and A549 cells. Cells were infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus at 100 TCID 50 in the presence of quercetin as described in the experimental section, and the total RNA was isolated from the infected cells and analysed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers specific for the viral HA mRNA at 24 h post-infection. The result revealed that quercetin reduced HA mRNA transcription in influenza-virus-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1C ,D).

            "text": "Having identified the anti-influenza activity of quercetin, we hoped to explore the potential mechanism of its anti-influenza activity. As Yu et al. [26] reported, one life cycle of the influenza virus was around 8-10 h, and was divided into three steps: virus entry (0-2 h), viral genome replication and translation (2-8 h) , and progeny virion release (8-10 h). To identify which step(s) quercetin target(s) during influenza virus infections, we performed a time-of-addition assay to study the inhibitory effect of quercetin. The infected cells were treated with quercetin in 0-2 h, 2-5 h, 5-8 h, 8-10 h and 0-10 h time intervals during virus infection respectively, then the HA protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR, which represented the extent of virus infection. As Figure 3A ,B shows, quercetin inhibited viral HA expression mainly in the 0-2 h (the entry step) and 0-10 h (the whole life cycle) time intervals, while the inhibitory effect during other time intervals was not clear. This data demonstrated that quercetin may inhibit virus infections in the early stage covering viral attachment, endocytosis and viral-cell fusion. Additionally, we conducted another relevant test to determine the effect of quercetin on virus entry ( Figure 3C ). A serially diluted compound was added to the cells during the time of virus absorption (\u22121 h p.i. (post infection)) or at 1 h post-infection (1 h p.i.). For the former, infection inoculum containing the test compound was replaced with a fresh medium containing 1 \u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin after 1 h incubation; for the latter, the compound was added after virus infection. At 48 h post-infection, the inhibition rates of influenza infection were detected through MTT assay. The results demonstrated that quercetin inhibited virus infection when it was added during the process of virus infection rather than post-virus infection. To further confirm that quercetin also impairs viral protein expressions, MDCK cells were infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus at 100 TCID 50 in the presence of various concentrations of quercetin.

As Figure 3A In addition, to determine whether quercetin targets the host cell or the virion, we designed three modes of treatment assay as previously reported with some modification [26] . As Figure 3D shows, in the first mode of treatment, namely co-treatment, MDCK cells were inoculated with the influenza virus in the presence of quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses and compounds. For the second mode, namely pre-treatment of cells, cells were incubated with quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove the unbound compounds; the pretreated cells were exposed to viruses for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses. In the third experiment, which was called the pre-treatment of the virus, the virus was incubated with quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, and the unbound compounds were subsequently removed from the virus by ultrafiltration.

As Figure 3D shows, in the first mode of treatment, namely co-treatment, MDCK cells were inoculated with the influenza virus in the presence of quercetin at 4\u02ddC for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses and compounds. For the second mode, namely pre-treatment of cells, cells were incubated with quercetin at 4\u02ddC for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove the unbound compounds; the pretreated cells were exposed to viruses for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses. In the third experiment, which was called the pre-treatment of the virus, the virus was incubated with quercetin at 4\u02ddC for 30 min, and the unbound compounds were subsequently removed from the virus by ultrafiltration. The host cells were inoculated with the pretreated viruses for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses.

HA1 is responsible for virus binding, and the HA2 subunit is responsible for viral-cell fusion. We speculated that there was a binding affinity between HA protein and quercetin and confirmed it through a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, which was designed to detect the binding between two molecules. Quercetin showed medium-binding affinity to HA protein with a K D value of 1.14\u02c610\u00b43 \u00b5g/mL. Cucurmin, which was shown to possess anti-influenza virus entry activity [27] , was used as a positive control with a K D value of 3.23\u02c610\u00b44 \u00b5g/mL in our assay (Figure 4 ). To further confirm the binding affinity between quercetin and HA protein, we conducted a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay that allowed for a quantitative analysis of interaction between small molecules and protein in-free solutions, and with low sample consumption. The interaction between small molecules and protein induces molecular changes in size, charge, hydration shell and conformation, which will affect the molecule mobility during the process of thermophoresis. The results demonstrated that quercetin interacted with influenza HA protein in a dose-dependent manner. The compound CL-385319, which was reported previously to have interacted with the influenza HA protein [28] , was used as a positive control ( Figure 5 ). binding affinity to HA protein with a KD value of 1.14 \u00d7 10 -3 \u03bcg/mL.

The contact time and dissociation time were 300 s respectively. The chip platform was regenerated with gly-HCl (pH 2.0) and washed with the running buffer. Curcumin was used as a positive control in this assay. The affinity constant KD is the ratio of dissociation constant Kd with association constant Ka, KD = Kd/Ka. ",

Several studies have identified inhibitors of the receptor binding or membrane fusion activities of HA, particularly the latter [37, 38] . Speculating that quercetin could interact with HA and subsequently interfere with virus entry, we used two procedures to assess whether there was a binding affinity between quercetin and HA protein. In the first, the binding affinity was measured by SPR assay, and the result indicated that quercetin showed a medium binding affinity to influenza HA protein. While SPR is an assay that performed by immobilizing one of the binding partners to a thin noble metal film [39] , surface immobilization therein may affect the bound molecules' dynamics and thus alter the binding event. Subsequently, a solution-based MST assay was performed to further confirm the binding affinity between quercetin and HA. As a solution-based method, microscale thermophoresis avoids such surface artifacts and immobilization procedures. Instead, one of the binding partners was fluorescently labeled [40] . The MST assay provided strong support for the result of SPR, confirming that quercetin exhibited a binding affinity to HA. The following design utilized multiple assays to further identify the potential target of quercetin. The HI assay and hemolysis inhibition assay indicated that quercetin efficiently inhibited entry of the influenza A virus, which may be mainly ascribed to its interaction with the HA2 subunit, which mediates the low pH-induced fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. Additionally, the influenza H5N1 pseudovirus neutralization assay showed quercetin potently neutralized different strains of HA pseudotyped H5N1 viruses, which reconfirmed that quercetin may target viral surface HA protein and thus inhibit virus infection.",

We will explore the potential synergistic antiviral effect of quercetin and other antiretroviral agents in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that quercetin is also available as a dietary supplement with daily doses of 200-1200 mg (manufacturers' recommendations) in some countries, and it may present its potential as animal feed additives to reduce the risk of avian influenza virus infection in poultry farms.

This data demonstrated that quercetin may inhibit virus infections in the early stage covering viral attachment, endocytosis and viral-cell fusion. Additionally, we conducted another relevant test to determine the effect of quercetin on virus entry (Figure 3C). A serially diluted compound was added to the cells during the time of virus absorption (\u00b41 h p.i. (post infection)) or at 1 h post-infection (1 h p.i.). For the former, infection inoculum containing the test compound was replaced with a fresh medium containing 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin after 1 h incubation; for the latter, the compound was added after virus infection. At 48 h post-infection, the inhibition rates of influenza infection were detected through MTT assay. The results demonstrated that quercetin inhibited virus infection when it was added during the process of virus infection rather than post-virus infection.",
