            "text": "Background: Infections are often associated to comorbidity that increases the risk of medical conditions which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says \"I'd rather have HIV than diabetes\" as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes. Results: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and the \u03c6-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

Patient medical records contain important clarification regarding the co-occurrences of diseases affecting the same patient [2] . During the last few years, several researchers have been conducted the disease comorbidity analysis to understand the origins of many diseases [1, 12, 18] . Goh, Cusick, Valle, Childs, Vidal, Barabasi et al. and Feldman, Rzhetsky, Vitkup et al. built networks of gene-disease associations by connecting diseases that have been associated with the same genes [14, 15] , whereas Lee, Park, Kay, Christakis, Oltvai and Barab\u00e1si et al. constructed a network in which two diseases are linked if metabolic reactions are associated between them [13] . Disease association studies from proteomic point of view have been studied by Rual, Venkatesan, Hao, Hirozane-Kishikawa, Dricot, Li, Berriz, Gibbons, Dreze, Ayivi-Guedehoussou et al. and Stelzl, Worm, Lalowski, Haenig, Brembeck, Goehler, Stroedicke, Zenkner, Schoenherr, Koeppen et al. [19, 20] . Rzhetsky, Wajngurt, Park and Zheng et al. inferred the comorbidity links between 161 disorders from the disease history of 1.5 million patients [12] . However, all of these efforts have focused on the role of a single molecular or phenotypic measure to capture disease-disease relationships. In our work we have used disease-gene associations, PPIs, molecular pathways and clinical information to obtain statistically significant associations and comorbidity risks among diseases.",

Also the flu can cause complications, including bacterial pneumonia, or the worsening of chronic health problems. Asthma is the most common comorbidity in patients hospitalized for swine influenza (H1N1) infection [23] . Dengue can cause myocardial impairment, arrhythmias and, occasionally, fulminant myocarditis [24] . Chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, renal disease, rheumatologic disease, dementia, and stroke are risk factors for influenza complications [25] . Common chronic infections such as periodontitis or infection with Helicobacter pylori may also increase stroke risk [26] . Moreover, the severity of pneumonia in patients coinfected with influenza virus and bacteria is significantly higher than in those infected with bacteria alone. The incidence of flu is higher in children and younger adults than in older individuals, but influenzaassociated morbidity and mortality increase with age, especially for individuals with underlying medical conditions such as chronic cardiovascular diseases [27] . During the ageing process the immune system becomes compromised and it causes an increasing inflammation [28] . In particular, chronic inflammation (inflammageing) and metabolic function are strongly affected by the ageing process [29] . The ageing of populations is leading to an unprecedented increase different diseases like cancer and fatalities. It is reported that 80% of the elderly population has three or more chronic conditions [30] .",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause respiratory and enteric diseases in human and other animals that induce fatal respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an epidemic human disease, is caused by a coronavirus (CoV), called SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [32] . SARS patients may present with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from flu-like symptoms and viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [33] . Most of the deaths were attributed to complications related to sepsis, ARDS and multiorgan failure, which occurred commonly in the elderly for comorbidities [34] . Age and comorbidity (e.g. diabetes mellitus, heart disease) were consistently found to be significant independent predictors of various adverse outcomes in SARS [35] . Children with SARS have better prognosis than adults [34] . Advanced age and comorbidities were significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV related death, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome [35] . Mild degree of anaemia is common in the SARS infected patients and patients who have recovered from SARS show symptoms of psychological trauma [34] . Another novel coronavirus MERS-CoV, which is a new threat for public health, has similar clinical characteristics to SARS-CoV, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts [36, 37] . MERS-CoV causes respiratory infections of varying severity and sometimes fatal infections in humans including kidney failure and severe acute pneumonia [38] . Despite sharing some clinical similarities with SARS (eg, fever, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 cough, incubation period), there are also some important differences such as the rapid progression to respiratory failure, which we have studied on comorbidities point of view.",

HIV infection severely impacts on the immune system causing phenotypic changes in peripheral cells and dysregulates the innate immune system [40] . Significant number of HIV-1 infected patients exhibits osteopenia and osteoporosis, leading to higher incidence to develop weak and fragile bones during the course of disease [41] . HIV has also been associated with an increased risk of developing both diabetes and cardiovascular disease [42] . Infection with HIV weakens the immune system and reduces the body's ability to fight infections that may lead to cancer [43, 44] . People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a higher risk of some types of cancer (Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, anal, liver, lung cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma) than uninfected people [45] . Many people infected with HIV are also infected with other viruses that cause certain cancers [46, 47] . HIV infection even when controlled by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is being linked to chronic inflammation [48] . People with HIV-1 infection appear to have a markedly higher rate of chronic kidney disease than the general public [49] . It is because some of the risk factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition are the same as those that lead to kidney disease because of the virus itself and some therapies (e.g. HAART therapy). Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension) and thus predispose to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Many of the biologic factors thought to be causally associated with inflammation in HIV disease are also thought to be causally associated with the inflammation of ageing [50] .",

To understand the overall mechanism we have studied the comorbidity associations of SARS and HIV infections. Both HIV and SARS are emerging infectious diseases in the modern world; each of these diseases has caused global societal and economic impact related to unexpected illnesses and deaths [54] . SRAS is a significant public health threat and HIV is a long term chronic infection. Since these two infections are associated with high mortality rates and there are no clinically approved antiviral treatments or vaccines available for either of these infections, we have selected these two infections for our study.

The number of interlinked genes between SARS infection and other diseases indicates that immunological, hematological, neurological, metabolic and dermatological diseases categories are strongly associated with the SARS infection (see Figure 1 and Additional file 3: Table S3 ). Few genes are also shared between more than 2 categories of diseases i.e those disease groups are also associated through at least that genes. For an instance, the gene ATM shared among SARS infection, cancer and immunological diseases. Therefore, cancer and immunological diseases are also interrelated through the gene ATM. Among all these disease classes immunological diseases class is tightly correlated with the SARS infection due to the highest number of genes (12 genes) shared between them. On the other hand, the number of associated genes between HIV infection and other diseases indicates that neurological, metabolic, cancer and hematological diseases categories are strongly correlated with the HIV infection (see Figure 2 and Additional file 4: Figure 1 The gene-disease association network centred on the SARS infection is constructed based on the different categories of diseases that are connected and showed comorbidities with the SARS infection through the different genes.

After several steps of statistical analysis we have selected the most significant over and under expressed genes for each infection and disease. We also performed cross compare analysis to find the common significant genes between each disease and SARS/ HIV-1 infection. We observed that SARS infection shares 21, 12, 16, 5, 11, 11, 11 and 13 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, HIV-1 infection, type 1 and type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, HIV-1 infection shares 11, 10, 17, 9, 7, 11, 9 and 7 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, SARS infection, type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Then we built disease-disease relationships network for SARS and HIV-1 infection with other diseases (see Figures 3 (a) and (b) and Additional file 5: Table S5 and Additional file 6: Table S6 ). Since genes do not function alone and they coordinate their activities in the form of complexes or molecular pathways. Therefore two diseases are potentially inter-correlated to each other if they share at least one commonly associated pathway. For this http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 reason we have used reactome pathway database [60] and selected the pathways related to these 7 diseases as well as SARS and HIV-1 infections. We have observed that diseases and infections shared pathways between them as shown in Figures 3 (a) and (b) and Additional file 5: Table  S5 and Additional file 6: Table S6 .",

To find statistically significant associations among diseases, we built disease networks centred on the SARS and HIV infections in which two diseases are comorbid if there exists one or more protein subnetwork that are associated with both diseases. The disease similarity network and the protein-protein interaction network are integrated systematically and comprehensively in a simple and compact manner to formulate the disease comorbidity for the SARS and HIV-1 infections as shown in Figures 4 and 5.

So, we constructed a phenotypic disease comorbidity network using 32 million medical records of 13039018 patients data from MedPAR and analysed its structural properties to better understand the connections among diseases and infections. Nodes are unique diseases and edges indicate co-morbidity of the diseases. We included edges between disease pairs for which the co-occurrence is significantly greater than the random expectation based on population prevalence of the diseases. As pointed out in [2] , the Relative Risk (RR ij ) overestimates relations involving rare infections and diseases, and underestimates relationships between very common disorders or infections. On the other hand, \u03c6-correlation underestimates comorbidity between rare and frequent diseases, and discriminates associations between disorders of similar appearances. Thus, we built a network by selecting only the statistically significant network edges having RR ij \u2265 20 and \u03c6 ij \u2265 0.06. Figure 7 summarises the set of all comorbidity associations among all diseases expressed in the study population by constructing a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). In the PDN, nodes are disease phenotypes identified by unique ICD-9-CM (The International Classification of Diseases) disease codes, and links connect phenotypes that show significant comorbidity according to the relative risk RR ij \u2265 20 and the correlation \u03c6 ij \u2265 0.06.

So, to understand the impact of ageing on the disease comorbidities for SARS and HIV infections we have considered the ageing data from the GenAge database (http://genomics.senescence. info/genes/human.html) [62, 63] . After cross comparing http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 Human lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [32] . Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signalling to SARS-CoV is crucial to better understand SARS pathogenesis. Since both of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections cause severe lung pathology we compare and contrast the genes expression level of SARS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV infection. To compare between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, and the affect on the disease comorbidities, we have performed the time series microarray data analysis for the both types of infections on lung compared to controls. We have considered gene expression microarray data from the NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/ acc.cgi?acc=GSE45042) [64] . From the analysis of SARS-CoV vs mock-infected controls (treated the same way except without the virus) we have found 215 genes are highly significant and from the analysis of MERS-CoV vs Mock we have found 234 gens are highly significant (see details in the Additional file 11: Table S11 and Additional  file 12: Table S12 ). Interestingly, only 4 genes (NFKBIA, EGR1, DDIT31 and IFIT2) are common between these two infections (see Figure 13 ). However, only 2 genes (NFKBIA and EGR1) play an important role and differentially expressed among the both infections in lung and also in SARS infected PBMCs. Then from the hierarchical cluster analysis of the differentially expressed genes of the lung infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we observed distinct groups of genes that were significantly changed over time (see Additional file 13: Figure S1 and Additional file 14: Figure S2 , and Additional file 11: Table S11 and Additional file 12: Table S12 ).",

The finding is that the earlier the metformin regimen was initiated, the greater the http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 preventive benefit for the cancer patient. There is an evidence that the antiviral medication, ribavirin, does not work in case of SARS infection [66] . To this end, we used Connectivity Map (Cmap), which is a database of more than 1,400 drug transcriptional signatures in several cell lines [67] . This database allows to identify of molecules that induce similar or opposite transcriptional changes relative to the query signature, based on their connectivity enrichment scores. As a query signature we used our 274 highly dysregulated genes for the SARS infection. We generated the connectivity score value ranges between +1 and -1, where a highly positive score indicates that the drug induces changes similar to those induced by viral infection, while a highly negative score indicates that the drug reverses the expression of the SARS signature. Based on the connectivity score we have selected most potential positive and negative regulators of SARS viral response (see details in the Additional file 15: Table  S13 ). Potential negative regulators indicate that drugs reverse the SARS signature gene expression. Among the negative potential regulator, the drug molecule tetracycline, zalcitabine, gibberellic acid, prestwick-642 and sulfaquinoxaline are more potential for the MCF7 cell line and vorinostat for the HL60 cell line. Based on the data demonstrate the efficacy of different drug against SARS virus can be predicted effective drug treatment for the emergent viruses. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs that reduce the excessive host inflammatory response to respiratory viruses have therapeutic benefit to reduce the SARS infection as well as disease comorbidities.",

Based on the combined genetics, PPIs, pathways and clinical data, our disease networks can disclose potentially novel disease relationships that have not been captured by previous individual studies. The underlying hypothesis behind this line of research is that once we catalogue all disease-related genes, PPI complex and signalling pathways, if we do not consider environmental changes, we will be able to predict the susceptibility of each individual to future diseases using various molecular biomarkers and it will help us to enter an era of predictive medicine. Our results indicate that such a combination of molecular and population-level data could help to build novel hypotheses about disease mechanisms.

Moreover we have studied before about the impact of HIV infection on bone diseases and infection (e. g. osteoporosis and osteomyelitis). We observed that genes (e.g. RANKL) and pathways (e.g. NF-\u03baB) that are dysregulated by HIV infection also impact on the bone remodelling and bone related diseases. It is also recognised that inflammation plays a role in cancer aetiology, and various studies have found that inflammation may causes IRIS, obesity and tumour-promoting effects [69] . Moreover, inflammation is an important concomitant cause of many major age-associated pathologies such as cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes [70] . Our study provides important evidence to associate diseases with the ageing process at the system level and helps to understand more about the comorbidities of the complex diseases. The ageing process itself is accompanied by a chronic low-grade inflammation, which is termed \"inflammageing\". The combination of metabolic-driven and age-driven inflammatory pathways plays a pivotal role in disease progression.

Although the disease started in the most unique network of prion accumulation and replication it is progressed to the other networks. Based on this approach we may propose a pathway model for comorbidities how hubs genes dysregulate several other pathways to influence comorbidities. The number of dysregulated pathways could be proportional to the amount of dysregulation of hub genes. Our pathway model may states that the hubs that are over turned on, may direct the signal to the different pathways creating comorbidities as shown in Figure 17 . For the infection, one of the pathways related to the inflammation starts dysregulation. With increasing time, both confidence level of inflammation and the number of dysregulated pathways are increased. Moreover, with the increasing of inflammation the number of diseases for the comorbidities may increase. So initially infection dysregulates one signalling pathway of any cells and that causes other pathways may be dysrupted. In this way disrupting pathways increase more diseases in the same patient and make multimorbidity.",

Based on the information of the existing disease, the model will predict disease comorbidities using the disease-disease associations database. This will provide us to detect many diseases at the earliest detectable phase, even weeks, months, or maybe years before the symptoms appear and it will afford crucial insights into optimizing of our wellness. Thus, personalised medicine will give fundamental new insights into disease mechanisms, and hence will open new opportunities for diagnosis, therapy and prevention from the disease comorbidities.",

We have shown that the phenotype disease network (PDN) has a heterogeneous structure where some diseases are highly connected while others are hardly connected at all. Our findings showed that disease progression can be represented and studied using network methods, offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of human diseases. Detecting comorbidity in a large population is of clinical interest due to the fact that it may reveal new information useful for cause of diseases as well as for new treatment strategies. This study demonstrates the value of an integrated approach in revealing disease relationships and new opportunities for therapeutic applications. So we can say that this kind of approach will be helpful for making evidence-based recommendations about disease comorbidities. Moreover, considering environmental factors (such as physiological stress, diet), ethnic group and gender discriminations are important factors in the comorbidity analysis. Our network approach could be extended as a comorbidity map by integrating diet, exercise and other factors as in [74] .",

Genotype-phenotype relationships, as summarised in the OMIM database, contained more than 5000 human disease-genes associations involving 1500 diseases and 3000 disease associated genes. Each entry of the OMIM is composed of four fields, the name of the disorder, the associated gene symbols, its corresponding OMIM id, and the chromosomal location. We selected the entries with the \"(3)\" tag, for which there is strong evidence that at least one mutation is cause of the disorder. OMIM initially focused on monogenic disorders but in recent years has expanded to include complex traits and the associated genetic mutations that confer susceptibility to these common disorders [58] . Subsequently we classified each disorder into 21 primary disorder classes based on the physiological system affected as introduced in Goh, Cusick, Valle, Childs, Vidal and Barabasi et al. [14] . Disorders having distinct multiple clinical features are assigned to the \"multiple\" class. This classification scheme reflects the phenotypic similarities among diseases in the same class and has been successfully used in the recent studies of systematic disease analysis [77] .",

In the second step, we have used a most suitable method \"maSigPro\" (microarray Significant Profiles) to identify differentially expressed genes in time-course microarray experiments, which is a two step regression method successfully applied on more than one groups of time-series [85, 86] . This two steps regression strategy is used to find genes with significant temporal expression changes and significant differences between experimental groups. This procedure first adjusts this global model by the leastsquared technique to identify differentially expressed genes and selects significant genes applying false discovery rate control procedures. Then stepwise regression is applied as a variable selection strategy to study differences between experimental groups and statistically significant profiles. After finding differentially gene expression profiles among the group of experiments, the next step is to cluster them according to their profile similarities. The hierarchical clustering and the median gene expression profiles of clusters are performed according to the \"maSigPro\" package in R [85] .",

For the analysis of the phenotypic data, we used the Relative Risk (RR ij ) as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and checked \u03c6-correlation (\u03c6 ij ) to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The RR ij is observing in a pair of diseases i and j affecting the same patient. When two diseases co-occur more frequently than expected by chance, we will get RR ij > 1 and \u03c6 ij > 0. However, RR ij and \u03c6 ij are not independent of each other and each carries unique biases that are complementary [1, 2] . So, we used both measures of comorbidity to ensure the robustness of our investigations. The RR ij allows us to quantify the co-occurrence of disease pairs compared with the random expectation which is calculated as: (3) where N is the total number of patients in the population, P i is the incidences/prevalences of disease i, P j is the incidence of disease j and C ij is the number of patients that have been diagnosed with both diseases i and j. For RR ij >= 1 comorbidity is larger than expected by chance and for RR ij < 1 comorbidity is smaller than expected by chance. To calculate the significance of the relative risk RR ij , we used the Katz, Baptista, Azen and Pike et al. method to estimate confidence intervals [90] . According to their estimation, the 99% confidence interval for the RR ij between two diseases i and j is calculated by: Lower bounds of the confidence interval (LB) = RR ij * exp(\u22122.56 * \u03c3 ij ) and Upper bounds of the confidence interval (UB) = RR ij * exp(2.56 * \u03c3 ij ), where \u03c3 ij is given by:",

To find out the correlation (similarities) and distance (dissimilarities) among the diseases from the integrated analysis of multidimensional data (gene expression and protein protein interaction), we have applied Euclidian distance measurement and metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) using majorization [93] . MDS is a set of methods for discovering hidden structures in multidimensional data. Based on a proximity matrix derived from variables measured on objects as input entity, these distances are mapped on a lower dimensional spatial representation. Optimization problem is used to find mapping in target dimension of the data based on given pairwise proximity information while minimize the objective function. The particular objective function (or loss function) we used in this work is a sum of squares, commonly called stress. We used majorization to minimize stress and this MDS solving strategy is known as SMACOF (Scaling by MAjorizing a COmplicated Function). Stress majorization is an optimization strategy used in multidimensional scaling (MDS) where, for a set of nm-dimensional data items, a configuration X of n points in r(<< m)-dimensional space is sought that minimizes the stress function \u03c3 (X).",

So from this observation it is recognised that SARS and HIV-1 infections are also linked with the ageing process of human through the regulation of distinct genes and pathways. On the other hand, ageing is directly linked with some other diseases and inflammation including cancers. Thus SARS and HIV infections also make comorbidities with other diseases through the genes related to ageing process. So the infection of SARS and HIV play multi way comorbidities with different diseases.
