The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations.",

We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present a non-zoonotic example (cholera in the Dominican Republic). Estimation is based on two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F). If detection of a case does not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster, we find that R can be estimated by 12G; otherwise R can be estimated by 12F when the case detection rate is low. In more general cases, bounds on R can still be derived.",

Prior to widespread emergence in human populations, such pathogens can cause occasional infections in subpopulations that have been exposed to reservoir species (common reservoir species include for example bats, birds, swine, non-human primates). Whilst viruses causing such ''spill-over'' infections are usually poorly adapted for sustained human-to-human transmission, they are under strong selection pressure to increase transmissibility once in humans [4] . If the reproduction number R (i.e., the average number of persons infected by a case) evolves to exceed 1, a large scale epidemic in humans may result. Over the last decade, particular concerns were raised regarding highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, due to the high mortality rate seen in humans and the virus's rapid spread in avian populations. However, as the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic demonstrated, H5N1 is not the only influenza virus that may pose a pandemic risk. Recently, a swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H3N2) variant virus has emerged in the United States, carrying the matrix gene (M) from the H1N1pdm09 virus (H3N2v-M) [2] [3] [4] . Studies in animal models have suggested that the presence of the H1N1pdm09 M gene may increase transmissibility of the virus [5, 6] . From January 2012 to September 2012, 307 laboratory-confirmed H3N2v-M human infections were reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] as opposed to 12 throughout 2011 [6] . The majority of cases have been associated with agricultural fairs but there are documented events of human-to-human transmission [7] . The surge in cases observed in summer 2012 raised public health concerns [8] . Threats from zoonoses are not limited to influenza: more than half of all recent emerging infectious disease events were zoonotic [9] .",

            "text": "For efficient prevention and control, quantitative and rigorous assessment of the risks associated with emerging zoonoses is desirable-in particular the risk that an emerging pathogen evolves to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. One approach to such risk assessment is by monitoring the reproduction number R of zoonoses in humans, with an alarm being raised if R increases or approaches 1 [9] [10] [11] . However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters [10, 11] and suffered from three important limitations: (1) the resources, access, and expertise needed to conduct investigations is not always available; (2) the proportion of cases that are missed during outbreak investigations may vary by setting and be difficult to assess; (3) even if the study is complete, the data collection process can be affected by a selection bias whereby larger outbreaks are more likely to be detected so that estimates of transmissibility may be biased upward. Consider for example a scenario where R = 0.7, where each case has the same detection probability r = 1%, and assume that once a cluster is detected, detailed outbreak investigation ensures that all cases in the cluster are detected. With an average size of 18.3 and a 21% probability of 1-case cluster, clusters that are detected are substantially larger than normal ones (average size: 3.3; 65% probability of 1-case cluster) ( Figure 1A ). As expected, this selection bias leads to R being overestimated as illustrated for methods that use the distribution of detected cluster sizes ( Figure 1B ) [10] .",

When the case detection rate r is relatively low, at levels similar to those seen in sentinel systems like the US influenza virological surveillance network, the straight line dependence shown in Figure 2 illustrates that R can be estimated as R = 12F (see Methods and Text S1). We find that it takes relatively high levels of case detection (r) or case-to-case variation in infectiousness (k) to cause substantial deviations from this linear relationship, and even then, such deviation only occurs for values of R close to 1 ( Figure 2 ). We also find that the relationship is only weakly sensitive to having multiple chains of transmission per cluster of human cases ( Figure S1 ; Text S1).",

For the H3N2v-M virus, the point estimate and the lower bound of the 95% CI of R are 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. The upper bound of the 95% CI of R lies between 0.8 and .1, depending on assumptions about the case detection rate and overdispersion parameter (Table 1 ).

However, assume that r is unknown and that we plan to use estimator 12F, which is unbiased so long as r is small. As the detection rate r increases, so does the bias of estimator 12F. However, for a fixed number of clusters occurring in the study population, larger detection rates increase precision through larger sample sizes. There is therefore a trade-off between the bias and precision of the estimator 12F. This is illustrated in Figure 4A , for a scenario with reproduction number R = 0.5, overdispersion parameter k = 0.5 and where a total of 10,000 clusters occur. In this scenario, the optimum (i.e., minimizing the root mean square error) trade-off in bias versus precision is obtained for a detection rate of r = 1.5%. We find that the optimum detection rate for estimator 12F is a decreasing function of the reproduction number R and the total number of clusters n, but an increasing function of overdispersion parameter k ( Figure 4B ). We also find that the absolute bias at the optimum detection rate remains relatively small (,0.06) ( Figure 4C ). In Figure S5 and Text S1, we show that thinning the data may eliminate the bias of the 12F estimator, though combining information from F and G (see below) is a simpler and more convenient approach to the same goal.",

Nipah virus is primarily clinically characterized by fever and encephalitis and was first discovered in a large outbreak in Malaysia in 1998-1999 [17, 18] . During this outbreak (where sick pigs were believed to be the natural reservoir), Parashar et al. [19] conducted a case-control study of the risk factors for infection. They recruited patients who were hospitalized with encephalitis from January through April 1999. Candidate encephalitis patients whose serum specimen tested positive for Nipah antibody were included as cases. Other cases were detected through targeted investigations; but if we restrict analyses to the subset of patients detected through hospital surveillance, this situation resembles surveillance scenario 1 above, where the probability of being detected is independent of cluster allocation. Here, we can therefore estimate the reproduction number as R = 12G. Probability G can be approximated using the data of Parashar et al. [19] by the proportion of cases who (1) either lived or worked in a farm (G 1 ) or (2) handled a pig, or came within 1 m of a pig and came into contact with pig urine or faeces (G 2 ). Parashar et al. [19] only give estimates for the pooled set of cases (i.e., hospital surveillance+targeted investigations) for which G 1 = 95% and G 2 = 92%; however, it should be straightforward to derive these statistics for the subset of cases detected through hospital surveillance alone. For G = 0.92-0.95, we estimate R = 0.05-0.08. This suggests low levels of human-to-human transmission in this first outbreak. [21] . They classified 60 of the 122 identified Nipah virus cases as reservoir-to-human infections (G = 49%). Using the simple estimator R = 12G, we obtain R = 0.51. This is consistent with more detailed contact tracing data that estimated R = 0.48 [21] . However, both these estimators may be biased upwards as the Bengali situation corresponds to surveillance scenario 2 (i.e., detection of a case may trigger an outbreak investigation), which may lead to the selection bias discussed earlier. In such a context, we recommend running our analysis on the subset of first detected cases in each of the 23 introductions and estimating proportion F. Again, it should be possible to derive F from data collected at the time. Since the case detection rate is unknown, we expect 12F to act as a lower bound for R ( Figure 5 ). From the estimates of G and F, we should therefore be able to derive simple bounds on R: 1{F \u0192R\u01921{G~0:51.",

F is the proportion of first detected cases in each cluster that were infected by the reservoir. This research project was initiated to answer a seemingly straightforward question: 50% of the H3N2v-M cases that were detected in the US in 2011 had no contact with swine. What were the implications for the level of human-to-human transmission? At the time, however, the answer did not appear as straightforward as our analysis now shows it to be, with these simple estimators R = 12G or R = 12F, depending on the surveillance scenario we are in. Our approach has specific properties that potentially overcome some of the limitations of existing methods. First, the investigation effort required is less than that for other methods. For example, if there is active case finding (surveillance scenario 2), one only needs to investigate the source of infection of the first case detected in each cluster. Second, the statistical treatment of the data is extremely simple, making it possible for anyone to interpret raw surveillance statistics about the source of infection of cases (statistics G or F) in terms of human-to-human transmissibility (reproduction number R). Third, the method is robust to selection bias (i.e., the fact that larger clusters are more likely to be detected) and under-ascertainment (i.e., ability to detect all cases in a cluster once a cluster is identified).",

In the US H3N2v-M context, where most individuals have no contact with swine, it is usually relatively easy to rule out the natural reservoir as a source of infection. Determining the source of infection might however be harder in situations where a large part of the population has regular contacts with the natural reservoir (e.g., backyard poultry in rural areas). In this case, an in-depth epidemiological investigation of the potential sources of infection is required. Clearly our approach cannot be used if the zoonotic source has not been identified yet. That being said, the examples we have presented show that proxy measures for the source of transmission (e.g., contacts with the natural reservoir) are often available. Although imperfect, these proxy measures are often already used by the scientific and public health community. For example, the World Health Organization fact sheet on Nipah virus states that ''in Bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission'' [23] . Our methods improve this existing practice in at least three ways: (1) it adds an essential layer of interpretation by providing estimates of the reproduction number, R, which allows assessment of how far transmission is from being sustained (R$1); (2) it clarifies sources of potential biases; and (3) it provides simple guidelines to reduce these biases (see summary in Box 1).",

If the source of infection is uncertain, the analysis of detailed outbreak data [11, 24] might allow estimation of the probability that the case was infected by the reservoir, which could then be used to estimate F and R using our methods. Phylogenetic analysis might also help resolve uncertainties about the source of infection. Clearly, our approach will start to break down if the proportion of cases with missing data becomes too large or if the classification of cases is too unreliable.

Zoonotic viruses are viruses that are transmissible from animals to humans; the global health threat of zoonotic viruses was recently demonstrated by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the SARS epidemic in 2003. Many zoonotic viruses are transmitted by means of an infected vector, while others can be transmitted by inhalation, contact with infected excretions, or by direct contact with an infected animal. Zoonotic viruses primarily cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species (the animal species harboring the virus) because the pathogens are usually poorly adapted for sustained human-to-human transmission. However, zoonotic viruses are under strong selective pressure to acquire the ability for human-to-human transmission.",

The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza epidemic was alarming to many because of the high mortality rate in humans and its rapid spread in avian populations. Public health response to outbreaks such as those of H5N1 avian influenza and SARS required reliable estimates of transmissibility (how easily it spreads between people) and severity (the proportion of infected people who needed hospital treatment). For efficient prevention and control of the emerging epidemic, quantitative and rigorous assessment of the associated risks is needed. Specifically, health officials and researchers need fast, reliable methods for estimating the extent to which a virus has acquired the ability to transmit from person to person. In this study, the authors developed a novel method to estimate a standard measure of transmissibility, the human-to-human reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case) of a zoonotic virus, which overcomes many of the limitations of existing methods.",

By using two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F), the authors estimated R, the reproduction number of zoonoses in humans. The authors then applied their new approach to assess the human-to-human transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A variant (H1N1v, H1N2v, and H3N2v) virus, in particular that of the H3N2v-M virus, from US surveillance data for the period December 2005-December 2011, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, as well as to a non-zoonotic pathogen Vibrio Cholerae in the Dominican Republic.
