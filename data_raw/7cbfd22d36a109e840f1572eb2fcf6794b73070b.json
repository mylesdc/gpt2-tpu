            "text": "Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.",

Building on the similarities between these epidemics-regarding the route of transmission, the surveillance system, the population and the location-we show that prior information available at the time could have improved the forecasting of relevant public health indicators (i.e. epidemic size, maximal incidence, peak date and epidemic duration) from a very early point. The method we describe, together with the compilation of past epidemics, improves epidemic forecasting.",

These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is difficult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [15] . Yet, it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that forecasts would help public health authorities decide on the best strategies for control or mitigation.",

But in addition to specifying a model, selecting good parameter values is also essential to obtain good predictions. In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [20] , mobility patterns [21] [22] [23] [24] , and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [25] . Such information is less easily available and more limited for mosquitotransmitted diseases [26] .

Surveillance data on CHIKV epidemics in the French West Indies was available from local health authorities (S2 Dataset (D2)) [30] . Finally, we also selected the ZIKV and CHIKV epidemics that occured in six islands or archipelagoes of French Polynesia between 2013 and 2017, as they provided information on the differences between the two diseases. Surveillance data regarding the outbreaks in French Polynesia (S3 Dataset (D3)) was collected following similar methods as in the French West Indies [31, 32] .",

The generation time distribution was reconstructed by estimating the durations of each part of the infection cycle using disease-and mosquito-specific data from the literature, and assuming a fixed local temperature of 28\u02daC, as described in more detail in the supplementary appendix. This led to gamma distributions with mean 2.5 weeks (standard deviation: 0.7) for ZIKV and with mean 1.6 weeks (sd: 0.6) for CHIKV.",

The a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and reporting rates for the ZIKV epidemics in the French West Indies defining the NI, R or L approaches are shown in Fig 2. The R priors were wide, with 95% credible intervals between 0.5 and 2.5 for R 0;Z and between 0 and 0.30 for \u03c1 Z . On the contrary, the more specific L priors on R 0;Z were highly concentrated around 1.5 in Guadeloupe and 1.3 in Martinique, and ranged between 1.0 and 1.8 in Saint-Martin. Likewise, the island-specific priors on \u03c1 Z carried more information that their regional counterpart, peaking around 0.19 in Guadeloupe, and covering wider intervals in Martinique (0.20-0.40) and Saint-Martin (0.03-0.39). Fig 3 shows the future course of the ZIKV epidemics predicted using data available two weeks after date \"S\" in each island, for the three choices of prior distributions. At this week, predictions with the NI priors were largely off-target, overestimating the future magnitude of the epidemic in all three islands. Using the R priors reduced the gap between forecasts and future observation. Major improvements in both accuracy and sharpness were obtained only with L priors. These results were typical of the initial phase of the epidemics, as shown in Fig 4. Overall, the quality of the forecasts improved as K increases in all three islands and also as prior distributions brought more specific information. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that L priors defined here outperformed or performed at least equivalently to the alternative priors definition tested (S1 Appendix).",

Bayesian approaches allow such transportation using informative a priori distributions on model parameters [27] . Historical data on CHIKV epidemics was therefore used to build informative a priori distributions on the two key parameters R 0;Z and \u03c1 Z . Hierarchical models are particularly adapted to this task, as they naturally pool information among several past epidemics and capture both within-and between-location variability [43] . We used separate hierarchical models to obtain information about (i) transmissibility and reporting during CHIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies and (ii) relative transmissibility and reporting between ZIKV and CHIKV in French Polynesia, rather than from a global joint model (as in [44] ). This choice was made to show that prior information can be combined from separate sources in a modular way. We finally considered two versions of informative priors to capture different degrees of knowledge. The \"Local\" priors corresponded with estimates for the previous CHIKV epidemic in the same island, therefore including island-specific epidemic drivers, such as population structure and distribution, socio-economic circumstances and environmental conditions. On the other hand, the \"Regional\" priors encompassed the diversity of past observations within the region, making priors valid for a typical island of the West Indies, especially when no other epidemic has been observed previously.",

Worst case projections on maximal incidence were very imprecise, ranging between 2 and 63 times the eventually reached maximal weekly incidence. Using historical data led to a substantial increase of the quality of these forecasts from the very early stages of the epidemics. Using \"local\" priors, the ratio between forecasts and reality ranged between 0.4 and 1.5 for epidemic size and between 1.3 and 3.9 for maximal incidence.

Comparing and systematically evaluating models' forecasting performances is still at the beginning. As of now, comparisons targeted the merits of different models including exponential growth models, sigmoid models, or mechanistic epidemic models [45] . Our work provides a complementary approach where information from past epidemics is combined using hierarchical models to inform on parameter ranges, thus increasing the reliability of early forecasts. It was applied here to a dynamic discrete-time SIR model that for its parsimony is well-adapted to real-time forecasting. Complex mechanistic models can provide a more realistic description of the epidemic, accounting, for instance, for heterogenous spatial distribution of individuals and mobility coupling-a relevant ingredient for describing epidemics in more extended spatial areas -, or vector population dynamics and its mixing with humans.

Also, using informative priors to make up for the lack of information during the early stages of an epidemic has been done before. For instance, a priori information from the ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia has been used to support the early forecasts of health-care requirements for the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique [38] . In this case, however, authors concluded that a prior built from an epidemic in a different location resulted in inaccurate predictions at the early stage. We found a similar result in a sensitivity analysis: the direct use of information from ZIKV in French Polynesia, or alternatively the direct use of information from CHIKV in the French West Indies, without adjusting for ZIKV, leads to poor overall forecasting quality compared to the L prior considered here (S1 Appendix).",

For influenza, it has been reported that the reproduction ratios in two successive flu pandemics (1889 and 1918) showed substantial correlation (r = 0.62) in the same US cities, even years apart [54] . For Aedes-transmitted diseases, comparisons of ZIKV and dengue virus outbreaks [55] and of ZIKV with CHIKV outbreaks [44] in the same locations have highlighted similarities in the epidemic dynamics. In any case, careful consideration of all the factors that may influence transmission and reporting is needed. For example, contrary to CHIKV, some cases of sexual transmission have been reported for ZIKV [56, 57] . Yet, no epidemics were seen in locations without enough Aedes mosquitoes, as for example in metropolitan France, despite the introductions of several hundreds ZIKV infected cases [58] . This justifies the use of CHIKV epidemic data to provide prior information on ZIKV in the epidemic context considered here. More generally, documenting, analyzing and comparing more systematically past epidemics [59] is necessary to provide the data required to derive prior information. In particular, informed with epidemiological records of the recent CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics, our approach could be applied to potential future emergences of other Aedes-transmitted diseases such as Mayaro virus [60] , Ross River virus [61] or Usutu virus [62] once transportability is deemed plausible.
