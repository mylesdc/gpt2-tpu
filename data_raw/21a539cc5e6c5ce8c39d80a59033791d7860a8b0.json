PCV-2 are small single-stranded circular DNA viruses clustered into two main genogroups: PCV-2a and PCV-2b. Each genogroup present a specific highly-conserved motif of six amino acids (between amino acids 86 and 91) in the PCV-2 capsid protein. The aim of this study was to verify whether the motif located in the capsid protein and specific to each PCV-2 genogroup contributes to virulence. Two parental DNA clones, PCV-2a and PCV-2b, were constructed as well as two mutants DNA clones, PCV-2a/motif 2b and PCV-2b/motif 2a by exchanging the capsid motif of each genogroup. The four DNA clones were characterized in vitro as well as in vivo. Cells transfected by the four DNA clones produced infectious viruses. In specific-pathogen-free piglets transfected by the four infectious DNA clones, PCV-2b/motif 2a virulence was not attenuated while the PCV-2a/motif 2b virulence was drastically reduced compared to their parent virulence. These results suggest that the amino acids between positions 86 and 91 of the capsid protein are determinant for the virulence of isolates. However, the environment of this motif seems also involved.",

            "text": "The first porcine circovirus (PCV) was discovered in a pig kidney cell line (PK15 ATCC-CCL33) and was called porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1) [1] . Experimental infections have shown that PCV-1 is non-pathogenic for pigs [2] . In the 1990s, a new disease called post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) emerged in Europe and North America. PMWS-affected animals exhibit growth retardation, pallor and dyspnea. At necropsy, lymph nodes are enlarged and the main histological lesions are lymphocyte depletion with histiocytic inflammatory infiltration of lymphoid tissues [3] . A new circovirus was identified from diseased pigs and was named porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) [4] . Now PCV-2 is recognized as the etiological agent of PMWS and is associated with several diseases designated by the abbreviation PCVD (porcine circovirus-associated diseases) [3] . To diagnose typical PMWS, specific clinical signs and lesions have to be observed together with the detection of PCV-2 antigen or nucleic acid in the lesions [5] . Pigs infected experimentally often developed sub-clinical infection and typical PMWS is hard to reproduce. Most experimental models used PCV-2 infection combined with co-factors such as bacteria, virus or immunostimulation to increase the severity of the clinical signs and the incidence of PMWS [3] . Hence, to qualify the PCV-2 virulence, the virulence definition described by Casadevall et al. can be used [6] . The virulence definition considered lesions and symptoms but also which mechanism or step of viral life cycle is implicated in the expression of virulence as ability to infect the host or ability to replicate.",

Their genome is a circular, single-stranded DNA molecule of 1767 or 1768 bases encoding three major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 codes for the Rep and Rep' proteins implicated in the replication of the PCV-2 DNA [7] . ORF2 codes for the capsid protein (Cap) which is the only structural protein [8] and ORF3 for a protein possibly involved in apoptosis mechanism [9] . Molecular epidemiology studies allowed separating PCV-2 isolates into two main genogroups: PCV-2a and PCV-2b [10, 11] . PCV-2 isolates from each of the two major genogroups had a motif, located between amino acids 86 to 91, strongly specific and conserved in their capsid proteins [10] . In 2005, a PCVD outbreak occurred in North America. This event was concomitant with the emergence of isolates of PCV-2b genogroup [12] , which happened also in some European countries including Switzerland [13] and in Spain [14] . PCV-2b emergence seemed to be correlated to PMWS outbreak, giving rise to the assumption that the genogroup PCV-2b was more virulent than the PCV-2a one. Nevertheless, no link was clearly established between the genogroup and virulence of isolates, because same isolates were detected in PMWS-affected and non-affected herds in France [15] .",

In vitro, capsid proteins were detected in cells transfected by the four constructions 24 h post-transfection, providing evidence that the introduced mutations did not affect protein expression as described previously [27, 28] . Furthermore, capsid proteins were also produced by cells infected with the transfection supernatants.

The two mutant clones induced sub-clinical infection. Some of the parameters examined to define PCV-2 virulence mechanism (genomic loads in serum and in organs) were weakened in piglets inoculated with the PCV-2b/ motif 2a mutant in comparison to those inoculated with the PCV-2b clone. This mutant clone was infectious in vivo and allowed the development of a PCV-2 immunogenic response. Similarly, the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant clone presented a decrease in virulence relative to its parent, the PCV-2a clone. However, the introduction of the capsid motif specific to the potentially more virulent PCV-2b genogroup did not confer higher virulence properties to the recipient PCV-2a virus. On the contrary, slight genomic loads and infectious titers in organs were revealed, explaining that no seroconversion, no genome copies in the serum and no viral antigens in the lesions were detected for PCV-2a/motif 2b inoculated group. Macroscopic lesions were also less severe in pigs transfected with this mutant than in those transfected by the PCV-2a parental clone. All these results showed that the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant clone had a virulence attenuated compared to its parent, the PCV-2a clone.",

The genomic loads were lower in the organs of the pigs transfected with the mutant clones than those of the pigs transfected with the parental clones and in the organs of the PCV-2a transfected pigs compared to those transfected with PCV-2b. This demonstrated that the replication efficiency could be different between parental strains and between both parental clones and mutants. One hypothesis to explain this is a differential regulation of the replication step. It was previously showed that the regulation of replication was controlled by the Rep and its own promoter for porcine circovirus [7] . In our study, the Rep and Rep' proteins of the two parental clones had only one amino acid difference. This amino acid was outside of the three motives implicated in the Rep functions [34, 35] and hence might not explain a difference in replication. Nevertheless, in some Geminiviruses, the absence or inactivation of the Cap protein led to reduced accumulation of single-stranded DNA associated with an increase in the level of doublestranded DNA replicative forms [36, 37] . It has been also reported that the Cap protein of the mung bean yellow mosaic India virus, a geminivirus, might have a role in controlling the viral replication and thus the copy number of viral DNA. Indeed, the interaction of its Cap and Rep proteins inhibited the nicking and closing function of the Rep and not the Rep ATPase activity [38] .",

In this case, the PCV-2a Cap protein might lead to the most effective control of replication. For PCV-2b, the Cap protein with less interaction with the Rep could result to enhanced replication and accumulation of doublestranded DNA, like for the Geminiviruses [37] . In the same way, the introduction of the PCV-2a motif in the PCV-2b backbone (PCV-2b/motif 2a clone) induced a decrease of viral DNA in organs compared to the PCV-2b and PCV-2a groups. This suggests that the motif specific of genogroup may be involved in the control of replication. However, on the other hand, the introduction of PCV-2b motif in the PCV-2a backbone (PCV-2a/motif 2b group) led to a decrease of genome copies in organs compared to the PCV-2a but also to a decrease of the produced infectious particles. These latter results showed that the genogroup motif could be involved in the replication regulation but not solely. In this study, the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant presented an attenuation of virulence compared to its parent the PCV-2a. The swap of the genogroup motif i.e. four amino acids mutated in PCV-2a, might have generated a defective virus. But the opposite with the introduction of 4 mutations in the PCV-2b capsid protein did not cause the same effect. It has been shown for PCV-2a that only two amino acid mutations in the capsid protein induced virulence attenuation [32] . Consequently, we can assume that the capsid protein of PCV-2 does not support a lot of variation. The genogroup motif is an important determinant for characteristics and virulence of isolates. The results of the two mutants of this study demonstrated that the capsid background of this motif is also strongly implicated in these mechanisms. Comparison of the capsid protein sequence of the two parental strains and of the two mutants. Differences in amino acids between the two parental isolates are indicated in bold and underlined. The genogroup motif is highlighted in grey. Asterisk indicated the six amino acid difference between two PCV-2 isolates showing difference in virulence [31] and the dot the two mutations responsible for attenuation by Fenaux et al. [31] .",
