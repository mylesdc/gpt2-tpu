Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans.",

EBOV belongs to the family Filoviridae and causes severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates 1-3 . The mechanism of pathogenesis of EBOV infection remains mostly unknown, making it paramount to understand the mechanism of infection, develop effective therapies and solve the biological questions why and how such virulent viral disease gave rise.

GP1 has a mucin-like motif, highly modified with N-and O-glycans, and GP2 has a transmembrane region tethering the GP1-GP2 complex on the viral surface 2,3 . During the course of infection, GPs are apparently involved in viral attachment and fusion of viral envelope with host membranes, leading to the subsequent entry into cells 2,5,6 . Recent findings that GP-specific neutralizing antibodies and pseudosaccharides, which could be a ligand of lectins expressed on host cell surfaces, were reported to protect experimental animals from lethal EBOV infection also support the notion that GPs function as crucial elements in determining the degree of infection 7-10 . Additionally, the mucin-like domain of ZEBOV GP1 was previously reported to be essential to the infectivity of ZEBOV 11 . C-Type lectins on myeloid and other cells were previously reported to act as entry sites for EBOV through their interaction with GPs [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . As examples, hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was reported to interact with N-glycans promoting viral entry into hepatocytes 14 , and dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3)-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN-related receptor (DC-SIGNR) were shown to bind high mannose-type N-glycans to promote entry into dendritic cells 12, 13, 16, 17 . Endothelial LSECtin (liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin) recognizes N-glycans and enhances viral infection 15 . We previously showed that K562 cells became susceptible to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus that lacks native G protein (VSV\u0394G*, hereafter described as VSV) 5 pseudotyped with EBOV GPs when macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301) was expressed 18 .

To this end, we prepared pseudotyped viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) 19,20 with ZEBOV GP (ZGP), REBOV GP (RGP), or chimeric GPs using HEK293T cells and compared these GPs with respect to: (1) their binding to recombinant MGL/CD301, (2) the roles of N-glycans and O-glycans of GPs on the binding to recombinant MGL/CD301, and (3) the structures of N-glycans present on the GPs. Our exhaustive structural analysis demonstrated that RGP's N-glycans are more extended than ZGP's N-glycans. When N-glycans were removed from GPs, the difference in the binding capacity to MGL/CD301 observed between RGP and ZGP diminished. It is likely that preferential binding of MGL/CD301 to O-glycans on GPs is interfered by the presence of extended N-glycans. By preparing chimeric GPs between RGP and ZGP, we found that the structural characteristics of RGP and ZGP were biosynthetically determined by a surprisingly short stretch of amino acid residues irrelevant to major glycosylation sites. Our results clearly showed that this short stretch of amino acid residues of GP controls the extension of N-glycans of the entire GP and, in turn, the degree of viral infectivity by modulating the interaction of GPs with MGL/CD301.",

Among several C-type lectins expressed on the surfaces of dendritic cells and macrophages, a predominant role was predicted for MGL/CD301 based on our previous findings showing that infection of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP was significantly enhanced in K562 cells expressing MGL/CD301 (K562-MGL/CD301 cells) 18 . We report here that a specific blocking monoclonal antibody against MGL/CD301, mAb MLD-1 21 , significantly reduced the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP or RGP in human monocyte-derived immature DCs. As shown in Fig. 1a , these pseudotyped viruses infected human monocyte-derived immature DCs, with VSV pseudotyped with RGP being less infective than VSV pseudotyped with ZGP. Pre-incubation of immature DCs with mAb MLD-1 reduced the infection rate to ~40% compared to an isotype control antibody (Fig. 1a) . According to these results, we judged MGL/CD301 on the surface of immature DCs plays a predominant role in infection of these cells with EBOV. The results also indicate that structural characteristics of EBOV GPs determine the differential viral infectivity, because the only difference between VSV pseudotyped with RGP and VSV pseudotyped with ZGP lies in the structures of their GPs. Therefore, we focused on MGL/CD301 and GPs to explore the molecular basis of the differential infectivity between REBOV and ZEBOV.",

MGL/CD301-mediated infection of VSV pseudotyped with GPs (derived from ZEBOV, Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) and REBOV) was examined using K562-MGL/CD301 cells. All of the pseudotyped viruses infected K562-MGL/CD301 cells more efficiently than K562-mock cells (Fig. 1b) . VSV pseudotyped with ZGP or SEBOV GP (SGP) showed significantly higher infectivity to cells expressing MGL/CD301 than VSV pseudotyped with RGP (Fig. 1b) . Again, these results strongly suggest that the structural features of GPs determine the degree of the infection through their binding to MGL/CD301. To investigate this correlation further, the binding of recombinant MGL/CD301 to electrophoretically separated viral proteins of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP, ZGP lacking the mucin-like domain (\u0394muc), SGP, or RGP was compared by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1c , MGL/CD301 could bind to ZGP/SGP much stronger than ZGP \u0394muc/RGP, whereas similar differences were not detected with the binding of anti-GP1 mAb 42/3.7, which recognizes a common epitope in RGP and ZGP 22 19, 23, 24 . Similar to the results of the immunoblotting analysis with MGL/CD301 or mAb 42/3.7 using VSV pseudotyped with GPs, the binding of MGL/CD301 to VLP-ZGP was higher than to VLP-RGP or VLP-ZGP\u0394muc (Fig. 1d) . Taken together, the binding intensity of MGL/CD301 to GPs from VLPs correlated with the infectivity of pseudotyped viruses.",

            "text": "The primary amino acid sequence of the so-called mucin-like domain of ZGP is not responsible for the differential infectivity and MGL/CD301 binding. The EBOV GP mucin-like domain (amino acid residues 311-462 of GP1) is rich in both N-and O-glycans 3 . The primary amino acid sequences of this domain are distinct between ZGP and RGP. The amino acid sequence homology between full-length ZGP and RGP is 58.1%, whereas that of the mucin-like domain is only 16.7% (see Fig. S1 for amino acid sequences). Thus, we thought that the primary amino acid sequence of the mucin-like domain determines the differential viral infectivity and differential MGL/CD301 binding. To test this hypothesis, we generated both VSV and VLP bearing a chimeric GP in which the mucin-like domain of ZGP was replaced with that of RGP. Unexpectedly, the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with the chimeric GP was similar to that of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP in K562-MGL/CD301 cells ( Fig. 2a; Z311-462R ). Also, the binding of MGL/CD301 to chimeric GP from VLP was similar to that of ZGP from VLP ( Fig. 2b; Z311-462R ). These results indicate that the primary structure of the mucin-like domain is not responsible for the differences in MGL/CD301-mediated infectivity or the differential binding capacity to MGL/CD301 between ZGP and RGP. We could not test chimeric RGP carrying the mucin-like domain of ZGP, because the production of both pseudotyped VSV and VLP containing this domain was inefficient for unknown reasons, although the presence of this glycoprotein was confirmed on the cell surface of transfected HEK293T cells. Considering that Ser/Thr residues, representing potential O-glycosylation sites, are also present outside of the mucin-like domain, various lengths of polypeptide stretches around the mucin-like domain of ZGP were replaced with the corresponding region of RGP based on amino-acid sequence homology (Fig. 2a) . Such chimeric GPs were examined for viral infectivity in K562-MGL/CD301 cells and MGL/ CD301's binding capacity to GPs. Even when 276 amino acids (amino acids 187 to 462) including the mucin-like domain (151 amino acids) of ZGP were replaced with the corresponding region of RGP, the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with these chimeric GPs was very similar to that of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP (Fig. 2a) . Similarly, Figure 1 . A positive correlation was found between the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with EBOV GPs and MGL/CD301 binding to the GPs. (a) Blockade of infection of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP or RGP to monocytederived dendritic cells by a monoclonal antibody specific for MGL1/CD301 (mAb MLD-1). In this calculation, the number of infected cells with VSV pseudotyped with ZGP treated with mouse IgG1 was set to 100%, and each relative infectivity was compared by the ratio to this value. For statistical analysis, Student's t-test was performed. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. (b) Effect of MGL/CD301 expression on the infection of VSV pseudotyped with ZGP, SGP, or RGP. All experiments were performed 3 times, and representative results are shown. In this calculation, the number of infected K562-mock cells with VSV pseudotyped with ZGP, RGP, or SGP was set to 100%, respectively, and the relative infectivity of K562-MGL/CD301 was shown by the ratio to this value. For statistical analysis, Student's t-test was performed. the binding capacity of MGL/CD301 to these chimeric GPs was almost identical to the binding capacity to ZGP (Fig. 2b) . However, to our surprise, replacement of amino acid residues 1-462 or 33-462 from ZGP into RGP dramatically reduced both the infectivity to K562-MGL/CD301 cells and the binding capacity to MGL/CD301 compared to ZGP (Fig. 2a,b) . These results made us hypothesize that the amino acid residues 33-186 of GP might regulate the infectivity to K562-MGL/CD301 cells and the binding capacity to MGL/CD301. The amino acid residues 33-50 of ZGP and RGP are critical to the differential infectivity and the differential MGL/CD301 binding between ZEBOV and REBOV. To further investigate the role of amino acid residues 33-186 of GP on viral infectivity and binding capacity to MGL/CD301, we generated VSVs pseudotyped with chimeric ZGP/RGP and VLPs, both containing the swapped 33-186 amino acid residues of RGP/ZGP (Fig. 3a) . Then, we examined the viral infectivity in K562-MGL/CD301 cells and the binding capacity to MGL/CD301. The infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with chimeric ZGP (ZGP 33-186 swapped into RGP) was dramatically reduced compared to ZGP ( Fig. 3a ; Z33-186R). Similarly, the binding capacity of MGL/CD301 to the chimeric GP was dramatically reduced compared to ZGP (Fig. 3b ,c; Z33-186R). On the contrary, the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with chimeric RGP (RGP 33-186 swapped into ZGP), and the binding capacity of MGL/ CD301 to chimeric RGP were dramatically increased compared to RGP (Fig. 3a-c; R33-186Z ). These results suggest that the residues 33-186 of GP have a pivotal role in determining the differential infectivity and the differential binding to MGL/CD301 between ZEBOV and REBOV. To further investigate this issue, we focused on residues 33-50, because among residues 33-186 the homology of residues 33-50 is relatively low between ZGP and RGP. By swapping residues 33-50 of ZGP into RGP, both the infectivity to K562-MGL/CD301 cells and the binding capacity to MGL/CD301 were dramatically reduced to the level of RGP (Fig. 3a -c; Z33-50R). As we expected, the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with chimeric GP containing swapped residues 33-50 from RGP to ZGP was significantly greater than that of VSV pseudotyped with RGP ( Fig. 3a; R33-50Z) . Similarly, the binding capacity of MGL/CD301 to the chimeric GPs was dramatically increased compared with RGP ( Fig. 3b ,c; R33-50Z). These results strongly suggest that the amino acid residues 33-50 near the N-terminus of GP are responsible for the biosynthesis of the GP structure that determines the interactions with MGL/CD301 and, in turn, viral infectivity in K562-MGL/CD301 cells.",

The equations used for this calculation were as follow; Relative ratio of MGL/CD301 to mAb 42/3.7 of ZGP = ZGP with PNGase F treatment/ZGP without PNGase F treatment x 100 (%), Relative ratio of MGL/ CD301 to mAb 42/3.7 of RGP = RGP with PNGase F treatment/RGP without PNGase F treatment x 100 (%). For confirmed by the loss of PHA-L 4 binding and by an alteration in electrophoretic migration distance. As shown in Fig. 3d ,e, the binding of MGL/CD301 to ZGP did not change after PNGase F treatment. In contrast, the binding of MGL/CD301 to RGP increased after PNGase F treatment. These results suggest that the binding of MGL/ CD301 to GPs was mediated by O-glycans not by N-glycans. Additionally, the binding of MGL/CD301 to ZGP/ RGP became almost identical after PNGase F treatment, suggesting that N-glycans in RGP interfered with the interaction between MGL/CD301 and RGP. RGP has more extended N-glycans than ZGP, and the extended N-glycans seem to inhibit the interaction between GP and MGL/CD301. To compare the structural features of N-glycans present on RGP and ZGP, the structures of N-glycans released from RGP, ZGP, and chimeric GPs were analyzed. GPs were immunoprecipitated from dissolved VLPs using mAb 42/3.7. Immunoprecipitated GPs were subjected to in-gel PNGase F digestion followed by glycoblotting 25 and MALDI-TOF MS. Typical MS spectra of ZGP and RGP are shown in Fig. 4a (see Fig. S2 for other GPs), and the structural features estimated from the mass numbers and TOF/TOF analysis are shown in Fig. 4a (only a part of the complex type N-glycans are shown in symbols). The complete estimated compositions of N-glycans observed in MS analyses are shown in Table 1 . The structures of the detected N-glycans were similar between RGP and ZGP with about 90% of them being complex-type N-glycans (Fig. 4b) . In this calculation, we analyzed the MS peak area of all detected N-glycans (Table 1 ) and defined their sum as 100%. Based on the results of our MS analyses, we then focused on complex-type N-glycans on GPs. Comparison of the extension pattern of complex-type N-glycans between RGP and ZGP revealed that there were more extended complex-type N-glycans on RGP than ZGP (Fig. 4c) . At the same time, the amount of non-extended complex-type N-glycans (agalacto-type glycans) in RGP decreased (Fig. 4c) . For this comparison, we defined glycan 10, 14, 16, 22, 25, and 31 in Table 1 as non-extended complex-type N-glycans (i.e. agalacto-type N-glycans; N-glycans, which have only N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues at the non-reducing terminal) and we difined galactosylated and sialylated N-glycans (such as glycan 20, 27, 44, 55 in Table 1 in case of bi-antennary N-glycans) as extended complex-type N-glycans (i.e. extended-type N-glycans). When N-glycans are maturated/elongated, their structures are known to become bulky and the steric hindrance around O-glycans are likely to increase. Therefore, we hypothesized that the steric hindrance of extended N-glycans of RGP inhibit the interaction between GP and MGL/CD301, and that N-terminal amino acid residues 33-50 or 33-186 of GP regulate the extension of N-glycans.",

Those C-Type lectins, which were previously reported, have diverse carbohydrate specificities, for instance, DC-SIGN preferentially binds to mannose (Man). It is likely that C-type lectins with various carbohydrate specificities [29] [30] [31] [32] act in concert to facilitate the attachment and the entry of EBOV into DCs. MGL/CD301 seems to play predominant roles among these lectins and non-lectin receptors, because the MGL/CD301 blocking monoclonal antibody blocked the infection of pseudotyped viruses into human immature DCs by more than 60% (Fig. 1a) .",

They also claimed that several key amino-acid residues are crucial to the protein folding 33 . However, the importance of glycosylation of GP1 was not explored in their study. Marzi and co-workers reported that the signal sequence of GP (N-terminal 1-32 amino acid residues) affected the GP glycosylation that resulted in an enhancement of DC-SIGN/R-mediated viral infection 34 . They showed that high-mannose type glycosylation of SGP increased when the signal peptide of SGP was replaced with that of ZGP, though they did not study the glycan structures attached to GPs. Our structural analyses by MS revealed that N-glycans of RGP are more extended than those of ZGP, even though these GPs were prepared in the same cell line (Fig. 4c) . The extension patterns apparently affect the interaction with MGL/CD301and the binding of MGL/CD301 to RGP increased to a level to that to ZGP after the removal of N-glycans (Fig. 3d,e) . The binding of MGL/CD301 to RGP was also increased when their extended glycans were trimmed using glycosidases (Fig. 5b) . These results support that the structures of N-glycans of GPs affect the interaction between MGL/CD301 and GPs. More extended N-glycans of RGP seem to lower the binding to MGL/CD301, which preferentially binds O-glycans, and to decrease the capacity of GPs to mediate the infection of DCs and macrophages. N-glycans of ZGP do not seem to have such capacity (Fig. 3d,e) .",

As far as we examined, a stretch of 18 amino acid residues near the amino terminus of the GP (33-50) seemed to play a key role. We also showed that the same stretch of amino acid residues plays an important role in the regulation of the differential N-glycan extension between RGP and ZGP. The lectin-binding potential and glycan extension pattern of ZGP and RGP were reversed when the N-terminal 33-50 (or 33-186) amino acid residues of the GPs were swapped (Figs 3a, 4d) . These results strongly suggest that there is an oligopeptide motif that can control N-glycan extension. How this extension is controlled, however, remains to be determined. It is also worthwhile to mention that, in contrast to a previous report 34 , the signal sequence (1-32 amino acid residues) of GP did not seem to be involved in this phenomenon. We did not observe any effect of the signal sequence on the differential infectivity of pseudotyped viruses nor MGL/CD301 binding between REBOV and ZEBOV GPs (Fig. 2 , ZGP vs Z33-462R, or Z1-462R vs Z33-462R).",

            "text": "Regarding the potential mechanism that controls N-glycan extension, we assumed that intracellular localization, trafficking speed, or trafficking pathway of the GP might be influenced by this peptide motif. However, as far as we examined, the biosynthetic rate and the intracellular localization of GP did not seem to be affected. Pulse-chase experiments on 35 S-Methionine incorporation revealed almost identical biosynthetic rates between RGP and ZGP (Fig. S3a) . The intracellular localizations of RGP and ZGP were very similar (Fig. S3b) . We attempted to prepare VSV pseutotyped with RGP/ZGP lacking amino acid residues 33-50 (RGP\u039433-50, ZGP\u039433-50) and VLPs bearing RGP\u039433-50/ZGP\u039433-50 to confirm the importance of this oligopeptide motif. The expression of those GPs on VSV pseudotyped viruses or VLPs were confirmed by immunoblotting using mAb 42/3.7 (Fig. S6a,b) , however, infectious viruses were not obtained (Fig. 6c) for unknown reasons. The band patterns of RGP\u039433-50 and ZGP\u039433-50 from VLPs were different from those of other GPs (Fig. S6b) suggesting that the amino acid residue 33rd through 50th of GP affect some processing of GPs. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which this peptide sequence regulates N-glycan extension.",

However, in contrast to our study, they analyzed recombinant GPs from the lysates of 293 T cells expressing GPs, while our study was on GPs from VLPs which closely represent viral particles. Furthermore, they did not analyze RGP which represent the molecular characteristics of a poorly infectious variant. Our results on the N-glycan structures, however, were consistent with their results in that most of the N-glycans were fucosylated and asialo-type glycans (Fig. S4) 35 . According to their results, ZGP and SGP contained lower amounts of O-glycans with sialic acid than GPs of Bundibugyo/Ivory Coast. Further studies are necessary to prove or disprove the hypothesis that decreased sialylations contribute to elevated interactions of these GPs with MGL/CD301. Previous reports showed that GP was useful as a therapeutic target for EBOV infection. GP-specific neutralizing antibodies protect experimental animals from lethal EBOV infection. Some antibodies were able to protect mice completely and guinea pigs partially 8, 10 . Another neutralizing antibody was effective for guinea pigs but not for non-human primates 36, 37 . Recently, several neutralizing antibodies that can protect macaques from lethal EBOV infection were also reported [38] [39] [40] . As shown in the present report, by enhancing N-glycan extension in cells infected with EBOV, infectivity of the virus produced by these cells may be reduced. Furthermore, structural analysis of GPs with extended N-glycans might assist to identify an epitope that could be used as a target of an effective therapeutic antibody against EBOV. Blockade of the infection should also be achieved by interfering with the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301. The present study will also contribute to understand novel regulatory mechanisms of glycosylation in cells during infection.",
