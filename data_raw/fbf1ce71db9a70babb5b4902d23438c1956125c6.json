            "text": "Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002, resulting in roughly 8000 cases worldwide and 10% mortality. The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist and the likelihood of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60-hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five chemical suppressors of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknown activity of PLP, or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that modifies or bypasses PLP function in yeast and mammalian cells.",

The basis for the screen is that forced expression of PLP in S. cerevisiae causes a pronounced slow growth phenotype. Using this finding we screened a small molecule library for compounds that specifically reversed the PLP-induced slow growth phenotype. These compounds were then tested in cell culture models for efficacy against SARS-CoV replication, as well as the known enzymatic functions of PLP. Here we report that of 5 compounds that reversed the slow growth phenotype in yeast; 1 compound, NSC158362, also significantly blocked SARS-CoV replication in vitro with an EC50 ,1 mM. This effect was specific for SARS-CoV replication because no effect on influenza virus replication was observed with up to 50 mM of the inhibitory compound. A second compound, NSC158011, was able to inhibit PLP-dependent protease activity in a cell culture assay but this effect did not appear strong enough to block virus replication. Interestingly, NSC158362 failed to block the protease, deubiquitinase or anti-IFN activities of PLP. This suggests that its target is either a novel activity of PLP or is a cellular protein that regulates PLP function in infected cells, thus representing new avenues of therapeutic intervention for SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Previously we reported that expression of the influenza virus NS1 protein in yeast resulted in a slow growth phenotype that could be used to screen for specific small molecule antagonists of NS1 [16] . We reasoned that expression of SARS-CoV proteins in yeast may modulate cellular processes including signaling pathways, as they do in mammalian cells, allowing for a genetic system to analyze their function and the capability to identify compounds that alter that function. We focused on the PLP protease domain of the viral nsp3 protein because of its requirement in virus infection [17] . Sequences corresponding to the PLP domain were cloned into a plasmid containing the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter for controlled expression in S. cerevisiae. The plasmid was transformed into a modified strain of S. cerevisiae that carries disrupted alleles for two genes that control drug efflux, PDR1 and PDR3, thus allowing for the efficient retention of small molecules [16] . Shown in Figure 1A is a galactose induction experiment of the PLP expressing strain demonstrating increasing induction with increasing galactose concentration. High-level expression of PLP was observed with as little as 0.1% galactose, and 2% galactose was chosen for further studies. We next analyzed the effect of PLP expression on yeast growth in liquid media. Growth in medium containing glucose, which represses GAL1-driven expression, resulted in both the control and PLP strains growing equally well, as expected (data not shown). Growth in galactose-containing medium was performed over a 60 hour time course and the results are shown in Figure 1B . There was a clear growth inhibition due to expression of PLP, with the maximal differential between control and PLP strains occurring between 30 and 50 hours after initiating growth in galactose-containing medium. Screen for chemical suppressors of the PLP-induced slow-growth phenotype Cells from an overnight culture were plated in a 96-well format at 5610 5 cells/ml in 100 ml of galactose-containing medium in the presence of 50 mM of each test compound or 1% DMSO as control. Approximately 2,000 compounds from the NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) Diversity Set library (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/index.html) were screened manually. Cell growth was monitored by optical density (OD) over the course of 60 hours. Hits were identified as those producing a 1.3 fold or greater increase in OD compared to the DMSO control. Compounds positively affecting yeast growth were tested for reproducibility using independent samples of each compound obtained from the DTP. Five compounds demonstrated reproducible activity and their effects on growth of the PLP strain are shown in Figure 2A . The structures of the five compounds are presented in Figure 2B .",

We have developed a novel screen for antiviral compounds that is rapid, direct and does not rely on previous knowledge of a viral protein's function. The yeast based screen described here was used to identify an antiviral compound directed against the SARS-CoV papain-like protease.

It could also be acting at the cell surface in a way that triggers a modulation of the PLP-induced signaling pathway.

Interestingly, despite a lack of antiviral activity, compound NSC158011 diminished PLP-dependent protease activity in a cell culture assay ( Figure 6A ). Since the effect on protease activity was only partial, we conclude that the effect was not strong enough to lead to a diminution of virus replication. The precise effect of NSC158011 on protease activity could be due to several factors. These include (1) direct inhibition of the protease activity (2) inhibition of a cellular protein whose function is required for PLP activity in cells or (3) triggering the degradation of PLP by direct binding or other mechanisms. With the exception of NSC158011's effect on protease activity, our assays showed that none of the compounds had an effect on PLP's known enzymatic activities. We hypothesize that this compound is either affecting an unidentified activity of PLP or that it acts at the level of a cellular protein that modifies or bypasses the function of PLP in cells.

Since knowledge of the function of the viral protein is not required in order to perform this type of small molecule screen, it can be scaled to any size virus and rapidly initiated once the viral sequence is known of a pathogen, potentially leading to the direct identification of lead compounds for further adaptation and testing in vivo.",

It was derived by tetrad dissection from two parent strains that had been modified by one step gene replacements. The pdr1::KanMX4 was constructed in BY4741 (MATa his3D1 leu2D0 met15D0 ura3D0) and the pdr3:KanMX4 was constructed in BY4742 (MATa his3D1 leu2D0 met15D0 ura3D0). PCR-mediated one-step gene replacements, matings and tetrad dissections were performed as described [22] . Strains 9526-6-2-pRS416 and 9526-6-2/pRS416/ PLP/HA were generated by transformation of 9526-6-2 with plasmids pRS416 and pRS416/PLP/HA, respectively, and were maintained on synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking uracil. For growth experiments and library screening, a single transformed colony was grown overnight and the cell number determined using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter Corporation). The cells were diluted to 5610 5 cells/ml in SC lacking uracil and containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose. 95 ml of this culture was added to 5 ml of pre-plated test compounds in 96-well plates such that the final drug concentration was 50 mM and the final DMSO concentration was 1%. The Diversity Set library (National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program) was used for the drug screen. It was provided as 10 mM stocks in 100% DMSO. OD 600 readings were taken every 12 hours for 60 hours using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).",
