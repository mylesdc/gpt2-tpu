The aim of this study was to identify protein expression signature or biomarkers that reflect chronic lung damages induced by SM exposure. Methods: Prior to analysis, plasma was fractionated using ethanol precipitation. Using two dimensional SDS-PAGE; fractionated protein profiles of 20 healthy and 20 exposed patients with lung diseases were established. Selected protein spots were successfully identified with MALDI TOF MS/MS. Results: The results show that \u03b11 haptoglobin isoforms were detected in plasma of the all lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Amyloid A1 isoforms was also detected in plasma of the lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Moreover, low molecular weight proteins were enriched in ethanol supernatant compared to ethanol precipitate. Conclusion: Our present results and previous studies suggest that ongoing tissue remodeling is involved in SM exposed lung damage patients. These finding might improve patient care and suitable therapies.",

More than lethality, SM causes debilitating effects that can leave an exposed individual incapacitated for days, months, or years. Lung injury is a common health problem after inhalation, which leads to chronic bronchitis and interstitial lung diseases [1] . The clinical picture of the poisoning is well known from the thousands of victims during World War I and the recent Iran-Iraq conflict. In the latter, sulfur mustard was heavily used and at the present time about 30,000 victims still suffer from late effects of the agent, such as chronic obstructive lung disease, lung fibrosis, recurrent corneal ulcer disease, and chronic conjunctivitis [2] . Late complications of mustard gas exposure and main clinical findings include; chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) [3] [4] [5] . However, Clinical manifestation in lung disorders due to sulfur mustard is different from other lung diseases, due to the fact that mustard lung is not responsive to corticosteroids. There is no common consensus about the pathophysiological basis of chronic pulmonary disease caused by this chemical warfare agent [6] .",

In general, human plasma proteome profiling is challenging. Albumin is present at about 40 mg/ ml and several other proteins are highly abundant including immunoglobulins (IgGs), transferrin and fibrinogen which typically constitute greater than 90% of total protein mass [7] . These abundant proteins may hinder the detection of low-abundant proteins that can be of specific interest in the search for biomarkers of disease [8] . However, it is the low abundant proteins that are most likely to be biologically relevant as the markers of a disease state. For analysis of low-abundant proteins in plasma, many strategies have been developed for the selective removal of albumin and other highabundance proteins. Albumin can be removed by immune affinity columns chromatography [9] , isoelectric trapping [10] , heparin chromatography [11] and peptide affinity chromatography [12] . However, it is well known that albumin and other high-abundance proteins may also act as carrier or transport proteins and thus are likely to bind many species of interest, such as peptide hormones, cytokines, and chemokines.",

As shown in Figure 1 , most of the low molecular weight proteins were enriched in the ethanol supernatant rather than the precipitate. We found that 50% (v/v) ethanol was more efficient in fractionating low molecular weight proteins. To avoid any protein losses from the sample, we used both supernatants and precipitates of these fractions for 2-DE analysis. For the first dimension 24 cm IPG strips with pH values in the range of 4-7 were used. The proteins were resolved in homogeneous 15% acrylamide gels in the second dimension to obtain greater resolution for small proteins. About 300 spots in each colloidal CBB-stained gel can be visualized by ImageMaster software. Representative 2-DE images of plasma profiles from a healthy control for 50% (v/v) ethanol precipitate and ethanol supernatant are shown in Figure 2A and 2B respectively. Comparing the proteomics patterns of these two gels shows that both immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are separated in ethanol precipitate ( Figure 2A ) and albumin is distributed both in ethanol supernatant and precipitate (Figure 2A and 2B) . Moreover, most of the small molecular weight proteins in the range of 15-50 kDa, have significantly (p < 0.05) higher spot volume and intensity in ethanol supernatant rather than precipitate ( Table 2 and Figures. 2A and 2A) . We analyzed the differences in the plasma protein patterns, comparing the gels of the diseased and healthy controls. The analysis of protein patterns of the plasma was focused on those protein spots which showed differences, comparing the patients and the controls. They were compared with Image Master 2-DE software and indicated only protein results in all cases (100%) with the same condition. As shown in Figures 2 B and 2C, twenty six protein spots were subjected to MALDI TOF MS analysis.

As a group, the immunoglobulins represent the second most abundant proteins in the plasma or serum. It has been reported that albumin depletion may also remove some small low copy number proteins [15] . Therefore, in these experiments we used ethanol fractionation and found that this simple and low cost experimental procedure can be used for removing immunoglobulins and part of the albumin. Moreover, using 50% (v/v) fractionation, we showed that the ethanol supernatant contains all the protein spots that were found in the ethanol precipitate and recovers more small MW proteins. We have identified some proteins that could give a novel insight into the pathogenesis of mustard lung. One of the main findings was different isoforms of haptoglobin in the plasma of severe lung disease patients but not in healthy controls. Haptoglobin is present in normal human plasma at a concentration range of 0.3-1.9 mg/ml, accounting for 0.4-2.6% of total plasma protein. Human haptoglobin is an inflammation-inducible plasma protein. It consists of 2 different types of \u03b1 chains and a single type of \u03b2 chain connected by disulfide bridges (\u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b1-\u03b2) giving 3 major phenotypes (Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1, Hp 2-2), the numbers 1 and 2 representing \u03b11 (8.9 kDa) and \u03b12 (16 kDa) chains, respectively. The \u03b2 chain (40 kDa) is heavier than \u03b1 chain and is identical in all Hp types [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Significant difference between the samples were calculated using the Student's t-test and marked by * if p < 0.05, ** if p < 0.01. a. Spot numbers correspond to those in Figures 2A and 2B groups, but \u03b11 chain (spots 21, 22, 23) is only expressed in the patients plasma samples but not in the healthy controls. In our recent study of BAL fluid proteomics patterns in SM exposed patients we also found that haptoglobin isoforms were significantly elevated in moderate and severe lung disease patients compared to mild and healthy controls [13] . Acute-phase proteins are induced shortly after exposure to triggering events such as inflammation, infection, and trauma, and are thought to be part of a general defense-response in injured tissue. But, these patients have been exposed to SM more than 20 years ago. It seems that an ongoing damage is occurring in lung of these patients. A recent proteomic study has also shown that levels of haptoglobin are elevated in BAL fluid in patients with mild asthma, and reported that haptoglobin may play a role in the differentiation of fibroblast progenitor cells, suggesting a novel role for haptoglobin in airway remodeling in patients with asthma [20] . Conversely Nishioka et al. showed that the serum concentration of haptoglobin was decreased during acute exacerbation in asthmatic children [21] . Haptoglobin isoforms and fragments are also elevated in plasma of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients [22] . Haptoglobin plays a crucial role in defense against hemoglobin-induced oxidative stress by a mechanism thought to involve its high-affinity binding with hemoglobin and preventing iron release from hemoglobin. However, it has yet to be shown that haptoglobin itself is an antioxidant molecule [23] . Arredouani et al. [24] further described the role of haptoglobin affecting the immune system, showing that haptoglobin directly affects T-cells and suppress T-helper-cells through down-regulation of cytokine production. We found that Amyloid A1 isoforms only detected in the plasma of severe lung diseases patients but not in healthy controls ( Figure 2B and 2C) . Similar results were reported for SARS patients [22] . Although serum Amyloid A1 is not as commonly used in human medicine as C-reactive protein (CRP), it is more sensitive to acute response than CRP [25, 26] . Serum Amyloid A1 is an acute-phase protein that is induced, like CRP, by inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, that rises in acute exacerbation of COPD [27] . Serum Amyloid A1 is secreted from the liver as the predominant apolipoprotein associated with plasma high density lipoprotein. We postulate that in our SM exposed patients ongoing tissue damage and repair (remodeling) is occurring which leads to an increase in acute phase reactant proteins such as haptoglobin and Amyloid A1.",

CBB stained gels were scanned in transmission scan mode using Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer at a resolution of 600 dots per square inch (dpi). The scanned gels were saved as TIF images for subsequent analysis. Protein spots were detected automatically. Manual spot editing or deleting (of artifacts) was performed when necessary. The spots intensity, volume, or saliency was adjusted in the preview mode using Image master software. Furthermore spots on all gels were visually carefully inspected for inappropriate matching, staining artifacts, or bad spot detection and conserved for analysis. To measure the volume and intensity of protein spots on CBB-stained gels the volume and intensity of each spot was divided by the total volume or intensity of all spots of the same gel. Since this method of normalization produces extremely small values, the result was multiplied by a scaling factor of 100, which produced spot percentage volumes or intensity. Only those spots that were reproducibly and statistically significant (p < 0.05) in intensity or volume were used for analysis.",

Processing of gel plugs, trypsin digestion and MALDI TOF MS/MS analysis using a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Alphalyse, Denmark) and database searching was performed as described previously [13] . The MS and MS/MS spectra were combined and used for a database search using the Mascot software (Matrix science, version 2.2.03) for database searches with the selection of following criteria: Database search program: NRDB1 (6655203 protein sequence), species of origin Homo sapience, peptide ion mass tolerance 60 ppm,, MS/MS tolerance 0.2 Da, peptide cut-off of 25, and digestion by trypsin allowing for no more than one missed cleavage. The accuracy of mass detection was MH+ of 0.01 assuming possibility of modification of cysteine by acrylamide and oxidation of methionine. Proteins identification was based on a combination of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with peptide masses, and several MS/MS spectra of selected peptides in each MALDI MS spectrum. The protein and protein isoforms shown on the identification list is based purely on the human protein database accession that gives the highest Mascot score. To the extent that the different sequence isoforms are represented in individual database accession numbers, these have been considered in the database search. Other modifications and isoforms are not considered in this analysis. The positive protein identification was based on a probability-scoring algorithm (http://www.matrixscience. com) and the 95% confidence level for positive identification was a score = 80",
