We observed that stepwise genetic distance was greatest immediately following initial infection and diminished to a plateau thenafter (Fig. 1) .

We used this gamma function (\u03b1 = 1, \u03b8 = 4, implemented using the function GammaDistribution[1, 4] + 0.18 in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc, 1988) ) in the computer simulation program to evolve sequences according to the phylogenetic tree, which was rooted by using as outgroups sequences obtained from strains found in civet cats (He et al. 2004) . Comparable results were obtained using one-and two-parameter molecular substitution models (Jukes and Cantor, 1969; Kimura, 1980) . Reassortment was unconsidered. The computer simulation program calculated Hamming distances between an hypothetical ancestor and the sequences; paired time points with these distances according to the phylogenetic tree; performed linear regressions; and extrapolated backward to 0 distance, to estimate origin times.

We note that previously published estimates 'redate' inaccurately, to months prior to or weeks following the real-world index case date (He et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2004) or months following the initial outbreak (Zeng et al. 2003) . Those estimates were generated using sequences that were obtained between February and April 2003, whereupon molecular modifi cation had stabilized (Fig. 1) . Adopting a molecular clock assumption might have been valid in those profi cient analyses; however, extrapolating backward on the basis of that constant modification rate-especially using pairwise genetic distances-might have been misleading. We propose that the nonlinear, rapid divergence exhibited by the SARS-CoV immediately after initially infecting humans (t = 0-25, Fig. 1 ) might represent a time period during which the virus 'settled' before becoming 'comfortable' (t \u03fe25, Fig. 1 ) in its new environment. Whether settling constitutes a general phenomenon could be tested with data from entire genomes (i.e. including all genes) and other viruses (e.g. the Avian Infl uenza Virus). In the meanwhile, we recommend subjecting virus sequences to computational, non-molecular clock assumption analyses (e.g. \"relaxed phylogenetics\" in Drummond et al. 2006) to estimate timepoints for critical epidemiological phenomena, like the viral reassortment events associated with the fi rst human SARS-CoV case in 1997 (He et al. 2004 ).",
