            "text": "Lipid rafts (LRs) play crucial roles in complex physiological processes, modulating innate and acquired immune responses to pathogens. The transmembrane C-type lectins human dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its mouse homolog SIGN-R1 are distributed in LRs and expressed on splenic marginal zone (MZ) macrophages. The DC-SIGN-C1q or SIGN-R1-C1q complex could mediate the immunoglobulin (Ig)-independent classical complement pathway against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Precise roles of LRs during this complement pathway are unknown. Here we show that LRs are indispensable for accelerating the DC-SIGN-or SIGN-R1-mediated classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae, thus facilitating rapid clearance of the pathogen. The trimolecular complex of SIGN-R1-C1q-C4 was exclusively enriched in LRs of splenic MZ macrophages and their localization was essential for activating C3 catabolism and enhancing pneumococcal clearance, which were abolished in SIGN-R1-knockout mice. However, DC-SIGN replacement on splenic MZ macrophage's LRs of SIGN-R1-depleted mice reversed these defects. Disruption of LRs dramatically reduced pneumococcal uptake and decomposition. Additionally, DC-SIGN, C1q, C4, and C3 were obviously distributed in splenic LRs of cadavers. Therefore, LRs on splenic SIGN-R1 + or DC-SIGN + macrophages could provide spatially confined and optimal bidirectional platforms, not only for usual intracellular events, for example recognition and phagocytosis of pathogens, but also an unusual extracellular event such as the complement system. These findings improve our understanding of the orchestrated roles of the spleen, unraveling a new innate immune system initiated from splenic MZ LRs, and yielding answers to several long-standing problems, including the need to understand the profound role of LRs in innate immunity, the need to identify how such a small portion of splenic SIGN-R1 + macrophages (<0.05% of splenic macrophages) effectively resist S. pneumoniae, and the need to understand how LRs can promote the protective function of DC-SIGN against S. pneumoniae in the human spleen.",

This system can be activated through classical, soluble mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and alternative pathways 12, 13 . A pivotal step in the complement pathways is assembly of a C3 convertase, which digests C3 to form microbial binding C3 fragments Because C3 fragments 14 , such as C3b, C3bi, and C3d, serve as ligands for complement receptors, their reciprocal binding promotes the uptake and killing of microbes by phagocytes 15 . Thus, the complement system provides a major extracellular defense mechanism against infectious organisms 16 Various immune receptors in LRs, such as Fc receptors 17, 18 , cytokine receptors [19] [20] [21] , B cell receptors 22 , and T cell receptors 23 , increase their binding capacity through clustering 24 and facilitate signaling to favor the clearance of intracellular pathogens 10 . Some innate pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors and transmembrane C-type lectins, translocate to LRs upon stimulation with specific agonists [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , thus demonstrating the importance of this membrane partitioning for the innate immune recognition of various pathogens 3 . In addition, various complement receptors (CR2, CR3, and globular C1q receptor (gC1qR)) 31,32 and complement regulatory proteins (CD46, CD55, and CD59) 33, 34 are distributed in the LRs of immune cells.",

Immunostaining with isotype control IgG for anti-C3 antibodies did not yield a C3 signal ( Supplementary  Fig. S7d) . Moreover, immunoblotting of cadaver spleens for C1q, C4, and C3 revealed expression in human splenic LRs, with predominant expression of C1q and 104-kDa \u03b1C3\u2032 rather than 113-kDa \u03b1C3 (Fig. 7k and Supplementary Fig. S7e ).",

Because the disruption of LRs did not alter the expression levels of both lectins on the respective transfectants, which would lead to normal binding of the organism to the cell surface, the structure of LRs may be more important for the function of both lectins and for removal of S. pneumoniae than previously thought. This (see figure on previous page) Fig. 6 SIGN-R1-mediated C3 activation and opsonization of S. pneumoniae enhances the uptake and decomposition of the bacteria by SIGN-R1 + cells in vitro and in vivo. a Live S. pneumoniae type 14 (Pn14) was incubated with 5% NHS at 37\u00b0C for 30 min in the presence of 10 \u03bcg bovine serum albumin, transferrin (Tfe), or purified SIGN-R1, immunostained for C1q, and analyzed by FACS. b As in a, but 10 \u03bcg Tfe or C1q was used, and organisms were immunostained for C1q, iC3b, or membrane attack complex (MAC). c As in a, but organisms were immunoblotted for C3. d In total, 1 \u00d7 10 8 mitomycin C-treated and PKH26-labeled S. pneumoniae (PKH26-MitC-Pn14) were incubated with CHO transfectants in the presence of 10 \u03bcg C1q or 5% NHS. The binding of organisms to cells was assessed by FACS. e DCEK_SIGN transfectants were incubated with MitC-Pn14 (1 \u00d7 10 6 , 15 h, 37\u00b0C) without or with mouse sera (NMS or C3-or C1q-depleted mouse sera), and cells were immunostained for SIGN-R1 (green) or CPS14 (red), followed by microscopic analysis. Representative cells are shown in the boxes. f CFSE-MitC-Pn14 (1 \u00d7 10 8 , green) were injected intravenously into control, SIGN-R1-KO, or C3-KO mice for 1 h and spleen sections were immunostained for SIGN-R1 (blue) and CPS14 (red).

Scale bars e, 20 \u00b5m; f, 50 \u00b5m Fig. 7 (See legend on next page.) speculation was strongly supported by the following results. First, multimers of DC-SIGN or SIGN-R1 were preformed in LRs of the respective transfectants, and even SIGN-R1 multimers were preformed in splenic LRs. Additionally, DC-SIGN and SIGN-R1 multimers were increased only in LRs following S. pneumoniae challenge in vitro or in vivo, but not in non-LRs. Therefore, LRs could provide a spatially confined and optimal platform for DC-SIGN and SIGN-R1 to facilitate clustering, increase their affinity and specificity to pathogens, and enhance their clearance, thus affecting their innate protective functions 7, 45 .",

SIGN-R1 was exclusively expressed on splenic MZ macrophages 42 and bound directly to C1q or C4 39, 48 . Additionally, there is a potential interaction between C1q and C4 49, 50 .

Supporting this possibility, C3, particularly C3\u03b1, was most enriched in splenic LRs, despite having lowest expression in the spleen among examined mouse tissues. Therefore, splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + LRs may be optimized to activate C3, although the C3 distribution was independent of the existence of SIGN-R1, probably due to covalent fixation of C3 fragments on other splenic cells 57 . Because the complement system should be tightly controlled under physiological conditions to prevent significant damage to self-tissues, enrichment of SIGN-R1, C1q, C4, and C3 in splenic MZ SIGN-R1 + LRs could also precisely regulate complement activation in splenic MZs; indeed, nascent C3b and C4 regulate C1 activation in concert with C3 under normal conditions 58 .",

A representative cell is shown in the box. b After DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants were incubated with MitC-Pn14 (1 \u00d7 10 6 , 1 h, 37\u00b0C), lysates were fractionated with sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and fractions of LRs were immunoblotted for DC-SIGN, flotilin-1, or caveolin-1. c DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were injected intravenously with CFSE-labeled MitC-Pn14 (green; 1 \u00d7 10 8 , 15 min or 1 h), and splenic sections were immunostained for DC-SIGN (red). d As in b, but spleens of DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were used after intravenous injection of live S. pneumoniae (1 \u00d7 10 8 , 1 h). e (Left) Wild-type or DCEK transfectants were incubated with 5 \u03bcg endotoxin-free ovalbumin (efOVA), human C1q, or 3% sera (NMS, NHS, or C1q-depleted human serum) in TC buffer for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and lysates were immunoblotted for C1q. (Right) Wild-type or DCEK_DC-SIGN transfectants were incubated with 3% NMS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and immunostained for C1q, followed by microscopic analysis. Representative areas are highlighted from low-power images in Figure S7a . f Wild-type or DCEK transfectants were incubated with 5% NMS for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, immunostained for C4 without permeabilization, and analyzed by FACS. g Empty vector or DC-SIGN-transfected HEK293T cells were incubated without or with MitC-Pn14 (1 \u00d7 10 7 ) in the absence or presence of 5% NHS for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, and cell lysates were immunoblotted for DC-SIGN, C1q, C4, and \u03b2-actin. h As in d, but DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were used, and splenic fractions were immunoblotted for C1q or C4. i Control, SIGN-R1 TKO , and DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were injected intravenously with Pn14 (1 \u00d7 10 8 ), and their sera were collected at 0, 15, 30, or 60 min and immunoblotted for C3. j As in c, but control, SIGN-R1 KO, SIGN-R1 TKO , and DC-SIGN BMT /SIGN-R1 TKO mice were intravenously injected for 15 min. Splenic sections were immunostained for C3 (red) and SIGN-R1 (green) or C3 (red) and DC-SIGN (green). Representative areas are highlighted from low-power images in Figure S7b . k As in h, but spleens of cadavers were used and immunoblotted for C1q, C4, and C3.

Scale bars a, e, 20 \u00b5m; c, 250 \u00b5m; j, 50 \u00b5m In particular, the DC-SIGN-C1q complex could also mediate a classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae in the spleen, representing a potential protection mechanism in the human spleen 24 . Indeed, the replaced DC-SIGN on splenic MZs of DC-SIGN BMT / SIGN-R1 TKO mice completely rescued the pneumococcal capture, the sequential activation and deposition of C3 against S. pneumoniae in splenic MZs, which was likely to be related to the DC-SIGN-induced complex of mouse C1q and C4. Previous studies have shown that recruitment of DC-SIGN into LRs with binding to viral glycoproteins or the gC1qR 29,31,66 strengthens the possible formation of a tetramolecular complex of glycoproteins/ DC-SIGN/C1q/gC1qR and thus increases binding capacity through the complex 24, 67 . Therefore, similar to SIGN-R1, splenic MZ DC-SIGN + LRs may also provide a favorable microenvironment for the DC-SIGN-mediated classical complement pathway by forming another tetramolecular complex of DC-SIGN, C1q, gC1qR, and C4, finally enhancing sequential C3 activation.",

However, splenic MZ LRs provide bidirectional platforms not only for usual events associated with the intracellular milieu, for example, recognition and phagocytosis of pathogens in vivo, but also unusual events associated with the extracellular milieu, such as the complement system, orchestrating early and complicated host responses to microbial infection. Thus, the spleen could be equipped with the most sensitive system to target various pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae 35, 36 and human immunodeficiency virus-1 37, 38 . These findings can explain how such a small portion of splenic SIGN-R1 + macrophages (<0.05%) helps the spleen to efficiently protect hosts against S. pneumoniae, providing insights into the involvement of LRs in the innate immune system and the roles of DC-SIGN in the human spleen.",

For in vitro C3 processing, 1 \u00d7 10 8 S. pneumoniae were incubated with 5% NHS in TC buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% BSA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The bacteria were washed, mixed, and boiled with 20 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 SDS sample buffer. Bacterial lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal antimouse C3 antibodies. These antibodies detected the components of native C3, \u03b1C3, and \u03b2C3, as well as the fragments of \u03b1C3 (molecular weights in humans: 113 kDa for \u03b1C3, 104 kDa of \u03b1C3\u2032, 63 kDa and 41 kDa for iC3b fragments, and 75 kDa for \u03b2C3; molecular weights in rats: 120 kDa for \u03b1C3, 70 kDa and 43 kDa for iC3b fragments, and 65 kDa for \u03b2C3) that are generated during C3 processing by C3 convertases by immunoblotting analysis. In the steady state, \u03b1C3 and \u03b2C3 are predominant, with a few larger iC3b. With activation, \u03b1C3 and larger iC3b are rapidly processed into smaller fragments, including 43 kDa iC3b, but not \u03b2C3, which serves as a loading control for the immunoblotting analysis, resulting in loss of most of the detectable \u03b1C3 as well as larger iC3b, but accumulation of the smaller iC3b in C3 activation in immunoblotting analysis 70 .",
