Porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) is a newly discovered receptor for F4 fimbriae that binds directly to FaeG adhesin, which is the major subunit of the F4 fimbriae variants F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad. We used overlapping peptide assays to map the APN-FaeG binding sites, which has facilitated in the identifying the APN-binding amino acids that are located in the same region of FaeG variants, thereby limiting the major binding regions of APN to 13 peptides. To determine the core sequence motif, a panel of FaeG peptides with point mutations and FaeG mutants were constructed. Pull-down and binding reactivity assays using piglet intestines determined that the amino acids G159 of F4ab, N209 and L212 of F4ac, and A200 of F4ad were the critical residues for APN binding of FaeG. We further show using ELISA and confocal microscopy assay that amino acids 553-568, and 652-670 of the APN comprise the linear epitope for FaeG binding in all three F4 fimbriae variants.",

F4 + ETEC has three variants, namely, ab, ac, and ad. A comparative analysis of the gene cluster between these three variants show that their differences mainly involve the faeG gene, thereby causing variations in the adhesive properties and specificities of the F4 fimbriae [2, 3] . The major FaeG subunit is an essential component of F4 fimbriae. For instance, oral administration of F4 fimbriae or the FaeG protein induces a protective mucosal immune response [4, 5] . Moreover, the FaeG deleted strains show a significant reduction in adherence to host epithelial cells [6] .",

Thus, interactions between F4ab, F4ac, or F4ad fimbriae and specific receptors on the host intestinal are essential in initiating attachment, colonization, and infection of the three serotypes. A polymorphism within mucin 4 intron 7 has been linked to an importance percentage of F4 ETEC adhesive phenotype and has been used in the primary selection of F4ab/ac-susceptible or -resistant piglets in various breeds [8, 9] . The inheritance pattern for the F4ad receptor is presumably controlled by a new mode; the partially adhesive receptor is dominated by only one gene and the fully adhesive receptor is encoded by more than one epistatic gene [10] . The receptor protein of the three variants also varies, i.e., the 210and 240-kDa intestinal mucin-type glycoprotein interact with both F4ab and F4ac, whereas a 74-kDa glycoprotein (GP74) and an intestinal neutral glycosphingolipid specifically adheres to F4ab and F4ad, respectively [11] .",

APN can activate or inactivate bioactive peptides on the cell surface, and cause cytokine and extracellular matrix degradation to show enzymatic activity. APN plays a role in inflammatory and immunological responses, antigen processing, tumor invasion, and cell-cell contact. Moreover, APN modulates signals in monocytes [13] and is a receptor for several coronaviruses, i.e., canine coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [14, 15] . Importantly, APN is also a direct receptor for ETEC F4 fimbriae and is associated with the induction of mucosal immunity [16] . FaeG from all three variants directly mediate the fimbrial binding of F4 + E. coli to host intestinal epithelial cells by binding to APN, while also modulating APN expression in IPEC-J2 cells that in turn influences ETEC adherence [6, 17] .",

The presence of an N-glycosylation sequon between AAs 286-288 in porcine APN, that is absent in human APN, blocked the entry of human coronaviruses 229E. APN glycosylation determines the species specificity of group 1 coronavirus infection [32] . In addition, APN is a recently reported receptor protein for F4 fimbriae. APNs are involved in oral immune responses and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of F4 fimbriae [16] . Previous studies have found that F4 ETEC susceptibility is not associated with the genetic polymorphisms or expression differences in the APN gene, and that the \u03b12-3,6,8 sialic acid of APN is sufficient for the binding of F4 fimbriae [16, 33] . In our previous study, we found that changes in APN expression in IPEC-J2 cells could affect F4 ETEC adherence, and the results of yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays confirmed that APN directly binds to the major fimbrial subunit FaeG in all three variants; however, we did not think that meta-periodate (NaIO 4 ) treatment had a significant impact on APN-FaeG binding in vitro [17] . We also found that the brush border membrane vesicles of F4 susceptible piglets have weaker F4 binding after 10 mM NaIO4 treatment for 30 min; this phenomenon is in accordance with earlier reports that the binding of F4ac to porcine enterocytes depends on glycosylation [16, 34] . However, details on the key glycosylation site in APN protein and whether APN glycosylation in vitro differs from that of in vivo remain unclear. Ultimately, the binding determinant in the interplay between APN and FaeG still needs to be elucidated.",

To test this hypothesis, we used membranes spotted with APN peptides libraries incubated in both fusion FaeG proteins and natural F4 fimbrial proteins. Our data suggests that the primary sequence of APN recognized by FaeG is limited to 13 specific peptides, and that these 13 peptides are located throughout the APN protein and exhibit different binding strengths in F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad.

However, the linear mapping might be not in accordance with the protein structure, considering fusion proteins and peptides not well glycosylated, the critical residues mentioned above might be quite different from three-dimensional (3D) images of the FaeG-APN interactions, we further adopted Modeller version 9.17 as the homology modeling tool to develop 3D structures of APN-FaeG complexes [35] . The potential interacted residues in APN-FaeG interplay were performed with the help of GRAMM-X Protein-Protein Docking Web Server v.1.2.0 [36] based on template structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: APN-4FKE [37] , F4ab FaeG-4WE2, F4ac FaeG-2J6R, F4ad FaeG-4WEU) (Additional file 4). Based on the stronger reactivity with APN in both ELISA and the confocal microscopy, peptides F4ab 148-160, F4ac 200-218 and F4ad 200-218 were selected for further analysis. After we confirmed the potential interacted residues of these three peptides for the APN-FaeG binding at 4\u00c5 resolution, we constructed a panel of peptides and FaeG proteins with single point mutations and used them to test for direct interplay with APN both in vitro and in vivo. We observed a major change in FaeG reactivity with mutations in the amino acids N209, L212 of F4ac FaeG, while G159 of F4ab FaeG and A200 of F4ad FaeG also effect on the APN-FaeG binding.",

Each peptide was 13 amino acids in length and offset from its neighboring peptide by 3 amino acids.Additional file 3. ELISA assays. We coated APN protein and 13 peptides of the APN on ELISA plates, and then used the coated plates to test the binding activity of the APN with the F4 fimbriae and the FaeG peptides. We used the APN protein as a positive control. The data presented here are a supplementation for Figure 5B and shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviations. ",
