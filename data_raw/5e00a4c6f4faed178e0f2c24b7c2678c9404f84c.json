In this study, we isolated a Yokose virus from a serum sample of Myotis daubentonii (order Chiroptera, family Vespertilionidae) collected in Yunnan province, China in 2013. Methods: The serum specimens of bat were used to inoculate in BHK-21 and Vero E6 cells for virus isolation. Then the viral complete genome sequence was obtained and was used for phylogenetic analysis performed by BEAST software package. Results: The virus was shown to have cytopathic effects in mammalian cells (BHK-21 and Vero E6). Genome sequencing indicated that it has a single open reading frame (ORF), with a genome of 10,785 nucleotides in total. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome suggests that XYBX1332 is a Yokose virus (YOKV) of the genus Flavivirus. Nucleotide and amino acid homology levels of the ORF of XYBX1332 and Oita-36, the original strain of YOKV, were 72 and 82%, respectively. The ORFs of XYBX1332 and Oita-36 encode 3422 and 3425 amino acids, respectively. In addition, the non-coding regions (5\u2032-and 3\u2032untranslated regions [UTRs]) of these two strains differ in length and the homology of the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTRs was 81.5 and 78. 3%, respectively.",

Sequencing results indicate that the YOKV genome is 10,857 nucleotides (nt) in total [8] . Like other flaviviruses, YOKV has only one open reading frame (ORF), which encodes 3425 amino acids. The genome encodes three structural proteins, the capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). There are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions at the ends of the genome. Molecular genetic analysis indicated that YOKV is a new member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [8] . Furthermore, YOKV is genetically related to other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus. YOKV is closely related to yellow fever virus, which both clustered in the same clade [8] . Additionally, YOKV was neutralized by antisera to individuals inoculated with yellow fever virus vaccine. The above results suggested that this new member of flavivirus is genetically related to yellow fever virus. A serological survey of YOKV in the Philippines and Malaysia showed that the YOKV antibody was detected in the serum of bats (Rousettus leschenaultii), suggesting that the distribution of YOKV was not limited to Yokosuka Island, Japan [9] (Fig. 1) .",

The homology of the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTR sequences between the two strains was determined to be 81.5 and 78.3%, respectively (Table 5 ).5) It is only 74% of the nucleotide homology in the 3'end of NS5 gene between XYBX1332 virus and Oita-36 virus (Table 4) , which is much lower than cut-off (84%) of that between species of Flavivirus [17] . These results suggested that, although XYBX1332 is a YOKV based on phylogenetic analysis, it may be a new virus in Flavivirus. Furthermore, the cross-neutralization test between XYBX1332 virus and Oita-36 virus would be conducted by the antigenicity between the viruses to confirm whether the XYBX1332 virus is a new species in Flavivirus. As mentioned earlier, YOKV (Oita-36) was first isolated from a bat (M. fuliginosus) in Japan, while XYBX1332 was isolated from the serum of M. daubentonii. Although the strains were isolated from different bat species, Miniopterus fuliginosus (Miniopterus, Miniopteridae) and Myotis daubentonii (Myotis, Vespertilioninae), both species belong to the suborder Microchiroptera of the order Chiroptera [18] . The isolation of YOKVs from microbats on two separate occasions suggests that microbats may be suitable hosts for YOKV, although the YOKV replicates poorly in the fruit bat [9] .",

            "text": "Bats are mammals that can fly and are characterized by a large number of species and wide distribution. Many studies have shown that bats can carry and spread a variety of pathogens that can cause human and animal disease [19] , including SARS [20] , Ebola virus [21] , and influenza virus [22] . After years of monitoring, a large number of recombinant coronaviruses were discovered in bats, further suggesting that bats may be the host animal for SARS [23] . Given that Oita-36 and XYBX1332 were isolated from the serum of bats, it has been suggested that YOKV can exist in bats, may be occasionally in the long term. How is the virus transmitted to bats? In recent years, Kaeng Khoi virus [10] , Orthoreovirus [24] , Bunyavirus [25] , and Rhabdovirus [26] have been isolated from bat flies (Eucampsipoda sundaica), an ectozoon that resides on bats. Whether a cycle including bat flies or other blood-sucking insects (vectors) and bats (hosts) present in the wild to maintain and spread YOKV will require further studies. ",
