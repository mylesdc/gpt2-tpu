The region containing the N-terminal \u03b1-helix and heme was domain-swapped between protomers in the dimer formed in E. coli. The amount of cyt c 552 oligomers increased in E. coli as the cyt c 552 concentration was increased, whereas that of high-order oligomers decreased in the order of decrease in protein stability, indicating that domain swapping decreases in cells when the protein stability decreases. Apo cyt c 552 was detected in the cyt c 552 oligomer formed in E. coli, but not in that of the A5F/M11V/Y32F/Y41E/I76V mutant. The cyt c 552 oligomer containing its apo protein may form at the periplasm, since the apo protein detected by mass measurements did not contain the signal peptide. These results show that domain-swapped cyt c 552 oligomers were formed in E. coli, owing to the stability of the transient oligomer containing the apo protein before heme attachment. This is an indication that exceedingly stable proteins may have disadvantages forming domain-swapped oligomers in cells.",

Domain swapping was first reported by Eisenberg and co-workers for diphtheria toxin in 1994 1 . Since then, domain swapping has been reported for many proteins [2] [3] [4] . For example, ribonuclease (RNase) A swaps its N-terminal \u03b1 -helix or C-terminal \u03b2 -strand, forming two different domain-swapped structures 5, 6 . The domain swapping of RNase A occurs during folding from its partially unfolded state 7 .",

We have shown that horse cytochrome (cyt) c domain swaps its C-terminal \u03b1 -helix by treatment with ethanol 11 , or when refolding from its guanidinium ion-induced unfolded state 19 . The hydrophobic interaction between the N-and C-terminal \u03b1 -helices at the early stage of folding is important for domain swapping in cyt c 19 . According to small angle X-ray scattering measurements, a certain amount of cyt c molecules interacted as oligomers in its molten globule state, whereas the domain-swapped dimer of cyt c was obtained by refolding from its molten globule state 20 . Hydrogenobacter thermophilus (HT) cyt c 552 is a thermostable c-type cytochrome. Its high thermostability is achieved by the dense packing of the side chains of hydrophobic amino acids [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . HT cyt c 552 has been shown to form dimers by domain swapping, but the swapping region (N-terminal \u03b1 -helix and heme) was different from that of horse cyt c 12 . The domain-swapped dimer of HT cyt c 552 also exhibited high thermostability by maintaining the high density of the amino acid side chains as in the monomer, where the dimer did not dissociate to monomers at 70 \u00b0C 12 . For biosynthesis of HT cyt c 552 and many gram-negative bacterial c-type cytochromes, the apo precursor protein is synthesized at the cytoplasm and transferred to the periplasm by a secretory protein 26, 27 . After the signal peptide is cleaved at the periplasm, a heme is attached to the apo protein by a cyt c maturation (Ccm) system 28 . It is presumed that the Ccm system is a chaperone for the apo protein and avoids aggregation of the apo protein during the cyt c maturation process in vivo 29 .",

            "text": "Oligomerization of HT cyt c 552 in E. coli cells. To investigate formation of oligomers in E. coli, we freezethawed E. coli cells expressing wild-type (WT) HT cyt c 552 , and performed size exclusion chromatography for the extracted solution. Peaks were observed at elution volumes of 50-75 and 85 ml in the chromatogram (Fig. 1A) . The peak at 85 ml corresponded to that of monomeric HT cyt c 552 . The ratio of the absorption at 410 nm to that at 280 nm (Abs 410 /Abs 280 ) for the fractions at 50-75 ml was about 3.6 ( Fig. 1A) . Heme staining was performed for the sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-PAGE gel of the fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography to investigate the presence of heme c (Fig. 1B) . A main band with a mass corresponding to the molecular weight of HT cyt c 552 (9.2 kDa) was detected in all of the fractions at 50-75 ml. This value corresponded well to that of HT cyt c 552 . Therefore, we attributed the peak at 50-75 ml to HT cyt c 552 oligomers. However, no oligomers were detected in the chromatogram when HT cyt c 552 and cyt c 552 free E. coli lysate were freeze-thawed together (Supplementary information, Fig. S1 ), indicating that HT cyt c 552 oligomers were formed in E. coli by non-covalent association of its monomers. Structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 obtained from E. coli. To elucidate the detailed structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 obtained from the E. coli expression system, we purified dimeric HT cyt c 552 and solved its X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB code: 4ZID) (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). There was one HT cyt c 552 protomer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, and a domain-swapped structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 was obtained at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 2) . The hinge loop was composed of Ala18, Lys19, and Lys20. The N-terminal \u03b1 -helix from Asn1 to Lys17, together with the heme, was swapped between protomers in the dimer. The dimeric structure was similar to that obtained previously by treatment with ethanol (PDB code: 3VYM) 12 . The root-mean-square deviation value of C\u03b1 carbons between the protomer structure of the dimer obtained from the E. coli expression system and that obtained previously by treatment with ethanol (PDB code: 3VYM) was 0.43 \u00c5, indicating that the protomer structures were similar.",

The lifetime of Bradyrhizobium japonicum apo c-type protein without a signal peptide is estimated to be 2-5 min in the periplasm of E. coli 40 .

In addition, the apo protein was not detected in the mass spectra of the fractions of the oligomers in the Ni affinity chromatogram of the quintuple mutant ( Fig. 3F-H) . For refolding in vitro, the WT holo protein formed oligomers with its apo protein, whereas the quintuple mutant did not (Supplementary information, Fig. S4 ). The \u03b1 -helical content of the apo protein of the WT protein and quintuple mutant was estimated at 19% and 11%, respectively, according to the circular dichroism (CD) spectra, whereas that of the holo protein was estimated at 49% and 42%, respectively (Supplementary information, Fig. S5 ). These results showed that the holo and apo proteins of the quintuple mutant were unfolded more compared to the corresponding forms of the WT protein. The stability of the mutant oligomer containing the apo form may decrease compared to that of the WT protein oligomer due to decrease in protein stability, causing decrease in formation of the domain-swapped oligomers in E. coli.",

            "text": "Based on the present results, we propose an oligomerization process for HT cyt c 552 in cells (Fig. 6) . When a holo protein is formed, it creates a transient oligomer with an apo protein. A heme is inserted to the apo protein of the transient holo-apo complex, refolding to a domain-swapped dimer. Higher order oligomers may form when an apo protein interacts with two holo proteins. For less stable proteins, the holo-apo complex dissociates to holo and apo monomers, eventually forming only holo monomers. Although apo cyt c has been shown to decompose by DegP protease at the periplasm of E. coli 41 , the apo protein of thermostable HT cyt c 552 survives from decomposition in the cells by forming a transient complex with its holo proteins. Our results reveal that more domain-swapped oligomers are formed for more stable proteins, and exceedingly stable proteins may have disadvantages by forming oligomer by-products in cells. Methods Construction of HT cyt c 552 expression system. The pKO2 plasmid DNA coding WT HT cyt c 552 , its modified plasmid DNA coding I76V, A5F/M11V, Y32F/Y41E, or A5F/M11V/Y32F/Y41E/I76V HT cyt c 552 , and pEC86 plasmid DNA coding the Ccm system with CcmA-CcmH were provided by Prof. Yoshihiro Sambongi (Hiroshima Univeristy) 36 .
