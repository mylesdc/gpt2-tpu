With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. Methodology/Principal Findings. We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R 0 = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30-40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). Conclusions/Significance. These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza. The methods that we employ for estimation of the reproductive numbers and the serial interval can be easily replicated in other populations and with other diseases.",

            "text": "The emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has raised concerns of an imminent influenza pandemic. Public health workers, government officials and disaster planners have an increasing interest in better understanding the potential impact of an influenza pandemic and possible strategies for containment. Crucial in this planning is an understanding of the basic epidemiology of the disease in various settings. This has led to a growing interest in the analysis and understanding of past epidemics, particularly that of 1918, the most virulent and deadly influenza epidemic of the 20th century. Mortality has been estimated at 50-100 million people worldwide as a result of influenza in the 1918 pandemic [1] . It is reasonable to suppose that by better understanding the transmission dynamics of the highly pathogenic virus in 1918, we can gain greater insight into the dynamics, and thus potential methods of control, for a future pandemic [2] . Important parameters for understanding disease transmission are the reproductive number and the serial interval [3] . The basic reproductive number is defined as the average number of secondary infections created from a primary infection in an entirely susceptible population [4, see also 5] . A more complex, but perhaps meaningful parameter is the effective reproductive number which defines the average number of secondary infections an infected will create at a given point in the epidemic. This parameter takes into account that not all contacts of an infected individual are with susceptible persons, as well as the impact of public health control measures. Control strategies are typically targeted to drive this number below one and maintain it there, as this will lead to eventual extinction of the epidemic. An example of this is herd immunity, or immunity to a disease that is incurred from a sufficiently large proportion of the population being immune to a disease. Modeling techniques are often used to determine the proportion of the population that should be vaccinated in order to have the reproductive number low enough to avoid outbreaks of disease [6] .",

[10] provides a thoughtful summary of methods for estimating the reproductive number. One particularly interesting and useful method has been previously described by [7] for estimating the daily reproductive number, R t , or the average number of cases an infected individual on day t would cause. One interesting feature of this method is that for days where no cases are observed, the estimated effective reproductive number is zero. Another observation is that this method essentially estimates a curve for the effective reproductive number that traces the epidemic curve, lagged by the average serial interval length. This nonparametric method presupposes information on the serial interval distribution. This is typical as most methods for estimating the reproductive number rely on knowledge of the serial interval.",

Using an exponential model and assuming the serial interval to be four days (somewhat based on the assumptions of [13] ), [15] estimated R 0 to be 2.6-10.6 for confined settings (such as prison and ships) and 2.4-4.3 for community settings.

One example of a reasonable model for this is the four parameter logistic curve [22] [23] [24] given by The parameters of this curve describe the initial height of the curve (approximately a+b), the point of inflection (d), the curvature over the inflection (c) and the final height of the curve (a). These parameters have biological meaning in this setting where the initial height corresponds to the values of R i prior to intervention and significant depletion of the susceptible population. The inflection point and its steepness would describe the timing of intervention and the rapidity with which it impacts transmission. The final height would describe the ultimate value of R i, which typically is less than one, indicating that disease transmission is in a sub epidemic state.",

For the Maryland communities, we report the average of the residuals obtained using the estimates from one community to predict the epidemics in each of the other four communities, creating five CV estimates (one for each community). Table 2 gives the results for the serial interval distribution estimates. Notable in these results is the striking consistency in the estimates of the first moment, with the exception of Cumberland. The second moments vary much more, however. In general they tend to be much larger for the ships when using the Garske et al. method compared to the MLE method. For the communities, we observe that they are consistently around 10 for the Garske et al. method and vary much more for the MLE method. Also of interest in these results are the large error estimates, particularly for Cumberland, but also to a smaller extent for Frederick.

The logistic model fits this as accurately as possible, but perhaps the important message is the qualitative result, indicating that initial transmission in this susceptible, non-quarantined population was very high and rapidly decreased as many became infected.

This method essentially traces the epidemic curve, lagged by the mean of the generation time distribution. Thus, according to the residuals, it appears that the WT method outperforms the MLE. However, considering the importance of external validation and reproducibility, the model suffers somewhat as evidenced by the CV measures.

Both methods assume that the population is closed, there are no missing cases and no migration to or from the population. The second of these assumptions is clearly violated with the data from Maryland; however the results appear to be reasonably robust to this discrepancy, except in the case of Cumberland. The purpose of this exercise determines to some extent which methodological approach we might favor. If the intent is to simply estimate the parameters for a specific epidemic and better understand what exactly was occurring in that setting, then the method presented by [12] (Garske et al.) appears to provide good fit. The caveat that we see in this method is that by estimating the effective reproductive number with the methodology of [7] (WT) there is an over fit of this parameter and it essentially traces the epidemic curve, lagged by the mean of the serial interval. It is not clear if this is a desirable or informative property. The MLE method has greater promise for generalizeability. While it can be argued that adhering to a parametric definition of the shape of the effective reproductive number leads to a greater chance of lack of fit, it can also lead to a result that can be interpretable for other settings that are similar to that being studied.",

Further, we consistently see a large initial value for the reproductive number. In the ships, this value is higher and rapidly drops off, perhaps due to the close quarters and extremely rapid transmission that could take place in these very vulnerable populations. In the communities, the reproductive number tended to drop off later, typically around day thirty.
