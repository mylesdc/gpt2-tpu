            "text": "CCR2 is a chemokine receptor expressed on the surface of blood leukocytes, particularly \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb inflammatory monocytes and microglia. Signaling through this receptor is thought to influence the immune activity of microglia as well as monocytes egress from the bone marrow (BM) and their trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) in several neurological diseases. During experimental herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE), CCR2 deficiency has been reported to exacerbate the outcome of the disease. However, the precise contribution of CCR2 expressed in cells of the CNS or peripheral monocytes in the protection against HSE remains unclear. To dissect the differential role of CCR2 during HSE, chimeric mice with receptor deficiency in the brain or blood cells were generated by transplanting wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or CCR2 -/-BMderived cells in CCR2 -/-(WT!CCR2 -/-) and WT (CCR2 -/-!WT) mice, respectively. Our results indicate that following intranasal infection with 1.2x10 6 plaque forming units of HSV-1, CCR2 deficiency in hematopoietic cells and, to a lesser extent, in CNS exacerbates the outcome of HSE. Mortality rates of CCR2 -/-(71.4%) and CCR2 -/-!WT (57.1%) mice were significantly higher than that of WT (15.3%; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) but the difference did not reach statistical significance for WT!CCR2 -/animals (42.8%; P = 0.16). Both peripheral and CNS deficiencies in CCR2 resulted in increased infectious viral titers and wider dissemination of HSV antigens in the brain as well as an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system altered monocytes egress from the BM and their recruitment to the CNS, which may contribute to the failure in HSV-1 containment. Collectively, these data suggest that CCR2 expressed on cells of CNS and especially on peripheral monocytes is important for the control of HSV-1 replication and inflammatory environment during experimental HSE.",

HSE affects 2 to 4 individuals per million people per year and can result from either primary or recurrent infection mainly caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) [3] [4] [5] . HSE is known to induce severe neuro-inflammation associated with impairment of neurological functions leading to clinical signs such as altered consciousness, abnormal behavior and localized neurological findings including seizure and paralysis [6, 7] . Prior to the introduction of the antiviral drug acyclovir, the mortality rate in HSE patients was over 70%, which has markedly decreased to 10-30% with specific treatment. However, between 25% and 90% of survivors have been reported to develop neurological sequelae [1, 8] . Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) remains incomplete. It has been suggested that both direct virally-induced and indirect inflammatory-mediated damages are implicated in HSE and death following acute infection [9] [10] [11] .",

It has been reported that microglia are implicated in the control of virus replication in the brain by producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as type I interferons (IFN-I), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL5 [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition to microglia, it has been demonstrated that following HSV infection, a high expression of chemokines induced the infiltration of blood monocytes into the CNS through rolling and adhesion mechanisms along the brain endothelium wall [16, 17] . In mice, blood monocytes can be classified into two subsets based on the expression levels of chemokine receptors C-X3-C motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2): the inflammatory monocytes (CCR2 + /CX3CR1 low /Ly6C hi ) that are actively recruited into inflamed tissues and contribute to inflammatory responses, and the patrolling monocytes (CCR2 \u2212 /CX3CR1 high /Ly6C low ) that exert a surveillance role in the lumen of blood vessels and promote tissue repair [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that both monocyte subsets are able to infiltrate the CNS during experimental HSE and may play an important role in elaborating the immune response to HSV-1 infection [26] .",

Information regarding the expression of CCR2 at the surface of non-hematopoietic cells in the CNS and its role in immune response are currently limited and vary depending on mouse models of cerebral insults [27] . It is reported that CCR2 is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and particularly microglia in various regions of human brain [27] . Furthermore, it has been shown that CCL2 activates microglia by triggering the release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as by up-regulating their CCR2 expression level in a mouse model of stroke [37] [38] [39] . In contrast, another study using CCR2-red fluorescent protein (RFP) knock-in mice did not confirm that CCR2 was expressed in the CNS. Indeed, no CCR2-RFP signal could be detected in neurons, microglia or astrocytes of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [40] .",

Such reduced levels of monocytes in the blood were associated with higher mortality rates in CCR2 -/mice compared to wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 controls [33] . However, this study did not permit to delineate the relative contribution of CCR2 signaling in blood monocytes and cells of the CNS. To circumvent this caveat and better evaluate the impact of CCR2 signaling on the outcome of HSE, we generated chimeric mice lacking this receptor either in cells of the CNS or of the hematopoietic system (i.e., circulating leukocytes). By using these chimeric mouse models, we evaluated the effect of CCR2 deficiency in each of these compartments on the outcome of HSE (survival rates), infectious titers and viral distribution, cytokines/chemokines levels in the brain, and monocytes trafficking. We report here that the CCR2 signaling pathway through blood leukocytes and, to a lesser extent, through cells of the CNS influences the control of HSE.",

Eight weeks post-transplantation, mice were infected intranasally with 1.2x10 6 PFU of HSV-1. Ageand sex-matched total body CCR2 -/and WT C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. It is well accepted that CCR2 could be expressed by blood leukocytes including monocytes but its expression by resident microglia of the CNS may vary depending on mouse models of diseases [18, 27] . We have thus evaluated the expression of this receptor in brain macrophages prior to and following infection with HSV-1 by immunohistochemistry analyses in all groups of mice. No immuno-reactivity for CCR2 could be detected prior to infection in all groups of mice (data not shown). Interestingly, CCR2-positive cells that also express the microglia marker Iba1 were detected in brain sections of the olfactory bulb (not shown) and the medulla of WT, CCR2 -/-!WT and WT!CCR2 -/mice on days 6 (S1 Fig) and 8 (not shown) post-infection (p.i.) whereas no signal was detected in CCR2 -/group. We cannot exclude that CCR2-positive cells detected in brains of WT and WT!CCR2 -/animals could be blood leucocytes, which are known to infiltrate the CNS following infection with HSV-1 in our mouse model of HSE [26] . However, in the CCR2 -/-!WT group, CCR2 expression is restricted to resident cells of the CNS since infiltrating cells are CCR2-negative.",

In our study, the expression levels of CD45 and CD11b were used to distinguish \u00abCD45 low /CD11b + \u00bb from \u00abCD45 hi /CD11b + \u00bb cells which were attributed to resident microglia and infiltrating leukocytes, respectively (Fig 6A) . Infiltrating monocytes were further differentiated according to Ly6C expression level into \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb inflammatory and \u00abLy6C low \u00bb patrolling monocytes, respectively. Fig 6B shows that in the WT group, 11.3%\u00b10.9 of all brain leukocytes (i.e., CD45 + ) expressed the \u00abCD45 hi \u00bb marker on day 0 and were attributed to infiltrating immune cells.

Overall, our results indicate that the lack of CCR2 signaling pathway throughout the body and more specifically in the hematopoietic compartment alters the infiltration of blood leukocytes into the CNS during HSE. Fig 6C shows that levels of \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb inflammatory monocytes in WT mice were slightly increased on day 4 (from 1.3%\u00b10.1 on day 0 to 1.7%\u00b10.4) and were significantly higher on days 6 (11.5%\u00b12.2; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and 8 (6.8%\u00b10.9; P<0.01 (not indicated)) following infection. Their amount then decreased on day 10 p.i. to reach baseline level (1.7%\u00b10.2). The infiltration kinetic of \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb monocytes in WT!CCR2 -/mice was similar to that of WT but levels were slightly higher than WT on day 6 without reaching statistical significance. Levels of \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb monocytes also increased on day 6 p.i. in CCR2 -/-(from 1.0%\u00b10.1 prior to infection to 5.9%\u00b11.7; P<0.001 (not indicated)) and CCR2 -/-!WT (from 1.3%\u00b10.5 to 3.8% \u00b11.0; P<0.05 (not indicated)). Their amounts then decreased on days 8 and 10 following infection to reach baseline levels. Importantly, the amounts of inflammatory monocytes were significantly lower in CCR2 -/-(P<0.01) and CCR2 -/-!WT (P<0.001) animals on day 6 and in CCR2 -/-!WT (P<0.01) on day 8 p.i. than those of WT group. Globally, these data suggest that a complete CCR2 deficiency, and particularly that in the hematopoietic compartment, results in a lack of inflammatory monocytes infiltration, which could alter the immune response to HSV-1 infection. Fig 6D shows that in WT mice, \u00abLy6C low \u00bb patrolling monocytes invaded the CNS on day 6 p.i. (from 2.3%\u00b10.2 on day 0 to 3.5%\u00b10.3; P<0.05 (not indicated)) and reached a peak level on day 8 (5.1%\u00b10.7; P<0.001 (not indicated)) to finally decrease on day 10 (1.7%\u00b10.5) p.i. This infiltration pattern is in line with previous studies from our laboratory showing the delayed infiltration of this monocyte subset during HSE [26] . Earlier (day 6) and higher levels of patrolling monocytes were observed in the CNS of CCR2 -/-(4.7%\u00b10.4; P<0.05) and CCR2 -/-!WT (5.2%\u00b10.5; P<0.01) mice compared to WT. On day 8 following infection, levels decreased significantly in these groups (P<0.01 for CCR2 -/and P<0.001 for CCR2 -/-!WT) compared to WT mice to reach baseline amounts on day 10. Levels of patrolling monocytes in WT!CCR2 -/mice were slightly higher than those of WT on day 8 p.i. but the difference did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that patrolling monocytes trafficking appears to be influenced by CCR2 deficiency localized in the hematopoietic system.",

Indeed, our results showed that infectious viral titers were increased in the brain of CCR2-deficient mice compared to resistant WT animals regardless of the compartment lacking this receptor (CNS vs hematopoietic system). These data suggest that CCR2 signaling in resident cells of the CNS may be involved in viral containment mechanisms since reconstitution of CCR2 -/recipient mice with WT hematopoietic cells was not sufficient to control the infection. In this context, the role played by CCR2 signaling in the modulation of the cerebral immune response is not completely elucidated. It has been demonstrated that microglia express CCR2 upon stimuli or lesions and that this receptor plays a role in the immunological response of these cells as well as in their recruitment to injured brain areas [49] [50] [51] . Furthermore, CCR2 deficiency also resulted in altered microglial activation following LPS challenge [38] .",

Thus, we suggest that the inefficient viral containment in CCR2 -/and CCR2 -/-!WT mice may be related to the altered recruitment of inflammatory monocytes in the brain. Indeed, it is believed that the CCR2/CCL2 axis is a potent pathway for \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb inflammatory monocytes recruitment into the CNS in models of stroke [52] , Alzheimer's disease [47, 48] and EAE [22, 40] . In the context of viral encephalitis, alteration or blockade of the CCR2/CCL2 axis can significantly reduce the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the infected brain [15, 21, 33, 53] . In addition, \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb inflammatory monocytes appear to play an important role in viral containment. Indeed, higher mortality rates and increased brain viral loads were reported in HSV-2 [54] , coronavirus [55] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [46] infections when these cells are depleted. Our hypothesis is corroborated by a study using a mouse model of WNV infection which demonstrated that CCR2 deficiency results in higher brain viral load which was associated with a reduction of \u00abLy6C hi \u00bb monocytes infiltration in the CNS, supporting a protective role for these cells [44] .",

It was demonstrated that CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are severely monocytopenic and this is dependent on both CCL2 and CCL7 [58] . Similar to our results, monocytopenia was observed in blood of CCR2 -/mice infected with WNV [44] . However, this study suggested that CCR2 deficiency alters inflammatory monocytes accumulation in the blood but did not affect their recruitment into the CNS. As expected, our results showed that CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system resulted in an important blood monocytopenia. Indeed, levels of inflammatory monocytes were decreased prior to and following infection in the blood of CCR2 -/and CCR2 -/-!WT mice. Thus, the lack of inflammatory monocytes recruitment observed in the CNS of mice having a peripheral deficiency may either be due to the monocytopenia or the absence of CCR2-dependent monocytes trafficking from the blood to the brain. On the other hand, levels of patrolling monocytes, for which recruitment was not shown to be related to CCR2 signaling, only decreased on day 6 p.i. in the blood of mice with peripheral deficiency compared to WT group but these cells were able to infiltrate the CNS despite their low levels in the blood. However, patrolling monocytes were recruited earlier in these mice indicating that CCR2 deficiency may influence their kinetics of infiltration.",

            "text": "It is known that HSV-1 infection of the CNS induces cytokines and chemokines production that play an important role in the control of HSE. Indeed, the control of HSV-1 infection requires the expression of a series of cytokines, mainly IFN-I, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [14, 59] . Other studies have also shown the involvement of chemokines since the expression levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased in the brain of mice infected with HSV-1 [16, 17] . However, an excessive production of these immune mediators could be associated with an exacerbation of the disease and increased lethality [9, 11] . In this respect, the increased mortality rates observed in CCR2-deficient mice and when deficiency affects hematopoietic cells, were associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5) production in the brain compared to WT. Indeed, it has been already reported that chemokine receptors deficiency may result in increased inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production during CNS insults, which could increase brain damages as well as lethality [16, 17, 44, 60] . Furthermore, the excessive production of chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5, observed in the more susceptible groups could induce the recruitment of peripheral immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and T cells that in turn may contribute to amplify the global inflammation triggered by the virally-infected cells [11] . It will be of interest to further investigate the dynamics of these leukocytes and to address the impact of CCR2 deficiency on their recruitment to the CNS during HSE.",

Supporting Information S1 Fig. Microglia express CCR2 in the CNS following HSV-1 infection. WT, CCR2 -/-!WT, WT!CCR2 -/and CCR2 -/mice were infected with HSV-1 via the intranasal route and sacrificed prior to and on days 4, 6, 8 and 10 following infection. The expression of CCR2 by brain macrophages was assessed in brain sections by double immunostaining with goat anti-CCR2 and rabbit anti-Iba1 followed by secondary antibodies, Alexa 488-conjugated chicken antigoat (green) and Alexa 594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit (red), respectively. Nuclear staining with DAPI is shown in blue. Pictures depicted here are representative of the region of the medulla of mice sacrificed on day 6 following the infection.

Eightweek old recipient wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and CCR2 -/mice conditioned with irradiation were transplanted with bone marrow cells harvested from CCR2 -/-(CCR2 -/-!WT) and WT (WT!CCR2 -/-) animals, respectively. Total body CCR2 -/and WT mice were used as controls. Sixteen-week old WT, CCR2 -/-, CCR2 -/-!WT and WT!CCR2 -/mice (n = 14 mice per group) were infected intranasally with HSV-1 (1.2x10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) in 20 \u03bcl minimal essential medium). Mice were examined carefully twice a day for 20 days, and two obvious signs of sickness or a ! 20 % weight loss were considered as endpoints for sacrifice. Survival curves were analysed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
