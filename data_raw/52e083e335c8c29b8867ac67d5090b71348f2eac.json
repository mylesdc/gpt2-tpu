            "text": "Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious life threatening and nosocomial infections including pneumonia. PA has the ability to alter host genome to facilitate its invasion, thus increasing the virulence of the organism. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, is known to play a key role in facilitating infection. Sphingosine kinases (SPHK) 1&2 phosphorylate sphingosine to generate S1P in mammalian cells. We reported earlier that Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice offered significant protection against lung inflammation, compared to wild type (WT) animals. Therefore, we profiled the differential expression of genes between the protected group of Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 and the wild type controls to better understand the underlying protective mechanisms related to the Sphk2 deletion in lung inflammatory injury. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on mouse lung tissue using NextSeq 500 sequencing system. Results: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes following PA infection were identified using whole transcriptome of Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice and their WT counterparts. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses of the RNA seq data identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a crucial role in pneumonia caused by PA such as those involved in: 1. Immune response to PA infection and NF-\u03baB signal transduction; 2. PKC signal transduction; 3. Impact on epigenetic regulation; 4. Epithelial sodium channel pathway; 5. Mucin expression; and 6. Bacterial infection related pathways. Our genomic data suggests a potential role for SPHK2 in PA-induced pneumonia through elevated expression of inflammatory genes in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 10 differentially expressed genes showed 100% concordance in terms of vectoral changes as well as significant fold change.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an aggressive Gramnegative bacillus that causes serious opportunistic infections such as pneumonia in humans, leading to significant morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . However, it is interesting to note that PA is also capable of causing serious infections in plants and insects with significant correlation to virulence across the species [4, 5] . Among patients, those with cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and on mechanical ventilation are particularly prone to develop pneumonia caused by PA infection [6] . In fact, PA plays a major role in deterioration of lung function in CF patients. A highly virulent organism that can even grow in water, PA has of late been recognized to be capable of altering the host genome it infects in order to facilitate its own virulence [7] [8] [9] [10] . It is known that PA -mediated pneumonia leads to a cascade of responses in the host, starting with innate immune response followed by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and differential regulation of sphingolipid metabolic pathways [11] [12] [13] . In the sphingolipid pathway, it has been noted that sphingosine, which is normally present in respiratory tract of healthier patients, is almost absent in CF patients [14] . On the contrary, ceramides generated by acid sphingomyelinase are known to accumulate in the airway epithelium of CF patients with pneumonia [13, 15] . Among sphingolipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), synthesized from sphingosine by sphingosine kinases (SPHK)1 and 2, is an intercellular and intracellular bioactive lipid mediator that regulates pleotropic cellular functions under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Genetic deletion of Sphk1, but not Sphk2, in mouse caused aggravation of LPS-induced lung injury, suggesting a protective role for SPHK1/S1P signaling against endotoxemia [16] . In contrast, adenoviral overexpression of SPHK2 in wild type (WT) mouse augmented LPS-induced lung injury [16] [17] [18] , while deletion of Sphk2, but not Sphk1, ameliorated PA-induced lung inflammation and injury in mice [11] . Using Sphk2 knockout (KO) mice, we decided to unravel the key pathways selectively associated with SPHK2 signaling that play a role in PA-induced pathogenesis using differential gene expression analysis.",

In this study, we identified a set of PA responsive genes activated in the WT mice in comparison with Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 . Our results show that SPHK2/S1P signaling cascade mediating PA-induced pneumonia modulates signaling events related to extracellular matrix remodeling, interleukin (IL) signaling, and complement cascade in the host lung. In addition, we also noted that genetic deletion of Sphk2 resisted alteration of host pulmonary genome by PA infection by promoting its own virulence.

ANOVA model was based on Method of Moments [23] in combination with Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) contrast (Tamhane and Dunlop, 2000). The Fisher's contrast allowed calculation of direction and magnitude of change for all pair-wise comparisons between the treatment groups and was later validated by RT-PCR. Raw reads were aligned to reference genome using Burroughs-Wheeler Aligner Maximal Exact Matches (BWA-MEM) [24] . Gene expression was quantified using FeatureCounts [25] . Differential expression statistics (fold-change and pvalue) were computed using edgeR [26, 27] , generalized linear models to model the effect of genotype, infection, and their interaction. We used Globus Genomics [28] for these analyses. Calculated raw p-values were adjusted for False Discovery Rate (FDR) according to Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction procedure [29, 30] . Significant genes were determined based on an FDR threshold of 5% (0.05) and plotted in a heatmap. The FDR incorporates sample size in each group, sequencing depth and gene expression variability. The significance calculated is an output dependent on these factors. In spite of reducing the number in one group to two and comparing with the three in other groups, the data show significant changes in number of genes as shown in the results with FDR set at 0.05. The data and the level of significance presented are independent of human error. Pathway enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes was performed using the Pathway Maps database in MetaCore. The top 35 genes, based on the interaction term FDR, were plotted in a heatmap. Additionally, we compared the significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05) genes based on genotype, infection, or their interaction in a Venn diagram.",

In order to reduce duplication, we clustered nodal PWs based on their gene content in order to reduce duplication. Complete linkage hierarchical clustering on the Jaccard distance between the complete set of genes in each PW was used to identify closely related individual entities. A measure of the dissimilarity between two PWs (based on their gene sets) with scales from 0 to 1 was used; '0' if the sets are exactly the same, and '1' if they are completely different and have no genes in common. For the purpose of biological interpretations, we considered each cluster of closely related PWs as one unit or mega pathway (dissimilarity cut off of 0.6). We combined all associated differential genes for analyzing gene interactions and creating heatmaps as shown in the Venn diagram (Fig. 1 ) and a dendrogram (Fig. 2) .

A list of the identified fifty PWs in the order of their position on hierarchical clustering graph and details of the clustering of similar pathways are provided in Additional file 3: Table S2 . As described in the methods, a dissimilarity score of 0.6 was used as cut off for the selection of clustering pathways and reducing the redundancy. The data were condensed to eight cluster PWs that are differentially regulated among the four groups (WT CTRL, WT PA, Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 CTRL and Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 PA) studied, and heatmaps show differential expression of selected genes (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 ). The first heatmap provides a depiction of the top 35 differentially expressed genes between the groups (Fig. 3) . The Differentially regulated genes in the PW clusters WT mice challenged with PA showed significant upregulation of the genes related to NF-\u03baB pathway in contrast to similarly treated Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4) . Of the five genes encoding for the Nf\u03bab family, there was significant increase in expression of NF-\u03baB1, NF-\u03baB2, Rel A and Rel B. Genes encoding for NF-\u03baB inhibitors alpha and beta were also significantly elevated in the WT PA group compared to the rest of the groups. Interestingly, the Dtl gene, which encodes for TNF superfamily member 13b (TNFRSF13B), was down-regulated in the WT PA compared to the rest of the groups. This cytokine expressed in B cell lineage acts as a potent B cell activator stimulating their proliferation and differentiation [32] .",

In this context, we noted that genes in the PKC pathway have undergone significant differential regulation following infection with PA of both WT and Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 groups. PKC family of proteins activate target proteins by promoting phosphorylation at serine and threonine amino acid residues [33] . In the WT PA group upregulation of virulence promoting members of the Fig. 7 Genes that are differentially regulated in the nodal pathway related to cluster 11a. This cluster details the Epithelial sodium channel regulation in normal and cystic fibrosis airways. Among the genes downregulated in WT PA in contrast to Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 PA are those coding for Adcy8-the adenylate cyclase 8 gene, Scnn1g-the gamma subunit of sodium channel, Plcb3, Nedd4. Furin and Edn1 were up-regulated in WT PA compared to Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 PA. Edn1 belongs to endothelin family PKC family such as Sele (stimulating adhesion of leucocytes) [34] , and Lcp2 and Nr4a1 that promote apoptosis [35] was observed. Further, a significant down-regulation of genes essential for maintenance of normal metabolic state in the WT PA group belonging to the PKC family was observed. The down-regulated genes included Prkcz, Prkaca, Prkg2, Ppp1r14a and Plcb3. These genes were maintained in an up-regulated state in the control as well as the Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 group challenged with PA. Prkcz is a member of the PKC family, which, unlike the classical PKC isoenzymes, shows calcium and diacylglycerol (DAG) independent activation. Prkaca, protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA C\u03b1) is a member of the AGC kinase family, contributing to the control of cellular processes such as glucose metabolism and cell division [36] . Prkg2 encodes Protein Kinase, CGMP-Dependent, Type II, is a crucial regulator of intestinal secretion and bone growth [37, 38] . This protein also phosphorylates and activates CFTR on the plasma membrane. Ppp1r14a, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14A, is an inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase. Plcb3 encodes phospholipase C beta 3 that catalyzes the production of the second messengers such as DAG and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate from phosphatidylinositol via G-protein-linked receptor-mediated signal transduction.",

This is essential for clearance of the pathogen and limit further damage. PA is responsible for a variety of infections in the nosocomial setting. It also causes serious pulmonary infections of CF patients, and has been reported to alter genome expression in the host cell beyond inciting a strong innate immune response [49, 50] . Here, we report the genomic host response in WT mice infected with PA and the essential role of SPHK2 in the ensuing pathogenesis that is relevant to pneumonia and sepsis. Our gene expression analysis clearly revealed a link between SPHK2 and several key downstream pathways that play a role, either directly or indirectly in PA pathogenesis. One of the earliest attempts to study transcriptional changes following PA infection was carried out in A549 cells [49] , wherein interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) was noted to be activated. In the same study, genes encoding transcription factors such as IkB-(NF-kB Inhibitor Validation was done using the most differentially expressed genes from the gene pool identified by the microarray. The genes studied were Spata13, Hdc, G0 s2, Fosl2, Dgat1, Kdm6b, Odc1, Smtnl2, Clec1a, and Sox17 Fig. 12 Validation by Western Blot of differentially regulated genes in microarray. WT or Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were treated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) or vehicle (Veh) for 24 h following which the mice were euthanized, lungs removed for protein and RNA extraction as described in Materials and Methods. Whole lung homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting . Immunoblot showed increased expression of JmjD3, Spata 13 and ODC1 in the PA exposed lungs of the WT mice compared to Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Clec1A expression was significantly decreased in Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 exposed to PA, compared to WT PA infected mouse lung. Western blots probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the corresponding total protein Alpha-NF-kBIA), and epithelial-specific transcription factor (ESE-1/ELF3) were up-regulated. In addition, several inflammatory response genes, including monocyte chemotactic protein MCP-1 (CCL2) and TNF-\u03b1-induced protein A20 (TNFAIP3) were up-regulated [49] . The DPH1 gene, whose product catalyzes conversion of histidine residues to diphthamide in elongation factor 2 was also upregulated. Further, genes involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways that displayed altered expression, such as RhoB GTPase (RHOB), JAK-1 (JAK1), and c-Jun (JUN) were elevated. Our in vivo results are in accordance with the above finding. For instance, expression of Nfkbia, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Elf3, Ccl2, Tnfaip3 genes were up-regulated in WT mice treated with PA compared to other groups. The Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 PA group showed significant degree of protection accompanied by lack of activation of the aforementioned genes belonging to NF-kB activation pathway (Fig. 4) . However, no significant changes were noted with respect to the expression of Dph-1, Rhob, Jak1 or c-Jun genes in WT PA group.",

Ichikawa et al also reported PKC family genes to be up-regulated by PA in epithelial cells (39) . In another study, it has been observed that PA activates PKC \u03b1 to invade middle ear epithelial cells [51] . Activation of PKC \u03b1 by its phosphorylation in human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEEC) was associated with actin condensation, and blocking the PKC pathway attenuated the ability of bacteria to invade HMEECs and subsequent actin condensation. In our study we noted significant differential regulation of genes in the PKC pathway. A similarity between the two studies was noted in that infection by PA in WT mouse caused upregulation of genes promoting inflammation and apoptosis. PKC \u03b4 (Prkcd) was significantly up-regulated in WT PA compared to the rest of the group. Also, upregulation of other members of the PKC pathway such as Sele, which promotes adhesion of leucocytes [34] , Lcp2 the product of which mediates T-cell receptor mediated signal transduction [52] , Nr4a1 the product of which upon translocation from nucleus to mitochondria causes apoptosis [35] was observed. However, PA infection leads to significant downregulation of genes in the PKC pathway including Gna11 encoding the protein belonging to the family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which function as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems and Prkcz, encoding protein kinase c \u0396, a member of the PKC family of serine/threonine kinases. In the present study, we also observed downregulation of RAS Guanylyl Releasing Protein 2 gene expression and the corresponding protein activates small GTPases, including RAS and RAP1/RAS3 [53, 54] . In this manuscript we have delved into the genomics of Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 as the mechanism of PA infection stimulating phosphorylation of SPHK2 mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) \u03b4 and its localization in epithelial cell nucleus has already been described by us [11] .",

            "text": "Recent studies have shed light on the role played by bacterial pathogens in reprograming host genome by influencing epigenetic factors [57] . Gene modification at epigenetic level holds the potential to alter the response of the host to future infections. PA has been shown to induce early T3SS-dependent dephosphorylation and deacetylation of histone H3 in eukaryotic cells. Epigenetic regulation of genes following PA infection is an interesting finding of ours in that it can have far reaching implications beyond immediate infection. PA infection caused downregulation of Histone1H2bc (Hist1h2bc) gene, which encodes a member of the histone 1H2B family. Histone1 families of proteins interact with linker DNA between nucleosomes aiding the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. Fig. 13 Validation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) inoculum by BAL culture post-inoculation. PA was inoculated into the trachea at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mouse and following administration BAL was collected at 6 or 24 h, post-inoculation and plated out on sheep blood agar plates. Bacterial colony count was done after 24 h. We noted that there was no significant difference following administration of PA by intratracheal route as the BAL at 6 or 24 h showed comparable number of bacterial colony count suggesting no difference in the bacterial load inoculated. WT mice showed a mean colony count of 46.3 \u00d7 10 4 /ml and the Sphk2 KO 44.55 \u00d7 10 4 / ml at 6 h post-inoculation and at 24 h WT had a mean colony count of 3.05 \u00d7 10 4 /ml and Sphk2 KO, 3.16 \u00d7 10 4 /ml This protein, which has antibacterial and antifungal activity, was significantly down-regulated in the WT mice but preserved in the Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 . This could contribute to the protection seen in the Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 . Downregulation of Runx1T1 along with that of Hist1h2bc is important because Runx1 translocation partner 1 belongs to a family of transcriptional corepressors that interact with both transcription factors bound to promoters of target genes and with histone deacetylases (HDACs). Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with PA did not reveal any downregulation of the aforementioned genes in the epigenetic pathway. Interestingly, PA infection of WT mouse lung inhibited HDAC1/2 activity, and enhanced H3 and H4 histone acetylation, however, genetic deletion of Sphk2 in mice attenuated PA mediated H3 and H4 histone acetylation [11] . Further, S1P generated in the nucleus of lung epithelial cells by SPHK2 after exposure to heatinactivated PA modulated HDAC1/2 activity that was blocked by inhibition of SPHK2 activity with a specific inhibitor, ABC 294640 [11] , thus confirming the microarray and PW analysis data.",

Our study did not show any differential regulation of ENaC genes per se but members of the EnaC pathway genes, for example, the epithelial sodium channel Furin and endothelin1 (End 1) were up-regulated in the WT PA group. Furin plays an important role in the activation of exotoxin A, which is a major virulence factor of PA [59, 60] . Endocytosed exotoxin A is processed by Furin and is transported retrograde to the endoplasmic reticulum. The toxin activates Pseudomonas exotoxin A by specific cleavage and inhibits protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, triggering cell death [61] . As noted earlier, WT PA group was associated with up-regulation of Furin gene unlike similarly treated Sphk2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7) . This indicates that PA-induced activation of Furin is somehow dependent on SphK2 gene activity and could be the principal mechanism through which host combats PA infection. Further studies are in progress to validate the above hypothesis. We suggest that the biological phenomenon of reduced intensity of PA pneumonia in the Sphk2 KO mice could involve multiple pathways and the significant ones identified in our analyses is presented here.",

            "text": "This study sheds light on the key role played by SPHK2 in facilitating the PA infection in the host and how the 'hijacking' of the host genome by the invading organism can be resisted by blocking the SPHK2/S1P pathway. PA infection caused significant upregulation of the genes related to NF-\u03baB pathway and members of the PKC family. Also, PA infection up-regulated Furin gene, which plays a critical role in the activation of exotoxin A, a major virulence factor of PA. This study specifically gives information on the differential expression of genes following PA in an in vivo system lacking Sphk2 gene showing protection against PA pneumonia. Further mechanistic studies are required to prove the hypotheses that could be derived from the genomic information provided by this study. Translational application of the SPHK2 pathway has the potential to have far reaching implications in the therapy of PA infection in CF patients by two mechanisms such as 1) Targeting the SPHK2 pathway mediated pathology and 2) Reducing the virulence of the organism by resisting its alteration of the host genome. Further understanding of this novel mechanism can be harnessed to overcome the virulence of the organism thus opening up new avenues in the therapy of PA infections across various species.",
