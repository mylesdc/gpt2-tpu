            "text": "Results: Sixty-three MERS patients were admitted to 3 MERS-designated ICUs during the outbreak (peak census = 27 patients on August 25, 2015, and the last new case on September 13, 2015). Most patients had multiorgan failure. Eight HCWs had MERS requiring ICU admission (median stay = 28 days): Seven developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, four were treated with prone positioning, four needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 63.4 % (0 % for the HCWs). In response to the outbreak, the number of negative-pressure rooms was increased from 14 to 38 rooms in 3 MERS-designated ICUs. Patients were managed with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:0.8. Infection prevention practices were intensified. As a surrogate, surface disinfectant and hand hygiene gel consumption increased by ~30 % and 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day on average. Family visits were restricted to 2 h/day. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, all reported to work normally. During the outbreak, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS-designated ICUs reported upper respiratory symptoms, and were tested for MERS-CoV. Only 2/196 (1.0 %) ICU nurses and 1/80 (1.3 %) physician tested positive, had mild disease and recovered fully. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians. Conclusions: Our hospital outbreak of MERS resulted in 63 patients requiring organ support and prolonged ICU stay with a high mortality rate. The ICU response required careful facility and staff management and proper infection control and prevention practices. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is a recently identified virus that is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] , causes severe hypoxemic respiratory failure with multiorgan failure and frequently requires admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [2, 3] . As of September 27, 2016 , the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1806 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 643 related deaths [4] . The majority (~80 %) of MERS cases occurred in Saudi Arabia [4] , where several hospital outbreaks happened [5, 6] with 45 % of all cases taking place within healthcare facilities [7] . The outbreak in the Republic of Korea illustrated the global threat of this disease. It started in May 2015 and resulted from a case with travel history to the Arabian Peninsula [4] . Human-to-human transmission occurred to close contacts [family members, other patients and healthcare workers (HCWs)] and led to 186 cases of MERS-CoV infections with 19 % fatality rate. In our hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh, an outbreak of MERS disease occurred in August to September 2015 [4] , led to significant disruption of hospital functions and resulted in 130 MERS cases [8] with 63 patients requiring ICU admission. The outbreak was attributed to crowding, movement of infected but undiagnosed patients and breaches in infection prevention and control practices [4] . Details of the hospital outbreak have been published elsewhere [8] .",

The objective of this study was to describe the response of the ICU to a hospital MERS outbreak, the associated changes in its workflow and the impact on its HCWs.",

The Department also provided coverage to boarding patients in the 15-bed Resuscitation Area in the Emergency Department (ED). The hospital had also an 8-bed Burn ICU. The ICUs were operated as closed units with 24-h, 7-day onsite coverage by boardcertified critical care intensivists [9] . Normally, 5 medical teams covered the units during the day with each team consisting of one intensivist consultant, one registrar/ fellow and 1-3 residents. The nurse-to-patient ratio in all the ICUs was mostly 1:1. One certified respiratory therapist covered a maximum of six ventilated patients. Additionally, the department had a rapid response team, which covered the hospital wards and was activated according to predefined criteria and is covered by a sixth separate team [10] .",

Among our 63 critically ill MERS patients, the initial MERS-CoV testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs in 29 and deep tracheal aspirates in the rest (n = 34). In the first sample, MERS-CoV was detected in only 6/29 (20.7 %) nasopharyngeal samples and 26/34 (76.5 %) deep tracheal aspirates. After initial negative or equivocal nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 23), a second nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 16 patients (positive in 37.5 %) and deep tracheal aspirate in 5 (positive in 100 %). Our microbiology laboratory extended its working hours and prioritized testing samples coming from the ICU and the rest of the hospital. The number of MERS-CoV tests performed on ICU patients went up from an average of 1.5 before to 5.3 per day during the outbreak with a maximum of 19 tests on September 4, 2015. In patients with suspected MERS and negative rRT-PCR, the test was repeated after 1-2 days.

Also 4 of them required continuous Table 2) . The care was also associated with significant exposure risk. This can be reflected in the duration of mechanical ventilation for the HCWs who required intubation (7-57 days) and length of ICU stay (7-63 days) ( Table 2) . During the outbreak, the nurse-to-patient ratio was mostly 1:1 except for one patient on ECMO (2:1). Additionally, 1-2 additional nurses were deployed in each unit to assist in procedures such as prone positioning and to monitor and correct infection control practices. In unit A, for instance, the nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:1.2 before the outbreak and became 1:0.8 during the outbreak. We restricted medical management to the attending physicians, senior registrars and critical care fellows. Rotating residents were not allowed to work in the ICU during the outbreak. Entry of nonclinical staff, such as research coordinators, was restricted and the ongoing clinical trials were put on hold, except for MERS studies, to reduce staff exposure. During the outbreak, concerns among ICU staff were raised about acquiring MERS and transmitting the virus to their families; a concern that was substantiated by seeing hospital workers infected and developing critical illness. However, many felt privileged to be part ICU team managing the outbreak and taking care of MERS patients; none refused to report to work as per schedule. Two pregnant ICU nurses were redeployed to low-risk units. Staff members who developed fever, respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal illness were asked not to present to work, but rather to report to the ED or the Employee Health Clinic depending on their illness severity. Of the 152 bedside nurses covering Units A and B, 41 (27.0 %) nurses had symptoms of acute respiratory infection during the outbreak and consequently had nasopharyngeal swabs obtained for MERS-CoV; all tested negative. Their total sick leave duration was 138 days (range: 1-15 days per nurse). In comparison, in the 2 months before the outbreak, 26 (17.1 %) nurses had sick leaves for a total of 33 days (range 1-2 days per nurse). Of the 49 nonresident ICU physicians, 9 (18.4 %) physicians received sick leave for a total of 30 days (range 3-4 days per physician). In Unit C, two nurses (1.0 %) of 196 nurses who worked in MERS units (Units A, B and C) and one rotating resident (1.3 %) out of 80 physicians covering the ICUs tested positive for MERS-CoV. The resident and one of the nurses were symptomatic and required hospitalization in a MERS ward for approximately 1 week and both recovered fully.",

Its presenting symptoms overlap with those of other severe acute respiratory illnesses and include fever (71 %), cough (68 %), dyspnea (66 %) and diarrhea (32 %) [17] , often in older adults with preexisting chronic comorbidities [17, 18] . Common laboratory abnormalities include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes [17] . The initial chest radiographs show minimal abnormality to extensive bilateral infiltrates [17] . Unfortunately, many frontline physicians are unfamiliar with the MERS case definition, probably because cases are sporadic, leading to delayed or even missed diagnosis. Delayed recognition may lead to exposing many other patients, visitors and HCWs to the infection as it was the case in our hospital. MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission is thought to be via respiratory droplets, and contact spread is suspected [19] . In Korea, the delayed diagnosis of an infected traveler to the Arabian Peninsula led to 186 MERS cases and resulted in intraand inter-hospital transmission [20] . In Saudi Arabia, 45 % of MERS cases were acquired in the healthcare setting with 12 % of all cases being HCWs [7] . Therefore, taking a detailed history, knowing MERS case definitions, standardizing pneumonia workup, obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens [21] and implementing droplet isolation for suspected cases are crucial interventions to break the transmission chain in the healthcare setting.",

During an outbreak, clinical engineering should have expedient plans to convert standard rooms. Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may be a solution [16] . Outbreaks can lead to significant increase in the need for ICU beds, but may simultaneously reduce the available beds. The SARS outbreak in Toronto led to 10-day closures of 35 ICU beds, which represented 38 % of the tertiary-care university medical-surgical ICU beds in Toronto [16] . Hence, hospitals should always have plans to augment ICU bed capacity, such as by transforming general wards. The ability of any hospital to deal with an infectious outbreak is decided by the availability of ICU beds [23] . Caring for MERS patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staff because of three reasons: high exposure dose, long daily contact hours and prolonged ICU stay with viral shedding. MERS-CoV patients requiring ICU admission have higher viral load than other MERS patients [24] . Aerosol-generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation, suctioning and bronchoscopy, add to the exposure and transmission risk [25] . Extended bedside care is needed for MERS patients due to the requirement of organ support such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, continuous renal replacement therapy, prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [2, 3] . In this study, we observed an increase in the nurse-to-patient ratio from 1:1.2 to approximately 1:0.8 during the outbreak. The SARS epidemic was also associated with increases in the nurse-topatient ratio [26] . Stay in the ICU can last for weeks [3] , which we observed. Additionally, MERS-CoV shedding can be prolonged and may last for >30 days [27] .",

N95 respirator fit testing should be performed at hiring of new staff and done for all other staff before any outbreak. Although fit testing was required for all staff, many did not have fit testing done. However, in response to the outbreak, fit testing was performed to all staff and powered air-purifying respirators were provided to those who failed fit testing. Strict infection prevention and control practices should be implemented and audited. This was performed in our units. Repetitive training is recommended [31] .

It included intubation, early prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade for moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome as these interventions have been shown to improve the outcomes of ARDS patients [32, 33] . Although noninvasive ventilation use was discouraged, it was used in 12 patients. The WHO considers noninvasive ventilation an option in selected MERS cases [15] . It should be used as a short trial without delaying intubation if unsuccessful [15] . Moreover, high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula may be another option [15, 34] ; however, the associated transmission risk as a result of aerosol generation is unknown. Systematic corticosteroids, ribavirin and interferon were avoided as they have no proven benefit [15, 35] . Our MERS patients had high mortality (63 %). The previously reported mortality of MERS patients who had critical illness ranged from 58 to 84 % [2, 3, 18] . None of our HCWs who developed MERS died, which was gratifying to our staff.",

Hand hygiene and personal protective equipment practices should be monitored. Education should be repeated periodically All healthcare workers should be fit-tested for N95 respirators on hire with the result documented in their files. Periodic audit of this requirement should be done Hospitals should make plans to acutely increase personal protective equipment supplies as consumption increases tremendously during an infectious disease outbreak Hospital and ICU leaders should have plans to cover healthcare workers who are exposed or become symptomatic to avoid potential staff shortage",
