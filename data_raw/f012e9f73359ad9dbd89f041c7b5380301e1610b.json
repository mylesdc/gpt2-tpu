Unfortunately, we still do not know how many species of rats and mice occur in China, or which species carry what pathogens, even for the most common genera such as Apodemus and Rattus. The reasons for this are complicated. Both Apodemus and Rattus have complex evolutionary and taxonomic histories, with classifications continuously being updated. Switching between valid species and synonyms causes considerable confusion, especially for non-specialist researchers. Furthermore, many species occur only in remote mountains or near national borders with high species diversity, such as Yunnan, Xizang (Tibet), and Xinjiang. Indeed, the rats and mice of southern Xizang and western Xinjiang remain to be studied carefully. Finally, many rodents are difficult to identify to species level due to the number of morphologically similar species (Galan et al., 2012) .",

Several scenarios for the classification of Apodemus have been proposed (Filippucci, 1992; Martin et al., 2000; Musser et al., 1995; Serizawa et al., 2000; Zimmermann, 1962) , but none are strongly supported, and phylogenies remain poorly resolved despite molecular efforts (Liu et al., 2004; Serizawa et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the number of species in China remains unknown, with previous estimations varying from six (Corbet, 1978; Xia, 1984) , seven (Liu et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2004) , eight (Smith et al., 2008) , and nine species (Nowak, 1999; Wang, 2003) . Many authors have suggested that A. sylvaticus occurs in Xinjiang, China (Corbet, 1978; Xia, 1984; Wang, 2003) , whereas others have argued that the species is A. uralensis (Smith et al., 2008) . The former species occurs in Western Europe (Bousbouras, 1999; Machol\u00e1n et al., 2001; Mezhzherin & Zykov, 1991; Michaux et al., 1996) , and its incorrect identification in China likely relates to outdated taxonomy.",

However, several diagnostic characters on the upper molars were constructive in classification, including the number of lingual angles of the first and second upper molar, presence/absence of cusp t3 on the first upper molar, and numbers of internal lobes on the third upper molars. We also cross-checked results based on morphological diagnoses with molecular sequences (when available) to refine identification. All specimens were identified by the same researcher (SYL) for consistency.

The software blasted each sequence against the GenBank nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database. When pairwise identity between the query (our sequence) and subject (in GenBank) sequences was higher 98%, Geneious considered them as the same species. We cross-checked the results of both morphological and molecular identifications, and when the identification was inconsistent, we revisited the skin and skull specimens before applying an identity.",

The PC1 and PC2 plot ( Figure 2A ) did not clearly separate the species. Apodemus latronum plotted on the positive regions of PC1 and PC2, indicating a large body, long tail, long hindfeet, and long ears. In accordance with its small skull and small external measurements, A. uralensis occurred along the negative regions of PC1 and PC2. The sister-or closely related species A. agrarius and A. chevrieri as well as A. pallipes and A. uralensis were well separated, but both pairs overlapped with A. peninsulae, A. draco, and A. ilex, which, in turn, largely overlapped. For the second PCA, using eight craniodental measurements (n=141), the first principal component accounted for 69.5% of variation (eigenvalue=5.6; Table 2 , b). The other principal components accounted for less than 9.4% (eigenvalue\u22640.75) of total variation, indicating they were not stable (Shankardass, 2000) . Seven variables were positively correlated with PC1 (loading>0.56), except for UMRL (loading=0.076), which was positively correlated with PC2 (loading=0.93). The PC1 and PC2 plot ( Figure 2B ) was similar to the previous plot. None of these species were clearly separated from all others. Apodemus chevrieri and A. latronum plotted on the positive regions of PC1, indicating a relatively large skull, and A. uralensis occurred along the negative region of PC1 in accordance with its small skull. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the seven species differed significantly (P<0.05) in all external and cranial characters tested, except for NBL (P=0.497), TL (P=0.064), and HFL (P=0.094). Results showed significant differences as follows: UTRL, MRL, ABL, and ML between A. peninsulae and A. chevrieri; ZB, SBL, UTRL, HBL, and EL between A. peninsulae and A. ilex; SGL, ZB, SBL, HBL, TL, HFL, and EL between A. peninsulae and A. draco; ZB, SBL, and ABL between A. peninsulae and A. pallipes; SGL, ZB, SBL, UTRL, ABL, ML, HBL, and EL between A. chevrieri and A. ilex; SGL, ZB, SBL, MRL, UTRL, ABL, ML, HBL, TL, and HFL between A. chevrieri and A. draco; SGL, ZB, SBL, UTRL, MRL, ABL, and ML between A. chevrieri and A. pallipes; TL and HFL between A. ilex and A. draco; and ABL, TL, and HFL between A. draco and A. pallipes. Thus, morphological analysis indicated that the eight species of Apodemus could be separated by the 12 morphological characters, validating the taxonomic status of these species in China. ",

The unresolved relationships within Apodemus were not surprising and are likely due to early radiation in the evolution of this genus, as indicated by the saturation of the mitochondrial gene (Serizawa et al., 2000) .

Despite uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships, questions regarding taxonomy in both genera remain. The differences between A. pallipes and A. uralensis have been discussed previously in depth (Musser & Carleton, 2005) . Our carefully identified specimens of A. pallipes were from southern Xizang (Pulan County). The average cyt b genetic distance between A. uralensis and A. pallipes was 5.4%, which was the smallest interspecific genetic distance in Apodemus. All our specimens of A. pallipes matched the original description and holotype (Musser & Carleton, 2005) . Thus, A. pallipes undoubtedly occurs in China. The sequences of A. pallipes in GenBank were from Afghanistan and Pakistan, near the type locality of A. pallipes in Pamir Alta. However, as we had no access to these specimens, it was not possible to determine if they matched the morphological description of A. pallipes. Johnson & Jones (1955) described A. chejuensis. Koh (1991) also recognized the species based on its large body size and mtDNA genotype. Corbet (1978) assigned it as a synonym of A. agrarius ningpoensis, whereas Musser & Carleton (2005) treated it as a synonym of A. agrarius. Our phylogeny embedded A. chejuensis in A. agrarius, and thus our results agree with the assignment of Musser & Carleton (2005) .",

Further, our ANOVA results demonstrated significant differences in TL and HFL between A. ilex and A. draco.

            "text": "Hodgson described R. pyctoris in 1845 from Nepal (Hodgson, 1845) . This name was later replaced by R. rattoides or R. turkestanicus. Musser & Carleton (1993) resurrected the oldest name and it has been reported to occur in China (Allen, 1940; Corbet, 1978; Ellerman & Morrison-Scott, 1951; Musser & Carleton, 1993 , 2005 Wang, 2003) . Feng et al. (1986) identified a series of specimens of R. pyctoris from Xizang and claimed that R. pyctoris closely resembled R. rattus but with a pale underbelly, relatively long nasal bone, and cusp t3 on M 1 . Our series of specimens from Xizang coincide with the characteristics of R. pyctoris described by Feng et al. (1986) . However, phylogenetic analysis associated the species with R. nitidus. The original description and comments of Musser & Carleton (2005) on R. pyctoris point to its diagnostic characters as a very small cusp t3 on M 1 , a wide and short rostrum (narrow and slender in R. nitidus), and chunky wide molars (thinner and gracile in R. nitidus). Except for the morphology of M 1 , the Xizang specimens differed from R. pyctoris. Furthermore, many characters of the Xizang specimens also differed from R. nitidus, including the cusp t3 being present, gray-white underbelly, and larger measurements. The molecular phylogeny also placed the Xizang specimens and R. nitidus in different clades. Accordingly, we assign the Xizang specimens to a new, undescribed subspecies of R. nitidus. Peale (1848) described R. exulans from Society Island. Nevertheless, its existence in Taiwan, China has been recognized for a long time (Motokawa et al., 2001) . The Guangdong Insects Institute collected specimens of R. exulans from Yongxing Island in 1975. Rattus exulans is the smallest Asian species in its genus. The specimens from Yongxing Island conformed to the characteristics of R. exulans. Thus, we confirm that R. exulans occurs in China in Yongxing Island and Taiwan.",

Notwithstanding, it was possible to identify some species based on morphology alone, such as, R. andamanensis, which has a unique white belly, R. norvegicus, which has very short ears, and R. nitidus and R. norvegicus, which do not have the cusp t3 on M 1 , with the former also having distinctly larger ears. The Chinese population of R. rattus is black all over its body, whereas R. exulans only occurs in islands of the South China Sea, including Taiwan, and has a very small head and body length. However, R. losea and R. tanezumi occur sympatrically in southern China. They are easily confused due to similar appearances and overlapping measurements. Most species showed significant overlap in the PCA plots ( Figure 3A, B) . Perhaps due to challenges in identification, GenBank contains many misidentifications.
