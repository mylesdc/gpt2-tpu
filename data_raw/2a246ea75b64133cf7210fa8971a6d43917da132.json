However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points. In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg). We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment. Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing. These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses. In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses.",

            "text": "Several lectins isolated from natural sources inhibit microbial and viral pathogens both in vitro and in vivo [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Griffithsin (GRFT), derived from the red alga Griffithsia sp., is a homodimeric lectin with a total of six oligosaccharide binding sites recognizing terminal oligomannose residues on asparagine (N)-linked Man 5-9 -GlcNAc 2 structures [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Interestingly, oligomannose structures constitute the vast majority of N-linked glycans in the HIV-1 glycan shield [12, 13] , and help the virus evade immune surveillance [14] . Griffithsin inhibits HIV-1 in vitro with an EC 50 in the mid-picomolar range [7, 15, 16] , with nanomolar activity against several other enveloped viruses such as acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) [3, [17] [18] [19] . GRFT binds oligosaccharides to multiple sites on a single molecule [11] , thereby occluding functionally important domains of the viral envelope glycoprotein, preventing interactions with cell-surface receptors and impeding structural transitions indispensable for infection initiation. As demonstrated with HSV-2, GRFT may also act by inhibiting virus egress and spread post-infection in vitro [17] . Importantly, GRFT's antiviral activity has been confirmed in pre-exposure prophylaxis animal models, with the lectin inhibiting HSV-2, SARS-CoV, JEV, and HCV [3, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . This potent activity of GRFT is coupled with an excellent safety profile as shown in vitro and in several animal models [15, 22, 23] . Taken together, GRFT's tolerability profile and broad spectrum activity against susceptible viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, advocate for its further development as an antiviral chemopreventative or chemotherapeutic.",

            "text": "Since serum GRFT concentrations peaked at 4 h post bolus dosing, and persisted up to 96 h, daily subcutaneous self-administration would maintain potential therapeutic effects. Understanding GRFT's pharmacokinetics is very critical for future studies. Given that subcutaneous dosing may be viable in maintaining potentially therapeutic drug concentrations, the following parameters should be assessed: steady-state drug concentrations, loading doses, maintenance doses, and dosing intervals. GRFT's EC 50 for HIV is approximately 40 pM [7] . Based on 0.06 L/h clearance determined for single 10 mg/kg subcutaneous dose, administration of 2.5 mg/kg GRFT every 72 h would achieve a steady-state concentration of 47 nM, over 1000 times the EC 50 for HIV-1. However, GRFT has higher EC 50 for HCV (4 nM) [3] and SARS-CoV EC 50 (48 nM) [19] , indicating that optimal regimens should be determined for various viral diseases, maintaining serum drug concentrations at therapeutic steady-state levels while avoiding toxicities. More frequent regimens could also be designed based on these data, to minimize peak and trough drug levels while maintaining potentially effective steady-state serum concentrations. For instance, a steady state concentration of 47 nM would require 35 \u00b5g/h or 840 \u00b5g/day to be administered. Interestingly, GRFT amounts dosed subcutaneously affected its bioavailability: at 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively, GRFT displayed 43 and 90% bioavailability rates (AUC subcutaneous )/AUC intravenous ). Although the underlying reasons remain unclear, these findings highlight the impact of dose selection on study design. It should be noted that only active GRFT was detected in this study. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory have shown that GRFT may bind some proteins in the plasma. However, how such binding affects the actual detection of GRFT deserves further attention. Using more sensitive measurements of the lectin, e.g., mass spectrometry or performing treatments with the radiolabeled compound would provide additional insights. Such experiments will be carried out in future studies.",

Nevertheless, active GRFT concentrations present in feces indicate it could be used orally to prevent the rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other pathogens such as HSV-2. Indeed, the non-absorption of GRFT after oral administration allowed for a drug fraction to pass through the digestive tract, ultimately being expelled in fecal material (Figure 4 ). Approximately 1% of initial GRFT amount was recovered in the feces; shielding the lectin from stomach acid and protease effects might increase the excreted amounts. Nonetheless, GRFT fecal levels exceeded its EC 50 toward HIV-1 within the first 24 h post treatment.",

Interestingly, GRFT passage following oral dosage was consistent with the typical intestinal transit time of 20-30 h [36] .
