We have combined proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by facilitating ribosome recruitment. Our data uncovers a novel function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifies the first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity.",

They replicate on host derived membranous vesicles that are induced following viral infection, the formation of which requires the activity of key membrane bound viral enzymes (Altan-Bonnet, 2017) . Within the membrane bound viral replication complex, translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. Positive sense RNA viruses have evolved novel gene expression mechanisms that enable them to overcome the genome size limitations that accompany error-prone replication and which might restrict their overall coding capacity (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . In addition, viral modification of the host cell translation machinery often provides a competitive advantage allowing for the efficient translation of viral RNA in an environment where competing cellular RNAs are in abundance (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017) . This ability to compete with cellular RNAs is particularly important for the initiation of infection where the incoming viral genome may be present at only a single copy per cell.",

The economic impact of HuNoV is estimated to be at least~$4.2 billion in direct health care costs, with wider societal costs of~$60 billion (Bartsch et al., 2016) . Despite their socioeconomic impact, we have, until very recently lacked a detailed understanding of much of the norovirus life cycle and many significant questions remain unanswered. HuNoV replicons (Chang et al., 2006) , a murine norovirus that replicates in cell culture (Karst et al., 2003; Wobus et al., 2004) and the recent B cell (Jones et al., 2014) , stem-cell derived organoid (Ettayebi et al., 2016) and zebrafish larvae infection models (Van et al., 2019) , have all provided invaluable tools to dissect the norovirus life cycle. However, due to the technical limitations associated with many of these experimental eLife digest The human norovirus (also known as the winter vomiting bug) is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and is responsible for the deaths of many children in developing countries. Norovirus infections are estimated to have an economic cost of over 60 billion US dollars per year, yet there are no vaccines or drugs to prevent or limit the spread of outbreaks. In most cases norovirus infections last only a few days but, in people with weakened immune systems, infections can last from months to years.",

The virus is unable to multiply on its own and so it infects the cells of its host and hijacks them to make new viral proteins and RNA. Host cells have their own RNA molecules, which provide the instructions that cellular machines called ribosomes need to make proteins. Recent work reported that a norovirus protein called VPg interacts with the host cells' ribosomes to recruit them to produce proteins from the viral genome. However, it remained unclear which host proteins were important for this key stage of the norovirus life cycle. Hosmillo, Lu, McAllaster et al. combined three different molecular biology and genetic approaches to search for host proteins that help noroviruses to multiply in cells. Any proteins identified in these experiments would be fundamental for the norovirus life cycle, making them potential drug targets for future treatments. The experiments revealed that a protein called G3BP1 was required for noroviruses to multiply efficiently. Previous studies have shown that G3BP1 is a member of a family of proteins that can bind to RNA and play many roles in healthy cells, including helping the cells to adjust the proteins they produce in response to stress. Hosmillo, Lu, McAllister et al. found that G3BP1 helped VPg to recruit ribosomes and the other host components needed to make new proteins from the viral RNA genome.",

In addition, the norovirus VPg proteins contain a highly conserved C-terminal domain which we have shown to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4G via an interaction that requires a highly conserved phenylalanine residue ( Figure 1A ) (Chung et al., 2014; Leen et al., 2016) . Using affinity purification on m7-GTP sepharose, we confirmed that the NV VPg protein, as produced during authentic virus replication in a NV replicon bearing cell line, interacts with the cap-binding complex eIF4F ( Figure 1B) . Components of the eIF4F complex, namely the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4A helicase and the eIF4GI scaffold protein, along with poly-A binding protein (PABP) and eIF3 subunits, were readily purified on m7-GTP sepharose, whereas GAPDH was not. In NV-replicon containing cells, mature VPg was also enriched on m7-GTP sepharose but the NS3 protein, known to have RNA binding and helicase activity (Li et al., 2018) , was not. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transfection of GFPtagged versions of either the MNV or NV VPg proteins into 293 T cells allowed for the affinity purification of eIF4F components and that mutations in the eIF4G binding domain of VPg reduced this association ( Figure 1C) .",

These data agrees with but significantly extend our previous observations using a less sensitive multi-step affinity purification approach to characterise host factors associated with the MNV VPg protein only (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2014) . In addition, we identified hnRNPA1 which we have previously shown to act in norovirus genome circularization (L\u00f3 pez-Manr\u00edquez et al., 2013) . YBX1, DDX3 and several other proteins that we have previously found to interact with the 5' end of the viral RNA (Vashist et al., 2012a) were also enriched on VPg (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). To validate a select number of these interactions and to assess whether the interaction of VPg with eIF4G is required for their association with VPg, we performed western blot analysis of complexes purified from cells transfected with either the WT or eIF4G-binding mutants ( Figure 1E ). Except for YBX1, the association of all proteins tested were reduced by the introduction of eIF4G-binding site mutations into the MNV VPg protein. Together, these data extend our previous observations and confirm that the norovirus VPg proteins interact with a complex network of host factors, many of which have been implicated in the host cell translation initiation process.",

The experiment was performed three times by swapping the labelled derivatives of arginine and lysine as described in the Materials and methods. Silver stain of the purified complexes confirmed the presence of the bait proteins, with both the uncleaved and cleaved forms of NS1/2 and NS2 being highly enriched ( Figure 2B ). As expected, complexes purified from NS1/2-Flag virus infected cells co-purified untagged NS4 and vice versa ( Figure 2B ), as we have previously shown these proteins to interact to form a complex (Thorne et al., 2012) .

We noted that anti-NS4 monoclonal antibody was unable to detect protein in the extracts prior to enrichment, which most likely reflected the limited sensitivity of the antibody. Quantitative mass spectrometry of the purified complexes allowed the identified of viral and cellular proteins enriched in the complex ( Figure 2D and Supplementary file 2).",

In contrast, NS1/2 effectively pulled down mature VPg ( Figure 2C and S2.2). Consistent with this, NS1/2 enriched the VPg binding partner eIF4G more than 2-fold, while pulldown of NS4 resulted in no eIF4G enrichment, likely indicating that the NS4/5 (VPg) precursor cannot effectively function in translation initiation (Figure 2-figure supplement 2). This is consistent with a previous observation that binding of C-terminal VPg fusion proteins to eIF4G is inhibited , but may further suggest that the function of VPg is also altered when present as an N-terminal fusion with NS4. Comparison with the proteomics data obtained using VPg as a bait protein ( Figure 1 ) showed some degree of overlap with our replication complex proteome data ( containing complexes from either wild-type BHK cells (BHK) or BHK cells containing the Norwalk virus (NV) replicon (BHK-NV).

Samples of the input lysates (Input) and the purified complexes (GFP-IP) were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blot analysis for the indicated proteins.

The Brie library was selected due to the reduced off-target effects relative to previously described CRISPR libraries used for norovirus studies (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016) . In addition, to minimise the impact of gRNAs that may have deleterious effects on long term cell viability and to increase our ability to detect genes that may be important, but not essential, for norovirus-induced cell death, the infection was reduced to 24 hr as compared to 2-10 days post infection in previous studies. BV2-Cas9 expressing cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying the Brie gRNA library carrying 78,637 independent guide RNAs to 19,674 genes . The transduced cells were then infected with two MNV strains, CW3 and CR6, which cause acute and persistent infections in immunocompetent mice respectively (Nice et al., 2013; Thackray et al., 2007) , and guide RNA abundance compared to mock infected cells at 24 hr post infection as illustrated in Figure 3A . Genes that were enriched by STARS analysis following MNV infection represent putative pro-viral factors which when disrupted, resulting in slower cell death, whereas those with a negative STARS value represent putative anti-viral factors where virus-induced cell death has occurred quicker, resulting in their underrepresentation in the final pool of cells. MNV-CR6 infection resulted in 212 genes being enriched and 42 being negatively selected ( Figure 3B ), whereas for MNV-CW3 279 and 18 genes were positively and negatively selected respectively ( Figure 3B ). In most cases, there was a clear correlation between the datasets obtained using either strain ( Figure 3C ). STARS analysis was used to ranks genes with positive and negative values with an FDR value less than 0.05 (Supplementary file 4). In both screens, the MNV receptor Cd300lf was the most highly positively selected gene identified, in agreement with previous reports (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016) . The previously characterised pro-viral MNV gene VapA (McCune et al., 2017) was also identified in both screens (Supplementary file 4). The second most highly enriched gene was G3BP1, a gene also identified in one of the two previous CRISPR screens performed on norovirus infected cells .",

The discrepancy between the screens performed here and those in previous studies likely reflects the experimental conditions under which the screens were undertaken that is 24 hr of infection vs 2-3 days in the previous screens. The previous screen was performed under much more stringent conditions that were unlikely to identify proteins that play a role in the norovirus life cycle but are not essential. Pathway over-representation analysis (Liao et al., 2019) of the genes pro-viral genes identified in the CRISPR screens performed in this study highlighted mRNA processing, RNA splicing and methylation as the three most highly represented gene ontology (GO) terms (Supplementary file 4). The gene encoding PTBP1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, was one of the genes identified in these enriched GO terms. PTBP1 is a protein we have previously shown to bind to a 3' pyrimidine-rich stretch in the MNV genome which is important for viral pathogenesis . The interaction of PTBP1 with the viral 3' end also facilitates the recruitment of PTBP1 to the viral replication complex where it contributes to an as yet undefined aspect of the norovirus life cycle (Vashist et al., 2012b) .",

To establish the experimental system, we first confirmed that the presence of VPg on the 5' end of the Norwalk RNA was essential for the replication of the replicon RNA and for the capacity to form G418 resistant colonies. Transfection of replicon RNA, purified from replicon containing cells, into BHK cells readily resulted in the formation of antibiotic resistant cell colonies ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, RNA that was proteinase K treated prior to transfection was unable to produce replicon containing colonies. Transfection of replicon RNA into wild type U2OS osteosarcoma cells allowed the formation of repliconcontaining colonies, although the efficiency of formation was significantly less than that seen in BHK cells ( Figure 5B ). CRISPR modified U2OS cells that lacked G3BP1 (Kedersha et al., 2016) were unable to support NV replication, as evident by the lack of antibiotic resistant colonies ( Figure 5B ). To further examine the role of G3BP1 in human Norwalk virus replication, WT or G3BP1 deficient U2OS cells were transfected with NV replicon VPg-linked RNA, and RNA synthesis monitored overtime following the addition of G418. While a significant increase in NV viral RNA levels was seen in WT U2OS cells, those lacking G3BP1 were completely unable to support NV RNA synthesis ( Figure 5C ). We further validated these observations by transfection of the NV replicon in murine BV2 microglial cells which were able to support HuNoV replication by the formation of small microcolonies of antibiotic resistant cells ( Figure 5D ). In the absence of G3BP1 the formation of antibiotic resistant microcolonies was completely ablated and then subsequently restored in DG3BP1 cells engineered to express the wild type version of G3BP1 ( Figure 5D ). These data indicate that like for MNV, G3BP1 is essential for human Norwalk virus replication.",

The production of viral positive sense RNA was reduced to background levels in the absence of G3BP1, comparable to levels observed when the 2CMC was present during the infection ( Figure 8B ). Viral negative sense RNA synthesis was also reduced to below the detection limit of the assay in DG3BP1 cell lines ( Figure 8C) . Surprisingly, we were able to detect an~5 fold increase in viral negative sense RNA production at 6 hr post infection of WT cells in the presence of 2CMC, which, given that 2CMC was added after the inoculation phase ( Figure 8B ), likely represents the first round of viral negative sense RNA synthesis, confirming the sensitivity of the assay.

Complementation with WT G3BP1, but not the mutant forms lacking the RNA binding domains, also restored viral positive and negative sense RNA synthesis ( Figure 8F and G). We did not detect viral positive or negative sense RNAs in the DRGG complemented cell line, despite the presence of low levels of viral infectivity ( Figure 7B ). This discrepancy likely reflects the relative sensitivities of the assays and the nature of the strand specific qPCR assay which requires low levels of RNA input to maintain strand specificity. Together these data suggest that the function of G3BP1 is prior to, or at the level of viral negative sense RNA synthesis, with the most logical steps being either viral RNA translation or the formation of viral replication complexes.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that norovirus VPg interacts with eIF4G to recruit ribosomal subunits and direct viral translation (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2014) . The interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and does not require any additional cellular cofactors, as a stable complex can be formed between VPg and the eIF4G HEAT domain at least in vitro. The interaction between the eIF4G HEAT domain and the eIF3 complex plays a central role in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation (Marcotrigiano et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2013) . Our proteomics analysis also confirms that the norovirus VPg proteins form a complex that contains multiple components of the large and small ribosomal subunits ( Figure 1D ). It has been established previously that G3BP1 associates with 40S subunits (Kedersha et al., 2016) . To assess a potential role for G3BP1 in the formation of VPg-driven translation complexes in cells, we examined the ability of GFP tagged versions of MNV VPg to pull down ribosomal proteins in the presence and absence of G3BP1. GFP-tagged WT MNV VPg was readily able to pull down eIF4G, G3BP1 and RpS6, a component of the 40S subunit ( Figure 9A ). However, in the absence of G3BP1, the ability to pull down RpS6 and RpS3 was lost ( Figure 9A and Figure 9 figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we found that disruption of the VPg-eIF4G interaction by the introduction of the F123A mutation into the eIF4G binding domain, also significantly reduced the ability to pull down RpS6, RpS3, as well as RpL4, a component of the large ribosomal subunit ( Figure 9B and Figure 9 -figure supplement 1). We also observed that upon reconstitution of G3BP1 expression, the levels of RpS6, RpS3 and RpL4 associated with VPg were enhanced ( Figure 9B and Figure 9 -figure supplement 1). We note however that the levels of ribosomal proteins associated with the GFP-tagged VPg in this assay is relatively low, we think this reflect the fact that in the context of viral infection where VPg is covalently linked to viral RNA, secondary interactions between translation initiation factors and the viral RNA likely stabilise this complex. We have previously seen that the eIF4A protein binds directly to the 5' end of the sapovirus genome (Hosmillo et al., 2016) . Furthermore, eIF4G is known to make secondary stabilising interactions with the template RNA that are critical for translation initiation (Yanagiya et al., 2009 ). Therefore we hypothesise that in the absence of covalently linked viral RNA, the association of VPg with ribosomal subunits is less robust and therefore less able to be maintained during the purification process used in the GFP-Trap approach. Therefore, to assess how the loss of G3BP1 may influence the association of VPg-linked viral RNA with ribosomal subunits in a more physiologically relevant system, we quantified the amount of viral VPg-linked RNA bound to ribosomal subunits by RNA-IP. By inclusion of the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor 2CMC we were able to assess viral RNA association with ribosomal proteins in the absence of viral RNA synthesis. We found that in the absence of G3BP1, the amount of viral RNA associated with the ribosomal subunit protein RpS3 was decreased ( Figure 9C) . These data suggest that that G3BP1 likely contributes in some manner to the association of VPg and viral VPg-linked RNA with ribosomal subunits.",

To this aim, cells were infected with MNV in the presence of 2CMC and polysomes profiling on extracts prepared from cells at 4 and 9 hr post infection performed ( Figure 10A ). Quantification of the viral RNA levels in cells in the presence of 2CMC confirmed that the absence of G3BP1 has no impact on the overall levels present at the time points examined (data not shown).

The fact we observed 80S accumulation in WT cells, even in the absence of viral RNA synthesis, but not in cells lacking G3BP1, indirectly lead us to suspect that translation of viral RNA had occurred in WT cells, but was much less efficient in cells lacking G3BP1. Further analyses indicated that while most ribosome-associated norovirus RNA in WT cells was found in polysomes containing fractions, less viral RNA was found in ribosome-containing fractions (1-12 in Figure 10A and B) in the absence of G3BP1 and, in comparison to WT cells, very little viral RNA was found in fractions containing polysomes ( Figure 10B ). Extending the fractionation to include the free RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes at the top of each gradient confirmed that in the absence of G3BP1 norovirus RNA is less efficient at assembling into polysomal fractions, suggesting a defect at the level of viral protein synthesis ( Figure 10C ). Together these data support the hypothesis that G3BP1 functions to promote the translation of norovirus VPg-linked RNA, by facilitating the association with ribosomal subunits and the formation of polysomes on viral RNA.",

The dual luciferase construct was in vitro transcribed, capped and poly(A) tailed. Renilla luciferase was produced via cap-dependent translation initiation whilst firefly luciferase was synthesised via cap-independent, CrPV IRES-dependent translation ( Figure 11A ). Both cap-dependent ( Figure 11B ) and CrPV IRES-dependent translation ( Figure 11C ) were comparable in extracts prepared from WT and DG3BP1 cell lines ( Figure 11A ). To compare norovirus VPg-dependent translation efficiency between WT and DG3BP1 lysates, viral VPg-linked RNA was first extracted from sucrose cushion-purified MNV virions and the presence of VPg on the viral RNA 5' end confirmed by resistance to XrnI mediated degradation in vitro ( We found that norovirus VPg-dependent translation was reduced in nuclease treated extracts prepared from cells lacking G3BP ( Figure 11D) . Quantification of the levels of multiple viral proteins produced over multiple experiments indicated that translation in nuclease treated extracts was on average reduced by~40-50% because of G3BP1 ablation ( Figure 11E) . A similar reduction in in vitro translation was observed across multiple time points (Figure 11 -figure supplement 1 panel C). This 50% reduction in translation efficiency was also consistently observed in extracts that were not nuclease treated, and therefore contained physiologically relevant levels of cellular mRNAs ( Figure 11F and G).

Our combined approaches resulted in the identification of the core stress granule component G3BP1 as a host protein critical for the replication of both murine and human noroviruses in cell culture. Furthermore, we determined that G3BP1 plays a key role in The orthogonal approaches used in the current study provide an unprecedented insight into the identity of host factors with potential roles in the norovirus life cycle. The detailed proteomic analysis of the viral replication and translation complexes formed during MNV infection ( Figure 2 ) resulted in the identification of several host factors with previously identified roles in the MNV life cycle. We focused our efforts on G3BP1 as it was identified in all three approaches and was also identified in a CRISPR screen published during this study . Furthermore, we have previously shown that feline calicivirus (FCV), a relative of noroviruses within the Vesivirus genus, cleaves G3BP1 to inhibit stress granule formation (Humoud et al., 2016) . In contrast, MNV infection does not result in G3BP1 cleavage and instead forms cytoplasmic foci the composition of which is distinct from canonical stress granules (Brocard et al., 2018) .",

Originally identified as a protein that interacted with Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), more than two decades of research have significantly expanded our knowledge of the multifunctional role in cellular processes. It is now well accepted that G3BPs play a role in cancer cell survival, cancer metastasis and invasion, processing of specific miRNAs and stress granule formation (Reviewed in Alam and Kennedy, 2019). Stress granules are dynamic cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes that form rapidly under stress conditions and within which cellular RNAs are stored in stalled translation complexes (Protter and Parker, 2016) . In the context of viral infection, numerous studies have suggested that many, if not all, viruses must interact in some manner with stress granules as there is growing evidence that the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules is part of the anti-viral defense mechanism (Reviewed in McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017) . Some viruses interact with stress granules to promote viral replication (Cristea et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2016; Panas et al., 2014; Panas et al., 2012) whereas some do so to counteract the inhibitory effect of stress granules on the translation of viral RNA (Panas et al., 2015; White et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Our data suggests that G3BP1 plays a key role in promoting the translation of norovirus VPglinked viral RNA. Positive sense RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to ensure the efficient translation of their viral genomic RNAs in the presence of high concentrations of competing cellular RNAs. These mechanisms include the use of internal ribosome entry site elements (IRES), modified capdependent mechanisms (Firth and Brierley, 2012; Jaafar and Kieft, 2019) and the ability to target the host cell translation machinery to generate an environment where viral RNA translation is favoured over cellular capped RNAs (Walsh et al., 2013) . G3BP1 is thought to associate primarily with free 40S subunits (Kedersha et al., 2016) . Our data supports a hypothesis whereby the association of G3BP1 with 40S ribosomal subunits somehow stabilises the recruitment of a translation initiation complex to the 5' end of the VPg-linked viral RNA genome, promoting VPg-dependent translation and thereby uncovering a new function in virus specific translation. The mechanism by which G3BP1 contributes to this process has yet to be fully explored but our data supports the hypothesis that G3BP1 directly or indirectly promotes the recruitment of ribosomal subunits to VPg-driven Figure 9 continued G3BP1 and ribosomal subunits and the reconstitution of G3BP1 expression in DG3BP1 BV2 cells restores the interaction. GFP-Trap pull downs were performed as described in panel A with the addition of the MNV VPg F123A mutation known to reduce the association with eIF4G and the inclusion of the in DG3BP1 1B2 cell line engineered to express a Flag-tagged derivative of G3BP1. Following the pull down samples were analysed by western blot for presence of the ribosomal subunits using RpS6 and RpL4 as markers for the small and large ribosomal subunits respectively. >denoted the RpL4 proteins; whereas, * indicated the presence of GFP-VPg fusion proteins, present on the same membrane due to the sequential probing of the membrane. (C) Loss of G3BP1 results in decreased association between norovirus RNA and ribosomal proteins.

            "text": "The following figure supplement is available for figure 9: translation complexes. The RGG motif of G3BP1 is known to be essential for the association between G3BP1 and 40S subunits as well as the ability to from stress granules, whereas data would suggest that the RRM may play a regulatory role (Kedersha et al., 2016) . These domains were also required for the function of G3BP1 in the norovirus life cycle (Figure 6 ) confirming that the G3BP1 association with 40S is important for its role in promoting norovirus VPg-dependent translation. Importantly, RGG domains are known to have many functions (Thandapani et al., 2013) and therefore in the context of G3BP1 function in the norovirus life cycle, may also contribute to unknown interactions that promote norovirus translation. Previous work on alphaviruses have shown that G3BP1 is sequestered by binding to the nsP3 protein (Panas et al., 2012; Panas et al., 2014; Panas et al., 2015) . Furthermore, this interaction occurs via an FGDF motif also found in other viral proteins including the ICP8 protein of herpes simplex virus (Panas et al., 2015) . While the MNV VPg protein has a similar motif FGDGF ( Figure 1A) , this motif is not conserved in the GI Norwalk virus VPg protein. Therefore, our data suggest that the interaction of VPg with G3BP1 is not direct, fitting with our observation that this interaction is reduced by mutations in the eIF4G binding domain ( Figure 1A and Figure 9B .) While our data fit with a primary role for G3BP1 in norovirus translation, we are unable to exclude the possibility that G3BP1 plays other roles in the viral life cycle. Recent studies have confirmed that G3BP1 is enriched at sites of viral RNA synthesis (Brocard et al., 2018; Fritzlar et al., 2019) so it is possible that G3BP1 makes multiple contacts between the 40S subunit and viral RNA genome directly. These additional contacts, may further promote viral VPg-dependent translation and/or another aspect of the viral life cycle. The technical challenges associated with studying human norovirus replication in cell culture have limited the experimental approaches we could use to validate the role of G3BP1 in human norovirus translation. However, our results have clearly demonstrated that in the absence of G3BP1, human Norwalk virus is unable to replicate or form replicon-containing colonies. Furthermore we were able to show that BV2 murine microglial cells support the replication of the HuNoV GI replicon, albeit it to a lesser degree than BHK or U20S cells ( Figure 5) . These data confirm that all the machinery necessary for HuNoV replication is conserved between human, hamster and mouse cells. Furthermore, reconstitution of the DG3BP1 BV2 microglial cells with WT G3BP1, at least partially restored the ability of the HuNoV GI replicon to form colonies, confirming the specificity of the effect. The presence of G3BP1 in the NV VPg-containing complexes again fits with our hypothesis that G3BP1 plays a role in promoting viral VPg-dependent protein synthesis.",

The ability of the norovirus protease to cleave PABP and other substrates is also controlled by polyprotein processing and interactions with other viral proteins (Emmott et al., 2019) . Recent work confirms that the preferential viral translation is not driven by the GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a in MNV infected cells (Brocard et al., 2018) . We note however that others have suggested that NS3 may contribute to the translational shut off seen in MNV infected cells (Fritzlar et al., 2019) , with the caveat that this observation was made outside of the context of infected cells and used overexpressed tagged viral proteins. We suspect that noroviruses use multiple mechanisms that work cooperatively to enable the control of host gene expression and the subsequent translation of the cellular mRNAs. The relative contribution of these processes in any given cell type may also vary dependent on the degree to which the cells can sense and respond to viral infection through the induction of innate and apoptotic responses.

            "text": "The observation that many of the factors enriched using the VPg protein were only enriched on complexes purified with NS1/2 tagged infectious MNV, could suggest that the viral proteins present in the viral translation complex are distinct from those present in complexes active for viral RNA synthesis. However, we cannot formally rule out other possible explanations including the possibility that the specific enrichment of translation factors on NS1/2 occurs because NS1/2 is the first protein to be translated from ORF1, therefore unprocessed NS1/2 at the N-terminus of the ORF1 polyprotein being actively translated could function as an anchor, facilitating the enrichment of ribosomes and the associated factors. In addition, we have previously seen that VPg-containing precursors may bind the translation initiation factor eIF4G less well , which could prevent some VPg (NS5) containing precursors associating with translation initiation complexes. Furthermore, the norovirus replication complex contains a number of highly conserved viral protein-viral protein interactions (Emmott et al., 2019) . Within this network of interactions, the NS1/2 protein interacts with the viral RNA polymerase NS7, which in turn binds VPg. It is therefore possible that the interactions observed between the NS1/2 proteins and the host proteins involved in translation, occurs via the formation of a NS1/2-NS7-VPg complex. How the viral protein-protein interactions within the replication complex integrate with the network of cellular proteins identified in the current study and how this facilitates viral replication and/or regulates the host response to infection, remains to be determined.",

As detailed above, we focused our detailed analysis on the role of G3BP1 given that it was identified in all three screens, however it is likely that many of the host factors identified in each screen play key roles in the norovirus life cycle. The high enrichment of proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport, organelle organisation and exocytosis, fits well with our current understanding on the nature of the norovirus replication complex and the impact on host cell processes. Detailed analysis of the impact of norovirus non-structural protein expression and MNV infection on host cell membrane architecture suggests that norovirus replication complexes are generated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and results in the formation of single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs) (Doerflinger et al., 2017) . The process by which the non-structural proteins induce the formation of these structures is unknown, but the NS1/2 and NS4 proteins are thought to be key to the process. We have previously reported that the NS1/2 protein from MNV and HuNoV interacts with the VapA and VapB proteins and that this interaction is required for efficient viral replication (McCune et al., 2017) . The norovirus NS4 protein associates with lipid droplets and is able to drive the formation of SMVs and DMVs (Doerflinger et al., 2017) , suggesting that it may regulate the biosynthetic pathways involved in lipid synthesis or intracellular vesicular transport pathways. Our characterisation of the replication complex indicates an intimate link with numerous proteins involved in vesicle transport and lipid metabolism (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . Given that NS1/2 and NS4 interact to form a complex (Emmott et al., 2019) , it is likely they work in concert to drive the formation of membrane-bound replication complex by regulating the functions of multiple components, the characterisation of which will require further analysis.",
