            "text": "Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5, and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P = 0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin.",

The emergence potential of CoVs is believed to be related to their tendency for mutation and recombination, allowing the generation of new viruses being able to adapt to new hosts 3, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Bats are an important reservoir of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, which may jump to other animals or humans to cause new epidemics 2, 19 . For example, SARS-CoV is likely a recombinant virus originated from horseshoe bats as the primary reservoir and palm civet as the intermediate host 16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Since the SARS epidemic, numerous other novel CoVs from humans or animals have been discovered 2, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , allowing a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of emerging CoVs.",

When the virus was first discovered, it was found to be closely related to Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) previously discovered in lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus) respectively in Hong Kong 3, 11, 33, 34 . Five other lineage C betacoronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV were subsequently detected in bats, including BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013, Hypsugo BatCoV HKU25 from China bats, and coronavirus Neoromicia/PML-PHE1/RSA/2011 (NeoCoV), BtCoVNeo5038/KZN/RSA/2015, and BatCoV PREDICT/PDF-2180 from African bats [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Besides bats, a lineage C betacoronavirus, Erinaceus CoV VMC/DEU, subsequently defined as a novel species, Hedgehog coronavirus 1, has also been discovered in European hedgehogs, a group of animals being phylogenetically closely related to bats 40 . While none of these animal viruses represent the immediate ancestor of MERS-CoV, the spike protein of Ty-BatCoV HKU4 was most closely related to that of MERS-CoV, and was shown to utilize the MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) or CD26, for cell entry 41, 42 . Previous studies have also shown that MERS-CoV was able to infect bat cell lines and Jamaican fruit bats 43, 44 . These findings suggest that bats may be the primary host of the ancestor of MERS-CoV.",

Moreover, cells from the bat hosts of MERS-CoV-related viruses, such as T. pachypus and P. abramus which harbor Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, respectively, were not included in previous studies, which may be due to the geographical limitation of these bat species. To better understand the replicative ability of MERS-CoV in bat cells, which may provide clues on the origin of MERS-CoV, we developed diverse primary bat cell lines from different bat species, including Rhinolophus sinicus (the host of SARSr-Bat-CoV) and T. pachypus (the host of Ty-BatCoV HKU4), and tested their susceptibilities to infection by different strains of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E. The DPP4 mRNA sequences of six bat species and their expression in bat cells were determined to correlate with viral replication results. Our findings showed differential cell tropism between different strains of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E, which offers insights to the origin of MERS-CoV.",

The sequence of M. pusillus was not determined, as RT-PCR for the DPP4 mRNA from bat cells was negative. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bat DPP4 mRNA sequences formed a distinct cluster being closely related to sequences from human and nonhuman primates; while the dromedary camel DPP4 sequence was most closely related to that of wild boar (Fig. 4a ). Previous studies have identified 14 critical residues in hDPP4 for binding of MERS-CoV spike protein 53, 54 . Upon multiple sequence alignment of the corresponding regions that contain these critical residues, most of the residues are conserved in the six bat DPP4 sequences in this study (Fig. 3b) .

            "text": "The present study provides further support to the bat origin of MERS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect cell lines from different animals, including cells from various bat species [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . However, bat cells from host species of MERS-CoV-related viruses, such as T. pachypus and P. abramus which harbor Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, respectively, were not included in these studies. In this study, MERS-CoV EMC/2012 was able to replicate in cells from four different bat genera/species belonging to three different bat families including Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae, and Vespertilionidae. None of these bat cells were previously reported to support MERS-CoV replication. While lineage C betacoronaviruses have not been detected in bats outside the Vespertilionidae family, such diverse cellular tropism should prompt further studies to explore the host diversity of this group of CoVs and hence the possible evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV. In particular, the ability of MERS-CoV to replicate in cells from P. abramus, the host of Pi-BatCoV HKU5, may suggest that the ancestor of MERS-CoV could have originated from Pipistrellus-related bats. Interestingly, MERS-CoV showed the highest replicative ability in cells from R. sinicus. This suggests that MERS-CoV may potentially infect this bat species which is also the natural reservoir of SARSr-CoVs and animal origin of SARS-CoV 21 . Nevertheless, three other MERS-CoV strains belonging to either clade A2 or B3 showed differential replicative abilities in the five bat cell lines that were susceptible to EMC/ 2012 strain (clade A1), with strain D998/15 (clade A2) unable to replicate in all five tested cell lines. Interestingly, it has been shown in a recent study that some clade C MERS-CoV strains from Nigeria and Burkina Faso replicated at a lower titre in Calu-3 cells 52 . This is in line with the present study that our clade A2 strain D998/15 (with its spike gene belonging to clade C), conferred less broad cellular tropism. Our findings suggest that different clades or strains of MERS-CoV may possess different cellular tropism and host range, while all MERS-CoVs can replicate well in the immune-deficient Vero cells.",

Bats are now known to be the recent origin of at least two human CoVs, including SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. SARS-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from horseshoe bats before it jumped to civet as the intermediate host and then human 16, 24 . SARSr-CoVs in bats were shown to utilize the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2), for cell entry 55 . Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E is likely to have originated from bats. CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected in bats of the genus Hipposideros in Africa 56 . More recently, CoVs even closer to HCoV-229E were identified in dromedary camels in the Middle East, which were able to utilize the receptor of HCoV-229E, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) for cell entry 57 . This suggests Recently, a CoV, closely related to HCoV-NL63 in most genome regions except the spike protein, was detected from a bat of the genus Triaenops in Kenya 58 . However, further studies are required to identify even closer relatives of HCoV-NL63 to ascertain its possible bat origin. In contrast to SARSr-CoVs and HCoV-229E which were mainly found in horseshoe and roundleaf bats, respectively, a more diverse host range was observed in lineage C betacoronaviruses. Yet, the different bat species harboring lineage C betacoronaviruses all belonged to the family Vespertilionidae. Specifically, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, Pi-BatCoV HKU5, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, and BtVs-Beta-CoV/SC2013 were detected in bats belonging to the genera, Tylonycteris, Pipistrellus, Hypsugo, and Verspetilio, respectively, in China, whereas NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT/PDF-2180 were detected in bats belonging to Neoromicia and Pipistrellus in Africa 36, 37 . In this study, SARS-CoV could only replicate in R. sinicus kidney cells but not other bat cells, which reflects its evolutionary origin from horseshoe bats. On the other hand, HCoV-229E was unable to replicate in any tested bat cells including cells from Hipposideros. This may suggest a relatively narrow host range of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E in bats compared with lineage C betacoronaviruses including MERS-CoV.",

Moreover, cells that supported MERS-CoV replication showed significantly higher DPP4 mRNA expression than those that were non-susceptible to MERS-CoV, suggesting that cellular DPP4 expression is critical for viral infection. Since Ty-BatCoV HKU4 from T. pachypus was previously shown to be able to utilize hDPP4 for cell entry 41,42 , we expected MERS-CoV to be able to utilize Tp-DPP4 for receptor binding and infect T. pachypus cells. While the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in T. pachypus cells may be partly explained by the lack of DPP4 expression, overexpression of Tp-DPP4 was unable to confer viral susceptibility. Since mRNA expression may not always correlate with cell surface expression of the receptor, further studies are required to study the receptorbinding interphase between MERS-CoV and Tp-DPP4 and whether other cellular factors may play a role in determining viral replicative abilities in T. pachypus cells, which may offer further insights into the evolutionary origin and mechanisms of interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, one of the critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein, R336, was only conserved in T. pachypus and H. pomona DPP4 (cells from these two species did not support MERS-CoV replication), but not in the other four sequenced bat DPP4 (cells from these four species supported MERS-CoV replication). This suggests that this residue may not be critical for receptor binding. Binding and mutagenesis studies may help better understand the role of receptor-binding-interphase during viral evolution and interspecies jumping.",
