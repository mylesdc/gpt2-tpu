While the primary host reservoir responsible for harboring the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV has yet to be identified, evidence of direct transmission of the virus between civets in close proximity to humans has been observed and reported in at least two distinct events [7] [8] [9] .",

The objective of the BRC program is to provide a one-stop-shop for data and analytical tools to support data mining and analysis workflows for both basic and applied research. The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) BRC (www.viprbrc.org) supports virology researchers studying select agents and other significant public health pathogens belonging to 14 virus families, including Coronaviridae [16] .

First, ViPR captures different types of data from both external and internal sources and makes them accessible through custom search pages. ViPR stores these data for virus families categorized as containing either human priority pathogens or possible public health threats including 6 families of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses-Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, 5 families of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses-Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, 1 family of double-stranded RNA viruses-Reoviridae, and 2 families of double-stranded DNA viruses-Herpesviridae, Poxviridae. Although ViPR is focused on supporting human infectious disease research, related viruses within these families isolated from other host species are also accessible to allow comparative genomics research. Second, ViPR has assembled a suite of data analysis and visualization tools so that users can perform custom correlative analyses. Third, datasets and analysis results can be saved in private workspaces in the ViPR Workbench for subsequent retrieval and sharing.",

Sequence Feature (SF) definitions are obtained from the scientific literature, GenBank, UniProt and IEDB records, and are categorized as structural (e.g. alpha-helices), functional (e.g. active sites), immune epitopes or sequence alteration SF types. SF definitions are currently available in ViPR for Dengue (serotypes 1-4), Hepatitis C (subtype 1a) and Pox (Vaccinia) viruses; however, functionality exists that allows researchers to add new definitions for any other virus species in ViPR through community annotation efforts. Such crowd-sourcing efforts are essential to provide the custom sequence feature definitions for each taxon, which can then be useful in performing data mining, comparative genomics and/or evolutionary analyses by the community as a whole. In order to maintain highly accurate definitions within ViPR, all community-proposed SFs are inspected and validated by domain experts prior to becoming publicly accessible through ViPR.",

Constructing a custom query for any data type, including sequence records, is both fast and easy using the custom interfaces designed to reflect the contents in the ViPR system. Whole and partial genome sequence records can be searched with user-specified criteria including genera, species, virus host, and geographical and/or temporal point of isolation.

Keyword searches can be used to retrieve database entries based on any available metadata. More advanced pattern-matching search capabilities also exist to retrieve sequence records that contain specified sequence strings. Search results are reported in tabular format on a Genome Search Results page, which provides hyperlinks to Strain Details pages for each respective strain. The Strain Details page ( Figure 2 ) is specific to each virus strain and contains various annotations, including strain name and taxonomy, as well as a description of the host and geo-temporal point of specimen isolation. Genome-level information such as GenBank record name and accession number, sequence length and number of proteins encoded by the genome are also displayed on the Strain Details page together with Genome Image Map graphics and Protein Information tables.

When saving search criteria in the Workbench, the system can automatically notify the user via email whenever new records that match the original query are added to the database. Selected sequence records from multiple searches can be merged using Boolean logic, and can be combined with user uploaded data to be analyzed with the integrated suite of tools in ViPR, while keeping the uploaded data private.

A high-resolution image of the customized phylogenetic tree display can be exported in a variety of formats to enable more in-depth interpretation and/or inclusion in presentations or publications. For the current scientific use case, RAxML was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for all sequence records that matched the original search and filtering criteria, which was subsequently colored based on the host of isolation (Figure 4b) . The tree topology for this phylogenetic reconstruction shows two major clades that separate largely according to both the year and host of isolation. The majority of strains from the first clade were taken in 2003 with all but two members of this clade being isolated from civets (hereafter referred to as the 'civet-predominate clade'). For the second clade, almost all of the strains were sampled in 2004 with all but two members isolated from humans (hereafter referred to as the 'human-predominate clade'). This topology confirms that at least two species-jump events between civet and human have occurred [9] .

Specifically, our phylogenetic tree corroborates the theory that there were at least two separate human outbreaks from viruses closely related to two separate clades isolated from civets during the time of the SARS-CoV epidemic. Our tree also shows a strong correlation between host and year of isolation, although this observation is not true for all strains included in the tree. The meta-CATS analysis identified significant p-values for 117 nucleotide residues that were identified as having significant variation between the civet and human isolates. The positions that are located within the SARS-CoV Spike protein receptor-binding motif, which were identified by meta-CATS, appear to reflect virus sequence variations that affect binding to host-specific receptor proteins. Additional wetlab experimentation will be required to elucidate the specific function of the remaining significant sequence variations and whether they alter the fitness of the virus. Mapping residues and regions of interest onto a 3D protein structure can yield additional insight into their functional role.

The results that were obtained from the various analytical and visualization tools provided in ViPR and explored in the scientific use case are shown.

(b) A Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree color-coded by host of isolation. Horizontal branch lengths are proportional to distance (the proportion of nucleotide changes). The distance scale for the proportion of changes is provided at the bottom of the panel. Strains belonging to the \"civet-predominate\" (CP) or \"human-predominate\" (HP) clades are delineated with blue braces. (c) An abridged table of the meta-CATS output containing significant positions, raw chi-square values, C-values (roughly equivalent to p-values), chi-square degrees of freedom and residue diversity for a subset of significant positions identified across the genome. (d) A 3D homodimeric protein structure of the SARS-CoV Spike protein showing secondary structure in cartoon and positions 479 and 487 (highlighted in blue on one of the monomeric chains), which were identified as significantly differing between hosts at the nucleotide level by meta-CATS.",
