Stratification analysis of ethnicity and severity revealed a significant increase in influenza susceptibility by IFITM3-SNP rs12252among both Asian and Caucasian population.

Besides, our result also associated rs12252 with influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.32-4.25, P=0.004), (severe vs. control: OR=2.70, 95%",

The risk factors of influenza included the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus, acquired host factors (such as immunity and comorbidity) and intrinsic host susceptibility. The viral genetic determinants and host immunity have been widely studied, while the host genetic determinants remain elusive [1] . The study of host genetic factors involved in susceptibility to influenza is a promising strategy that may identify potential therapeutic targets [2] . As a result, systematical investigation of the association between host genetic factors and the occurrence of influenza is of pivotal importance. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified studies of the role of host genetic factors on susceptibility to severe influenza as a priority [3] .",

Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-1 (IFITM1), interferon-induced transmembrane protein-2 (IFITM2), and IFITM3 comprise a family of restriction factors that possess broad antiviral activities [6, 7, 8, 9] . IFITM3 is considered to be most active against IAV and resides in late endosomes and lysosomes using several orthologous genetic approaches [6, 8, 10, 11] . Although there is a lack of direct evidence for full understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying IFITM protein and virus infection interaction, Everitt et al. has shown that severity of influenza virus infection was greatly increased in IFITM3 knockout mice compared with wild-type animals. In humans, the rare SNP rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 results in a truncated protein, leading to reduced restriction of virus replication in vitro. The IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C was strongly associated with worse clinical outcomes for patients infected with the 2009 pandemic IAV [12] . Wang et al. found that patients with the rs12252-C/C IFN-IFITM3 genotype had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to survive [13] .",

However, these studies were seriously limited by their innate shortcomings. First, the majority of those studies were carried out on animal models instead of based on human clinical data and thus lack a translational stage in between. Secondly, these studies were seldom concerned with the association between SNP rs12252 and susceptibility to mild or severe influenza. Finally, the sample sizes of these studies were relatively small, and the findings were inconsistent [12, 13, 14, 15] .",

About 4 datasets involved in 445 cases and 4180 controls were included in the meta-analysis to explore the association of rs12252 and influenza risk. There was no obvious heterogeneity between the individual studies using five genetic models (P>0.05). In overall analysis, a significant increase in influenza susceptibility was found in the recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: Table 3 . The association between rs12252 and influenza susceptibility stratified by severity in the recessive model and the homozygote comparison respectively are shown in Figs 4 and 5. Overall, our results suggest that patients with the rs12252-C/C genotype of IFITM3 are more likely to have a significant increase in influenza susceptibility in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese. In the subgroup analysis stratified by severity, the results suggest a significant association between a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) with severe influenza susceptibility, but not in mild influenza subjects. Meta-analysis of the SNP rs12252 variant and influenza severity. Considering the two different types of influenza (Mild and Severe), we then assessed the association of rs12252 and two different types of influenza risk using an allele genetic model. About 2 datasets consisting of 83 mild/moderate influenza patients and 55 severe influenza patients were included in the meta-analysis to explore the association of rs12252 and influenza severity risk. There was no obvious heterogeneity between the individual studies using five genetic models (P>0.05). As shown in Table 4 , we analyzed the C allele (relative to the T allele) and influenza severity risk for 2 studies. Overall, comparison of C and T alleles generated a 23.7% increased risk for influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.32-4.25, P = 0.004), (severe vs. control: OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.85-3.94, P<0.001) and (mild vs. control: OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.93-1.71, P = 0.13). Similar trends persisted for both CC and TT genotype associations. Overall, our data clearly suggest that the rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection and also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza. ",

The H7N9 virus has caused 134 confirmed cases in nine provinces, and mortality up to 30% [27, 28] . The influenza pandemic is a serious health problem and is very difficult to cure. Recent in vitro studies show that the IFITM protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses, including influenza viruses [7, 10, 29, 30, 31] . However, Everitt et al. showed that first, IFITM3 knockout mice were found to develop fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with an otherwise-low-pathogenicity H3N2 influenza A virus. Second, hospitalized patients who were severely ill from seasonal flu or 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu exhibited an enrichment of a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that lacks the region corresponding to the first amino-terminal 21 amino acids due to the alteration of a splice acceptor site [12] . So we conducted this meta-analysis to confirm the association between the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity. Although only four studies were included in this meta-analysis, it will provide the basis for further study of molecular epidemiology, while providing useful predictive measures of outcome that should be of help in managing severe influenza.",

Our meta-analysis included 445 patients with influenza and 4180 controls from 4 studies. We investigated the association between the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 in general and also within different ethnic and severity subgroups. In addition, we studied rs12252 and influenza severity in 83 mild/moderate and 55 severe influenza cases. Our data showed that patients with the rs12252-C/C genotype of IFITM3 are more likely to increase the susceptibility to severe influenza but not in mild influenza, in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese. We also found that the rs12252-C allele showed a 23.7% increased chance of infection along with a risk for severe influenza. Similar trends persisted for both CC and TT genotype associations. Considering the wider confidence intervals and small sample sizes of population-based studies, more studies are required to quantify the size of this effect reliably. Future studies will also ask whether the disease course differs between severely infected patients who have the CC genotype and those with the CT or TT genotypes. This largely depends on the frequency of the risk genotype in the population, so this should be explored in future epidemiological studies.",

First, we only included published English articles available from four databases. Relevant articles published in other languages, in other databases and unpublished studies may have been missed, which might bias the results. Secondly, only four studies (two for UK and two for Chinese) were included in this meta-analysis. Thus, data on Asian and Caucasian subjects are inadequate. Considering this fact, the results from these two ethnicities should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, additional research in these two ethnicities and in other ethnicities is needed to generalize the findings. Thirdly, some studies had small sample sizes, which may affect the statistical power of the publication bias. Although publication bias in the meta-analysis by Egger's test was not significant, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate, so the results of these tests must be interpreted with caution in small-sample metaanalyses. Finally, considering the complex genetic network within, the potential role of the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 might be diluted or masked by other gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Therefore, the jury must remain out before the eventual truth prevails.",
