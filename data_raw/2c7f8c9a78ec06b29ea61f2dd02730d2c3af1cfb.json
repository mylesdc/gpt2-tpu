Integrins are important for setting the parameters of this resting state, particularly the epithelial-restricted \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin, which is upregulated during injury. Once expressed, \u03b1V\u03b26 moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through as yet undefined molecular mechanisms. We show that the upregulation of \u03b26 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. \u03b26-deficient mice (\u03b26 KO) have increased survival during influenza infection likely due to the limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although the \u03b26 KO have morphologically normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated lung CD11b + alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I IFN signaling activity, which we traced to the loss of \u03b26-activated transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Administration of exogenous TGF-\u03b2 to \u03b26 KO mice leads to reduced numbers of CD11b + AMs, decreased type I IFN signaling activity and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Our studies demonstrate that the loss of one epithelial protein, \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infection leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival.

Many inhaled microbes cause lethal infections if not contained by the lung immune system, which has evolved to balance rapid and efficient microbial clearance with protection of the delicate lung structure from excessive damage. Lung damage caused by microbial pathogens is the cause of acute lung injury (ALI), which leads to increased edema, alveolar permeability, and impaired oxygen exchange. In severe cases, ALI can result in impaired gas exchange function and ultimately death (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) [1] . To mitigate lung damage after infection, inflammation resolves, returning to homeostasis that restores normal lung function [2, 3] . The air-interface structure of the lung involves a complex immune cell population including resident interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells, and GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophages [4] [5] [6] [7] . A key question in understanding pulmonary immunity concerns how the balance between effective immune surveillance and maintenance of lung anatomy and physiology is achieved through life.",

Similarly, elderly patients suffering from RSV sustained widespread alveolar damage [22] . Bacterial pneumonia can result in increased formation of hyaline membranes [23] . Deposition of collagen and fibrin, while necessary for lung repair, can also build up and block gas exchange [24] . In the case of influenza, the major complication leading to ALI/ARDS is pulmonary edema and impaired fluid clearance due to dysregulation of transporters that clear fluid from the alveolus such as ENaC and Na + K + ATPase [23, 25, 26] .

Mechanistically, we found that epithelial \u03b26 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. In the absence of \u03b26, type I interferon signaling is constitutive, causing the host to have an advantage over the spread of the virus. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-\u03b21 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that \u03b1V\u03b26 controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent mechanism.

To test this, we measured \u03b26 expression by quantitative RT-PCR at different times post-influenza infection. Consistent with lung injury models, \u03b26 mRNA was significantly upregulated in whole lung homogenates by 3 days post-infection (dpi) and expression remained elevated through 5 dpi (p < 0.0001) correlating with the appearance of ALI (Fig 1A) .

Compared to WT controls, \u03b26 KO mice lost significantly less weight (4, 6, and 8 dpi p < 0.0001) and began to recover by 10 dpi, while WT mice lost weight and either succumbed to infection or were euthanized due to morbidity between 6-10 dpi (Fig 1B and  1C ).

In marked contrast, evidence of inflammation and tissue damage in the \u03b26 KO lungs was generally limited to terminal bronchioles and small numbers of adjacent alveoli (Fig 2A) . Infected WT mice had increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 throughout the duration of infection, while the inflammatory cytokine response in \u03b26 KO mice was less robust ( Fig  2B) . Evidence of alterations to the alveolar capillary barrier was found in infected WT mice beginning at 5 dpi as compared to KO mice (Fig 2C-2F ) including heavier lungs as determined by wet/dry weight ratios (5 dpi p = 0.0077, 7 dpi p = 0.0063) indicating increased edema ( Fig  2C) , accompanied by increased total protein (p < 0.0001, Fig 2D) and albumin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (7 dpi p < 0.0001, Fig 2E) and accumulation of Evans blue dye in the lungs of WT mice (p = 0.0071, Fig 2F) .

            "text": "The most likely mechanism of protection in influenza infected \u03b26 KO mice was decreased viral titers. However, tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) and quantitative real-time PCR showed no significant differences in viral titers, although RT-PCR suggested a trend towards lower titers in \u03b26 KO mice (Fig 3A and 3B ). We therefore spatially monitored viral spread in the lungs by immunohistochemistry for viral nucleoprotein (NP) and use of a reporter virus [34, 35] . Viral spread into the alveolar spaces was reduced in \u03b26 KO mice in comparison to WT mice, which had extensive NP staining of type II pneumocytes and macrophages in the alveolar spaces by 5 dpi. In contrast, NP staining in \u03b26 KO mice was largely restricted to the terminal bronchiolar epithelium and adjacent alveoli (Fig 3C) . This is even more evident using our NLuc CA/09 reporter virus, which clearly demonstrates decreased virus in \u03b26 KO ( [34, 35] , S1 Fig) . Finally, WT lungs had a higher percentage of sites of active infection at 5 and 7 dpi as well as more viral antigen detected in the alveolar spaces (Fig 3D and 3E) . Collectively, viral spread in KO lungs was limited compared to WT mice, with less extensive involvement of alveolar epithelial cells possibly explaining the improved lung function relative to controls. These findings are consistent with studies suggesting that increased survival during influenza infection can be independent of changes in viral titers [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .",

Loss of the \u03b26 integrin leads to a modified lung microenvironment To understand the underlying mechanism(s) for the decreased viral spread within the lungs of \u03b26 KO mice, we performed flow cytometry on BALF and lungs at different times post-infection. No significant differences were noted in numbers of TNF-\u03b1/iNOS-producing (tip)DCs, neutrophils, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, or influenza PB1-specific CD8 + T cells in either BALF (Fig 4A-4E ) or whole lung (Fig 4F-4J ). However, we noted substantial differences in the resident lung F480 + CD11c + CD11b + populations (macrophages and dendritic cells), namely that \u03b26 KO mice lacked a conventional CD11c + alveolar macrophage (AM) population ( Fig 5A) . AMs have characteristic flow cytometry properties as compared to dendritic cells (DCs) or incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes including autofluoresence in the FITC channel, high constitutive expression of CD11c, F4/80 and SiglecF and low expression of CD11b [4, 41, 42] . By contrast, incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes express CD11b, providing a means to distinguish between resident AM, inflammatory bone marrow-derived monocytes and DCs [4, 43] . When we examined the lung macrophage/DC populations in uninfected \u03b26 KO mice we found they had higher numbers of autofluorescent cells indicating AMs ( Fig 5B) but instead of the normal CD11c hi CD11bphenotype, the vast majority of the \u03b26 KO AM were MerTK + , CD64 + , CD11c + , and uniformly CD11b + (Fig 5C; See S2 and S3 Figs for gating strategies). These cells maintained expression of F4/80 and SiglecF, suggesting they are AMs with altered properties. They were also phenotypically distinct from those of WT mice, with a 'foamy' appearance typical of activated macrophages ( Fig 5D) . Importantly, the \u03b26 KO CD11c + CD11b + AM were present at the earliest times tested (d3 after birth), continued to be present at all points of adulthood (S4A Fig) , and were not affected by reducing neonatal exposure to airborne particulate matter by using HEPA-filtered cages or low dust cage bedding (S4B Fig). Even throughout the course of influenza infection very few CD11c hi CD11bcells were present in the lungs of \u03b26 KO mice ( Fig  5E) . As the lungs from \u03b26 KO were overtly normal, we concluded the CD11c + CD11b + cells were sufficient to perform the normal activities of lung homeostasis [12, 14, 16, 30] .",

To test whether the \u03b26 KO CD11c + CD11b + AM were predominantly derived from embryonic progenitors, we created mice where the blood monocyte pool was severely depleted by loss of the chemokine receptor CCR2, which is the predominant mediator for monocyte egress from the bone marrow. In the lungs of \u03b26/CCR2 doubly-deficient mice, CD11c + CD11b + AM were present in identical amounts compared with those of \u03b26 KO mice, arguing these cells are unlikely to be derived from peripheral blood monocytes (S4C Fig). Although other unknown pathways to recruit monocytes to the lung cannot be discounted, they are not as well characterized or understood as the CCR2 pathway. Taken together, we concluded loss of an epithelial integrin alters the phenotype of lung AMs.",

Thus, we next asked if the altered macrophage phenotype in the \u03b26 KO mice was TGF-\u03b21 dependent. As expected, endogenous lung TGF-\u03b21 activity was reduced in \u03b26 KO mice as compared to WT (Fig 7A) . To test the hypothesis that reduced TGF-\u03b21 activity contributed to the altered lung microenvironment of \u03b26 KO mice, we intranasally administered exogenous TGF-\u03b21 to WT and \u03b26 KO mice every other day for 3 weeks ( Fig  7B) as described [46] . \u03b26 KO mice treated with TGF-\u03b21 had increased numbers of CD11c +-CD11bmacrophages ( Fig 7C, quantification Fig 7D) , partially reversing the CD11c + CD11b + phenotype, and were no longer protected from influenza infection ( Fig 7E) suggesting that the loss of \u03b26-mediated TGF-\u03b21activation is important for both protection and the 'activated' macrophage phenotype.",

Type I IFNs are amongst the most potent cytokines limiting viral spread. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that \u03b26 KO mice had increased type I IFN than WT. We used phosphorylated STAT1 levels (pSTAT1) as a marker for type I IFN signaling. Increased pSTAT1 along with increased type I IFN gene expression and unchanged expression of type II IFN-dependent targets such as IDO1 are indicative of a type I IFN dominated environment. Further, STAT1 is a robust marker of type I IFN signaling due to its weak activation by other cytokines such as IL-6 [47] . Immunoblot analysis of whole lung homogenates showed the \u03b26 KO mice had robust type I IFN signaling at baseline that increased 3-5 dpi (Fig 8A) . We sought to determine the source of type I IFNs and how epithelial-expressed \u03b26 regulated the IFN response. We noted that type I IFN mRNAs were not substantially altered in uninfected \u03b26 KO mice (S6A-S6D Figs). Furthermore, ELISA measurements for type I IFNs did not show substantial differences between WT and \u03b26 KO mice within whole lung homogenates. Therefore, we generated \u03b26 KO mice crossed to an IFN-\u03b2-YFP reporter strain. In these mice, YFP expression in the whole lung was predominantly found in CD45 + cells and increased in the absence of \u03b26 ( Fig 8B) ; although experiments with n = 3-6 mice per group run in triplicate. Error bars indicate SEM. Not statistically significant by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. (B) RNA was extracted from the lungs of infected mice and viral replication was determined by real time PCR assay targeting the influenza M gene. Data are representative of 6 independent experiments with n = 3-4 mice per group run in triplicate. Error bars indicate SEM. Not statistically significant by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. (C) Whole lung sections were paraffin-embedded and stained for influenza NP antigen at 2, 5, and 7 dpi. Bar immunofluorescent microscopy of frozen lung sections from WT and \u03b26 KO YFP reporter mice showed increased YFP + cells scattered throughout the lung; including in the epithelia ( Fig  8C and 8D ). Further delineation of the exact cell types in this system expressing YFP is precluded by the strong autofluorescence in the FITC channel in lung macrophages [4] . Thus, we examined isolated AMs and primary epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface from \u03b26 KO and WT mice for increased type I IFN signaling.",

Two caveats to the model proposed in Fig 10 include (i) the fact that \u03b26 may regulate factors other than TGF-\u03b21 that cause the downstream effects, and (ii) that we cannot yet definitively distinguish whether \u03b26 negatively regulates type I IFN signaling, type I IFN production or both pathways. In our hands, assays quantitating type I IFN amounts by ELISA or bead-based assays are variable, lacking sensitivity or reproducibility. Furthermore, the potential increase in type I receptor expression on \u03b26 KO macrophages (Table 1 ) could cause increased uptake of type I IFNs and not accurately reflect the soluble amounts present in the lung at a given time in homeostasis. Thus, the identification of the point at which \u03b26 (with or without TGF-\u03b21) negatively regulates IFN signaling will require new tools and approaches investigating regulation in both macrophages and epithelial cells.",

It is possible that HPAI H5N1 viruses are more resistant to type I IFN, that mice succumb due to direct viral cytopathic effect, or complications of systemic infection. Further studies are needed to understand why \u03b26 KO mice are not protected against HPAI H5N1 infection. Taken together, these data suggest \u03b26-mediated modulation of IFN responses affects responses to multiple respiratory pathogens whereas protective responses depend on IFN signaling. The airway epithelium is a complex barrier comprised of multiple cell types that acts as an interface between the external environment and the internal lung milieu. It serves three main functions in a healthy lung; providing a tight mechanical barrier that rapidly repairs upon insult, mediating innate immune activity to limit foreign antigen invasion, and initiating an inflammatory response through production of cytokines and chemokines [51] . A variety of experimental models and human studies demonstrate the host response to respiratory infection involves initiation, resolution, and restoration phases, all of which must be tightly regulated to prevent disease [52] . However, little is known about how interactions between epithelial cells, which are often the primary targets of respiratory pathogens, and alveolar macrophages, which play a critical role in controlling infections, and the regulation of these responses. Our data identify a pathway by which alveolar epithelial cells normally suppress the anti-microbial activity of alveolar macrophages through a pathway that may involve local activation of TGF-\u03b2 and subsequent suppression of IFN signaling. In terms of homeostasis, little is known about how type I IFNs control the status of tissue microenvironments. Most work on type I IFN signaling has been associated with anti-viral responses and the regulation of inflammation over the first 18-24 months of life [16] . The implication of our findings is that the lung can tolerate a homeostatic increase in IFN signaling, which provides an advantage against viral spread, but likely comes with 'costs' that are not yet clear. We note a recent study has shown homeostatic IFN-\u03b2 and IFNAR signaling in the brain has an essential role in suppressing neurodegeneration [53] . Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the hitherto unknown tissue-specific homeostatic roles of type I IFN signaling is warranted. During infection, although it would seem that upregulation of \u03b26 would only have a negative impact on the host by limiting the anti-viral response, it could also be important for balancing the inflammatory response by suppressing activated macrophages through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent process [2, 5, 15, 45] , initiating wound repair, or by recruiting macrophages to the site of infection. Attempts to address the role of TGF-\u03b2 in influenza pathogenesis by systemic inhibition resulted in lethal infection [54] . Thus, future studies will focus on inhibiting the \u03b26 integrin at different times post-infection to understand its precise role in viral infection and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

The \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin is expressed at low amounts in healthy adult tissue but is rapidly upregulated during development and in response to injury and inflammation [30] . Once expressed, \u03b26 activates latent TGF-\u03b21 by binding to the RGD motif in the latency-associated peptide (LAP) [10, 55] . Upon activation, TGF-\u03b21 regulates a variety of genes associated with the immune response and pulmonary fibrosis and is thought to negatively restrict inflammation in macrophages through an unknown mechanism [45] . However, systemic inhibition of all TGF-\u03b2 isoforms by a broadly neutralizing antibody led to lethal influenza infection [54] suggesting that the role of TGF-\u03b2 during infection may be complex and depend on both the cellular milieu and TGF-\u03b2 isoform. Recent work has shown that the pulmonary microenvironment dictates the behavior of alveolar macrophages to a greater extent than the origin of the macrophages [42] . Based on our studies we propose that in the lung microenvironment, upregulation of the \u03b26 integrin leads to localized activation of TGF-\u03b21 that negatively regulates alveolar macrophages leading to decreased type I IFN activity in the microenvironment through an as yet undefined mechanism that will require further molecular investigation. An important extension of this model is that influenza viruses themselves activate latent TGF-\u03b2 during infection [56] and global inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 during infection is lethal, suggesting an important role in protection from influenza [54] . Therefore, it will be important to be able to experimentally segregate the host-versus virus-specific TGF-\u03b2 processing events in mice expressing or lacking \u03b26 integrin.",

            "text": "Overall, loss of the \u03b26 integrin resulted in protection from a variety of respiratory infections including influenza and Sendai viruses, bacterial pneumonia, and viral-bacterial co-infections. \u03b26 KO mice had significantly reduced extent and severity of lung injury and inflammation, reduced collagen deposition despite no difference in viral titer, consistent with studies using \u03b26 integrin function blocking antibodies [57] , with virus infection being more restricted to airways instead of infiltrating the deep-lung alveolar spaces. \u03b26 function blocking antibodies have been successfully used to improve outcome in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and currently recruiting for phase II human clinical trials [58, 59] . While the \u03b26 integrin represents an attractive therapeutic target to combat pulmonary disease, it does play a role in lung homeostasis. While transient inhibition of \u03b26 in the lung results in resistance to infection, complete lack of \u03b26 function for long periods of time could be detrimental. Over long periods of time, \u03b26 KO mice over produce macrophage-derived matrix metalloprotease MMP12, leading to emphysema and destruction of pulmonary tissue [16] . However, for short-term protection against the adverse consequences of potentially lethal pulmonary viral infections, our work identifies the \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin as a potentially attractive therapeutic target for transient intervention in lung viral infection. Mice C57BL/6, Ifnb1-YFP, CCR2 KO and CD45.1 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Itgb6 -/mice, generated as described [9] and backcrossed 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background, were obtained from Dean Sheppard (UCSF) then bred at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Littermate controls from heterozygous crosses were used as controls. IFNAR KO mice were obtained from Dr. Laura Knoll (University of Wisconsin). Knockouts were confirmed by PCR using primer sets (CCR2, IFNAR) reported on the Jackson Laboratories website, or as previously described (\u03b26) [16] .",
