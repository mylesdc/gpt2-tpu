            "text": "Enteric caliciviruses in the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus are important pathogens that cause severe acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) and their final product, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), are known to play important roles in the modulation of both the host response to infection and the replicative cycles of several viruses. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which the COX/PGE 2 pathway regulates sapovirus replication remains largely unknown. In this study, infection with porcine sapovirus (PSaV) strain Cowden, the only cultivable virus within the genus Sapovirus, markedly increased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels at 24 and 36 h postinfection (hpi), with only a transient increase in COX-1 levels seen at 24 hpi. The treatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-1 and COX-2, significantly reduced PGE 2 production, as well as PSaV replication. Expression of the viral proteins VPg and ProPol was associated with activation of the COX/PGE 2 pathway. We observed that pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 dramatically increased NO production, causing a reduction in PSaV replication that could be restored by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase via the inhibitor N-nitro-L-methylarginine ester. This study identified a pivotal role for the COX/PGE 2 pathway in the regulation of NO production during the sapovirus life cycle, providing new insights into the life cycle of this poorly characterized family of viruses. Our findings also reveal potential new targets for treatment of sapovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses are among the major etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals, but little is known about sapovirus host factor requirements. Here, using only cultivable porcine sapovirus (PSaV) strain Cowden, we demonstrate that PSaV induced the vitalization of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) pathway. Targeting of COX-1/2 using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin and the COX-2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and celecoxib or siRNAs targeting COXs, inhibited PSaV replication. Expression of the viral proteins VPg and ProPol was associated with activation of the COX/PGE 2 pathway. We further demonstrate that the production of PGE 2 provides a protective effect against the antiviral effector mechanism of nitric oxide. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which PSaV manipulates the host cell to provide an environment suitable for efficient viral growth, which in turn can be a new target for treatment of sapovirus infection.",

Inhibition of COX-2 activity was found to lead to a concomitant increase in NO production during PSaV replication, which could be reversed in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. 8B ). The reversal of the effect of COX-2 inhibition by L-NAME also resulted in the subsequent restoration of PSaV infectivity levels, as well as PSaV RNA and protein levels ( Fig. 8C to E). Collectively, these data suggest that the proviral effects of PGE 2 produced by both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a result of PSaV infection are mediated by the inhibition of the antiviral effect of NO.",

As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses must therefore subvert and/or avoid the host response to infection in order to complete their life cycle. As a result, pathogens, including viruses, have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms that enable the control of cellular pathways, evade the host immune response, and hijack signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the potential role of the COX/PGE 2 pathway in the PSaV life cycle and the control of infection. We found that the COX/PGE 2 pathway was activated during the PSaV life cycle and that this activation had proviral effects via the inhibition of NO production. Furthermore, we determined that expression of the VPg and ProPol proteins of PSaV was sufficient to induce COX expression and PGE 2 production.",

NO secretion can be triggered in vitro and in vivo by rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) (28) (29) (30) , which in turn may cause diarrhea by elevating intestinal permeability (31, 32) and regulating intestinal motility (33) and intestinal ion transport (34, 35) . In contrast to rotavirus infection (28) (29) (30) , little NO production was observed during PSaV replication in LLC-PK cells, possibly due to the synthesis of PGE 2 , suggesting that NO may not be involved in sapovirus-induced diarrhea. However, it is important to note that we cannot fully rule out a potential role for NO in PSaV pathogenesis in vivo, where the cellular response to infection is influenced by numerous cell types and may not be entirely reproduced in immortalized cells in vitro. In a few instances, viral proteins have been shown to stimulate activation of the COX/PGE 2 pathway, often by acting either directly or indirectly as a transcriptional transactivator of COX-2 gene expression (36) (37) (38) (39) . Among the viral proteins for which this activity has been reported, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS3, a viral serine protease, is known to enhance the COX-2/PGE 2 pathway by activating multiple signaling pathways (40) . In addition, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein also activates the expression of the COX-2/PGE 2 pathway by binding directly to regulatory elements for NF-B and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (39) . In the present study, we demonstrated that expression of the PSaV VPg or ProPol protein in isolation was sufficient to lead to activation of the COX-2/PGE 2 pathway. The mechanism behind this activation remains to be determined and is the subject of future study.",

However, other COX-2specific inhibitors had weaker inhibitory effects on PSaV replication, most likely due to their less potent activity and the fact that higher concentrations required for effective COX inhibition resulted in cell toxicity observed during their use. In addition, more robust inhibitory effects of the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 and the COX-1/2 nonselective inhibitor indomethacin on PSaV replication was observed in posttreatment than in pre/posttreatment. The reason why posttreatment with these inhibitors has a stronger effect than pre/posttreatment remains unknown.
