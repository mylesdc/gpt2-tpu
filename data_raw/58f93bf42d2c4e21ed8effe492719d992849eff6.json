Immunized mammals are a wide source of hyperimmune sera used in different approaches, including diagnosis and the study of hostparasite interactions. Unfortunately, mammalian antibodies present limitations for its production, such as the necessity for animal bleeding, low yield, interference with rheumatoid factor, complement activation and affinity to Fc mammalian receptors. IgY antibodies avoid those limitations; therefore they could be an alternative to be applied in T. gondii model.",

IgY anti-STAg antibodies presented high avidity and were able to recognize a broad range of parasite antigens, although some marked differences were observed in reactivity profile between antibodies produced in immunized hens and mice. Interestingly, IgY antibodies against Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp. did not react to STAg. We also show that IgY antibodies were suitable to detect T. gondii forms in paraffin-embedded sections and culture cell monolayers.",

The parasite has distinct developmental stages, such as the fast-replicating tachyzoites that are present in the acute phase of infection, while the slow-replicating bradyzoites form tissue cysts in muscular and nervous tissues during the chronic phase of infection [1] [2] . Infection usually takes place after accidental ingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts, oocyst-contaminated food or water, and by transplacental passage of tachyzoites in active infection during the gestational period [3] [4] . Congenital infection may lead to neurological disorders, ocular disease and/or fetal death [5] . T. gondii is also a major cause of infectious abortion and induces clinical disease in production animals, especially goat, sheep and swine, elevating production costs and resulting in considerable impact on the livestock industry as well as the public health [6] .",

Although enriched in IgY antibodies, the water soluble fraction (S1) still presented undesirable low molecular weight proteins after acid water precipitation of pooled egg yolk (Fig. 1B , lane S1) that were eliminated after salting-out step (Fig. 1B, lane P2) , presenting an average protein concentration of 4 mg/mL. We recovered 115 eggs from four STAg-immunized chickens during a 49-day interval. Each egg presented an average of 12 mL of yolk and the mean yield was 48 mg of polyclonal antibody per egg. Precipitated antibodies contained in P2 fraction were further submitted to purification by exclusion-size chromatography (Fig. 1C ), resulting in a protein peak between the 13th and 19th fractions, although elevated purity was detected mainly in the 14th fraction (F14), as it may be observed in its SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 1D) . Thus, the used protocol was able to retrieve a mean of 4 mg of total IgY from 1 ml of crude egg yolk. Slot-blot assays confirmed IgY in fractions from salting-out and gel filtration purified fractions until the concentration of 110 ng of protein (Fig. 1E ).",

The antigen recognition repertoire and avidity maturation of IgY anti-STAg were also verified by immunoblot. Similar to ELISA, reactivity was first observed on day 21 after immunization, with strong staining of a 30 kDa protein (Fig. 2C) . From the 35 th day onwards, IgY anti-STAg antibodies recognized a broad range of T. gondii antigens.

These differences were maintained independently of the route used to immunize the mice (i.m. or s.c., Fig. 5A ). In order to further observe those differences in recognition, we performed 2D-immunoblots (WB2D) using the polyclonal antibodies obtained from immunized hens and mice. The differences in recognition were clearly noted in WB2D assay, with IgY antibodies recognizing a sequence of five antigenic spots at ,40 kDa, however with distinct isoelectric points -from neutral to basic pH (Fig. 5B ). On the other hand, mouse IgG reacted strongly to two acidic antigens at ,50 kDa ( Fig. 5C ), while IgY reacted faintly to the same spots and a basic protein with similar molecular weight (Fig. 5B ). Such differences were also noted in the distinct recognition patterns in antigens with 60-80 kDa, as well as the absence of immunodominant p22 antigen by chicken IgY. Additionally, STAg immobilized in nitrocellulose strips were probed to anti-Neospora caninum e anti-Eimeria spp. IgY in order to check the specificity of the antibodies.

These anti-STAg antibodies were obtained from the egg yolk, in a protocol which animal bleeding turned out to be unnecessary [19] . Generally, yolk IgY arise around 7 th to 10 th day after the sera antibodies, in a sera concentration-dependent manner [20] . In addition, the large amounts of polyclonal antibodies recovered from the egg yolk in this process, the high avidity of the produced IgY antibodies, and their potential applications are itself the great features of the protocol herein described. Egg yolks contain large amounts of IgY passively transferred by hens, with mass ranging between 2-8 mg per mL after purification, and it has been estimated that 2-10% of total egg yolk antibodies are antigen-specific [21, 9] . To obtain STAg-specific IgY we used simple protocols, which are easily reproduced without the need of refined equipment or reagents. Additionally, installations required for IgY production are smaller and easier to handle than those designed for small ruminants, commonly used for large scale antisera production [22] . The production of specific IgY has been previously described for the recognition of a broad range of targets, including Plasmodium falciparum [23] , hepatitis A virus [24] and tumor cells [25] [26] .",

We demonstrated that STAg-immunized hens produced large amounts of high avidity polyclonal IgY anti-STAg antibodies after the first booster, with early recognition of p30 proteins. It is known that SAG1 protein (p30) triggers the human IgG maturation in latter stages of T. gondii infection [28] . Additionally, IgY antibodies recognized a broad range of proteins, with distinct isoelectric points determined by 2D-immunoblot. Previous studies have shown that serum samples from naturally infected humans react to a broad spectrum of T. gondii proteins [29] and experimentally infected mice produce specific antibodies against high and low molecular weight antigens of tachyzoites [30] . Consistently, our results demonstrated that IgY anti-STAg presented an antigen recognition profile similar to mouse serum, although some antigens were more immunogenic for hens than mice, probably due to the phylogenetic distance among these animals. In addition, IgY antibodies raised against closely related parasites did not recognize STAg proteins, which denotes an interesting feature of the IgY system, since crossreactivity is a normal feature of mammalian IgG.",

We herein demonstrated for the first time distinct applications for specific IgY antibodies in the T. gondii model. As previously stated, this antibody producing system offers high yield of specific antibodies [32] . We believe that immunization of hens with selected T. gondii targets could improve the range of applications for IgY antibodies. For the P. falciparum model, it has been demonstrated that monospecific and polyclonal IgY antibodies were advantageous [10] . In that sense, immunizations using single antigens of T. gondii could be employed to better understand the role of the selected molecules, as tools to improve the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis [33] or the knowledge of hostparasite interaction mechanisms [34] . Additionally, the identification of conserved surface antigens among apicomplexan organisms is usually performed by mammal specific IgG antibodies and contributes to our understanding of parasite evolution [35] [36] [37] .",

The optimal conditions for ELISA were obtained through block titration of the reagents. Briefly, high affinity microtiter plates (Costar Corning Incorporated, USA) were coated with STAg (10 mg/mL) in 0.06 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4uC. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-Tween 0.05% (PBS-T) and blocked with PBS-T plus 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-T-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. P2 samples were adjusted to 2 mg/well in PBS-T-BSA, added to the wells in duplicate and incubated for 1 h at 37uC. After washing, plates were incubated with rabbit anti-IgY antibody labeled with peroxidase, diluted 1:30.000 in PBS-T, for 1 h at 37uC. The reaction was revealed by adding 0.01 M 2,29-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS, Sigma) and 0.03% H 2 O 2 , and optical density (OD) was determined at 405 nm. Two positive quality-controls and six negative controls (irrelevant IgY) were included in each plate in order to calculate the cut off, which was established as the mean OD values for irrelevant IgY plus three standard deviations. The same protocol was applied to mouse IgG anti-STAg obtained after immunization, using a goat IgG anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma), at 1:2000 dilution. Results were expressed as ELISA index (EI) as previously proposed [47] as follows: EI = OD sample /OD cut off , where values of EI .1.2 were considered positive.",
