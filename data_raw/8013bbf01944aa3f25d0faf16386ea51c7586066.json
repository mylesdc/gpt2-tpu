However, the downstream genes and mechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized.",

The construction of this library allowed the identification of 6,202 new bean ESTs, significantly adding to the available sequences for this plant. Regulation of selected bean genes in response to bean rust infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Plant gene expression was similar for both race 41 and 49 during the first 48 hours of the infection process but varied significantly at the later time points (72-96 hours after inoculation) mainly due to the presence of the Avr4 gene in the race 49 leading to a hypersensitive response in the bean plants. A biphasic pattern of gene expression was observed for several genes regulated in response to fungal infection.",

It is the target of multiple pests and diseases causing substantial losses. For example, on susceptible bean cultivars, bean rust, caused by Uromyces appendiculatus, may cause yield reduction from 18 to 100% with favorable environmental conditions, such as high moisture and temperature between 17 and 27\u00b0C [1] . Among the 5 different stages of the bean rust life cycle, basidia, pycnia, aecia, uredinia, and telia, the most devastating on bean is the uredinial stage. The latent period between the germination of an urediniospore and the formation of a sporulating pustule can be as short as 7 days. Signs of infection by Uromyces appendiculatus include the presence of uredinia or sporeproducing pustules on the surface of the leaf. The identification of fungal proteins from quiescent and germinating uredospores enhanced the understanding of the infection process of this fungus [2, 3] .",

The large number of resistance (R) genes for bean rust may correlate with the high pathogen population diversity; with 90 different races identified [4] . The locus Ur-3 confers resistance to 44 out of the 89 U. appendiculatus races present in the USA [5, 6] . Besides the Ur-3 locus, a number of other R genes were identified in bean; such as locus Ur-4 for race 49, locus Ur-11 epistatic to Ur-4 for race 67 or locus Ur-13 mapped to the linkage group B8 [7, 8] . To date, no large scale transcriptomic analysis of bean rust infection has been performed to better understand the mechanism of resistance. All of these Ur genes are effective against one specific rust strain, following the gene-for-gene resistance theory. Consequently, gene pyramiding was used to produce cultivars carrying multiple resistance genes [9] . Unfortunately, such resistance may prove to be effective in the field for only a short time due to the adaptation of the fungus to overcome plant defenses [10] . Consequently, unraveling and understanding the mechanisms downstream of these R genes is a key research goal to circumvent the adaptation of the fungus to plant resistance.",

The resistance to U. appendiculatus is conferred by the presence of the Ur-4 gene in this cultivar that leads to a hypersensitive response (HR) in presence of the pathogen race 49 [11] . This cDNA bean library was enriched in expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that are potentially up-regulated by the compatible and incompatible interactions. More than 20,000 clones from the SSH library were sequenced and assembled into contigs. A total of 10,221 P. vulgaris sequences and 360 U. appendiculatus sequences were added to the NCBI database, significantly increasing the number of ESTs available for common bean. The regulation of 90 genes was confirmed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealing 3 main expression patterns and highlighting gene regulation that occurs downstream of R protein activation.",

The tags identify the treatment and time points used in generating the original mRNA. The distribution of these tags among the library is presented in the Figure 1 . Approximately 17% of the sequences lacked a tag after sequencing, while 31% of the sequences had a \"race 49\" tag and more than 51% had a \"race 41\" tag. It is important to note that the majority of the ESTs coming from the fungus were tagged \"late41\", consistent with an effective colonization of the leaf by the virulent fungus (race 41). The lack of tag identification may come from inefficient incorporation of the tag during the library construction or the presence of non-identified nucleotide in the tag sequence making it indiscernible. The various cDNAs in the library could be resolved back to their source tissue by the presence of unique sequence tags. For example, 51% percent of the EST sequences were derived from bean tissue infected with race 41 since they had the \"race 41\" tag. This likely reflects the compatible interaction between the race 41 and its host allowing greater fungal penetration. Biotrophic fungi are known to reprogram the host plant cell to support their growth [15] and plant ESTs tagged with race 41 could be involved in this process.",

Our estimation is based on the comparison of cv Early Gallatin with 3 other cultivars (Bat93, Negro Jamapa 81, and G19883). When this comparison is made between only 2 different cultivars (Early Gallatin and G19883) the SNP frequency in the coding sequences decreases to 1 SNP every 570 bp. For comparison, the SNP frequency in the soybean coding sequence was estimated at 1 SNP/490 bp in exons and 1 SNP/375 bp in introns [18] .

During the first 24 hours of the infection, the six genes were expressed at comparable levels. However, by 48 HAI, the expression of all six genes was significantly higher in tissues infected with the virulent race 41 isolate. This result likely reflects the nature of the compatible, virulent interaction as compared to inhibition of race 49 infection by the host defenses. Consistent with this, all six genes used in this analysis came from the ESTs possessing the tag of the \"late41\" library. The EST CL3018Contig1, encoding for a plant-induced rust protein 1, exhibits significant similarity with NMT1 (no messenger in thiamine), which is involved in the biosynthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine (vitamin B1). This gene was strongly expressed only in tissue infected with the virulent fungus race 41. Similar observations were made previously using bean plants infected with Uromyces fabae [28] . These data also suggest that the haustoria may not only be the site of nutrient uptake from the plant [29] but also the site of metabolite biosynthesis with specific haustorial genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis [e.g., NMT1] [28] .",

Unisequences coming from the ESTs in the \"race 49\" tagged libraries were desirable due to their potential involvement in a resistance pathway. The regulation of these genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR using RNA from uninoculated leaf tissues or those inoculated with either U. appendiculatus uredospores of race 41 or race 49 isolates at the time points 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 HAI. The data obtained were used to compare the ratio of gene expression in tissues infected with race 41 or race 49 to that in uninoculated bean leaves. The data also allowed a direct comparison of gene expression induced by either race 41 or race 49. The first two comparisons highlight regulation in the infected plants by the rust fungi, while the third comparison highlights gene expression differences between the two types of infection, resistant and susceptible. The 90 genes showed significant expression differences in at least one of the 3 comparisons (p-value < 0.05, cut-off < -1 or > 1 or p-value < 0.1, cut-off < -0.58 or > 0.58 in log base 2).",

For example, 39 and 41 genes showed differential regulation within 6 and 12 HAI, respectively, in tissue inoculated with race 41. At these same time points 40 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially regulated in tissues infected with race 49. At the latest time points, 72 and 96 HAI, 16 and 19 genes, respectively, for race 41 and 6 and 14 genes, respectively, for race 49 were differentially regulated. It is interesting to note that the regulation occurring at the early time points appeared to be independent of the fungal race used for inoculation. At the early time points (i.e., first 48 hours), only 16 genes (36% of those tested) showed a difference in expression in tissues inoculated with the two fungal races. However, at the later time points, this number increased to 34 genes with 18 (36%) and 16 (32%) at 72 and 96 HAI, respectively. These results suggested that during the beginning of the infection most of the bean gene regulation is independent of the fungal race, but differences due to fungal race occur as the infection progresses. It is possible that fungal-Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) elicitors (e.g., chitin) induce the same response from the plant at the beginning of the infection. Subsequently, the Avr4 protein in the race 49 is recognized after a couple of days leading to the induction of defense-related genes. However, in bean infected by race 41, no plant defense is activated and gene expression may reflect the reprogramming of the plant host by the fungus especially at the haustorial site.",

In contrast, soybean plants infected with Phytophthora sojae, a hemibiotrophic oomycete, did not show a biphasic pattern of gene response [31] . Based on these examples, this biphasic pattern might be specific to the biotrophic rust fungi. Further comparisons need to be made to establish the specificity of this \"dip\" pattern of gene expression in response to biotrophic fungal infection.",

            "text": "A more detailed analysis was performed on the expression ratio of transcripts in bean leaves inoculated with the fungus race 41 or race 49 versus uninoculated bean leaves. These analyses are presented in a hierarchical cluster based on Euclidian distance ( Figure 6 , see additional file 3: excel file of the ratio of the expression level of the 90 regulated genes for all conditions). This cluster can be divided into five main groups. The first, group A (A1 and A2), is composed of 17 genes up-regulated by both fungal races in the first 24 hours of the infection but enhanced expression is subsequently maintained only in the plants infected by race 49 at the later time points (up to 96 HAI). Genes in this group include those annotated as plant defense (35% of this group) containing PR1, wound induced protein 2 (WIN2) genes, cell-wall related (i.e., a cell-wall invertase gene), and signal transduction regulation category with a G-box binding protein PG2 or sensory transduction histidine kinase genes. These genes are likely involved in the defense pathways induced by a fungal-PAMP since they have the same expression pattern during the first 24 hours of infection independent of the fungal race used. For example, the wound-induced protein WIN2 protein has anti-fungal activity [32] and possesses a domain that can bind a well known PAMP, chitin [33] . The formation of haustoria by the fungus in the plant can occur within hours of infection [34] . After successful colonization of the bean cell, rust race 41 likely secretes effector proteins that can suppress the plant defense pathway induced by PAMPs. The initial induction of genes such as WIN2 by race 41 and their subsequent reduction in expression may be associated with this suppression of defense by the virulent pathogen only. The second group, group B, is composed of 16 genes that were induced at the beginning of the infection but were slightly down-regulated at the later time points independent of the fungal race. This group is rich in genes categorized as plant defense representing 56% of this group. The third group, group C (C1 and C2), is composed of 5 genes that appeared to be repressed by inoculation. In group C1, the genes were repressed during the first 12 hours by both races but this repression was only maintained at later time points (i.e., 72 and 96 HAI) in tissues infected with race 49. In contrast to group C2, the apparent repression of genes occurred only after 72 HAI with both races. The fourth group, group D, consists of 35 genes that were repressed in the first 12 hours by both races and subsequently expressed at levels comparable to the uninfected tissue. The genes repressed specifically at the early time points could also be involved in the basal defense response. This pool is composed of ESTs known to be involved in plant defense pathways [e.g., chitinase class 1 [35] , an auxin response factor 4 and an auxin conjugate hydrolase [36] , and a MLO-like protein 8 [37] ]. Finally, the fifth group represents 18 genes that gave no discernable pattern of expression.",

These genes share different expression patterns but are likely involved in the basal defense response, which is induced by PAMPs. These genes were induced by both races at the early time points but their regulation was often maintained only in plants infected by the fungus race 49. This may be due to the inability of this avirulent pathogen to suppress the plant Ranking of bean genes based on their expression stability measured by qRT-PCR Figure 3 Ranking of bean genes based on their expression stability measured by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of three putative constitutive genes (TC127, cons6, and cons7) was measured during infection by both fungal race 41 and 49 in order to identify the best reference gene for qRT-PCR normalization. Genes with the most stable expression during the conditions tested are on the right of the diagram, the less stably expressed being on the left. Figure generated by geNorm software. <::::: Least stable genes Most stable genes ::::> Average expression stability M defense system. The same observation was made also by Lee et al. (2008) at the protein level. Lee et al. (2008) proposed a new model for plant disease resistance where Rgene mediated resistance is integrated into the basal immunity system of the plant and functions primarily to restore the innate immunity response that is actively suppressed by virulent pathogens [38] . Similar patterns of expression, independent of the pathogen virulence, were observed in Arabidopsis [39] and barley [40] . Another category of genes (i.e. cell-wall invertase or amino acid transporter-like protein 1) involved in the plant defense system are likely involved in the HR and were regulated only at the later time points in plants infected by the race 49 fungus. The expression of these genes may be the result of recognition of AvrUR-4 by the Ur-4 resistance protein and lead to the presence of HR ten days after infection with this isolates.",

The Bacterial artificial chromosome-ends (BAC) of the clones were sequenced and provide a powerful tool for integrated genomic and genetic analysis. This recent release of the Phaseolus physical map http://phaseo lus.genomics.purdue.edu/ allowed linkage of some of the 10,221 unisequences to the physical map by comparison to BAC-end sequences. The number of ESTs matching a BAC-end sequence was assessed using the minimal criteria of 98% sequence identity spanning 100 bp. As a result, 1,704 unisequences, more than 15% of the total library, could be linked to the physical map (see additional file 2: excel file of the 1,704 unisequences having a hit with a BAC-end sequence). Fourteen of these sequences located to physical contig 1 that is composed of 999 BACs. The genetic mapping of these ESTs might be facilitated by the presence of genetic markers anchoring BACs within the various contigs.This physical map was made from common bean cultivar G19833. The number of putative SNP between the BACend sequences and the ESTs (common bean cultivar Early gallatin) was identified among the 1,704 matching ESTs. Six hundred seventy ESTs showed a perfect match with a BAC-end sequence, 414 ESTs exhibited only 1 mismatch, 258 ESTs contained 2 mismatches and 362 ESTs had 3 or more mismatches. This represents an average of 1 SNP/ indel every 570 bp.",
