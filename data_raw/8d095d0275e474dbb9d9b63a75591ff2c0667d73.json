They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 59 untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai.",

Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 59 UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 39UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed.",

In the present study, we looked for HRVs in a 2-year collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of children with ARI visiting a district hospital in Shanghai, and compared sequences in two regions previously defined for genetic classification of HRV serotypes [13, 15] . Our study showed a high diversity of HRV species and genotypes, and a prevalence of the novel HRV-C species in NPSs of children with bronchitis and pneumonia. This biodiversity appeared to result partly from recombination events in the 59UTR, between HRV-C strains and those close or similar to HRV-A species, which led to the suggested classification of HRV-C into at least two subspecies.",

Sixty-four samples (7.7%) were positive for HRV, according to the length of the amplified fragment in the VP4/VP2 region visualized on agarose gel (data not shown). A larger fragment of 924 nt, including part of the 59UTR (starting at nt 163) and the VP4/VP2 genes (ending at nt 1086), was amplified and cloned into plasmid vectors for genetic analysis (Table 1) . Only one sample, N1, could not be amplified and was amplified in two steps in the 59UTR (nt 163-552) and in the VP4/VP2 region (nt 528-1086), respectively. Analyses of different clones for each sample allowed the identification of multiple infections: sample N16 was shown to contain one HRV-A and one HRV-B (N16A and N16B, respectively), while N58 contained one HRV-A and one HRV-C (N58A and N58C, respectively) (see below). In order to further characterize the 66 HRVs identified in the 64 samples, the nucleotide sequences located in the 59UTR (285 nt) and the VP4/VP2 genes (420 nt) were chosen to allow comparative alignment with sequences of reference serotypes and field strains available in GenBank.",

HRV-Ca nucleotide sequences were scanned against sequences of N10, R16 and R52, which are considered as representative strains of HRV Cc subspecies and HRV-A and HRV-B species, respectively. Stretches of nucleotide sequences that were closer to HRV-A (R16) than to HRV-Cc (N10), flanked by sequences related to HRV-C could be detected in the 59UTR of HRV-Ca strains, as exemplified with HRV-Ca N25 strain ( Fig. 3a and b) . These HRV-A-related nucleotide stretches were thus flanked by putative recombination sites. These sites were located differently among the HRV-Ca strains, delimiting HRV-A-related stretches that ranged from 150 to 400 nt in length (Fig. 3c ). While variable among the strains, the identified recombination sites were all located inside the 59 UTR and none of them was identified in the downstream VP4/VP2 coding sequence. HRV-A-related nucleotide sequences and putative recombination sites were also found in the 59UTR of the previously described HRV-C strains C024, C025, C026, NAT001, NAT045 and QPM (Fig. 3) . The results corroborated the clustering observed in the phylogenetic tree based on 59UTR sequences (Fig. 2) , since strains gathered in the same HRV-Ca subcluster (for example N24, N25, N28 and N32, or N4, N7, N8, N21, N36 and N46) displayed the same recombination pattern.

The full-length N10 genome sequence was compared to those of the HRV-Ca subspecies strains C024, C025 and C026, and to that of N4 strain, which was sequenced as the representative of the HRV-Ca subspecies.

In particular, footprints including deletions in the BC, DE and HI loops and conserved amino acids potentially involved in Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) receptor binding [7, 11, 20, 24] were conserved within the HRV-C species (data not shown). Bootscanning and similarity plot analysis conducted on the genomic sequences of N4 (HRV-Ca), N10 (HRV-Cc), R16 (HRV-A) and R52 (HRV-B) confirmed that N4 featured a 59UTR sequence that was related to the R16 sequence (stretch I), followed by a capsidic sequence related to the N10 sequence. N4 nonstructural sequence (2A to 39UTR) was related more closely to N10 than to R16 and R52 sequences. However, in stretch II (nt 3300-3500 according to N4 numbering), N4 strain (HRV-Ca) was closer to R16 (HRV-A) than to R52 (HRV-B) or N10 (HRV-Cc), which resulted in high bootstrap values between N4 and R16 2A sequences (Fig. 4) . This may have been the result of a recombination event that occurred in the 39 part of the 2A-encoding sequence of the parental strain N4, and which involved an HRV-A strain. Nevertheless, the HRV-A parental strain or ancestral strain could not be identified since the closest HRV-A 2A nucleotide sequence available was ,80% identical to that of N4 in this region.",

Interestingly, different HRV genotypes were detected within the same period (for example, N1 and N4, N9 and N11/N12, N44/N48 and N51, and N55/N56 and N62/N67), with a larger diversity and distribution of individual or paired HRV-A genotypes compared to HRV-C strains, which clustered in closely-related genotypes (Fig. 2, Tables 2 and 3) . Conversely, N4 and N21 strains of samples collected at 10 months interval showed 99.8% identity (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "In this report, we looked for HRVs in a 2-year collection of NPSs from children with ARI visiting a district hospital in Shanghai, and found a high diversity of HRV strains that belonged to different species and genotypes. We characterized by RT-PCR and sequenced 66 HRVs, among them 27 HRV-A, five HRV-B, and 34 HRV-C strains. When sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome, several recent studies have identified new strains of viruses from children and adults with ARI, asthma, or otitis, which are clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and have been classified into a novel HRV-C species [7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28] . Other groups have also identified novel HRV-C strains by sequencing the VP1 gene [29] or the 59UTR [14, 15] . The different sizes and locations of the regions amplified in the HRV genomes renders difficult comparative genetic analysis. Recently, Palmenberg et al. (2009) have finalized the full-length genome sequences of all HRV-A and HRV-B reference strains, and identified structural features of these two species and the novel HRV-C species [16] . In our study, we identified 34 HRVs (51.5%) that clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B in a phylogenetic tree that was established on the basis of VP4/VP2 sequences, which were related to recent strains classified in the novel HRV-C species (Fig. 1, Table 2 ). Fourteen HRV-C strains (41.2%) segregated from the other 20 strains (58.8%) that were closely related to HRV-A in their 59UTR sequence (Fig. 2) . This led us to propose a classification of two HRV-C subspecies, HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca. In previous studies [15] . These strains clustered with our field strains within the HRV-Cc subspecies. Moreover, 17 strains that clustered with HRV-A, and had 12-35% pairwise nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference serotype [15] , clustered within the two major branches of HRV-A and HRV-Ca strains (Fig. 3) . Therefore, we cannot ensure that some of the 17 strains were HRV-A or HRV-Ca strains. Kiang et al. (2008) have identified five novel HRVs out of 24 clinical samples (20.8%), which segregated from HRV-A and HRV-B, and were classified as HRV-C, and three additional strains (12.5%) that also clustered with QPM, C024, C025, C026, NAT001 and NAT045 [14] (Fig. 2) . However, the field HRV strains of these previous studies were sequenced using a 59UTR that did not match fully our sequence and that of Lee et al. (2007) [15] , and could not be included in the present study for comparative analysis. Interestingly, the five strains identified in California in 2007 [14] and N42 and N45 from our study were closely related to strain W37 isolated in Wisconsin in the late 1990s [15] , and to NAT001 isolated in the winter of 2004 in California [18] , which confirms that similar genotypes of HRV-Ca are widespread [17] .",

Analyzing sequences that covered the 59UTR and the downstream VP4/ VP2 capsid region allowed identification of co-infections when several clones were sequenced, and helped to locate the recombination sites in strains of the HRV-Ca subspecies.

Previous comparison of genome sequences between 34 HRVs showed only limited recombination events and a pattern of genetic diversity lower than that observed with other picornaviruses [25] . The presence in HRV-C subspecies of sequences that share 90.5-98.6% identity with HRV-A strains (Table 3) suggests that recombination events occurred between HRV-C and HRV-A. Bootscanning of the 59UTR of HRV-C strains also showed different sites and lengths of recombination (Fig. 3c) , which suggested that there were several independent events that led to several groups of HRV-Ca genotypes, which formed clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) .",

These findings are in agreement with those observed for other HEVs, for which recombination events in the capsid-encoding sequence are very rare, probably because of structural constraints that restrict the functioning of chimeric capsids [31] . This result appeals for the full-length genome sequencing of the major representatives of the HRV-C species, in order to establish a clear understanding of the evolution and classification of the novel virus into subspecies. Comparison of the coding sequences of N10 HRV-Cc with other strains of HRV-Ca subspecies [20] , including our field strain N4, showed high similarities in the lengths of the 11 proteins, their cleavage sites, and the structural features of VP1. These characteristics and the absence of growth in cell culture, noted in our laboratory and by others (data not shown), support the classification of the novel strains into a unique HRV-C subspecies.",

The remarkable outcome of the study is the large diversity of genotypes that has circulated in a relatively small group of people in a district of Shanghai during a 2-year observation. Although some clusters of similar genotypes in a limited period of time were observed, co-circulation of different genotypes and HRV species and subspecies, and co-infections with two HRV species were observed. The prevalence of the novel HRV-C in our specimens (4.1%) differed from previous studies that associated the prevalence of the novel variant with severe disease outcomes, which ranged from influenza-like illness or infection of the low respiratory tract [17, 28] to asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, and febrile wheeze [7, 8, 15, 18, 20, 21, 29, 39] . All our patients showed bronchitis or pneumonia, with no etiological correlation with any of the species or subspecies of HRV. Only one patient co-infected with HRV-C, IAV and RSV was diagnosed with asthma among the HRV-positive patients (1.6%), whereas 100 of the 827 children had asthma (12%). The difference observed with previous studies, 44.6% [8] and 12% [29] asthma in HRV-positive patients, may be related to the criteria for enrolment. Moreover, none of the patients in our study were hospitalized, which makes comparison with hospitalized children difficult [20, 24] . Another criterion to consider in the trend to correlate clinical symptoms with HRV infection is the presence of co-infecting pathogens. In our study, four strains of HBoV and six strains of RSV (17.6%) were identified in association with HRV-C (11.7%). HBoV and RSV are common viruses diagnosed in ARI, which are often associated with HRV [40, 41] , and HBoV was identified in .50% of children co-infected with HRV [20] . Nevertheless, the incidence of HBoV in ARI and in severe outcomes remains elusive [42] . More studies need to be carried out on large numbers of samples from severe and mild diseases, to identify any obvious role of HRV sequence diversity and association with other pathogens in disease severity. Since a large diversity of recombination in HRVs has become obvious, we must be aware of the occurrence of novel HRVs that may become highly virulent.",

Amplification programs included reverse transcription at 50uC for 30 min, inactivation at 95uC for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94uC for 30 s, 50uC for 30 s, 72uC for 70 s, and final extension at 72uC for 10 min. The amplified DNA products were detected by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis. The lengths of P1-VP2, VP4-VP2 and P1-P3 amplicons were 924, 559 and 390 nt, respectively. DNA products were extracted from agarose gels by using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and were ligated into pMD20-T vector (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), and at least two recombinant plasmids were sequenced in Biosune Sequence Company and Life Biotechnology in Shanghai, China. Sequences of different clones of N16 and N58 showed identities for either HRV-A or HRV-B strains. More plasmids were sequenced for these strains to confirm that the two patients were originally coinfected with two different HRV species.",

            "text": "Sequences of three complete genomes of HRV were obtained for strains N4 (reference R3061207002 collected on December 7, 2006) , N10 (R3070614001 collected on June 14, 2007) and N13 (R3070719007 collected on July 19 2007). Primers used for the amplification of viral genomes were designed after multiple alignments of sequences from the genomes of different HRVs available in GenBank (Table 1) . Overlapping amplified DNA products were obtained after PCR of cDNA that was obtained using oligodT and a Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 10.4 ml viral RNA was mixed with 1 ml oligodT and heated at 65uC for 10 min, and then kept on ice for 2 min. After addition of 4 ml 56buffer, 0.5 ml Protector RNase Inhibitor, 2 ml dNTPs, 1 ml DTT, and 1 ml RT enzyme, the reaction was incubated at 50uC for 1 h, inactivated at 85uC for 5 min, and stored at 220uC. Amplification of a 3D region of N4, N10 and N13 HRV strains was carried out by nested-PCR using Takara EXTaq (Takara Biotechnology) and specific primers (Table 1) , for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 55uC, and 70 s at 72uC. To amplify VP1 (upstream of 2A) sequences of N4 and N13 strains, nested PCR was carried out using Takara LATaq with GC buffer I(Takara Biotechnology), specific primers (Table 1) , and incubation for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 60uC, and 4 min at 68uC. The fragment VP2-3D of N10 HRV strain was obtained by seminested PCR and specific primers VP2 F, and 3D inner and outer reverse primers (Table 1) , using Takara LATaq with GC buffer II, for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 60uC, and 6 min at 68uC. The terminal part of the whole genome was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using 59/39 rapid amplification of the cDNA kit, following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche). To perform 59 terminal RACE, 4 ml of 56cDNA buffer, 2 ml dNTPs, 1.25 ml specific primer 1 (10 mM), 9.2 ml RNA, 1 ml control primer neo1/rev (12.5 mM), 1 ml control RNA, 1 ml RT enzyme, and 0.6 ml RNase inhibitor (Roche) were mixed and incubated for 55uC for 60 min, followed by inactivation at 85uC for 5 min, and stored on ice. The product was purified using the Qiagen PCR Purification Kit and eluted with 30 ml deionized distilled water. A polyA tail was added to the cDNA, by mixing 9.5 ml DNA with 1.25 ml 106 reaction buffer, 1.25 ml (2 mM) dATP, and after incubation at 95uC for 3 min, the reaction was chilled on ice for 2 min. After addition of 0.5 ml terminal transferase, the reaction was incubated at 37uC for 30 min, inactivated at 70uC for 10 min, and kept on ice. Nested PCR was performed by using the Expend High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche). A mixture of 2.5 ml poly-dA-tailed cDNA, 0.5 ml oligodT-anchor primer 37.5 mM, 0.62 ml SP2 primers (10 mM) (Table 1) , 0.5 ml control neo2/rev primer (12.5 mM), 0.5 ml dNTP, 0.35 ml enzyme, 2.5 ml 106 buffer, and 18 ml ddH 2 O was incubated for 40 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 60uC, and 30 s at 72uC. To perform 39 terminal RACE, the method was similar to normal two-step RT-PCR using 3D inner and outer F primers (Table 1) .",
