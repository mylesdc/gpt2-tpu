A number of public health issues significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the UAE. This article summarises the findings of a panel of medical and public health specialists from UAE University and various government health agencies commissioned to report on the health status of the UAE population. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed articles on health in the UAE, and unpublished data were provided by government health authorities and local hospitals. Results: The panel reviewed and evaluated all available evidence to list and rank (1 0highest priority) the top four main public health issues: 1) Cardiovascular disease accounted for more than 25% of deaths in 2010; 2) Injury caused 17% of mortality for all age groups in 2010; 3) Cancer accounted for 10% of all deaths in 2010, and the incidence of all cancers is projected to double by 2020; and 4) Respiratory disorders were the second most common non-fatal condition in 2010. Conclusion: The major public health challenges posed by certain personal (e.g. ethnicity, family history), lifestyle, occupational, and environmental factors associated with the development of chronic disease are not isolated to the UAE; rather, they form part of a global health problem, which requires international collaboration and action. Future research should focus on population-based public health interventions that target the factors associated with the development of various chronic diseases.",

Migrant workers are recruited from all over the world to satisfy the manpower demands of the fast-paced economic and industrial developments in the UAE (4) . Consequently, the UAE population has increased substantially over the past four decades, and this is primarily due to the high net inward migration of expatriate workers (population estimates: 287,000 in 1971, 4.1 million in 2005, 8.3 million in 2010) (5) . Indeed, mass recruitment of migrant workers has created an unusual population structure, with the total UAE population composed of approximately 11% (950,000) Emiratis, and the rest expatriates of varying nationalities (6) . Similarly, the total population of Abu Dhabi (the largest emirate in the UAE) is estimated to be 2.3 million, with over half of the population being expatriate males aged 20\u00c159 years (6) .",

A decline in birth rates has been attributed to urbanisation, changing attitudes about family size, and improved education and work opportunities for women resulting in delayed marriage.

However, communicable diseases were not included in the top four public health priority areas, as the UAE is considered a high-income country (based on global economic indicators) that is deemed to have passed through the epidemiologic transition (3) . As such, the burden of infectious and parasitic diseases in the UAE is low due to improvements in the standard of living and both the quality and availability of health care services. To prevent the re-emergence or outbreaks of infectious disease, the UAE has invested significant resources into population-based control measures, such as immunisation, surveillance, and the availability of post-exposure treatment (where possible). One major public health achievement in the UAE is the success rate of the national immunisation program for children under the age of 5 years. Due to the high uptake of immunisation, the rates of childhood communicable diseases in the UAE are very low. In addition, all expatriate workers seeking employment in the UAE are screened for communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis (by chest X-ray) and human immunodeficiency virus (by serology), before acquiring residence status. Additional screening for other communicable diseases is required for certain occupational categories, such as healthcare workers, cooks, house maids, and drivers.",

Consequently, there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The World Health Organisation estimates that the burden of chronic diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide, with the largest increase in cardiovascular disease occurring in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Indeed, the UAE has one of the highest agestandardised death rates for cardiovascular disease in the world, that is, 308.9 per 100,000 for males and 203.9 per 100,000 for females. Recent mortality statistics for the emirate of Abu Dhabi in 2010 reveal that 29% of all deaths were due to cardiovascular disease (10) . In the absence of any major changes in lifestyle risk factors at a population level, these rates are set to increase further as the youthful population ages.",

The main circumstances contributing to death from injury were traffic-related injuries, followed by falls and drowning (Fig. 1) 100,000 (11\u00c115). The predominant cause of death for this age group was traffic injury (62%; IR 13.6), followed by drowning (11%; IR 1.5) and falls (10%; IR 1.5). More males were injured compared to females (male:female ratio 01.78:1) (1). Analysis of the 2010 dataset revealed that injury remained the second leading cause of mortality accounting for 17% of all deaths in the UAE (17) . The World Health Organisation estimates the traffic death rate in the UAE as 37.1 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants per year, which is several times higher than the equivalent rates in developed Western countries, such as Australia (7.8 per 100,000 population) and the United Kingdom (5.4 per 100,000 population) (18) . Recent estimates from the emirate of Abu Dhabi report that occupational injury and occupational road traffic injuries accounted for 16% of all injury deaths in 2011 (19) .

The incidence of all cancers is projected to double by 2020, primarily due to ageing and also possibly due to increased exposure to risk factors for cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Emirati females (and the most prevalent cancer in both sexes combined), lung cancer is the most common cancer amongst Emirati males but is extremely rare in females, which reflects the prevalence of smoking (23.0% vs. 0.5%, respectively), and colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in both sexes combined (Table 3 ) (20, 21) . However, rates for all three types of cancer are much lower than most Western countries and are also lower than in Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. This is likely to be due to the younger age of the population, less exposure to some risk factors, lower levels of screening compared to Western countries, and possibly incomplete registration. Rates for all three types of cancer are also projected to double by the year 2020 as the UAE population ages, total fertility declines, exposure time to lifestyle risk factors increases, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes increases, and due to the long latency period between starting smoking and developing lung cancer. Population-based education and awareness campaigns are urgently required to increase screening rates for at-risk individuals and to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thereby reducing morbidity and improving survival.",
