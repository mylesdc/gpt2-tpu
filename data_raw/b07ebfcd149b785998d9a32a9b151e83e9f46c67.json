We assessed if clinical characteristics and blood inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia. Methods: Western Australian children (\u226417 years) hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were recruited and clinical symptoms and management data were collected. C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell counts (WCC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were measured as part of routine care. Clinical characteristics and biomarker levels were compared between cases with definite bacterial pneumonia (clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural fluid), presumed viral pneumonia (presence of \u22651 virus in nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia), and other pneumonia cases (pneumonia in the absence of criteria for either definite bacterial or presumed viral pneumonia). The area-under-curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for varying biomarker levels were used to characterise their utility for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia. For biomarkers with AUC > 0.8 (fair discriminator), Youden index was measured to determine the optimal cut-off threshold, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative) were calculated. We investigated whether better discrimination could be achieved by combining biomarker values with the presence/absence of symptoms.",

Several studies have assessed the utility of non-specific inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant released in response to cytokine interleukin-6, white cell count (WCC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to discriminate probable bacterial infections from non-bacterial infections and also to assess the severity of illness [7, 8] . Bacterial pneumonia has been associated with higher CRP, WCC and ANC than viral pneumonia [8] [9] [10] [11] , while some studies have found no difference in biomarkers among bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia [12, 13] . Even studies that report differences in these biomarkers cannot determine any reliable thresholds for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia [10, 14] . Previous studies were also affected by small sample size, use of less sensitive methods for pathogen detection which could have resulted an inaccurate categorization of bacterial and viral cases [12, 14] . Furthermore, studies have been conducted in low-income settings where the contribution of bacterial infection may be higher and where children are at higher risk of other infectious diseases that could influence the biomarker levels and confound the analysis [10] .",

The study hospital is the only publically-funded tertiary paediatric hospital for a total population of 2.6 million in Western Australia. We followed a pragmatic definition of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (infiltrates or alveolar consolidation as determined by the treating clinician) facilitating recruitment after hours (i.e. when a radiologist is not available to review the chest x-ray) [18] . The study design and eligibility criteria were published previously [17] . Existing or ever diagnosed with any comorbidity was not considered as exclusion criteria.",

There were few differences between children with definite bacterial pneumonia, and those with presumed viral pneumonia, and other pneumonias which were neither definite bacterial nor presumed viral. CRP, WCC and ANC were higher in definite bacterial pneumonia and the CRP had value for distinguishing these from presumed viral and other pneumonias. The combination of high CRP with either fever \u226538.0\u00b0C or with absence of rhinorrhoea increased the specificity and PPV compared to elevated CRP alone with little loss in sensitivity, suggesting that combining biomarkers with clinical features is of diagnostic value. Timely identification of pneumonia aetiology could improve clinical management including decisions about the use of antibiotics. In line with previous studies, the clinical signs and symptoms among cases of definite bacterial and presumed viral pneumonia overlapped and were insufficiently specific in themselves to reliably differentiate one from the other [5, 24] . Our findings are mostly consistent with previous studies which have associated viral pneumonia with low grade fever, tachypnoea, rhinorrhoea and wheezing [4, [25] [26] [27] . We did not attempt to distinguish cases based on specific radiographic features, but others have not found any radiographic feature that can reliably distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia [14, 28, 29] .",

In UK children, Elemraid et al. found a higher CRP, WCC and ANC in those with bacterial compared to viral pneumonia, with a CRP level > 80 mg/L reportedly distinguishing severe bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia [9] . The sensitivity and specificity for CRP > 80 mg/L for differentiating bacterial versus viral/atypical pneumonia in children with communityacquired pneumonia was 71 and 52%, respectively, in Norway [11] and was 52 and 72%, respectively, in Finland [14] . We found that CRP had better discriminatory utility (AUC > 0.8) than the WCC or ANC, consistent with findings similar settings [9, 11, 14] . The optimum CRP threshold for differentiating definite bacterial from presumed viral and other pneumonia had only moderate predictive value which could limit its use as a sole criterion for antibiotic decision-making in clinical settings. Serum procalcitonin is not routinely used in our study setting, so we could not assess its value for distinguishing bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonias. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a better biomarker for bacterial sepsis than CRP [30] , while other found serum CRP as better predictor for lobar consolidation and pleural effusion than PCT [31] .",

Furthermore, purulent pleural effusions are generally considered to be of bacterial origin even if bacteria cannot be detected. Respiratory viruses are usually detectable in the nasopharynx of children with viral pneumonias, but may also be detectable in healthy children [16, 33, 34] . In the absence of any gold standard microbiological assays for distinguishing bacterial from viral and mixed infections, we categorised cases based on whether they were highly likely to be bacterial (definite), most likely viral (presumed), or possibly either based on whether bacteria were detected in sterile sites, respiratory viruses were detected in the nasopharynx, or neither. This pragmatic approach to classification reflects the limitations of current methods, and some misclassification is likely to have occurred. Previous studies categorised cases as either bacterial or viral, are were more limited due to lower pathogen detection rates and by the use of less sensitive assays [8, 9, 12, 14, 26] . The strength of this study is that the range of pathogens tested covered virtually all important bacteria and viruses associated with childhood pneumonia using sensitive molecular techniques.",

            "text": "Empiric use of antibiotics remains as cornerstone of treating pneumonia in the absence of effective point-of-care diagnostics for differentiating bacterial from viral infection. Many children who have viral pneumonia will continue to receive antibiotics without benefit. Early reliable detection of viral pneumonia, or early exclusion of bacterial pneumonia, could reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy, thereby mitigating the risk of emerging antibiotic resistance [36] . While we have been unable to identify a single biomarker or clinical feature that could be used to confidently distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia, our findings suggest there may be utility in more sophisticated algorithms that integrate a number of clinical, microbiological, inflammatory biomarker, or radiological factors to improve pneumonia diagnostics and better targeting therapies.",

            "text": "Additional file 1: Table S1 shows the distribution of four common respiratory bacteria detected by PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab from children who had definite bacterial pneumonia or presumed viral pneumonia or other pneumonia. This table informs readers if the bacteria in upper respiratory tract, nasopharynx, varies in pneumonia cases who had detectable bacteria in sterile body fluids such as blood and/or pleural fluid compared to those who did not have detectable bacteria in sterile body fluids but had detectable respiratory viruses in nasopharynx and to those who did not have either. Table S2 shows the distribution three blood biomarkers, CRP, WCC and ANC, among definite bacterial pneumonia cases who had empyema, bacteraemia and both empyema and bacteraemia. We found that definite bacterial cases had increased level of blood biomarkers than presumed viral pneumonia or other pneumonia cases ( Table 2) . We further analysed within the definite bacterial case group to see if these blood biomarkers varies among complicated pneumonia cases (empyema), cases who had bacteraemia (presence of bacteria in blood) and cases who had both empyema and bacteraemia. Table S3 shows the different diagnostic values such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for different cut-off values of CRP level to differentiate definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral and from presumed viral plus other pneumonias. CRP was found to have capacity to distinguish definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral and other pneumonia. While we found CRP level \u2265 72 mg/L was the optimal cutoff point (Table 3) , we further assessed the diagnostic values at different CRP levels alone and also in presence/absence of other clinical symptoms to understand the discriminatory analysis between definite bacterial pneumonia and viral and other pneumonia.
