This involves inoculating a portion of the material or biological agent containing the sample to be moved to a medium capable of supporting growth of the target organism and evaluating for the presence of agent after sufficient incubation time has passed to allow any viable organisms present to amplify to a detectable level (i.e., colonies on a plate, turbidity in broth). The media and assays used to detect viable organisms will vary depending on the target agents. For human pathogenic viruses, sterility testing is an involved process that begins with inoculation of a portion of the sample of interest into a permissive cell culture line. Depending on the sample, which may contain materials toxic to the cell culture line or require an extended incubation to ensure detectable quantities of virus are present, additional rounds of cell culture amplification may be employed. Once sufficient time has passed to allow amplification of surviving virus, a detection assay such as a plaque assay, immunomicrotitration, or immunofluorescence is performed. The detection of viable agent indicates the process of inactivation was insufficient, and the sample may not be moved to a lower biocontainment area.",

In this sense, inactivation refers to the use of a tested and validated method known to sufficiently and repeatedly render a sample sterile. Materials Viruses 2015, 7, 5875-5888; doi:10.3390/v7112912 www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses inactivated using a well-documented and validated inactivation procedure may be moved to a lower biocontainment level, transported, and disposed of without a sterility test. An example of a widely accepted inactivation method is autoclaving; with the process performed correctly and the equipment maintained and operating within normal parameters, and with suitable verification of a full, effective cycle such as biological indicators or machine read-outs, the material subjected to the process is considered sterile. Sterility tests are not performed on every sample that undergoes autoclaving as a method of disposal. Various formulations of formaldehyde have been widely utilized for the inactivation of virus preparations [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, like autoclaving, this method renders the samples unusable for molecular, genomic and/or immunological methods [5] [6] [7] .",

The use of TRIzol LS for the inactivation of viral agents has been a standard accepted method for a number of institutions for decades.

Conventional methods to confirm sterility begin with placing a portion of the inactivated sample on a cell culture layer to provide an opportunity for any surviving virus to infect and grow in sufficient quantity to be detectable by observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) or other detection methods. The toxicity of the TRIzol LS in undiluted, treated viral samples causes almost immediate death of the cell culture layer used for sterility testing. Previous studies have diluted the TRIzol LS-inactivated samples 100-and 1000-fold and still observed tissue culture cell death [9] . While the sterility tests in these studies were negative for the presence of viral agents, it must be noted that the tests could only be performed on treated samples that were diluted many thousand fold and were no longer toxic to the tissue culture cells, so the possibility remains in such scenarios that the presence of small numbers of surviving virus would elude detection.",

Methods such as dialysis and spin column filtration were investigated, but again the caustic nature of the reagent was problematic. Dialysis material is rated only for very small percentages of phenol (well below the concentration present in TRIzol LS-inactivated samples), and membrane filters were not resistant to phenol. Nevertheless, there is wide acceptance of the TRIzol LS method as a biocontainment laboratory standard for the inactivation of viruses based on historical data, precedent, and the known mechanism of action of the inactivating agent.",

            "text": "Investigation into the properties of psoralens led to the realization that this group of compounds might provide a method for inactivating viral agents while preserving structures needed for antigenic activity and nucleic acids for molecular or genomic analysis. Psoralens are small, photoreactive compounds that freely penetrate phospholipid bilayers and intercalate between nucleic acid pyrimidine residues, causing cross-linking and inactivation via inhibition of replication following exposure to UV-A radiation. Psoralens do not appear to interact with proteins and inactivation of viruses with psoralen may leave immunogenic surface epitopes intact [10] [11] [12] . The photo-crosslinking property of psoralens has been exploited to inactivate microorganisms in the blood supply [13] [14] [15] for the treatment of skin disorders [16] , to inactivate viral pathogens prior to organ transplantation, and for inactivation of viruses for potential vaccines [17] [18] [19] [20] . Neither exposure to psoralens alone nor exposure to long-wave UV light alone was sufficient to inactivate DNA or RNA viruses, and incubation with psoralens in the absence of UV light did not cause observable cell death [12] . We previously used dengue virus as a representative positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA(+)) genome virus and demonstrated inactivation of the virus with the psoralen compound 4 1 -aminomethyl-trioxsalen (AMT) [21, 22] . The inactivated dengue virus retained the ability to bind to a panel of five monoclonal antibodies specific for Dengue-2 (DENV-2) envelope protein and elicited a T-cell response in vaccinated mice similar to live, non-inactivated virus [10] . Here we extended the inactivation method to multiple virus families, and examined the suitability of psoralen-inactivated viral RNA for molecular biology applications such as reverse transcription PCR and sequencing. The antigenicity of inactivated virus in the production of antivirus antisera was also examined.",

Five-milliliter aliquots of the mixture were transferred into the wells of 6-well plates.

JUNV and RVFV required 90 min UV-A exposure for full inactivation. EBOV required 120 min UV-A exposure for full inactivation. At each time point, an aliquot was removed from the plates and the titer was determined by TCID 50 . Each aliquot was assayed for viability by virus isolation in Vero cells using indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay.",

Here, inactivation of DENV was assessed by TCID 50 , repeat TCID 50 after subculture, and IFA.

This is a significant change from the earlier plaque assay data and illustrates that rigorous testing methods must be used to confirm inactivation. Forty minutes of exposure to UV-A light in the presence of AMT was required to fully inactivate DENV as determined by CPE and IFA after two ten-day sequential cultures (Table 3 ).

All five targets were successfully amplified from AMT-inactivated DENV. Any photoadducts present in the genome after AMT treatment were not inhibitory to reverse transcription. The cycle in which the fluorescent signal was detectable above background (Ct) of reactions using inactivated virus was similar to the Ct of reactions using live, untreated virus (Table 5 ).

DENV RNA isolated from psoralen-inactivated preparations was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and subjected to whole genome sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq using a paired-end strategy of two 150 bp reads. Approximately 98% of the DENV genome was covered in 13,909 of 203,040,312 total reads. Sequencing coverage varied with the majority of the genome falling between 25-and 400-fold ( Figure 2 ).

The collected serum was used as the primary antibody in an IFA against live-virus infected tissue cultures. AMT-inactivated LASV and CCHFV elicited antibodies that specifically recognized untreated LASV and CCHFV, respectively. The antibodies generated against AMT-inactivated viruses were used at the same working dilutions in the IFA as antibodies against untreated virus ( Table 6 ), indicating that titer of each was similar in the serum. This suggests that the antigens on the surface of both live and inactivated viruses were recognized equally well by the rabbit immune system. Table 6 .

Some fluorescence was visible within the cells, indicating that the virus had been recognized by cell-surface receptors and internalized. The level of fluorescence was significantly lower than the level observed in the positive control cultures containing live virus (Figure 3) , even though similar amounts of virus were inoculated to the flask. This suggests that the amount of inactivated virus present did not increase during the 10-day incubation. After subculture and a second 10-day incubation, the level of fluorescence was very low and nearly indistinguishable from the negative control cultures. After two additional rounds of subculture and incubation for a total of 40 days in culture, there was no discernable virus in the culture inoculated with AMT-treated EBOV (as indicated by lack of CPE and lack of fluorescence by IFA, Figure 3d ), indicating that no viral replication had taken place and the virus was completely inactivated by the AMT and UV-A treatment.",

Among the families represented were spherical and flexuous viruses, as well as those with positive-and negative-sense RNA genomes, which suggests that the inactivation method will be successful for all RNA viruses. Each virus tested required a different amount of UV-A exposure in the presence of AMT for inactivation, and an increasing proportion of the virus particles became inactivated with increasing exposure to UV-A, indicating a dose-dependent response to the treatment. Rod-shaped viruses that use a polyprotein strategy required orders of magnitude more microwatts of UV-A than most segmented viruses for full inactivation. It is not known why such a large range of susceptibility to AMT + UV-A inactivation was observed. There does not seem to be a consistent set of virus characteristics that leads to the requirement for more exposure to AMT + UV-A for full inactivation. For example some enveloped, spherical viruses tested required only low levels of UV-A in the presence of AMT for full inactivation (CCHFV, H1N1p), while others required quite high levels (JUNV, RVFV). Virus concentration in the inactivation reaction, the type of virus, and the light conditions or UV-A intensity are all parameters that could conceivably alter the inactivation process. It is likely that each individual investigator will have to perform a titration experiment to define the appropriate conditions that consistently produce inactivation in their chosen virus system.",

We were able to use AMT-inactivated viruses as targets for antibody detection in IFA and FACS and as antigen for production of new polyclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antibodies produced against inactivated virus worked equally well for detecting untreated virus compared to antibodies produced against live virus preparations. These data taken together suggest that the surface proteins of the inactivated viruses are intact and correctly oriented, allowing full interactions with cells and protein complexes. This will allow viruses inactivated by this method to be used in vaccine development, in antibody generation for research, as positive controls for antibody-based detection assays, or studied by microscopy. The nucleic acids extracted from AMT-inactivated viruses were non-infectious and were sufficiently undamaged in EBOV, JUNV, LASV, MARV and RVFV to achieve successful detection by reverse-transcription real time PCR. The viral nucleic acids were non-infectious and sufficiently undamaged in DENV to be appropriate substrates for real time PCR and both Sanger and next-generation sequencing, thus supporting these methods at lower levels of biocontainment. Library-preparation attempts for next-generation sequencing using standard methods for AMT-inactivated LASV and VEEV were unsuccessful, which may indicate that the crosslinking of these viruses in our hands was too great to allow next-generation sequencing. However, amplicons of up to 971 base pairs were successfully detected by PCR, suggesting that number of photoadducts per genome is less than 1 per 1000 bases, at least in the case of DENV. The 3 1 end of the DENV genome was amplified as readily as an internal target, which suggests that the photoadducts are not concentrated near the ends of the virus. Most importantly, the method provides inactive, non-infectious virus preparations that may be reliably sterility tested without attempting to remove toxic chemicals from the preparations.",

More data are needed to determine if all members of families of viruses react the same to the treatment.
