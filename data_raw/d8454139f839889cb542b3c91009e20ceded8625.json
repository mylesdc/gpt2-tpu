            "text": "High-throughput multiplex detection techniques are designed for the rapid, sensitive and specific testing of large numbers of analytes (nucleic acid assays, immunoassays, enzyme assays, or receptor-ligands) in a single biological sample. These techniques enable analysis of large numbers of samples. On the other hand, there are also classical single reaction detection methods based on determination of nucleic acids such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Dunbar, 2006; Taylor et al., 2001) , quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Wuyts et al., 2015; Iannone et al., 2000) , reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Weis et al., 1992) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Bustin, 2000) , or antibody-based tests like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Engvall and Perlmann, 1971; Vanweeme and Schuurs, 1971 ) represent nowadays the \"gold diagnostic standard\" in many laboratories. Despite the previous implementation of these methods for routine rapid, sensitive, specific and cost-effective molecular diagnostics, their ability to simultaneously detect multiple analytes in a single reaction is limited and this limitation has yet to be overcome. The increasing amount of proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic sequence data from a large number of organisms accessible in public databases represents an exceptional opportunity for the development of new, multiplex detection technologies. The Luminex R xMAP technology (x = analyte, MAP = Multi-Analyte Profiling) that was invented in the late 1990s represents such a platform that can benefit from all the advances in DNA research (Angeloni et al., 2014) . Although PCR allows multiplex amplification of several targets in a single run xMAP as a methodology represents a significant step forward, and was designed with the aim of creating a high-throughput bioassay platform, enabling rapid, cost-effective, and simultaneous analysis of multiple analytes within a single biological sample. As an open architecture platform, the xMAP system holds many benefits for the end user and therefore it is used in pharmaceutical, clinical and research laboratories (Dunbar and Li, 2010) . The main aim of this review is to summarize the state-of-the-art of xMAP technology applications in the detection of viral, bacterial, parasitical and fungal pathogens from different matrices.",

In contrast to the conventional microarray technology where the identity of the analyte is characterized by its position on the glass slide, the xMAP technology uses different sets of microspheres in a liquid suspension as determiners of analyte specificity. Microsphere sets are internally dyed with two spectrally different fluorophores. The spectral signature is unique for each microsphere set and is determined by different concentrations of internal dyes, producing a 100-member array of spectrally distinct microsphere sets (Figure 1 ). Integration of a third internal dye has allowed the expansion of up to 500-member microsphere sets (Dunbar and Li, 2010) . The surface of each microsphere set allows a simple chemical coupling of various reagents specific to a particular bioassay, such as nucleic acid assays, immunoassays, enzyme assays or receptor-ligand assays. A further fluorescent reporter (e.g., Streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin, Alexa 532, Cy3) is coupled to a target molecule, which allows its detection after specific capture on the microsphere surface.",

Different concentrations of red and infrared fluorophores were used to create 100 distinct microsphere sets. Each set is able to conjugate to a specific target molecule (yellow and orange lines = nucleic acid; green star = fluorescent reporter). determined by the type of instrumentation used for detection and the particular analyte of interest (Dunbar and Li, 2010; Houser, 2012) . Basic microspheres are 5.6 \u00b5m polystyrene beads whose surface is covered by approximately 10 8 carboxyl groups (COOH) for covalent coupling of capture reagents (Tang and Stratton, 2006) . Magnetic microspheres (Figure 2 ) differ in size and structure through the addition of a magnetite layer (Dunbar and Li, 2010; Houser, 2012) . Usage of magnetic beads improves washing efficiency as the magnetic separation step enables the elimination of unwanted sample constituents. Moreover, MagPlex-TAG microspheres are covalently pre-coupled with unique 24 base pair-(bp)-long anti-TAG oligonucleotides that serve as an anchor for target sequences containing the complementary TAG sequence. This proprietary TAG system (xTAG technology) is optimized to have minimum cross-reactivity. An assay can be easily designed by adding a complementary TAG sequence into the sequence of the primer or detection probe of interest and hybridization to the anti-TAG sequence on the microsphere surface.",

In direct DNA hybridization (DDH), allele-specific primer extension (ASPE), single base chain extension (SBCE), and Oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) all the target DNA sequences are amplified in multiplex PCR prior to hybridization to microspheres. The disadvantage of these methods is that in assays containing large amounts of targets multiplex PCR leads to amplification bias, which is caused by the different lengths of the amplicons (Nolan et al., 2001) . In contrast, in the multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay (MOL-PCR) sequence discrimination by detection probes occurs before the amplification step, which can subsequently be run just in singleplex PCR with universal primers.",

The subsequent incubation of amplicon with microspheres leads to a direct and specific hybridization between matching capture and target sequences.

Single-analyte ELISA cannot support simultaneous detection of multiple specific antibody responses within a single serum sample (Bokken et al., 2012) , and has further disadvantages, such as the requirement for a relatively large amount of sample, negligible non-specific binding or increased background. MBMIs represent an alternative for commonly used indirect tests like ELISA. The conversion of an ELISA assay to the MBMI format is uncomplicated, efficient, cost-saving and produces an assay with superior dynamic range and sensitivity (Baker et al., 2012) . MBMIs are often used in the diagnostics of various pathogens including multicellular organisms, such as e.g., parasites, in tests where the current methods are not sensitive enough. The methods of choice are usually Capture Sandwich (CS) and Indirect Serological Assay (ISA) (Figure 9) . However, the problems typical for methods based on serology remain: the need for periodical testing in order to avoid false negative results resulting from a wide and inevitable lag between infection and development of a specific response against a parasite in the form of IgG antibodies (sero-positivity) (Nockler et al., 1995) .",

Qualitative detection of a panel including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A virus (influenza A matrix, H1 subtype, H3 subtype, H5 subtype), Influenza B (Parainfluenza 1,2,3, and 4), Metapneumovirus (hMPV), HAdV, Entero-Rhinovirus, Corona NL63, Corona HKU1, Corona 229E, Corona OC43, and Bocavirus is possible. Bacteriophage MS2 and bacteriophage \u03bb DNA were used as the internal controls. The detection of respiratory virus targets using the xTAG RVP, which detects 20 respiratory viral targets, was compared with individual qPCR nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) (Pabbaraju et al., 2008) . The xTAG RVP can detect all the respiratory viral targets included in the in-house NAT panel, which is used for detection of Influenza A, B viruses (IFVA, IFVB), parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4 (PIV 1-4), RSV, hMPV, and respiratory adenovirus types (ADV). Of the 1,530 samples tested, 532 were positive by xTAG RVP and 580 by in-house NATs for these targets. This gives the xTAG RVP a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 99.7%; in addition, xTAG RVP can detect picornaviruses (the in-house assays did not detect 88 picornaviruses) and coronaviruses and can subtype IFVA positives simultaneously. The xTAG RVP includes all the respiratory viral targets that are tested routinely for the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections; further, the technology is flexible and can easily allow for incorporation of other targets (e.g., human bocavirus) in the future.",

Acute viral gastroenteritis is usually caused by four distinct families of viruses: rotaviruses, noroviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses (Liu Y. et al., 2012) . The authors focused on simultaneous detection of rotavirus A (RVA), noroviruses (NoVs), sapoviruses (SaV), human astrovirus (HAstV), enteric adenoviruses (EAds) and human bocavirus 2 (HBoV2). Altogether 140 fecal samples were tested using the MBMNA and RT-PCR in parallel. The specificity of MBMNA was equal to the conventional RT-PCR (>90%), but MBMNA was faster in terms of detection of different viral pathogens in one tube (Liu Y. et al., 2012) . The studies of (Hamza et al., 2014) were also directed to the detection of human enteric viruses (human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), enterovirus (EV), rotavirus (RoV), norovirus GI (NoVGI), and norovirus GII (NoVGII), but environmental water samples were tested (Hamza et al., 2014) . MBMNA provided high specificity and no cross-reactivity, but was not as sensitive as qPCR for the identification of viral contamination in river water samples. In contrast, all wastewater samples that were positive in qPCR were also positive by the MBMNA and the detection limit was higher than qPCR; MBMNA was as sensitive as qPCR for viral detection in wastewater samples. Therefore, MBMNA could be a reliable method for the simultaneous detection of viral pathogens, but only in wastewater. For detection of gastrointestinal pathogens xTAG R Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel -GPP is commercially available [multiplex detection of various viral, bacterial and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool samples (Beckmann et al., 2014; Perry et al., 2014; Wessels et al., 2014; Zboromyrska et al., 2014) ].

Subsequent analysis of the data showed that the 26-plex method precisely discriminated all 18 high-risk HPV targets and also 8 low-risk HPV targets. Another study focused on genotyping HPV also used specific probes targeting a region of the L1 gene (Zubach et al., 2012) . DDH was optimized for the detection and genotyping of 46 mucosal HPV types, which are associated with infections of the genital, anal, and oropharyngeal mucosae and the method enables a more comprehensive coverage of HPV types compared with the previously mentioned study, where only 26 types of HPV were genotyped. The DDH was more sensitive than the Linear Array (a leading commercial genotyping method) in terms of distinguishing positive/negative HPV samples, but less sensitive for detection of multiple HPV types; another limitation was the inability of the PCR system to amplify certain variants of HPV68. HPV genotype detection was by combined whole genome amplification and xMAP technology showed that this method is highly specific and sensitive (Lowe et al., 2010) . This approach is capable to identify all high risk HPV types with the analytical limit of detection 100 copies plasmid DNA.",

MBMI was also compared with a Western blot assay for the detection of HIVspecific antibodies (Kong et al., 2016) . The microspheres were coupled with anti-p24 monoclonal antibody and with HIV antigens: gp41, p17, p24, p31, and p66 recombinant protein. The results of both methods showed that MBMI sensitivity was 82.7% and Western blot assay sensitivity was 74.7%. The MBMI was more efficient and precise for screening several parameters and based on the acquired results it was better in HIV diagnostics than Western blots. For the determination of antibodies against HCV in patient serum samples MBMI based on the antigenic properties of four recombinant proteins was designed . Only a small number of samples was tested and that is why the specificity and sensitivity were 100%, but in spite of this the MBMI has the potential to become a viable alternative to standard tests due to its excellent specificity and it may be used for screening of HCV infection. Detection of antibodies against several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (NPC) showed the possibility of simultaneous detection of multiple markers using MBMI, which is not possible with ELISA, and because of the distinct EBV serology spectrum in individual NPC patients, the multiplexed microsphere assay has powerful potential to allow serological diagnosis of NPC in the future (Gu et al., 2008) . MBMI showed increased sensitivity and the possibility of quantifying antibodies, antigens, as well as other substances (e.g., hormones, cytokines, tumor markers, etc.), in contrast to conventional ELISA tests (duPont et al., 2005) .",

However, there were some limitations to the method, which included the limited number of clinically significant pathogens or the inability to detect diarrheagenic E. coli, protozoa, or viruses. The full capacity of the DDH assay was utilized when the panel was expanded to include the most common bacterial/viral enteropathogens found in stool samples, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas, Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII and astrovirus (Onori et al., 2014) . The results showed that the assay is rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable for screening and for exploring the etiology of gastrointestinal infections. The sensitivity of MBMNA was demonstrated to be greater than the routine methods (76.3% versus 66.5%), with the exception of Salmonella sp. and toxigenic C. difficile where the adoption of multiplex PCR did not always result in a significant improvement of specificity. The causative agents were not found in 44 of 245 (18%) of the presumed infectious gastroenteritis cases, but this could be due to the limitations of the detection panel, which did not include allelespecific probes for detection of parasitic enteric pathogens or emerging viruses related to gastroenteritis. Also, using DDH, detection of pathogenic bacteria occurring in environmental samples and causing acute and often fatal diseases (Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella melitensis) was optimized in a multiplexed format to allow the maximum sensitivity and specificity (Wilson et al., 2005) . DNA was extracted robotically and in combination with DDH a rapid reliable screening approach was developed. Detection limits were from 100 fg to 10 pg starting DNA concentration when primer sets were multiplexed; in some cases the limits of detection were higher when primer sets were tested separately (range from 10 fg to 10 pg).",

Samples with discordant results between the routine tests and xTAG GPP were tested by singleplex PCR and sequencing. The overall sensitivity of xTAG GPP was 96.3% and specificity was 99.8%.

However, the authors also reported some disadvantages as xTAG GPP failed to detect some important diarrheal pathogens (Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) often detected by routine diagnostic tests; further, the detection of Salmonella exhibited low sensitivity (84.9%).",

The main advantage over direct hybridization methods is the ability to simultaneously detect diverse signatures such as unique sequences, SNPs, indels and repeats (Song et al., 2010) . MOL-PCR was initially optimized for the detection of the biothreat agents Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis . The pathogen-specific sets of MOLigo pair probes were designed and their specificity and sensitivity were tested using similar species of Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis and dilutions of isolated DNA, respectively. MOLigo pairs, which showed the highest specificity and sensitivity, were selected for compilation of a final probe panel, which was validated on extracted DNA from infected rodent liver and spleen, human blood or pleural fluid spiked with pathogen DNA. Nine from 10 unknown samples were successfully identified using the final probe panel. The results also showed the ability of this method to simultaneously detect multiple different signatures (SNPs, indels and repeats). The versatility of MOL-PCR was utilized when simultaneous detection of Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis was supplemented by characterization of antibiotic resistance (ciprofloxacin and doxycycline) of these bacteria based on SNP analysis (Song et al., 2010) . The allelespecific probes for detection and characterization of all the known resistance determinants performed well when tested individually, but multiplex use did not provide satisfactory results. Due to the ability to simultaneously detect diverse signatures such as unique sequences, SNPs, indels, and repeats, MOL-PCR can be used as a genotyping method as described below. A MOL-PCR-based 8plex SNP typing method for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) based on two phylogenetically equivalent sets of SNP markers that are specific for the six main human-associated lineages of MTBC was introduced (Stucki et al., 2012) . MOL-PCR was compared with TaqMan qPCR and the obtained results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of both methods were similar (specificity 100%, sensitivity 98.6% MOL-PCR, 98.8% TaqMan) and that both methods were of comparative cost. MOL-PCR was ideal for classification of unknown isolates, while TaqMan qPCR was faster for confirmation of unknown isolates. MOL-PCR was also successfully used for genotyping of Bacillus anthracis in a 13-plex assay to score 13 phylogenetically lineagespecific canonical SNPs within the genome of Bacillus anthracis (Thierry et al., 2013) .",

In MBMI direct fluorescence (detection antibody that incorporates a fluorescent label) is used for detection of reaction or of emerging product in contrast to ELISA and, in addition, MBMI enables measurement of multiple analytes simultaneously. For this reason, MBMI is preferred because time for detection is reduced and also test sensitivity is increased (Jun et al., 2012) . Capture sandwich immunoassays (CS) were successfully applied for detection of organism-specific antibodies using microspheres coupled with antibodies for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Listeria and it has been demonstrated that MBMI is a suitable method for multiplex detection of bacteria occurring in foodstuffs or for detection of Brucella sp. from milk using capturesensitive monoclonal antibodies for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen of Brucella sp. (Silbereisen et al., 2015) . MBMI was also applied to test bacterial contamination of foods through the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) , staphylococcal toxin A (SEA), and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) produced by various strains of Staphylococcus aureus (Simonova et al., 2014) using sandwich immunoassays in which microspheres were conjugated with specific antibodies. A similar approach was used for the detection of pneumococcal serotype-specific polysaccharide and C-polysaccharide (C-Ps) antigens from urine samples (Sheppard et al., 2011) . For the detection, MBMI was combined with the Binax NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection kit. The specificity of MBMI was determined by testing 85 serotypes of S. pneumoniae and other strains of streptococci; 18 of the 26 non-pneumococcal serotypes gave C-P positive results, which showed that MBMI could be used for diagnosis of infection caused by S. pneumoniae only in combination with the Binax NOW assay.",

Parasitic agents may pass from animals to humans in several ways, e.g., by direct contact, vector, consumption of raw or undercooked foodstuffs containing the infective stages or by infective stages released into environment (Hubalek, 2003) . In the context of animal health and human food consumption, a list of the top ten parasites has been defined by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) ( Table 3) . Although in the last decades a number of novel diagnostic methodological approaches has been developed, the current diagnosis of some parasitic diseases is still based only on a combination of clinical signs, anamnesis, and direct visual identification of parasitological objects (Anderson et al., 2015) . The most common conventional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination, biochemical assays or ELISA, are available, but they are laborious, time-consuming and in many cases not reliable (Navidad et al., 2013) . Improvements in this field are represented by molecular methods, including also routine PCR diagnostics, increasingly used for detection mainly of intestinal parasites, which are easy to recover from fecal specimens (Taniuchi et al., 2011) or potentially useful for other parasites found in secretions. With regard to the fact that parasites might exhibit very strictly confined localization within the host's bodyintracellular/extracellular or tissue/organ, sampling can be very problematic and it often leads to a false negative results.",

            "text": "Outbreaks of diarrheal diseases are caused by a wide range of pathogens, including parasites. Stool microscopy (detection of eggs, parts of bodies etc.) is the gold standard in the diagnostics of intestinal parasites. However, the presence of parasites in stool may vary and could be naturally low, requiring multiple sampling. In fact, up to 80% of all cases of diarrhea remain without confirmed etiology (Vernacchio et al., 2006) . Therefore, there is space for the development of more sensitive diagnostic assays (Taniuchi et al., 2011) , which should provide more precise determination. Among the modern molecular diagnostic methods qPCR assays are most frequently used for determination of intestinal parasites. In areas where co-infections are common (up to 22% of cases are caused by two or more pathogens) (Jansen et al., 2008; Friesema et al., 2012) , the application of multiplex assays is of great benefit. Several pioneering works have been published in relation to this topic. To date, in parasitology, improved multiplex qPCR assays were adapted to DDH, which enables parallel diagnosis of seven intestinal parasites (Taniuchi et al., 2011) ; separate reactions were optimized -3plex for protozoa (Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica) and 4-plex for helminths (Ancylostoma duodenale, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, and Strongyloides stercoralis). The final calculated sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 100%. The results of both DDH assays were equivalent or better in comparison to the parent multiplex qPCR. Moreover, this approach has been developed as a commercial diagnostic xTAG GPP tool-a 19-plex assay, which enables inter alia detection of the protozoa G. intestinalis, E. histolytica and Cryptosporidium sp. The overall performance of xTAG GPP compared with conventional methods (standard culture, microscopic examination, immunochromatographic tests, qPCR) showed a sensitivity of 94.5% (range 90 to 97%) and a specificity of 99% (range 98,5% to 99,9%) (Claas et al., 2013; Mengelle et al., 2013; Navidad et al., 2013) . If multiplexing more than 20 targets, the limit of detection might be reduced for individual targets when compared to single-target detection (Navidad et al., 2013) . However, the identification of multiple pathogens revealed that very often (in up to 65% of samples), the physicians do not request testing for the proper pathogen (Claas et al., 2013) . Therefore, multiplexing refines the diagnosis and contributes to the selection of a suitable treatment. It was mentioned above that microsphere-based assays can be arranged also as multiplex indirect immunoassays, although the conventional singleplex ELISA still represents the gold standard in serodiagnostics for screening of individual human/animal or higher numbers of samples at a population level (Ruitenberg et al., 1983; Nockler et al., 2000; Dubey et al., 2005) . Recently, some studies have been done in order to improve the potential of this serological method and to upgrade it to the multiplex level. These studies are mostly focused on parasites with the ability to migrate through the tissues of the host's body -where PCR based detection would not be reliable. In this context, the most studied group of parasites are representatives from the phylum Nematoda, including also the important human pathogens, the Trichinella sp. The larvae may infect humans during the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat, mainly pork (domestic pig, wild boar) and can induce disease, whose consequences can be fatal (Dupouy-Camet, 2000; Pozio and Murrell, 2006) . Inspection of meat for the most important species, Trichinella spiralis, is mandatory at slaughter (Anonymous, 2015) , but currently used methods like artificial digestion and microscopic examination of pooled meat samples (Nockler et al., 2000) are archaic and usually do not properly reflect the real infection. Therefore, serodiagnostic methods are considered as a possible alternative and xMAP technology in the form of ISA, using excretory/secretory (E/S) products, was also developed and tested. The effectivity of ISA was tested with T. spiralis-positive pig meat samples. The system was developed as a duplex assay (with Toxoplasma gondii), using goat anti-swine secondary antibodies against specific antibodies. The results of this study corresponded to the infection status of the animals with an assay sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 100% (Bokken et al., 2012) . When the immunoglobulin binding protein A/G (generic Ig-binding protein), which can be used in multiple species in contrast with goat anti-swine secondary antibody, was included, the results showed a similar specificity of 95%, but an increase in sensitivity from 88% for anti-swine antibody to 94% with protein A/G. The xMAP technology-ISA exhibited 87% sensitivity and 95% specificity in comparison with the commercial Pourquier ELISA, and 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity in comparison with the Safepath ELISA (van der Wal et al., 2013) .",

The infection by these parasites is typically peroral at areas contaminated by embryonated roundworm eggs, e.g., sand from childrens' playgrounds. The recombinant T.canis and T. cati E/S antigens Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-TES-26 were used to detect toxocara-specific antibodies in sera from humans pre-diagnosed as positive for visceral and ocular larval migrans (VLM, OLM). The specificity of ISA was 94% for both sets of samples, but there were differences in the sensitivity, which was 99% for VLM and 64% for OLM samples. It was recorded that a combination of recombinant antigens improves sensitivity in comparison with conventional immunoassays (e.g., Western Blot, ELISA), which employ native E/S antigens isolated from larvae (limited availability) that also exhibit cross-reactivity with antibodies from other helminthic infections so reducing its usefulness in regions with poly-parasitism.",

Six haploid genotypic groups within these pathogens can be distinguished by several molecular methods e.g. PCR fingerprinting or intergenic spacer genotyping. Besides these haploid groups, hybrids have been described as well. AD hybrids are hybrids between the two varieties of C. neoformans and also hybrids between C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. gattii have been described.

The results showed that DDH is highly specific method and it is possible not only identify cryptococcal isolates at the species and genotype levels but also allows identification of hybrid isolates that have two alleles of the specific probes region and also able to identify cryptococci in cerebrospinal fluid.

The multiplex assays for the detection and typing of pathogens using xMAP technology are tools of choice as they are capable of providing all of the important information within a reasonable timeframe, and without excessive labor or costs. The major improvement of xMAP assays is that they add another dimension to the simple detection, which is represented by the simultaneous analysis of many targets within a single sample, and they therefore represent complementary tools to procedures for the detection and quantification of pathogens such as qPCR, culture, or ELISA assays. The significance of such a complex approach for the multiplex detection has grown in recent years, which is documented by the increase in published data and of application of the commercial assays in routine diagnostics.",
