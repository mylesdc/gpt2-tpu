We did not find a significant difference among the three MEM-E based media with regard to luminescence (data not shown). However, cytopathic effect (CPE) was more evident in cells grown and infected with WNV in MEM-E than in DMEM. The signal from the virus control with DMEM showed a higher luminescence signal than that with MEM-E while the luminescence from cell controls was identical ( Figure 1A ). The MEM-E media also shortened the assay incubation period by two days compared to DMEM media and hence was chosen for the HTS.",

As a result, we identified SRI-19093 with an inhibitory effect on the protease and with IC 50 of 0.42 \u00b5M, suggesting the molecular target of these two compounds may be the NS3pro of WNV (Figure 4 ). We also tested N-phenylanthranilic acid for NS3pro inhibitory activity as this moiety was common for two compounds, SRI-19093 and SMR000171908, but we could not detect any significant activity in this system (data not shown).

The endpoint we developed and employed in the HT screen was CPE caused by viral replication, which has advantages over other target based HTS. A CPE based antiviral screen is expected to elucidate a wider range of antiviral compounds than other target based assays. A CPE based assay is likely to discover cytotoxic compounds since the cytotoxic compounds will decrease the endpoint signal and are read as inactive. This has an advantage over reporter-based assays in that they can read false positives. In fact, we found only 14 compounds with CC 50 less than 30 \u00b5M among 110 compounds subjected to the dose response assay. The pathway for probe discovery is depicted in Figure 7 . The top 110 compounds, based on their inhibitory activities were examined by a dose response and cytotoxicity assay. Twenty-four compounds showing a dose response inhibition were further evaluated in a time of addition assay and in a titer reduction assay. Finally, seven compounds are presented as anti-WNV probes. Hit rate for the secondary assay and the final confirmation were 0.185% (24 compounds out of 13,001 compounds) and 0.053% (7 out of 13,001 compounds) respectively.",

A well with a luminescence signal less than the mean of the non-infected control signal, minus 5 times the standard deviation of the control, was regarded as a positive infection. The TCID 50 was calculated with the numbers of positive infection and negative infection by the Reed-Muench method [26] .",

As a result of HTS and secondary assays, we have identified 7 compounds as specific and effective anti-WNV probes. Further optimization of these compounds is needed to develop effective antiviral treatment for WNV infection. In addition, the compounds we have identified should serve as novel molecular probes to help us understand the biology of WNV. Future studies will focus on how these compounds target virus replication and the mechanism of action. In conclusion, identification of previously known and novel moieties from a screening library is proof that the WNV assay is an effective HT screen.",
