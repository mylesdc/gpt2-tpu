To date, no antiviral or vaccine is available for this common viral infection. Immunomodulators could represent an interesting strategy for the treatment of severe viral infection. Recently, the role of protease-activated receptors (PAR) in inflammation, coagulation and infection processes has been of growing interest. Herein, the effects of a PAR1 agonist and a PAR1 antagonist on hMPV infection were investigated in BALB/c mice. Intranasal administration of the PAR1 agonist resulted in increased weight loss and mortality of infected mice. Conversely, the PAR1 antagonist was beneficial to hMPV infection by decreasing weight loss and clinical signs and by significantly reducing pulmonary inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (including IL-6, KC and MCP-1) and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs. In addition, a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titers was also observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. Despite no apparent direct effect on virus replication during in vitro experiments, an important role for PAR1 in the regulation of furin expression in the lungs was shown for the first time. Further experiments indicated that the hMPV fusion protein can be cleaved by furin thus suggesting that PAR1 could have an effect on viral infectivity in addition to its immunomodulatory properties. Thus, inhibition of PAR1 by selected antagonists could represent an interesting strategy for decreasing the severity of paramyxovirus infections.",

Limited reports in humans [3, 7, 8] and extensive studies in animals [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] have shown that severe hMPV infection is associated with the disruption of the epithelial architecture and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates around and within alveoli. Among the diverse small animal models that have been evaluated, BALB/c mice have emerged as an excellent model for recapitulating hMPV infection, including efficient viral replication in the lungs, concomitant pulmonary inflammation and airway obstruction as well as disease severity that correlates with increasing viral inoculums [10, [14] [15] [16] . BALB/c mouse studies have also shown that the immune response to hMPV infection can be both disproportionate and inefficient, characterized by a weak innate response and a Th2-biased adaptive immune response, leading to impaired virus clearance and prolonged pulmonary inflammation [10, [14] [15] [16] .",

Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue licensed for treatment of severe human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infections, exhibits moderate in vitro activity against hMPV and was found to be beneficial in the mouse model [18, 19] . Indeed, this antiviral has been used to treat a few severe cases of hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals [20] [21] [22] . The mechanisms of action of ribavirin do not appear to be limited to the disruption of the viral purin metabolism and inhibition of viral RNA polymerase. It has been shown that this drug could also upregulate IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3 and downregulate Th2 cytokines such as IL-10 in vitro, suggesting an immunomodulatory as well as an antiviral effect [23] . However, ribavirin is associated with many side-effects and teratogenicity [24] , which limits its widespread use. Thus, the development of new antivirals and/or immunomodulatory strategies is warranted for the treatment of severe hMPV infections.",

            "text": "Secretory serine proteases have long been known to play an important role in several physiological processes such as hemostasis (primary hemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis) and immune responses to infection [25] . Increasing interactions between these two systems are being discovered, including during viral infection [26] . Serine proteases of the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin, are able to activate complement components [27, 28] and to regulate cell function through the activation of a family of G-protein coupled receptors called protease-activated receptors (PAR) [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . PARs have a unique mechanism of activation in which irreversible proteolytic cleavage within the extracellular N-terminus of the receptor exposes a new N-terminal sequence that acts as a tethered ligand. The latter interacts with the second extracellular loop of the receptor, hereby activating the receptor [30, 34, 35] . Four PARs have been characterized until now (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3 and PAR4). They are all activated by thrombin except PAR2 for which the main activating protease is trypsin [30, 35] . PAR1 in particular is a ubiquitous receptor present in platelets, endothelial and epithelial cells, neurons, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes and tumor cell lines [30] . PAR1 is a receptor involved in many physiological processes including the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems as well as in embryogenesis, cancer and inflammation [35] . In fact, some PAR1 antagonists are currently in clinical trials for their antiplatelet activities [36, 37] . The role of PAR1 in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases has recently been investigated for a number of pathogens including feline immunodeficiency virus [38] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [39] , dengue virus [40] , herpes simplex virus [41, 42] and influenza A virus [43, 44] . For the latter pathogen, upregulation of PAR1 was observed in the airways of mice infected with the highly pathogenic influenza A/PR-8/34 (H1N1) virus [43] . Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PAR1 could also play an important role in modulating the immune response during severe hMPV infection. Therefore, we treated hMPVinfected BALB/c mice with either a selective PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH 2 ) or a PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) and then evaluated disease severity. We observed that PAR1 activation increased weight loss and decreased survival in our hMPV mouse model. In contrast, administration of a PAR1 antagonist decreases disease severity and significantly reduced lung cytokines and inflammation in BALB/c mice. The protective effect of the PAR1 antagonist could also be explained by a decrease in furin-mediated cleavage of the viral fusion (F) protein.",

No toxicity was observed using concentrations up to 250 \u00b5M of the PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH 2 ). Using concentrations of up to 0.8 \u00b5M for the antagonist and 250 \u00b5M for the agonist, no antiviral effect was observed. In a second experiment, hMPV was pre-incubated with the compounds (maximum concentration of 0.8 \u00b5M) before addition to LLC-MK2 monolayers. No antiviral effect was again observed when the compounds were removed and replaced by fresh medium after the adsorption phase or when the compounds were replenished daily throughout the experiment (not shown).",

PAR1 agonist-or PAR1 antagonist-treatment of uninfected mice did not induce weight loss, mortality or any signs of toxicity (data not shown). Mortality was only observed in PAR1-agonist treated mice (17% on day 6 post infection (pi) and 50% on day 7 pi for mice treated with 50 \u00b5M and 500 \u00b5M of PAR1 agonist, respectively). These groups also had a greater weight loss compared to infected, vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 1A ). Conversely, weight loss was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in PAR1 antagonist-treated mice compared to the infected, vehicle-treated group ( Figure 1B ). No significant difference in pulmonary viral titers was observed between PAR1 agonisttreated mice and vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, viral titers in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated mice by about 1 log ( Figure 1C ). Thus, we conclude that PAR1 plays a deleterious role in the pathogenesis of hMPV infections.",

The minimal cleavage site is RXXR\u2193, exhibiting a P1 and P4 Arg residues [46] . In order to tentatively investigate the possible mechanism by which PAR1 compounds can influence viral replication, we analyzed furin transcripts in the lungs of hMPVinfected animals by RT-PCR. PAR1 compounds were administered for 5 days at a dose of 500 \u00b5M, starting at the time of infection, and lungs were harvested on day 5 pi. HMPV infection resulted in a significant increase in furin transcripts (by 38%) in mouse lungs compared to uninfected mice (Fig. 4A ). Treatment of infected mice with the PAR1 agonist did not significantly alter furin expression. However, treatment of infected mice with the PAR1 antagonist significantly reduced furin transcript levels (by 18%) compared to hMPV-infected/ untreated mice. Using a pIRES vector expressing each proprotein convertase, we previously showed a similar expression of each convertase and their ability to cleave selected substrates [47, 48] . Thus, we used these same constructs to show that furin was the only tested proprotein convertase that was able to cleave the hMPV fusion precursor protein into its active form ( Figure 4B ) in two cell lines (COS-1 and HEK293). We then investigated the effect of PAR1 on the cleavage of the hMPV fusion precursor protein ( Figure 4C ) in this in vitro cleavage assay. Treatment of F protein/furin cotransfected HEK293 cells with either the PAR1 agonist or antagonist did not alter F cleavage (43.7 and 41.2% cleavage, respectively, compared to 36.8%). However, co-transfection of cells with cDNA encoding the F protein, furin as well as recombinant human PAR1 (rhPAR1) reduced F cleavage from 36.8% to 12.4%. When these rhPAR1 expressing cotransfected cells were treated with the PAR1 antagonist, F protein cleavage remained low (12.0%), whereas PAR1 agonist treatment restored F protein cleavage to the basal level observed in cells without rhPAR1 expression (38.2%), confirming a role for PAR1 in the cleavage of the hMPV fusion protein.",

Conversely, an antagonist of PAR1 (SCH79797) prevents clinical signs and reduces lung inflammation and viral titers, when administered at the time of viral infection. The reduction in lung viral titers by the PAR1 antagonist was probably not due to a direct antiviral effect but was more likely mediated through a reduction in furin expression and/or activity and viral infectivity.",

To further investigate the PAR1 agonist specificity, we examined its well-known effect on intestinal permeability [55] in wild-type and PAR1-knockout mice. To this end, 51 Cr-EDTA was infused in the colon of the mice and the effect of the PAR1 agonist on the passage of 51 Cr-EDTA to the blood, reflecting intestinal permeability was measured ( Figure  S1A ). As expected, mice treated with the PAR1 agonist peptide TFLLR displayed enhanced intestinal permeability, compared to saline control treated mice. In marked contrast, mouse treatment with the RLLFT inactive control peptide had no effect on permeability, arguing against potential nonspecific effects of the agonist. More importantly, the effect of the agonist on increased intestinal permeability was abolished in PAR1deficient mice. Altogether, these results show that the agonist specifically activates PAR1 in mice. Furthermore, this agonist peptide has been also used to specifically activate PAR1 in mice elsewhere [56] [57] [58] . Subsequently, we also investigated whether the PAR1 antagonist was capable of blocking the specific PAR1 signaling in vivo. We found that antagonist treatment prevented increased intestinal permeability associated with administration of the PAR1 agonist peptide to wild-type mice ( Figure S1B) . Thus, the effect of the antagonist is likely related to its ability to specifically block PAR1 in vivo. Furthermore, the antagonist has also been used to block PAR1 activation in rodent models elsewhere [56, [58] [59] [60] .",

Most strikingly, when treatment was started simultaneously with hMPV-infection and was continued for 5 days, no weight loss or clinical signs were observed ( Figure 2 ). Evaluation of pulmonary inflammation and viral titers was performed on day 5 pi, the time point at which both parameters peak in untreated hMPV-infected mice [10] . During this acute phase of infection, pulmonary inflammation mostly consists of interstitial, perivascular and alveolar inflammation and all these parameters were significantly reduced by treatment with the PAR1 antagonist. In line with this observation, we also showed a significant reduction in the levels of key cytokines/chemokines that are usually increased in hMPV infection (including IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES) [10] . Some of these cytokines namely IL-6, IL-8 (the human equivalent of murine KC) and MCP-1 have been previously shown to be up-regulated by PAR1 activation or down-regulated by PAR1 inhibition in non-infected human respiratory epithelial cells in models of asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [61] [62] [63] [64] . Furthermore, SCH79797 significantly reduced MCP-1 expression in M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected cells in vitro [39] . Finally, Khoufache et al. recently demonstrated that SCH79797 treatment of influenza A-infected mice also significantly reduced IL-6, KC and RANTES levels in broncho-alveolar lavages [44] .",

Mice were sacrificed on day 5 pi, lungs were removed and snap frozen. RNA was extracted and furin transcript levels were determined using RT-PCR. Significant differences in furin transcript levels were observed between treated and untreated mice based on a Student T-test (* p=0.05, ** p<0.01) B) COS-1 and HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the hMPV F protein containing a V5-tag and a plasmid encoding one of the proprotein convertases. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using a V5 mAb. Furin is the only convertase capable of cleaving the full length precursor protein (F0) into its activated form, resulting in the shorter C-terminal subunit (F1). C) Recombinant human PAR1 and furin are co-tranfected with the hMPV F protein containing a V5-tag in HEK293 cells with/without hPAR1 agonist, (100 \u03bcM) or antagonist (0.1 \u03bcM).

However, the PAR1 antagonist treatment significantly reduced the recruitment of lung macrophages (Figure 3 ). PAR1 is expressed on both human and murine dendritic cells and its activation induces the release of MCP-1, IL-10, and IL-12 from these cells [65] . Moreover, PAR1 signaling on dendritic cells has been shown to sustain a lethal LPS-induced inflammatory response in mice [66] . In our study, we also observed a significant reduction in dendritic cells present in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice compared to untreated hMPV-infected mice. Activation of PAR1 on human T cells induces the secretion of IL-6 [67] and may have an effect on T cell receptor signaling [68] . In addition, T cell migration to the liver of PAR1-deficient mice was reduced by 70% in a model of liver fibrosis, suggesting a role for PAR1 in T cell migration [69] . We did not observe a significant difference in CD4 + T lymphocytes between any of the groups, yet significantly less CD4 -T-lymphocytes were found in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. It remains to be confirmed, however, whether these CD4 -lymphocytes represent cytolytic T lymphocytes.",

In fact, as was the case in the first 5-day experiment, the weight of SCH79797-treated mice remained similar to that of uninfected mice and no reduced activity or ruffled fur were observed. Treatment with either antagonist also reduced mortality induced by hMPV infections. Compared to 33% mortality rate for the untreated group, only 17% and 0% mortality rates were observed for the SCH530348-and SCH79797-treated groups, respectively.

            "text": "Immunomodulation, as a therapy, offers several advantages over conventional antiviral strategies. Because the host is the target of such a therapy, immunomodulation avoids the selective pressure on the pathogen that leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, because of the non-specific nature of the innate immune system, its modulation could result in broad-spectrum protection against a wide range of microbial pathogens. The use of immunomodulators for viral infections has been most extensively investigated for chronic infections such as HIV and viral hepatitis infections and some of these agents like interferon are in clinical use [70] . With the advent of severe respiratory distress syndromes due to A/H5N1 avian influenza and SARS-coronavirus infections and in particular since the 2009 influenza pandemic, the interest for immunomodulators in acute viral infections has been increasing. Several antiinflammatory therapies for influenza A infections have been evaluated so far, including sphingosine analogues, NF-\u03baB inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, COX-2 inhibitors and macrolides [71] [72] [73] . The latter are antibiotics with known antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that have shown promising results in several viral respiratory infections caused by influenza A, rhinovirus and hRSV [74] . Like macrolides, PAR1 antagonists may have a broad spectrum of activity. Indeed, Khoufache et al. recently reported results similar to ours in murine models of influenza A infections including those caused by A/H5N1 and oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) pdm09 strains [44] . In addition, unpublished data from our group indicates that PAR1 antagonists can significantly decrease hRSV lung titers and key pulmonary cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES) in a similar mouse model highlighting the broad-spectrum potential of these compounds.",

This observation suggests a direct or indirect effect of PAR1 on viral replication. Such direct antiviral effect was not observed in our in vitro cell culture experiments, although testing was limited by cytotoxicity so that we cannot completely rule out a direct antiviral effect. On the other hand, viral entry into the host cell is mediated by the hMPV F surface glycoprotein. This protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein that requires proteolytic cleavage to become active [75] . The cleavage motif of the HMPV F protein at RSQR\u2193FV contains a minimal furin cleavage site, i.e., RXXR\u2193 present in many of its in vivo substrates [76, 77] . Even though cleavage of the HMPV F protein requires the addition of trypsin in vitro, other enzymes could be involved in activating the F protein in vivo. Indeed, we found furin expression levels to be significantly increased in the lungs of hMPV-infected mice compared to mock-infected mice. In addition, using an in vitro cleavage assay, we clearly showed for the first time that, of all tested proprotein convertases, only furin was capable of cleaving the hMPV F precursor protein.",

Since activation of PAR1 quickly initiates the internalization and degradation of the receptor [78] we hypothesize that the presence of unactivated PAR1 at the cell surface inhibits furinmediated F protein cleavage. These in vitro observations could, at least partly, explain the slight reduction in viral titers observed in the lungs of hMPV-infected, PAR1 antagonisttreated mice. Considering that endogenous activators of PAR1 are present during in vivo infection, the inhibition of PAR1 activation with the PAR1 antagonist and the subsequent inhibition of PAR1 internalization and degradation could lead to reduced F cleavage and could therefore contribute to decreased hMPV infectivity. Taken together, these data suggest that furin levels and/or activity could have an effect on hMPV infectivity. On a similar note, PAR1 antagonists have been shown to decrease the plasmin-mediated cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin protein with subsequent reduction in mouse lung viral titers [44] . Although PAR1 modulation of furin levels and/or activity and their subsequent effect on viral infectivity could offer a possible explanation for the reduced viral titers observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice, it needs to be confirmed that PAR1 inhibition can reduce the infectivity of other hMPV strains as well. Of interest, replication of several paramyxoviruses is furin-dependent, and this immunomodulatory approach may thus be beneficial not only for hMPV, but for other paramyxovirus infections as well.",

Different PAR1 antagonists appear to confer different protection levels during hMPV infection, warranting the evaluation of other PAR1 inhibitors and, importantly, the assessment of delayed treatment on clinical outcome.

Mice were treated intranasally with 50 or 500 \u03bcM of PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH 2 ) or antagonists (SCH79797 and SCH530348) or with equivalent dilutions of H 2 O or DMSO depending on the compounds. Animals were housed in groups of three to five in micro-isolator cages. The animals were evaluated on a daily basis for weight loss and the presence of clinical signs such as reduced activity and ruffled fur. The humane endpoint was determined at 20% weight loss in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Animal Protection Committee of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec. On day 5 pi, six mice per group were euthanized using sodium pentobarbital and lungs were removed for the evaluation of viral titers by cell culture, cytokine levels using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay, histopathological changes using hematoxylin-eosin staining, cell recruitment by flow cytometry, and furin expression levels by quantitative RT-PCR.",

In a first protocol, after a 12 h fast, under light halothane anaesthesia, a polyethylene catheter was inserted intra-rectally to 3 to 4 cm from the anus. A single administration of TFLLR-NH2 (200 \u00b5g/mouse each) or RLLFT-NH2 (200 \u00b5g/mouse each) was performed into the distal colon through the catheter, in a volume of 100 \u00b5l.
