In developing countries, laboratory methods to identify bacterial pathogens are more difficult to implement, because of the lack of appropriate facilities and material in hospital laboratories and then, long transit times are prejudicial for stability of specimens. In our study the transit time was reduced because of the proximity of the CENHOSOA and the IPM. Unfortunately, our findings for the rate of bacterial infection may be artificially low due to prior antibiotic use.

However, little information is available about the causes of childhood pneumonia in developing countries. In our study, only 3% of the patients died; this value is low. Note that the study population consists of patients from families with a socioeconomic level that is above the average for the general population in Madagascar. The patients who died were more frequently co-infected and under 6 months old. These results are consistent with other studies on this topic in developing countries [35, 36] . However, study design may have an impact on the mortality rate observed: indeed all fees for hospitalisation were paid by the study to allow follow-up to be optimised.",
