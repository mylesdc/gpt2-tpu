However, the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not appear to be directly responsible for promoting the fusion of the gamete membranes, suggesting that this critical phase of the fertilization cascade requires the concerted action of alternative fusogenic machinery. It has therefore been proposed that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in the organization and/or stabilization of higher-order heteromeric complexes in spermatozoa that are required for membrane fusion.",

At least two of these complexes contain IZUMO1 in partnership with GLI pathogenesis-related 1 like 1 (GLIPR1L1). This interaction is associated with lipid rafts and is dynamically remodeled upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis in preparation for sperm adhesion to the oolemma. Accordingly, the selective ablation of GLIPR1L1 leads to compromised sperm function characterized by a reduced ability to undergo the acrosome reaction and a failure of IZUMO1 redistribution. Conclusions: Collectively, this study characterizes multimeric protein complexes on the sperm surface and identifies GLIPRL1L1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of IZUMO1 function and the fertilization process.",

            "text": "Mammalian fertilization is underpinned by a number of sequential interactions between sperm and oocytes that culminate in a complex process of membrane adhesion and fusion [1] . The understanding of the molecular basis of gamete interactions has been advanced by an elegant series of transgenic and biochemical studies focusing on the sperm protein IZUMO1, and its oolemmal binding partner, IZUMO1R (sperm-egg fusion protein Juno) [2] . IZUMO1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein [3] that localizes to both the inner and outer acrosomal membranes of spermatozoa before undergoing dynamic relocalization to the cell surface upon completion of an acrosome reaction [4] . From this latter position, IZUMO1 directs gamete recognition and adhesion via multiple low-affinity interactions with IZU-MO1R, a GPI-linked receptor that resides on the surface of the oolemma [5] . The indispensable nature of this interaction has been confirmed through complementary in vitro antibody inhibition and in vivo knockout studies targeting Izumo1 and Izumo1r, all of which effectively block the fertilization cascade at the level of gamete adhesion/fusion [2] . Bianchi and colleagues [6] have, however, shown that the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not directly promote membrane fusion. Indeed, while the ectopic expression of IZUMO1R in HEK293 cells is successful in promoting their adhesion, it fails to induce the formation of syncytia among these cells [6, 7] . Similarly, cultured cells expressing mouse IZUMO1 can bind to oocytes, but fail to fuse with them [8] [9] [10] . Such findings are seemingly at odds with the demonstration that sperm from Izumo1 null males are capable of binding to but not fusing with the oolemma [3] .",

Thus, in addition to its direct binding to IZUMO1R, it has been suggested that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in gamete fusion by virtue of its ability to organize and/or stabilize fusogenic proteins within the sperm membrane [12] . Alternatively, and as explored herein, IZUMO1 may be associated with other key regulators of sperm receptor organization and fusion. Such models of gamete fusion share analogy with the mechanisms that underpin membrane fusion in many other biological systems where the concerted action of multiprotein complexes is a wellestablished paradigm. For instance, it is widely accepted that a majority of enveloped viruses use protein complexes to regulate their progression through the sequential phases of fusion with a suitable target cell membrane, i.e., receptor recognition, triggering of fusion, and fusion execution [13, 14] . The complexity of this membrane fusion machinery ranges from the use of multiple copies of a single glycoprotein for the entire fusion reaction [15] , through to the segregation of the activities responsible for membrane attachment and membrane fusion into different proteins and separate multimeric complexes [16] .",

The existence of unique pools of IZUMO1 complexes is further supported by the demonstration that different IZUMO1 antibodies localize the protein either exclusively within the equatorial segment [17] or, alternatively, on the entire/anterior acrosomal region of acrosome-reacted sperm [3, 11] .

To validate these findings, IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 antibodies were used to probe extracts of mouse spermatozoa under reducing and native conditions. Consistent with our previous work [21] , under reducing conditions, the GLIPR1L1 antibody bound to a predominant band with a molecular weight of 37 kDa, while the IZUMO1 antibody bound to a protein with a mass of~56 kDa (Fig. 1b) . Further, immunoblot analysis of native sperm lysates with these antibodies revealed strong binding with several very high molecular weight protein bands, raising the possibility that both IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 associate with additional sperm proteins to form multimeric complexes (Fig. 1c) . Specifically, probing with IZUMO1 antibodies labeled at least six protein bands of~150-750 kDa, supporting previous work that IZUMO1 associates with other proteins to form multimeric complexes on the surface of mouse spermatozoa [11] . GLIPR1L1 was detected in association with six predominant complexes of~200-1000 kDa. The number of complexes recognized by both antibodies did not appear to change between non-capacitated, capacitated, or capacitated and A23187-treated sperm, although quantitative changes were observed wherein there appeared to be some loss of each complex in the latter sample. Importantly, both IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 were localized with a band consistent with oolemmal protein-binding complex I (~750 kDa). They also colocalized to complex IV (Fig. 1a , c, complexes I and IV, marked in red arrowheads). Given that the combined molecular weight of IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 is, however, below that of complexes I and IV, it is likely that they contain additional components that were not identified in our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.",

Both proteins displayed a similar diffuse labeling of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Fig. 4a , b) but were clearly represented in the head of mature spermatozoa where they were primarily localized to the periacrosomal region. Consistent with our previous findings [21] , additional GLIPR1L1 labeling was detected in a discrete spot at the posterior aspect of the sperm head corresponding to the connecting piece (Fig. 4c) . Following the induction of the acrosome reaction, detected by (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 Identification of mouse sperm multimeric protein complexes with affinity for homologous oolemmal proteins. a Mouse spermatozoa were purified under non-capacitating (Non-Cap) or capacitating (Cap) conditions. A portion of the latter population was also challenged with A23187 to induce the acrosome reaction (AR). To detect native protein complexes with affinity for oolemmal proteins, far-western blotting with biotinlabeled preparations of oocyte lysates (Far-Western) was undertaken. Four predominant oolemmal protein-binding complexes (arrowheads, I-IV) were identified. Each experiment was replicated a minimum of three times and representative gels and blots are shown. The numbers on the left correspond to the molecular weight (kDa) of native PAGE protein standards. b Validation of GLIPR1L1 and IZUMO1 antibodies. The specificity of the antibodies used in this study was confirmed by immunoblotting against sperm protein extracts. This experiment was replicated three times and immunoblots are shown. The numbers on the left correspond to the molecular weight of the protein standards. c Identification of mouse sperm protein complexes comprising IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1. Populations of non-capacitated (Non-Cap), capacitated (Cap), and acrosome-reacted (AR) mouse spermatozoa were solubilized in blue native lysis buffer. The extracted proteins were resolved on BN-PAGE gels before being prepared for immunoblotting with either IZUMO1 or GLIPR1L1 antibodies. Arrowheads indicate the predominant complexes recognized by each antibody. Red arrowheads correspond to complexes (I and IV) that co-migrated with those that bound oolemmal proteins (see Fig. 1a ). Each experiment was replicated a minimum of three times and representative images are shown. The numbers on the left correspond to the molecular weight (kDa) of native PAGE protein standards (Fig. 4d) , although the overall intensity of GLIPR1L1 labeling was diminished within acrosomereacted spermatozoa. In order to assess the topology of interactions, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed. Despite similar immunocytochemical labeling patterns, the use of PLA revealed that IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 complexes were not universally distributed through the cytoplasm of developing pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Fig. 5a) . Rather, a relatively large number of discrete foci of colocalization were observed, few of which were present in the developing acrosomal domain. Unexpectedly, PLA staining for the complex was virtually absent in epididymal spermatozoa before re-emerging within the head of > 90% of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa (Fig. 5b, c) . Importantly, a suite of controls utilizing antibodies against proteins that should not interact with IZUMO1, such as acrosin and \u03b1tubulin, as well as single antibody only controls, failed to demonstrate the presence of any fluorescent signals (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) indicating that the interaction observed between IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 was specific. Collectively, these results confirm that IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 form a protein complex within male germ cells, but that this assemblage is influenced by the maturation status of the cell.",

The rationale for this experiment is strengthened by previous independent evidence that IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 are components of mouse [23] and bovine [24] sperm lipid rafts, respectively. Consistent with the hypothesis, both proteins displayed strong colocalization with G M1 gangliosides in the periacrosomal region of the head of capacitated spermatozoa (Fig. 6 ). Consistent with previous data, upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis, G M1 became more widely distributed throughout the anterior region of the sperm head ( Fig. 6 ).

Similarly, no significant differences were seen in the number of pups per litter, body weight, testis weight, or daily sperm production between genotypes (Additional file 3: Figure S3A -C, Fig. 8b ). Sperm motility was assessed using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer, revealing no significant differences in total or progressive motility and other sperm velocity parameters between genotypes ( Fig. 8c-e) . Similarly, sperm appeared to capacitate normally as assessed by the time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in capacitation permissive media (Fig. 8f , Additional file 4: Figure S4 ). By contrast, sperm from Glipr1l1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had a significantly reduced ability to undergo the progesterone-induced acrosome reaction compared to wild type (54% in WT, 17% in knockout sperm, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 8g) .

Acrosome-reacted mouse spermatozoa were subjected to immunoprecipitation using IZUMO1 or GLIPR1L1 antibodies as described in the \"Methods\" section. Membranes were probed with the target antibody, to confirm the efficacy of immunoprecipitation, before being stripped and re-probed with the alterative antibody to confirm the target protein interaction. Whole sperm lysate was included to confirm the identity of the co-precipitated proteins, as was the material recovered after washing the beads to confirm the specificity of the elution. This experiment was replicated three times and representative blots are depicted localization. No significant difference was observed between IZUMO1 localization in acrosome intact WT and Glipr1l1 \u2212/\u2212 sperm (Fig. 10a) . The relocation of IZUMO1 following the acrosome reaction was, however, qualitatively and quantitatively severely attenuated in Glipr1l1 \u2212/\u2212 sperm (Fig. 10b) . Specifically, in WT sperm following the acrosome reaction, IZUMO1 was relocated throughout the sperm head in 85% of sperm, compared to 21% of acrosome-reacted Glipr1l1 \u2212/\u2212 sperm (P < 0.0001). Collectively, these data reveal that GLIPR1L1 has a role in optimizing acrosome function, the translocation of IZUMO1 during the acrosome reaction, and the fertilization process.",

            "text": "In previous studies, we have isolated biologically active, native protein complexes from mouse and human spermatozoa and demonstrated that several of these multimeric entities possess affinity for homologous zona pellucidae [25, 26] . Herein, we have extended the analysis to focus on complexes that are present in acrosome-reacted mouse spermatozoa, which may participate in downstream interactions with the oolemma. These studies revealed that sperm do indeed possess multimeric protein complexes with the potential to adhere to solubilized oolemmal proteins. Furthermore, in agreement with independent data [11] , we were able to identify the sperm adhesion molecule, IZUMO1, as a key constituent of some, but not all, of these complexes. IZUMO1 has been the subject of intense interest since it was identified as being essential for fertilization [2, 3, 27, 28] . Interestingly, the protein lacks a fusogenic domain and properties commensurate with those expected of a membrane fusion-inducing molecule. Additionally, while the ectopic expression of IZUMO1, or its complementary oolemmal receptor IZUMO1R, in model cell lines is sufficient to support their adhesion, it fails to promote cell fusion [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Taken together, these data raise the prospect that IZUMO1 may either bind other receptor(s) or it may bind to other ancillary proteins with roles involved in oolemma adhesion and fusion. The data presented here indicated that GLIPR1L1 is one such protein and that it is required for optimal fertilization. The latter model is analogous with the concerted action of the multimeric fusogenic complexes that have been implicated in membrane fusion events as diverse as viral envelope and synaptic vesicle fusion [14, [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

            "text": "In regard to potential IZUMO1-interacting proteins in spermatozoa, we identified GLIPR1L1 as a key candidate in at least two high molecular weight complexes. Mouse GLIPR1L1 has a testis-enriched expression profile and undergoes extensive post-translational modifications during spermatogenesis before becoming localized to the post-acrosomal region and connecting piece of elongated spermatids and spermatozoa [21] . GLIPR1L1 is also present on the plasma membrane of at least rat, bovine, and macaque sperm and depending on species, variably anchored by a GPI linkage within lipid rafts within the membrane [24, 33] . In the bovine, GLIPR1L1 surface association appears to result from the uptake of this protein from the microvesicles that spermatozoa encounter during their maturation in the epididymis [34] . By contrast, the mouse GLIPR1L1 orthologue is acquired during spermatogenesis. It does not contain a consensus GPI anchor site and cannot be released from the sperm surface by GPI-specific phospholipase C [21] , confirming that the mechanism of GLIPR1L1 association with the sperm surface varies between species. Nevertheless, as an interesting example of evolutionary divergence in the means by which a protein becomes localized to an orthologous domain within sperm, our data suggest that mouse GLIPR1L1 spermatids were purified and sequentially labeled with IZUMO1 or GLIPR1L1 and appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (green) followed by Alexa Fluor 594conjugated PNA (red). Labeling was also conducted on capacitated spermatozoa that were either c acrosome intact or d acrosome reacted. This experiment was replicated three times, and representative images are shown. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm does partition into lipid rafts on the surface of sperm; a finding that is of importance owing to the ability of rafts to serve as platforms for the assembly of multimeric complexes that coordinate a variety of specialized functions, including fertilization [22] . While we have yet to definitively demonstrate that lipid rafts facilitate the formation and/or repositioning of GLIPR1L1-IZUMO1 complexes in mouse spermatozoa, it is noteworthy that IZUMO1 has also been independently identified as a constituent of mouse sperm lipid rafts [17, 35] .",

            "text": "GLIPR1L1 is a member of the CAP superfamily which has putative roles in processes as diverse as carcinogenesis, immune tolerance, and potentially cell adhesion [20] . Of note, several additional members of the CAP family play roles in mammalian male fertility, including roles in spermatogenesis, epididymal sperm maturation, and potentially at the site of fertilization [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, despite previous findings implicating GLIPR1L1 in sperm binding to the zona pellucida in both mouse and bovine models [21, 24] , we noted only a relatively modest, non-statistically significant reduction in the ability of Glipr1l1 \u2212/\u2212 spermatozoa to participate in this cellular interaction. These data raise the prospect that deficits in sperm-zona pellucida adhesion may, at least in part, be attributed to GLIPR1L1 antibodies eliciting non-specific steric hindrance and/or masking of zona pellucida receptors. While the precise molecular function of GLIPR1L1 therefore remains to be established, data from other CAP proteins supports a putative fusogenic role and indicates that this role is most likely associated with the evolutionarily conserved CAP domain at the N-terminal half of the protein [20, 40] ; potentially involving the first 101 amino acids, which have been implicated previously in cell-cell adhesion [41] . Consistent with this hypothesis, the ability of GLIPR1L1 to regulate the acrosome reaction, an event in which the plasma membrane and outer acrosomal membranes fuse, is analogous to the membrane fusion processes required at the time of fertilization. Our data is also consistent with the identification of the sea squirt sperm plasma Fig. 5 Co-localization of IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 in developing mouse germ cells using an in situ proximity ligation assay. a The cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue) and PNA (green). This experiment was replicated three times, and representative images are shown. b In the case of capacitated spermatozoa, a lower magnification image is also included to highlight the differences in PLA labeling between acrosome intact and acrosome-reacted (arrowhead) spermatozoa. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm. c The percentage of cells displaying PLA positive labeling was recorded. Each experiment was replicated three times and the data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. *P < 0.05, compared with spermatocytes. Individual data points for each replicate are provided in Additional file 6: Raw data membrane CAP proteins, HrUrabin and CiUrabin, as sperm receptors for the vitelline coat in two species of these marine invertebrates [42, 43] , and with the ability of the mammalian CAPs, CRISP1, CRISP2, and CRISP4, to promote acrosome exocytosis in the mouse. The latter also raises the possibility that CAP domains, from a number of individual proteins, may act redundantly in acrosome function and/or fertilization [36] [37] [38] 40] .",

            "text": "While the data demonstrates a role for GLIPR1L1 in the translocation of IZUMO1 to the post-acrosomal region prior to fertilization, the lack of co-complex formation, as illustrated by the PLA data, does not support that the IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 remain in association within \"the\" IZUMO1-containing sperm-oocyte receptor. Specifically, sperm fusion to the oocyte is known to occur at the equatorial segment. By contrast, IZUMO1-GLIPR1L1 complexes are localized within the postacrosomal region. The possibility remains however that the binding and movement of IZUMO1 with GLIPR1L1 during the acrosome reaction acts to spatially restrain and coordinate both sperm binding to the oocytes and fusion between their membranes. Importantly, the findings within this paper support the notion that the complexes we describe contain additional, as yet unidentified constituents. They also suggest that such complexes are dynamically remodeled as part of the mechanism that primes spermatozoa for their adhesion and fusion of the oolemma. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the acrosome reaction promotes extensive remodeling of the sperm architecture and culminates in the exposure of a novel set of surface proteins [12] . Although we have yet to determine how the repositioning of IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 is achieved, our data show that the movement of IZUMO1 is dependent on GLIPR1L1 function. These data also suggest that the sub-fertility observed in Glipr1l1 knockout male mice is, at least in part, due to the restrained distribution of IZUMO1 in knockout mice.",

            "text": "As an important caveat, however, despite compromising the in vitro fertilization potential of spermatozoa, the disruption of Glipr1l1 expression failed to elicit an equivalent suppression of the fertility of Glipr1l1 null males following natural mating. Indeed, Glipr1l1 knockout males sired litters of equivalent size to that of WT control males, indicating that GLIPR1L1 is not essential for male fertility. Such findings mirror those of previous studies in which numerous gene-manipulated mouse models have been shown to retain normal fertility despite the selective ablation of sperm proteins that were originally proposed as essential for fertilization based on in vitro experiments (reviewed in [44, 45] ). In seeking to reconcile this apparent dichotomy, it is conceivable that knockout mice experience a genetic compensation response whereby the transcription of gene(s) related to the inactivated target is upregulated [46, 47] . Alternatively, it is possible that spermatozoa harbor multiple intrinsic oocyte receptors that work synergistically and thus impart some level of functional redundancy to key aspects of the fertilization cascade [48] . Thus, while subtle defects in sperm function may result in sub-optimal fertilization rates in an in vitro setting, these do not necessarily directly translate to reduced fertilization in vivo. Alternatively, it is possible that differences exist in the mechanistic basis by which agonists, such as the steroidal hormone progesterone, stimulate acrosomal exocytosis versus that of the physiological stimuli sperm encounter upon interaction with the oocyte vestments [49] . In any case, we noted that~17% of the spermatozoa from Glipr1l1 knockout males retained their ability to undergo an acrosome reaction (compared to 54% WT spermatozoa), thus contributing a sufficient population of fertilization-competent spermatozoa to achieve normal rates of fertilization after natural mating.

For the oocyte receptor complex identification, adult male mice (> 8 weeks old) were euthanized, and their epididymides and testes were removed and dissected free of fat and overlying connective tissue. Caudal spermatozoa were collected by backflushing [51] after which the perfusate was deposited into modified Biggers, Whitten, and Whittingham media (BWW [52] ;) or Modified Tyrode 6 media (MT6 [53] ;). Where indicated, negative control (non-capacitated) incubations were conducted using non-capacitation medium prepared without NaHCO 3 but with additional NaCl incorporated to maintain an osmolarity of 300 mOsm/kg. The formation of bicarbonate in these samples was prevented by capping the tubes throughout the incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 : 95% air. Positive control (capacitated) incubations were conducted in media supplemented with 1 mM pentoxifylline (ptx) and 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP). These treatments have been demonstrated to suppress and promote sperm capacitation, respectively, the latter being defined by tyrosine phosphorylation, hyperactivation, and zona binding [54] .",

Briefly, Glipr1l1 was modified at exon 1 (ENSMUSE00000640359) by the guide RNA (gRNA) sequence: forward-TCCTAGGGTGCCAACTATCA and reverse-TGATAGTGCCTAGGCTTTAA, which includes the scaffolding required to form a complex with the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. The resulting Cas9/ gRNA complex bound to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and cleaved the double-stranded DNA three nucleotides upstream of the PAM site leaving blunt ends. This break in the DNA stimulated an imprecise nonhomologous end joining repair which resulted in a 7-bp (ACTATCA) deletion in exon 1 of the Glipr1l1 gene. This resulted in a truncated mRNA containing exon 1, which encoded the first 39 N-terminal amino acids of the GLIPR1L1 protein (Additional file 2: Figure S2A -B). Gene ablation was assessed using qPCR and immunohistochemistry as outlined below.",

For IVF, cumulus-oocyte complexes collected from super-ovulated females were placed in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Merck) under mineral oil at 37\u00b0C for 15-30 min. A sample of 2 \u00d7 10 5 capacitated sperm from each male were incubated with a separate clutch of cumulus-oocyte complexes. Gametes were left to achieve fertilization for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Potential zygotes were then washed three times in HTF medium and transferred to a drop of pre-warmed potassium-supplemented simplex optimized medium (KSOM) to mature to the two-cell stage overnight. Successful fertilization was assessed 24 h post-fertilization by counting the percentage of twocell embryos relative to total oocytes used. For the zona binding assay, cumulus-oocyte complexes isolated as above were treated with hyaluronidase for 1 min to remove cumulus cells and stored in high salt storage medium at 4\u00b0C until use [68] . After three washes in PBS, salt stored oocytes were transferred to BWW medium and co-incubated with a sample of 2 \u00d7 10 5 capacitated sperm for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Oocytes were washed in PBS and transferred to slides to count the number of sperm bound. A total of 4-8 oocytes were used per replicate.",
