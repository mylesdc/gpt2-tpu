Swine influenza is generally characterized by acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms. The most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this work was to study the acute phase proteins (APP) responses after coinfection of piglets with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SwH1N1) and Pasteurella multocida (Pm) in order to identify whether the individual APP response correlate with disease severity and whether APP could be used as markers of the health status of coinfected pigs.",

The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) increased significantly at 1 dpi as compared to control pigs, and remained significantly higher to 3 dpi. Level of serum amyloid A (SAA) was significantly higher from 2 to 3 dpi. Haptoglobin (Hp) was significantly elevated from 3 dpi to the end of study, while pig major acute phase protein (Pig-MAP) from 3 to 7 dpi.

These pathogens may act together to increase the severity and duration of the disease. In pigs, as well as in humans, bacterial pneumonia secondary to influenza is often observed [8] and SIV is an important contributor to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). The bacterial pathogens associated with PRDC are classified as primary or secondary pathogens, and Pm plays a key role as a secondary invader [9] . Up to now the kinetics of acute phase response after experimental infection of pigs with SIV or Pm alone have been investigated [3, 4, 10, 11] . Exposure to multiple pathogens may result in different kinetics of APP response, as compare to monoinfection with SIV or Pm.",

As it have been found by Barb\u00e9 et al. [11] , during SIV infection IL-6 concentration in piglets' serum peaked from 24 to 30 h post infection. At later time-points post infection, the concentration of this cytokine was either >20-fold lower or at the limit of detection. The serum levels of other cytokines stimulating production of APP by hepatocytes (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1) were under the limit of detection. Rapid disappearance of IL-6 from serum could also explain a fast drop in APP concentrations during to the preinoculation levels in only SIV infected piglets [4] . Studies conducted on mice reveled that after Pm infection concentration of cytokines involved in regulation of APP production by hepatocytes increased at later time-points post infection [22] .

Our results did not confirm this finding, but we found the significant positive correlation between maximum serum Pig-MAP concentration and degree of turbinate atrophy (turbinate score). It should be mentioned that the timing of sampling must be taken into consideration as it may be critical in showing a precise correlation, as was reported previously by Francisco et al. [10] . Moreover, we found positive relationships between maximal concentration of Hp and SAA in serum and lung scores. The significant positive correlation found between maximum concentrations of SAA in serum and lung scores were also reported previously in pigs infected with H1N2 swine influenza virus [16] . Similarly, positive correlation between Hp and SAA concentration in pigs' serum at the day of necropsy and changes in the lungs were reported after Pm infection [3] . Furthermore, the positive association between concentration of SAA and clinical score were found in present study.

Exposure to multiple pathogens resulted in the strongest CRP, Hp and SAA response as compared to mono-infection with SIV or Pm [3, 4] . Additional studies need to be done in order to confirm these findings with regard to other coinfections. Present result also confirm our previous findings that SAA could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies (e.g. vaccine efficiency investigations) or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity (lung scores, clinical scores).",
