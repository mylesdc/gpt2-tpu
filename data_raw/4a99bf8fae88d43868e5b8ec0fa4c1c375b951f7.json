While public stigma is the reaction that the general population has to the individuals who are considered different, self-stigma occurs when \"people with devalued status who internalize the discriminatory beliefs and experience diminished selfesteem and self-efficacy\". 7 Corrigan suggested that both public stigma and self-stigma comprise three components: stereotype (negative belief about the group/self), prejudice (agreement with belief and/or negative emotional reaction) and discrimination (behaviour response to prejudice). 8 Self-stigma has further been explained by the cognitiveaffective-behavioural model. 9 According to the model, the stigmatized individuals perceive their stigmatized identity as a burden and taint of their life, which lead to negative sense of self (self-stigmatizing cognitions). Such conceptions might lead to a myriad of negative affective responses, encompassing feelings of anger, fear and shame (selfstigmatizing affect) which, in turn, resulting in identity concealment, social avoidance and self-denigration (self-stigmatizing behaviours).",

            "text": "Despite the continuous intervention efforts in combating HIV stigma, public stigma towards PLHIV remains ubiquitous across the globe. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, public stigma towards HIV/ AIDS is the greatest compared to genital herpes, hepatitis, drug abuse and cancer. 10 The high level of stigma towards PLHIV can be due to several causes. First, a high level of self-responsibility is attached to HIV as the acquisition of HIV is due to behaviours that can be preventable, such as unsafe sex and needle sharing. 11, 12 Some behaviours associated with HIV, such as same-sex behaviours, are also considered immoral and are thus condemned by the society. 5 Misconceptions about HIV transmission routes and overestimation of the perceived contagiousness and risks through casual contact further evoke stigmatization towards HIV. 12 These cause an intensive level of blame and disapproval against PLHIV, resulting in social rejection, discrimination and prejudice. 13, 14 It is contended that stigma against PLHIV is even more intense in the Chinese context, as the behaviours related to HIV infection, such as same-sex behaviours, multiple sex partnership and injecting drug use, are generally perceived as defying acceptable social norms and culture. [15] [16] [17] High level of ignorance, misconception and fear of HIV also contribute to the high level of stigma towards PLHIV in the Chinese context. 18, 19 Furthermore, face concern, which refers to social image and social worth that are garnered based on one's performance in an interpersonal context, is particularly important in the Chinese society. 20, 21 Yang and Kleinman 22 proposed that while the concept of \"face\" represents social power, capital and a person's value in society, PLHIV experiences loss of face as a result of violation to cultural norms, which greatly affects their access to social capital and closely parallels how stigma works in Chinese society. In Hong Kong, studies have documented a high level of unfavourable attitudes and stigmatizing behaviours towards PLHIV. For example, a population-based study among Hong Kong adults reported that nearly half of them exhibited discriminatory attitudes towards PLHIV. 23 A comparative study on the public's attitude towards different types of infectious diseases have shown that the level of public stigma towards HIV was the highest compared to other infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis (TB). 24 PLHIV are also disadvantaged in terms of economic and social opportunities. For example, a local study reported that 20% of the studied companies would dismiss an employee if he or she was HIV+, and only a few companies indicated that they would provide counselling and support to an HIV+ employee. 25 Comparative study on employer attitudes towards PLHIV in Beijing, Hong Kong and Chicago revealed the trend of reluctance to hire PLHIV are most pronounced among employers from Beijing and Hong Kong. 26 Study among PLHIV in Hong Kong has also shown that over 50% felt that they were discriminated in different settings such as in the workplace and in social relationships. 27 HIV stigma poses a significant impediment to public health across the globe and a key obstacle to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support. 28, 29 It is noticeable that many PLHIV have internalized the negative labels attached to them and experienced a high level of selfstigma. In one study among 322 PLHIV in China, 78% of them had the feeling of negative worth and 58% of them were unwilling to disclose their HIV status. 30 It is also reported that the level of internalized stigma was similar between PLHIV diagnosed less than 1 year ago and more than 1 year, indicating that level of self-stigma did not reduce across time. 31 Self-stigma is significantly associated with various negative outcomes such as worse psychosocial well-being, 32 showed that attribution of perceived controllability of the disease, personal responsibility to the cause of the illness and self-blame was significantly associated with higher levels of self-stigma. 45, 46 However, one local study looking at factors associated with self-stigmatization using the attribution model for PLHIV, including self-blame, responsibility for contacting HIV and internal controllability for contracting HIV, showed that although attributions of control predicted attributions of responsibility which, in turn, predicted self-blame, the linkage between self-blame and self-stigma was not significant. 47 Other factors have also been proposed. Recent studies in adults living with HIV have found that optimism predicts lower levels of HIV-related stigma indirectly through increasing psychological well-being 32 and also that personal meaning predicts lower level of HIV-related stigma indirectly through increasing social support. 48 These mechanisms have not been explored in the local context. Furthermore, mass media has often been used to shape public attitudes and knowledge about HIV. It has been suggested that Chinese individuals are more likely to obtain HIV information from mass media than from interpersonal sources. 49 A content analysis of articles about HIV published in Chinese newspapers over a decade revealed that individuals who contracted HIV through socially unacceptable means were devalued as non-descript members of a deviant and dangerous group. 50 However, from our understanding, how mass media might lead to self-stigma among PLHIV in the Chinese context has not been examined.",

Our findings suggest that many participants have shown feelings of shame and guilt as they considered themselves responsible for the infection. As most of the participants acquired HIV through heterosexual contact with sex workers or homosexual contact with men, it is conceivable that participants demonstrated an internal attribution of the disease and thus reporting negative feelings of shame and guilt and a high level of self-stigmatization.",

Given the potential adverse consequences of HIV stigma, exploring the factors associated with stigma is important to understanding and ameliorating stigma among PLHIV. To date, most of the studies on stigma have focused on how self-stigma might affect health and relatively little attention has been paid to the factors which may contribute to the perception of stigma among PLHIV. Studies of other health conditions indicated that the way people attribute their disease may influence their internalization of stigma.

Similarly participants were self-selected, and it might be possible that those who chose to participate had a more positive view towards themselves. In addition,the background characteristics of the participants varied greatly in the present study, it might be possible that those with different length of diagnosis, or sexual orientation might have different experiences of stigma. Finally, participants were asked to share their experiences and examples of stigmatization in general, and no attempt has been made to compare their level of stigmatization between different points of time; therefore, there was no information on whether participants' level of stigmatization has improved over time. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of the study. The present study described and identified the stigmatizing experiences and possible factors that may lead to stigmatization of PLHIV in Hong Kong. Findings suggest that misconceptions about HIV, together with physical symptoms, attribution of personal responsibility of disease, discrimination and social rejection, and the negative stereotypes of HIV endorsed by the society all contributed to intensifying the level of stigma among PLHIV in Hong Kong.",

The negative connotations carried by HIV are consistent with a local study that a sizeable proportion of the respondents hold negative perceptions about PLHIV.23 Such misrepresentation of HIV tend to be partly due to the inaccurate and biased information presented by the media in the early 1990s, which framed HIV negatively as a dead pyramid, indicating that HIV was a fatal illness with no treatment available. Despite that fact that the disease has been transformed into chronic illness in the post-HAART era, the message has not been well disseminated to the public. The negative perceptions and stereotypes endorsed by the society might intensify the beliefs of PLHIV that they are inferior and should be blamed and stigmatized by the society.Results support the extant literature that public and self-stigma are inextricably associated,56 and PLHIV may be at risk for internalizing the society's negative views towards themselves and holding a stigmatizing views towards themselves as a result.HIV-related stigma has long been regarded as a hindrance to public health effort in controlling HIV, therefore interventions reducing stigma among PLHIV are highly warranted. Our findings suggest various ways in which HIV stigma could be reduced. First, the present findings reveal that misconceptions about HIV could intensity stigmatization; therefore, there is a need for both PLHIV and the public to be better educated about HIV and this should be given the highest priority in HIV stigma reduction. Local studies have revealed that misconceptions about HIV in Hong Kong fall particularly on its mode of transmission and mortality rate.23 Therefore, education in these two particular areas of HIV should be introduced in both clinic and community settings. Other studies also suggest that interventions designed to address negative self-image or stigma of HIV could include a variety of modes such as individual or counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, social support and empowerment.57,58 In particular, family of the PLHIV and health-care professionals should also be targeted in interventions as the present study shows that discrimination and social rejections also originated from them. There has been evidence that community-based HIV stigma reduction programme was effective to help family members gain a richer understanding of HIV stigma, ways to cope with it and ways to be more supportive to PLHIV.59 To reduce HIV stigma in the health-care setting, interventions must focus on the individual, environmental and policy levels.60",
