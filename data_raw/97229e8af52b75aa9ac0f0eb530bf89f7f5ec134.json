By evaluating the inhibitory effects of compounds in our library, we identified inhibitors of cyclophilin A (CypA), a known immunosuppressor with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, can significantly attenuate EV71 proliferation. We demonstrated that CypA played an essential role in EV71 entry and that the RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous CypA expression led to decreased EV71 multiplication. We further revealed that CypA directly interacted with and modified the conformation of H-I loop of the VP1 protein in EV71 capsid, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry step in a pH-dependent manner. Our results aid in the understanding of how host factors influence EV71 life cycle and provide new potential targets for developing antiviral agents against EV71 infection.",

Cyps possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and have high affinity for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA). Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a key member of the Cyp family and was first shown to mediate the immunosuppressive function of CsA through the formation of a CsA-CypA complex. This complex binds to and inhibits the function of the phosphatase calcineurin, which normally functions to dephosphorylate NF-AT, a transcription factor important for T cell activation [1] .",

CypA was first shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions through its interaction with the capsid protein (CA), and the interaction between newly synthesized HIV-1 CA and CypA is required for HIV-1 to induce dendritic cell maturation [4, 5] . CypA also interacts with other HIV-1 proteins, such as Vpr and p6, to regulate HIV infection [6, 7] . CypA was further revealed to interact with extracellular CD147, which is the main receptor for CypA on the cell membrane of human leukocytes, and this interaction can induce the phosphorylation of HIV-1 matrix protein to regulate the liberation of the reverse transcriptase complex into cytoplasm during an early stage of HIV-1 infection or can function in HIV-1 attachment to host cells [8] . But a recent research showed that CypA stabilized the HIV-1 capsid and antagonizes HIV-1 uncoating in vitro, indicating the versatile roles of CypA in HIV-1 infection [9] . Moreover, several lines of evidences revealed that Cyps play crucial roles in HCV life cycle. CypB was first reported to be important for HCV replication [10] , but later studies showed that CypA, but not CypB, was required for HCV infection in vitro [11] [12] [13] [14] . CypA was reported to function in the replication of HCV by increasing the affinity of the HCV polymerase NS5B for viral RNA to enhance HCV replication [13] , or by binding to the HCV NS5A protein to aid in viral replication [15, 16] . Furthermore, Cyps were demonstrated to play an essential role in HPV infection by facilitating conformational changes in capsid proteins of HPV, resulting in exposure of the Nterminus of L2 protein, and the dissociation of L1 pentamers from recombinant HPV11 L1/L2 complexes in a pH-dependent manner [3, 17] .",

            "text": "Enterovirus-71 (EV71), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in pan Asia-Pacific region and results over eight millions of infections and three thousands of dead cases since 2008 [18, 19] . The genome of EV71 contains a single-stranded, positivesense RNA (+ssRNA) and encodes a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximate 250 kDa [20] . This polyprotein is initially processed into one structural (P1) and two non-structural (P2 and P3) regions and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage into various precursors, ultimately resulting in 11 mature proteins. Among them, P1 is further proteolyzed into VP1 to VP4 to form the viral capsid, while P2 and P3 are processed into replicase proteins. For a productive infection, virions must uncoat and release viral genome into host cytoplasm, following the successful bindings with functional receptors. Enteroviral uncoating process involves sequential capsid alterations by conformational changes [21] . During uncoating, mature particles with sediment coefficient of 160S are converted to the uncoating intermediate A particles with sediment coefficient of 135S, and subsequent empty 80S particles representing the final production of the entry process [22] . The 80S particles are empty particles that have shed genomic RNA, whereas the 135S particles retain the full complement of genomic RNA but lack some or all of their content of VP4 and have externalized most of the N-terminal extension of VP1 that is normally inside the virions [22] .",

Only two extracellular membrane proteins, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) [23] and scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2) [24, 25] , as well as heparan sulfate (HS) [26] , were recently identified as functional receptors for EV71 infection. Another result suggests that the binding of EV71 to human annexin II on the cell surface enhanced viral entry and infectivity, especially at a low infective dose [27] . Interestingly, SCARB2 was reported to be the exclusive uncoating receptor to trigger conversion of 160S particles to other forms during uncoating process at acidic condition, resulting in the releasing of viral genome [21] . Here we used CypA inhibitors as bioprobes to show that CypA played an essential role in EV71 proliferation. We also elucidated the mechanism by which CypA interacted with and modified the conformation of EV71 VP1 H-I loop, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry. This CypA-EV71 capsid functional association not only provides information to understand the cellular factors used in EV71 infection, but also presents a new promising potential for the development of antiviral therapeutics.",

Unlike other Enterovirus (e.g. coxsackievirus), EV71 could cause severe aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and acute flaccid paralysis, thus leading to high fatality rates. There is no clinically applied therapeutics. In this work, we used CypA inhibitors as bioprobes to show that CypA played an essential role in EV71 proliferation. We also elucidated the mechanism by which CypA interacted with the EV71 VP1 H-I loop and functioned as an uncoating regulator in EV71 entry step. Since there are several non-immunosuppressive CypA inhibitors, e.g. NIM-811 and Debio-025, have been reported to show antiviral potency, our results provide a potential way to discover clinical therapeutics against EV71 infection.",

By using a GST-tagged CypA as a probe (Fig. 3A) , we demonstrated that recombinant CypA protein was clearly bound to wt-EV71, and the interaction of CypA with the EV71 virion was increased by substituting with a proline residue at VP1-S243 (Fig. 3B, upper panel) . However, when we replaced both S243 and P246 with alanine residues, the mutated virus, i.e., S243A/P246A-EV71, cannot bind with CypA (Fig. 3B, bottom panel) . This interaction between CypA and the EV71 virion was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treating with CsA and can almost be abolished at a concentration of 4 mM CsA (Fig. 3C, upper panel) . Additionally, the S243P mutant rescued the interaction between CypA and EV71 under CsA treatment (Fig. 3C, bottom panel) . We further demonstrated that recombinant CypA protein not only bound to wt-EV71 strain AnHui1 but also to other strains of the wt-EV71 virus (Fig. 3D) .",

A similar attenuation of the interaction between the CypA H126Q mutant and virions was also reported in HIV-1 and HCV [12, 34] .

The results showed that the inhibition of EV71 by HL051001P2 represented a clear dependence on the treatment time. The HL051001P2 treatments at 26 to 0 hpi showed the inhibition of EV71 replication, whereas the anti-EV71 effect of the treatments after 2 hpi was significantly attenuated (Fig. 4A) . We further transfected an EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA lacking the P1 region in the RD-sh-control and RD-sh-CypA cells and found that the EV71 RNA replication inside the host cells was not affected by the downregulation of CypA (Fig. 4B ).

When we detected EV71 VP1 expression, we found that VP1 expression can be clearly and consistently attenuated in EV71-infected RD-sh-CypA cells in comparison with EV71-infected RD-sh-control cells from 10 hpi (Fig. 4E) . Moreover, the augmentation of EV71 virus RNA in RD-sh-control cells indicated that the replication of EV71 RNA began at 4 hpi (Fig. 4C , black line); by contrast, this stage was obviously delayed to 8 hpi in the RD-sh-CypA cells (Fig. 4C , red line). However, when we infected RD or RD-sh-CypA cells with S243P-EV71, the growth curves revealed a similar curve, indicating that the VP1-S243P mutant confers resistance to CypA depletion (Fig. 4D ). When we checked the viral titers in the culture, we found that the viral titers in the supernatant were not clearly altered in EV71-infected RD-sh-CypA and RD-sh-control cells (Fig. 4F) . We also infected RD cells by using wt-EV71 with a 5 mM HL051001P2 treatment and measured the viral titers in the supernatant at different hpis (Fig. 4A) . The results showed that infectious viral production was affected by the inhibitor at -6, -4 and -2 hpi, but not as significantly as the impact on the intracellular viral genome at the same hpi. We thus speculated that CypA depletion blocked viral entry during re-infection and left more viruses in the culture.",

To demonstrate the exact function of CypA in EV71 entry, we first checked the effect of CypA downregulation in the binding of EV71 virions to host cells. The results showed that EV71 binding to host cells was attenuated by CypA knockdown (Fig. 5A ) and could be rescued by the substitution of S243 with a proline residue (from 50% attenuation to 90% attenuation) (Fig. 5B) . We then checked the binding affinity of three reported EV71 functional receptors, i.e., SCARB2, PSGL-1 and HS, for the wt-EV71 virions without or with CypA treatment. The results revealed that CypA treatment did not lead to obvious upregulation in the binding with EV71 functional receptors (Figs. 5C-5E). Together with the result showing that CypA directly interacts with the EV71 virion, the CypA treatment is not likely to enhance the binding to all reported receptors, and the attenuation of EV71 virions that are binding to RD-sh-CypA and compensation by S243P mutation are likely to resulted in an interaction change between the virions and CypA located at the cell membrane. The data for the EV71 genome were expressed as the percentage of EV71 RNA from the untreated control cells; the mRNA level of GAPDH was used as an internal control. The data for EV71 viral titers in the supernatant were measured as previously described. (B) The EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA was transfected into RD-sh-control and RD-sh-CypA cells, and the luciferase levels were quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity in relative luminescence units at 24 hpi; the firefly luciferase activity of pNL4-3 was used as an internal control. The growth curves of wt-EV71 (C) and S243P-EV71 (D) in RD-sh-control or RD-sh-CypA cells at an MOI of 50.

However, recent biochemical and structural studies have suggested that simply heating the 160S particles near 60uC induces virus expansion and RNA genome release, and heating over 65uC leads to the subsequent protein melting of virions during uncoating [36] . We next used a previously reported virion flotation assay [21] , which is used to detect the conversion of 160S particles into other forms during viral uncoating, to check whether the uncoating process of EV71 entry could be affected by CypA. To be consistent, EV71 virions that were treated at 61uC exhibited a smaller shift (Fig. 5F , blue line) from the native peak (160S) (Fig. 5F , black line) after ultracentrifugation in a 1.1-1.5 g/ml discontinuous CsCl gradient, whereas the virions that were treated at 68uC exhibited a much larger shift (Fig. 5F, red line) .",

Among all reported EV71 functional receptors, SCARB2 is the only one that can mediate both attachment to the host cell and uncoating [21] . PSGL-1 cannot induce the conversion from mature 160S particles to other forms during the viral uncoating process [21] . In a recent result, Nishimur et al. reported that the H-I loop of VP1 plays an essential role in EV71 recognition through one of its functional receptors, namely PSGL-1, and they demonstrated that the substitution of VP1-K242 and K244, which are located in the VP1 H-I loop, significantly attenuated virus binding to PSGL-1 [37] . They also indicated that the VP1 E145 residue modulates the orientation of VP1 K244 and thus regulates the exposure of the positively charged lysine side chain, which in turn regulates receptor binding [37] . Moreover, Tan et al. showed that EV71 binds to heparan sulfate on the cell surface, and they suggested that heparan sulfate may bind to the positively charged amino acids (including VP1-K242, K244, and R161) that form a cluster around the five-fold symmetry axis [26] . These findings suggested that the lysine residues at the VP1-242 and 244 positions play essential roles in the binding of the EV71 virus to variable receptors. Interestingly, these two lysine residues are surprisingly very close to the CypA action site in the VP1 H-I loop, which is VP1-S243 (Fig. 7B) . In a very recent result, Lee et al. reported an anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody called MA28-7, which has epitopes at the fivefold vertex that cover the VP1 H-I loop [38] ; this study supports the critical role of the correct H-I loop conformation in the EV71 entry step. By contrast, the binding site of the EV71 virion to SCARB2 was mapped at a canyon of VP1 around residue Q172 [21] , which is far away from S243-VP1. We observed that EV71 virion binding to SCARB2 was not enhanced, but slightly decreased by CypA treatment, suggesting that the CypA function in SCARB2-mediated EV71 entry could be more complicated. Taken together, we propose that CypA plays a role as an uncoating regulator by altering the conformation of the H-I loop in VP1 during the EV71 entry through the PSGL-1 or HSmediated pathway, and CypA has different impacts on the entry of EV71 through various functional receptors.",

Because SCARB2 was previously shown to mediate EV71 uncoating most efficiently at pH 5.6 [21] , we propose that CypA acts to mediate EV71 uncoating before SCARB2 during the maturation of late endosomes. With the increasing maturation of late endosomes and acidification, the EV71 uncoating regulator transfers from CypA to the next one, namely SCARB2. A similar observation was also found for the CypA study in HPV entry. CypA treatment induced the release of capsid protein L1 from L2 in a pH-dependent manner, in which L1 dissociation from L2 was most efficient at pH 6.0, less efficient at pH 7.4, and undetectable at pH 5.5 and 8.0 [17] , suggesting a complicated process during virus uncoating in endosomes.",

We cannot simply exclude the possibility that CypA may not only be associated with EV71 entry but might also affect other intracellular steps of EV71 protein translation, assembly or secretion in addition to its effects on the entry step. In our results, we actually found that the S243P-EV71 virus proliferated more slowly than the wt-EV71 without CypA inhibitor treatment, although the S243P mutant in VP1 can enhance the interaction between virions and CypA. Moreover, when we infected RD-sh-CypA cells with wt-EV71, although the intracellular genome RNA and VP1 protein level were much lower than that of wt-EV71-infected RD-sh-control cells, the supernatant virus titer exhibited no significant difference. Interestingly, the downregulation of CypB did not attenuate but actually increased EV71 RNA replication and VP1 expression (Figs. 2C and 2D), and the expression of endogenous CypB was also upregulated by EV71 infection (Fig. 2H) . Moreover, the S243P mutant recovered both the RNA replication and protein expression of EV71 in RD-sh-CypA cells, but presented discrepancies in RD-sh-CypB cells, i.e., slightly increased RNA replication but decreased protein expression (Figs. 2C and 2E). Interestingly, two recent works revealed that Cyps inhibited the proliferation of HIV-1 virus, which is in opposition to the previously identified positive function of Cyps in the HIV-1 life cycle [9, 44, 45] . All these findings indicated that Cyps may have multiple functions in the EV71 life cycle and may have additional (or opposing) effects on viral assembly and secretion. This finding requires further validation.",

The proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked for 4 h with 5% nonfat dry milk solution in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then blotted with specific primary antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence by using a Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BIO-RAD). To allow the pull-down assays to detect the interaction between CypA and the EV71 virion, we incubated 200 ml of the EV71 strain (AnHui1, SK-EV006, S243A/P246A-EV71 and BrCr) (26107 TICD50) with 50 ml of glutathione-sepharose beads containing GST (200 mg) or GST-CypA (200 mg) in 300 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4uC. The beads were then washed three times with PBS, and the complexes were eluted from the glutathione-sepharose beads with reduced glutathione (GSH) solution. We then moved the supernatant to new Eppendorf tubes and added SDS loading buffer. We then incubated the supernatants in boiling water for 5 min and subjected the samples to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by western blot analysis with mouse antibodies against EV71-VP1 or GST. To detect the interaction between CypA and GST-1S or GST-1P, recombinant human CypA was expressed, purified, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Recombinant human CypA (200 mg) was incubated with 50 ml of glutathione-sepharose beads containing GST (200 mg), GST-1S (200 mg), or GST-1P (200 mg) in 300 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer as described above, and the reactions were incubated overnight at 4uC. We then washed the beads three times with PBS and eluted the complexes from the glutathionesepharose beads with reduced GSH solution. The samples were then subjected to western blot analysis, as described above, by using mouse antibodies against GST or CypA. The bands were quantified by ImageJ software.",

The EV71 protein coding region of the genome was amplified by PCR in 5 short fragments as follows:fragment 1 (EV71-718-sense 59-ATCTTGACCCTTAACACAGC-39, EV71-2046-anti 59-GACCATTGGGTGTAGTACCC-39), fragment 2 (EV71-1975-sense 59-CGATCCTGGGCGAAGTGGAC-39, EV71-3345-anti 59-TGTTGTCCAAATTTCCCAAG-39), fragment 3 (EV71-3248-sense 59-TACCTATTCAAAGCCAACCC-39, EV71-4643-anti 59-ATAAAGACATATCCTTGCCG-39), fragment 4 (EV71-4569-sense 59-ACGGCTACAAGCAACAG-GTG-39, EV71-6044-anti 59-TTCCCTCGAAGATATCATG-G-39), and fragment 5 (EV71-5972-sense 59-GGAAGGCTCAA-CATCAATGG-39, EV71-7345-anti 59-GGGTTGAGGTGTG-TATAGCC-39).The short RT-PCR products of the resistant EV71 virus or the control EV71 virus were ligated into the TA cloning vector PMD18-T (Takara). Multiple individual bacterial colonies were isolated for each time point, and the purified plasmid DNA was sequenced. The sequences were aligned with Sequencher 5.0 and BioEdit software.Generating an EV71 mutant recombinant virusThe mutant EV71 recombinant virus clone was constructed on the basis of the pUC18-EV71AH1 plasmid, which contained the original full-length EV71 AnHui1 strain. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange Lighting Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers were designed as follows: S243P-EV71(59-GTGGGGACCTCCAAGC-CCAAGTACCCTTTAG-39), S243A-EV71(59-GTGGGGACC-TCCAAGGCCAAGTACCCTTTAG-39), P246A-EV71(59-GG-ACCTCCAAGTCCAAGTACGCTTTAGTGGTTAGAATTT-ACATG-39), S243P/P246A-EV71(59-GTGGGGACCTCCAAG-CCCAAGTACGCTTTAGTGGTTAGA ATTTAC-39), and S243A/P246A-EV71(59-GTGGGGACCTCCAAGGCCAAGT-ACGCTTTA GTGGTTAGAATTTAC-39). The constructs were confirmed by sequencing.",
