Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections.",

Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-\u03b3-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody-and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-\u03b3 concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-\u03b3 production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-\u03b3 concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum.",

[6] and since then it has been globally reported in endemic areas [5, 7] . While subclinical feline infections are common in areas where canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is endemic, clinical illness due to FeL is rare [7, 8] . Clinical disease is frequently associated with possible impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral co-infections, immunosuppressive therapy, or malignant neoplasia [7, 8] . The immune response plays a crucial role in the control of Leishmania infection. Albeit some differences according to the host species, T cells modulate and orient, through cytokine production, macrophage reaction to the parasite [9] [10] [11] . Antigen processing cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) present L. infantum antigens to CD4 + T cells that modulate the type of immune response [12] . A T helper 1 (Th1) oriented immune response, associated with production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), stimulates phagocytosis by macrophages, their production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediate and consequent phagocyte-based parasite intracellular elimination [11, 13] . Conversely, in dogs susceptibility to infection and disease progression is mediated predominantly by a non-protective T helper 2 (Th2) immune response and the production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) which are associated with downregulation of the cellular immune response, a high level of antibodies, and L. infantum dissemination [9] [10] [11] .",

The unique IFN\u03b3-p cat positive to Leishmania-PCR (125 L. infantum amastigotes/ml) tested high positive by both IFAT (titer 40960) and ELISA (> 346.3 EU). This cat was adult, FeLV-positive, suffered from squamous cell carcinoma and Leishmania amastigotes were detected at cytological evaluation of the neoplastic cutaneous lesion. Sick and apparently healthy cats had the same prevalences of IFN\u03b3-p individuals (Table 2) ; however, sick IFN\u03b3-p cats had a significantly higher level of LSA IFN-\u03b3 (Mann-Whitney U-test, Z = 47, P = 0.0056) ( Table 3) . The prevalence of cats producing IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with ConA was above 90% in both groups (Table 2) ; however, among 64 cats exposed to L. infantum (i.e. positive to at least one specific test), sick individuals (n = 25) had a significantly higher median concentration [2159 pg/ml; (25-75) = 965.3-4508 pg/ml] than apparently healthy cats (n = 39) [1712.5 pg/ml; (25-75) = 87.1-2946 pg/ml] (Mann-Whitney U-test, Z = 339, P = 0.0117). The concentration of IFN-\u03b3 produced after stimulation with ConA was significantly higher in the IFN\u03b3-p group (Mann-Whitney U-test, Z = 1473, P = 0.0008) ( Table 3) and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations after ConA or LSA stimulations were positively correlated (Spearman's correlation coefficient, r s = 0.264, P = 0.0001). Additionally, ELISA antibody levels were positively correlated with IFN-\u03b3 ",

These findings are similar to data from studies of CanL [10, 28] . As expected, concentrations of ConA-IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher than LSA-IFN-\u03b3 and they were positively correlated. Production of ConA-IFN-\u03b3 suggests non-specific T cell activation. Surprisingly, when considering cats exposed to L. infantum (i.e. positive to at least one the specific tests performed), sick individuals produced a significantly higher level of ConA compared to apparently healthy individuals. This finding is unusual, and it is difficult to when a significantly lower concentration is observed [10] . The prevalence of anti-L. infantum antibodies obtained in this study by combination of both IFAT and ELISA results was similar in the two regions with an approximate value of 20%. It is not easy, therefore, to explain the higher frequency and level of positivity of ELISA in Sicilian cats but these cats were more frequently found sick compared to Catalan cats ( Table 2 ). Previous studies conducted in Sicily were based on IFAT and, when the same cut-off was used, anti-L. infantum antibody prevalence ranged between 6.6-29% [19, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Conversely, only two studies evaluated anti-L. infantum antibody prevalence in Catalonia; they both used ELISA and antibody prevalence was 1.7 and 5.3%, respectively [14, 33] . However, as already reported, we found a positive correlation between ELISA and IFAT [21] .",

In fact, the prevalence of L. infantum was 5% for blood PCR and 22% for antibody detection but the combination of results obtained by serological and molecular testing did not increase the percentage of positivity because all PCR positive cats were also positive for L. infantum antibodies (Fig. 1) . However, when also considering positivity for L. infantum-specific IFN-\u03b3 production, the overall L. infantum prevalence raised to 36%. These data confirm that a considerable percentage of the studied cats had contact with L. infantum and that detection of cell-mediated immune response by measuring specific IFN-\u03b3 production provides a better estimation of exposure of cats to L. infantum in endemic areas as seen in dogs with different techniques [34, 36] .",
