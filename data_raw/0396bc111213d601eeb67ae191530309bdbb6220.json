Given their high lethality, a comprehensive understanding of filoviral pathogenesis is urgently needed. In the present studies, we revealed that the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1) gene deletion protects vasculature in ex vivo explants from EBOV infection. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 using EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs) mimicked the EPAC1 knockout phenotype in the ex vivo model. ESI treatment dramatically decreased EBOV infectivity in both ex vivo vasculature and in vitro vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, postexposure protection of ECs against EBOV infection was conferred using ESIs. Protective efficacy of ESIs in ECs was observed also in MARV infection. Additional studies using a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype that expresses EBOV glycoprotein (EGP-VSV) confirmed that ESIs reduced infection in ECs. Ultrastructural studies suggested that ESIs blocked EGP-VSV internalization via inhibition of macropinocytosis. The inactivation of EPAC1 affects the early stage of viral entry after viral binding to the cell surface, but before early endosome formation, in a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner. Our study delineated a new critical role of EPAC1 during EBOV uptake into ECs.",

To date, all human outbreaks of EBOV have been traced to equatorial Africa [3] . From 2013 to 2016, the most dangerous and geographically widespread outbreak of EBOV infection in humans on record occurred in West Africa. A new EBOV outbreak was declared on 15 May 2018 in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa, a week after the western outbreak in the country was over [7] . Notably, increased travel led to the importation of EBOV and MARV into non-endemic areas around the globe [8] . Several potential vaccine candidates have moved into clinical trials, including a pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein (EGP-VSV)-based vaccine [9, 10] . However, currently, neither vaccines nor postexposure treatments have been FDA-approved for combating filoviral infections [11] [12] [13] [14] . Given their high lethality, a comprehensive understanding of filoviral pathogenesis and the development of novel mechanism-based prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed.",

Filoviral infection initiates diffuse vascular endothelium dysfunction marked by bleeding, fluid distribution disorders, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to organ failure in the latter stages of disease [17, 19, [22] [23] [24] . The vascular endothelium is a monolayer of cells lining blood vessels. Under physiological conditions, the endothelium plays a pivotal role in providing the proper hemostatic balance. Dysregulation of the barrier formed by the endothelium can increase vascular permeability and cause hypotensive shock syndrome; it is seen in many fatal diseases, including VHF cases [18, 19] . However, the mechanism(s) triggering endothelium disruption during EBOV infection is still not fully understood.",

Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 using ESI09 and another ESI, NY0123 [42] , mimicked the EPAC1-null phenotype in the ex vivo model. ESI treatment dramatically decreased EBOV infectivity in both ex vivo vasculatures and BMECs isolated from wild-type mice. Furthermore, postexposure protection of ECs against EBOV infection was conferred by pharmacological inactivation of EPAC1 using these ESIs. Employing EGP-VSV to resemble EBOV infection, we showed that ESI09 reduced EGP-VSV infection in ECs. Nevertheless, the EPAC1-specific activator (ESA) I942 [43] rendered ECs susceptible to EBOV infection after ESI09 pretreatment. Ultrastructural studies revealed that inactivation of EPAC1 blocked EGP-VSV internalization. Mechanistic studies suggested that, during the early stage of infection, activation of host phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) can attenuate the in vitro efficacy of ESI09 against EGP-VSV infection in ECs. Our data strongly suggest that EPAC1 plays a critical role during EBOV uptake into ECs.",

EPAC1 (also known as Rapgef3) mutant mice carrying a conditional-ready allele (B6; 129S2-Rapgef3 tm1Geno /J, the Jackson Laboratory, Stock No. 018389) were obtained, and crossed with a germline Cre deletion mouse, C57BL/6-Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw/J (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No. 003651), to generate knockout mice. The majority of the mice used in experiments (homozygotes and wild-type controls) were C57BL/6J incipient congenic (N5) and generated by heterozygous intercrosses. Similar to published models [44, 45] , our EPAC1-null mice are viable, fertile, and without overt abnormalities. Briefly, after euthanization, aortae were first dissected from mice and then cleaned of adipose tissue, then cut into five rings per mouse aorta. A total of 30 aortic rings were cultured for 48 h in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium supplemented (Cell Applications, Atlanta, GA, USA) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS. Three rings per mouse were exposed to EBOV at 1.6 \u00d7 10 6 plaque-forming units (pfu) in 500 \u00b5L medium in one well of a 24-well culture plate, and the other three rings from the same mouse were incubated in uninfected medium until microscopic evidence of neocellular growth was present after 1 week to confirm the viability of the cultures. At the end of the experiment, all aortic rings were immersion-fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis. After the first group of five continuous sections, tissue sections of aortic rings were collected and stored at 4 \u2022 C before being processed using immunofluorescence (IF) reagents to detect EBOV and von Willebrand factor (vWF).",

PKA-specific inhibitor H89 was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). ESI NY0123 and ESA I942 were synthesized in Dr. Jia Zhou's laboratory at UTMB. NY0123 has similar EPAC inhibitory profiles to ESI09 but is slightly more potent [46] . For in vitro studies, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Cell Applications, Atlanta, GA, USA) or human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) (Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada) were exposed to 5 \u00b5M EIS09, NY0123, I942, or 10 \u00b5M H89 in medium for designated times prior to downstream experiments. Medium with 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vol/vol) was used as a vehicle control. For activation of PI3K, cells were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M 740YP for 3 h. To determine the effects of ESI09, NY0123, and I942 on HUVEC viability in vitro, cytotoxicity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay kit after culturing HUVECs with serial dilutions (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5M) of ESI09, NY0123, and I942 separately for 24 h. Untreated HUVECs served as controls. The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a BioTek ELx808 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of three independent experiments; each experiment was conducted in triplicate. ",

In HUVECs pretreated with DMSO, we observed that EGP-VSV triggered cell membrane ruffling and entered cells mostly by a macropinocytosis-like pathway [45, 48] . EM studies also showed single or agglomerated EGP-VSV particles in the vesicular compartments ( Figure 3B-E) . In contrast, in HUVECs pretreated with ESI09, EGP-VSV particles were observed on the surfaces of cell membranes ( Figure 3F,G) . EGP-VSV particles were rarely observed during the macropinocytosis-like process, and few EGP-VSV particles were found in vesicular compartments. These data suggest that inactivation of EPAC1 affects the early stages of viral infection, rather than later fusion or replication stages. To better define the inhibitory effect of ESI09 on EBOV infection, we measured the number of EGP-VSV RNA copies present in the membrane and early endosome fractions. HUVECs grown in flasks pretreated with ESI09 or DMSO were incubated with EGP-VSV at an MOI of 200 for 1 h, then rinsed thoroughly before being processed for membrane and early endosome fractionation, respectively ( Figure 3I ). In the membrane fractions, viral RNA was detected in both groups and revealed no significant differences ( Figure 3J ), whereas no viral RNA was detected in early endosome fractions from the ESI09-treated group. As expected, viral RNA was found in the early endosome fractions of the Vehicle-treated group (p < 0.001) ( Figure 3K ). These results confirm that no viral RNA copies are detected in early endosome compartments of ECs following inactivation of EPAC1.",

Activation of PI3K in ESI09-pretreated ECs significantly reduced the protective efficacy of ESI09 compared with the ESI09-treated group that did not receive 740YP To examine whether ESI09 affects viral binding to ECs, a virus binding assay was performed by incubating DMSO-or ESI09-pretreated HUVECs with EGP-VSV at an MOI of 20 for 15 min to allow the viral particles to bind to the cell surfaces. Bound viruses were analyzed by qPCR. As shown in Figure 3H , the number of viral RNA copies of membrane-bound viral particles detected in the ESI09-pretreated group was not significantly different when compared to the Vehicle-pretreated group.

Two types of nonspecific receptors have been identified: C-type lectins [59] and phosphatidylserine receptors [48, 54, 60, 61] . In the present study, the viral binding assay using EGP-VSV showed no significant differences between DMSO-and ESI09-treated HUVECs, suggesting that EBOV binds to the endothelial surface in an EPAC1-independent manner. However, ultrastructural experiments revealed that EGP-VSV is internalized into ECs via macropinocytosis in an EPAC1-dependent manner. These findings are compatible with previous studies that showed that the cAMP-EPAC signaling pathway is required for the regulation of compartmentalization of endosomes [62] [63] [64] . Importantly, inactivation of EPAC1 by ESI09 dramatically reduced the number of viral RNA copies in early endosome compartments, suggesting that EPAC1 is a potential target for controlling EBOV infection in ECs using ESIs.",

However, deeper insight into the requirement of cell signaling pathways for EBOV uptake remains scarce. One of the current views of EBOV uptake is that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the host plasma membrane serve as an important platform used by EBOV to enter cells [67] . Although it is the least abundant phospholipid in the cell membrane, phosphatidylinositol is one of the most versatile signaling molecules in cells and plays an important role in endocytosis [68] . PI3K plays a well-characterized role in macropinocytosis, where it orchestrates signaling and cytoskeletal modulation during protrusion, extension, and closure of macropinosome formation [68] . Activation of PI3K has been observed upon virus binding in a number of infection models of enveloped viruses [68] . EBOV induces its internalization into host cells by a viral GP-triggered entry mechanism employing the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [49, 50] . Considering that activation of EPAC stimulates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [51] , it is conceivable that EPAC1 may regulate EBOV uptake by modulating the cellular PI3K-Akt signaling system. EPAC1 is known to regulate all of the aforementioned cellular functions, but the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which EPAC1 controls EBOV entry is not clear. Further research into understanding the signal cross-talk between EPAC1 and PI3K signaling pathways hijacked by EBOV during macropinocytosis is currently ongoing.",

It appears that EBOV replicates in ECs in clusters rather than in neighboring cells in the same monolayer, suggesting that there is a window following the initial infection of the ECs in the cluster to protect neighboring cells from viral infection. However, future observation of longer periods of time postinfection will provide more accurate information to support the potential postexposure protection conferred by ESIs.

            "text": "Nevertheless, there were limitations in our present study to elucidate the exact mechanism(s) underlying the inactivation of EPAC1 attenuating EBOV infection in ECs. First, the ex vivo model allows us to perform comparative studies between WT and KO groups. However, it cannot mimic the complicated host responses in the context of in vivo infection. Second, a non-mouse-adapted Ebola virus used in our ex vivo mouse model may not be directly translated into in vivo applications since wild-type virus is not pathogenic in mice. Third, histological requirements, including the appropriate orientation of the aortic ring during embedding to show the intima layer during microtomy and effective antigen retrieve during IF staining, make it difficult to optimize EC-specific staining of vWF. Last, measuring the level of Akt-1 phosphorylation between Vehicle-, ESI09-, and I942-treated groups only provides indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that the PI3K signaling system is involved in the mechanism underlying the protection against EBOV infection via inactivation of EPAC1. An accurate mechanism is yet to be elucidated.",

In vascular ECs, EPAC1 governs EBOV internalization via regulation of PI3K pathway-mediated filoviral macropinocytosis. Deeper insights will be gained by future in vivo studies using EPAC1-null mouse models of EBOV infection and in vivo efficacy testing of ESIs using the wild-type mouse model of filoviral infections. These future studies should hopefully pave the way toward the development of novel, broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics to combat filoviral infections.",
