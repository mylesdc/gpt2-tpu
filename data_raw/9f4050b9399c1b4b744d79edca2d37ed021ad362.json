The rectal swabs were soaked in PBS buffer supplemented with penicillin G (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (2 mg/mL) and centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7g for 15 min to collect the supernatant fluids. The supernatant fluids were stored at -80\u00b0C until used. For RNA extraction, we used TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.",

Then, 200 \u03bcL of chloroform was added to the mixture, and the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 \u00d7g. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was precipitated with the same volume isopropanol, maintained at -20\u00b0C for 1 h, and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 \u00d7g. The resulted RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% (v/v) absolute ethanol, centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 \u00d7g and dried, and resuspended in 30 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water. We used the specific primer set for N (nucleocapsid) and M (membrane protein) genes (1, 2). RT-PCR was performed using iScript TM One-Step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR\u00ae Geen (BioRad) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR products were visualized via electrophoresis in a 1~2% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Bands of the correct size were estimated on agarose gel (Fig. S5 ). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined based on 97% similarity of reads. Blue and red coloring represent the normal and PEDV infected groups, respectively. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were assigned to each phylum using the mothur package and a reference database of known 16S rRNA genes obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project.",
