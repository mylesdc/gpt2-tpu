To the authors' knowledge this study reports the first three cases of feline CCA infarction. In dogs, CCA infarction has only been reported in two dogs (2, 5) , and therefore appears to be less common than RCA infarction (6, 7) . Humans with PICA infarction, deemed the equivalent of the CCA (2), have a poorer prognosis than infarcts involving the anterior cerebellar circulation, due to higher tendency of severe mass effect and brainstem compression (3) . The vascular supply of the canine and feline brain differs and this may contribute to differences in cerebrovascular disease incidence and distribution between species (2). Both the feline and canine cerebellum are supplied by two pairs of arteries: the RCA, which supplies the rostral part of the cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, and dorsolateral brainstem, and the CCA, which vascularizes the caudoventral cerebellum and lateral medulla oblongata (8) (9) (10) . The CCA is a branch of the basilar artery in the dog, while in the cat it is supplied by the maxillary artery via arterial circle and a rete mirabile (8, 9) .",

MRI techniques provide additional diagnostic support in distinguishing between acute and historic lesions and from peripheral to central vestibular localization. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and ADC sequences increase the sensitivity and specificity in differentiating an acute from a chronic cerebrovascular disease. The ischemic core of an infarct appears hyperintense on DWI and can be differentiated from other T2-hyperintense lesions due to hypointensity on ADC map, which represents cytotoxic oedema (7) .",

Cerebrovascular disease was deemed cryptogenic in 12.5% of cats in the largest feline study (4) , however presence of a concurrent disease is associated with a poorer prognosis in veterinary medicine and increased likelihood of subsequent recurrent infarction (6, 7) . Feline ischemic cerebrovascular disease is commonly associated with an underlying disease, including hypertension, hyperthyroidism, neoplasia, cardiac disease, and chronic nephropathies (1, 4) . In both reported cases of feline RCA infarction, concurrent predisposing disease (pulmonary adenocarcinoma and cardiac disease) was present (1). Complete screening for concurrent disease in the present cases was declined in two cases. An underlying pathology including occult cardiomyopathy, could therefore not be ruled out, however no abnormalities were detected on cardiac auscultation in these two cases and from the history all cats were reported healthy prior to presentation.",
