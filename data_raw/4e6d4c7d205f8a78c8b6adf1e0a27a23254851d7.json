It was previously reported that ORF4b mainly co-localized with the nucleus and functions as an IFN antagonist 15, 17 ; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Thus, we characterized ORF4b-mediated inhibition of type I IFN production. First, a plasmid encoding ORF4b was transfected into HeLa cells, and the subcellular localization of ORF4b was observed. Consistent with previous reports, ORF4b protein predominantly localized to the nucleus with a fraction dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, unlike SARS ORF3b 27 , ORF4b-expressing cells did not show growth defects or signs of apoptosis (Fig. 1B) . To confirm the inhibitory function of type I IFN production, we transfected 293T cells with increasing amounts of ORF4b-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1C ), together with a plasmid expressing firefly luciferase reporter driven by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase that served as the internal control. As expected, expression of ORF4b protein resulted in the significant suppression of SeV-induced activation of the IFN promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D ).",

ORF4b-mediated inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and IRF3 activation suggests that the protein targets one or several components of the RLR signaling pathway. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize 5\u2032 -triphosphate RNA and dsRNA from RNA viruses and initiate host antiviral responses, whereby a number of downstream molecules are recruited or activated 21 . To characterize the possible step and molecular target of ORF4b in the IFN induction signaling pathway, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed. The 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Flag-tagged RIG-I, MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , TBK1, and GFP-tagged IRF3 and MAVS with ORF4b. Although comparable expression levels of both ORF4b protein and the transducer proteins were observed in 293T cells, ORF4b protein co-immunoprecipitated with MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1, but not with RIG-I, MAVS, or IRF3 ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, precipitation with HA or Flag/GFP antibodies yielded similar results ( Fig. 2A) , and also the co-localization of ORF4b and MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1 was found in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that the ORF4b protein interacts with MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1. Furthermore, to determine whether ORF4b interacts with the endogenous MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1, we transfected 293T cells with ORF4b expressing plasmid. Then ORF4b was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blotting using anti-MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1 monoclonal antibody. In agreement with the former observation, the endogenous MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1 proteins were successfully co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2C) . These results suggest that ORF4b inhibited IFN-\u03b2 expression by targeting MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 , a step upstream of IRF3.",

Since ORF4b localizes to the nucleus, which may contribute to inhibition of IRF3-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 , it implied that ORF4b could also inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03b2 in the nucleus. We hypothesized that abolishing the nuclear import of ORF4b would result in its inability to inhibit IRF3-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 . To explore this hypothesis, we constructed a truncated ORF4b with a deletion of the N-terminal 2-38 amino acids (aa), which correspond to the predicted NLS-containing region. As expected, ORF4b (\u0394 2-38) exclusively localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) , and inhibited the induction of IFN-\u03b2 by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK-1 at comparable levels as ORF4b, but not IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig. 3B,C) . In accordance with these results, ORF4b (\u0394 2-38) was easily found to interact and co-localize with MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK-1 (Fig. 3D,E) .

In 293T cells co-transfected with ORF4b and either Flag-MDA5C or Flag-MDA5H, ORF4b co-immunoprecipitated with both constructs, whereas a stronger interaction was observed with MDA5C ( Fig. 4A ). Because MDA5 recognizes (B) Co-localization of ORF4b protein with MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 . HeLa cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein and the indicated expression plasmids for Flag-tagged MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 . Cells were then stained for ORF4b and MDA5/TBK1/IKK\u03b5 with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. The green (ORF4b) and red (MDA5/TBK1/IKK\u03b5 ) fluorescent signals were merged. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a 100\u00d7 objective, and representative images are shown. Scale bar, 20 \u03bc m. (C) association of ORF4b protein with endogenous MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 . 293T cells were transfected with ORF4b expressing plasmid and immunoprecipitated by anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blotting using anti-MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1 monoclonal antibody. (D) ORF4b could also inhibit interferon-inducing activity of IRF-3 and IRF7. Experiments were carried out as in Fig. 1D except that 293T cells were not stimulated with SeV but co-transfected with plasmids expressing MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, IKK\u03b5 , IRF3 and IRF7. Data are representative of three independent experiments with triplicate samples. viral RNA, it delivers the activation signal to MAVS through a direct interaction via its CARD motif. Therefore, we explored whether ORF4b protein impaired this process. The 293T cells were co-transfected with MDA5 and MAVS, along with ORF4b-expressing plasmid or an empty vector. MDA5 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag monoclonal antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitation of MAVS was assessed by Western blotting using anti-MAVS monoclonal antibody. As expected, MDA5 co-immunoprecipitated with MAVS, with no difference in the absence or presence of ORF4b (Fig. 4B ).",

First, the capacity of ORF4b to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation was tested using a transfection assay. Phosphorylated IRF3 was detected in cultured 293T cells expressing IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 alone, but with a significant decrease in cells simultaneously expressing IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 and ORF4b protein, whereas comparable amounts of IRF3 were found in all groups of cells (Fig. 5A) . Moreover, ORF4b protein inhibited IKK\u03b5 /TBK1-induced nuclear translocation of IRF3. Hela cells were co-transfected with IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 and GFP-IRF3, along with ORF4b-expressing plasmid or an empty vector. At 24 h p.t., cells were fixed and permeabilized, and intracellular staining for IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 was performed using anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (red) with anti-HA monoclonal antibody staining to visualize ORF4b (blue). Nuclear translocation of GFP-IRF3 was observed (green) in cells expressing IKK\u03b5 /TBK1, but not ORF4b (Fig. 5B , indicated as red arrows). However, in ORF4b-expressing cells, the translocation of IRF3 was inhibited. These results suggest that IKK\u03b5 or TBK1 mediated IRF3 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation was inhibited by ORF4b protein. As ORF4b (\u0394 2-38) could also interact with IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, unsurprisingly, it could inhibit IKK\u03b5 / TBK1-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation as well (Fig. 5C,D) .",

The finding that ORF4b protein binds IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, coupled with the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation induced by these kinases, suggests that ORF4b may block the interaction between IKK\u03b5 or TBK-1 and their IRF substrates. To explore this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. First, cells were co-transfected with IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 and IRF-3 plasmids in the absence or presence of ORF4b-expressing plasmid. IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-Flag antibody, and co-immunoprecipitation of IRF3 was assessed by Western blotting using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The results showed that both IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 pulled down IRF3, whereas there was no difference between the absence and presence of ORF4b (Fig. 6A) .

Consequently, to combat the antiviral effects of IFN, many viruses (including coronavirus) have adapted strategies to evade or even inhibit key elements of host IFN responses, and multiple virus-encoded proteins are involved in this process 30 . To the best of our knowledge, at least nine proteins encoded by SARS-CoV have been identified as IFN antagonists: nsp1, PLP, nsp7, nsp15, N, M, ORF3b, ORF6, and ORF9b 31-41 . Similar to SARS-CoV, previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV infection failed to elicit strong type I or III IFN or pro-inflammatory innate immune responses in ex vivo respiratory tissue cultures 11, 12 , and the infection is impeded to some extent by exogenously added IFNs 13, 14 .

Here, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ORF4b protein inhibits IFN expression signaling. As SeV is a strong inducer of the RLR-mediated IFN signaling pathway 23 , ORF4b-mediated inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, and IRF3 activation suggests that the protein targets one or several components of the RLR signaling pathway. Thus, we screened several components of the RLR signaling pathway and determined ORF4b could specifically bind to MDA5, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK1. ORF4b protein interacted with both the MDA5C (containing the amino-terminal CARD domain, aa 1-287) and MDA5H (containing the carboxyl terminal helicase domain, aa 287-1025), showing a stronger interaction with MDA5C. Because MDA5 delivers the activation signal to MAVS through a direct interaction via its CARD motif, we explored whether ORF4b protein impaired this process. However, ORF4b did not affect this process, indicating that the interaction between ORF4b and MDA5 may not contribute to ORF4b-mediated inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 induction by impairing formation of the MDA5 and MAVS complex. In addition, ORF4b specifically reduced IKK\u03b5 and TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. RLRs and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the two main host PRRs for RNA viruses by recruiting different downstream adaptors for IFN signaling. However, they both utilize IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 to phosphorylate IRFs, thereby inducing the subsequent transcription and synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 8, 9 . Given the importance of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 in the IFN signaling pathway, it is not surprising that viruses have evolved mechanisms that target them to inhibit IFN production. Several other RNA viruses are known to encode proteins that impair IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 function and antagonize IFN response. The M protein of SARS-CoV 40 , NS2 protein of HCV 42 , VP35 protein of Ebola virus 29 , V proteins of paramyxoviruses 43 , and P proteins of rabies 44 inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3 by impeding the formation of TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex by acting as an alternative substrate and/or by disrupting the IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 interaction with other signaling components including MAVS, IRF3, and IRF7. When we explored how ORF4b leads to the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation, we found that ORF4b did not disrupt the IKK\u03b5 /TBK1-IRF3 or IKK\u03b5 /TBK1-IRF7 complex, but disturbed IKK\u03b5 -MAVS complex formation. MAVS is an important adaptor and upstream binding partner of IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 that is important for the activation of these kinases and the production of IFN-\u03b2 in the RLR pathway [22] [23] [24] . The capacity of ORF4b to target the IKK\u03b5 -MAVS interaction suggests that ORF4b may be able to at least partially prevent the activation of IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 kinases, serving as one of the mechanisms to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation 29 . As current opinion comes to that MAVS has to recruit TRAF3, which subsequently activate IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1, it will be necessary to testify whether ORF4b affects TRAF3 interaction with either MAVS, IKK\u03b5 or TBK-1 in the future work. And furthermore, it remains unclear whether ORF4b can also inhibit IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 kinase activity through some other mechanism, such as inhibition of IKK\u03b5 /TBK1 kinase activity. To clarify these, biophysical methods such as in vitro kinase assays could be performed to assess the impact of ORF4b on TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 activity.",

Interestingly, ORF4b not only inhibited the induction of IFN-\u03b2 by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK\u03b5 , and TBK-1, but also IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 . Furthermore, when we abolished nuclear import of ORF4b, it could no longer inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 , RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK\u03b5 , or TBK-1, suggesting that ORF4b could inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03b2 both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Several viral proteins have been shown to inhibit the transcription of mRNA of IFN-\u03b2 transcription in the nucleus through different mechanisms. HSV NS1 protein associates with IRF-3 and its transcriptional coactivator CBP, leading to disrupted association of IRF-3 to CBP and reduced binding of IRF-3 to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter 45 ; RVFV NSs protein binds SAP30 (a subunit of complexes intervening in gene transcription regulation) and SAP30 associates with YY1 (the activator/repressor of IFN transcription), forming a multi-protein repression complex on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter 46 . Viral proteins could also inhibit RNA polymerase II transcription by triggering degradation of RNAP II 47-50 , triggering the loss of a specific phosphorylated form of RNAP II 51 , associating with MED8 (component of mediator, a protein complex necessary for mRNA production) 52 and interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) to inhibit RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation 53 . However, fractionation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins could be used to detect the mechanisms how ORF4b inhibit IFN production in nucleus and determine if ORF4b utilizes similar mechanisms as those aforementioned.",
