Commercial PRRSV killed and modified live vaccines cannot provide complete protection against HP-PRRSV due to genetic variation. Development of more effective vaccines against the emerging HP-PRRSV is urgently required. In our previous studies, two formulations of DNA vaccines (pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5) based on the HP-PRRSV were constructed and shown to induce enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response induced by these novel formulations in piglets. PcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb1-SynORF5 and BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 vaccines induced significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody and PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody in pigs compared with the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 parental construct. Though IFN-\u03b3 levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses induced by the two DNA vaccine formulations were comparable to that induced by the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct, each of the novel formulations provided efficient protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV. Non-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 compared with other groups. Thus, these novel DNA constructs may represent promising candidate vaccines against emerging HP-PRRSV.",

DNA vaccines are the third revolution in the vaccine field, and have been found to be safe to the host while generating both humoral and cellular immunity 24, 25 . Moreover, DNA vaccines can be easily modified to enhance the poor immunogenicity. Adjuvants including immunopotentiator and delivery systems were necessary for the development of DNA vaccines. In order to increase the efficiency of the PRRSV vaccines, they were modified with immunopotentiators, including HSP70 26 , IL-18 8 , GM-CSF 27 , CD40L 28 , CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 29,30 , IL-2 31 , CTLA4 32 and interferon \u03b1 /\u03b2 33 .

In our previous studies, an immunopotentiator (PoIFN-\u03bb 1) and delivery system (BPEI/PLGA) were applied to modify pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 constructs, based on the HP-PRRSV JSKM strain. We demonstrated that both formulations of DNA vaccine could improve the immunogenicity of pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 in a mouse model. Thus, in this study, we chose to evaluate the immune response induced following inoculation of piglets with the two DNA vaccine formulations to establish an attractive candidate vaccine against HP-PRRSV. To our knowledge this is the first report of a comparative efficacy test of two formulations of adjuvants (immunopotentiator and delivery system) used to modify a PRRSV DNA vaccine in pigs.",

The pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb 1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs did, however, drive stronger T cell differentiation compared with the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct as early as 14 days after primary immunization. These results are consistent with previous studies by Dwivedi et al. and Binjawadagi et al. [38] [39] [40] [41] . To investigate the level of protection elicited by pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb 1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5, all the test pigs were challenged at 28 dpi with the HP-PRRSV JSKM strain. The results presented showed that all pigs in the control group showed more severe clinical signs than the vaccinated groups. Rectal temperatures of all test groups were coincident with the viremia detected by real-time RT-PCR. No obvious clinical signs or pathological changes could be observed in the groups inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or JXA1-R. Given these observations, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 may provide more effective protection for pigs, although the viremia could not be fully prevented after virus challenge. Although virus could still be detected in the tissues of all pigs at the end of the experiment, viral loads in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node from pigs in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group were significantly lower than those from the PBS group, which indicates that piglets inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 can successfully restrict viral replication in tissues.

Moreover, there are reports of reversion of vaccine virus into virulence leading to severe disease outbreaks, and like the field virus, PRRS-MLV also induces immunosuppression. However, DNA vaccine, without reversion to high virulence, was safe to the host while generating both humoral and cellular immunity and could be easily modified with immunopotentiator and delivery systems. The constructs of PRRSV with the potential to induce immunosuppression could be avoided when designing PRRSV DNA vaccine. Based on our current results, we can also modify pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 by inserting PRRSV ORF3 and ORF6, with the potential to induce protective immune responses.",

Studies on adjuvanted PLGA nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine have demonstrated that it could provide cross-protective immunity against PRRSV in pigs [38] [39] [40] [41] . As we can modify pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 by inserting other genes encoding immunogenic proteins or heterologous PRRSV ORF5 genes, we speculated that PRRSV DNA vaccine adjuvanted with PLGA nanoparticles may be a potential vaccine candidate, and thus demonstrated that BPEI/PLGA nanoparticles show potential for use in development of PRRSV vaccines.",

The method of adsorption would protect antigens from this limitation. Furthermore, BPEI was utilized to modify the PLGA nanoparticle in order to improve the efficiency of adsorption. Compared with other DNA vaccine of PRRSV such as pCA-U-optiGP5 9 , pcDNA-5L6, pcDNA-6L5 47 , and pVAX1-EU-ORF3-ORF5 37 , BPEI modified PLGA nanoparticles could improve the delivery of adsorbed DNA into antigen-presenting cells after i.m. injection. Although these DNA vaccines could enhance the immune response, they didn't provide enough protection after challenge. It is believed that adsorption of the DNA vaccine on BPEI/PLGA allows it to be presented in particulate form, which appears to be more antigenic and can be efficiently phagocytosed 48 .",

Both the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb 1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 formulations induced enhanced immune responses compared with the parent construct pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, and provided protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV JSKM strains. BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 elicited the strongest responses and thus may provide the most efficient protection against PRRSV infection among the parent construct pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb 1-SynORF5 and BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5. And BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 may represent promising candidate vaccines against PRRSV. Animal study design. Twenty-five piglets weaned at 3 weeks of age were obtained from a PRRS-free farm in Nanjing. The piglets were confirmed negative for PRRSV by RT-PCR and ELISA (IDEXX). The piglets were then randomly separated into five groups, housed in separate rooms at the animal facility of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Three groups were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at 2-week intervals with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb 1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 or BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 dissolved in 1 mL of PBS, each containg 500 \u03bc g plasmids. The fourth group was injected intramuscularly once with commercial PRRSV attenuated vaccine (HP-PRRS vaccine, live strain JXA1-R, Dahuanong, Guangdong, China). The control group was injected intramuscularly with 1 mL of PBS. Serum samples were collected from each pig at 14, 28, 35, 42 and 49 dpi to detect specific anti-PRRSV antibodies. At 28 dpi, fresh PBMCs were collected from inoculated pigs for T lymphocyte proliferation, IFN-\u03b3 release and T cell subset (CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + ) assays.",

Lung samples from pigs were collected from the right cranial lobe and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and 5 \u03bc m sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as described previously 54 . Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's t-test and student's t-test. P < 0.05 represents a statistically significant difference. All data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM).",
