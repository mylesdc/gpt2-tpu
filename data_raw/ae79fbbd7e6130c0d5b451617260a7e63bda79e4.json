            "text": "Acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, also referred to as common cold, is the most frequently observed disease in humans. Respiratory viral infections lead to more than 400.000 hospitalizations per year in children below 18 years of age in the United States [1] . The considerable morbidity and mortality in adults and infants caused by respiratory viral infections has recently been reviewed [2, 3] . The morbidity caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and the ensuing complications are more pronounced in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma [4, 5] . While numerous treatment approaches have been claimed to reduce symptoms [6] , no interventions were conclusively demonstrated to display antiviral activity, and to effectively decrease the duration or severity of manifestations. A recent review reported the lack of efficacy of OTC (over-the-counter) cough and cold medicines in children, and revealed their inability to reduce the rate of severe adverse events [7] . Substances such as diphenhydramine and codeine have been associated with significant side effects in children, thus restricting the applicability of several currently available therapies [8] . Recently, a potent antiviral effect against several respiratory viruses was demonstrated for iota-carrageenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed [9, 10] . Carrageenan has been shown to display antiviral activity against a range of animal viruses [11] and has been tested clinically for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV-1 viral infections [12, 13] . Iota-carrageenan has recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of papilloma virus in-vitro, even at concentrations below 1 \u03bcg/ml [14] . Carrageenan has been used as food additive for centuries. As an indigestible polysaccharide extracted from red algae (seaweed), it was added to foods as a gelling agent or emulsifier. In 1959, carrageenan was granted GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status in the United States, thus documenting the safety of this substance. Carrageenan increases the viscosity if applied as nasal spray, thereby prolonging the humidification of the nasal mucosa. In addition, the solution forms a barrier by direct interaction of carrageenan with viruses, such as human rhinoviruses, which are trapped and inactivated by the polymer. Results of a recent pilot study in 35 adult patients showed that application of a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan three times per day alleviated symptoms of common cold and reduced the viral load in the nasal mucosa. Hereby, the efficacy of Carrageenan was shown on local symptoms, whereas systemic symptoms remained the same [15] .",

This low symptom score of 9 was chosen as inclusion criterion because a higher TSS would have led to the use of more co-medications, potentially biasing the effect of Carrageenan. Immunocompetence was evaluated clinically, including a history of less than 5 bacterial infections per year without a stay on intensive care units and without a history of any chronic disease. URTI was defined by the presence of appropriate symptoms according to a scale described above. Suspected bacterial infections, recent use of antimicrobial drugs, and intranasal treatment at first presentation were exclusion criteria. However, additional medication could be prescribed in case of fever, bacterial otitis, wheezing, persistent coughing or pneumonia upon decision of the physician.

Patients were assigned to receive a nasal spray containing either iotacarrageenan (0.12% / 0.5% sodium chloride) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) in a randomized and blinded manner (allocation ratio 1:1), using simple (unrestricted) randomisation. The concentration of iota-carrageenan and sodium chloride for the study medication was chosen identically compared to the previously performed pilot study [15] , using the optimal galenic composition. The nasal spray containers were sequentially numbered. The random allocation sequence was generated by an independent statistician, the participants were enrolled by a study nurse and the investigating pediatricians assigned participants to the interventions. The children and/or their legal guardians received a standardized diary for the recording of symptoms and additional medication. A single puff (0.14 ml) of the spray per nostril was to be administered three times per day for a total of seven days. The patients and parents were requested to record symptoms permitting assessment of the TSS during the first week of treatment. Over the following two weeks (days 8 to 21), recording of the presence or absence of any symptoms was requested for determination of disease duration. Follow-up examination of the patients and collection of nasal secretion samples for molecular virus testing were performed three to five days into treatment (second visit). Final examination and collection of symptom diaries for the evaluation were carried out on the third visit after day 21. Molecular screening and quantitative assessment of viral load were performed for respiratory viruses including rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza A (InfA) virus, influenza B (InfB) virus, parainfluenzavirus (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3), and coronaviruses (CoV) by methods described previously [17, 18] (for more detailed description of virus analysis see Additional file 1).",
