However, the viral etiologies and clinical characteristics of outpatients with ARIs are poorly understood in China. Here, we identified the viral etiologies in outpatients with ARIs in Huzhou, China. Results: Our results indicated that of 426 outpatients, 246 were positive for viruses. Of them, 221 were positive for a single virus, including influenza A, which comprised H3N2 (28.5%) and pandemic H1N1 (2009) (19.0%), enterovirus (10.4%), and influenza B (8.6%). Other single viruses were detected at less than 8.0%. Twenty-five patients were positively coinfected with two viruses. The prevalent viruses in coinfections were rhinovirus and H3N2 virus (28.0%). Viruses were major pathogens in young children (< 5 years) (75.0%). Coinfections were prevalent in older adults (11. 9%) and young children (9.5%). Virus-positive outpatients presented higher temperatures and more sore throat, fatigue and shortness of breath than virus-negative outpatients. ARIs and most virus detections peaked during the winter, but enteroviruses emerged between April and September. Conclusion: Viruses are major agents of ARIs among outpatients in Huzhou, China. There was a variation in the distribution of viruses across different age groups and seasons. These findings are beneficial for planning prevention and treatment services for outpatients with ARIs.",

It is important to investigate the epidemic viral etiologies of ARIs to efficiently prevent and control viral epidemics in the future. It is well known that the early and rapid molecular detection of respiratory viruses is valuable to prevent and control ARIs [7, 8] . However, only a portion of patients with ARIs have their viral etiologies detected because of the expensive testing costs in China and other developing countries [3, 5, 9, 10] .

Recently, a commercial multiplex PCR assay with a Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection Kit was used to simultaneously and precisely identify the 15 viruses of ARIs in many laboratories [21] [22] [23] [24] . The methods used in this study expanded and improved the capacity for testing viruses (15 viruses and 3 subtypes of FluA virus). In this study, 57.7% were positive for at least one virus, which was similar to the morbidity rates reported in previous studies in Pittsburgh (59.7%) and Vit\u00f3ria of Southeast Brazil (54.3%) [15, 25] , but was different in China and compared with other reports [1, 3-5, 24, 26] . The single infection (89.8%) was predominant in our study, particularly the FluA virus (47.5%), which was consistent with previous reports in Shandong Province, Beijing, of China and other countries [5, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . sH3N2 and RhV coinfections were predominant among viral coinfections, which was different from previous reports [5, 15, 24, 29, 30] . The discrepancy of the predominant coinfections might be closely associated with principal epidemical viruses in the local region. ",

            "text": "The proportion of respiratory viruses notably differed across different age groups; the virus positive rate was the highest in young children under 5 years but was lowest in adults (18~60 years) in this study. These findings indicated that the viruses were the predominant pathogen found in young children with ARIs, and similar morbidity rates have been reported in previous studies [5, 6] , although the morbidity rate in this study also differed from those in other studies [28] . The Flu A virus was the predominant virus among the three age groups, excluding young children, and was highest among older adults (\u226560 years) and lowest among young children; however, EV was the highest in young children among all age groups. Some studies show that EVs and RhVs can be difficult to discriminate with RT-PCR primers unless accompanied by amplicon sequencing, and FluA virus and RhV might fail to detect RhV due to competition between the amplification reactions [21] [22] [23] . Therefore, all positive RhV and/or EV specimens and 10 FluA virus specimens with random selection were identified Table 2 Age distribution of viruses from outpatients with ARIs ARIs, acute respiratory infections by sequencing assay, respectively, and among them, four RhV positive and 3 EV positive specimens were not sequenced due to low viral load in the specimens.",

These results indicated that the detection rate of viruses in ARIs was closely associated with the age of outpatients because age affects immune status, exposure opportunities to viruses, and other lifestyle behaviors of people. Generally, young children and older adults have weak immune systems against viruses, which might contribute to their higher susceptibility to viruses than young adults and adults who have strong immune status against viruses [12, 13] . Moreover, young children have more opportunities for exposure to EVs than young adults and adults, which might cause higher incidences of EV infection than in other age groups [3, 24, 28] . Many studies have indicated that viral ARIs are affected by seasonal distributions and occur commonly in spring, autumn, and winter [3, 5, 15, 20, 27, 29] . In this study, viruses from outpatient ARIs were detected throughout the whole year and commonly occurred in spring and winter, with peaks occurring in February and December 2015. Similar results were reported in other studies [20, 27, 29] . Moreover, our results demonstrated that EV infections occurred between April and September 2015, with the peak detection rate in August 2015, which was in accordance with previous reports [27] . Many studies have shown that EVs are often detected in summer and autumn [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] . We speculate that climate conditions might be an important factor for EV detection in temperate regions. These findings indicated that the geographical diversity of surveillance areas with warm and wet climate conditions beside Tai Lake might contribute to the variability in seasonal trends and viral etiologies of ARIs.",

More large-scale surveillance for ARIs will performed, and analyses over additional years will provide a more accurate picture of seasonal variation in respiratory virus circulation in this community in the future. Second, we detected only viruses, but did not test for bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tracts of outpatients with ARIs; therefore, our data regarding pathogens causing ARIs were not comprehensive, which also affected our ability to determine the relationships between pathogens and disease severity in outpatients with ARIs. Taken together, our results were valuable to a certain degree for assessing outpatients and clinical treatments.",
