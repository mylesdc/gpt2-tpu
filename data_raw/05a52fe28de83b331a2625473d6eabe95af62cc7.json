In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of swine. Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.",

Epidemiological studies have shown that the virus has a worldwide distribution, whereby at least two distinct genetic lineages are cocirculating and reassorting [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Because of the high seroprevalence, cattle is the proposed natural reservoir of IDV, in which IDV causes mild respiratory disease symptoms [11] . In addition to cattle, IDV-specific antibodies have been detected in swine, feral swine, equine, ovine, caprine and camelid species, suggesting a broad host tropism for IDV [3, 4, 9, [12] [13] [14] . However, the most striking observation is the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational exposure to livestock [15] .",

For instance, the utilization of the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a receptor determinant, that allows the hemagglutinin esterase fusion (HEF) glycoprotein of IDV to bind the luminal surface of the human respiratory epithelium [16] . Interestingly, the utilization of this receptor is also described for the closely related Influenza C virus (ICV) [17] . Furthermore, the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational exposure to livestock and the molecular detection of IDV in a nasopharyngeal wash of a field worker with close contact to livestock indicates that cross species transmission occurs [15, 18] . However, thus far, there is no indication of wide spread prevalence among the general population although the virus has been detected during molecular surveillance of aerosols collected at an international airport [19, 20] . Therefore, it remains unclear whether IDV can indeed infect cells within the human respiratory tract and, thus, whether it has a zoonotic potential.",

Moreover, due to the similarity of IDV with ICV, we compared their viral kinetics and cell tropism. This showed that IDV has higher replication kinetics compared to ICV, and that both viruses share a cell tropism preference towards ciliated cells.

For each sample the amplified segments were pooled together at equal molar concentrations in order to reach a uniform sequencing depth for each individual genomic segment. The sequencing libraries of the pooled amplified segments were prepared using the Nextera XT library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina platform using 300 bp paired-end reads, according to manufactures protocol.

Viral progeny release was monitored by collecting washes with 24-h intervals for a duration of 72 h. To analyze temperature dependent effects, incubation of the cultures was performed at temperatures that correspond with those of the human upper and lower respiratory tract, 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C respectively. The release of viral progeny from the apical washes was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR for viral transcripts and virus titration for an infectious virus. The first viral transcripts were detected at 24 h post-infection (hpi) among all donors, independently of the incubation temperature ( Figure 1A,B) . However, some temperature-dependent differences were observed when the infectivity of the progeny virus was analyzed. When incubated at 33 \u2022 C, viral titers were detected for every donor at 48 and 72 hpi, but only one donor shows a viral titer at 24 hpi ( Figure 1C ). In contrast, we observed viral titers as early as 24 hpi for IDV infection at 37 \u2022 C for every donor that increased over time ( Figure 1D ). These results suggest that IDV kinetics seems to be more efficient at ambient temperatures corresponding to the human lower respiratory tract, although the differences between the viral titers at 72 hpi are minor.",

However, commercial antibodies against IDV are currently unavailable, so we ordered a custom generated antibody directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) of the prototypic D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain. After securing the NP-antibody specificity ( Figure S1 ), the microscopic analysis of IDV-infected hAEC cultures revealed clusters of NP-positive cells at both 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C, whereas no fluorescence signal was observed in the control hAEC cultures ( Figure 1E-H) . The majority of the fluorescence signal from the NP-positive cells has a cytoplasmic distribution pattern, but some of those also appeared to have a nuclear staining pattern. These findings suggest that, like other Orthomyxoviruses, the NP of IDV is actively translocated to the nucleus during viral replication [37, 38] . Combined, these results demonstrate that IDV is able to replicate efficiently in hAEC cultures from different donors at temperatures corresponding to both the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans.",

After 48 hpi, we collected the apical wash of P2 and made a 10-fold diluted that was sub-passaged upon na\u00efve hAEC cultures of the same donor (P3). As before, we performed these experiments at both 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C to assess whether there are temperature dependent effects. We monitored the production of viral progeny at 48 and 96 hpi for each of the passages. In the first passage (P2), viral RNA was detected at 48 hpi and increased with one order of magnitude at 96 hpi ( Figure 1I ). However, we observed that the viral RNA yield at 37 \u2022 C was approximately one order lower in the first round compared to the viral RNA yield at 33 \u2022 C, while at 96 hpi this difference slightly reduced. Interestingly, no difference between the different incubation temperatures was observed in the final passage (P3) ( Figure 1J ). Also, no pronounced differences were observed in the viral titers between the different temperatures or passage numbers at 96 hpi ( Figure 1J) . However, at 48 hpi, we only detect infectious virus in the apical wash from the last passaging experiment that was performed at 37 \u2022 C (P3; Figure 1J ). These results show that the viral progeny from the initial experiments on well-differentiated hAEC cultures is infectious and that IDV can be serial-passaged on hAEC cultures from different donors at both 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C. To assess if IDV viral progeny is infectious, hAEC cultures were inoculated with tenfold-diluted apical wash of passage 1 virus that was serial-passaged, for two consecutive passages, upon na\u00efve hAEC cultures. The monitored viral RNA yield is given as genomic equivalents (GE) per 2 \u00b5L of isolated RNA (y-axis) at indicated hours post-inoculation (x-axis) for each of the conditions (I).

Because of this property and the structural similarity between the HEF of IDV and ICV, we wondered how IDV replication efficiency relates to ICV in our well-differentiated hAEC cultures [16] . To address this question, we first sought to limit any potential experimental variance between the readout of the viral titers. This was done by calibrating the virus stock production and viral titration of ICV (C/Johannesburg/1/66) and IDV (D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013) on a single cell line, namely HRT-18G. For the direct comparison of both viruses we inoculated well-differentiated hAEC cultures of two human donors with 10,000 TCID 50 of ICV or IDV and incubated the cultures at both 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C. This was done to determine whether there are any temperature-dependent replication kinetic differences between ICV and IDV. The viral replication kinetics were monitored as before, by collecting apical washes every 24 h, however this time for a duration of 120 h instead of 72. This was done because previously we only observed minor replication kinetic difference for IDV between 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C. We observed that, after removing the inoculum and extensive washing, the viral RNA yield increases over time for both viruses at 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C ( Figure 3A) . However, during the first 24 h the viral RNA yield of ICV is approximately a 1-1.5 order of magnitude higher compared to IDV, but in the end reaches the same plateau level ( Figure 3A ). For both viruses, the viral RNA yield plateau at 33 \u2022 C is approximately one order of magnitude higher compared to 37 \u2022 C ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, when we analyzed the viral titer of the corresponding samples, a gradual increase can be observed for ICV that reaches a plateau at 72 h. In contrast to ICV, we observed a steep increase at both 33 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C for IDV that reaches a plateau between 72-96 hpi. The steep increase results in a pronounced difference of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude difference in the production of infectious progeny virus between ICV and IDV ( Figure 3B ). This difference seems to be independent of the incubation temperature and clearly demonstrates that IDV replication on well-differentiated hAEC cultures is more efficient compared to ICV ( Figure 3B ).",

Therefore, we formalin-fixed the infected hAEC cultures to determine the cell tropism for both viruses via immunostaining. To discriminate between the ciliated and non-ciliated cell types, we used well-defined antibodies to visualize the cilia (\u03b2-tubulin IV) and tight junction borders (Zonula occludens-1, ZO-1). We used our IDV-NP-antibody for detection of IDV-infected cells, whereas for ICV we used the commercially available pooled human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). We used IVIg since most people have encountered one or multiple ICV infections during their life and therefore this likely contains antibodies directed to ICV [39, 40] . This we corroborated by an hemagglutination inhibition assay using IVIg ( Figure S2 ). By overlaying the different cellular marker stains with that of the virus antigen, we observed that for both ICV and IDV the virus-antigen signal overlaps with that of the ciliated cell marker ( Figure 3C,D) .",

The majority of antigen-positive cells for both IDV and ICV overlapped with the ciliated cell marker with an overall percentage of 97.3 and 95.5, respectively ( Figure 3E ). This is in line with our initial observation and shows that both IDV and ICV have a predominant preference for ciliated cells. In addition to the cellular tropism, we also calculated the overall infection rate for IDV and ICV, which is 4.3% and 3.3%, respectively.

These barriers can be classified into three major groups; (i) viral entry through availability of the cellular receptor and proteases, (ii) viral replication and subversion of the host innate immune system followed by (iii) viral egress and release of infectious progeny virus. Our results clearly demonstrate that IDV fulfils most of these criteria for humans, as there is no fundamental restriction for viral replication and the sequential propagation of IDV within well-differentiated hAEC cultures from different donors did not lead to major genetic changes. Since only a single non-synonymous mutation was detected in the HEF protein among multiple samples. It is possible that this non-synonymous mutation results in some advantageous adaptation for the virus, however, since there is currently no reverse genetic system available for IDV, we cannot assess its functional relevance in our model at this time. Furthermore, we cannot assess whether IDV can be transmitted between humans with our model. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that IDV can be transmitted between both guinea pigs and ferrets, of which the latter is a surrogate model for assessing the transmission potential of emerging Influenza A viruses among humans [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . This knowledge in combination with the detection of IDV in aerosols collected at an international airport, and the limited epidemiological data of IDV prevalence among humans, warrants the need for increased surveillance of IDV among humans [19, 20] .",

However, in our experiments we observed that ICV replicates efficiently in well-differentiated hAEC cultures at temperatures corresponding to both the upper and lower respiratory tract, albeit with a lower efficiency at 37 \u2022 C. This suggests that ICV in humans can replicate at lower regions in respiratory tract, which is in accordance with the detection of ICV in patients with lower respiratory tract infection [47] . Our results suggest that this is also possible for IDV that even had a higher replication efficiency at both temperatures in comparison to ICV. Similar observations have recently been made in undifferentiated primary nasal turbinate, tracheal and lung epithelial cells [48] . Nevertheless, whether the observed viral replication kinetics for ICV and IDV in our human in vitro surrogate model of the in vivo respiratory epithelium is recapitulated in those of swine and bovine origin remains to be evaluated. Especially, since both viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with respiratory infections in swine and cattle [1, 2, 49, 50] . Furthermore, it is interestingly to note that in an experimental in vivo setting IDV can be found in both the upper and lower regions of the respiratory tract of cattle, whereas ICV has thus far only been detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from the upper respiratory tract of cattle [11, 49] . Therefore, it would be interesting to assess to which extend the different ambient temperatures in the upper and lower respiratory tract of both swine and cattle influences the viral replication efficiency of both ICV and IDV.",

We have shown that both viruses have a predominant affinity towards ciliated cells, suggesting that the distribution of this type of sialic acid is limited to ciliated cells within our in vitro model. This tropism is similar to what we previously observed for the human coronavirus OC43, from which it has been reported to also utilize the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as receptor determinant [51, 52] . Nonetheless, whether this cell tropism for both IDV and ICV corresponds to that of the in vivo airway epithelium remains to be determined. Although, we previously have demonstrated that the well-differentiated hAEC cultures recapitulates many characteristics of the in vivo airway epithelium, including receptor distribution [51, 53] .",
