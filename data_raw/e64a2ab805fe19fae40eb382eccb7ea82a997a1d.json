In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting.

Important advances have been made in diverse aspects of leptospirosis including the differential host responses to leptospiral infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Despite these advances, mechanistic details by which end organ damage develops in some individuals but not in others remain to be elucidated. Further, factors that govern host susceptibility to leptospiral infection are not well understood. A recent study by our collaborative group found that approximately 6% of randomly sampled individuals in a highly endemic rural Amazonian village were chronically colonized by Leptospira without any recent clinical evidence of infection [10] . Although renal colonization by leptospires may occur in humans without serological or clinical evidence of infection, the clinical relevance and functional consequences of leptospiral colonization in humans remain to be characterized. New, less invasive, less expensive and more practical tools (compared to kidney biopsy) are needed to study pathologic changes in the kidney in order to understand clinically relevant sequelae of infection. In this report, we use proteomic analysis of urine exosomes in a rat chronic colonization model as a non-invasive window to kidney function in asymptomatic leptospiral infection.",

The following criteria were used for the identification of peptide sequences and related proteins: trypsin as enzyme; three missed cleavages per peptide were allowed and mass tolerances of \u00b1 50 ppm for precursor ions and \u00b1 0.8 Da for fragment ions were used. Validation based on separate target and decoy searches and subsequent calculation of classical score-based false discovery rates (FDR) were used for assessing the statistical significance of the identifications. Finally, to assign a final score to proteins, the SEQUEST output data were filtered as follows: 1,5; 2.0; 2.25 and 2.5 were chosen as minimum values of correlation score (Xcorr) for single-; double-; triple-and quadrupole-charged ions, respectively. A high stringency was guaranteed using parameters previously described [18] and the false-positive peptide ratio, calculated through a reverse database, was less than 3%.

A total of 842 proteins were detected, with further classification of subgroups in the infected animals based on gender as shown in Panel B of Fig. 1 . In total, 842 proteins were identified from the total urine animals with distribution as shown in Fig. 1 Panel A and B) . Importantly, 180 proteins and 272 proteins were unique to the urines of female and male rats infected with L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni respectively, as compared to 156 proteins unique to the uninfected rat urines. These differences in the composition and quantity of proteins from infected and uninfected rats potentially indicates the reactions induced in these animals by leptospiral infection. The identity of each of these proteins is as given in S1 Table. Urine exosomes from Leptospira-colonized rats show different protein constitution compared to uninfected control rats Given that the urine exosomes reflect intracellular milieu of all types of various cells lining the nephron in kidney, and emerging evidence from literature that kidney functional alterations are induced due to leptospiral infection, we next focused on exosomes. We found that a total of 204 exosome proteins were identified classifiable into 7 different groups as noted in S2a-S2g Table and summarized in the Venn diagram (Panel C, Fig. 1 ). The exosome protein constitution also showed increase in the number of proteins expressed in the exosome, viz 32 proteins uniquely present in the uninfected exosome versus 57 unique proteins in the infected rat exosome.",

The graph represents relative contribution of proteins to the variance between the Leptospira-infected and uninfected control rat urine exosomes. High value of VIP score indicates great contribution of the proteins to the group separation. The green and red boxes on the right indicate whether the protein concentration is increased (green) or decreased (red) in the exosome of the infected rat urine vs. uninfected rat urine samples. For higher n value, a VIP score of 1.5 is considered to enable discrimination between 2 phenotypes. Even with the low n (= 3) per group that is employed in this study, the VIP score of the top 3 proteins is higher than 3, increasing the confidence. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also called CD13 is the top protein with a VIP score of 5.72. indicates a specific consequence of leptospiral infection of the organ of leptospiral transmission and provides an important rationale for pursuing such studies in humans that will allow for further understanding of the clinical and biological consequences of chronic renal colonization. Finally, although renal tubular involvement in leptospiral infection has been well-documented, this study is the first to report increased CD13 and decreased Tamm-Horsfall Protein in infection. Although apparently intuitive and in agreement with the published literature in regard to renal tubular involvement in leptospirosis infection, the biological and clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined further.",

Previous work has demonstrated expression of CD13/ APN on intestinal and kidney epithelial cell brush border [25, [49] [50] [51] [52] . CD13 is an ectoenzyme with a multitude of functions: (a). enzymatic cleavage of various peptides such as enkephalins, angiotensins or cytokines [53, 54] and their biologic process regulation [55] ; (b). marker of differentiation for multiple types of immune cells [56, 57] and stem cells [58] ; (c). various cellular processes such as proliferation [59] and apoptosis [60] , motility [61] , chemotaxis [62] ; (d). critical role in immunogenic, inflammatory and infection pathways such as antigen processing [63, 64] and presentation [65] , and phagocytosis in defense against pathogens [66] , viral receptor on the host cell surface and the subsequent endocytosis of viruses into cell interior [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . Soluble CD13/APN that circulates in the serum is repeatedly reported to be upregulated at inflammation sites [55, 72] . Since CD13 represents a cellular potential for activation or inactivation of inflammatory peptides, modulation of its expression by different agents and stimuli may affect inflammatory and immunologic responses [64, 73] and antigen processing [63] [64] [65] .",

            "text": "Recent evidence [56] shows that CD13 is a multifunctional enzyme with at least 3 different types of activities: (a) peptide cleavage, (b) endocytosis, and (c) signaling. In light of our proteomic data which shows robust and reproducible CD13 upregulation in response to leptospirosis infection, it is possible that either one or all three of these CD13 functionalities are employed. Future studies should further delineate how much or if these functions play a role in mediating specific components of host response to leptospirosis infection. This multifunctional property notwithstanding, so far, CD13/APN activity or its upregulation has not been described specifically in the context of Leptospira infection. Nevertheless, relevant to our current findings, a role for the upregulation of APN expression and activity in the membrane is conceivable, and the following features / properties lend this multifunctional enzyme to potentially play a role in Leptospira infection/invasion: the viral receptor function of APN [52, 69, 74] either requires or results in its internalization [55, 71] . Previously, the APN/CD13 molecule has been shown to be the predominant component of the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) microdomains, also called lipid rafts [71] . CD13/APN is shown to play a critical role in appropriate membrane reorganization and protein distribution after a major reshuffling event [75] , and is itself is shown to be localized in lipid rafts of the cell membranes [76, 77] and endocytosed through physiological sorting mechanisms [57] . At the time of these reports, the concept of exosomes was not as well-established as it is now. The course taken by regular physiologic endocytosis during internalization of specific viruses [69] , the role of CD13/APN as the cellular receptor to facilitate this internalization [70] and its critical dependency on the early edosome-formation [71] and subsequent intracellular sub-plasma membrane molecular events bear close resemblance to the formation of exosomes in the renal tubular epithelial cell and their release into urine, the extracellular milieu modeled by the Knepper group [78] . Our proteomic data shows that APN is the most consistently and significantly upregulated protein molecule on the urine exosome of the infected rat. Renal tubular brush border involvement in leptospirosis infection has been well established in animal models showing leptospiral antigen expression in parallel to kidney changes both by light microscopy and electron microscopy examination [79, 80] . Further reinforcement of this view comes from the recent evidence that during phagocytosis, CD13 redistribution to phagosome and further internalization increases the efficiency of the process of phagocytosis.",

APN located on the plasma membrane of the renal tubular epithelium brush border would be upregulated due to Leptospira infection; Though its exact mechanism and its details remain to be elucidated, taken together with the literature our data suggest that APN release from brush border via exosomes in infectious condition, may have been part of the host immune response to leptospiral infection, since it is well-established that exosomes are generated from membranes via endocytic mechanisms [81] and further, that under stress, the exosome cargo changes qualitatively [12, 13] . However, if leptospiral infection directly causes increased APN packaging into exosome and its subsequent release needs to be addressed in future. It is plausible that due to the stress of leptospiral infection, renal tubular epithelium mediated exosome packaging is qualitatively altered to include APN. We also found that female rats' response to Leptospira infection is markedly different from that of the male rat. This has important implications and is relevant from the viewpoint of our finding that among asymptomatic human carriers of Leptospira, male and female subjects show different phenotypes [10] . However see below, details on the limitations of using or extrapolating the chronic rodent model to an acute infection or a different species such as humans.",

Therefore we tested the hypothesis that the expression of the most abundant protein in the normal healthy urine, Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) that is exclusively synthesized in renal tubules should be affected in Leptospira infected rats. THP (also called uromodulin) is secreted by the epithelium of thick ascending loop of Henle and the early portion of the distal tubules [82] . One of the phenotypes that a THP knockout mouse model develops is the increased susceptibility to urinary tract infection caused by bacteria [83, 84] . THP is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein released from epithelial apical membranes (approximately 120 kDa.) into the tubule fluid by membrane associated phospholipase C [85, 86] . Free (urinary) THP has a monomeric weight of approximately 85 kDa with 30% carbohydrate. Our data (Fig. 6) shows that THP expression is reduced in all infected rats. Taken together with the previous work, our data strongly indicate that the tubular epithelial component responsible for THP-synthesis and expression is severely compromised in leptospirosis.",

            "text": "This study design had several limitations. First, the rat model used for our studies is the chronic infection animal model whereas human leptospirosis infection often results in acute infection episodes and often death. The elements of either acute leptospiral infection animal model or human leptospiral infection may yield very different results from those obtained for the model reported here. Even the direction of up/down regulation of significantly different proteins need not necessarily be the same as these chronic animal model findings. However, the methodology that we have employed here namely exosomal analysis, can be eminently applied to study any other model including the acute phases of leptospiral infection in humans or to test the hypothesis that acute infection results in differences in the urine exosome that can be tracked and understood. Secondly, the number of animals analyzed per group is small, reflecting the intensity of this large scale analysis. A higher n value per condition may have increased the robustness of these data further and brought the CD13 differences between uninfected and infected female rats too, to an acceptable FDR of <10%. However this small value of n notwithstanding, these data as such are robust. The difference in protein numbers between infected and uninfected rat urine exosome is remarkably large that it imparted the highest VIP score to CD13. Thirdly, some of the other proteins that feature lower VIP score may have had higher VIP scores by increasing the number of animals. This potentially would have increased our knowledge of what other novel pathways are selected/employed by either leptospires or the host. Finally, we used 1d gel electrophoresis to resolve the exosome proteins prior to LC/MS-MS analysis that resulted in identification of 204 proteins overall. If we had conducted direct exosome protein trypsinization instead of following this method, perhaps the number of identified proteins might have increased. In our experience, exosomes are packaged with non-full length peptides as well, and may have confounded the analysis. By following the gel electrophoresis method, we ensured that we only compare full length protein differences between animals.",

Work from the Knepper group shows that many important renal proteins (e.g. aquaporins, polycystins and podocyn) are shed in the urine exosome [87, 88] . Our current report adds APN to this group of functionally important renal proteins to be identified in urine exosomes. Our findings suggest that the host response to Leptospira infection is gender-specific, and involves renal tubular elements. This report potentially forms the preliminary level basis for our overarching hypothesis that changes in the kidney function as a result of an external insult can be determined using urine exosome analyses.",

Non-invasive: it would be ideal to biopsy every infected individual to understand the various facets of leptospirosis infection in order that our knowledge about Leptospira increases. However, it is neither practical nor ethical, given the invasive nature. Urine exosome analyses is non-invasive, highly specific and provides a window into the organ level structural or functional changes. If implemented quickly enough in a translational research setting, this specificity potentially imparts ability to move the field towards personalized medicine.",

Gender-specific host responses to disease onset: our data shows that this methodology of studying differences between male and female host response to infection can be applied in the setting of human disease. Although we should expect different molecules other than CD13 to by dysregulated, the individual-specific pathways mediating different magnitude responses to the same infection can be accurately measured using exosome markers that are either surrogately or directly linked to a particular host-response event. This assumes importance especially in the setting of sub-clinical leptospirosis infection where in the patient does not display any clinical features/symptoms but continues to play host to the bacterium.",

Briefly, this was performed using an Opticon 2 real-time PCR machine (MJ Research, USA). The assay protocol was modified from the published version (2) by using the fluorescent probe at a final concentration of 0.2 mM, primers at a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and a 20 mL reaction volume (3). Standard curves for quantification were made using Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain M20. Standards were prepared as follows. Leptospires were counted using a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber (Hauser Scientific, USA) and serially diluted with sterile double-distilled H2O to 108 to 100 leptospires/ ml. Genomic DNA was subsequently prepared using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, USA). Standards were run in triplicate to generate a standard curve with each run. A negative result was assigned where no amplification occurred before 40 cycles. Controls lacking template were extracted and added to qPCR master mix to detect the presence of contaminating DNA. The raw data is shown in S3 Table.

The graph represents relative contribution of proteins to the variance between the Leptospira-infected and uninfected control rat urine exosomes. High value of VIP score indicates great contribution of the proteins to the group separation. The green and red boxes on the right indicate whether the protein concentration is increased (green) or decreased (red) in the exosome of the infected rat urine vs. uninfected rat urine samples. For higher n value, a VIP score of 1.5 is considered to enable discrimination between 2 phenotypes. Even with the low n (= 3) per group that is employed in this study, the VIP score of the top 3 proteins is higher than 3, increasing the confidence. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also called CD13 is the top protein with a VIP score of 5.72.",
