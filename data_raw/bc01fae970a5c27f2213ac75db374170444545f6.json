Camelus dromedarius is welladapted to survive in extreme desert climate and it has GSTs, for which limited information is available. This study investigated the structure-function and thermodynamic properties of a mu-class camel GST (CdGSTM1) at different pH. Recombinant CdGSTM1 (25.7 kDa) was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Dimeric CdGSTM1 dissociated into stable but inactive monomeric subunits at low pH. Conformational and thermodynamic changes during the thermal unfolding pathway of dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1 were characterised via a thermal shift assay and dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS). The thermal shift assay based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed that CdGSTM1 underwent a two-state unfolding pathway at pH 1.0-10.0. Its Tm value varied with varying pH. Another orthogonal technique based on far-UV CD also exhibited two-state unfolding in the dimeric and monomeric states. Generally, proteins tend to lose structural integrity and stability at low pH; however, monomeric CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 was thermally more stable and unfolded with lower van't Hoff enthalpy. The present findings provide essential information regarding the structural, functional, and thermodynamic properties of CdGSTM1 at pH 1.",

Modeled 3D structure of CdGSTM1 was superimposed on hGSTM1A-1A (Fig 1B) , indicated a high degree of similarity. eliminate impurities and GSH (Fig 2A) . A single sharp peak was observed at 70 mL of eluted volume which is indicated that the fractions contained a homogenous population of dimeric CdGSTM1. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was also performed to confirm the level of CdGSTM1 homogeneity (purity). SDS-PAGE revealed a single band at~26 kDa, thereby confirming that CdGSTM1 was highly pure (Fig 2A inset) . The yield of soluble, pure CdGSTM1 protein was approximately 30 mg L -1 in a shake-flask culture. The quaternary structure of the purified protein was determined using an analytical Superdex 200 column. CdGSTM1 was eluted at a volume of 15.3 mL, which corresponds to approximately 50.58 kDa which, is similar to the calculated molecular weight (51.5 kDa) of dimeric CdGSTM1 (Fig 2B) .",

The primary intrinsic fluorophores in proteins are tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Total fluorescence spectra of CdGSTM1 at different pHs are shown in Fig 4. From the figure, it was recorded that the CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 showed maximum fluorescence intensity at 336 nm, confirming that CdGSTM1 exists in a well-folded form. The fluorescence emission maximum of CdGSTM1 remained unchanged in the range of 5.0-9.0 pH, indicating that the tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 was intact (Fig 4, inset) . However, between pH 3.0 and 5.0, the wavelength maximum of CdGSTM1 was 6.0 nm (red shifted). The red shift in the wavelength maximum signified that the tryptophan residues were exposed to the polar environment, thus indicating changes in protein tertiary structure. Moreover, the maximum wavelength remained unchanged below pH 3.0, indicating that the same microenvironment around tryptophan residues was retained. Fluorescence intensity of CdGSTM1 increased gradually with a reduction in pH because the position of certain amino acid residues changed apart from the Trp residues, which were responsible for quenching of Trp fluorescence. Such pH-dependent changes were also reported previously [42] . The shift in maximum wavelength suggests that dimeric CdGSTM1 either begins monomerising below pH 5.0 or undergoes a loss of tertiary structure interactions, which were further characterized by other advance techniques.",

Far-UV CD spectra of CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 yielded two negative minima, one at 208 and the other at 222 nm, which is a characteristic feature of an alpha helix ( Fig 5A) . Changes in the negative ellipticity of CdGSTM1 at 208 and 222 nm were insignificant at pH 1.0-10.0. CDNN analysis revealed that percent secondary structure contents (alpha-helical, beta-sheet, beta-turn, and random coil) of CdGSTM1 were not significantly altered with changes in pH ( Fig 5B) .

Intrinsic and ANS fluorescence analyses revealed that camel CdGSTM1 undergoes a sharp transition between pH 3.0 and 5.0, probably owing to pH-dependent monomerisation or partial unfolding. Therefore, gel-permeation chromatography was performed to distinguish the level of monomerisation at ; Fig 7) . At pH 7.0, CdGSTM1 was eluted at a single symmetrical peak (blue), corresponding with its dimeric state (Fig 2B) . When CdGSTM1 was equilibrated at pH 4.0 (pink), gel-permeation chromatograms revealed two peaks, one at 16.3 mL and the other at 25.9 mL, indicating that two types of populations were obtained: one with the size of the dimeric state; the other, the monomeric state. CdGSTM1 incubated at pH 2.0 yielded peaks at 22.2 and 25.9 mL similar to those of the monomeric state (black). Gel-permeation chromatography revealed that above pH 5.0, CdGSTM1 exists in its dimeric form; however, between pH 3.0 and 5.0, it exists in a monomeric-dimeric equilibrium and below pH 3.0, it exists only in the monomeric form.",

The samples of CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 7.0 before and after gel filtration were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. The cross-linked products of CdGSTM1 before ( Fig 8A) and after ( Fig 8B) CdGSTM1 at different pH was loaded on a 24-mL bed volume Superdex 200 column to separate monomer-dimer species of CdGSTM1. At pH 2.0, CdGSTM1 was dissociated and eluted at two peaks (22.2 and 25.9 mL). Although 150 mM NaCl was added in the gel filtration buffer to suppress protein-matrix interactions, CdGSTM1at pH 2.0 was retained in the column and eluted near the column bed volume. Similarly, CdGSTM1 at pH 4.0, where it exits in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, eluted at two peaks. The dimer eluted at the expected peak (16.3 mL), followed by the monomeric form after crossing the bed volume owing to retention in the matrix. All elution peaks obtained at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 7.0 were separately subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linkage ( Fig 8B) . The first peak at pH 2.0 displayed cross-linkage in the monomeric form (lane 1) and the second peak was very small and showed a faint band ",

The temperature-melting curves of the samples were obtained through gradual heating at a constant rate of 1\u02daC min -1 . CdGSTM1 formed visible aggregates above 75\u02daC between pH 5.0 and 10.0. However, below pH 3.0, no aggregates were observed up to 94\u02daC. Therefore, CdGSTM1 samples between pH 5.0 and 10.0 were gradually heated till 70\u02daC and samples below pH 3.0 were subjected to thermal denaturation till 94\u02daC. The emission ratio of 350 nm to 330 nm was plotted with respect to temperature at the different pH values (Fig 10) . The ratio of 350/330 nm was clustered in two groups owing to a shift in \u03bb max (6-nm red-shift) at pH 3.0. CdGSTM1 undergoes a single thermal transition at all pHs. The tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 undergoes thermal denaturation via a two-state unfolding pathway at all pH values (Fig 10) . In this study, thermal stability of CdGSTM1 was moderate between pH 1.0 and 10.0 ( Table 2) . CdGSTM1 was relatively more stable at an acidic pH than at neutral and alkaline pH. Exceptionally high stability (65.2\u02daC) at pH 3.0 might have resulted from monomer-dimer equilibrium.",

Therefore, the dimeric form (pH 7.0) and monomeric form (pH 2.0) of CdGSTM1 were subjected to dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS) to evaluate structural and thermodynamic properties in both states. The samples at pH 7.0 were constantly heated (1\u02daC min -1 ) from 20-75\u02daC, while the sample at pH 2.0 was heated up to 94\u02daC under identical conditions. Far-UV CD spectra of both samples were recorded between 200 and 260 nm as a function of temperature. Selected wavelengths are shown in Fig 11. Dimeric CdGSTM1 (pH 7.0) and monomeric CdHSTM1 (pH 2.0) unfold via a single transition. At pH 7.0, they undergo sharp thermal transitions and secondary structure is completely lost at 57\u02daC, while CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 follows shallow thermal transition and retains nearly half of the secondary structure up to 94\u02daC. The thermal melting points (Tm) and van't Hoff enthalpy of CdGSTM1 at both pHs were determined via Global 3 analysis software, Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK. The Tm of dimeric CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 was 51.5 \u00b1 0.1\u02daC and van't Hoff enthalpy was 666.4 \u00b1 9.8 kJ mol -1 . The Tm of monomeric CdGSTM1 was higher 54.2 \u00b1 0.1\u02daC; however, the van't Hoff enthalpy was quite low (116.5 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol -1 ). The thermal shift assay also yielded a single thermal transition with Tm values of 49.0 and 54.8\u02daC at pH 7.0 and 2.0, respectively (Fig 10) .",

During thermal unfolding beyond 45\u02daC, a 222-nm peak shifted towards single a 225-nm peak (Fig 12A) . Thermal stress at pH 7.0 led to the conversion of CdGSTM1 from an alpha helical structure into a cross-beta sheeted structure, which aggregated beyond 75\u02daC [45] . However, thermal denaturation of monomeric CdGSTM1 led to the conversion of the same alpha-helical structure to a random-coil structure (Fig 12B) . Hence, monomeric CdGSTM1 slowly loses its secondary structure beyond 30\u02daC but retains nearly half of its secondary structure even up to 94\u02daC. Thereafter, we measured the reversibility of thermal unfolding in dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1. As shown in Fig 13, dimeric CdGSTM1 at 20\u02daC is an alpha-helical protein, which has completely lost its secondary structure at 75\u02daC. Moreover, heat-denatured dimeric CdGSTM1 could not refold. Monomeric CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 was also alpha-helical at 20\u02daC, but converted into a completely reversible random-coiled dominant structure at 94\u02daC.

It has been extensively used as a spectral probe to investigate protein tertiary structure [55] . Generally, interior tryptophan residues in folded proteins displayed fluorescence emission maximum below 340 nm, whereas upon protein unfolding, the fluorescence emission maximum red-shifted to 350-355 nm. CdGSTM1 contains four tryptophan residues. A 3D model of CdGSTM1 revealed that two of these (Trp8 and Trp46) are located proximal to the dimer interface (data not shown). The emission maximum of CdGSTM1 at neutral pH was observed at 336 nm (Fig 4) , suggesting that the tryptophan residues in the native conformation are significantly buried in the protein core. The tryptophan emission maxima were mostly unchanged from pH 5.0 to 10.0, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the protein was stable in this pH range (Fig 4) . However, a sharp red-shift (6 nm) in the intrinsic emission maxima was observed between pH 3.0 and 5.0, with no further change in emission maxima below pH 3.0 (Fig 4) . The red-shift in emission maxima resulted from changes in the tryptophan microenvironment from a non-polar to a polar environment during protein denaturation or dissociation of subunits of multimeric proteins or both [55] . A minor shift in emission maxima (from 336 to 342 nm) of CdGSTM1 below pH 5.0 indicated a marginal change around the tryptophan residues in CdGSTM1 at low pH. On treatment with a chemical denaturant (6 M GdnHCl), CdGSTM1 undergoes complete unfolding with an emission maxima of 360 nm (data not shown).",

ANS does not bind or exhibit very low binding with the native and completely unfolded polypeptide chain; however, it binds with protein folding intermediates formed during unfolding [56] . ANS emission spectra, used to measure surface hydrophobicity, showed a blue-shift and a two-fold increase in fluorescence intensity between pH 3.0 and 5.0. Previously, ANS was found to bind the dimer interface, thereby decreasing the emission maximum from 535 nm to 490-500 nm, accompanied by an enhanced fluorescence signal [29, 30, 57] . The blue-shift in the ANS spectra revealed that the environment of the ANS-binding site is hydrophobic. RLS is routinely used to detect the quantity of aggregates in a solution [58, 59] .

Thermal melting curves based on changes in the tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 revealed that it follows twostate thermal unfolding at pH 1.0 to 10.0. The protein was moderately thermostable, and its thermostability increased significantly below pH 3.0. Thermal stability based on secondary structure (far-UV CD) also had similar Tm values and temperature-induced unfolding pathways of dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1 compared to those obtained with the thermal shift assay [62] . The present results show that dimeric CdGSTM1 undergoes a sharp thermal transition with a large change in van't Hoff enthalpy (666.4 \u00b1 9.8 kJ mol -1 ), while the monomeric form undergoes broad range of thermal transitions (approximately 40\u02daC) with lower van't Hoff enthalpy 116.5 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol -1 . Dimeric CdGSTM1 attains cross-beta sheeted structures during thermal unfolding, which undergoes irreversible thermal aggregation. However, alpha helices in monomeric CdGSTM1 were gradually converted to random-coil-like structures during thermal unfolding, which was completely reversible.

            "text": "Understanding protein stability is necessary to gain insights into protein folding, structure, and function. Proteins that are marginally stabilized exceed a minimal threshold to attain a native conformation and function [63, 64] . Generally, thermodynamic stabilities of most water-soluble globular proteins varies from 12 and 42 kJ/mol [64] . The protein is stabilized via a delicate balance between certain forces and interactions. Hydrophobic forces and electrostatic interactions are major factors determining protein stability. To balance optimum biological function and conformational stability, electrostatic interactions are optimised in proteins [65] . Analysis of pH-dependent protein stability helps understand electrostatic interactions in proteins and the contribution of specific charged residues in protein structure and function. The thermodynamic stability of proteins in the native and denatured state are linked to pKa groups of the side chains, which is pH-dependent. The pKa values of the residues in the native and unfolded states depend on several factors: charge-charge, H-bonds, charge-dipole, and desolvation effects. The degree of interactions between charged resides and the rest of the protein in the native or denatured forms determines the titration properties of the ionisable groups. Generally, proteins lose structure-function and stability below pH 5.0 and above pH 10.0 owing to ionization of buried ionisable residues (e.g., Tyr, His) in the folded native state. In the strong acidic or alkaline region, ionisable residues from the surface to the core of the proteins gradually get ionized and lead to protein unfolding. The relatively higher stability of monomeric CdGSTM1 compared to that of dimeric CdGSTM may have resulted from higher intra-chain interactions within the monomer. The overall data is schematically presented in Fig 14. Briefly, CdGSTM1 exists in dimeric state at pH 7.0 while it equilibrated in dimermonomer form at pH 4.0. At acidic pH of 2.0, it is populated in monomeric form. The dimeric form was having relatively less thermal stability than the monomeric form. ",
