            "text": "Mathematical modelling has helped to unravel some of the complexities of asymptomatic carriage and its implications for control [9, [12] [13] [14] . For example, modelling studies of influenza [13] and communityassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [14] found that control strategies targeting symptomatically infected hosts but not asymptomatic carriers are actually incapable of achieving disease control, even when multiple control types are implemented. Modelling has also revealed the importance of accounting for asymptomatic carriers in epidemiological models. For example, under certain conditions, neglecting pre-symptomatic influenza transmission was shown to overestimate the impact of interventions targeting symptomatically infected hosts [12] . Neglecting asymptomatic carriers in a model of Ebola virus transmission was shown to significantly overestimate the projected cumulative incidence of symptomatic infections, as well as overestimate the population-level vaccination coverage needed to contain epidemics [9] . Accordingly, if carriage is not appropriately represented in mathematical models, there is a risk that they may incorrectly assess the viability of an intervention, potentially leading to missed opportunities for controlling disease or, conversely, the implementation of an ineffective intervention. Therefore, without sufficient knowledge of asymptomatic carriers the parametrization and validation of mathematical models is compromised. More fundamentally, this uncertainty also undermines the choice of model used to represent the transmission and natural history of an infectious disease, as evidenced by the variation in model structure observed across mathematical modelling studies of MRSA [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This uncertainty in the underlying structure of mathematical models of infectious diseases with asymptomatic carriers casts further doubt on evaluations of interventions from mathematical models, potentially hindering the decision-making process of policy-makers.",

To address this need, here we review existing mathematical models of infectious disease transmission for the purpose of identifying the types of model structures that are used to describe transmission with asymptomatic carriers. Based on this review, we define a new model of pathogen transmission that enables us to systematically compare the behaviour of alternative model structures and how they influence the estimated impact of control interventions. First, we analyse this model to establish the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to measures of pathogen transmission, the prevalence of symptomatic infections and the total infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) prevalence. We then consider how excluding asymptomatic carriers from this model could lead to the misinterpretation of data and the conditions under which this obscures the most important drivers of pathogen transmission. Finally, we evaluate the impact of a range of interventions on transmission and the prevalence of disease, and discuss how the choice of model structure might affect the assessment of these interventions.",

Examples of this type of intervention are the multivalent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines. These vaccines only protect against about 10% of this pathogen's 90 identified serotypes. Those included in the vaccine are selected for their predominance as causes of invasive pneumococcal disease, allowing less virulent (carriage) strains to persist [23] , essentially reducing the relative incidence of symptomatic infections versus asymptomatic carriage. Our study provides a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of models that include asymptomatic carriers, will inform more appropriate design of future models and contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of asymptomatic carriage on pathogen dynamics.",

We identified 23 generic models that differed according to flows representing transmission events (leading to asymptomatic infection: S \u2192 C, or symptomatic infection: S \u2192 I), flows representing a change in infection state (disease regression: I \u2192 C, disease progression: C \u2192 I), and flows corresponding to clearance of the pathogen (from asymptomatic infection: C \u2192 S or R, from symptomatic infection: I \u2192 S or R).

We also consider interventions that change \u03b7 (e.g. by quarantining symptomatic infectives), \u03b3 (e.g. through a mass drug administration), \u03be (e.g. by treating only symptomatic cases), \u03c9 (e.g. by providing treatment that targets symptoms, not pathogen clearance), \u03c4 (e.g. by improving sanitation) and \u03b1 (e.g. through a vaccine targeting pathogen strains associated with symptomatic infection, allowing carriage strains to persist). First, we determine whether the slope of R 0 (and thus the slope ofP because it is an increasing function of R 0 ) in the direction of any of these model parameters switches from being positive to negative as other parameters in the model are changed. If a switch in the slope of R 0 in the direction of one of these parameters is possible, then there is a risk that the corresponding intervention will be predicted to either reduce or increase transmission but lead to the opposite effect if estimates of other model parameters are inaccurate.",

For parameters controlling the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (x \u2208 {\u03c9, \u03c4 , \u03b1}), the reproduction potential of carriers A determines whether or not condition (3.14) holds true.

For parameters controlling the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (x \u2208 {\u03c9, \u03c4 , \u03b1}), the reproduction potential again plays a key role in determining whether \u2202P I /\u2202x > 0 holds true. When A < 1, decreasing the relative frequency of appearance of symptomatic infectives (by decreasing \u03c4 or \u03b1, or increasing \u03c9) will Overall, our analyses highlight how the relative reproduction potential of carriers A largely determines the effects of interventions on a pathogen's basic reproduction number R 0 , total endemic prevalenceP and the endemic prevalence of diseaseP I , when interventions are designed to alter the relative frequency of appearance of asymptomatic carriers (i.e. change \u03c4 , \u03c9 and \u03b1).",

            "text": "A key result of our study is that interventions that alter the frequency of symptomatically infected hosts can lead to unintuitive outcomes in the presence of asymptomatic carriers. Vaccines targeted against a multi-strain pathogen almost invariably target only a proportion of strains. This partial coverage has the potential to change the balance of asymptomatic to symptomatic infection episodes, with implications for population-level vaccine impact. The PCV7 Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine, for example, targeted the seven most-prevalent strains associated with invasive disease when it was first added to routine childhood vaccination schedules in various populations. Numerous studies documented the subsequent declining rates of asymptomatic carriage of PCV7 serotypes and of overall invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among young children [23, 33] , although the overall incidence of asymptomatic carriage remained relatively stable [34] . Overall reductions in the incidence of IPD were also observed in non-vaccinated adults [23, 33] , although these were accompanied by increases in the overall rates of asymptomatic carriage [34] . The mechanisms behind the extended response to the PCV7 vaccine beyond the vaccinated populations which affected childhood and adult asymptomatic carriage and IPD rates differently are not well understood. However, it has been suggested that both serotype replacement and a decrease in herd immunity from reduced exposure to asymptomatic carriers may play a role in the populationlevel impact of the PCV7 vaccine [35, 36] . Similar mechanisms are also suggested to be behind the extended response beyond the vaccinated populations to the subsequently introduced 13-valent S. pneumoniae vaccine [33] . Recently, IPD incidence has begun to increase in populations in the United Kingdom, particularly among persons 5-64 and greater than 65 years of age, and despite the everincreasing proportion of the population obtaining direct protection through vaccination [37] . Serotype replacement, in conjunction with changes to the invasiveness of the non-vaccine strains, is a possible explanation [37] .",

Accordingly, patterns of pathogen transmission may also be expected to vary between host settings. MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes, for example, have mostly commensal interactions with humans and occasionally cause symptomatic skin infections. When such pathogens are transmitted in environments with high rates of host injury (e.g. healthcare settings or regions where other contagious skin diseases like human scabies are endemic [38] ), it is conceivable that infected hosts will probably have an increased chance of developing symptoms compared to other environments with lower host-injury rates and lower chances of hosts having breakages in their skin [15] . Our analytical results suggest that different patterns of pathogen transmission may be occurring in these different host settings, and that the effect of controls may also vary across host settings.",

These communities are characterized by higher host-injury rates and poorer host health compared to communities where S. pyogenes has a much lower prevalence.

First, it applies to only those pathogens for which asymptomatic carriers are infectious, clearance of infection is possible and does not confer lifelong immunity, and infection does not alter the death rate of hosts. These restrictions mean that our results are not relevant to two of humanity's leading causes of death attributable to a single infectious agent -Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV [41] . A natural extension of our work is to consider how relaxing these constraints affects our study's conclusions to gain insight into the transmission of these important human pathogens. Second, our model assumes the homogeneous mixing of hosts and it does not consider strain diversity. However, for pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes age-assortative mixing and strain diversity are likely to be key drivers of observed transmission dynamics [36, 42] . Therefore, it is also of interest to explore the implications of asymptomatic carriage in more complex model structures. ",
