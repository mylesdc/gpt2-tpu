            "text": "To investigate bat coronaviruses (CoVs), we collected 132 rectal swabs and urine samples from five bat species in three countries in southwestern China. Seven CoVs belonging to distinct groups of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoVs and \u03b1-CoVs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats. Samples from other bat species were negative for these viruses, indicating that the least horseshoe bat represents one of the natural reservoirs and mixers for strains of CoVs and has a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses. The genetic and evolutionary characteristics of these strains were described. Whole-genome sequencing of a new isolate (F46) from a rectal swab from a least horseshoe bat showed that it contained 29 699 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic and recombination analyses of F46 provided evidence of natural recombination between bat SARS-like CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) or SARS-CoV (BJ01), suggesting that F46 could be a new recombinant virus from SARS-like CoVs or SARS-CoVs.",

            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that emerged in China in 2002-2003 is one of the most significant public health events leading to a global epidemic in the twenty-first century. 1 SARS caused more than 8000 human cases with 774 deaths. 1-3 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiologic agent of SARS. [4] [5] [6] Since then, several outbreaks, including avian influenza, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome, have emerged from animal populations causing considerable disease and mortality. 7 Investigations regarding the direct progenitor and natural reservoirs of SARS-CoVs have demonstrated that bats are the natural reservoir for several viruses that are closely related genetically to SARS-CoV, known as bat SARS-like CoVs. 8, 9 Bat SARS-like CoVs are thought to be the precursors of SARS-CoV; however, their genomes are not identical to those of SARS-CoV. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The main differences between bat SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoVs are found in the third non-structural protein (nsp3), spike protein (S), open reading frame (ORF)-3 and ORF-8 regions, which exhibit the lowest nucleotide (nt) and amino-acid (aa) identities among different parts of the genome. 8, 10, 19 Particularly in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein, which is responsible for human infection via binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bat SARS-like CoVs share only low sequence identity and contain a 19-aa deletion compared with SARS-CoVs. 19, 20, 21 These differences indicate that the known bat SARS-like CoVs are not the immediate progenitors of SARS-CoVs. 21, 22 Recently, two bat SARS-like CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) were shown to be more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat SARS-like CoV. Moreover, these CoVs contain RBDs similar to that in the SARS-CoV S protein for binding to ACE2, suggesting that they can cause direct human infection without an intermediate host. 23, 24 However, it remains unknown whether bat SARS-like CoVs that are even closer to SARS-CoV exist. Identification of the immediate progenitors of SARS-CoVs and their bat hosts will not only shed light on the animal source of SARS-CoVs but might also have implications in the formulation of strategies to prevent the reemergence of SARS-like CoVs in human.",

A total of 754 Mb of data with 397 895 reads (168-249 bp) was obtained. The CLC genomics workbench was used for sequencing data analysis. Assembly resulted in 450 contigs with lengths from 192 to 3500 bp. Following BLAST and mapping analyses, we obtained 145 viral reads (200-3217 bp) related to CoVs. De novo assembly of these sequence reads generated the complete sequences of F46, and no regions had notably lower coverage. The full length of the F46 genome is 29 699 nt (excluding the poly (A) tail) with a GC content of 41.2%. Its genome organization and coding potential appear similar to SARS-CoV SZ3 with the exception of ORF 4, which is absent from F46 but present in SZ3 ( Table 2 ). The full genome of F46 shared 91.7% to 91.8% nt identity with those of SARS-CoVs. F46 ORFs were compared with human SARS-CoV (Tor2), Civet SARS-CoV (SZ3) and five bat SARS-like CoVs (LYRa11, Rs3367, Rf1, Cp and Rp3; Table 2 ), and the results indicate that F46 is closely related to SARS-CoVs. Figure 2B ). The location of F46 in the phylogenetic tree is between LYRa11 and Rs3367, but they are distributed in relatively separate clades. F46 likely represents an intermediate between LYRa11 and Rs3367 in the evolutionary pathway. Further verification of this finding is presented below in the recombination analysis.",

Similar to counterparts in other SARS-CoVs or SARS-like CoVs, the S gene of F46 exhibited wide variation, sharing 76.3%-76.5% aa identity with SARS-CoVs and 76.5%-83.5% aa identity with bat SARS-like CoVs ( Table 2) . Spike protein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein mediates virus binding with ACE2, the functional receptor for SARS-CoV on susceptible cells. The RBD of S1 mediates receptor binding of the virus to host cells and determines the host spectrum. 29 (Figures 2A  and 3) . 31, 32 Recombination analysis CoVs commonly undergo RNA recombination between strains at high frequency. To understand the evolutionary origin and identify the Novel coronaviruses in least horseshoe bats L Wang et al recombination events of F46, we conducted a recombination analysis using RDP and available genome sequences of human/civet and bat SARS-like CoVs. Four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome, with strong P-values (o10 -30 ) supported by similarity plot and bootscan analyses (Figures 4B and 4C) . The breakpoints generated recombination of fragment A covering 1-8 and 848 nts (a total of 8 and 848 nt), including the 5\u2032-UTR and partial ORF 1a, and fragment B covering 21 684 to 23 271 nt (a total of 1587 nt), including a partial ORF of the spike gene. Both similarity plots and bootscan analyses revealed that F46 was highly phylogenetically related to SL-CoV LYRa11 in the first 9000 nt of the genome. Downstream of the first 9000 nt of the genome, F46 shared similar sequence similarity to SARS-CoV BJ01 and SL-CoV Rs3367. Phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions showed that F46 is grouped in the SL-CoVs and close to SL-CoV LYRa11 (Figures 4D and 4E) . These results indicate that F46 could be a new recombinant virus from SARS-like CoVs or SARS-CoVs.",

[33] [34] [35] [36] [37] It is believed that Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, like many other CoVs, originated in bats. 33, 34 This hypothesis proved to be true with SARS based on several studies. [35] [36] [37] [38] Recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat (references). In 2005, two independent studies identified SARSlike CoVs from bats. 20, 33 Since then, additional SARS-like CoVs in various bat species have been reported. 24, 25 Among them, horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) are the main reservoir to harbor genetically diverse SARS-like CoVs. 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, [23] [24] [25] Several of these SARS-like CoVs, such as Rs3367 and LYRa1, appear to be most closely related to SARS-CoVs and the gap-filling viruses between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoVs. 23, 24 In this study, several CoVs belonging to the groups of SARS-like CoVs and \u03b1-CoVs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats (R. pusillus). Samples from other bat species (R. luctus, R. affinis, M. daubentonii and fruit bat) were negative for these viruses, further confirming that the least horseshoe bat is a prominent natural reservoir or mixer of genetically diverse Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus species and plays a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses.",

The S protein RBD of F46 possesses identifying features typical of those belonging to bat SARSlike CoVs, namely three deletions and mutations within the key residues required for binding ACE2 (Figures 2A and 3) . 31, 32 Predicting from these features, F46 should be incapable of infecting humans directly. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that F46 is placed in one clade with strain Rs3367 and RsSHC014, which were more closely related to SARS-CoVs than to other SL-CoVs (Figure 1) , and particularly between LYRa11 and Rs3367 ( Figure 2 ). F46 likely represents an intermediate between LYRa11 and Rs3367. To understand the evolutionary pathway of F46, we conducted recombination analysis using available genome sequences of human/civet and bat SARS-like CoVs. A total of four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome with strong P-values (o10 -30 ). The results showed that F46 is a recombinant from Rs3367, LYRa11 and BJ01 lineages.",

Owing to the high likelihood of recombination among bat CoVs, additional bat SARS-like CoVs are likely to be identified in the future. To better predict and prevent the next emergence of disease caused by CoVs of bat origin, it is necessary to maintain long-term surveillance of bat CoVs. Figure 4 Recombination analysis of F46 with SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs. (A) A gene map of LYRa11 is used to position breakpoints. Four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome with strong P-values (o10 -30 ) supported by similarity plot and bootscan analyses (B, C). The breakpoints generated recombination of fragment A covering 1-8 and 848 nts (a total of 8 and 848 nt), including the 5\u2032-UTR and partial ORF 1a, and fragment B covering 21 684 to 23 271 nt (a total of 1587 nt), including a partial ORF of the spike gene. Similarity plots (B) and bootscan analyses (C) were conducted with F46 as the query and bat SARS-like CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) and SARS-CoV BJ01 as potential parental sequences. Phylogenetic trees (D, E) were constructed based on the two fragments with a neighbor-joining algorithm and a bootstrap test for inference of phylogeny. Bootstrap values were obtained from 1000 data sets. Coronavirus, CoV; nucleotide, nt; open reading frame, ORF; severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS; untranslated region, UTR.",
