(2, 3). For larger stocks, the procedure was scaled up to 10-15 dishes and the supernatants harvested at 24 and 36 hours post-transfection before clarification, filtration using a 0,45 \u00b5m filter, and concentration in SW28 (25,000 rpm, 2 hours and 30 minutes). Viruses were resuspended in 1X PBS containing 1% glycerol for 2 hours on ice, pooled, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. Titration was performed using serial dilutions (volumes: 1, 0.1 and 0.02 \u00b5L) of the pGFP vector stock to transduce 2 \u00d7 10 6 sMAGI cells in the presence of Polybrene (6 \u00b5g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). FACS analysis 48 hours post-transduction gave the proportion of GFP-positive cells and allowed us to calculate the amount of particles inoculated at day 0. Titres of \u226510 9 IU/ml were obtained (IU, infectious units). Assay for detection of replication competent virus To detect presence of replication competent virus (RCR) in viral preparations, we followed the French Commission de G\u00e9nie G\u00e9n\u00e9tique's recommendations (notice 4). Briefly, to be downgraded in category 2 laboratories, lentiviruses which were produced in category 3 laboratories had to be controlled: after permissive cells transduction, transduced cells supernatant was analyzed 7 days post-infection. The samples were assayed for SIV P27 capsid protein by ELISA and undetectable signals versus a control of non-transduced cells confirmed absence of RCR. Western Blotting Analysis Total proteins lysates from transfected 293Bosc cells were analyzed for DNAI1 and HAtagged DNAI1 proteins expression. Non-transfected 293Bosc cells do not express DNAI1 proteins. DNAI1 and HA-tagged DNAI1 proteins were produced by transient transfection of 293Bosc cells (35 mm dish) with each four different plasmids: pK-DNAI1, pK+DNAI1, pK-HA or pK+HA.",

After proteins electrophoretic transfer to Hybond-P PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Germany), non-specific sites were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in TBST containing 5% non-fat milk (TBST: 1% Tween-20 in Tris-Buffer Saline, 100 mM Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, 7.8<pH<8.2). Membranes were blotted with anti-dyn69 polyclonal rabbit antibody, 1/1000 (anti-DNAI1 raised against the peptide NNPVRDRECQTEPPPR, Eurogentec), anti-HA monoclonal mouse antibody, 1/4000 (H3663, Sigma-Aldrich), or anti-actin polyclonal rabbit antibody, 1/4000 (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich). As secondary antibody, a peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 dilution; NA9340V, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:25,000 dilution; NA931, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were used depending on the first antibody. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The specificity of anti-dyn69 polyclonal antibody was demonstrated by Western blot using ciliated and non-ciliated tissues, a band of about 80 kD appearing only on ciliated tissues.
