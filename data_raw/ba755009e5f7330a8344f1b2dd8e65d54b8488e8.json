            "text": "Results: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26-17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao's public. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012-2018. Thus, significant attention should be paid in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea.",

            "text": "Since late 2010, severe diarrhea outbreaks in pigs have occurred in China. The clinical features of the disease are characterized with watery diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and depression in pigs of all ages, and high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets [1] . Enteropathogenic viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) are causative agents for viral diarrhea in pigs [2] . Data from previous studies demonstrate that in recent years, highly virulent variant PEDV is the most common etiological pathogen responsible for porcine diarrhea in China. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, was first recognized as transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE)-like diarrhea in pigs in Shanghai, China, in 1973. The causative agent of PED was defined in 1984 [3] . Prior to 2010, PEDV infections were sporadic or endemic in China [1] . Since late 2010, variant strains of PEDV have emerged in China, and rapidly spread throughout the country [4, 5] . Pigs of all ages have suffered from a serious PED pandemic, resulting in the huge losses of piglets within 7 days of being born due to 80-100% morbidity and up to 100% mortality [2] . Currently, highly virulent pandemic variant PEDVs in genotype II group are dominant strains of PEDV, whereas classical strains of PEDV in genotype I group, including SD-M, AH-M, SQ2014, and SC1402 are rare [6] [7] [8] . In May 2013, PED was first reported in Iowa State in the USA, and afterwards rapidly spread to the main pork product states within a year [9, 10] . Thereafter, diarrhea outbreaks caused by variant PEDVs appeared in other Asian countries (Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, and Philippines) [11] [12] [13] [14] , America (Canada, Mexico, etc) [15, 16] , and European countries (Austria, Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, etc) [17, 18] .",

PDCoV belongs to the genus of deltacoronavirus, the family of coronaviridae, and was first described in swine samples from a surveillance performed in Hong Kong in 2012 [19] . Subsequently, the presence of PDCoV was successively recognized in the United States, South Korea, mainland China, and Thailand [20] [21] [22] . Clinical manifestations and histopathologic features referable to PDCoV are indistinguishable from those associated with PEDV and TGEV [20] , and are characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, depression and dehydration. In early 2017, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a novel diarrheal coronavirus, was recognized in young piglets and resulted in high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets, and then, this virus was frequently detected in diarrheal samples but confined in several pig farms in Guangdong province in Southern China [23, 24] . The SADS-CoVs had 95% genetic homology with bat-HKU2 coronavirus [25] . In the context of porcine diarrhea-associated viruses, TGEV and PoRV used to be the major pathogenic agents in pigs associated with severe diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets. TGEV is a coronavirus belonging to the genus of alphacoronavirus, within the family of Coronaviridae [26] . PoRV is a non-enveloped, 11-segmented double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus of rotavirus, in the family of Reoviridae [27] . In recent years, outbreaks caused by TGEV and PoRV in China were sharply reduced [28] [29] [30] .",

The eight PDCoV isolates determined in this studyhad 97.7-99.9% nt and 97.9-99.8% aa identities with each other; and with 95.2-99.4% nt identities and 95.5-99.1% aa identities with the reference strains from China and other countries around the world.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the aa sequence of the S1 protein demonstrated that PDCoV isolates were divided into two groups, that is, the Chinese-and US-likegroups.

Circles indicate the sequences determined in the present study morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets due to the infection of variant PEDVs were frequently observed. Genetic analysis based on the circulating strains of PEDV revealed that all PEDVs could be devided into two genotypes, GI and GII: 1) GI comprising of the classical strains of PEDV, which was representated by CV777 and the strains appeared before 2010, and 2) GII comprising the variant strains identified after 2010. Mutations, including insertion and deletion, were frequently observed among the complete genome of variant PEDVs, and of which, most were located in the spike gene, including the antigen epitope areas [36] . The S protein of PEDV is an important structural protein of coronavirus, and is thought to encode the antigenic determinants, especially the neutralizing epitopes of the virus [37] . Based on the phylogenetic analysis on the S protein, all of the 14 strains indentified in this study belonged to variant PEDV in GII. As reported, mutations appeared in the neutralizing epitopes on the S protein of PEDV, including a CO-26 K equvalent epitope COE (aa 499-638), SS2 (aa 748-755), SS6 (aa 764-771), and 2C10 (1368-1374) when compared with classical strains of PEDV [38, 39] . In this study, fourteen strains of PEDV idenetified had multiple mutations in the neutralizing epitope region of SS2 and SS6 when compared with CV777, which further verified demonstrated that currently circulating strains of PEDV were variant PEDVs, which could account for the poor protection in pigs when administrated CV777based vaccines.",

PDCoV was reported to share similar clinical featureswith PED [21, 22, 40, 41] . The genome of PDCoVs from China, the USA, and other countries had similar characteristics [42] . Nucleotide sequence comparison suggested that the S gene had more genetic diversity when compared to other genes/regions of PDCoV. Therefore, it is feasible to use the S gene to investigate genetic variations. In this study, the homology of the S gene/protein of all PDCoVs analyzed was > 95%. When compared to other strains, the eight strains identified in this study, together with Chinese strains (except HKU15-44 and AN-2004) and a Thailand strain TT_1115 showed an amino acid deletion in the Nterminal of the S protein. However, the biological significance of the deletion remains roughly unknown.",

The results indicated that PEDV was the most frequently detected virus with a prevalence rate varying between 50.21 and 62.1%. PDCoV was the second prevalent virus detectable in the diarrheal samples in pigs. It is worth noting that PDCoV-associated enteric disease might be a long-term threat to pig herds though it only appeared recently. We first reported the newly emerged SADS-CoV in Fujian province in Southern China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PEDVs in Southern China during last 7 years were variant PEDVs in GIIa, and the PDCoVs tested were closely related with Chinese PDCoVs.",
