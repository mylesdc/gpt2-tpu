A male patient, aged 77 years, was admitted to the Putuo District People's Hospital of Shanghai City (Shanghai, China) after presenting with a fever for four days. On April 3 rd 2013, the patient experienced chills and fever, without evident cause or regularity, with a maximum temperature of 39.4\u02daC. The patient did not suffer from a cough, expectoration, sore throat, runny nose, chest tightness, chest pain, pant or whole muscle and joint ache. A chest radiograph, obtained in the initial hospital, revealed a fuzzy shadow in the left lower lung (Fig. 1) . After intravenous (i.v) treatment with ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and levofloxacin (0.5 g/day) for three days, the fever improved. The patient was admitted to the Jingnan District Centre Hospital of Shanghai (Shanghai, China) with a body temperature of 37.8\u02daC. Emergency blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 5x10 9 /l (neutrophils, 83.6%) and a C-reactive protein level of 192 mg/l. A chest computed tomography scan (Somatom Definition AS+ 128 Multi-Slice CT Scanner; Siemens, Munich, Germany) revealed a 'frosted glass' appearance in both lungs, and a high density shadow was observed in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2) . In addition, a bronchiologram revealed inflammation and left lung consolidation. Since the patient was suspected of having pneumonia, the patient was admitted to the Central Hospital of Jingan District for further diagnosis and treatment. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and with approval from the Ethics Committee of the Central Hospital of Shanghai Jingan District. Written informed consent was obtained from the relatives of the patient.",

However, the patient continued to suffer from a fever with a body temperature of up to 39.1\u02daC, experiencing distress on day 2 following admission. With repeated inquiries into the medical history of the patient, it was found that the patient had come into contact with chickens two weeks previously. Combining the epidemiological history and the rapid progression in the pulmonary lesions of the patient (Fig. 3) , a diagnosis of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza was considered. Subsequently, the patient was isolated, administered active anti-infective agents (biapenem and azithromycin), an antiviral (oseltamivir; 75 mg/day, orally) and anti-inflammatory drugs (methylprednisolone at 200 mg/day). In addition, a biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilator was used for ventilatory support, and the patient received nasogastric enteral nutrition liquid. The case was reported to the Jingnan District Center for Disease Control (Shanghai, China) for nasopharyngeal swabs and blood sampling.

At 18:00 on April 9 th , the patient presented with cyanosis of the lips and limbs. In addition, the fingertip pulse oximeter monitor displayed a SPO 2 of 45%, and the patient underwent an emergency tracheal intubation for assisted ventilation (BIPAP mode; set inspiratory pressure, 20 cm H 2 O; positive end expiratory pressure, 10 cm H 2 O; assisted spontaneous breathing, 10 cm H 2 O; inspiratory time, 1.3 sec; respiratory rate, 16 times/min; concentration of oxygen inhalation, 100%), while improving microcirculation and anti-leakage. On April 10 th , the patient exhibited a damaged liver performance, and was administered nutritional support treatment (human albumin), intravenous immunoglobulin to strengthen the immunity, drugs for liver protection [Coenzyme Q10 (20 mg orally, three times daily); and Compound Glycyrrhihizin (0.2 g i.v. once daily)], daily fluid therapy [5% glucose solution (500 ml), 5% glucose and sodium chloride solution (500 ml) and 0.9% sodium chloride solution (500 ml)], and psychological treatment. The chest radiograph showed progression of the lesions in the right lung (Fig. 4) . In addition, blood biochemical analysis revealed glucose levels of 16.8 mmol/l, myoglobin levels of 1,483 ng/ml, creatine kinase levels of 1,561 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase levels of 1,007 U/l, albumin levels of 20 g/l, alanine aminotransferase levels of 82 IU/l, aspartate aminotransferase levels of 185 IU/l, urea nitrogen levels of 15.85 mmol/l, creatinine levels of 152.50 \u00b5mol/l, potassium levels of 4.47 mmol/l, sodium levels of 155 mmol/l and chloride levels of 115.10 mmol/l. Plasma osmotic pressure was 335.74 mmol/l, which was calculated from the following formula: 2 x (serum sodium concentration + serum potassium concentration) + blood glucose concentration; the normal reference value is between 280 and 310 mmol/l. Considering the hypertonicity of the plasma, the patient was administered cold boiled water, an aggressive diuretic and a small dose of dopamine treatment (5 \u00b5g/kg/min, i.v). If the serum creatinine level had continued to increase and the urine volume decrease, continual renal replacement therapy at the bedside was considered. On April 10 th at 15:00, a small amount of coffee colored material emerged from the corner of the lips, and a 50-ml volume of the coffee colored substance was drained. Following application of gastrointestinal decompression, an occult blood test of the vomit showed occult blood++, indicating a moderate degree of microscopic hematuria. The patient was fasted, gastrointestinal decompression was continued and proton pump inhibitor treatment was applied. By 23:00, the patient had a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. The monitor displayed the heart rate at 150 bpm, the RR at 35 and an SPO 2 of 87%. In addition, the ECG revealed atrial fibrillation at a rapid ventricular rate. The patient was immediately administered 200 mg Cordarone, 20 mg furosemide, 40 mg Xinkang, 50 mg morphine and 0.4 mg cedilanid intravenously. After 1 h, the heart rate and breathing of the patient improved. On April 13 th , the patient exhibited a persistent fever, circulation failure with renal failure. Furthermore, the blood pressure was unable to be maintained and the levels of urine were very low. On April 14 th at 00:55, the patient succumbed to multiple organ failure, which caused cardiac arrest, and subsequently the loss of ventilator breathing, an arterial pulse and a pupillary light reflex. The ECG was shown to be asystole, and clinical death was confirmed.",

Detection of the H7N9 virus in samples collected from a pigeon and chickens at a market in Shanghai was confirmed by the China Animal Disease Control Center (Beijing, China) (5) . Severe infection with H7N9 avian influenza usually has the initial symptoms of fever and respiratory system infection, and monitoring of the sustained clinical symptoms and dynamic radio-imaging should be performed. In addition, samples should be collected immediately following admission for virus nucleic acid detection to confirm the diagnosis, which may promptly improve the medication time (6). The influenza virus not only invades the respiratory system, but also affects multiple organs. With the added complications of the different baseline statuses of patients and the atypical clinical manifestations, dynamic monitoring of pulmonary imaging is particularly important for the early identification of lung infections and diseases, since viral pneumonia characteristic changes can be detected. In addition, close monitoring of blood gas analysis, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes and immune indexes should be performed, as this may lead to early detection of the disease and subsequent prevention of complications. For cases that cannot be clinically confirmed, if there are underlying diseases and risk factors, timely administration of oseltamivir should be provided to inhibit viral replication, as well as treatments aimed at the causes. The emergence of the novel H7N9 influenza has caused global concern with regard to the ability of this virus to spread between humans (7); however, until now, there is no sufficient evidence of that which requires further study.",
