This graphical representation not only avoids degeneracy, but also has good visualization no matter how long these sequences are, and can reflect the length of protein sequence. Then we transform the 2D-graphical representation into a numerical characterization that can facilitate quantitative comparison of protein sequences. The utility of this approach is illustrated by two examples: one is similarity/dissimilarity comparison among different ND6 protein sequences based on their DV-curve figures the other is the phylogenetic analysis among coronaviruses based on their spike proteins.",

DNA sequences can be represented in different dimension spaces. For example, G-curve and Hcurve [1] were first proposed by Hamori and Ruskin before thirty years. Later, Gates [2] established a 2D graphical representation that was simpler than H curve. However, Gate's graphical representation has high degeneracy because of some circuits appearing in its curve. Several researchers in their recent studies have outlined different kinds of DNA sequences graphical representation based on 2D [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , 3D [12] [13] [14] [15] , 4D [16] , 5D [17] , and 6D [18] . Among these methods, we here stress DV-curve representation which was proposed by Zhang [10] . DV-curve uses two vectors to represent one alphabet of DNA sequences and avoids degeneracy and loss of information. Furthermore, DV-curve has good visualization no matter how long these sequences are and can reflect the length of the DNA sequence.",

Although protein sequences and DNA sequences belong to symbolic sequences, the methods for the graphical representation of protein sequences are relatively less popular, compared with DNA sequences. The key reason is that the extension of DNA graphical representation to protein sequences enormously increases the number of possible alternative assignments for these 20 amino acids. The amino acid sequence is the key to discover protein structure and function in the cell, so analysis of amino acid sequences is a very important part of postgenomic studies. The graphical representation study of protein sequences emerged very recently. The first visualization protein model was proposed by Randi\u0107 et al. until 2004 [19] . Some researchers have studied on graphical representation of protein sequences from different perspectives [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In this paper, we introduce DV-curve graphical representation of protein sequences based on the detailed hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model of amino acids. According to the important hydropathy, this approach is accompanied by a relatively small number of arbitrary choices associated with the graphical representation of proteins. Also, this representation has relatively good visualization effect to describe protein sequences in a perceivable way. As its application, we analyze the similarity/dissimilarity among some ND6 sequences and construct the phylogenetic tree of 35 coronavirus spike proteins.",

The closer the genetic relationship is, the smaller the difference in amino acid composition between them will be. Over the past thirty years, the characteristics of protein sequences have been studied by establishing different classified models [21-24, 26, 27] . A well-known model of protein sequences is the hydrophobic (H or nonpolar)-hydrophilic (P or polar), that is, the HP model may be too simple and lacks enough consideration on the heterogeneity and the complexity of the natural set of residues [30] . Based on Brown's work [31] , 20 different kinds of amino acids are divided into four groups: nonpolar (np), negative polar (nep), uncharged polar (up), and positive polar (pp). This is called the detailed HP model, which can provide more information than the original HP model. For a given protein sequence = 1 2 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 with length , where is the letter in the th position among the protein sequence ( = 1, 2, . . . , ), we define a primary protein sequence as a symbolic sequence which includes four letters according to the following rule:",

In addition, the advantage of our method is that it can visualize the local and global features among different proteins no matter how long these sequences are and avoid degeneracy at the same time. The new approach is applied in two aspects: one is similarity intuitive analysis of ND6 protein sequences of several species and the other is phylogenetic analysis among 35 coronaviruses based on their spike proteins. Results have shown that our proposed method is more intuitional, simple, effectual, and feasible.",
