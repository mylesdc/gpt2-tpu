            "text": "The mortality rate of hemorrhagic African swine fever (ASF), which targets domestic pigs and wild boars is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), can reach 100%. Since the first confirmed ASF outbreak in China on 3 August 2018, 156 ASF outbreaks were detected in 32 provinces. About 1,170,000 pigs were culled in order to halt further spread. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12abased On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no crossreactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37 \u2022 C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4 \u2022 C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field-based applications.",

ASF is caused by a large, complex double-stranded DNA virus, the African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Galindo and Alonso, 2017) . The disease shares similar clinical signs with classical swine fever (CSF) and several other swine diseases (Oura et al., 2013) , making its diagnosis difficult, especially outside of a diagnostics laboratory By 5 September 2019, 156 outbreaks were detected in China and 1,170,000 pigs were culled in an effort to halt further spread (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2019). There is no effective treatment or vaccine against ASF yet, so controlling ASF mainly relies on animal slaughter and sanitary measures (Galindo and Alonso, 2017; Dixon et al., 2019) . Therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis of ASF infections is crucial for controlling epidemics.",

            "text": "The recommended gold standard for diagnosis according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is virus isolation. But this is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and virus isolation is not a method applicable to disease monitoring and control (Oura et al., 2013) . The antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a rapid and convenient method for detecting ASFV antigens (Oura et al., 2013) . However, it lacks sensitivity in subacute cases or for early-stage infections and has poor specificity because it cannot correctly identify different viral strains (Oura et al., 2013; Boonham et al., 2014) . Hence, the molecular tools for detecting ASFV, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR, have become popular because of their sensitivity and specificity for ASF diagnosis (Oura et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, such methods are not suitable for on-site situations (e.g., on farms) or for rapid viral detection as they require thermal cycling instruments and skilled operators (Ikeno et al., 2013; Boonham et al., 2014; Khodakov et al., 2016) . Isothermal amplification techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop mediated isothermal amplification and cross-priming amplification, have been successfully used to detect ASFV (Oura et al., 2013) . Recently, many novel isothermal amplification assays in combination with immunochromatographic strips have also been developed for on-site detection of ASFV (Gao et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019) . With no need for instruments and skilled operators, isothermal amplification has become a promising onsite detection method. But like other amplification technologies, its resolution depends on the binding specificity between the primers and templates, which can limit their accuracy (Boonham et al., 2014; He et al., 2019) .",

In this study, we combined Cas12a with recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and an immunochromatographic lateral flow strip to develop a test strip method, termed CORDS (Cas12abased On-site and Rapid Detection System) for ASFV on-site detection. CORDS can detect the ASFV target at a sensitivity of 1 fM within 1 h of initiation and without cross reaction to 13 porcine virus DNAs. When the RAA-Cas12a-based system was combined with fluorescence, the sensitivity increased to 10 aM. Finally, CORDS can also be freeze-dried in three tubes, making it suitable for transportation and storage, factors that are helpful in resource limited on-site situations. The lyophilized CORDS products are highly stable. Successful detection of ASFV with sensitivity comparable to that of SHERLOCK and without the need for expensive instruments makes our method a robust on-site detection platform.",

            "text": "Since August 2018, ASF has affected 32 provinces in China and caused great economic losses (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2019). ASF occurred as a rapid outbreak across the nation, indicating its highly contagious nature (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2019). Given its similar clinical signs to several other porcine diseases (Galindo and Alonso, 2017) and the lack of laboratory facilities for diagnosis on farms, diagnosing ASF often requires infected samples to be transported to a qualified laboratory, which delays diagnosis and increases the chances of contagion. Hence, accurate and on-site diagnosis of ASF is essential for surveillance and control of ASF outbreaks. Ours is the first report of a Cas12a-based assay using immunochromatographic lateral flow strips, termed CORDS, which enables the on-site detection of ASFV in 1 h ( Figure 5E ). This new assay requires no instrumentation other than a 37 \u2022 C incubator, and its reaction temperature (body temperature) could be easily attained in an on-site situation. The whole reaction system comprises three tubes of lyophilized powder. Thus, the CORDS assay's workflow only includes dissolution of lyophilized powders and addition of the samples, without any complex technical requirements. The whole detection process takes only 1 h and displays its result through the band visualized on a lateral flow strip. Therefore, the CORDS assay has the advantage of detecting ASFV on-site (i.e., on farms or in slaughter houses) in a short time and without access to a diagnostics laboratory.",

In the present study, the CORDS assay did not cross-react with 13 nucleic acid samples from typical porcine viruses, making it superior to the methods reported until now (Gao et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019) .

To be precise, the system can detect ASFV p72 gene copies as low as 6 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL, which is more sensitive than isothermal amplification-based assays (Oura et al., 2013) (which are considered good choices for on-site viral detection) and compares well with the newly reported lateral flow strip based assays for ASFV detection (Gao et al., 2018) , Miao et al., 2019) . The sensitivity of this assay is sufficient for ASF diagnosis on farms or in slaughter houses. During the ASFV infection process, blood virus levels can increase to 1 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL in 5-8 days post-infection (dpi) (Olesen et al., 2018) . ASFV infections can result in virus levels of up to 1 \u00d7 10 9 TCID 50 /mL in the blood (Dixon et al., 2019) , indicating that virus genome copies can achieve >1 \u00d7 10 9 copies/mL. Hence, the femtomolar sensitivity of the CORDS assay should diagnose ASF at an early stage of infection (5-8 dpi) when the virus genome copy number reaches 1 \u00d7 10 6 .",

We found that the assay maintained femtomolar sensitivity after lyophilization. Lyophilization significantly simplifies the operational process and improves the detection stability. According to our accelerated stability tests, the RAA buffer mix still maintained femtomolar sensitivity after storage at 37 \u2022 C for 1 week. The lyophilized Cas mix should work well after storage at 4 \u2022 C for 1 week without any sensitivity decrease. Therefore, these stability tests show that CORDS can be stored and transported under the conditions provided by the diagnostic kit's manufacturers. It is envisaged that lyophilized CORDS has potential for industrial manufacturing and widespread onsite application. According to the accelerated stability tests, the lyophilized Cas mix is not as stable as the lyophilized RAA buffer mix and manufacturer provided RAA mix. Considering Cas12a is a rather stable protein, the cause might be instability of the crRNA. RNA modification or capping may help to solve this problem and enable transportation at room temperature to lower the assay costs.",
