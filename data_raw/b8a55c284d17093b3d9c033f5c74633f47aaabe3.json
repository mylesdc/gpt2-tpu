            "text": "Bloodstream infection (BSI) and sepsis are rising in incidence throughout the developed world. The spread of multi-drug resistant organisms presents increasing challenges to treatment. Surviving BSI is dependent on rapid and accurate identification of causal organisms, and timely application of appropriate antibiotics. Current culture-based methods used to detect and identify agents of BSI are often too slow to impact early therapy and may fail to detect relevant organisms in many positive cases. Existing methods for direct molecular detection of microbial DNA in blood are limited in either sensitivity (likely the result of small sample volumes) or in breadth of coverage, often because the PCR primers and probes used target only a few specific pathogens. There is a clear unmet need for a sensitive molecular assay capable of identifying the diverse bacteria and yeast associated with BSI directly from uncultured whole blood samples. We have developed a method of extracting DNA from larger volumes of whole blood (5 ml per sample), amplifying multiple widely conserved bacterial and fungal genes using a mismatch-and background-tolerant PCR chemistry, and identifying hundreds of diverse organisms from the amplified fragments on the basis of species-specific genetic signatures using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). We describe the analytical characteristics of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and compare its preclinical performance to current standard-of-care methods in a collection of prospectively collected blood specimens from patients with symptoms of sepsis. The assay generated matching results in 80% of culture-positive cases (86% when common contaminants were excluded from the analysis), and twice the total number of positive detections. The described method is capable of providing organism identifications directly from uncultured blood in less than 8 hours.

Incubation times of up to 5 days may be necessary to capture the majority of cultureable bacteria and fungi associated with BSI, though many infections can be detected after 24 to 48 hours [12, 13] . Further time is required to obtain identifications via MALDI--TOF, DNA sequence, or traditional biochemical analysis. These temporal delays leave practitioners with little choice but to treat all patients with suspected BSI empirically using broadspectrum antibiotics. This strategy results in 15-30% of septic patients receiving inappropriate antibiotic therapies, which is, in turn, associated with a 2 to 5-fold higher mortality risk [6, 8, 14] . This risk derives from the empirical use of antibiotics that are ineffective for rarer organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Candida [14] .",

Molecular detection of bacteria in culture-negative specimens is correlated with antibiotic pretreatment [9, 23] and primarily identifies species known to be causal agents of BSI. These correlations all suggest that many culture-negative, PCR-positive detections represent culture insensitivity rather than a lack of specificity or clinical relevance on the part of molecular methods. This is supported by literature which widely reports that blood culture is positive in only 50% of cases where BSI is strongly suspected from a clinical standpoint [16, 24, 25] .",

To meet this need, we have developed a universal lysis and DNA extraction method capable of sampling 5 ml of whole blood [24] . This is paired with conserved-site PCR primers capable of generating amplicons from >95% of the eubacteria and Candida species associated with human infection [30, 31] and PCR chemistry and cycling conditions compatible with high concentrations of background human DNA [24, 32, 33] . The method utilizes an automated desalting and DNA debulking platform to prepare amplicons for mass spectrometry [24, 34] and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) platform capable of discriminating amplicon sequence variants from one or more different species present in a sample [35, 36, 37] . An onboard analysis computer is used to parse and report detections of 673 species of bacteria and Candida on the basis of multi-locus amplicon base composition signatures and quality controls including an external lysis control, internal PCR controls, external mass spectrometry standards, and signal strength and quality metrics [24, 31, 35] .",

Each sample requires approximately 30 minutes of hands-on time for a single technician when run in batch mode (~2.5 hours hands-on time for a batch of 6 samples), involving reagent preparation, sample loading, transfer between instruments, and instrument decontamination. Hands-on requirements are interspersed temporally throughout the first 5 hours of the process and require a trained laboratory technician with competence in sterile technique, metered fluid transfer, vortexing, pipetting, use of a clinical centrifuge, and bar code scanning to track samples, equipment, users, reagents, and results.

For this reason, this study was not intended to demonstrate that all analytes could be simultaneously detected and identified in mixtures, but rather that the presence of multiple organisms did not prevent the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay from detecting and correctly identifying at least one of the components of a mixture. The assay successfully detected and accurately identified at least one of the two spiked analytes in 18/18 instances, and was able to detect and identify both spiked analytes in 15/18 instances. The three cases in which only one of the two spiked analytes were detected were all mixtures of MRSA and VRE-in two of these only MRSA was detected, and in one case only VRE was detected.",

Both culture and the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay utilize single reagents to detect many or all targets. Therefore, the presence of detected organisms can mask the detection of other organisms through competitive interference. In culture, faster growing organisms can readily outcompete slower-growing organisms in culture bottles and obviate isolation of slower-growing organisms. In broad-spectrum PCR-based systems like IRIDICA, which use conserved-site primer pairs to amplify partially conserved regions from multiple species, targets with better matches to specific primer pairs may outcompete other species for amplification [27, 35] . This obscures meaningful interpretation of negative results in samples that are already positive for at least one analyte.",

Positive detections which thereby had indeterminate comparators were assigned to the \"additional detection\" category in the final comparison (see Table 5 ). Two hundred and seven samples yielded matched negative results for all analytes by both the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and culture methods. The IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay matched 32 of the 40 comparable detections reported by culture (80% positive agreement) and detected an additional 46 organisms in culture-negative samples. When potential contaminant organisms (listed at the bottom of Tables 3 and 4) were excluded from analysis, the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay results matched 30 of 35 comparable detections reported by culture (86% positive agreement), and detected an additional 34 organisms not identified in culture. The majority of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections identified either species commonly associated with BSI, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus; or clinically relevant species unlikely to be detected by common culture bottle methods, including Ehrlichia chaffeensis [33] and Mycoplasma hominis [46] . Others were of fastidious species which occur as both pathogens and common environmental contaminants, such as Mycobacterium simiae [47] . Eleven of the 46 IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections were supported by chart data showing positive detections of the same organisms and identifying them as causal pathogens in subsequent standard-of-care analyses of blood, biopsy, or respiratory specimens from the same patients. These are noted in Tables 3 and 4 . The overall results obtained in this clinical sample study were consistent with those obtained in similar studies comparing the performance of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay with culture in separate populations of patients with suspected sepsis [48, 49] .",

IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay results should be interpreted in the context of associated symptoms, risk factors, and other laboratory findings, in the same manner that current standard-of-care culture identifications are utilized. The IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay yielded approximately twice as many positive detections as culture across the described set of 285 clinical blood specimens from patients with symptoms of sepsis. In the majority of cases, the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections were either of species commonly associated with BSI or of clinically relevant human pathogens that would be difficult to grow in blood culture bottles (e.g. Ehrlichia chaffeensis). Common contaminants (e.g. Propionibacterium acnes) were also observed in culture-negative specimens. Despite having access to only partial chart data, 11 of the 46 unmatched IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay detections were specifically supported by subsequent identifications and/or diagnostic data from independent specimens showing infection of the patient by the species initially detected by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay. Many of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections thereby represent clinically relevant bloodstream infections which were missed by culture in the original paired specimen. This is consistent with literature suggesting that the sensitivity of culture is suboptimal [16, 24, 25] . The broad-spectrum nature of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay primers, paired with a signal analysis method capable of sensitive and specific detection and identification of one or more species signatures in samples with high background levels of human DNA, make it uniquely suited as a molecular test for bacterial and Candida DNA in blood samples.",

Based upon the results of a previous DS/MS reproducibility study, the IRIDICA DS and MS instruments and reagents were not controlled as variables in this part of the study, though multiple DS and MS instruments and lots of reagents were used. All organisms were spiked into EDTA whole blood (BAC BSI Assay), saline bronchoalveolar lavage collection fluid (BAC LRT Assay), or the sterile buffer used to dilute normally sterile body fluid and tissue specimens (BAC SFT Assay) at 3x LOD. Either 500\u03bcl of bovine synovial fluid or 35 mg of porcine tissue was added to each IRIDICA BAC SFT Assay sample prior to bead beating. Reproducibility results are shown inTable 2. The average time from sample preparation to first result during the reproducibility study was approximately seven hours.Two hundred and eighty-five clinical blood samples were analyzed by both culture and the IRI-DICA BAC BSI Assay, generating 273 valid result sets. The validity rate of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay was thereby estimated at 95.7% in this clinical study. The IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay produced 85 organism detections, while culture produced 45.

Possible identities of ambiguous IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay detections are separated by semicolons in cases where insufficient data was captured to provide species-level identification, and by slashes if the indicated organisms share identical reference signatures and cannot be discriminated. Commas separate multiple independent detections. These indicators are shown as they were reported by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay.These 11 culture-negative, IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive detections were supported by later organism-specific ID data which identified the same species as agents of infection (as noted on the subjects' charts). Numbers in parentheses indicate how many such cases were supported. Two hundred and seven samples were negative for all analytes by both culture and IRIDICA (matched true negatives). These are shown inTable 3.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0158186.t004 detections, supporting the assumption that detections in the clinical samples represented organismal DNA present in the sample.In cases where both the clinical laboratory and the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay detected an organism associated with one of the antibiotic resistance markers targeted by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, standard-of-care resistance test results were compared with resistance marker detections reported by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay. In all 13 such cases, the standard-of-care results matched the resistance gene results from the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay. Results are shown in",
