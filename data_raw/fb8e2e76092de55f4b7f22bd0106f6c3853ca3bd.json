            "text": "In the present study, a new hepatic tissue-origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L-15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15-32\u00b0C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27\u00b0C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immunerelated molecules interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.",

A. anguilla was first introduced into China in 1993. In the late 1990s' and in the first decade of the present century, A. anguilla became the most productive aquacultured Anguillidae species in China. The failed artificial breeding of eels rendered the whole eel industry capturebased, relying on the capture of wild juvenile glass eels (Politis et al., 2017) . In the last 50 years, the abundance of A. anguilla in its original habitat has decreased over 90% (Dekker, 2004 (Dekker, , 2018 , In 2009, A. anguilla was listed CR (critically endangered) by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the precious species is still threatened by various pathogens and pollutants (Yue et al., 1998; Zhang and Gui, 2007; Jakob et al., 2009; Hendriks et al., 2010; Galinier et al., 2012; Ge et al., 2012; van Beurden et al., 2012; Fichtner et al., 2013) . The disease prevention and protection of A. anguilla requires additional viable in vitro cell line tools. To date, the Anguillidae invitrome remains considerably limited (Table 1) (Bols et al., 2017) . Several cell lines have been derived from Anguilla japonica (Temminck and Schlegel 1846) in the last century (Chen and Kou, 1981; Chen et al., 1982; Kou et al., 1995) , while only two cell lines were reported to originate from Anguilla rostrata (Lesueur 1817) (Dewitte-Orr et al., 2006; Bloch et al., 2016) in recent years. However, a limited number of cell lines have been developed from A. anguilla. Our lab attempted for the first time the in vitro tissue and cell culture of multiple European eel organs in 2007 (Zheng, 2008) and the first viscera cell line of A. anguilla has been established (Chen et al., 2019) .",

The subcultures initially consisted of almost the same number of fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cells, as well as a limited number of stellate-like cells.

These findings could be attributed to the origin of the experimental animals used. As a European-origin catadromous teleost (Schmidt, 1923) , the artificial reproduction of A. anguilla is a difficult task. Since the wild-type embryo and the neonatal leptocephalus are mainly present in the oceans, the glass eels are the predominant catches collected in the European coastal waters. However, their export was restricted after being considered endangered species in 2009. Therefore, the elvers are the youngest eel to be collected from the fish farmers in China. The 20 g elvers had been shown to be at their growth peak in the ponds (Huang and Cheng, 1997) and their tissues and cells were already highly differentiated. Furthermore, the several types of parasites discovered in eel viscera and muscles may also negatively affect the growth potential of early in vitro cultures.",

            "text": "The rapid response kinetics of the gene expression levels of various immune factors with regard to in vitro or in vivo inflammatory stimulation has been confirmed repeatedly in teleosts (Sudhakumari et al., 2005; Haddad et al., 2008; Maehr et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014) . However, the mechanism of inflammatory-induced immune modulation remains ambiguous. Recently, cell lines have been used as tools for functional analysis of fish innate immunity genes. The IRF family members play critical roles in the cellular differentiation of hematopoietic cells, in the regulation of gene expression in response to pathogen-derived danger signals, and consequently in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (Tamura et al., 2008) . Irf3 and irf7 are highly expressed in the teleost liver (Yao et al., 2012) . Irf3 has been reported to be upregulated in both peripheral blood leukocytes and in vivo models following poly (I:C) or LPS stimulation in A. anguilla. This was confirmed in the present study, by the alterations of the irf7 levels following LPS induction. It is interesting to note that the expression levels of irf7 were downregulated in response to poly (I:C) in the present study, compared with a previous in vivo study (Huang et al., 2014) . This may be due to the absence of some protein members that participate in multiple cross-talk in vivo signaling pathways.",

In the present study, the expression levels of CYP450 indicated a significant long-term upregulation following poly (I:C) and/or LPS exposure, indicating that the EL cell line could retain the intrinsic characteristics of its hepatic origin. This renders the EL cell line an ideal model for toxicological and pharmacological analysis of aquatic pollutants.",
