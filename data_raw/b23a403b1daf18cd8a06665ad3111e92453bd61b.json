Well known examples are the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human hepatitis C virus (HCV) that have worldwide infected around 40 and 170 million people, respectively. While the former slowly destroys the immune system of its host resulting in acquired immunodeficiency and death due to the uncontrolled expansion of opportunistic infections, the latter, when becoming a chronic infection, leads to liver cell destruction and after decades to cirrhosis and possibly liver cell carcinoma. Even more frightening can be viruses that have a much faster disease course like some influenza strains, the SARS corona virus and hemorrhagic fever viruses which can kill their hosts in the order of days and weeks rather than several years. Without having efficient vaccines available, the best at hand to combat these threads are antiviral drugs. But there are major limitations. For many of the viruses, especially for the novel emerging viruses, there are no or only limited options for antiviral therapy. Furthermore, as most of the antivirals are specifically targeting individual viral proteins and, on the other hand, viruses most frequently exhibit high replication error rates combined with a rapid turnover of large populations, the selection of drug resistant strains within an infected host is common. While this problem can in part be solved by combining drugs with different target specificities, a setback is the increased side effects inherent to multi-drug intake [1] .",

Such types of studies are now opening up a new era in antiviral drug research [1] . Due to its genetic tractability and the new technological platforms and tools recently created, global studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been at the forefront of such technical advances [2] . Moreover, since there is a notable gene homology between yeast and human genes and a high conservation of fundamental biochemical pathways, studies in yeast are helpful to discover fundamental cellular processes Remarkably, yeastbased studies have provided main achievements in virus research as well. These include, for example, the elucidation of key processes in viral replication and its use in antiviral drug development [2] . For drug development high throughput genomic analyses are performed to systematically screen the effect of a given drug on every gene. Such analyses will promote the identification and understanding of metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits involved in the action of a drug. This information will also provide a more detailed measure of toxicity and will therefore assist fundamentally the development of drug candidates.",

By targeting these so-called virus dependency factors of the host cell by drugs, virus multiplication might not only be inhibited but in addition might restrict the rapid generation of resistance. Furthermore, as groups of viruses share common replication strategies and common host factor requirements, it might become possible to even inhibit multiple viruses with a single agent [1] . For example, some of the factors required for the replication of model viruses in yeast are also required for the replication of human viruses in human cells [4, 6, 7] While this gives exciting future perspectives, the present challenge is how to prioritize among the many virus dependency factors experimentally determined.",

One would expect the latter condition to be best fulfilled if the change in cellular viability characteristics would be minimal. Growth rate or even respiration are relevant primary characteristics [12] . Even more relevant are metabolic flux distributions [13] but the presumably most sensitive and most comprehensive indicator of such changes is the cellular metabolome [14] . Any modification on the level of DNA, RNA or proteins is expected to be further manifested in metabolite level changes. The scope of this work is to study the effect of the deletion of PAT1, LSM1 and DHH1 on central metabolites in S. cerevisiae and to estimate the adverse effects on the host organism and its metabolism by quantitatively comparing their metabolomes. We found that the levels of metabolites differed clearly between the reference strain S. cerevisiae BY4742 and the deletion strains pat1\u0394, lsm1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394. PAT1 gene deletion resulted in the smallest deviation from reference cells. This seems therefore the most promising target with respect to host cell toxicity. High throughput drug screening approaches should therefore focus on the human analogue of PAT1.",

The specific growth rate of pat1\u0394, 0.22 h -1 , was quite similar to that of the reference strain, 0.28 h -1 , whereas dhh1\u0394, 0.16 h -1 , and lsm1\u0394, 0.15 h -1 , grew clearly slower. The specific glucose uptake rates of pat1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394, 2.00 \u00b1 0.11 g g -1 CDW h -1 and 2.10 \u00b1 0.10 g g -1 CDW h -1 , were quite similar but differed significantly compared to the reference strain, 2.45 \u00b1 0.13 g g -1 CDW h -1 , and lsm1\u0394, 1.67 \u00b1 0.10 g g -1 CDW h -1 . Consider-ing standard deviations specific glycerol production rates were similar for the reference strain and the deletion strains pat1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394 with 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 g g -1 CDW h -1 , 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 g g -1 CDW h -1 and 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 g g -1 CDW h -1 . The specific glycerol production rate of 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 g g -1 CDW h -1 for the lsm1\u0394 strain was clearly lower. The specific ethanol production rate of 1.05 \u00b1 0.05 g g -1 CDW h -1 for the reference strain was higher than for the deletion strains pat1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394 with 0.72 \u00b1 0.04 g g -1 CDW h -1 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.04 g g -1 CDW h -1 . The specific ethanol production rate of the lsm1\u0394 mutant was lowest, 0.60 \u00b1 0.03 g g -1 CDW h -1 . Based on these results the deletion of the PAT1 and DHH1 genes seem to have the least influence on the metabolism of the cell. A clear prioritization is, however not possible only considering these data. Generally, the specific uptake and production rates were proportional to the specific growth rate \u03bc max as described earlier [12] which holds for the reference strain, pat1\u0394 and lsm1\u0394. The specific rates for dhh1\u0394 were slightly higher compared to pat1\u0394.",

This kind of normalization yielded more consistent results compared to normalization to CDW or internal standards and was therefore used for the comparison of the four strains ( Table 3 ). The resulting average error was approximately 20% comparing six samples from each strain. For checking the suitability of the chosen normalization method, intracellular amino acid concentrations of the same samples were determined by HPLC [15] and GC/ MS.

These results confirm that cells were in true exponential growth and therefore constant concentrations of intracellular metabolites could be assumed during the entire sampling period. At the different sampling times biomass concentration was varying between 0.73 -1.44 g CDW l -1 , but did obviously not cause significant disturbances. These results also indicate the applicability of the chosen normalization procedure since resulting PLS scores are randomly distributed within their specific cluster. Figure 5 again shows that metabolites measured in the pat1\u0394 deletion strain are least deviating from those in the reference strain. The two deletion GC/MS spectrum of a S. cerevisiae BY4742 pat1\u0394 cell extract strains lsm1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394 are obviously more distant agreeing with the Euclidian distance calculations depicted in Figure 4 .",

However, the quantitative effects of the individual deletions on physiological parameters as growth and substrate consumption rates and intracellular metabolite levels were different. In our study we could identify 41 intracellular metabolites and 6 metabolites of unknown chemical structure in polar extracts of S. cerevisiae using GC/MS covering nearly all parts of central metabolism. The average variation of intracellular metabolite concentrations of the six independent samples of one single strain was around 20%. The variation in the analysis of polar leaf extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in 101 identified metabolites and 113 of unknown chemical structure and a biological variation of 35% in average [20] . Strelkov et al. [21] identified 88 intracellular metabolites in the polar extracts of Corynebacterium glutamicum. More metabolites could be identified with less stringent identification criteria; however here we used the standard identification criteria of the AMDIS software. As Figure 2 shows, there are a lot more compounds visible in the chromatogram than identified and used for strain comparison in this work. Using less stringent identification rules resulted in the identification of 39 additional metabolites which were, however, not used for strain comparison. Most importantly, this study showed clear differences on the intracellular metabolome changes between the different gene deletion strains. Intracellular metabolite levels of all three deletion strains, pat1\u0394, lsm1\u0394 and dhh1\u0394 differed from those of the reference strain S. cerevisiae BY4742. It was, however, found that the deletion of PAT1 showed the least differences to the reference strain. Some of the metabolites found (Table 3 ) are usually not observed in human, others are essential amino acids that are not synthesized by human. It is interesting to see that metabolome differences were similar with and without these metabolites. This indicates a certain robustness of the method. The most pronounced non-human metabolite, trehalose, may, however, be replaced by glycogen in human. The other non-human metabolites, erythritol, mannitol and homoserine are changed only little. Intracellular concentrations of amino acids essential in human are changed significantly in yeast but this did not have any significant effect on the overall analysis. The metabolome results are supported by the fact that the measured specific growth rates of the pat1\u0394 strain and the reference strain were most similar. In general it can however be expected that metabolome analysis is much more sensitive than mere growth rate determination and will, together with genomic, transcriptomics and proteomic assays, greatly enhance our understanding of mechanisms of drug effect and of adverse drug reactions [14] .",
