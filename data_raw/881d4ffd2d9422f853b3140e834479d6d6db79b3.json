            "text": "Approximately 50 million dengue infections occur yearly, making it the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world [1, 2] . In 2002, dengue deaths amounted to 12,000 in South-East Asia, 4,000 in the Western Pacific and 2,000 in America [3] . Dengue has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from a non-severe illness whereby outpatient treatment would suffice, to severe disease, hallmarked by plasma leakage requiring hospitalization. With increasing severity of plasma leakage, hypovolaemic shock ensues and the morbidity and mortality rises sharply. According to one study, the estimated cost of a non-fatal ambulatory case was US$ 514, and the cost for a non-fatal hospitalized case was US$ 1,491 [4] . Thus, a hospitalized dengue case cost on average three times more than an ambulatory case. Moreover, dengue has considerable impact on the quality of life (QoL). One study found that all dengue patients experienced a drastic fall in their quality of life starting from the onset of symptoms [5] . Furthermore, dengue patients are more likely to be susceptible to dehydration caused by the high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and associated anorexia, which, if not carefully monitored and treated, may lead to shock, particularly in those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. [6] . Intravenous fluid is part of the therapy given for suspected dengue patients with dehydration. However, fluid overload frequently occurs during the management of dengue patients and is a risk which is not present when fluid is consumed orally. Despite the fact that oral rehydration therapy is incorporated in the standard outpatient management of dengue, the discussion on the use of such therapy for dengue is scarce. The study conducted in Nicaragua was the first study to examine the effect of fluid intake at home for dengue cases [6] . The results from this study showed that an oral fluid intake of 5 glasses per day decreases the risk for hospitalization of dengue patients [6] . In fact, based on this study, WHO had revised their dengue guidelines in 2009 and it includes the recommendation of oral fluid intake of five glasses or more for adults who are suspected to have dengue fever (e.g. milk, fruit juice, oral rehydration solution, barley, rice water or coconut water) [1] . The authors also postulated that oral fluid intake may have an effect on the severity of dengue [6] . However, causality cannot be confirmed due to the observational nature of this study. Thus, the authors of this study suggested prospective interventional studies be carried out to definitively demonstrate this effect [6] . It is important to confirm this because there are many advantages in encouraging oral fluid intake for suspected dengue patients, in terms of averting the risk of fluid overload with all its complications, cost savings in preventing intravenous fluid and the need for admission and possibly better quality of life when admission is avoided.",

All patients presenting to the clinic with a history of fever for 3 days duration or more were identified by the triage counter nurses. The phases of dengue fever were based on the day of illness: febrile phase-day 1 till day 3 of illness; critical phase-day 4 to day 6 of illness; recovery phase-day 7 of illness onwards. It was standard practice for the clinic that such patients would have a full blood count test done mostly before the patient's consultation with their doctors. Online results of clinical investigations of patients were traced and those fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. The initial assessment of the patients and the subsequent follow-up consultations were conducted by the respective doctors working at the clinic. After the consultation, the researcher and trained research assistants obtained consent from the patient before they were randomized into either the control or intervention group. Simple randomization was done, with a 1:1 allocation ratio, using the table of random numbers. The table of random numbers was a standard table obtained from a statistics textbook. The researchers referred directly to the table during the randomization process (no opaque envelope was used).",

The mean daily fluid intake in the intervention group was 500 ml more than that in study group but this increase was not statistically significant. Although the differences observed did not reach statistical significance, there is a positive trend favouring the intervention group. Moreover, even a small reduction in hospital admission and the need for intravenous fluid for suspected dengue patients can potentially improve the quality of life of patients and cost savings to the economy of dengue endemic countries. The hospitalization rates of patients with suspected dengue fever in this study were 17.6% and 10% in the control and intervention groups respectively. These hospitalization rates were much lower than those during the preceding three months to the recruitment phase: 55.4% in March, 40% in April, and 63.4% in May 2010. [12] A prospective observational study in the same clinic in 2008 enrolled 214 patients aged 16 years and above with 72 hours of undifferentiated fever, 65% of whom had a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of dengue. Of the 140 patients with dengue, 11.4% developed plasma leakage and 37.1% required hospitalization. [13] The marked reduction in hospitalization rates in both the control and intervention groups compared to previous observational studies might be due to the fact that the participants from both groups received instructions from the research team who had read out the advice written on the dengue home care card to each participant. The instruction included specific advice encouraging patients to increase their fluid intake to at least 5 cups of water a day.",

The usual standard practice in primary care would be to give the dengue home care card to the patient with no verbal advice accompanying it, and it is up to the patient to read the card themselves. It is possible that reading out the dengue home care card became an active form of intervention in the control group, thus resulting in the control group participants to drink more fluids than they normally would had they received standard care. This could be a form of double intervention, and the difference in fluid intake between the two groups might be more pronounced if the dengue home care card was not read out to the participants, simulating the standard practice in primary care more closely. Thus, the true impact of the fluid chart on the fluid intake for suspected dengue patients might be underestimated in the current results. However, the intervention group seemed to have consistently maintained a higher mean fluid intake from day 1 to day 6 of the clinic consultations. Another possibility is that there might be other factors influencing the amount of fluid intake consumed by each participant, not just the fluid chart. However, this was not explored in this pilot study. The fluid chart is an intervention tool which was designed to measure and document accurately the patient's fluid intake which they should fill prospectively. By doing this, the patient's awareness of his or her own oral fluid intake should be increased. This increased awareness could be the catalyst for a behavioural change, motivating the patients to increase their oral fluid intake. The improved oral fluid intake could translate into a reduction in morbidity. The reduction in morbidity is evidenced by the observable reduction seen in hospital admission and the reduced requirement for intravenous fluid therapy in the group that was given the fluid chart.",

The 1997 WHO dengue case classification [16] was not applied in primary health care settings because of inherent difficulties as reviewed by Bandyopadhyay et al, 2006 [17] . In the absence of clear guidelines for admission, the need for admission was left to the clinical judgment of the clinician managing the patient in the primary care setting. Due to a limited number of available beds in the infectious disease wards, it was an established practice for primary care clinicians to discuss with their colleagues in the Medical Department before patients were allowed to be admitted. This gate-keeping practice could reduce the number of unnecessary hospitalizations. It could be possible that a number of patients who were admitted would be classified as Dengue Fever (DF) according to the 1997 WHO dengue case classification [16] . However, this would be in keeping with the observations of a multicentre study that recorded 52% of DF patients (447 out of 861) needing intermediate interventions, including admission for intravenous fluid therapy.
