CROSSalign is based on the combination of the Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS) algorithm to predict the RNA secondary structure profile at single-nucleotide resolution and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method to align profiles of different lengths. We applied CROSSalign to investigate the structural conservation of long non-coding RNAs such as XIST and HOTAIR as well as ssRNA viruses including HIV. CROSSalign performs pair-wise comparisons and is able to find homologs between thousands of matches identifying the exact regions of similarity between profiles of different lengths. In a pool of sequences with the same secondary structure CROSSalign accurately recognizes repeat A of XIST and domain D2 of HOTAIR and outperforms other methods based on covariance modeling.

Yet, knowledge of secondary structure provides important insights into the biological function of RNAs by allowing the study of physical properties, such as for instance molecular interactions (Bellucci et al., 2011) . In most cases, information about the RNA folding complements sequence analysis (Wan et al., 2014) and is useful to understand their mechanisms of action. MicroRNA precursors, for example, are processed by DGCR8 only if properly folded in hairpin loop structures (Ha and Kim, 2014) . Similarly, the architecture of ribosomal RNAs evolves in a self-contained way through conservation of stem loops present in ancient species (Bokov and Steinberg, 2009, p. 200; Petrov et al., 2015) , indicating distinct requirements for structural elements.",

The vast majority of lncRNAs seems to evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologs (Diederichs, 2014; Ulitsky, 2016) . Indeed, the average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs between human and mouse is 20% and drops to 5% between human and fish (Ulitsky, 2016) . Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information to study lncRNA conservation and secondary structure could be used for better characterization. Similarly to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly (Chursov et al., 2013) , which indicates that secondary structure investigation could be key to reveal evolutionary properties.",

DTW flexibility allows managing profiles of different lengths without having to sacrifice computational time.

The sequences were then divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set, and we built a list of negative cases by shuffling 25 times the original RepA. Both the positive and negative sets have poor sequence similarity (<35% computed with EMBOSS; see Materials and Methods). We used CROSSalign to compute all scores for the positive and negative set against the corresponding reference set and used the minimal distance to assign the closest match to each transcript.

Importantly, the correct coordinates of human RepA within mouse XIST rank second in our analysis (CROSSalign distance 0.086; p-value < 10 \u22126 ), while the best match is a miRNA-containing the gene Mirg (ENSMUSG00000097391) and the two secondary structure profiles show a strong correlation of 0.92 ( Figure 4B) . Interestingly, even if little information is available on Mirg, the transcript is prevalently expressed in the embryo (Schmitt et al., 2014) . This result unveils a previously unreported relationship between XIST and Mirg, in which structural and functional homologies can be linked. Intriguingly, also the second best result, Rian (ENSMUSG00000097451), is expressed in embryo, while no information is available on the third and fourth hits (ENSMUSG00000107391 and ENSMUSG00000085312).

To avoid biases regarding the length of the profiles, the final CROSSalign distance is normalized for the lengths of both profiles using the internal function normalizedDistance. We also tested different normalizations of DTW outputs (including normalization by length of the shorter or longer profile) and we found that the normalization based on the lengths of both profiles is optimal. The function index was used to visualize the optimal path and to extract the matching coordinates between the two profiles.",

This is the recommended mode when comparing profiles of very different sizes (i.e., one sequence is more than 3 times longer than the other).

The secondary structure of RNA input 1 will be fragmented with a non-overlapping window of 200 nucleotides [optimal size to search secondary structure domains in large RNAs (Lange et al., 2012; Agostini et al., 2013) ] Each fragment of RNA input 1 will then be searched for within the other sequence. This approach is the recommended mode when the user is not interested in the global similarity between two secondary structure profiles, but wants to search for an unknown domain conserved in both sequences. A minimum length of 600 nucleotides is recommended for fragmentation. \u2022 The dataset mode allows the user to search for a single sequence within all the lincRNAs of a specific organism.
