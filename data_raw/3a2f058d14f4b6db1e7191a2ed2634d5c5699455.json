Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus and its components have been evidenced to be associated with cancer of different tissue origin. However, its role in cancer remains unknown. Here, we identified a conserved herpesviral tegument protein known as pUL48 of HCMV, encoding deubiquitinase enzyme, as having a key role in carcinogenesis. We show using deubiquitinase sufficient-and deficient-HCMV that HCMV deubiquitinase is a key in inducing enhanced cellular metabolic activity through upregulation of several anti-apoptotic genes and downregulation of several pro-apoptotic genes expression. Furthermore, HCMV deubiquitinase acquires pro-tumor functions by inhibiting PRR-mediated type I interferon via deubiquitination of TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 and STING. Taken together, our results suggest that HCMV infection may promote oncogenesis by inhibiting innate immunity of the host.",

DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Human Papilloma Virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus cause a wide range of malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and cervical cancer in the host. 1, 2 In addition, RNA viruses such as Hepatitis C Virus, Human Mammary Tumor Virus, Torque Teno Virus and Human Endogenous Retrovirus also acquire different strategies for oncogenesis. 1 A growing list of cancerassociated viruses indicates that viral infection can directly or indirectly bring upon carcinogenic state. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is among those DNA viruses that have been found associated with cancers. 3, 4 However, HCMV has not been characterized as an oncogenic virus. HCMV structural components have been found in tumor tissues [3] [4] [5] and reported to be involved in promoting a favorable microenvironment for oncogenic transformation of infected cells. 6, 7 HCMV infects 90% of the world's population, hence, studying the carcinogenic potential of HCMV and understanding its molecular mechanism may help stop progression of various cancers. Although, HCMV infection is mostly asymptomatic due to host anti-viral immunity, it may lead to oncogenic transformation of normal cells and cancer, when host is immunocompromised owing to immunosuppressive drugs or infection with HIV.",

HCMV-DUB is encoded by unique long48 (UL48) gene, a conserved high-molecular-weight protein across the herpesviruses. We have found that HCMV-DUB inhibits expression of various pro-apoptotic genes and induces expression of anti-apoptotic genes. HCMV-DUB enables cells to surpass the G1-phase rapidly and enter into other phases of cell cycle required for cell division. Cellular DUBs have an important role in many signaling pathways, including immune signaling, apoptosis, oncogenesis and developmental pathways. [12] [13] [14] Likewise, our findings as well reveal that upon infection, HCMV-DUB inhibits synthesis of I-IFNs, an anti-cancer factor, by deubiquitinating several signaling molecules such as TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-6 and -3, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1), interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 or stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that have a key role in anti-viral innate immunity. Inhibition of I-IFNs by HCMV-DUB correlates with decreased expression of several pro-apoptotic genes and increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes, which also indicates its oncogenic potential during infection.",

To investigate the role of HCMV in oncogenesis, non-transformed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with a GFP-tagged laboratory strain of wild-type HCMV (WT-HCMV), AD169 (MOI 5). On second day post infection (dpi), virus infection was observed by GFP fluorescence (Figure 1a ). On sixth dpi, infected cells showed a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) and also change in growth media color (red to yellow) (Figure 1b) . The color change owing at least in part to release of marker GFP from infected cells but also may indicate enhanced metabolic activity during infection. To evaluate the possibility more directly, we performed an MTT assay comparing infected cells with uninfected. A fourfold higher metabolic activity was observed for WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells (Figure 1c ). In addition, an enhanced level of RNA and protein of MKi67, a cell proliferation marker gene, was observed in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with uninfected HFFs (Figures 1d and e) , consistent with the result of MTT assay. This led us to further investigate the cell cycle stages of HCMV-infected cells by flowcytometry, which showed a detectable skewing pattern toward G2-phase in infected cells than in uninfected cells (Figure 1f ). shown in x axis) on 3 dpi, to detect cell cycle stages upon HCMV infection and (g) Anti-apoptotic gene (bcl2, birc3 and prkce) status was compared by qPCR in mock or H-WT infected HFFs on 6 dpi.

To test this, we used a previously reported HCMV mutant virus that encodes an inactive DUB. 19 After infecting HFFs with equal amount of WT and DUB-mutant (\u0394DUB) GFP-tagged HCMV, an equal amount of virus infection (GFP Fluorescence) was observed on second dpi (Figure 2a) . On sixth dpi, \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells showed much lessmetabolic activity than WT-HCMV-infected cells, however, comparable to mock infected cells (Figure 2b ). To confirm the differential responses of WT-and \u0394DUB-HCMV, MTT assay and MKi67 transcript and protein analysis were performed for cell metabolic activity and cell proliferation, respectively, which indicated that \u0394DUB-HCMV reduced cell metabolic activity and proliferation compared with WT-HCMV (Figures 2c-e) . Furthermore, HFF cell counting and cell cycle analysis after three dpi with HCMV, revealed that WT-HCMV infection causes enhanced cell proliferation ( Figure 2f ) and more cell accumulation in the G2-phase compared with mock or \u0394DUB-HCMV infection ( Figure 2g ).",

To understand whether HCMV-DUB modulates pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic gene expressions during infection, WT-HCMV and \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs were first analyzed for the expression of anti-and pro-apoptotic genes through qPCR, on 6th dpi. Transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl2, birc3, prkce, survivin and xiap was significantly increased by many folds, in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, however the transcript level remained either unchanged or reduced in \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with mock ( Figure 3a) . Furthermore, protein-expression analysis of anti-apoptotic genes-bcl2, birc3 and survivin-showed an increased expression in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs than in mock or \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 3c ). Expression level of few other anti-apoptotic genes such as ciap1, cflip and mcl-1 decreased in case of both, WT and \u0394DUB-HCMV infection compared with mock infection (Supplementary Figures S1a-S1c), which suggests HCMV-DUB has no specific role in regulating these anti-apoptotic genes. Surprisingly, transcript level of bcl-xl anti-apoptotic gene was reduced owing to WT-HCMV infection, whereas remained unchanged upon \u0394DUB-HCMV infection (Supplementary Figure S1d) . Similarly, transcription of proapoptotic genes such as trail, Rb, p53, fadd and tnf\u03b1, remained either unchanged, less induced or reduced in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock, whereas expression of these pro-apoptotic genes was higher in the \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells (Figure 3b ). The p53 protein was induced upon infection with both WT-and \u0394DUB-HCMV, however induction was comparatively less in WT-HCMVinfected HFFs (Figure 3c ). Transcription of few other proapoptotic genes such as bad and bax was decreased upon infection with both, WT-and \u0394DUB-HCMV, suggesting no specific role of HCMV-DUB in regulating bad and bax, whereas transcription of caspase-8, and p21 was reduced only in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, and remained unchanged in \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Supplementary Figures S1f-S1i). Furthermore, protein analysis of p21 and caspase-3 showed a decreased expression in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock ( Figure 3c ). The expression of several other anti-and pro-apoptotic genes was tested, with no evidence of differences between WT-and \u0394DUB-HCMVinfected cells compared with mock (Supplementary Figures S1e, S1j-S1l) suggesting no involvement of HCMV infection to regulation of these genes. Differential expression of antiand pro-apoptotic genes during WT-HCMV-and \u0394DUB-HCMV infection indicates that HCMV-pUL48 DUB activity interferes with the induction of apoptosis and may thus induce oncogenic properties. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the ability of anti-cancer drug etoposide to promote apoptosis, was reduced by WT-HCMV infection but not by \u0394DUB-HCMV infection ( Figure 3d ).",

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cells expressing UL48N took-up more 2-NBDG than those expressing Vec or UL48N\u0394DUB (Figure 3e ). Moreover, overexpression of UL48N, increased the cell migration ( Figure 3f ) and tissue invasion (Figure 3g ) of IMR32 cells (tested by wound-healing and matrigel invasion assay, respectively), whereas UL48N\u0394DUB did not induce any of , which suggests that inhibition of pro-apoptotic and induction of antiapoptotic gene expression by WT-HCMV infection, could be due to inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. HCMV induces innate immunity through several PRRs, including endosome localized TLR9 and cytosolic DNA sensors (CDSs). 28-32 TLR9 and CDSs, relay their signals through Myeloid differentiation primary response gene88 (MyD88) and STING, respectively, for the synthesis of I-IFNs. [33] [34] [35] To understand the role of HCMV in I-IFN synthesis and its dependence on MyD88-or STING-pathway, these genes were knocked down in HFFs using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), wherein myd88 and sting transcripts were significantly reduced compared with control shRNA for GFP (Supplementary Figures S2a-S2b ). HFFs deficient in either myd88 or sting were mocked or infected with WT-HCMV for analysis of I-IFN synthesis. WT-HCMV induced the synthesis of IFN\u03b2 in control HFFs whereas reduced the synthesis in mydd88 or sting knocked down HFFs (Figures 4c and d) . This observation suggests that in absence of either MyD88 or STING, induction of I-IFN synthesis is compromised during HCMV infection, which further confirms a dependency on MyD88 and STING for I-IFN synthesis, during HCMV infection.",

All I-IFN promoters increased luciferase production when co-expressed with either the MyD88 or STING gene, however, in all cases the increase was inhibited upon co-expression of UL48N.

Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of HCMV-DUB in affecting the I-IFN-dependent antiviral immunity by transfecting IMR32 cells with UL48N or UL48N\u0394DUB constructs, followed by infecting the cells with New Castle Disease Virus (NDV), 24 h post transfection (hpt). Testing for NDV-replication by quantitative (q)-PCR, showed marked increase in NDV-replication in cells transfected with UL48N but not with UL48N\u0394DUB ( Figure 4j ).

Differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-valueo0.05, **P-valueo0.01 and ***P-valueo0.001, ns, non-significant difference (P-value40.05) HCMV-DUB deubiquitinates cytoplasmic molecules to inhibit I-IFN synthesis and promote carcinogenic properties. The pUL48 contains nuclear localization sequences (NLS), suggesting that differential localization of pUL48N within the cell may be critical for its DUB function and I-IFN inhibition. To test this, NLS-mutant of UL48N was created as described previously 46 and named as UL48N\u0394NLS (Figure 5a) , which was unable to enter the nucleus ( Figure 5b) and was equally efficient DUB as UL48N (Figure 5c ). To analyze the function of UL48N (cytoplasmic or nuclear function) in I-IFN synthesis pathways, I-IFN promoter activity was measured with overexpression of UL48N and UL48N\u0394NLS. To this end, IFN\u03b14 and IFN\u03b2 promoter was activated by co-expression of MyD88 or STING, which are the key molecules of TLR9 or CDS signaling pathways, respectively. UL48N and UL48N\u0394NLS, both inhibited MyD88 or STING-mediated IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b2 promoter activity, respectively (Figures 5d and e) . We hypothesized that UL48N deubiquitinates the cytoplasmic (not the nuclear) signaling molecules activated by PRRs, whose ubiquitination is necessary for induction of I-IFNs. We also compared UL48N\u0394NLS with UL48N in a wound-healing assay and found that wounds of IMR32-monolayers expressing either of the constructs, closed with equal efficiency after 48 h, (Figure 5f ), despite a modest difference in I-IFN inhibiting property. This indicates that NLS of pUL48 is dispensable for the HCMV-DUB induced cell migration observed above (e.g., Figure 3f ). These results show that nuclear localization of UL48N is not required to show inhibitory effect on I-IFN synthesis and cellular migratory activities.",

To facilitate the synthesis of I-IFNs through PRRs, many signaling mediators get K63 (lysine-63) ubiquitinated ( Figure 6a ). As K63 ubiquitination of cytoplasmic molecules is an important event during innate immune signaling, our next approach was to find out the cytoplasmic target molecule whose deubiquitination is facilitated by UL48N and is necessary for inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. To this end, various signaling molecules of the TLR and CDS pathways, undergoing K63 ubiquitination for induction of I-IFNs synthesis, were co-expressed with UL48N or UL48N\u0394DUB in HEK293 cells and were tested for IFN\u03b2 promoter activity by the Luciferase assay. Coexpression of UL48N with TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING, inhibited IFN\u03b2 promoter activity whereas UL48N\u0394-DUB completely rescued the inhibition in case of TRAF3 and IRAK1, and partially rescued in case of TRAF6, IRF7 and STING (Figure 6b ). We concluded that UL48N is able to deubiquitinate multiple signaling molecules to inhibit I-IFN production. Finally, the K63-deubiquitination activity of UL48N was tested by immunoblot analysis using various constructs such as myc-tagged TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING and FLAG-tagged UL48N and UL48N\u0394DUB as indicated in Figure 6c . The result showed that UL48N hugely deubiquitinates TRAF6, TRAF3 and STING ( Figure 6d ) and slightly deubiquitinates IRAK1 (Supplementary Figure S3a) and IRF7 (Supplementary Figure S3b) . Collectively, these results suggest that HCMV-DUB targets various key molecules of the signaling cascade to suppress I-IFN and to induce oncogenesis.",

Studies showed indirect roles of HCMV immediate-early proteins (IE1 and IE2) in oncogenesis, [47] [48] [49] however, lacked the information on underlying molecular mechanism in oncogenesis. Our study suggests that as a consequence of overcoming anti-viral innate immune response, HCMV infection and enzymatic activity of the HCMV-DUB, in particular, may initiate early steps in oncogenesis (Figure 7 ). This conclusion is based on the findings stemming from HCMV-infected cells and extended to transfection experiments done with the HCMV-DUB and specific cellular anti-viral response molecules. We showed Anti-FLAG These observations suggest that differential expressionpattern of anti-or pro-apoptotic genes might be associated with stimuli, stimuli-duration or/and cell type. In addition, it may be possible that in other cell type various other anti-or proapoptotic genes might also be involved in the cell survival signaling upon HCMV infection. Collectively, we observed majority of anti-and pro-apoptotic genes are affected due to HCMV infection in HFFs to protect cells from apoptosis as well as to bring about oncogenesis via overall promoting cell survival and carcinogenic properties.",

Previous studies have also shown HCMV-infected human cells to be resistant to apoptosis as well as uptake more glucose, but with little evidences of tumorigenesis or mechanisms. 47, [49] [50] [51] [52] Several studies show cross-talk between oncogenesis and innate immunity wherein I-IFNs promote apoptosis via expression of pro-apoptotic genes 10, 22 and inhibition of antiapoptotic genes. 10 Other studies suggest that overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes like bcl2 protects cells from I-IFNmediated cell death. 27, 53 In our study, we show WT-HCMVinfected cells express reduced I-IFNs compared with \u0394DUB-HCMV-infected cells, which confirms HCMV-DUB as a key inhibitor of I-IFNs sythesis, that might involve in induction of oncogenic properties in HFFs. We have also shown that UL48-DUB inhibits I-IFN synthesis induced through different PRRsmediated signaling pathways wherein UL48-DUB deubiquitnates signaling mediators such as TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 and STING. Interestingly, in case of TRAF6, IRF7 and STING-mediated induction of I-IFN, N\u0394DUB-UL48 showed a partial repression, which also suggests a DUB-independent role of UL48N in oncogenesis. As HCMV inhibits I-IFN to counteract host innate immunity, 54,55 inhibition of I-IFN synthesis by HCMV indicates its potential to establish a procancer microenvironment. In addition, studies suggest that people having a particular SNP in TLR9 (2848GA) are more susceptible to HCMV infection and cancer development. 29, 56 Here, we have found evidence for hypothetical dual role for HCMV-DUB, in defeating host anti-viral responses and also promoting an oncogenic state.",

PI-based cell cycle flow cytometric analysis was done using FACS Aria III (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and data were analyzed by using FlowJo software version 10 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).Annexin-PE flowcytometry. HFFs were grown to 100% confluence and infected with wild-type and DUB-mutant HCMV. On second dpi, cells were treated with etoposide (30 \u03bcM) and incubated for 24 h. On third dpi cell were trypsinised, harvested, washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS and processed for Annexin-PE Flow Cytometery using the BD Biosciences (Haryana, India) Annexin V apoptosis kit (Cat No# 556422) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Flowcytometric analysis was done using FACS Aria III (Becton Dickinson) and data were analyzed by using FlowJo software version 10 (FlowJo). staining. HCMV-infected HFFs were harvested on 3 dpi, washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS, fixed with 70% chilled ethanol at \u2212 20 o C for 2 h. Cells were washed with staining buffer (1%FBS and 0.09% NaN3 made in 1 \u00d7 PBS). 1:200 dilution of APC labeled Ki67 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA, Cat No.# NB110-89717APC) was used for staining the fixed cells at room temperature. Stained cells were analyzed for MKi67 nuclear staining using FACS Aria III (Becton Dickinson) and data were analyzed by using FlowJo software version 10 (FlowJo). stable cell generation and HFF knockdown. UL48N and UL48N\u0394DUB constructs were prepared by subcloning into pMSCV-puro vector. Transduction of IMR32 cells was performed as described earlier (Tailor et al. 2007). In brief, viral supernatants were prepared in BOSC23 packaging cell line using construct for VSV-G. Cells were spinoculated (2400 rpm, 33\u00b0C, 1 h) with viral supernatants and selected using 0.2 \u03bcg/ml of Puromycin for 48 h.",
