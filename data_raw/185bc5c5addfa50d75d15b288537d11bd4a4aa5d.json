            "text": "The power of forward genetics in yeast is the foundation on which the field of autophagy research firmly stands. Complementary work on autophagy in higher eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel mechanisms by which autophagy is regulated in the context of development, immunity, and neuronal homeostasis. The recent emergence of new clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-based technologies has begun facilitating efforts to define novel autophagy factors and pathways by forward genetic screening in mammalian cells. Here, we set out to develop an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable to CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Genome-wide screening of our reporters in mammalian cells recovered virtually all known autophagy-related (ATG) factors as well as previously uncharacterized factors, including vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), and TMEM41B. To validate this data set, we used quantitative microscopy and biochemical analyses to show that 1 novel hit, TMEM41B, is required for phagophore maturation. TMEM41B is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein distantly related to the established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), and our data show that these two factors play related, albeit not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis. In sum, our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.",

Its most studied form, macroautophagy (hereafter \"autophagy\"), involves the formation of a double-membrane vesicle (the autophagosome) that sequesters cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome by vesicle fusion. The first factors identified in autophagosome biogenesis, the so-called autophagy-related (ATG) factors, were originally identified by genetic screens in yeast [1] [2] [3] . This list eventually matured to its current state that includes approximately 40 yeast ATGs and distinguishes \"core\" factors required for all forms of autophagy from those required only for specific substrates (e.g., a damaged mitochondrion) [4] . The inventory of factors involved in autophagy has been further expanded by the discovery of additional autophagy factors not found in yeast, such as ATG101, EPG5, and vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Whether additional autophagy factors have yet to be discovered remains an open question.",

Initiation involves construction of a cup-shaped precursor membrane (the phagophore) in close apposition to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This process is dependent on the RB1 inducible Coiled-Coil 1 (RB1CC1) scaffolding protein and post-Golgi vesicles containing ATG9A [14] [15] [16] . Next, recruitment of an autophagy-specific phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) complex results in localized phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PI3P) formation and recruitment of PI3P effectors such as WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2) [17, 18] . Nascent phagophores are then elongated concurrent with lipid conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3) family proteins (autophagy-related protein 8 [Atg8] in yeast), although the requirement for LC3 lipidation has recently been challenged [19] [20] [21] .",

This feature of LC3 has been exploited to establish the most widely used reporter of autophagic flux: tandem-fluorescent (tf) LC3 (tfLC3). In this approach, 2 fluorescent protein tags (red fluorescent protein [RFP] and green fluorescent protein [GFP] ) are appended to the amino terminus of LC3. Upon lysosomal delivery of tfLC3, low pH conditions within the lysosomal lumen selectively quench GFP fluorescence, resulting in a dramatic increase in the observed Red:Green fluorescence ratio [23, 24] . In a similar manner, tf sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) has been used to measure the flux of this heavily studied autophagy receptor [24] .",

With this expanded toolkit in hand, we performed genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to identify selective autophagy factors in mammalian cells.

We validated our list using quantitative cell microscopy and biochemical analyses to define transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) as an integral ER membrane protein that is required for phagophore maturation in higher eukaryotes.

To devise a general strategy for monitoring autophagic flux in K562 cells, we began by constructing 6 homologous gene cassettes: 1 (tfLC3) encoding an N-terminal, tf (RFP-GFP) fusion with LC3B, 4 (tfSQSTM1, tfNDP52, tfTAX1BP1, and tfNBR1) with N-terminal fusions to SQSTM1-related autophagy receptors, and 1 (tfEmpty) as a negative control (S1A Fig) . The RFP to GFP fluorescence ratio (Red:Green ratio) of tfLC3 is a widely used metric for autophagic flux predicated on the selective quenching of GFP in low pH environments, such as the lysosomal lumen ( Fig 1A) . Following cassette integration at the adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus, we analyzed cells by flow cytometry under basal conditions and following treatment with either Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, or torin, a smallmolecule inducer of autophagy. Corresponding changes in the observed Red:Green ratio of tfLC3 and tfReceptors provided strong evidence for both basal and induced autophagy in K562 cells (Fig 1B) . By contrast, the Red:Green ratio of tfEmpty cells was unresponsive to either drug treatment, arguing that nonselective reporter engulfment makes a negligible contribution to our flux measurements. We obtained similar results using adherent human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (S1B Fig) . Furthermore, we confirmed that torin-induced increases in Red:Green ratio were due to selective GFP quenching (S1C Fig) and that both basal and induced autophagy were dependent on the known autophagy-related factors RB1CC1 and ATG13 (S1D and S1E Fig) . Collectively, these data validated a broad panel of autophagic flux reporters for subsequent use as genetic screening tools in K562 cells.",

            "text": "From the global analysis of gene hits (Fig 2B) , we made multiple observations that validated our genetic screening approach. First, virtually all known ATG factors were identified as required for reporter flux. Second, we observed the expected phenotype for positive and negative regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a potent inhibitor of autophagy signaling. Third, we could distinguish protein complexes implicated in autophagy from related complexes with shared subunits. For example, our analysis distinguished the autophagic role of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex from the related class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex. Similarly, hits in the BLOC-one-related complex (BORC) disrupted autophagy, but we found no hits among subunits specific to the related biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC-1) (Fig 2B) . Genome-wide CRISPR screening using tfReporters reveals known and novel regulators of basal autophagy. (A) Schematic depicting a pooled CRISPR screening strategy for defining genetic modifiers of tfReporters (tfLC3 and tfReceptors) under basal conditions. K562 cells expressing Cas9 were transduced with the Brunello lentiviral sgRNA library. The top and bottom third of cells were collected based on Red:Green ratio. sgRNA sequences from collected cells were obtained by Illumina sequencing and analyzed by MAGeCK. (B) Shown is a heat map of averaged beta scores (similar to fold-enrichment) for the indicated sgRNAs. Scores are color coded based on the effect of the indicated sgRNA (red, sgRNA suppresses autophagy; blue, sgRNA enhances autophagy). For comparison, known ATG factors (regardless of effect size) are presented alongside novel hits. Genes are clustered loosely based on their known function. sgRNAs listed under \"other\" (e.g., TMEM41B) were chosen from targets whose beta scores placed them in the top approximately 50 hits for 1 or more reporters. sgRNAs listed under \"enhancer sgRNAs\" target the 6 genes that scored better than the highest-scoring known autophagy regulator, MLST8. Underlying read counts and beta scores are presented in S2 Data and S3 Data, respectively. An interactive interface for data is also available online at http://crispr.deniclab.com. ATG, autophagy-related; Cas9, CRISPR-associated protein 9; CRISPR, Our screening approach also identified several uncharacterized factors as strong modifiers of autophagy. To examine these hits further, we retested them as individual sgRNAs alongside a broad panel of known ATG factors (Fig 3A; S2A-S2D Fig) . Indeed, the vast majority of individual sgRNAs increased or decreased flux proportionate to their beta score ranking (compare Fig 3B and Fig 2B) . By contrast, we found that sgRNAs targeting uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) were spurious hits that modified the Red:Green ratio by drastically enhancing RFP fluorescence (S2E Fig). We also confirmed that tfNBR1 flux in K562 cells was largely independent of ATG factors required for LC3 lipidation (e.g., ATG7), which agrees with our original screen findings (Fig 3B) . ATG7-independent autophagosome formation has been reported in other cell types, and our work suggests that NBR1 might provide a useful new marker for further dissecting this process [28] [29] [30] . In sum, our genetic screening strategy and hit validation robustly uncovered known ATG factors and unveiled new candidates for further study.",

To define the stage of autophagosome formation that is arrested in TMEM41B KO cells, we used a series of complementary approaches to systematically probe the autophagosome biogenesis pathway. The accumulation of lipidated LC3 in clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B; MAGeCK, modelbased analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout; MLST8, MTOR associated protein LST8 homolog; sgRNA, single guide RNA; tf, tandem-fluorescent; TMEM41B, transmembrane protein 41B; VMP1, vacuole membrane protein 1. TMEM41B KO cells is inconsistent with an initiation defect ( Fig 4A) . To further support this view, we analyzed the kinase activity of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a component of the RB1CC1 complex that regulates phagophore nucleation [33] . Upon autophagy induction, ULK1 phosphorylates numerous substrates including ATG13. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serine-318 (p-S318) in ATG13 can serve as a proxy for ULK1 activity [34, 35] . We found that activation of autophagy by torin stimulated the appearance of p-S318 comparably in wild-type and TMEM41B KO cells (S4A Fig). For comparison, this assay robustly Next, to determine whether initiated phagophores matured properly in TMEM41B KO cells, we turned to a protease protection assay ( Fig 5A) [36] . In this assay, properly sealed autophagosomes protect their cargo from proteolysis by an exogenous protease. Cells were treated with BafA1 for 18 h to accumulate autophagosomes prior to lysis by mechanical disruption. As expected, in wild-type extracts, the autophagy receptor NDP52 was protease resistant until membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 (a nonionic detergent). By contrast, NDP52 was protease sensitive in native extracts derived from TMEM41B KO cells and RB1CC1 KO control cells, consistent with a failure to properly form completed autophagosomes ( Fig 5B) . We obtained similar results when we analyzed protease protection of LC3-II (S4B and S4C Fig) . In sum, these data suggest that TMEM41B is required for phagophore maturation.",

Consistent with our earlier biochemical approaches (Fig 4, Fig  5; S3 Fig, S4 Fig) , we found that TMEM41B KO cells displayed approximately 5.5-fold more LC3+ punctae than wild-type cells under basal conditions (Fig 6A and 6B ).

On the basis of these similarities, we hypothesized that TMEM41B and VMP1 have related activities. To examine this possibility, we looked for increased association of certain ATG factors with ER membranes in the absence of TMEM41B, a hallmark of arrested autophagosome biogenesis in VMP1 KO cells [41] . Indeed, following differential centrifugation of cell lysates (Fig 8A) , we observed a shift in the migration of WIPI2, RB1CC1, and ATG9A from the high-speed pellet (p100) to lower-speed pellets containing ER-derived membranes (p3 and p20) in both VMP1 KO and TMEM41B KO cells ( Fig  8B) .

Here, we combined CRISPR screening with an expanded toolkit of tf reporters to identify novel factors required for mammalian autophagy. These data are freely available in their entirety as an interactive resource at http://crispr.deniclab.com. Defining the genetic landscape of mammalian autophagy Our screens recovered virtually all known ATG factors as well as uncharacterized factors, including TMEM41B. In follow-up studies, we showed that TMEM41B is an ER integral membrane protein critical for autophagic flux in multiple human cell lines. Using complementary biochemical and fluorescence-microscopy-based assays, we detected the accumulation of unsealed, LC3+, WIPI2-positive autophagy intermediates in cells ablated for TMEM41B (Figs 5 and 6). Furthermore, our ultrastructural analysis by CLEM found that these intermediates correspond to a collection of thin (approximately 50 nm) membranous sheets, tubules, and vesicles, which are hallmarks of immature isolation membranes (Fig 7) [15].",

VMP1 is absent in yeast but is generally conserved in higher eukaryotes. In Dictyostelium and other model eukaryotes, cells lacking VMP1 display diverse phenotypes, including defects in autophagy, membrane contact sites, ion homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and phosphoinositide distribution [6, 40, 41, [50] [51] [52] .

Consistent with the results herein, both observed similarities between TMEM41B and VMP1 deletions. On the basis of these phenotypic similarities, one immediate hypothesis is that TMEM41B and VMP1 function as a complex. Indeed, Morita and colleagues were able to isolate a VMP1/TMEM41B-containing co-complex in the presence of n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS) [53] , although such a complex was not observed in other detergents [54, 55] . It remains an important future goal to establish whether TMEM41B's function is dependent on its interaction with VMP1. A potential clue comes from studies of DedA proteins in Escherichia coli, which share pfam09335 with TMEM41B and VMP1 [56] and are distantly related to bacterial LeuT transporters [57] . E. coli cells lacking the DedA homologs YqjA and YghB have a defect in proton import that can be rescued by overexpressing a Na + /K + -H + antiporter [58, 59] . Future biochemical and structural studies of VMP1 and TMEM41B will provide new tools for testing their potentially conserved role in ion homeostasis.",

These include novel inducers of autophagy, receptor-specific modulators, and additional putative ATG factors. Vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A) and VPS25 are 2 factors in the latter category known to assemble into endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). ESCRT components have long been implicated in autophagy and may function at several steps during autophagosome biogenesis, as well as during autophagosome-endolysosomal fusion [66, 67] . Many ESCRT components are required for cell division, which complicates analysis of their mutant phenotypes. By contrast, VPS37A is nonessential and offers a potential future handle for further dissecting the mechanistic details of ESCRT's role in mammalian autophagy.",

Using this Gaussian fit, we predicted the probability that each pixel in the smoothed green channel z-stack for each field corresponded to background (noncell) or foreground (cell). We assigned each pixel with a p(background) < 10 \u22125 to the cells, thus creating a \"cell mask.\" After removing small specks (<100,000 pixels volume) to eliminate debris, we removed out-of-focus planes from the cell mask using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as described previously [71] . Next, nuclei were segmented from the blue (DAPI) channel by slice-by-slice relative thresholding followed by watershed segmentation using the pyto_segmenter package. Cells were segmented using watershed segmentation from nuclei seeds. Cell edges were eroded to eliminate blurred edge excess included during the p-value transformation. Cells contacting the edge of the field were removed from analysis. Next, punctae were segmented in the green and red (561 nm) channels using the pyto_segmenter package with empirically determined Canny edge detection thresholds. The number of total punctae and punctae overlapping with objects in the other fluorescence channel were counted, and tabulated data were saved in .csv format. Plotting was performed using R and the ggplot2 package. See the image analysis package for details.

To substantiate this interpretation, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as an alternative method of visualizing arrested autophagosomal intermediates at an ultrastructural level. Analysis by TEM revealed the accumulation of single-membrane vesicles (approximately 140 nm in diameter) in TMEM41B KO cells but not in wild-type cells (S6A Fig). However, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) demonstrated that fluorescent LC3 punctae did not correlate with these vesicles but rather with a distinct population of smaller (approximately 50 nm) vesicles (Fig 7A). Three-dimensional reconstruction of electron miscroscopy tomographs containing LC3+ structures revealed a rudimentary collection of membranous sheets, tubules, and vesicles, reminiscent of immature isolation membranes [15] (Fig 7B; S6B and S6C Fig).
