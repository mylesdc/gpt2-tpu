            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. It represents an important public health problem in early development, with high mortality and morbidity among children under five years of age. 1 ARIs are classified as upper respiratory tract infections or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) depending on the airways predominately involved. 2 Although ARIs can be caused by bacteria or fungi, viral infections are responsible for most of them. Several viruses have been consistently identified during ARIs: influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (ADV), coronavirus (HCoV), enterovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 3 Moreover, viral infections are one of the many risk factors associated with wheezing illnesses and exacerbation of respiratory diseases in children of all ages. 4 HRV has been associated with these exacerbations, including cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, oxygen use, and length of hospital stay. 5, 6 In addition, asthma inception and exacerbation had been associated with HRV [7] [8] [9] and HMPV infection, 10 with some reports estimating that approximately 60% of cases are associated with HRV infection. 11 Human rhinovirus have been classified into two genetic species: HRV-A (including 76 serotypes) and HRV-B (including 25 serotypes). However, recently, HRV-C has been included. HRV-A and HRV-B are associated with the common cold, whereas the role of HRV-C is relatively unknown, but recent reports suggest that HRV-Cs may be more pathogenic than other HRVs. [12] [13] [14] Virus identification and molecular characterization is fundamental for epidemiological surveillance and control, but also for diagnostic purposes that may lead to specific therapy and an adequate response to treatment because clinical manifestations of virus and bacteria associated with ARI overlap considerably except in epidemic situations. 15 The aim of this study was to determine the association of each type of respiratory viruses with acute hypoxemic respiratory disease mainly asthma acute exacerbation or pneumonia in children admitted to a reference respiratory center in Mexico City during three different seasons.",

As HRVs are often considered to be of little health impact and clinical significance, this type of studies is essential to know the genomics, epidemiology, and clinical impact of the HRV-C strains in order to be capable of confronting and even predicting future outbreaks and be able to respond in a fast and effective way, especially in developing countries.",
