Often orthologs of functional receptors are present in a wide range of species, but amino acid differences can render these receptors nonfunctional. In some cases amino acid differences result in additional N-linked glycosylation that blocks virus infection. The latter block to retrovirus infection can be overcome by treatment of cells with compounds such as tunicamycin, which prevent the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides.",

These receptors perform a wide variety of cellular functions and can be single-transmembrane, GPI-anchored, or multiple-membrane-spanning proteins. The presence or absence of functional receptors on the cell surface is a major determinant of virus tropism. In some cases, otherwise functional receptors are glycosylated and therefore unusable by particular retroviruses [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Since these sites of glycosylation are often near the binding sites used by viruses, glycosyla-tion is thought to be an important defense mechanism evolved by cells in their battle against virus infection (for example see [7] ).",

The receptor for RD114 in tunicamycin-treated NIH 3T3 cells is a multiple-membrane spanning protein called ASCT1 (standard name SLC1A4), which is a neutral amino acid transporter [5] . RD114 also uses a closely related human protein, ASCT2 (standard name SLC1A5, also called RDR) as a receptor [8, 9] .

We wanted to extend these observations by examining the effects of PS on virus entry in the case where the receptor was present but was inactive due to receptor glycosylation. We used the LAPSN retroviral vector [16] that encodes human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) as a marker for infection. Viruses carrying this vector contained Gag-Pol proteins from MoMLV and Env proteins from either MoMLV or RD114. For simplicity we will call these viruses MoMLV or RD114 vectors, respectively. MoMLV vectors are unable to enter CHO cells and RD114 vectors are unable to enter NIH 3T3 cells unless these cells are first treated with tunicamycin to prevent receptor glycosylation [3] [4] [5] . Table 1 shows that pretreatment of CHO and NIH 3T3 cells with 400 \u00b5M PS for 24 h allowed efficient entry of MoMLV and RD114 vectors, respectively.

As described above, murine ASCT1 functions as a receptor for RD114 in NIH 3T3 cells treated with tunicamycin [5] . Treatment of cell lysates with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) causes an increase in the electrophoretic mobility of ASCT1 as a result of removal of the N-linked glycosylation [14] . We attempted to examine the glycosylation status of a myc-tagged ASCT1 protein in NIH 3T3 cells but were unable to clearly visualize the protein due to technical problems including high background antibody binding. However, we were able to examine the glycosylation state of a hemagglutinin (HA)tagged human ASCT2 protein in NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells ( Figure 1A ). In the non-PS treated cells there was a clear increase in mobility of ASCT2 when incubated with PNGase F, demonstrating that this protein is normally glycosylated. Furthermore, none of the protein is found in the unglycosylated state prior to PNGase F treatment. The same mobility shifts were observed in cells treated with PS, indicating that treatment with PS does not affect the glycosylation state of this protein in NIH 3T3 cells.",

If this were true, the effect should happen relatively quickly since all that is required is for the PS liposomes to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell and change the physical characteristics of the membrane. We undertook infections using RD114 vector on normally infectable NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells given only a short exposure to PS, in contrast to the 24 h treatment used in previous experiments. Cells were treated with PS for 1 h, virus was added for 2 h, and the cells were trypsinized and replated. With only 1 h of PS treatment, virus infection was increased almost 4-fold. This experiment was repeated twice with the same results. While not as much as the full 10 to 20-fold increase in infection when treated for 24 h, this demonstrates that the effect of PS on virus infection is indeed rapid.

Importantly, this occurs without removal of the oligosaccharide itself, unlike the case with tunicamycin treatment. Furthermore, this glycosylation-specific effect takes place in NIH 3T3 cells on a different timescale than the non-specific enhancement of virus infection by PS, and appears to require a threshold concentration of cellsurface PS. When NIH 3T3 cells are treated with 200 \u00b5M PS, they reach the same level of infectivity after 24 h as when treated with 400 \u00b5M PS, but take longer before infection is observable, suggesting that the observed enhancement of infection is not merely a signaling cascade initiated by the addition of PS to the cell. One explanation for such a long delay is that de novo protein synthesis is required for the glycosylation-specific effect of PS treatment. Additional experiments will be needed to address this question. Unfortunately, preliminary experiments have demonstrated that PS treatment combined with inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide is lethal to cells (data not shown), further complicating this analysis.",

Several groups have suggested that receptor clusters, or multivalent Env-receptor complexes are required for retrovirus infection [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . For example, an ASLV-A virion appears to require multiple contacts with receptors in order to enter a fusogenic state [21] . It is Effects of PS concentration on cell-surface PS levels and RD114 vector infection of NIH 3T3 or NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells NIH 3T3 cells possible that glycosylated receptors are normally unable to pack as tightly, or move through the membrane as rapidly as their unglycosylated forms in order to facilitate virus infection. In this model, the disruption to the plasma membrane caused by PS treatment could allow sufficient concentrations of receptor to contact the viral Env proteins and initiate fusion. Exogenous PS has been shown to affect the curvature and stability of a lipid bilayer, providing a mechanism for this disruption [22, 23] . On the other hand, fewer receptor contacts could be required by the virus to form a fusion pore if the activation energy for fusion to occur has been lowered by PS treatment [15] . Similarly, it is possible that the glycosylation of the receptors prevents the membranes from coming in close enough contact to fuse, but that the destabilization of the plasma membrane by PS increases the distance at which this fusion can occur. Further study will be required to understand the mechanism of glycosylation-specific enhancement of virus entry through PS treatment.",
