Recent studies have showed that microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs of length ranging from 18-23 nucleotides (nt) participate in hostpathogen interaction networks; however, whether or not miRNAs are involved in MEV infection has not been reported. Our study revealed that miRNA miR-181b inhibited replication of MEV in the feline kidney (F81) cell line by targeting the MEV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) messenger RNA (mRNA) coding region, resulting in NS1 translational repression, while MEV infection reduced miR-181b expression. This is the first description of cellular miRNAs modulating MEV infection in F81 cells, providing further insight into the mechanisms of viral infection, and may be useful in development of naturally-occurring miRNAs antiviral strategies.",

MEV, a subspecies of the feline parvovirus (FPV), contains a single-stranded negative sense DNA genome of about 5 kb, with 2 main open reading frames (ORFs) [1] . As do other parvoviruses, MEV causes a highly infectious acute disease and has a high rate of morbidity and mortality in mink [2] [3] [4] . Certain MEV vaccines have been used with some success to prevent further spread of the viral disease with significant decreases in morbidity and mortality [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, due to the genetic variability of the virus these vaccines are becoming increasingly inadequate and a simpler approach to controlling MEV infection would be advantageous.",

In plants, they target mRNAs by precise or nearly precise complementary base pairing, and cleave target mRNAs directly [14] . In animals, being mostly imprecisely complementary to their mRNA targets, they often show translational repression and then lead to mRNA degradation [10, 15, 16] . Recent studies have also noted the role of miRNAs as modulators in host-pathogen interaction networks [17, 18] . Cellular miRNA hsa-miR-146a facilitates proliferation of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus by down regulation of an interferon-related gene [19] . Cellular hsa-miR-29a inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by targeting the viral Nef mRNA directly [20] . miR-323, miR-491 and miR-654 from both 293T and MDCK cells target the same region in H1N1 influenza virus PB1 mRNAs, thereby affecting the ability of the latter to replicate [21] . Virus-encoded miRNAs also play roles in viral infection. EB virus-derived miRNA miR-BART2 decreases replication of EB virus by targeting viral DNA polymerase BALF5 [22] . miR-BART22 helps EB virus evade the host immune response by reducing levels of EB virus latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) [23] . Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoding miR-US25-1c blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S phase by down regulating cyclin E2, BRCC3, EID1, MAPRE2, and CD147 to help the virus create a cellular environment conducive to DNA replication [24] .",

At the indicated times, virus titer and genomic DNA levels were examined. As anticipated, miR-181b mimics inhibited viral growth and this was most evident 36 h post MEV infection, at which time the virus titer was significantly suppressed almost 8-fold by miR-181b mimics, while the inhibitors tended to prevent the inhibitory activity of the endogenous miR-181b on viral growth but the effect was very minor and not significant (Figure 2A) . From 12 h post MEV infection, the level of viral genomic DNA was significantly down regulated by miR-181b mimics: by 36 h inhibition was almost 3-fold, while the miR-181b inhibitors did not show any effect at earlier timepoints of MEV infection but at 36 h they blocked endogenous miR-181b function and restored the viral growth rate significantly. By 36 h post infection, the level of the genomic DNA had increased 25% as compared with transfection by NC inhibitors ( Figure 2B ). Since all members of the same miRNA family share the same targets [39] , we reasoned that the other two members (miR-181c and miR-181d) of the miR-181 family predicted from sequencing data would inhibit MEV replication. Results from virus titration and viral genomic DNA quantification showed that miR-181d mimics, like miR-181b mimics, could inhibit MEV growth, but restoration of the endogenous miR-181d function by miR-181d inhibitors was not detected (Figure S2A, B) . Surprisingly, miR-181c mimics did not affect MEV replication ( Figure S2D, E) . Since at 36 h post MEV infection the effect of miR-181b was the most apparent, flow cytometry, CPE and MEV indirect immunofluorescence assays were also carried out at that time. Flow cytometry showed that, compared with transfection with NC mimics, miR-181b mimics significantly decreased the proportion of MEV infected cells by almost half (Figure 2C) . Microscopically, miR-181b mimics significantly reduced MEV-induced CPE in F81 cells in comparison with NC mimics, showing more closely growing, more viable intact and fewer irregular dead cells, while miR-181b inhibitors increased CPE ( Figure 2D ). MEV indirect immunofluorescence assay also showed that miR-181b mimics decreased, and miR-181b inhibitors increased, the quantity of fluorescence ( Figure 2E ). Altogether, these results clearly show that cellular endogenous miR-181b has a negative effect on MEV replication.",

            "text": "To confirm that miR-181b could directly target region 334-342 of NS1 mRNA and show inhibitory activity, a reporter vector pGL3-181t containing the potential target segment in the 39UTR of the luciferase gene was constructed ( Figure 3A ). After cotransfection of F81 cells with pGL3-181t and miR-181b mimics or inhibitors, the relative luciferase activity was measured. As predicted, miR-181b significantly inhibited the relative luciferase activity (by more than half) in comparison with NC mimics, while the inhibitors increased it (more than 2-fold) ( Figure 3B ). To provide further evidence that miR-181c did not act like miR-181b, the above experiment was repeated using miR-181c mimics. As previously shown, miR-181c did not affect the relative luciferase activity ( Figure 3B ). To further ascertain the necessary function of complementary seed sequence, a seed reporter vector, mut pGL3-181t, with a mutated tetranucleotide was constructed and the corresponding mut-1 miR-181b mimics and inhibitors were synthesized ( Figure 3A ). After co-transfection of F81 cells, as expected, miR-181b mimics and inhibitors did not affect the relative expression activity of mut pGL3-181t, but mut-1 miR-181b mimics did down regulate it by more than 2-fold ( Figure 3C ). To test whether MEV and the NS1 expression vector pcDNA-NS1 could interact with miR-181b, thereby competing with the reporter vectors, the treated cells were infected with MEV following co-transfection with the luciferase reporter vector and miRNA mimics. In addition, cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector, miRNA mimics and pcDNA-NS1. Results showed that both MEV and pcDNA-NS1 restored the inhibition of the relative expression activity of pGL3-181t vector by miR-181b mimics but did not contribute to the relative expression activity of mut pGL3-181t vector by mut-1 miR-181b mimics ( Figure 3D ). Although the miR-181b target site in the 39 UTR of the luciferase gene is not representative of its position in the NS1 coding region, these results indicate that cellular miR-181b can directly target MEV NS1 mRNA coding region through a 9 nucleotide complementary seed. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of MEV NS1 expression by miR-181b, the NS1 coding region was cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His A vector, generating an NS1 carbon terminal fusion with a His tag expression vector (pcDNA-NS1). F81 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-NS1 and miR-181b mimics or inhibitors, with NC mimics or inhibitors as controls. At 36 h posttransfection, RIPA lysis buffer (HX-BIO) was added and the protein lysates were harvested and subjected to western blot assay. Results showed that miR-181b significantly decreased NS1 protein levels by almost 40%, and miR-181b inhibitors enhanced these by about 20% (Figure 4A ). However, NS1 mRNA, as measured by qPCR assay, was unaffected by either miR-181b mimics or inhibitors at 36 h post-transfection ( Figure 4B ). Altogether, these results demonstrate that cellular miR-181b inhibits MEV NS1 expression resulting in translational repression. To further confirm the significance of target sequence in decreased NS1 expression, mut pcDNA3.1-NS1 was constructed. The nucleotide sequence of the target, but not the amino acid sequence, of the NS1 gene was altered and the mut-2 miR-181b mimics (in which the 3nucleotide mutation was complementary to mut pcDNA-NS1 and mut pBM/rMEV) were synthesized ( Figure 4C ). To check whether miR-181b could affect mut NS1 expression, mut pcDNA3.1-NS1 and miR-181b mimics or inhibitors were used to co-transfect F81 cells, using NC mimics and inhibitors as the respective controls. At 36 h post-transfection, RIPA lysis bufferextracted protein lysates were harvested and a western blot assay performed. Results showed that miR-181b could not affect mut NS1 protein translation ( Figure 4D ). To test if mut-2 miR-181b mimics could restore the inhibition of mut NS1 expression, mut pcDNA3.1-NS1 and mut-2 miR-181b mimics were used to cotransfect F81 cells, with NC mimics as a control. Results showed that mut NS1 expression level was significantly down regulated by more than 50% by the mut-2 miR-181b mimics in comparison with NC mimics. miR-181c and miR-181d were also tested for their ability to attenuate NS1 protein expression. As anticipated, miR-181d mimics significantly down regulated NS1 expression but miR-181c did not ( Figure S2C , F). Altogether, these results demonstrate that cellular miR-181b inhibits MEV NS1 expression resulting in translational repression by targeting the predicted site of MEV NS1 mRNA.",

Results showed that miR-181b, miR-181d and miR-301a were significantly decreased by almost 50% after MEV infection, and miR-29b and miR-125b significantly increased by over 30% ( Figure 7A ). Although changes in the expression of most (10 of 14) of the randomly selected miRNAs except miR-99b, miR-26a, miR-21 and miR-29a were consistent with the sequencing data, the magnitude of changes was different for some miRNAs, especially miR-29b. To further confirm that miR-181b was down regulated following MEV infection, the expression of miR-181b was measured at times after MEV infection. It was found that miR-181b gradually decreased with increasing MEV infection time ( Figure 7B ). These observations demonstrate that MEV infection regulates cellular miRNAs including miR-181b.",

Until now, however, no such observations have been reported on single-stranded DNA parvoviruses. Here, our studies have shown that one kind of cellular miRNA, miR-181b, inhibits MEV replication by directly targeting the NS1 coding region resulting in repression of mRNA miR-181b Inhibits Mink Enteritis Virus Replication translation. As recently reported [15, 16, 47, 48] , translational repression is the primary event, followed by mRNA degradation. However, according to the data in Figure 4B , the NS1 mRNA level was unaffected by either miR-181b mimics or inhibitors at 36 h post-transfection. The reason might be that the change of NS1 mRNA quantity level was too low to be detected.",

In our study, however, the relative luciferase activity of reporter vector pGL3-181t, NS1 protein expression and MEV replication was modulated by miR-181d but not miR-181c ( Figure S2 ). The target prediction results showed that miR-181b and miR-181d had 9 sequential complementary nucleotides, whereas miR-181c had 7 (Figure 1 ). Although 7 nucleotides have been reported as being sufficient for inhibition of gene expression [61] , it appeared that 9 were required in this case. In addition, different base pairing structures between miR-181b and miR-181c in the NS1 target sit might be related to the function of miRNAs [39] . Since miR-181b and miR-181d differ in only one nucleotide, it is possible that they have the same activity. However, following transfection with miR-181d inhibitors, elimination of the inhibitory activity of endogenous miR-181d was not detected ( Figure S2D , E, F). One possible reason is that the endogenous miR-181d expression level was insufficiently high (,100 copies/cell; i.e., about 10-fold lower than that of miR-181b) to have any function ( Figure S1A ), and therefore miR-181b played the main role in MEV infection.",

Results showed that expression of miR-181b was lowest in intestinal tissues, especially of the large intestine. It may be that the large intestine is the organ most susceptible to infection with MEV. This is simply an inference, however, since besides targeting MEV, miR-181b has also been reported to produce degradation of some cellular targets such as PTEN, CYLD, BCL2, p27 and TIMP3 [62] [63] [64] [65] . Now that miR-181b has been shown to inhibit MEV infection, it may find application as an antiviral therapeutic for MEVinduced mink enteritis. As many studies have shown [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] , siRNAs can be used to treat virus diseases in vivo; however, little attention has so far been paid to the possibility of using endogenous miRNAs as an antivirus tool. Compared with siRNAs, endogenous miRNAs might be much safer and induce fewer sideeffects. More extensive studies are merited to determine if miR-181b can be used as an antiviral tool.",
