Positive samples confirmed by reverse transcription PCR using specific primers against the PEDV M gene were inoculated on Vero cells for succession cultivation. Viral RNA of the 40-s passaged viruses were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) according to standard protocol. Twenty-five pairs of primers overlapping the whole PEDV genome were designed for sequencing the complete PEDV genomes (8) . Sequences at the 5=-end of the isolates were obtained with the 5= RACE kit, and those at the 3=-end were amplified using an Oligo(dT) primer with an adapter at the 5=terminal. All of the sequencing reactions were done in duplicate, and all sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands.",

The complete genomic sequence identity of the two PEDV isolates reached 99.9%, and their genomic organizations were found to be the same as the attenuated strain DR13(JQ0233162). However, there was a 24-amino-acid (aa) deletion in open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) of strain JSLS-1/2015. This differs from strain HUA-14PED96, which contained a 72-nt deletion in ORF1a. We cannot be sure whether the deletion in ORF1b is attributed to the virulence of the isolate. Besides, the isolates had the same aa deletions as strain CV777 at aa sites 59 to 62 and at sites 141 and 163 in the S gene and showed 94.8% to 99.7% homologies to the PEDV strains in the G1 group. Comparison with previously published M gene reports in China showed that JSLS-1/2015 and JS-2/2015 are most closely related to strains HLJ-2012 (99.8%) and BJ-2012-1 (99.9%), respectively. Moreover, N gene alignment reports indicated that the sequences of the two strains had identities above 99.5% with the attenuated DR13 strain, and E gene homology analysis showed a 100% identity between JSLS-1/2015 and the attenuated DR13 strain and 99.5% identity between JS-2 and the attenuated DR13 strain. Further analysis of the genetic evolution of the ORF3 genes found that there were 51 nt deleted in both the JSLS-1/2015 and JS-2/2016 strains, which is a common feature among the attenuated strains.",
