[5] [6] [7] [8] Inactivated and live-attenuated influenza vaccines offer both direct and herd benefits to vaccinated children, their contacts and the broader community. [9] [10] [11] Several studies have shown that children attending child care centres (CCCs) are at greater risk of ARI including influenza. [12] [13] [14] [15] In 2008, formal child care was undertaken by 9% of Australian children aged <1 year, 35% aged 1 year and 47% aged 2-3 years. 16 In order to determine the health, social and economic effects of influenza vaccination in young children, we planned a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an unadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine in children aged 6-35 months who attended a CCC in metropolitan Sydney during 2010. However, because of the 2009 pandemic, the Australian government recommended and funded universal use of inactivated pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination for those aged >6 months in 2010. Hence, a RCT design became unethical. The study was restructured to a prospective cohort design addressing the epidemiology of ILIs among young children.",

Parents reported influenza vaccinations their children had received and, where possible, the influenza vaccination status was validated from vaccination records.

During the ILI follow-up period, parents were asked to report to us whenever a subject child developed an ILI, defined as fever \u226537\u00c18\u00b0C or feeling feverishness according to the carer's assessment, plus at least one of the following symptoms: cough, rhinorrhoea/nasal congestion, sore throat. During the ILI-reporting period, each family received a weekly e-mail, text message or telephone call to remind them to contact the study team immediately if a child developed an ILI. Before the ILIreporting period, e-mail addresses and mobile telephone numbers of all parents/guardians were confirmed with parents/guardians to ensure that they received messages. In addition, during the 1 week of the ILI-reporting period, all parents/guardians were contacted/recontacted until they indicated that they had received the message that the ILIreporting period had commenced. Parents/guardians were provided with plastic shaft rayon-budded swabs and plastic transport tubes with a foam pad reservoir soaked in viral transport medium (Virocult MW950; Medical Wire & Equipment, Wiltshire, UK). They were given verbal and written instructions on how to collect a nose swab and a throat swab from the subject whenever an ILI occurred. We asked for a nose swab to be done first and did not insist on a throat swab if the parents felt uncomfortable to collect one. Parents mailed swabs to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory (QPID), where they were stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until tested. Swabs were tested for 19 respiratory viruses by qualitative  real-time PCR, 17-19 including influenza viruses A and B (Flu  A, Flu B), adenovirus (AV), human rhinovirus (HRV),  polyomaviruses (JCV, BKV, WUV, KIV), parainfluenza  viruses 1, 2, 3 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3) , coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), bocavirus (BV) and human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (hRSV A, hRSV B). All RNA virus assays used Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR, Qiagen (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), and all DNA virus assays used Qiagen Quantitect Probe PCR Mix, Qiagen, Australia. In order to assess extraction quality, specimens were spiked with equine herpes virus-1 (EHV-1) and tested for EHV-1 using a duplex real-time PCR assay. Any samples that failed the EHV-1 quality control were re-extracted. In order to monitor quality of specimen collection, specimens were tested for human endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3) using a duplex realtime PCR assay. In addition, the positive controls included in each PCR run were monitored for any shift in cycle threshold values to detect problems within individual runs.",

These results support the findings of a recent RCT reported by Cowling et al. 26 Cowling's study in Hong Kong concluded that non-influenza ARI may be detected at a higher rate in children for a short period after they received influenza vaccine. The noninfluenza virus incident rate ratio (IRR) was higher in the Hong Kong study (4\u00c14 versus 1\u00c16), but there are some key differences to our study, including age of subjects, follow-up period, proportion of illnesses swabbed and proportion of swabs yielding viruses. As with all observational studies, bias must be considered. Vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in Sydney were demographically similar (Table 1) ; however, lack of blinding by vaccination status makes it difficult to rule out selection or measurement bias. We could find no evidence of different parental responses to ILIs in vaccinated and unvaccinated children: parents of vaccinated children were no more likely to seek medical care during an ILI. However, we did find that health-seeking behaviours, recorded on enrolment (before the ILI observation period), such as hospitalisation (any cause), hearing tests and grommet insertion were significantly more common in the vaccinated groups, suggesting that families that vaccinate children have a prior preference for greater healthcare service usage. This may be a partial explanation for the observed difference in ILI frequency between the groups; however, prior access to any of these healthcare services did not predict the frequency of reported ILI.",

A formal biological explanation is lacking. A recent US observational (case-control) study has not found an association between influenza vaccination and detection of non-influenza respiratory viruses 27 . Re-analysis of observational studies or preferably new RCTs with high parentcollected specimen availability is required to further examine this phenomenon. It should be a priority to determine whether a causal association exists, whether it is consistent across vaccines and populations and whether any observed increase in the rate of non-influenza respiratory virus identification outweighs the benefit of seasonal TIVs in children.",
