Gold-based medicines were being used in China and the Middle East as far back as 3500 years ago and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2) was used as a diuretic during the Renaissance period, for example [2, 3] . More recently in the early twentieth century Paul Ehrlich, who coined the term \"chemotherapy\", developed Salvarsan, an arsenical, as a drug for the treatment of syphilis [4] . Contemporary medicinal inorganic chemistry though is a relatively young but vibrant research discipline. There are many excellent examples of metal-based therapeutics and diagnostics, metal chelators and inhibitors of OPEN ACCESS metalloproteins in the clinic, for example Figure 1 , or in development and our knowledge of the roles of metal ions in biological systems is continuing to expand [3, 5] .

Careful selection of metals and manipulation of geometries, coordination numbers and redox states by selection of appropriate ligands can lead to the regulation of electronic, chemical and photophysical properties. Individual ligands also contribute greatly to structural diversity and modulate stability, ligand exchange kinetics and second coordination sphere interactions. In turn the prediction and control of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of compounds together with the developments in relation to metallomics provide the opportunity to develop metal-based drugs with bespoke mechanisms of action [3, 5] .",

            "text": "Bismuth, thought to derive from the German word \"wismuth\" (white mass) is a relatively rare element and is the least abundant of the pnictogens or group 15 elements. In 1753 Claude Francois Geoffroy demonstrated bismuth to be a distinct element, as opposed to being elemental tin or lead. It is primarily found as bismuthinite (bismuth sulfide) and bismite (bismuth oxide) ores and sourced as a by-product of lead, copper and tin mining. It is naturally monoisotopic ( 209 Bi) and can be considered to be the heaviest stable element, given its theoretical half-life is 1.9 \u00d7 10 9 years [11] . Radioactive bismuth-212 ( 212 Bi) and bismuth-213 ( 213 Bi) in contrast have half-lives of 60.6 and 45.6 min respectively, and may have important roles to play as radiometals in radiopharmaceuticals [3, 12] . The metallic character of the group 15 elements increases down the group and Bi is considered metallic (or semi-metallic), as opposed to arsenic and antimony which are considered to be metalloids and nitrogen and phosphorous to be non-metals. The chemistry of arsenic, antimony and Bi is certainly less understood than that of nitrogen and phosphorous. Bi has a ground state electronic configuration of [Xe]4f 14 5d 10 6s 2 6p 3 and trivalent and pentavalent Bi, Bi(III) and Bi(V), respectively, are the two predominant oxidation states. In general the three 6p electrons are involved in bond formation and in the majority of compounds Bi is in the +3 oxidation state. Such compounds possess a so-called inert 6s 2 pair of electrons, which can have a stereochemical effect. These two 6s electrons can be involved in bonding though and many examples of organobismuth(V) compounds are known [13] . BiF5 is the only Bi(V) halide known. Given Bi(V) is a very strong oxidant in aqueous solutions (Bi V /Bi III E 0 = 2.03 V) it is noteworthy that Bi(V) is generally not stable in biological solutions [14] .",

This interaction though is likely to be non-covalent interchelative [22] . Bi(III) as mentioned has an affinity for thiolate ligands and thiolation of Bi(III) is thought to be the major biochemical fate of Bi(III) in cells and biological fluids [14, 24] . Bi(III) readily binds to the cysteine thiolate groups of amino acids and peptides for example. The crystal structure of Bi(Cys)3 was solved by X-ray crystallography demonstrating that Bi(III) can bind three cysteine thiolate groups and at physiological pH ( Figure 2b ). The average Bi-S bond length is ca. 2.54 \u00c5 [23] . Furthermore Bi(III) has been demonstrated to bind to glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide antioxidant, which is found at high concentrations in animal cells (ca. 5 mM). ESI-MS data indicates that Bi(III) and GSH bind at ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 [25] . A previous study by Sadler et al. had shown that the deprotonated thiol groups of GSH were the strongest binding site for Bi(III) and Bi(GSH)3 is stable over a pH range of 2-10. A formation constant for Bi(GSH)3 of log K = 29.6 was determined, using 1 H-NMR upon titration of GSH with [Bi(Hedta)]. Bi(GSH)3 is therefore more stable than Bi(III) complexes with edta (log K = 27.8) or citrate (log K = 13.5) for example [24] . Significantly spin-echo 1 H-NMR experiments demonstrated that RBC reacts with GSH in red blood cells both in vivo and in vitro [24] . There are numerous studies of Bi(III) binding to longer peptide sequences [26] [27] [28] .",

Similarly CBS also presents challenges in regards to its structural characterization. Many different bismuth citrate complexes have been isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Given that speciation of Bi(III) citrate complexes is pH dependent, Jin et al. solved the structure of CBS in dilute HCl (pH = 3) using X-ray crystallography. Crystals of K(NH4)[Bi2(cit)2(H2O)2].4H2O revealed the presence of three types of Bi dinuclear units [Bi(cit)2Bi] 2\u2212 , which assemble into a 3-D polymer, Figure 6b ,c [62] . It was proposed that CBS may rearrange from colloidal particles such as [Bi6O4(cit)4] 6\u2212 and [Bi12O8(cit)8] 12\u2212 at neutral pH to 3-D polymers and sheets at low pH and the polymeric structure described may represent the protective \"coating\" found on ulcer craters post treatment [62] .

HspA for instance is a molecular chaperone and assists with protein folding processes within the bacterial cell. It was also proposed to be involved in nickel homeostasis in H. pylori due to the presence of a nickel binding domain, a His and Cys rich C terminus, and the dependence of urease activation on the HspA gene. Bi(III) has also been reported to binds to apo-HspA with higher affinity than nickel(II) and induce structural reorganisation of the protein [64] . More recently it was proposed that irreversible binding of Bi(III) to an apical domain on HspA consisting of His45, Cys51 and Cys53 residues could interfere with zinc(II) ion delivery functions associated with HspA [69] .",

            "text": "Additionally, CBS has also been shown to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in H. pylori. ADH can produce acetaldehyde which forms adducts with phospholipids and exogenous proteins thereby damaging gastric cells and causing mucosal damage. Jin et al. suggest that inhibition of ADH is due to direct interference at the zinc binding sites through interaction with thiol groups [65] [66] [67] [68] . Bi is also known to interact with/inhibit fumarase [70] translational factor Ef-Tu [71] phospholipase A [72] and pepsin [73] . Though the exact mechanism of action of the anti-bacterial activity associated with Bi has yet to be elucidated, the majority of available evidence points towards Bi interacting with cysteine residues on key proteins or Bi interference at thiol-containing metal binding sites in various target proteins in H. pylori. The precise mechanism by which Bi-based compounds heal ulcers is also not understood. Wagstaff proposed that CBS facilitates healing of the lesion by: (i) forming a Bi-glycoprotein complex in vitro, which acts as a protective coating and a barrier to HCl diffusion in the ulcer crater; (ii) stimulating prostaglandin E2 production with consequent secretion of alkali into the mucus layer; (iii) exhibiting an anti-bacterial effect against H. pylori as previously discussed [74] . The anti-ulcer effects of CBS may well be more complicated than straightforward precipitation at the ulcer crater though given it is known that even though CBS forms an insoluble precipitate at acidic pH, Bi is taken up by gastric and intestinal mucosal tissue and Bi is capable of interacting with numerous cellular proteins [14] . Further studies are undoubtedly required.",

Reaction of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (H3Ssal, Figure 7a ) with BiPh3 gave the heteroleptic carboxylate-sulfonate complexes [PhBi(HSal)H2O]\u221e and [PhBi(HSal)EtOH]\u221e where 5-sulfosalicylic acid is doubly deprotonated. Reaction of 5-sulfosalicylic acid with Bi(OAc)3 gave the homoleptic complex, {[Bi(HSal)(H2Sal)(H2O)3]2.2H2O}\u221e, where 5-sulfosalicylic acid is found to be both singly and doubly deprotonated [75] . The molecular structure of [PhBi(HSal)H2O]\u221e is shown in Figure 7b . The Bi centre is six-coordinate and the geometry is pentagonal pyramidal. The sterochemically active lone pair is trans to the phenyl group found at the apical position. The ethanol complex, [PhBi(HSal)EtOH]\u221e, was determined to be insoluble in aqueous solution whereas the two remaining complexes were remarkably water soluble resulting in solutions of pH 1.5. It is reported that the development of Bi complexes which are not water soluble at low pH is desirable given the links between potentially toxicity, absorption and water solubility. At pH 2 BSS, CBS and RBC are insoluble in aqueous solutions for example. Nonetheless all three complexes had reported MIC values of <6.25 \u00b5g/mL against three laboratory strains of H. pylori (B128, 251 and 26695). Such activities compare favourably with those of BSS (\u226412.5 \u00b5g/mL) and 5-sulfosalicylic acid (>25 \u00b5g/mL) [75] .",

Initially three bisphenyl Bi sulfonates were synthesized and characterised, [Ph2Bi(O3SR)]\u221e where R is p-tolyl, mesityl or S-(+)-10-camphoryl ( Figure 7c ). These complexes were all insoluble in water and aqueous HCl solutions. The molecular structure of [Ph2Bi(O3S-Cam)]\u221e is shown in Figure 7d . It consists of polymeric helical chain structure of four coordinate Bi atoms, which bridge two sulfonate O atoms. The geometry is distorted trigonal bipyramidal. These complexes were found to rearrange in solutions of acetone or dmso though to give for example mono-phenyl Bi bis-sulfonates, Bi tris-sulfonates or BiPh3. Regardless the presence of the single sulfonato ligands in [Ph2Bi(O3SR)]\u221e produced a noteworthy increase in the anti-bacterial activity of the complexes, which had MIC values of \u22656.25 \u00b5g/mL as compared to BiPh3 (>64 \u00b5g/mL) and the inactive sulfonic acids. 6 ].

Novel Bi(III) complexes of fluoroquinolones, a family of broad spectrum antibiotics, which also possess good anti-H. pylori activity, were developed by Shaikh and co-workers [83] . The complexes were characterised by molar absorptivity determination, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Karl-Fischer aquametry, elemental analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The proposed structure of the Bi(III) norfloxacin complex is shown in Figure 9a as a representative example. All of the complexes developed exhibited better activity than their respective fluoroquinolone ligands against 16 clinically isolated strains of H. pylori. Significantly the complexes were also found to be active against some of the fluoroquinolone resistant strains investigated with MIC values of 1-4 mg/L (1-4 \u00b5g/mL). Two publications from China report on Bi(III) complexes of a glycosaminoglycan [84] and polysaccharides [85] . Hyaluronic acid (HA, Figure 9b ), is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan, which consists of repeating disaccharide units of N-glucosamine and D-glucoronic acid. It is highly negatively charged under physiological conditions and interacts readily with cations and has been demonstrated to bind to Cu(II), Ag(I), Au(III) and Fe(III) for example. Bi(III) complexes of high (1240 kDa), medium (675 kDa) and low molecular weight HA (240 kDa) were synthesized and characterised by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR and CD spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. It was proposed that Bi(III) binds to the hydroxyl, carboxylate and amino groups of HA. All Bi(III) HA complexes regardless of molecular weight exhibited similar activity as CBS (MIC = 5 \u00b5g/mL) against three strains of H. pylori (NCTC11637, 26695 and J99).",

Perhaps we should encourage/ challenge our colleagues in micro/molecular biology to take a more active interest in elucidating the mechanisms of action of Bi-based H. pylori drugs. In summary, eradication of H. pylori is an important goal for the global scientific community given its association with dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.

It is also noteworthy that: (i) pretreatment of BSS with albumin decreased the rate of binding and killing of E. coli; (ii) the activity of BSS against E. coli was much more rapid at pH 3 as opposed to pH 7; (iii) salicylates also possess anti-bacterial activity and therefore may also contribute to the activity of BSS [14, 89] .",

In addition it has been previously demonstrated that the anti-microbial activity of thiosemicarbazones can be enhanced on coordination to Sn, Cu and Ga [90] . Lessa et al. reported a family of Bi(III) thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes as potential anti-bacterial agents. The complexes developed exhibited good anti-bacterial activity, where both the mono-and bis(thiosemicarbazone) Bi(III) complexes were better anti-bacterial agents than their corresponding free ligands (Figure 10a The MIC for tetracycline hydrochloride against S. aureus was found to be 0.3 \u00b5M though. Only one of the complexes tested, [Bi(2Fo4Ph)Cl2], exhibited enhanced activity as compared to its free ligand against the Gram-negative bacteria, P. aeruginosa. Lessa et al. proposed that an increase in solubility and bioavailability of Bi on coordination was key to the observed activity [90] . There are a number of additional reports in relation to novel bismuth thisosemicarbazone complexes, which were investigated not only as anti-bacterial agents but also anti-cancer agents [19, [91] [92] [93] [94] . These complexes feature in Section 5, where only their anti-cancer activity is discussed.",

            "text": "A report also from the same group in Belo Horizonte, Brazil discussed the development of a series of Bi(III) complexes of 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone) derivatives ( Figure 10d) and their anti-microbial activity against S. aureus, E. facecalis, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. Hydrazone derivatives are known to possess anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activities [95] , though in this study the ligands investigated were found to be inactive against the panel of microorganisms investigated. In contrast and in general upon coordination to Bi(III) the anti-microbial activity of the hydrazone derivatives was enhanced against the Gram-positive bacteria though less notably against the Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa). Significantly the Bi(III) complexes were more active than their Sb(III) analogues and the Bi(III) hydrazone complex, [Bi(HAcpNO2Ph)Cl2], where H2AcpNO2Ph is 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(para-nitrobenzoylhydrazone), was found to be more active than tetracycline against S. aureus [95] . The X-ray crystal structure of [Bi(HAcpNO2Ph)(dmso)Cl] (Figure 10e) , was solved on recrystallization of [Bi(HAcpNO2Ph)Cl2]. from acetone/dmso, again highlighting Bi(III) affinity for dmso. The anti-fungal activity of the Bi(III) complexes against C. albicans were also better than their Sb(III) analogues. The Bi(III) hydrazone complex, [Bi(HAcPh)Cl2], where H2AcPh is 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone), (MIC: 44 \u00b5M) exhibited better activity than fluconazole (MIC: 59 \u00b5M), a well-known anti-fungal agent [95] . Bi-based ciprofloxacin compounds were developed by Turel and co-workers [96, 97] . Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic and development of Bi-based ciprofloxacin compounds was therefore an interesting strategy for the targeting of anti-microbial resisitance [96, 97] . Two Bi(III) ciprofloxacin (cf) compounds were reported; (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6]\u00b72H2O and (cfH2)2[Bi2Cl10]\u00b72H2O (cf = 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid) [96, 97] . No bonding between the quinolone and Bi(III) was observed though as the quinolones are either singly protonated (cfH) at piperazine N or doubly protonated (cfH2) at the carbonyl O and piperazine N. In were also demonstrated to have similar activity as cf.HCl against S. viridians, Enterococcus sp. and S. haemolyticus G, which are resistant to ciprofloxacin. The authors appropriately discuss the potential impact on speciation of dissolving their compounds in DMSO and increasing the pH on diluting the compound with media and serum for example. BiCl3 for example is known to form BiOCl readily in aqueous solutions and Bi(III) dimethyl sulfoxide complexes will also potentially form when Bi(III) complexes are dissolved in dmso as evidenced by the structure in Figure 10c ,e [95] .",

They initially identified a family of halobismuthanes derived from diphenyl sulfone as exhibiting promising anti-fungal activity against S. cerevisiae. Interestingly the X-ray crystal structure of the chlorobismuthane (Figure 11a ), reveals the asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules with different coordination geometries at the Bi centre: (i) five coordinate Bi centre geometry through intramolecular Bi-O and intermolecular Bi-Cl interactions and (ii) seven coordinate Bi centre through intramolecular and intermolecular coordinated Bi-O bonds, which is an unusual geometry for organobismuth(III) compounds. Inhibitory effects were linked with the Lewis acidity of the Bi(III) centre which was proposed to be the active site [100] . Subsequent investigations of the effect of introducing substitutents onto the diphenyl sulfone scaffold and replacement of the chloro group attached to the Bi centre, were undertaken [98, 99] . The findings suggest that in general there is an inverse relationship between lipophilicity of this family of compounds and anti-fungal activity; the higher the lipophilicity (ClogP values) the lower the activity of the halobismuthanes. Nonetheless a series of organobismuth(III) carboxylates, e.g., Figure 11b , display similar activity to chlorobismuthane (Figure 11a ) even though they have higher ClogP values. Organobismuth(III) dithiocarbamate analogues, Figure 11c , were inactive, which was attributed to the lowered Lewis acidity due to the lower electronegativity of the sulphur atom bound to bismuth and also the high ClogP values associated with these compounds [98] .

It is widely accepted that the pentavalent Sb(V) is reduced to Sb(III) in the macrophages and parasitic cells by different thiols including cysteine, cysteine glycine and trypanothione [63, 110] . Proposed biomolecular targets include the trypanothione synthase and reductase system. Trypanothione is a form of gluthatione, specific to the parasite in question. Trypanothione synthase, (TS), conjugates glutathione and spermidine to form trypanothione (N1-N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), while trypanothione reductase (TR), keeps the molecule in its reduced form. The TS and TR systems are essential for survival of the parasites and the Typanosomatidae family as they rely on it to replace the redox functions of systems such as the glutathione reductase system present in other organisms. Crystal structures revealed the Sb binding site in TR and thus provided the molecular basis for antimonial inhibition of TR. Upon reduction of TR by NADPH, a disulphide bridge associated with two cysteine residues (Cys52 and Cys57) separates to form two thiolate groups, just 4.4 \u00c5 apart. The Sb(III) ion is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry by the two aforementioned cysteinate sulphurs, one threonine (Thr335) and one histidine (His461) from a second TR that forms a dimer complex. Comparison of the reduced TR Sb(III) NADPH complex structure with trypanothione bound TR from L. cruzi shows that Sb(III) is binding at the catalytic site of the enzyme (Figure 12c ). Sb(III) therefore works by preventing interaction between the two sulphur atoms of the cysteine residues with His461, which acts as a proton exchanger in the reduction mechanism associated with glutathione reductase [111] . Ultimately the parasite's ability to buffer oxidative stress is thought to be decreased [112] .",

They showed that Sb(III) can compete with zinc(II) for binding motifs found in Leishmanial parasites and proposed that this competitive binding may be responsible for the pharmacological activity of Sb drugs [113] . Resistance to Sb(V) first line drugs, as well as other contributing factors such as harsh dosage regimens and cardio-and hepato-toxicity have driven research to find novel drug compounds which could be used to treat leishmaniasis [82] . Given Bi close proximity in the periodic table and similar biological chemistry to Sb there is potential for Bi drugs to have similar biomolecular targets. Therefore Bi could be an ideal candidate for the development of novel metal-based drugs in this field. There are only a few, nevertheless important, examples of Bi-based compounds, which have been developed and evaluated as potential anti-leishmanial drugs [82, 110, 114, 115] .",

The activity of four NSAIDs, naproxen (Figure 13a ) mefenamic acid, ketoprofen and diflunisal and their corresponding homoleptic tris-carboxylato Bi(III) complexes, of general formula [BiL3]n and which were previously investigated for anti-H. pylori activity [77] , were investigated against Leishmaniasis major promastigotes and human primary fibroblast cells for 48 h. Both groups showed activity only at the highest concentration tested (500 \u00b5g/mL) against L. major parasites, which is considered too high to be of practical use. A significant difference in the activity of naproxen and its tris-carboxylato Bi(III) complex was observed though, supporting a potential anti-leishmanial role for Bi. The Bi complexes were also more toxic towards human fibroblasts than the free acid also indicating that bismuth has a role in human cell toxicity [110] . , possessed the lowest IC50 of 1.9 \u00b5g/mL. Its structure was solved by X-ray crystallography (Figure 13e ). It is six-coordinate with distorted pentagonal pyramidal geometry. The stereochemically active lone pair is found trans to the phenyl group found at the apical position. When tested for potential human toxicity, against the fibroblast cell line, the Bi complexes in general were significantly more toxic than both the free substituted benzoic acids and the previously discussed Bi NSAID complexes. Andrews and co-workers recently reported a series of Bi(III) \u03b2-thioxoketonate complexes as anti-leishmanial agents. They hypothesised that Bi complexes with a more thermodynamically stable Bi-S bond would be less labile than for example a carboxylate analogue and in turn possess improved hydrolytic stability which should positively influence purity, reproducibility and activity in biological systems [82] . Though transition metal and p-block metal, including Bi, \u03b2-thioxoketonate complexes have been reported, the biological chemistry of the ligands or complexes were not explored [82] .",

The \u03b2-thioxoketones were selectively toxic to L. major promastigotes as opposed to the primary human fibroblasts. L1 (Figure 13a) , for example had similar activity as the antibiotic, Amphotericin B, with ca. 80% parasite kill at 25 \u00b5M (6 \u00b5g/mL). In contrast and surprisingly the Bi(III) thioxoketonates were in general less toxic than their free ligands. The L5 Bi complex, [Bi{C5H4NC(=O)CHC(=S)C6H5}3]. (B5) was the most active of the series with ca. 80% parasite kill at 50 \u00b5M (46 \u00b5g/mL). Though B5 was less toxic to the fibroblasts compared against the L. major promastigotes, in general the Bi complexes displayed little or no selectivity, which would suggest that they are not suitable candidates for the treatment of Leishmaniasis. Lipophilicity, stability and low lability were highlighted as factors that may be important in determining cellular uptake and interactions with biomolecular targets.",

In 2012 they reported Sb(III) and Bi(III) complexes of dipyrido[3,2a:2',3'-c]phenazine (dppz), [Sb(dppz)Cl3] and [Bi(dppz)Cl3] (Figure 15a ) which were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography (Sb complex only). These complexes, along with the free ligand dppz were tested against wild type (WT) and Sb resistant (SbR) strains of Leishmania infantum chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis, which are associated with visceral and cutaneous Leishmaniasis respectively. Dppz showed intrinsic activity against both the WT and SbR strains investigated with IC50 varying from ca. 0.8 to 2 \u03bcM. As expected the Sb(III) and Bi(III) complexes showed a higher activity against the same strains (ca. 0.6-1 \u03bcM), indicating a role for the Sb(III) and Bi(III) in the activity of the complexes. Interestingly the Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds, which had very similar activity, were at least 77 and 2400 times more active than tartar emetic against the WT and SbR strains respectively. Both complexes are 80 times more active than the trivalent BiCl3 and SbCl3 compounds than the WT strains also. This was interesting to note as this suggests that the metal alone is not sufficient to have anti leishmaniasis activity but perhaps as proposed improves the activity of dppz through complexation [115] .",

The molecular geometry of this 9-coordinate complex, accounting for the inert electron pair (6s 2 ), is one dodecahedral. The neutral thiosemicarbazone coordinates the Bi(III) via its pyridine nitrogen, imine nitrogen and thione sulphur to give two five-membered chelate rings, Figure 16b . This complex exhibits good cytotoxicity (IC50 <10 \u00b5M) against a panel of cancer cell lines; K562, (leukaemia), HCT116 (colorectal), HepG2 (hepatocellular) and HeLa (cervical) cancer cells. Significantly and in contrast to the 2-acetylpyrazine N(4)-phenylthiosemicarbazone complex exhibits similar cytotoxicity (1.8 \u00b5M) as cisplatin (1.2 \u00b5M) and superior cytotoxicity than the free ligand (>100 \u00b5M) and Bi(NO3)3 (41.2 \u00b5M) against the K562 leukaemia cells. Results from annexin-V FITC/PI double staining and caspase-3 activation experiments on HepG2 cells treated with this complex, suggest that the cytotoxicity observed may be due to induction of apoptosis [91] . [19] . The Bi(III) centre is nine-coordinate where the neutral pentadentate thiosemicarbazone ligand coordinates via three nitrogens and two sulphur atoms (N3S2) and two nitrate ions coordinate via the four oxygen atoms as shown in the X-ray crystal structure (Figure 17b) .",

There has been considerable interest in the development of Bi(III) thiosemicarbazone complexes as both potential anti-cancer and anti-bacterial agents, which has resulted in the development of interesting complexes with some good activity. Nonetheless the strategy of coordinating Bi(III) to thiosemicarbazones to enhance the activity of the ligands clearly does not always work [92] . Therefore the development of (Figure 18b ) was found to be the most cytotoxic of the compounds studied and 14-fold more cytotoxic than the free thiocarbonohydrazone ligand against HepG2 liver cancer cells [94] . The authors preliminary investigation into a possible mechanism of action of these complexes suggest that the apoptosis observed is connected with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and also reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential [94] .",

Such properties are attributed to reactive oxygen species generation and/or DNA interchelation [117] . The dinuclear Bi(V) complex, (Lp)2(Ph3Bi)2O, where the Bi atoms are bridged by one O atom, Figure 19a , was found to have a favourable IC50 value (1.8 \u00b5M) as compared to cisplatin (1.0 \u00b5M) against K562 cells. Significantly this Bi(V) complex was also more cytotoxic than the free ligand (ca. 5-fold), a reported Sb(V) lapochol complex, (Lp)(Ph3Sb)OH (c. 20-fold) and Ph3BiCl2 (c. 17-fold) and determined to be stable in aqueous solution [117] . This is a rare example of an organobismuth(V) complex that exhibits noteworthy in vitro cytotoxicity. (Figure 19c ) [118] . Sulfapyridine is a sulfonamide anti-bacterial, the first synthetic antibiotics to be administered clinically. It is no longer used medicinally in humans in part due to resistance but also a potential risk of developing agranulocytosis or leukopenia. Nonetheless the Bi(III) complex of sulfapyridine was demonstrated to inhibit the growth of leukemia cells, K562, with an IC50 of 44 \u00b5M at 72 h treatment. Sulfapyridine in contrast had an IC50 > 100 \u00b5M against the same cell line [118] .",

Norfloxacin as previously mentioned is a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibiotic. The BiPh3/NF polymer is predominantly a bridging structure about the Bi and IR spectroscopy indicates the formation of Bi-O and Bi-N bonds. The reported chain length is 2100. The Bi polymer exhibited superior activity than the antimony and arsenic-base polymers in four (pancreatic, breast, colon and prostate) out of the six cancer cell lines tested with marked activity against the pancreatic cell line, PANC-1 (EC50 = 14 \u00b5g/mL) which was also superior to that of cisplatin (EC50 = 340 \u00b5g/mL). The Bi polymer also exhibits selectivity when its cytotoxicity for the breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-231 (EC50 = 0.61 \u00b5g/mL) is compared to its toxicity towards the WI-38 normal embryonic human lung fibroblast cells (EC50 = 4.2 \u00b5g/mL).

An antimouse CD138 antibody was radiolabelled with 213 Bi where the antibody was modified with the 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-cyclohexyl-DTPA chelator. CD138 antigen was targeted as it is strongly expressed on myeloma cells in all patients.

Furthermore only moderate and transient toxicity was associated with treatment [131] . . It is noteworthy that potential advantages of PRRT using small peptides over RIT is lack of immunogenicity, fast diffusion and fast blood clearance, which can complement 213 Bi half-life of 45.6 min [129] . The peptides are analogues of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and target the GRP receptor, which is expressed on all invasive prostatic carcinomas but not benign prostatic tissue at high density.

Bi has been linked with the alleviation of side effects associated with cisplatin treatment for example [133] [134] [135] . Nephrotoxicity is a significant dose-limiting factor in cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Administration of Bi(III) salts prior to cisplatin treatment has been shown to depress the renal toxicity associated with cisplatin treatment. This renoprotective effect is thought to be due to Bi increasing metallothionein production in the kidneys [24, [133] [134] [135] . More recently, Leussink differentially expressed genes in treated and untreated NRK-52E cells. Down regulated (0.17-0.31-times) genes include cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, BAR (an apoptosis regulator), heat-shock protein 70-like protein, and ribosomal proteins S7 and L17, and S1, proteins belonging to the translation machinery. The single gene to be identified as being upregulated was glutathione S-transferase subunit 3A [136] .",

Hydrazone derivatives are known to possess anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activities [95]. The Bi(III) hydrazone complex, [Bi(HAcPh)Cl2] (Figure 19b) where H2AcPh is 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone), proved to be most active against a panel of cancer cell lines (Jurkat, HL60, MCF-7 and HCT-116). This compound was more cytotoxic than the free ligand, corresponding Sb(III) complex, [Sb(HAcPh)Cl2] and also cisplatin. The reported Bi(III) complex of the corresponding p-choro-benzoylhydrazone derivative, [Bi(HAcpClPh)Cl2], perhaps represented the best drug candidate though as it possessed a superior therapeutic index once activities against the normal cell line, PBMC, were considered [95]. Subsequently Marzano and co-workers developed a novel bismuth complex of sulfapyridine (SpyH), [BiCl3(Spy)3]",
