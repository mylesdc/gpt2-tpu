Induction was significantly greater (47-fold) in PIN1 shRNA cells. COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production increased 3-fold in KD MAEC, but did not increase in Control cells. The additional increase in COX-2 protein due to PIN1 depletion was post-transcriptional, as induction of COX-2 mRNA by LPS/IFN was the same in cells containing or lacking PIN1. Instead, the loss of COX-2 protein, after treatment with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, was reduced in cells lacking PIN1 in comparison with Control cells, indicating that degradation of the enzyme was reduced. zVF and PD150606 each enhanced the induction of COX-2 by LPS/IFN. zVF also slowed the loss of COX-2 after treatment with cycloheximide, and COX-2 was degraded by exogenous \u03bc-calpain in vitro. In contrast to iNOS, physical interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected, suggesting that effects of PIN1 on calpain, rather than COX-2 itself, affect COX-2 degradation. While cathepsin activity was unaltered, depletion of PIN1 reduced calpain activity by 55% in comparison with Control shRNA cells.",

PIN1 is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that contains an amino-terminal domain, the tryptophan-tryptophan (WW) domain, which is characterized by two tryptophan residues separated by 22 amino acids that can bind to phosphorylated serine-or threonine-proline sequences in substrate proteins. PIN1 also isomerizes this motif with its carboxy-terminal catalytic domain [1] . Isomerization of the phosphorylated serine-or threonineproline motif has a significant effect on conformation of many phospho-proteins. The conformational switching catalyzed by PIN1 allows it to regulate transcription factors, mRNA stabilization factors, and the susceptibility of a growing list of proteins to post-translational modifications and proteases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "Given the effect of calpain inhibitors on COX-2, calpain and cathepsin activities were measured. LPS/IFN increased calpain activity 6.0-fold in KD cells, and 5. Here, suppression of PIN1 in endothelial cells increased the induction of COX-2, and COX-2-dependent production of prostaglandin E2 by LPS/IFN (figures 1 and 2). Despite a nearly 5-fold greater induction of COX-2 protein in KD compared with Control MAEC, there was no difference in the induction of COX-2 mRNA ( figure 3 ). This suggests that PIN1 regulates COX-2 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Consistent with a post-transcriptional effect, PIN1 depletion reduced the turnover of COX-2 ( figure 6 ). Since COX-2 has a relatively short halflife, inhibition of turnover could lead to large, cumulative, post-transcriptional increases after induction with LPS/ IFN [8] .",

Here, the calpain inhibitor, zVF, increased the induction of COX-2 (figure 4) and reduced its degradation (figure 6), without increasing its mRNA (figure 5). As for E-64d, zVF can also inhibit cathepsin activity at concentrations similar to those that inhibit calpain [29, 37, 38] . Therefore, PD 150606, which is more selective for calpain compared with cathepsin [30] , was Effect of PIN1 knockdown on COX-2 mRNA Figure 3 Effect of PIN1 knockdown on COX-2 mRNA. A, KD and Control (Con) shRNA MAEC were treated with LPS and IFN for 0-8 h. B, Cells were treated with medium or LPS and IFN for 24 h. mRNAs encoding COX-2 and \u03b2-actin were determined by RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Representative ethidium bromide-stained gels are shown. Replicate COX-2 or \u03b2-actin products in a single gel were imaged for analysis. Bars represent mean + S.E. ratio of COX-2: \u03b2-actin products from densitometric analysis of images from 3 independent cultures. *:p < 0.05 for comparison with cells treated for 0 h in A, or with medium in B. In support of this idea, it was shown here for the first time that PIN1 depletion reduced calpain activity in endothelial cells. In contrast, cathepsin activity was not affected by PIN1 depletion ( figure 8 ). This result, combined with the effects of zVF and PD150606 on COX-2 induction and turnover, suggests again that calpain limits the expression of COX-2 in MAEC. Indeed, COX-2 was degraded by \u03bccalpain in vitro, indicating that it is a potential substrate in cells ( figure 7) . The reduced calpain activity in KD extracts (figure 8) could be due to an increase in expression or function of calpastatin or other unrecognized endogenous calpain inhibitors in KD cells, or to a reduction in expression or function of calpains [39] . Nevertheless, the results suggest that PIN1 depletion reduces calpain activity, consequently reducing the turnover of COX-2 in MAEC. zVF further reduced the loss of COX-2 in cycloheximidetreated KD cells ( figure 6 ). This may be due to the partial 55% reduction of calpain activity in KD MAEC (figure 8). The partially reduced calpain activity could account for the intermediate loss of COX-2 in the cycloheximidetreated KD cells, allowing zVF to further suppress turnover. It may also explain the ability of calpain inhibitors to increase induction of COX-2 in both KD and Control MAEC ( figure 4) . The partial reduction of calpain activity may be due to the incomplete (85%) suppression of PIN1 by the shRNA [6] . PIN1 may also function as a modulator of calpain activity and not as an absolute requirement.",

This suggested that PIN1 depletion might alter the susceptibility of its targets to digestion by calpain. For example, PIN1 could associate with these substrates and catalyze proline isomerization, affecting protease sensitivity. In contrast to iNOS, however, interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected here. A role for direct interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 cannot be completely excluded, however, since association of the proline isomerase with its putative substrate may be weak or transient. PIN1 could also affect association of COX-2, or iNOS, with other proteins that may indirectly regulate proteolysis. Thus, effects of PIN1 on calpain activity and/ or COX-2, or associated factors, could affect the sensitivity of COX-2 to digestion with calpain.",
