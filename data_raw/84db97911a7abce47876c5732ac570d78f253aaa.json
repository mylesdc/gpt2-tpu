            "text": "The lack of highly trained field epidemiologists in the public health system in Ghana has been known since the 1970s when the Planning Unit was established in the Ghana Ministry of Health. When the Public Health School was started in 1994, the decision was taken to develop a 1 academic-year general MPH course. The persisting need for well-trained epidemiologists to support the public health surveillance, outbreak investigation and response system made the development of the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP) a national priority. The School of Public health and the Ministry of Health therefore requested the technical and financial assistance of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in organizing the Programme. The collaboration started by organizing short courses in disease outbreak investigations and response for serving Ghana Health Service staff. The success of the short courses led to development of the FELTP. By October 2007, the new FELTP curriculum for the award of a Masters of Philosophy in Applied Epidemiology and Disease Control was approved by the Academic Board of the University of Ghana and the programme started that academic year. Since then five cohorts of 37 residents have been enrolled in the two tracks of the programme. They consist of 12 physicians, 12 veterinarians and 13 laboratory scientists. The first two cohorts of 13 residents have graduated. The third cohort of seven has submitted dissertations and is awaiting the results. The fourth cohort has started the second year of field placement while the fifth cohort has just started the first semester. The field activities of the graduates have included disease outbreak investigations and response, evaluation of disease surveillance systems at the national level and analysis of datasets on diseases at the regional level. The residents have made a total of 25 oral presentations and 39 poster presentations at various regional and global scientific conferences. The Ghana FELTP (GFELTP) has promoted the introduction of the One Health concept into FELTP. It hosted the first USAID-supported workshop in West Africa to further integrate and strengthen collaboration of the animal and human health sectors in the FETP model. GFELTP has also taken the lead in hosting the first AFENET Center for Training in Public Health Leadership and Management, through which the short course on Management for Improving Public Health Interventions was developed for AFENET member countries. The GFELTP pre-tested the Integrated Avian Influenza Outbreak and Pandemic Influenza course in preparation for introducing the materials into the curriculum of other FELTP in the network. The leadership positions to which the graduates of the program have been appointed in the human and animal Public Health Services, improvement in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and response along with the testimony of the health authorities about their appreciation of the outputs of the graduates at various fora, is a strong indication that the GFELTP is meeting its objectives.",

            "text": "Graduates of the SPH were found to meet the expectations of the Ministry of Health, as they took up leadership roles at district level. It was however, realized that a cadre of highly-trained epidemiologists with competencies and skills in applied epidemiology and disease control was needed to manage the existing complex of public health emergencies and emerging and re-emerging diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) and Avian influenza. During the early stages of implementation of the Global Programme for the Control of Malaria, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, the lack of highly trained field epidemiologists became more apparent as the demand for expert management, interpretation and use of disease surveillance data increased. Unfortunately, the MPH Programme did not make provisions for the training of this cadre of professionals. A process was initiated to establish a Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) to address the identified need. The Ghana FELTP (GFELTP) evolved from an initial collaboration with the United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through cooperative agreements with the SPH. Activities supported by this cooperation included organization of short courses on disease surveillance, outbreak investigations and response. More than 60 serving district health staff (frontline health workers) and MPH graduates benefited from these short courses over a three-year (2003) (2004) (2005) period [2] . Parts of the short course materials were later incorporated into the MPH curriculum of the School of Public Health. When, in 2005, the decision was taken to start an FELTP, the task of designing the curriculum was spearheaded by the faculty under the guidance of staff of CDC including staff from the Sustainable Management Systems Development Program (SMDP) [3] .",

In the second semester, residents take courses in each of the prescribed track (i.e., epidemiology for medical and veterinary professionals or laboratory for laboratory scientists) and some selected electives to make up for the required 36 credits for the course work. In addition, residents are required to be involved in 16 weeks of field activities made up of 8 weeks at the end of the first semester to undertake evaluation of surveillance systems of selected diseases and 8 weeks at the end of the second semester for analysis of available large datasets on diseases at national or regional levels. In the second year, residents develop their research topics under the guidance of their academic supervisors and mentors. A further requirement is the organization of at least one seminar prior to going for the field work. Ten months of the second year are devoted to field practice and collection of data while providing services to the district/region of assignment. The last two months are used for data analysis and write up of theses. During the 2-year period of training especially when on field postings, residents of the programme join the staff of the Ghana Health Service and Veterinary Service Directorate to investigate and respond to disease outbreaks and public health emergencies. Being mid-career professionals in public service, the residents sometimes lead these investigations, conduct public health interventions and present written and verbal reports to stakeholders with support of their supervisors and mentors.",

Needs assessment tools were developed and discussed by DSD and SPH at an orientation before the exercise commenced. The reports from these assessments were compiled into a composite document for implementation of sensitization workshops for the districts. The workshop had 19 participants, made up of Disease Control Officers, Nurses, Statistician, Midwives, and Medical Superintendent at the Volta River Authority (VRA) Hospital, Medical Assistant and District Director of Health Services. The general objective of the workshop was to give health workers in the district the appropriate knowledge and skills in identifying cases of priority diseases and also process the data and use it for public health action. In addition, core stakeholders such as district assembly members, immigration and custom officers, teachers, information officers, the police and the media were also involved.",

The investigation of an outbreak of herpes B virus infection in May 2011 in Techiman and adjoining districts of central Ghana reported this virus as the probable cause of zoonotic encephalitis in Ghana for the first time.The large number of disease outbreak investigations and the timely response that residents of the programme have been able to carry out alongside other Ghana Health Service or Veterinary Service staff to date have appreciably enhanced disease surveillance and response capacity in the country. In particular, the role that GFELTP team of physicians, veterinarians and laboratory scientists played in the investigation and response to the AI outbreak in Ghana in 2007, the multiple outbreaks of rabies in 2009 -2011, and the monkey-associated herpes-B encephalitis outbreak in 2011 demonstrated the great value of the One Health concept and the multi-disciplinary team approach which the GFELTP has adopted.",

Out of the 22 participants, 19 were Ghanaians, 1Kenyan, 1 Tanzanian and 1 Ugandan. All 19 Ghanaian participants were staff from the Ghana Health Service. The course was divided into four modules. These four modules were designed to touch on all aspects of health management. Uniqueness of the course was that during the four-week period, participants presented project proposals on management of public health interventions at the beginning of the course. They were helped to develop the proposals and implement them over the subsequent three months after the course. All participants were visited by a facilitator once during the three months of implementation. The Ghanaian participants came back for a day to present the results of what they implemented before receiving their certificates. The regional participants were visited by the coordinator and the AFENET focal person for the course in their various countries.

The MPH program which is the flagship program of the School is thriving well with enrolment from Ghana, the African Region and beyond.

The contribution of the FELTP to the strengthening of the epidemiology curriculum of the MPH program in the SPH has been acknowledged by both graduates and the Ministry of Health at several of the School's annual dissemination forum.

The emphasis on scientific writing and communication has also reflected in the oral and poster presentations that residents from the program have made in Regional and Global Scientific Conferences. The graduates of the program have all returned to positions with an evolving career structure that is likely to motivate them to remain in the public health service. As part of the new public health institute model facilitated by the international association of public health institutes (IANPHI) initiative in Ghana, the Ghana Health Service is developing a core public health technical or expert team career path that uses the GFELTP graduates to fill the critical role of epidemiologists at the subnational and national levels as well as along specific disease control or public health program lines. Crossover to public health administration track at the top of the path is an option and defined promotion track in keeping with the national public health service policy has been proposed. There is ample evidence of improved public health surveillance and response as well as evidence-based decision making taking place in the National Health Service following the joint evaluation of surveillance systems, disease dataset analyses, outbreak investigations, public health interventions with more regular reports, information sharing and periodic stakeholders' public health seminars at all levels. There has been a definite strengthening of the public health workforce and increased networking between programs in Ghana and with other countries [5] . The prospect of increasing support from the local stakeholders should see increasing enrolment in the program as demonstrated by the 2011 enrollment of nine service professionals, the highest number so far of the five cohorts. This should hasten the attainment of the vision and mission of the program.",
