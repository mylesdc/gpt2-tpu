This is the first report of a mesonivirus in Australia, which extends the geographical range of this virus family to 3 continents. The virus was isolated in 2010 from Coquillettidia xanthogaster mosquitoes during surveillance in the suburbs of Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. Cryo-electron microscopy of the CASV virions revealed spherical particles of 65 nm in size with large club-shaped projections of approximately 15 nm in length. The new virus was most closely related to Alphamesonivirus 1, the only currently recognized species in the family. In 2013 a further 5 putative new mesonivirus species were described: Hana, M\u00e9no, Ns\u00e9, Moumo and Dak Nong viruses. The evolutionary distance between CASV and two of its closest relatives, Cavally and Hana viruses (Jones-Taylor-Thornton distance of 0.151 and 0.224, respectively), along with its isolation from a different genus of mosquitoes captured on a separate continent indicate that CASV is a new species.",

The latter currently has one member species which was first described in 2009 [1] and later characterized in more detail in isolates from mosquitoes trapped on two continents. Cavally virus (CavV) was obtained from the Cote d'Ivoire region of West Africa from several mosquito species predominantly from the genus Culex [2] , whilst Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) was isolated from Culex vishnui and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes from northern and central Vietnam [3] . These viruses are the first members of the order known to infect insects [2, 3] . Both viruses were sufficiently similar to allow their classification as a single species, Alphamesonivirus 1 [4] . Membership of the family is likely set to expand due to the recent isolation of a number of viruses sufficiently different to justify the inclusion of additional species [5, 6] .",

Translation of ORF1a generates polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and expression of ORF1b, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other replicase-related domains, is regulated by a putative ribosomal frameshift (RFS) motif with sequence GGAUUUU [2, 3] , which results in read-through of the ribosome translating ORF1a and production of the polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab). Individual functional proteins are processed from the polyproteins by the viral protease 3CL pro and a putative host-cell protease(s) [6] . Translation of the ORFs further downstream is from subgenomic mRNA transcripts. Mesoniviruses replicate in Aedes albopictus (C6/36) insect cells and induce varying degrees of cytopathic effect (CPE) depending on the virus [2, 6, 7] . There is a large variation in the reported particle size of 60-80 [3] , 80 [5, 7] or 120 nm [2, 6] and in the appearance of the surface projections. While the projections of CavV and others isolated from Cote d'Ivoire have large club-shaped projections of approximately 12 nm, electron microscopy analysis of NDiV from culture supernatant revealed short spikes of only 3-4 nm [7] .",

They are descended from the ancestral group that acquired a 39-to-59 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN) which improved replication fidelity sufficiently to enable the evolutionary leap to the largest known RNA genome size of the coronaviruses. Genome structure for this order of viruses can roughly be divided into ORF1a, ORF1b and the 39ORFs which each encode for separate functional domains leading to suggestions of a genomic division of labor [8] . The expansion in genome size was not uniform and occurred in waves with increasing genome size: first ORF1b, then ORF1a and, finally, the 39ORF region [8] . As the number of new member species of mesoniviruses increases, further light should be shed on the biochemical and genetic processes which enabled this expansion.",

Cryo electron tomography of purified virions revealed that the particles were approximately 65 nm in diameter, with a smooth lipid bilayer and the presence of spike projections with a globular head attached to the virion by a low density stalk. Furthermore, treatment of the virions with a non-ionic detergent showed that the virus did not possess an internal core. Partial sequencing of the replication domains in ORF1a and ORF1b revealed a close relationship with alphamesonivirus 1, but the virus is sufficiently different to justify its classification as a new species of mesonivirus.",

Firstly, virus was purified from tissue culture supernatant by performing a clarifying centrifugation step (2,0006g; 10 min; room temperature) followed by filtration through a 0.22 mm filter. Free nucleic acids were digested by enzymatic treatment using RQ1 DNase (1 U/ml) and RNase ONE (2 U/ml) at 37uC for 30 min. Virus particles were sedimented using ultra-centrifugation (100,000 g; SwTi55 rotor; 2 h; 4uC) and resuspended in sterile PBS overnight on ice. Nucleic acids were extracted using a Qiaamp Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's recommendations with the modification that the carrier RNA was omitted from the AVL buffer. The RNA (5 ml of extract) was used as template in a reverse transcription using a primer containing a random hexamer attached to an arbitrary sequence (C-6N 59-GAGAAACCCAC-CACCAGANNNNNN-39). This was followed by second strand DNA synthesis using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq ",

Of 94 pools of mosquitoes, which consisted of mosquitoes from five different genera [17] , only one homogenate of pooled Coquillettidia xanthogaster female mosquitoes (n = 43) caused severe destruction of the cell monolayer when inoculated onto C6/36 cells. Sequencing of a 1200 bp PCR product obtained using random RT-PCR on extracted RNA, revealed that the virus was a mesonivirus (closest match using 843 bp input was Dak Nong virus (E value 9e-156); 77% identity with 89% query coverage) after comparing the sequence with the Genbank database using the BLASTn algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genbank). This virus was tentatively named Casuarina virus (CASV) after the suburb of Darwin (capital of the Northern Territory) within which the mosquitoes were trapped. This was the first isolation of a mesonivirus from Coquillettidia spp. mosquitoes and its identification in Australian mosquito populations reveals widespread distribution of the Mesoniviridae family.",

Images of 133 viruses were selected and the average diameter was determined to be 65 nm, in contrast to the 84 nm determined by uranyl acetate staining (Fig. S1 ). The difference in size determined by each of the protocols might be attributable to a flattening of the virus particles onto the grid during negative staining, thus giving the appearance of a larger virion diameter. Such differences in virion size have been observed by others previously when comparing images obtained following negative staining and freeze drying [19] . Again, protrusions were evident on some, but not all of the virions. In contrast to CavV and Ns\u00e9V, the protrusions of CASV did not appear as numerous or ordered, which may be unique to this virus, but might also be attributed to differences in staining or time of virus culture harvesting.",

Tomographic analysis revealed spike-like projections on the surface of some of the virions with a characteristic globular head attached to the virion surface through a low density stalk ( Fig. 2D ; Movie S1). The spikes were approximately 15 nm in length which was comparable to the well-characterized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S proteins of 17 nm and 19 nm respectively [20] . The discrepancy of these observations compared to the previous estimations of 3-4 nm [7] for other mesonivirus spike length was most likely due to the use of alternative imaging methodologies and could be resolved by further investigations of other mesoniviruses using cryo-TEM which is more likely to preserve the native virion structure. Some members of the order Nidovirales, such as transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, contain a core shell comprising membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that encases the viral RNA [21] . Whether mesoniviruses have a core has not been previously determined. To disrupt the viral envelope and enable visualization of the particle's internal structure, purified CASV virions were treated with the non-ionic detergent NP-40. No proteinaceous structure was visible by electron microscopy following treatment (Fig. 3) . Hence, CASV does not have an internal core.",

However, the inability of all mesoniviruses tested to date to replicate in vertebrate cells suggests that a vertebrate cryptic host is unlikely [5, 6] . Permissiveness for CASV to replicate in a range of insect and vertebrate cells was assessed by regularly monitoring inoculated cell monolayers for evidence of CPE and by assaying the cell monolayers and cell culture supernatant for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR. The ability of each of the cell lines to support the replication of other positive sense single stranded RNA viruses was also confirmed by the inoculation and subsequent RT-PCR detection of WNV RNA. While destruction of C6/36 cell monolayers by CASV was clearly evident by 2-3 days postinfection, there was no evidence of growth observed visually or by RT-PCR in any of the vertebrate cells tested, including an avian cell line (Table 1 ). In support of these data, IFA analysis of CASVinoculated Vero and C6/36 cell monolayers with a cocktail of two monoclonal that are specific for dsRNA (O'Brien, Hobson-Peters, Hall et al., unpublished), showed that while there was distinct perinuclear staining in the CASV-inoculated C6/36 cells, consistent with the detection of dsRNA replication intermediates [22] , there was no detectable replication of CASV in the Vero cells (Fig. S2A) .",

A similar trend was also seen for WNV (10 5.65 TCID 50 units/mL for Chao Ball; 10 8.22 TCID 50 units/mL for C6/36). The surprising differences between the ability of CASV to replicate in two insect cell lines is consistent with observations by Kuwata et al., (2013) whereby significantly lower levels of replication of DKNV in the Culex tritaeniorhynchus cell line compared with that achieved in the C6/36 cell line were noted [5] . Differences in the growth of these mesoniviruses in Culex cells compared to C6/36 cells might be attributable to the defective innate immune response of the latter [23, 24] . C6/36 cells lack Dicer-2 activity -an important enzyme in the insect cell antiviral response [23] . Lack of this antiviral defense mechanism likely enhances the permissiveness of these cells to replication of some viruses. Inoculation of other Aedes albopictus cells such as RML12 or RNAi-competent U4.4 would be useful to clarify these observations [25] [26] [27] .",

Analysis of the sequence revealed a putative RFS motif that was just upstream of the border between ORF1a and ORF1b (GGAUUUU). In these two ORFs, CASV had identical domain content and order as other recently identified mesoniviruses. This included the putative viral 3C-like chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (HEL), exonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyl-transferase (NMT) and 29-O-methyltransferase (OMT) domains. These domains also had a high level of amino acid sequence identity to homologous regions of the mesoniviruses (Table 2) , particularly alphamesonivirus 1 with which it shared 93 and 94% identity in the RdRp and HEL domains, respectively. An amino acid identity of ,90% has been suggested as a possible value for demarcation of species in the mesoniviruses based on a similar value within the coronaviruses [6] . The other 4 replicase domains showed less than 90% amino acid identity; hence, on the basis of sequence similarity alone it was unclear whether the new virus was a new species. However, as the majority of replicase identity scores were less than 90%, and as the evolutionary distance between CASV and the other mesoniviruses was considerably different, CASV is clearly a new species in the genus Mesonivirus in the family Mesoniviridae.",

For the isolates CavV and NDiV, which constitute the species Alphamesonivirus 1, a value of 0.031 was obtained. This compares favourably with a value of 0.029 for the same regions calculated previously by Lauber et al. (2012) [4] . As expected, CASV was closest to alphamesonivirus 1, with distances of 0.147 and 0.151 separating it from NDiV and CavV, respectively. This was considerably larger than the minimum distance established for the demarcation of nidovirus species of 0.037 for this region [4] . Hence by this analysis, CASV is a new species in the family Mesoniviridae, and genus Mesonivirus. This analysis also confirmed that the newly identified HanaV, Ns\u00e9V, and M\u00e9no viruses are species of mesonivirus. From this analysis, Dak Nong virus (DKNV) should also be considered a new species in the genus. Unfortunately, insufficient sequence information was available for Moumo virus (MoumoV) to be able to determine its appropriate classification.",

Similar results were obtained using a neighbor joining model (data not shown).

Phylogenetic analysis of the CASV genome in combination with its isolation from a different genus of mosquitoes captured on a separate continent to previously described mesoniviruses, supports the classification of CASV as a new species in the Mesoniviridae family. The detection of mesoniviruses in the tropics of three different continents suggests that the viruses are geographically widespread. In agreement with this, we have also recently isolated new viruses with high sequence identity to NDiV from Culex annulirostris mosquitoes captured in Brisbane on the east coast of Australia (McLean, Hobson-Peters, Hall, van den Hurk et al., unpublished data). The relatively recent identification of this group of viruses is likely due to the lack of any disease association which meant there was previously little incentive to isolate these agents. Sequencing of more isolates will provide further insights into the evolutionary development of these recently classified viruses in addition to greater understanding of the mosquito virome.
