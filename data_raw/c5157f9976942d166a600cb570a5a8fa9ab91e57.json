Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv.1.Lu cells) are sensitive to CDV infection and are homologous to the natural host system of mink. The current study analyzed the response of Mv.1.Lu cells to CDV infection by iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS. In total, 151 and 369 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were markedly up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. Thirteen DEPs were validated via real-time RT-PCR or western blot analysis. Network and KEGG pathway analyses revealed several regulated proteins associated with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Further validation was performed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay, which demonstrated that different CDV strains induced NF-\u03baB P65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Moreover, the results provided interesting information that some identified DEPs possibly associated with the pathogenesis and the immune response upon CDV infection. This study is the first overview of the responses to CDV infection in Mv.1.Lu cells, and the findings will help to analyze further aspects of the molecular mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis and the immune responses upon CDV infection.",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV), a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Morbillivirus, family Paramyxoviridae, causes a severe highly contagious lethal disease in carnivores, such as dogs, lions, ferrets, raccoon dogs, foxes, and minks (Williams et al., 1988; Deem et al., 2000; Martella et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010; Viana et al., 2015) . The disease is distributed worldwide and is characterized by respiratory and gastrointestinal tract symptoms with generalized immunosuppression (Blancou, 2004; Decaro et al., 2004 ). The immune system dysfunction of CDV infection favors opportunistic secondary pathogens, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in a wide range of carnivore species (Appel et al., 1982; Kauffman et al., 1982; Blixenkrone-Moller, 1989) . Generally, in domestic dogs, CDV establishes a systemic infection, initiating transmission from immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages and/or dendritic cells, of the upper respiratory tract to the local lymphatic tissues by immune-mediated progression, and ultimately propagates to most organs and tissues, including epithelial tissues via cell-associated viremia (Appel et al., 1982) . Epithelial cells are susceptible to CDV infection and play a role in transmission during the late stages of CDV pathogenesis (Pratakpiriya et al., 2012; Noyce et al., 2013) . The virus is amplified and secreted from the epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary systems of the infected host (Ludlow et al., 2014) . The infection of various viruses has been demonstrated to interact widely with numerous host cell proteins. Some interactions elicit changes in the host proteome, as illustrated by the capacity of the virus to both induce and evade the host immune response (Kash et al., 2006) , effecting autophagy and apoptosis (Ludwig et al., 2006; Gunnage and Munz, 2009 ). For measles virus (MV), another morbillivirus closely similar to CDV, cell cycle arrest in lymphocytes (Naniche et al., 1999) and apoptosis in T lymphocytes (FugierVivier et al., 1997) have also been reported. Many studies have reported the effects of CDV infections on the host cell proteins, such as inhibiting STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear import (Rothlisberger et al., 2010) , inducing cytokine responses in PBMCs (Nielsen et al., 2009) , and inducing lymphocytes apoptosis (Kumagai et al., 2004) . However, most of these reports have primarily investigated a single host cell protein or partially selected proteins and the mechanisms of CDV pathogenesis and immunomodulation have not been fully elucidated. Thus, a new approach for further understanding the pathogenic mechanism and immunomodulation of CDV infection is needed, and the identification of global host cell proteins that interact with CDV infection represents one option. More details associated with host responses to CDV infection should also shed some light on potential targets for antiviral agents.",

The canine distemper virus strain CDV-PS (GenBank accession no. JN896331), a low passage isolate (<7 passages) from a morbid dog in 2013 (Yi et al., 2013) , was preserved in our laboratory. The virus was propagated in Vero cells. In the study, three additional passages of the virus were performed in Mv.1.Lu cells, resulting in the virus suspension with a titer of 10 3.1 TCID 50 /mL determined by a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay (Yamaguchi et al., 1988) . Briefly, monolayers of Mv.1.Lu cells in 96-well plates were infected with a 10-fold serial dilution of the supernatant fluids and further incubated for up to 120 h. The wells were assessed for cytopathic effects (CPE) after 3-5 days, and the TCID 50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula. Because of the low virus titer and the impurity of the virus suspension, virus concentration and purification were performed to improve the virus titer and avoid the effect of non-viral components. The clarified suspension was concentrated by polyethylene glycol 6,000 precipitation and purified by ultracentrifugation in a gradient of sucrose according to standard procedures. Sucrose-purified viruses were then titrated using the TCID 50 assay as described above, and the titer of the virus stocks increased to 10 6.9 TCID 50 /mL. The attenuated CDV vaccine CDV 3 strain was treated the same as PS. The virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until further use in the following experiments.",

Therefore, the degradation of I\u03baB proteins (typically represented by I\u03baB\u03b1) and phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of the NF-\u03baB proteins (typically represented by NF-\u03baB P65) are distinct features of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation. The network analysis of the DEPs involved in the immune response has preliminarily indicated the induction of the NF-\u03baB pathway by PS infection. To further validate this speculation, Mv.1.Lu cells were infected with PS at 2 MOI, after incubation for 12 or 24 h, total proteins were collected to measure the expression of I\u03baB-a and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB P65 proteins. As shown in Figure 6A , compared to that in mock-infected cells, phosphorylated NF-\u03baB P65 (P-P65) and I\u03baB-a proteins were obviously increased and decreased in PS-infected cells, respectively (the original blots are shown in Figure S2 ). To assess whether PS infection facilitates NF-\u03baB P65 nuclear translocation, Mv.1.Lu cells were infected with PS at an MOI of 2 or mock infected for 24 h. As shown in Figure 6B , NF-\u03baB P65 showed evident nuclear translocation in PS-infected cells but remained in the cytoplasm of mockinfected cells. Further, to determine whether other CDV strains could activate NF-\u03baB P65, the expression of phosphorylated p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 was also detected in CDV 3 -infected cells, which was increased and decreased, respectively ( Figure 6A ). Additionally, the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB P65 was also observed in CDV 3 -infected cells ( Figure 6B ).",

Notably, an interesting observation in the present study was that CDV infection induces NF-\u03baB activation in Mv.1.Lu cells. The NF-\u03baB pathway regulates the expression of numerous immune system components to efficiently modulate the innate immune, inflammatory, and antiviral responses (Bose et al., 2003; Bours, 2005) and comprises a hub of cellular signal transduction pathways involved in host immune responses to viral challenge (Moynagh, 2005) . So far, NF-\u03baB has been reported as activated following various viral infections of porcine parvovirus , type 2 porcine circovirus (Wei et al., 2008) , and herpes simplex type 1 (Patel et al., 1998) . Additionally, NF-kB activation has previously been shown in MV infection (Helin et al., 2001) and was postulated as one of the mechanisms by which CDV might induce osteoclastogenesis (Mee and Sharpe, 1993) . Moreover, NF-kB was subsequently demonstrated as induced by CDV (Onderstepoort strain) infection in human osteoclast precursors (Selby et al., 2006) ; however, these observations are all cases in humans or found in case of one single CDV strain. No reports of different CDV strains affecting NF-\u03baB signaling in mink cells have been previously demonstrated. In the present study, nine NF-\u03baB signaling regulators and downstream cytokines, including TNFa, IRAK4, TRAF6, TRAF2, NF\u03baB1, NF\u03baB2, RelA, TNFaIP3, and VCAM1, were significantly up-regulated, and the NF-\u03baB complex inhibitory protein I\u03baB-\u03b2 was obviously down-regulated. Further, KEGG pathway and network analyses of the DEPs involved in the immune response process also indicated the induction of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results preliminarily indicated the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by PS infection in Mv.1.Lu cells. More profound confirmation was observed by the detection of the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit and the proteasome degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein in PS-infected Mv.1.Lu cells. Moreover, the activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in CDV 3 -infected Mv.1.Lu cells also confirmed these findings. Together with the previous finding that NF-\u03baB activation was found in human cells after CDV (Onderstepoort strain) challenge, these findings enriched the current knowledge of NF-\u03baB activation by CDV infection, suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation was not specific for a certain CDV strain or a certain species cells, but was suitable at least in part for several CDV strains and different species cells. Further validation is needed to compare the ability of various CDV strains to activate NF-\u03baB signaling in other cell lines. In addition, some DEPs involved in the NF-\u03baB pathway, containing IRAK4, RelA, TRAF6, NF\u03baB1, and TNF-a together with IRAK2 and IL-6, were also identified as associated with measles and respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis and pertussis, which are similar to the respiratory symptoms of CDV infection. The causative agent of measles is MV. In dogs and ferrets, CDV causes a disease that is highly similar to measles in humans (Hutchins et al., 2004; Perry and Halsey, 2004) . Several theories have proposed that IL-6 is a critical inducer in the development of pagetic osteoclasts and bone lesions in Paget's disease induced by MV (Roodman et al., 1992; Ehrlich and Roodman, 2005) . Mice expressing IL-6 and TNF-a in astrocytes suffer ataxia, inflammation and neurodegeneration after MV infection (Akassoglou et al., 1997; Raber et al., 1997) . Therefore, the expression of these cytokines could contribute, in part, to mink pathological symptoms during CDV infection. Furthermore, in the present study, NLR signaling pathway was closely associated with PS infection. This innate immunity signaling pathway may play essential roles in the production of type I interferon and in promoting inflammasome assembly upon virus activation (Kobayashi et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2009) . Recent studies have suggested that the inflammasome NLRP3, known as the NOD-like-receptor-family, pyrin domaincontaining 3, recognizes several RNA viruses, such as influenza virus (Allen et al., 2009; Ichinohe et al., 2010) , VSV (Rajan et al., 2011) , and EMCV (Poeck et al., 2010) . MV also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the caspase-1-mediated maturation of IL-1\u03b2 (Zilliox et al., 2007; Komune et al., 2011) . The NF-\u03baB-induced activation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b2 gene expression is requisite for activating caspase-1 by the NLRP3 inflammasome to further regulate the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (Motta et al., 2015) . However, whether there is signaling crosstalk between NF-\u03baB activation and the NLR signaling pathway during CDV infection is an open question. Collectively, the findings suggested that activation of the innate immune NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and the NLR signaling pathway was involved in mink immune responses against CDV infection, and the NF-\u03baB signaling was associated with the pathological respiratory or other symptoms FIGURE 5 | Confirmation of the iTRAQ-MS data by western blotting or real-time RT-PCR. (A) Western blot analysis of NF-\u03baB1, RelA, MHC-I, RPS29, and NF\u03baBIB in PS-infected and control samples at 12 and 24 hpi. GAPDH was served as internal reference. (B) The intensity ratio of the corresponding bands (infection/mock) was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized against GAPDH. (C) Eight selected differently expression proteins related to NF-\u03baB pathway were testified using real-time RT-PCR method. Each gene was performed in three independent experiments. The relative gene expression was calculated using 2-CT model, representative of n-fold changes in comparison with mock-infected samples. Error bars represent the standard error for triplicate samples. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. The data was analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's test.",

The NHERF, Na + /H + exchanger regulatory factor, commonly locates or becomes enclosed in the intestinal brush border, thereby binding to the renal proximal tubule brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 protein, which is mainly responsible for the absorption of electroneutral salt in the intestine and is the most essential sodium absorptive transporter (Donowitz et al., 2005) . Therefore, NHERF plays a crucial part in establishing and maintaining the functional integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous reports have demonstrated that NHERF down-regulation leads to reduced Na + absorption though affecting NHE3 activity, ultimately increasing intestinal epithelial permeability and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Sartor, 2006; Strober et al., 2007) . Butler et al. discovered that the dysregulation of sodium transit contributed to piglet diarrhea and the pathogenicity of TGEV after infection (Butler et al., 1974) . In the present study, NHERF is significantly down-regulated, consistent with a previous observation of the significant downregulation of NHERF1 (a member of NHERF family) protein in Lu cells were infected with 2 MOI PS, CDV 3 or mock-infected. At 24 hpi, the cells were fixed and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to mink NF-\u03baB P65 and mouse monoclonal antibody specific to CDV N protein, then incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG and Cy3-labeled goat anti mouse IgG, respectively. Cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. The fluorescent images were analyzed under a confocal microscopy (Leica, Germany).",

            "text": "Ubiquitination, the covalent conjunction of ubiquitin to the target protein substrate, is the first of two successive steps associated with ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions, including the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling and type I IFN pathways (Ciechanover, 1994; Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002) . Accumulated evidence has suggested that various viruses have evolved complicated mechanisms to exploit or manipulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Gao and Luo, 2006) . For example, the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is required for influenza virus replication (Widjaja et al., 2010) and is also required other viruses, such as rotavirus (Lopez et al., 2011) , human cytomegalovirus (Tran et al., 2010) , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Zhou et al., 2014) . The present study identified TRAF2, TRAF6, UBE2L6 (E2 ubiquitin ISG15-conjugating enzyme), USP48 (an ISG15 specific isopeptidase enzyme) and TRIM33 (E3 ubiquitin-ligase) as up-regulated proteins involved in protein ubiquitination. TRAF2 and TRAF6 are well-recognized as signal transducers in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway that function together with a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex to catalyze the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and ultimately activate I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and the downstream NF-\u03baB pathway (Deng et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2016) . As an IFN-induced ubiquitin-like protein, ISG15 plays a role in immunomodulation and imparting a direct antiviral activity against a wide spectrum of virus (Pincetic et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2011; Sooryanarain et al., 2017) . Although the present study failed to detect the ISG15 protein, we identified the significantly up-regulated proteins UBE2L6 and USP48, which are strongly related to the ISGylation of ISG15. Similar to the mechanism of ubiquitination, ISGylation involves the sequential co-operation of E1, E2, E3 and an ISG15-specific isopeptidase enzyme (here identified as USP48) to facilitate ISG15 combination with target proteins for the execution of antiviral responses (Kroeker et al., 2013; Falvey et al., 2017) . The tripartite-motif family (TRIM) of proteins plays essential roles in the innate immune responses to antimicrobial infections. TRIM33, a member of the TRIM family and previously known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (TIF1-\u03b3), functions in monocyte/macrophage mediated inflammation (Gallouet et al., 2017) and inflammasome activation (Weng et al., 2014) . Our results provided the first evidence of multiple differentially up-regulated immune-related proteins associated with protein ubiquitination in response to PS infection in Mv.1.Lu cells, indicating that ubiquitination appeared to be a pivotal regulatory mechanism in the immune responses to CDV infection in mink.",

In the present study, seven up-regulated proteins, including TNF-a, RelA, NF\u03baB1, TRAF2, a-tubulin, CTSK (Cathepsin K), and CTSV (Cathepsin V), were identified as apoptosis-related, suggesting the induction of apoptosis in PS infection in Mv.1.Lu cells. CTSK and CTSV are associated with a mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathway to trigger the apoptosis of host cells, while TNF-a participates in an extrinsic receptor-mediated pathway (Benedict et al., 2002) . This finding was consistent with previous reports showing that CDV induces apoptosis in the cerebellum and lymphoid tissues of the natural infection of dogs and in Vero cells in vitro (Moro et al., 2003; Del Puerto et al., 2010 . The mechanisms of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CDV have not yet been clearly illuminated, and the extensive study of these proteins should enhance the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying apoptosis regulation during CDV infection.",
