But with the arrival of so many new players on the global health scene, and the subsequent fragmentation of global health governance, we surely need WHO more than ever [3] . It is the best placed of all health agencies to coordinate the disparate, often overlapping global health initiatives and to set global norms and standards in health care, and its convening power (its ability to bring together experts) is unparalleled. Two recent WHO initiatives on preparing for and responding to global public health threats show the organization at its best, although there are, as always, some important caveats.",

WHO's standard process for guideline development typically takes years of consultations and endless rounds of revisions, a process that is wholly inadequate for dealing with emergency health threats such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or H5N1 avian infl uenza. In response to requests for advice from frontline clinicians and public health professionals on how to treat H5N1 infections, WHO convened a new type of panel to issue rapid, evidencebased advice. It took one month to convene an expert team, and fi ve weeks for the team to summarize the evidence and prepare draft guidelines. The guidelines were then discussed at a two-day meeting, after which a draft manuscript for publication was prepared within 10 days.",

The process could be expedited, say the authors, by identifying or establishing collaborating centers skilled in producing evidence-based guidelines and by building in-house capacity to reduce the time needed to organize a review team. It will also be vital for this new rapid advice group to make its process of panel selection as transparent as possible if the group is to garner the trust of the public health community. WHO has previously come under fi re for allowing industry to unduly infl uence its expert committees, and for failing to ensure that committee members declare their competing interests [3] . The rapid advice group must not sacrifi ce transparency in the interests of urgency.",

These regulations are an international legal instrument designed to ensure maximum protection against the international spread of infectious disease while minimizing restrictions on travel and trade. Up until the 2005 revision, the regulations in force since 1969 (IHR 1969) required notifi cation of just three diseases: yellow fever, cholera, and plague. The instrument was therefore hopelessly outdated for dealing with the new infectious diseases that have emerged at a rate of about one per year over the last 20 years [6] , or indeed for dealing with established threats such as pandemic infl uenza. IHR 1969 had several other limitations-for example, surveillance relied totally upon individual governments notifying WHO and there were no specifi c strategies to help build the capacity of resource-poor countries to monitor or respond to outbreaks [7] . Compliance was poor, in part because countries feared that reporting of outbreaks would lead to unwarranted and damaging travel and trade restrictions [5] . China's initial reluctance to disclose the SARS pandemic was motivated by such fears [7] .",

The European Union, for example, already has its own network for reporting unusual events that may constitute a public health emergency [11] -does this network supersede the IHR 2005?
