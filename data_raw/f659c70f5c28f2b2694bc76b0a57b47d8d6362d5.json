While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling. These results demonstrate that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3.",

However, we have anecdotally observed that highly purified RNAs, including necrotic RNAs, are poor activators of TLR3 in cultured cells when compared to the synthetic dsRNA analog, poly(I:C). These observations suggest that intrinsic features within dsRNAs can influence signaling by TLR3. Also, component(s) in addition to the dsRNAs are needed to activate TLR3. The antimicrobial peptide LL37 and other peptides that can bind dsRNA were recently found to enhance the TLR3 response to poly(I:C) and viral dsRNAs [18] . Since viral RNAs exist as complexes with proteins, we wanted to determine whether viral proteins could act to modulate TLR3 signaling.",

The HCV-encoded polymerase, NS5B, is a validated drug target and has been extensively characterized [21] . As with polymerases in general, NS5B resembles a closed right hand that contains thumb, palm and finger subdomains [19] . In vitro, recombinant NS5B proteins can bind and initiate RNA synthesis by a de novo initiated mechanism or by extension from a template annealed to a primer [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . De novo initiated RNA synthesis uses a single-stranded (ss) RNA template and a purine nucleotide as the first nucleotide, while primer extension uses a partially duplexed RNA [28] . The de novo initiated versus primer-extended modes of RNA synthesis is regulated by a flexible loop named D1 that extends from the fingers subdomain to contact hydrophobic residues in the thumb subdomain [27] . The release of the D1 loop is needed to sterically accommodate the ternary complex during elongative synthesis. The polymerase from the 2a genotype of HCV exists in a structurally more closed conformation than that of the 1b polymerase in part due to a tighter contact between the D1 loop and the thumb subdomain [27, 29, 30] . This feature has been proposed to allow the 2a polymerase to be more efficient at RNA synthesis by the de novo initiated mechanism since it cannot initially accommodate a partially duplexed RNA.",

To document this observation, BEAS-2B cells that endogenously express TLR3, TLR4, and RIG-I were examined for their response to several dsRNAs. BEAS-2B cells have been used extensively to study the effects of viral infection and activation of innate immunity on cytokine production, including the production of Interleukin 6 (IL6) [40, 41, 42] . The dsRNAs tested include the Reovirus genomic RNA, the S4 dsRNA made by annealing in vitro transcribed positive-and negative-sense strands of the Reovirus S4 RNA, and the Bell pepper endornavirus dsRNA, BPEV, purified from bell pepper plants [43] , and other viral and synthetic dsRNAs. Transcripts of the JFH-1 genome were used as a ssRNA control. All the RNAs were added to the media of BEAS-2B cells and the amount of cytokine IL6 secreted into the medium quantified by ELISA (Fig. 1A) . At 20 h, IL6 levels induced by poly(I:C) (0.13 mg/ml) was at least six-fold higher than that of dsRNAs or ssRNA (0.3 mg/ ml; Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A ). The production of IL6 in response to poly(I:C) was rapid and could be observed within 2 h of poly(I:C) addition (Fig. S1B ). In contrast, cells treated with S4 dsRNA did not yield level of IL6 significantly above the background even after 20 h (Fig. S1B) .",

RIG-I is a suitable control in this experiment since it also recognizes dsRNA [46] . Only cells treated with siRNAs to TLR3 had reduced IL6 levels in the presence of BPEV dsRNA (Fig. 1C) . With poly(I:C)-induced cells, siRNAs to TLR3 also reduced IL6 production by 5163% (n = 4) (data not shown; [18] ). RT-PCR confirmed that the siRNAs did knock down TLR3 mRNA levels in both untreated and poly(I:C) treated cells (Fig. 1D) . ODN2006, which we previously shown to inhibit TLR3 signaling [47] reduced the IL6 levels in the presence of poly(I:C) to less than 20% of the control reaction (data not shown) while EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect on IL-6 production in the presence of poly(I:C) (data not shown). Thus, while the viral dsRNAs are poor TLR3 agonists, the low level of cytokine production by BEAS-2B cells was primarily due to the activation of TLR3. These results form the basis of the hypothesis to be tested in this work: the activation of TLR3 by viral dsRNA requires additional factors.",

Since RNAs in cells exist in complex with proteins, we postulate that viral RNA-binding proteins could also enhance the TLR3 response to the viral dsRNAs.

A comparison of viral dsRNAs and poly(I:C) for activation of TLR3. A) Effects of various potential TLR3 ligands on IL6 production by BEAS-2B cells. All of the RNAs were added to the culture media. Poly(I:C) (pIC) was added to 0.13 mg/ml and the other RNAs were added at 0.13 to 0.3 mg/ml. IL6 was quantified in an aliquot of clarified cell medium, and the total amount of IL6 was normalized to the total medium volume. The data shown is the mean 6 SEM, with the number of assays in parentheses: pIC (n = 23), Reovirus dsRNA (ReoV, n = 9), Reovirus S4 dsRNA (S4; n = 28), BPEV (n = 6), JFH1 (n = 3). B) A comparison of the effects of viral dsRNAs and poly(I:C) in HEK 293T cells transfected to express the WT TLR3 or a ligandbinding mutant, H539E. Activation of TLR3 was measured by the ratio of the firefly luciferase driven by an ISRE promoter element to a constitutivelyexpressed Renilla luciferase [47] . Each bar represents the mean value of three replicates, with the range for one standard error shown above the bars. C) TLR3 is required for the increase in IL6 production in response to BPEV dsRNA. BEAS2B cells were transfected with a control nonspecific siRNA (nsRNA), a set of three siRNAs to TLR3 (siTLR3), or a siRNA to RIG-I (siRIG-I), grown for 48 h before addition of BPEV dsRNA (0.3 mg/ml) to the culture media. D) RT-PCR results demonstrating that the siRNA targeting TLR3 decreased the abundance of the TLR3 message. BEAS2B cells were transfected with either control nonspecific siRNA or siRNAs to TLR3. After 48 h, cells were exposed to media alone (f) or to poly(I:C) at 0.13 mg/ml. RT-PCR was performed to determine fold induction of TLR3 mRNA above media 18 h later. Data is presented as a percent of the result from the nonspecific siRNA. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025837.g001 (2aD21), the truncated HBV CP (H-cp149), and the SARS-CoV Nsp15 ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). The Nsp15 used in this experiment is a catalytic-inactive version of an endoribonuclease that binds and preferentially cleaves ssRNAs [49] . Identical results were obtained with the WT Nsp15, hence the enzymatic activity of Nsp15 is not a factor in the response (data not shown). These results show that a subset of the RNA-binding proteins is more competent in enhancing TLR3 signaling. The activities of the HCV polymerases and the viral capsids will be analyzed in turn below.",

Moreover, ODN2006, an inhibitor of TLR3 signaling [47] reduced IL6 levels to 4067% of control while EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect, further suggesting that the enhancement of dsRNA induced signaling is dependent on TLR3 (data not shown).

Therefore, it is unlikely that RNA synthesis by 1bD21 is responsible for the induction of TLR3 signaling. However, to establish this directly, we tested a catalytic mutant named GDA wherein the divalent metal-binding motif required for polymerization was mutated. We also tested three additional mutants that are defective for de novo initiation, including a five-residue deletion of the D1 loop name m26-30 [26] . The locations of the key mutations in the 1b polymerase structure are shown in Fig. 3C . Since m26-30 has a major change in conformational to 1bD21, we tested it for the ability to bind a dsRNA of ca. 900 bp derived from Reovirus genome and found that retained the ability to bind dsRNA (Fig. 3D ). All of these mutant polymerases enhanced IL6 production over the level of poly(I:C) alone by at least two-fold ( Fig. 3E and Fig. S2B ). Figure 3 . The 1b HCV polymerase can enhance IL6 production by BEAS-2B cells. A) Enhanced IL6 production in the presence of 1bD21 can be knocked down by SiRNA to TLR3. siRNAs specific to TLR3 (siTLR3), RIG-I (siRIG-I), or a nonspecific control (nsRNA) were transfected into at a concentration of 30 nM into cells 48 h prior to the addition of 1bD21 (0.15 mM) and poly(I:C) (0.13 mg/ml) to the culture medium. IL6 in the medium was collected 24 h later and quantified by ELISA. The data from 3 to 4 sets of samples are presented as a percentage of the IL6 in the sample treated with nsRNA (100%). B) IL6 production by BEAS-2B cells in response to stimulation by the single-stranded polyinosinic acid (0.13 mg/ml), poly(I:C) (0.13 mg/ml) or lipolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/ml), the agonist for TLR4 in the absence (\u00d8) or presence of 1bD21 (0.15 mM). C) A model of the 1b HCV polymerase that illustrates the location of the D1 loop (in light blue), the GDD active site (in yellow), and the short helix deleted in mutant m26-30 (in red). D) The 1bD21 polymerase and 1b.m26-30 can form a complex with the double-stranded S4 RNA. The S4 dsRNA was labeled with a-32 P-CTP and used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The gel image shown is from a non-denaturing stacked polyacrylamide gel of 5 and 20%. E) Effects of mutations in 1bD21 on IL6 production induced by poly(I:C). f denotes a reaction with no added proteins. Proteins 1bD21, 1b.m26-30, and the active site mutant GDA were added to the culture media (final concentrations 0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 mM) in the absence or presence of 0.13 mg/ml poly(I:C). LL37 was added to a final concentration of 3 mM. F) The 1b HCV polymerase (1bD21, 0.1 mM), but not the 2a polymerase (2aD21, 0.1 mM), allowed TLR3 to produce cytokines in response to viral dsRNAs. In addition to poly(I:C), the RNA ligands used were those extracted from Reovirus virions (ReoV), from the endornavirus BPEV, and the annealed transcripts of the sense and antisense strands made from the S4 cDNA of Reovirus (S4), and the transcript of the HCV 2a JFH-1. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025837.g003",

In the absence of 1bD21, the single-stranded JFH-1 RNA and three different viral dsRNAs were poor inducers of IL6 production in BEAS2B cells when compared to poly(I:C). This result is consistent with our initial observation that TLR3 does not respond efficiently to viral RNAs ( Fig. 1A & 3F, Fig. S1A ). 1bD21 (0.1 mM) increased IL6 levels induced by the S4 dsRNA and the BPEV dsRNA by 4 to 6fold (Fig. 3F) . 1bD21 had only a modest increase when JFH-1 ssRNA was used as a ligand. In contrast, the activation of signaling was approximately 20-fold higher with dsRNA than with JFH-1 (Fig. 3F) . Consistent with our previous observation, 2aD21 (0.1 mM) was unable to enhance IL6 production when added to cells along with either the ssRNA or dsRNA (Fig. 3F ).",

In this assay, de novo initiated RNA synthesis was determined with template LE19P, whose 39 terminal puromycin prevents primer extension, while primer extension used template PE46, which contains a partially double-stranded hairpin structure that can be extended by the polymerase. The products of the two modes of RNA synthesis demonstrate whether a single or a partially duplexed RNAs are bound in the template channel of the polymerase [24] [25] [26] . Furthermore, products from the two templates are associated with two distinct polymerase conformations: a structurally closed conformation can initiate better by a de novo mechanism or a more open conformation that favors primer extension [26] . Notably, the crystal structure of 2aD21 has a more closed conformation than that of 1bD21 due to additional interactions between the D1 loop and the thumb subdomain of the polymerase [29] .",

The proteins were mixed together with a 1:1 molar ratio of SL26 then crosslinked with a Stratalinker prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The gel image on the left shows the fluorescently-labeled RNA shifted above the free SL26 at the bottom of the gel. The complexes that contain a monomer or a dimer of the HCV polymerase are labeled to the left of the gel image.

A protein with such a deletion named 2a.m26-30 was found to be debilitated in de novo initiated RNA synthesis while retaining the ability to extend from a primed template (Fig. 4A ). 2a.m26-31 also showed a distinct thermal denaturation profile compared to that of 2aD21, when analyzed by differential scanning fluorimetry, consistent with the two proteins having different conformation(s) (Fig. 4B) . Protein 2a.m26-30 added to BEAS-2B cells had no effect on IL6 production (Fig. 4C) . When added along with poly(I:C) to BEAS-2B cells, 2a.m26-30 dramatically enhanced IL6 production to levels comparable to reactions containing 1bD21 (Fig. 4C, n = 4) .

It is therefore likely that the altered interaction with RNA is responsible for the inability of H-cp149 to enhance TLR3 signaling when compared to the other capsid proteins. Again, to reduce the effects of nonspecific RNA binding inherent to many RNA-binding proteins, SL26 containing an 11-bp dsRNA was used to examine whether H-cp183 and H-cp149 are distinguishable in their ability to bind RNA. SL26 bound H-cp183 as well as B-cp, and the R-cp (indicated by shifts to higher molecular mass smears). However, no shift occurred with H-cp149 (Fig. 6C) .

In a companion manuscript [18] , we demonstrated that LL37 is a potent enhancer of dsRNA-dependent TLR3 signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that a subset of viral proteins can significantly enhance both poly(I:C) and viral dsRNA-induced TLR3 signaling. These viral proteins include polymerases from two genotypes of hepatitis C virus and three viral capsid proteins. Requirements for the polymerases and capsid proteins (1bD21, 2a.m26-30, B-cp, Rcp, and H-cp183) to activate TLR3 signaling were examined and a common property is the ability to bind dsRNAs. Two proteins (2aD21 and H-cp149) that bind dsRNA less well are also less effective in enhancing TLR3 signaling. These results suggest that features that affect dsRNA binding modulate the ability of proteins to activate TLR3 signaling. A second requirement elucidated with the 1b HCV polymerase and the RRV CP is the ability of the proteins to enter cells and co-localize with TLR3 in endosomes. The focus of the discussion below will be on the requirements for activating TLR3 signaling, with a final section on the conformation of the HCV polymerase.",

The difference between what makes poly(I:C) a good TLR3 agonist in the absence of RNA-binding proteins and what makes the viral dsRNAs inferior ones will require in-depth analysis. We believe that this work identifies conditions that will facilitate these efforts. Based on our current results, Reovirus S4 dsRNA made by in vitro transcription is as potent a TLR3 agonist as the genomic dsRNA extracted from Reovirus virions, suggesting that no obvious posttranscriptional modifications are required to activate TLR3 signaling. Another feature of poly(I:C) that may obviate the need for viral proteins or LL37 may be that the inosine-cytosine base pair has only two Hbonds. We observed that poly(A:U) is also an excellent agonist for TLR3 in the absence of LL37 and viral protein (Fig. S1A) . However, weaker base pairing alone is unlikely to provide the full explanation for poly(I:C) being such a potent agonist; poly(G:U), which also has two H-bonds per base pair, is a poor agonist for TLR3 signaling in the absence of viral dsRNA proteins (Fig. S1A) .",

The proteins can be produced in E. coli or extracted from virions (as in the case of BMV), suggesting that post-translational modifications are not required for the enhancement of the TLR3 response. Similarly, peptides such as LL37 that are potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling can be synthesized chemically without specific modifications [18] . In addition, both enzymes and structural proteins can be potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling as long as they interact with either dsRNA or partially duplexed RNAs. The SARS-CoV Nsp15 preferentially binds ssRNA and not dsRNA [49] , and could not efficiently enhance TLR3 signaling. A deletion that increased interaction between the 2a HCV polymerase and a partially duplexed RNA template made the polymerase a better enhancer for TLR3 signaling (Fig. 4C) . The second feature of the TLR3 enhancers is that they have the ability to form oligomers. This is intuitive with the viral capsid proteins, but viral RdRps have surfaces that mediate oligomerization that may facilitate RNA binding [56, 57, 58] . Indeed, oligomerization of the HCV polymerase can affect the mode of RNA synthesis [27] . LL37 also exists in higher order complexes in the absence of RNA and is required at micromolar concentrations in contrast to the viral proteins that are active in our assays at nanomolar concentrations. This is likely due to multiple LL37 molecules being needed to bind and/or coat the dsRNAs and mediate TLR3 activation [18] .",

However, the encapsidated viral RNAs are highly compacted and contain a high percentage of dsRNAs with non-Watson-Crick base pairing, close to 70% [59, 60] . This likely explains how the CP can bind the dsRNA needed to activate TLR3. The CP's of BMV and RRV are capable of binding to the double-stranded S4 RNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. S4C ). In the context of a viral infection, however, we note it is likely that fully assembled virions may not result in activation of TLR3 signaling if the dsRNAs are not exposed. We have added highly purified BMV virions and Reovirus virions to BEAS-2B cells and 293T cells expressing TLR3 and have not observed induction of cytokines or TLR3-specific reporters (Kao and Ranjith-Kumar unpublished results).",

Whether the dsRNA-binding proteins facilitate binding of the dsRNA by the TLR3 or the uptake of dsRNA to endosomes remain to be determined. However, it is known that TLR3 binds to linear dsRNA [61] . TLR3, unlike the RIG-I-Iike receptors [62] , lacks helicase activity to unravel the tertiary interactions that could stabilize the dsRNA. The dsRNA-binding proteins could disrupt the tertiary structure in the dsRNAs to facilitate recognition of the dsRNA by TLR3. Electron microscopy revealed that LL37 decreases the particle size of the primarily globular poly(I:C) and results in more filamentous structures [18] . With the second scenario, the dsRNA-binding proteins could facilitate entry of the viral dsRNAs into endosomes, perhaps by increasing the interaction with trafficking chaperones, such as scavenger receptors [51] , but these RNA-binding proteins likely need to complex and bring dsRNA to endosome in order for TLR3 activation to occur. The net effect is an increase in the concentration of ligand available to TLR3. Further studies will be required to unravel the complex requirements whereby the dsRNA-binding protein activate TLR3 signaling.",

            "text": "The results in this work are also informative for the function of the HCV polymerase. We note that the enhancement of TLR3 signaling by HCV polymerase is independent of RNA synthesis since the active site mutant is capable of enhancing TLR3 signaling (Fig. 3D ). All polymerases undergo structural transitions between open and closed conformations in response to the stages of nucleic acid synthesis. Indeed, the monomer of the HCV polymerase contains a template channel that can sterically accommodate ssRNA, but not dsRNA [26, 66] . During the formation of a nascent RNA from the template, however, the polymerase needs to release the interaction between the D1 loop and the thumb subdomain in order to accommodate the elongating nascent RNA-template RNA duplex. The 1bD21 can both extend from a primed template as well as initiate from the 39 terminus of a single-stranded RNA. We believe that this is a manifestation of the 1b polymerase existing in an equilibrium between the open and closed forms in vitro, likely accounting for better dsRNA-binding by the 1b polymerase and its enhanced ability for dsRNA-induced signaling by TLR3. In contrast, the 2a polymerase exists predominantly in a closed conformation and thus is less able to bind to dsRNA and enhance signaling by TLR3 [29] . Increasingly, the open and closed conformations of the HCV polymerases are being linked to polymerase function. For the 1b HCV polymerase, the open conformation also exposes a binding pocket for the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma and mediates the ubiquitinylation and degradation of retinoblastoma to increase cell cycle progression during HCV infection [67, 68] .",

Previous study by Naka et al [69] found that immortalized liver cells stably transfected with HCV NS5B and HEK 293 cells stably transfected with both NS5B and TLR3 genes show increased activation of TLR3-depedent IFNb signaling, although the activation in HEK 293 cells was only 2-fold. In a recent study from our laboratory, transient overexpression of NS5B and RIG-I resulted in 8 to 14-fold induction of IFNb promoter-driven luciferase activity in Huh7 and in HEK 293T cells while overexpression of NS5B and TLR3 had no effect, suggesting that expression of NS5B in these two cell lines predominantly activates cytoplasmic innate immunity receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 [70] . In both these studies, the NS5B polymerase was expressed from transfected plasmids and catalytic activity of the polymerase is required. In the present study, exogenously added HCV polymerase protein activates TLR3 without requiring RNA synthesis since polymerase mutated at the catalytic site still activates TLR3. In addition three viral capsid proteins as well as LL37 that bind RNA but do not have catalytic activity also activate TLR3 signaling. Addition of both dsRNA and the RNA-binding protein are required for this activation. RNAbinding protein alone has no effect since RNAs synthesized by the HCV polymerase in cells may not enter efficiently into acidic endosomes, the site of TLR3 signaling [15] . Thus the effect and mechanism of TLR3 activation by RNA-binding protein are likely different from that observed by Naka et al. [69] or Ranjith-Kumar et al. [70] .",
