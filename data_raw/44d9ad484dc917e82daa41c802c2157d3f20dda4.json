Currently, the two commercially available prophylactic vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, based upon virus-like particles (VLP) derived from the major capsid protein L1 effectively protect against infection by the two most common HPV types found in cervical cancer (for review see [1] ). The minor capsid antigen L2 also shows promise for preventive vaccination in animal models, although it is less immunogenic than L1 VLP. However, neither L1 VLP nor L2-based vaccines generate therapeutic effects against established HPV infection [2] . Therefore, given the significant burden of HPVassociated lesions worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic HPV vaccines for the control of existing HPV infection and associated malignancies.",

Furthermore, DNA vaccines are capable of sustained cellular gene expression, promote MHC class I antigen presentation, and have the capacity for repeated administration since they do not lead to the generation of neutralizing antibodies. However, an important limitation of DNA vaccines is limited potency since they lack the intrinsic ability to amplify and spread in vivo.

Although the fusion of E7 with CRT enables such DNA vaccines to elicit significant E7-specific CD8 T cell immunity in the absence of CD4 T cell help [12] , approaches to boost CD4 + T cell help are likely to enhance DNA vaccine potency. Indeed, CD4 + T cells play a significant role in priming effector CD8 + T cells, thus augmenting the CD8 + T cell responses, as well as generation of memory T cell populations (for review see [13] ). CD4 + T cells help to differentiate na\u00efve CD8 + T cells into effector cells by providing activation signals to dendritic cells (DCs), most notably IL-2, thus promoting CD8 + T cell proliferation. Thus, strategies to induce CD4 + T helper cells at sites of CD8 + T cell priming can potentially enhance CTL immune responses.",

Since papillomavirus L1 or L2 antigens likely contain CD4 + T cell epitopes [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , we reasoned that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus (BPV) L1 and L2 may provide CD4 + T cell help and enhance the antigenspecific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by DNA vaccines. An additional potential benefit would be the induction of neutralizing antibody and protective immunity [19, 20] . We showed that co-administration of vectors containing BPV L1 or L2 DNA in combination with DNA vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific CD8 + in both CRT/E7 and ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic systems. We also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors containing BPV1 L1 \u00b1 L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1/L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses as well as L1-specific neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that co-administration with BPV1 L1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. In addition, the observed enhancement of CD8 + T cell immune responses by DNA encoding L1 and L2 was also found to extend to HPV-16 L1/L2 system. Overall, our data suggest that co-administration of DNA encoding papillomavirus L1 or L2 can be used to enhance antigenspecific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination for the control of HPV infection and HPV-associated tumors. Furthermore, our approach can also generate neutralizing antibodies against papillomavirus for potential prevention against infection. This strategy also provides the opportunity to combine preventive and therapeutic approaches. Our strategy may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems for the control of infection and/or cancer.",

To further promote clinical translation, subsequent investigations focusing on directly characterizing the antitumor effects of co-administrating HPV16 L1 with CRT/E7, and whether reversing the sequence of HPV16 L1 abolishes the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response enhancement should be conducted. In addition, since our vaccination regimen achieved complete tumor suppression, the frequency of vaccination may be modified and further studied to determine the optimal vaccination regimen. Importantly, our data show that the current vaccination strategy can generate enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses by both intradermal and intramuscular vaccination. Since DNA vaccines are commonly applied intramuscularly in the clinic, future translation of the current vaccination technology may focus on the intramuscular route of administration.

Summary of the flow cytometry data Several strategies have been employed to induce CD4 + T helper cells to enhance antigen-specific CD8 + T cellmediated immune responses generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines. We have previously demonstrated that a DNA vaccine encoding invariant chain (Ii) with the class II-associated invariant peptide (CLIP) region replaced with the pan HLA-DR binding epitope (PADRE) could elicit potent PADRE-specific CD4 + T cell responses in vaccinated mice [24] . In addition, a coadministration of this DNA construct (Ii-PADRE) with DNA encoding HPV-16 E7 generated significantly greater CD8 + T cell immune responses relative to a coadministration of DNA encoding HPV-16 E7 with DNA encoding unmodified Ii [24] . Thus, the current study represents another promising approach to enhance CD4 + T help for the improvement of DNA vaccine potency, but with the added benefit of inducing prophylactic immunity too. It will be of interest in the future to perform a headto-head comparison between vectors containing BPV L1/ L2 DNA with Ii-PADRE DNA for their ability to enhance antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines. Such information will facilitate the selection of the most effective or desirable DNA construct for improving DNA vaccine potency.",

            "text": "Another potential mechanism for enhancing the therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine potency through the coadministration with L1/L2 DNA is the potential formation of VLPs in transfected cells. It has been shown that the expression of L1 can lead to the formation of VLPs in eukaryotic cells [25] . Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that papillomavirus VLPs can directly activate dendritic cells and thereby increase expression of costimulatory markers and MHC class I and II molecules [26] [27] [28] . Thus, the co-administration of L1 DNA may lead to the local activation of DCs, resulting in further enhancement of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by DNA vaccination. However, since the L2 only expression construct had a similar effect to L1 DNA, this suggests that the presence of VLP does not explain the enhanced CD8 T cell response upon coadministration with CRT-E7 or OVA constructs.",

Since all these strategies function via different mechanisms, the combination may potentially result in significantly enhanced antigen-specific immune responses and improved antitumor effects.
