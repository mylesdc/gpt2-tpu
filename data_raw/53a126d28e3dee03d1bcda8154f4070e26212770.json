In the field of medicine, usage of chitosan for the delivery of vaccine is favored by a wide range of researchers. However, due to its own natural limitations, its application has been constrained to the beginning of study. In order to improve the applicability for vaccine delivery, researchers have carried out various chemical modifications of chitosan. This review summarizes a variety of modification methods and applications of chitosan and its derivatives in the field of vaccine delivery.",

Vaccines can be further divided into four categories: (i) vaccines containing microorganisms that are artificially inactivated by chemicals or heating; (ii) vaccines containing microorganisms that have undergone attenuated culture or directly use relevant immunological substances; (iii) vaccines derived from inactivated toxic compounds, rather than microorganisms, which are referred to as toxoid-based vaccines; and (iv) subunit vaccines, which use a purified fragment of the pathogens that is able to create an immune response [13] . Moreover, a quantity of innovative bacterial vaccines is also in development and in use [13, 14] . Over the past two decades, promising DNA vaccine technology, offering simplicity of preparation, and rapid and relatively inexpensive mass production, has become an alternative to traditional vaccines, and has continued to evolve. DNA vaccines can be used to treat human and animal infections, cancer, allergies or autoimmune diseases [15] . The antigenic structure of DNA vaccines produced in vivo is similar to that produced by natural infection, and can induce highly specific humoral and cellular responses [16] .",

Human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection, the progression of which can be slowed down by antiretroviral therapy but cannot be eradicated, causes approximately one million deaths each year. Using successful vaccines can be more effective for controlling infection [18] . Not only infectious diseases, but more and more researchers try to use vaccines rather than chemical materials, radiation and surgery to fight cancers, and have made some breakthroughs. Matejic et al. [19] found through clinical trials that vaccinated glioblastoma patients exhibited significantly prolonged median survival than those who were not immune. In addition, fibrosarcoma is a locally aggressive malignant tumor. Generally, treating fibrosarcoma requires wide excisional surgery, although it is often difficult to remove enough by incision at the tumor infiltration site. Katsuro et al. [20] showed the utility of recombinant Newcastle disease virus as a candidate for tumor therapy, due to its specific immunity.",

Antigens play a role in triggering an adaptive immune response that activates the human immune response. Immunopotentiators act to enhance the immunogenicity and stability of antigens, promoting the synthesis and secretion of antibodies. Delivery systems, as an essential transport medium, make sure that the antigen is targeted to the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [21] . With the emergence of multiple types of vaccines, the delivery of vaccines also presents a variety of situations. Researchers are committed to designing multifarious targeted delivery systems for the purpose of making the best use of vaccines. For example, nanoparticles (NPs), which can serve as stabilizing vaccine antigens or vaccine adjuvants, such as virus-like particles, liposomes [22] , colloidal saponin containing micelles (ISCOMs), polymers and non-degradable nanospheres have been noted as delivery vectors for their ability to activate different elements of the immune system, as well as their good biocompatibility. Some of these NPs can enter APCs through different routes, thereby modulating the immune response to the antigen [23] . Additionally, nature also provides other substances as a gift of vaccine delivery. Chitosan, obtained by deacetylation of chitin, which is widely present in nature (Figure 1 ), is a slightly pearlescent and translucent flaky white solid. Its basic properties are: (1) chitosan is insoluble in water and alkaline solutions, and soluble in dilute acid, forming a sticky solution. However, in dilute acid, the 1, 4 glycosidic bond of chitosan hydrolyzes slowly, and results in a gradual decrease of the viscosity; (2) chitosan contains hydroxyl, amino and other polar groups, showing good hygroscopicity and moisture retention; (3) chitosan has been used as a drug carrier because it is degraded into a nontoxic substance by lysozyme, releasing the drug slowly, as well as having the property of forming a film; and (4) chitosan can adsorb proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids and other substances by complexation and ion exchange. It is worth nothing that chitosan and its derivatives have good biocompatibility and biodegradability. Not only do the degradation products have no toxic side effects or immunogenicity, and not accumulate, but they also have many unique properties, such as antibacterial, antimicrobial, disease resistance, anticancer, and wound healing. Therefore, it is applied broadly in the pharmaceutical industry compared to conventional excipients, due to these excellent properties. Moreover, the safety of chitosan, as well as its mucosal adsorption-promoting properties, allow it to be developed for vaccine delivery [24] . Over the years, more and more researchers have designed various vaccine delivery systems based on chitosan. They have improved the drawbacks of chitosan by modification to maximize its effects.",

Among them, Pluronic \u00ae block copolymer F127 (F127), also known as Poloxamer 408 (Figure 4) , a non-ionic hydrophilic triblock copolymer, has been used as a protein stabilizer and immunomodulator to improve the instabilities of vaccine proteins and increase their adjuvanticity [32] . In vitro experiment results demonstrated that Bordetella bronchiseptica Dermonecrotoxin (BBD)-loaded CMPs prepared in the presence of F127 showed significantly higher immune-stimulating activities than chitosan MPs, suggesting that the addition of F127 enhanced both the stability of the used vaccine and the uptake of BBD-loaded CMs in immune cells.

In addition, in vivo immunological study revealed that the adjuvant efficiency of HBsAg-loaded TMC NPs was highly stable for a long time, and was better than the control, suggesting that TMC NPs can be used widely for the treatment of various diseases with a controlled intranasal delivery. Lu et al. [35] investigated the effects of TMC MPs on drug release rate and transport across intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that the release of drug from drug-loaded TMC MPs did not interact with the intestinal epithelial cells, and did not affect the permeation of the released drug. Maaden et al.

Thus, polymers with mannosylation can efficiently bind to macrophages via specific interaction with mannose receptors, resulting in enhanced cellular uptake, further promoting antigen presentation and T cell activation. Currently, mannosylation has been widely applied for the modification of drugs and delivery systems to augment immunogenicity. Jiang et al. [41] prepared mannosylated chitosan microspheres (MCMs) (Figure 9 ) to encapsulate Bordetella bronchiseptica antigens containing dermonecrotoxin (BBD) for a vaccine delivery platform. The binding ability of BBD-MCMs with murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells), on which surface mannose receptors are overexpressed, was confirmed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. In vivo experiments revealed much higher BBD-specific IgA antibody responses induced by BBD-MCMs than that induced by BBD-loaded CMs both in saliva and serum (Figure 10 ), implying the significant impact of mannose moieties in enhancing immune-stimulating activities via a specific interaction between mannose groups and mannose receptors. Additionally, glucomannosylated chitosan nanoparticles (GMC-NPs) were developed to deliver tetanus toxoid (TT) using the tandem cross-linking method developed by Harde et al. [42] . The obtained GMC-NPs acted both as a vaccine carrier and immunopotentiator for TT. With the help of clathrin-and receptor-mediated endocytosis, higher intracellular uptake was realized by GMC-NPs in Raw 264.7 cells and Caco-2 cells. Compared with the controls, GMC-NPs elicited significantly higher mucosal, humoral and cellular immune response, which is difficult to achieve simultaneously with commercial TT vaccine. In addition, Yao et al. [43] utilized MC to condense anti-GRP DNA vaccine (pGRP). A subcutaneous prostate carcinoma model was established to evaluate in vivo efficacy. The results showed that the level of anti-GRP IgG in mice treated with MC/pGRP was significantly higher than that treated with C/pGRP NPs (p < 0.01). Moreover, the growth of tumor cells was suppressed via immunization with MC/pGRP NPs.

Generally, there are two kinds of method for screening peptide ligands: chemical synthesis and phage display. Yoo et al. [52] screened M cell-targeting nine-peptide ligands of CKSTHPLSC (CKS9) by the phage display technique, and confirmed the target specificity by an in vitro transcytosis assay and in vivo assay. The CKS9 was conjugated to water-soluble chitosan (Figure 11) , and CKS9-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles (CKS9-CNs) prepared by ionic gelation were accumulated into Peyer's patches regions in greater amounts than chitosan nanoparticles (Figure 12 ), which suggests that the CKS9-CNs are effective vaccine carriers. They also conjugated CKS9 with chitosan to coat porous PLGA microparticles to deliver Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (BmpB) as a swine dysentery vaccine, and the porous surface and internal morphologies of BmpB-PLGA and BmpB-WSC-PLGA MPs were observed to be spherical shapes ( Figure 13 ) [53] . It was also found that oral immunization of BmpB-loaded PLGA microparticles coated with CKS9-conjugated chitosan in mice showed elevated secretory IgA responses in the mucosal tissue and systemic IgG antibody responses ( Figure 14) owing to the M-cell targeting and transcytosis ability of CKS9-conjugated chitosan-coated PLGA microparticles (Figure 15 ).",

Generally, there are two kinds of method for screening peptide ligands: chemical synthesis and phage display. Yoo et al. [52] screened M cell-targeting nine-peptide ligands of CKSTHPLSC (CKS9) by the phage display technique, and confirmed the target specificity by an in vitro transcytosis assay and in vivo assay. The CKS9 was conjugated to water-soluble chitosan (Figure 11) , and CKS9-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles (CKS9-CNs) prepared by ionic gelation were accumulated into Peyer's patches regions in greater amounts than chitosan nanoparticles (Figure 12 ), which suggests that the CKS9-CNs are effective vaccine carriers. They also conjugated CKS9 with chitosan to coat porous PLGA microparticles to deliver Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (BmpB) as a swine dysentery vaccine, and the porous surface and internal morphologies of BmpB-PLGA and BmpB-WSC-PLGA MPs were observed to be spherical shapes ( Figure 13 ) [53] . It was also found that oral immunization of BmpB-loaded PLGA microparticles coated with CKS9-conjugated chitosan in mice showed elevated secretory IgA responses in the mucosal tissue and systemic IgG antibody responses ( Figure 14 ) owing to the M-cell targeting and transcytosis ability of CKS9-conjugated chitosan-coated PLGA microparticles ( Figure 15 ).

DNA vaccine-encoded proteins mimic the antigens expressed after viral infection, hence possessing the advantages of safety over live attenuated vaccines and further improving the activation of the immune system. Xu et al. [60] prepared chitosan-DNA vaccine complexes to induce CVB3 specific immune responses via intranasal administration. As shown in Figure 17 , after immunization with chitosan-DNA (pcDNA3-VP1) encoding VP1 on mice, much higher levels of mucosal secretory IgA and serum IgG were produced when compared with groups immunized with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-VP1. Additionally, 42.9 percent of mice treated with chitosan-pcDNA3-VP1 were protected against lethal CVB3 challenge, and the viral load that happened after acute CVB3 infection was also significantly reduced. Zhou et al. [61] developed a novel approach for delivering HBV DNA vaccine more efficiently into APCs via PEI/DNA complexes entrapped in MC microspheres. Compared with naked DNA, enhanced antibody responses were realized by MC microspheres at all doses and time points evaluated. In addition, the time required for detectable antibody responses following immunization was shortened by two weeks with MC microspheres. Similarly, for the purpose of providing pDNA vaccines with an adjuvant-equipped carrier system, Heuking et al. [62] modified chitosan with a Toll-like receptor (TLR-7) agonistic moiety via a PEG linker. The results showed that TLR-7 agonist-modified chitosan significantly increased the interleukin-8-related immune stimulatory ability in human THP-1 macrophages compared with controls.",

The results showed that AC NPs were aggregated, having micrometer sizes after forming complexes with DNA vaccine in pH < 2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH ( Figure 18B) , which was an indication of the degree of pH dependence of the complexes. AC NPs have also been used to inhibit the tumor in an orthotopic breast cancer model, and it was found that the complexes showed excellent tumor inhibition ( Figure 18C ).

            "text": "Induction of an immune response by administrating DNA vaccine provides an alternative to other types of vaccination. DNA vaccine-encoded proteins mimic the antigens expressed after viral infection, hence possessing the advantages of safety over live attenuated vaccines and further improving the activation of the immune system. Xu et al. [60] prepared chitosan-DNA vaccine complexes to induce CVB3 specific immune responses via intranasal administration. As shown in Figure 17 , after immunization with chitosan-DNA (pcDNA3-VP1) encoding VP1 on mice, much higher levels of mucosal secretory IgA and serum IgG were produced when compared with groups immunized with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-VP1. Additionally, 42.9 percent of mice treated with chitosan-pcDNA3-VP1 were protected against lethal CVB3 challenge, and the viral load that happened after acute CVB3 infection was also significantly reduced. Zhou et al. [61] developed a novel approach for delivering HBV DNA vaccine more efficiently into APCs via PEI/DNA complexes entrapped in MC microspheres. Compared with naked DNA, enhanced antibody responses were realized by MC microspheres at all doses and time points evaluated. In addition, the time required for detectable antibody responses following immunization was shortened by two weeks with MC microspheres. Similarly, for the purpose of providing pDNA vaccines with an adjuvant-equipped carrier system, Heuking et al. [62] modified chitosan with a Toll-like receptor (TLR-7) agonistic moiety via a PEG linker. The results showed that TLR-7 agonist-modified chitosan significantly increased the interleukin-8-related immune stimulatory ability in human THP-1 macrophages compared with controls.",
