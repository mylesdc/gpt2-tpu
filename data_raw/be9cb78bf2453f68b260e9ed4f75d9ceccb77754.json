A total of 4132 adult patients on dialysis were enrolled prospectively between August 2008 and September 2014. Among them, we included 1738 patients who maintained dialysis for at least 3 months and had available SUA in the database. We categorized the time averaged-SUA (TA-SUA) into 5 groups: <5.5, 5.5-6.4, 6.5-7.4, 7.5-8.4, and \u22658.5 mg/dL. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality according to SUA group. The mean TA-SUA level was slightly higher in men than in women. Patients with lower TA-SUA level tended to have lower body mass index (BMI), phosphorus, serum albumin level, higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (DM), and higher proportion of malnourishment on the subjective global assessment (SGA). During a median follow-up of 43.9 months, 206 patients died. Patients with the highest SUA had a similar risk to the middle 3 TA-SUA groups, but the lowest TA-SUA group had a significantly elevated HR for mortality. The lowest TA-SUA group was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.720; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-2.937; P = 0.047) even after adjusting for demographic, comorbid, nutritional covariables, and medication use that could affect SUA levels. This association was prominent in patients with well nourishment on the SGA, a preserved serum albumin level, a higher BMI, and concomitant DM although these parameters had no significant interaction in the TA-SUA-mortality relationship except DM. In conclusion, a lower TA-SUA level <5.5 mg/dL predicted all-cause mortality in patients with chronic dialysis.",

            "text": "Unlike the majority of mammals, uric acid is the final product of purine nucleotide metabolism in humans because of the loss of uricase activity during evolution. [1] This loss of uricase activity, the uric acid balance in the kidneys, and lifestyle changes with eating habits are associated with a recent high prevalence of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia causes uric acid crystals to deposit in the joints and kidneys, and consequently causes gout and chronic interstitial nephritis. Moreover, increasing data suggest that a higher serum uric acid (SUA) level may be a risk factor or biomarker for both renal and cardiovascular outcomes in a range of populations. In the general population, a higher SUA level is linked to the development of new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) [2] [3] [4] and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). [5, 6] In addition, an elevation of SUA level has been shown to be associated with hypertension, [7] diabetes mellitus (DM), metabolic syndrome, coronary disease, [8] and even cardiovascular mortality. [8] [9] [10] The association between the SUA level and patients' outcome seems complex in those with kidney disease. In humans, twothird of the uric acid produced is eliminated in the urine. Therefore, the SUA concentration is determined by both the rate of purine metabolism and the efficiency of renal clearance. Consequently, an elevation of the SUA level is highly prevalent in patients with CKD. [11, 12] This makes it difficult to determine a causal or coincidental relationship between the SUA level and outcome in the CKD population compared with the general population. Previous studies on the effect of the SUA level on either a decline in renal function or cardiovascular disease have controversial findings. [13] [14] [15] Additionally, higher SUA levels have been reported to be associated with increased [16, 17] or Editor: Pavlos Malindretos.

[27] It is thought that SUA contributes to more than half of the antioxidant capacity of blood. [28, 29] This antioxidative potential of SUA may be protective in patients with ESRD who have higher oxidative stress than individuals with preserved renal function. Therefore, we hypothesized that a lower SUA level may increase the mortality risk in patients with ESRD. To prove this hypothesis, we explored the association between the SUA level and mortality in patients with ESRD by using a nationwide representative prospective ESRD cohort in Korea. Because SUA may be influenced on various conditions such as dialysis modality, efficiency of dialysis, and nutritional status, we used time-averaged SUA (TA-SUA) to represent SUA level more precisely in dialysis patients.",

In terms of the nonlinear spline curve, there was an overall U-shape association between the TA-SUA level and adjusted log HR.

            "text": "In this study, we explored the relationship between the TA-SUA level and all-cause mortality in maintenance dialysis patients. SUA level was easily affected by diet, efficiency of dialysis, and drugs. Notably, we used the TA-SUA from the blood samples that were collected prior to dialysis and meal, instead of a single-baseline measurement of SUA. We found that distribution of the TA-SUA level was not much different according to sex as much in the general population. As we expected, the TA-SUA level was associated with patients' nutritional status. We also demonstrated that a lower TA-SUA level, especially the lowest (<5.5 mg/dL), among our dialysis groups was independently associated with all-cause mortality, over a median follow-up of 43.9 months. This relationship remained significant after considering the nutritional status and any other parameters associated with the TA-SUA levels. The reference range of SUA is typically 3.4 to 7.2 mg/dL (200-430 mmol/L) for men and 2.4 to 6.1 mg/dL (140-360 mmol/ \u00c00.067 0.002 * B, regression coefficient with serum uric acid levels.Adjusted for age, sex, dialysis type, total Kt/V, BMI, SGA, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, diabetes, gout, uricosuric drugs, antiuricosuric drugs. BMI = body mass index, CAD = coronary artery disease, CVD = cerebrovascular disease, HD = hemodialysis, hs-CRP = high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SGA = subjective global assessment. L) for women. Such a sex difference has been well described in previous studies performed in the general population. [33] In patients on dialysis, there are limited data about sex differences of the SUA level distribution. A few previous studies have shown that the SUA level of men is higher than that of women by >0.5 mg/dL. [16, 34] In our study, the difference was <0.3 mg/dL, but it was significant. The reason for this difference in our cohort remains uncertain. An advanced age and menopausal status, [35, 36] impaired renal uric acid excretion state, and sex hormonal dysfunction in the uremic status [37] may affect the SUA metabolism, although further studies are warranted to clarify this smaller sex difference of the SUA level and its mechanism. The relationship between the SUA level and mortality in those with ESRD has been explored in 5 HD cohorts [16, [19] [20] [21] 38] and 3 PD cohorts, [25, 26, 39] and the results were diverse. Several studies showed that a low SUA level may be harmful against mortality, [16, [19] [20] [21] 26] whereas others insisted that hyperuricemia increased mortality. [25, 38] One study even reported that the prognostic value of SUA on mortality was weak, and it may be confounded by traditional cardiovascular risk factors or uremia-related factors. [39] This heterogeneity may be derived by many confounders that affect SUA levels in patients on dialysis.",

            "text": "First, SUA can be considered one of the nutritional factors in patients on dialysis. A recent study clarified the association between SUA levels and the nutritional status in patients on HD. [34] Therefore, nutritional markers should be finely adjusted to demonstrate the independent prognostic value of SUA on mortality in patients with ESRD. In our prospective study, we considered all possible nutritional factors, including the SGA, BMI, serum albumin, and phosphorus levels. BMI is a paradoxical variable for mortality in patients with ESRD. [40] Hypoalbuminemia is also well established as a potent independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis. [41] Aside from laboratory markers, we also considered the SGA, which represents the overall concepts of nutritional factors such as the subjects' recent weight change, dietary intake, and gastrointestinal symptoms, loss of subcutaneous fat, and signs of muscle wasting. [42] In patients with ESRD, the SGA was an independent predictor for mortality in a large longitudinal cohort study. [43] In our subgroup analyses, an independent role of the lowest SUA level on elevated mortality was prominent in the well-nourished (on SGA), higher BMI, and higher serum albumin level group than each counterpart. This implies that the SUA level is not a simple marker that reflects the nutritional status of patients with chronic dialysis. Another important issue to address is that both hyper-and hypouricemia can be associated with an increased mortality. Two previous studies on patients on PD illustrated this common concept by showing that hyperuricemia was associated with an increased all-cause, especially cardiovascular mortality. [25, 26] However, 1 study enrolled patients with a relatively young age and fewer comorbidities compared with our cohort. [26] The other study had some limitations, including a small sample size and short follow-up duration. [25] Our study participants were observed prospectively at nationally distributed multicenters, and therefore they are representative of real-world patients with chronic dialysis. Our study demonstrated that a lower TA-SUA level increased the all-cause mortality in patients with chronic dialysis. The SUA is a powerful scavenger for oxygen-free radicals and acts as one of the most important antioxidants in human biological fluids. [27, 44] There is enough evidence that a lower SUA level is associated with inflammatory and degenerative diseases. [22, 29, [45] [46] [47] [48] In patients on dialysis, it was found that the total antioxidant capacity was correlated with SUA levels due to primarily higher levels of SUA. [49] Therefore, it is possible that a lower SUA level results in a reduced total antioxidant capacity in patients on dialysis, although further investigations are warranted to clarify the precise mechanisms.",

Table 4 Cause of death according to time-averaged serum uric acid groups. SUA as an antioxidant in patients on dialysis, and we used TA-SUA instead of single SUA measurement to minimize fluctuating effect of SUA. However, several limitations should be noted. First, we could obtain only partial information about medication that may have changed the SUA levels. Since this study had a prospective cohort design, we did not obtain this information at the time of the study design. Although we could not gather the medication for gout treatment, but we could adjust gout history, uricosuric agents, and antiuricosuric agents. Even after adjusted the gout and drugs affecting SUA levels, the TA-SUA <5.5 mg/dL was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. Second, we also could not consider the other antioxidative parameters that may provide one of the relationships between SUA and antioxidant capacity. Among the usual laboratory tests, total bilirubin and gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) have been considered markers of oxidative stress. Some of our collaborators have already demonstrated that high serum GGT levels were an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in PD patients by using the same cohort. [50] Unfortunately, serum GGT levels were collected in only 836 (39.7%) patients of our cohort, so we could not include serum GGT levels as a covariate in our regression analysis. Furthermore, total bilirubin levels were not collected in this prospective cohort. Further translational research may be warranted to demonstrate the precise antioxidative effect of SUA on mortality.",
