The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were retrieved from the antimicrobial peptide database (APD3) and shortlisted based on certain important physicochemical properties. The binding mode of the shortlisted peptides was measured based on the number of clusters which forms in a protein-peptide docking using Piper. As a result, we identified a list of putative AMPs which binds to the spike protein of MERS-CoV, which may be crucial in providing the inhibitory action. It is observed that seven putative peptides have good binding score based on cluster size cutoff of 208. We conclude that seven peptides, namely, AP00225, AP00180, AP00549, AP00744, AP00729, AP00764, and AP00223, could possibly have binding with the active site of the MERS-CoV spike protein. These seven AMPs could serve as a therapeutic option for MERS and enhance its treatment outcome.",

In this scenario, peptides can serve as potential treatment option for MERS. It has been shown that peptides act as modulators in viral diseases. For example, Melnik et al. [3] shortlisted nine peptides based on the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS), where four of these peptides (WWIHS = 3.5) had greater than 50% inhibition of human cytomegalovirus. In another study, it was shown that several peptides with WWIHS = 5.2 inhibited multiple strains of influenza with IC 50 \u2264 1 M [4] . By and large, other peptides with positive WWIHS values have been shown to inhibit various viruses such as Rift Valley Fever [5] , Dengue, White Nile [6] , and SARS [7] and the mechanism of action is by interfering with fusion of host cellular and 2 Advances in Bioinformatics viral glycoprotein membranes [8] . It is for these reasons we propose that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can be used as an effective therapeutic agents against MERS. Several peptides have been extensively studied and identified as anti-MERS-CoV peptides [9] [10] [11] [12] and anti-MERS-CoV AMPs in the past few years [13] .",

Understanding the S protein structure is useful in the drug discovery for developing anti-MERS-CoV components. The S protein consists of S1 and S2 regions and it is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is located at the viral envelope surface in a trimer state. The S1 and S2 subunits play a role in viral entry, binding, and fusion [14] . The S1 subunit has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The S2 subunit consists of heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), which forms a complex called the fusion core, and represents a key membrane fusion architecture [14] . During the process of membrane fusion, HR1 and HR2 regions form a six helix bundle core with a hydrophobic region being inserted into the host membrane and thereby fusion occurs [15] .",

X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis are techniques used in determining protein complexes and consequently protein interfaces. However, these techniques are expensive; hence, an in silico approach in predicting protein interaction, protein-protein docking, and protein interface is needed. Protein-peptide docking methods can be divided into three categories: template-based docking; local docking; and global docking [16] . Example of proteinprotein interactions includes the use of graphical models by predicting the binding site between two proteins [17] . Protein interface prediction involves determining a subset of residues on the protein surface which are involved in intermolecular interactions. Example of prediction of protein interfaces includes ComplexContact, which is a web server for determining interfacial residue-residue contact prediction of a putative protein complex. This is useful in deciphering how proteins form a complex by looking at how their residues interact [18] . The challenges faced in developing these computational methods are that no methods yield excellent results and there is no gold standard benchmark dataset that can be used to compare them [19] . In addition, there are other challenges like (i) modelling significant conformational changes of both peptide and protein molecules, (ii) selection of the highest accuracy structure out of many generated models, and (iii) integration of experimental data and computational predictions into the protein-peptide docking scheme [16] .",

In particular, we have used Protein Interactions Calculator (PIC) to recognize the interactions within the bound complexes. In structural bioinformatics, predicting protein-protein interactions which stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structures is an important task. For the top best four AMPs-MERS-CoV complexes with the best cluster size were subjected to PIC server and the binding mode (interactions) of each peptide are given in Table 5 . PIC identified interactions such as hydrophobic residues interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, aromatic-aromatic interactions and aromatic-sulphur interactions within the peptide-protein complexes. According to the PIC server results as shown in Table 5 , AP00225 forms hydrophobic interactions with Val790, Tyr1142, Phe764, Leu731, Ile768, Pro1143, Pro767, and Val770; hydrogen bond interactions with Pro730; and ionic interactions with Gln792 and Ser734 as shown in Table 5 . AP00180 forms hydrophobic interactions with Ala1007, Val790, Leu731, Pro767, Ile768, and Tyr1142; hydrogen bond interactions with Gly789 and Pro730; and ionic interactions with Glu1017 and Asp740 as shown in Table 5 . AP00549 forms hydrophobic interactions with Ala1049, Pro59, Tyr64, Tyr928, Val929, Ala930, Ala920, Ile69, and Tyr71; hydrogen bond interactions with Ala1049 and Gly61; and ionic interactions with Arg1057, Arg62, and Asp922 as shown in Table 5 .

These residues may be considered as critical residues. AP00549 have overlapping residues with experimentally validated anti-MERS-CoV peptide P9, as highlighted in bold (Table 5 ) and Figure 4 (a), while AP00225, AP00180, and AP00744 have common residues with HR2P as highlighted in italic (Table 5 ) and Figure 4 (b). The binding of the peptide AP00549 has the same binding region as P9; AP00225, AP00180, and AP00744 have the same binding region as shown in Figures 5 and 6 . The binding of the peptides to the receptor spike and ligands includes AP00179, AP00260, AP00340, AP02733, P9, and HR2P; see ",

The receptor used is the prefusion state of the S protein, because it is a type I fusion protein, which undergoes a nonreversible conformational change that results in the postfusion form of the protein. In postfusion, the protein has refolded and the membranes have undergone fusion, or the spike protein has been spent.

It has been hypothesized that positive interfacial hydrophobicity of a peptide increases the chances for membrane binding, that is, interacting with the viral P9 AP00549 hydrophobic surfaces and hence inhibiting fusion and entry of the virus [8] . Therefore, since the best five putative AMPs have higher values of interfacial hydrophobicity, we can infer that their mechanism of action is by inhibiting fusion and hence blocking entry of the virus into the host cell. The mechanism of action for the positive controls, namely, P9 [13] and HR2P [10] has been experimentally validated to inhibit viral fusion. Nevertheless, these five putative anti-MERS-CoV AMPs have same values as positive control peptides in terms of WWHIS and iHMM values and also on an average sequence length. In order to characterize binding properties of AMPs with the spike protein S2, we used Piper, which involves peptide-protein interaction, in which it determines the bestfit orientation of ligand with receptor [25] . The binding affinity is determined by Piper cluster size and not scores or probability. The docking score together with probability can give confidence on the binding and which are lacking in our study since we used cluster size as criteria for ranking best poses. However, it has been hypothesized that the best way to rank docking is by cluster size, which can be useful in informing experimental approaches [25] . In this study, we selected five peptides which had higher cluster value than experimentally validated anti-MERS-CoV peptide, P9 [13] . Nevertheless, these peptides have good binding with MERS-CoV spike protein (S2) in terms of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.",

However, the results are preliminary and certainly need experimental confirmation using in vitro and in vivo experiments essential to validate them.
