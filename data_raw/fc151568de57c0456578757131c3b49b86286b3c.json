General strategies to design specific and selective drugs targeting helicase for the treatment of viral infections could act via one or more of the following mechanisms: inhibition of the NTPase activity, by interferences with ATP binding and therefore by limiting the energy required for the unwinding and translocation, or by allosteric mechanism and therefore by stabilizing the conformation of the enzyme in low helicase activity state; inhibition of nucleic acids binding to the helicase; inhibition of coupling of ATP hydrolysis to unwinding; inhibition of unwinding by sterically blocking helicase translocation. Recently, by in vitro screening studies, it has been reported that several benzotriazole, imidazole, imidazodiazepine, phenothiazine, quinoline, anthracycline, triphenylmethane, tropolone, pyrrole, acridone, small peptide, and Bananin derivatives are endowed with helicase inhibition of pathogen viruses belonging to Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae families.",

The ATP-binding site of helicase is completed by an arginine \"finger\" and a catalytic base, which accepts a proton from the attacking water molecule. In related proteins, this catalytic base has been demonstrated to be a conserved glutamate near the Walker B motif [27, 28] . Arginine amino acids often interact with the beta and gamma phosphates of the bound ATP, stabilizing the transition state [29, 30] , Figure 1 .",

Human papillomavirus helicase is an SF3, ring, 3 -5 DNA helicase. The functional importance of helicases means that inhibitors or modulators for these enzymes are potentially important as therapeutic agents. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the development of highly selective inhibitors as antiviral and anticancer drugs for clinical uses. Developing nontoxic helicase inhibitors as antiviral drugs is considerably more difficult than developing drugs designed to inhibit other viral enzymes. In fact, in contrast with proteases and polymerases, the helicasesdependent reactions are still not fully elucidated. Furthermore, the helicase ATP-binding site is conserved not only in all the classes of helicases, but also in other proteins necessary for the cellular lifecycle, such as small GTPases, kinases, the AAA + family (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), and even the mitochondrial ATP synthase (F1 ATPase). Thus, compounds that inhibit helicases via their ATP-binding sites could have toxic effects on the host cells.",

The hydrolysis of ATP supplies the energy that allows the helicase to adopt various nucleotide ligation states that allosterically cause conformational changes in the nucleic acid binding site to drive the movement of the helicase along the length of the nucleic acid chain [19] . So, competitive NTPase inhibitors may lead to decreased ATPase activity and therefore to reduction of the unwinding rate. Consequently, non-(or slowly) hydrolysable ATP-analogs seemed to be effective tools for inhibiting the helicase activity, like adenosine-5 \u03b3-thiotriphosphate (ATP-\u03b3-S), which is used to determine a low level of unwinding of HCV dsRNA [44, 45] . However, ribavirin 5 -triphosphate (RTP), that inhibits the HCV NTPase/helicase by a competitive mechanism in regard to ATP [46] , and ribavirin 5 -diphosphate (RDP), both reported in Figure 3 , even showing IC 50 values in the micromolar range, demonstrates to determine only a weakly enzymatic inhibition [34] . The same behavior has been put in evidence for paclitaxel, compound structurally nonrelated to NTP. This derivative is able to block the NTPbinding site (IC 50 = 22 \u03bcM) and to inhibit the ATPase activity (IC 50 = 17 \u03bcM) in a competitive way, but is not able to inhibit the helicase activity at concentration lower than 1 mM [14] The partial unwinding activity mediated by these competitive NTPase inhibitors is common to all members of the class, and the concentrations needed for the helicase inhibition usually exceed the IC 50 value by 3-5 times. At these concentrations, the NTPase activity reached 10-35% of the control [46] [47] [48] . The basis for the phenomenon remains unclear.",

QU663 could function as a competitive inhibitor with respect to nucleic acid substrate by decreasing the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. Molecular docking studies further support this explanation.

About ten thousand cases of SARS worldwide, including 800 deaths, were reported in 2003 (WHO data). Although this initial global outbreak, SARS appears to has been successfully contained, but it remains a serious concern because no vaccine or effective drug treatment is actually available. Recently, Tanner and coworkers have found that Bananin and three of their derivatives, Figure 25 , function as noncompetitive SARS-CoV helicase inhibitors (with IC 50 values in the micromolar range) at a site different from the ATP and nucleic acid binding site, causing inhibition probably through an allosteric mechanism [89] . In foetal rhesus kidney-4cells infected with SARS-Cov, Bananin inhibited the viral replication (IC 50 = 10 \u03bcM) with low host cellular toxicity (CC 50 = 390 \u03bcM) [89] . Finally, in the last years various molecules have been detected showing an interesting and promising anti-Coronaviridae activity. Unfortunately, for many of them, was not identified a clear molecular target or mechanism of action. The fact remains that the eventual target could be the NS3 helicase. With this in mind, we report briefly the new classes of compounds that have emerged in recent published works. Among them glycopeptide antibiotics [90] , which seem to interfere with the Coronavirus entry process but do not exclude an unknown cellular target; pyridine N-oxide derivatives [91] ; plant lectins [92] , which most probably interfere with the glycans on the spike protein during virus entry and virus release; phenanthroindolizines and phenanthroquinolizidines [93] ; tetrahydroquinoline oxocarbazate derivatives as inhibitor of human cathepsin L and as entry blockers [94] . including meningitis, colds, heart infection, conjunctivitis, and hepatitis.",

This is well quantified by the value of the solvent accessible volume of this new class of inhibitors, which on average has almost doubled compared to that of the previous molecular series (e.g., 1672\u00c5 3 versus 891\u00c5 3 , resp.). Accordingly, it is impossible for the protein pocket to host N,N -bis[4-(1H(2H)-benzotriazol-1(2)-yl) phenyl]alkyldicarboxamides with the same binding mode, and the results form the docking study reveal that only one of the two identical inhibitors moieties can be positioned well within the binding pocket. However, in correspondence of the most favored binding mode for the most active compounds, the formation of a new, small network of Hbonds between 89f and enzyme was observed. In particular, the analysis of the trajectories of the MD simulations for the 89f/helicase complex as an example indicates that there is a constant presence of an H-bond which involves the carbonyl oxygen atom of the Asn179 side chain and the triazole N(1) atom of the drug, characterized by an average dynamic length (ADL) of 3.0\u00c5. At the same time, it is possible to verify the formation of other two H-bond interactions, the former between the C=O backbone group of Ser221 and the NH group of the amidic moiety of 89f (ADL = 1.6\u00c5), and the latter between the carbonyl oxygen atom of the C=O group of the same amidic moiety of 89f and the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser221 (ADL = 2.6\u00c5). Compounds 89i-k also exhibited selectivity against Coxsackie B2CVB-2. Unfortunately, homology standard techniques were not able to produce a reliable 3D model for the CVB-2 virus helicase, due to very low sequence identities found during alignment processes.",

The putative binding site proposed by Carta and coworkers for Sb-1 is composed by 30 residues and, according to their 2D alignment, the binding site for CVB-2 differs for 7 residues only. Among these, Ser296 in Sb-1 is mutated to Arg237 in CBV-2. Following their analysis, and a preliminary visual inspection based on the swapping of Ser to Arg in the Polio helicase, they concluded that this is the most important residue in the case of compounds 89i-k, featuring chlorine atoms as substituents. In fact, the positively charged side chain of Arg237 is placed at an average distance of 3.5\u00c5 from the Cl atoms, thus sensibly resulting is strong electrostatic interactions between the inhibitor and the protein. These speculations, which may account in part for the selectivity of these compounds with respect to CVB-2, clearly await further confirmation from the simulations performed on the corresponding protein 3D models.",
