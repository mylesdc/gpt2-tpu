Nsp1 has been shown to have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of coronaviruses in vivo. To assess the function of a relatively conserved domain (LLRKxGxKG) of MHV nsp1, a mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, with a 27 nts (LLRKxGxKG) deletion in nsp1, was constructed using a reverse genetic system with a vaccinia virus vector. The mutant virus had similar growth kinetics to MHV-A59 wild-type virus in 17CI-1 cells, but was highly attenuated in vivo. Moreover, the mutant virus completely protected C57BL/6 mice from a lethal MHV-A59 challenge. To further analyze the mechanism of the attenuation of the mutant virus, changes in reporter gene expression were measured in nsp1-or nsp1-27D-expressing cells; the results showed that nsp1 inhibited reporter gene expression controlled by different promoters, but that this inhibition was reduced for nsp1-27D. The research in vivo and in vitro suggests that the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 may play an important role in this process.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are divided into three groups. Group I viruses, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and Group II viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS, infect mammals, whereas group III viruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), infect avian species. Coronavirus genomes are extraordinarily large, with sizes ranging from 27 to 32 kilobases (kb). One-third of the genome consists of the structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as accessory proteins specific to different strains. Approximately twothirds of the genome encodes, in a single open reading frame (ORF), non-structural replicase proteins (nsp) that are involved in viral RNA synthesis. Many of the coronavirus nsp proteins have been shown, or are predicted, to have enzymatic functions, including papain-like cysteine proteinases (nsp3), 3C-like cysteine proteinase (nsp5), RNA-primase (nsp8), 29O-MTase cofactor (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), 59-39 helicase (nsp13), 39-59 exonuclease (nsp14), endoribonuclease (nsp15) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent (nucleoside-29O)-methyltransferase (29O-MTase, nsp16) and RNA cap N7-methyltransferase activity (nsp14) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Nsp1 is the N-terminal cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein and is the first mature viral protein expressed in the host cell cytoplasm. Deletion of the nsp1coding region in infectious clones of MHV yielded viruses that were unable to productively infect cultured cells. Furthermore, exogenous expression of MHV nsp1 in mammalian cells arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inhibited cell proliferation [10, 11] . SARS-CoV nsp1 protein induces degradation of host mRNA and suppression of translation both in nsp1-expressing cells and in SARS-CoV-infected cells [12] . In vivo studies have suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 may counteract the host innate immune responses, thereby providing a survival advantage for the virus [13, 14] . Overall, these observations indicate that nsp1 may participate in multiple stages of the coronavirus life cycle, and implicate this protein as a potentially important virulence factor. Nsp1 sequences are divergent among the different coronaviruses, and this has made it challenging to identify the functional domains of nsp1. Sequence alignment has revealed that there is a region (LLRKxGxKG: amino acids 191-199) in nsp1 that is conserved in various coronaviruses, such as MHV and SARS-CoV ( Figure 1 ) [15] . This conserved region may be an important functional domain, and hence a candidate region for deletion in order to generate an attenuated vaccine.",

The growth kinetics of both wild-type (WT) MHV-A59 and mutant viruses were determined by infecting murine 17Cl-1 cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The plaque morphology of MHV-nsp1-27D was the same as that of WT MHV-A59 (data not shown). Both mutant and WT viruses began to replicate at 8 h post-infection (p.i.), and reached maximal titers at 12 h p.i. The maximal titer of MHV-nsp1-27D was about 5610 5 pfu/ml, a little lower than that of WT MHV-A59 (1610 6 pfu/ml). Viral growth and the peak titer of MHV-nsp1-27D were different from those of WT MHV-A59 ( Figure 3C ). To assess the stability of the recombinant virus, the nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp1-27D was sequenced after five passages in tissue culture; sequence analysis showed that no nucleotide changes were detected ( Figure 3A , B).",

In order to determine whether the attenuated mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, could confer protection against challenge with WT MHV-A59, groups of C57BL/6 mice were either immunized with MHV-nsp1-27D, or treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. Two-weeks p.i., mice were challenged with WT MHV-A59 by the same route, and the mortality determined 14 days post-challenge ( Figure 7) . The results showed that 70% of the PBS-immunized mice died on or before day 7 after the MHV-A59 challenge. In contrast, intraperitoneal vaccination with 5.0610 3 pfu/mouse of the MHV-nsp1-27D mutant completely protected mice from the lethal dose (5610 6 pfu) of WT MHV-A59. For the intracranial route, vaccination with either 200 or 2610 4 pfu/mouse of the mutant virus MHV-nsp1-27D was sufficient to achieve complete protection against challenge with 2610 4 pfu/mouse of the WT MHV-A59 virus.

Some viruses indirectly antagonize the antiviral response by inhibiting the general mechanisms of host cell gene expression [18] [19] [20] . A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host cell gene expression, inducing generalized host cell mRNA degradation [12] . In order to reveal the potential role of the LLRKxGxKG region in the attenuation of the MHV-nsp1-27D mutant virus, we analyzed changes in reporter gene expression in cells expressing nsp1 or nsp1-27D. BHK-21 cells were co-transfected with different expression plasmids (pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-nsp1 or pcDNA3.1-nsp1-27D) and reporter plasmids. The activity of the reporter gene, luciferase, was assessed; this was under the control of the CMV and SV40 promoters, and the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE). The results showed that co-expression of MHV-nsp1 significantly reduced the luciferase activity ( Figure 8 ) by about 6-fold (P,0.01) for the CMV promoter, 3-fold (P,0.01) for the SV40 promoter and 3fold (P,0.01) for the ISRE. By comparison, co-expression of MHV-nsp1-27D significantly decreased luciferase activity by about 2-fold (P,0.01) for the CMV promoter, 1.5-fold (P,0.01) for the SV40 promoter and 1.5-fold (P,0.01) for the ISRE. Our results indicate that MHV nsp1 can suppress host cell gene expression, but that deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region attenuates this effect. This further suggests that the conserved region, LLRKxGxKG, may play an important role in the suppression of host cell gene expression.",

Amino acid sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and MHV-A59 nsp1 showed a relatively conserved domain, LRKxGxKG (L191-G199). Furthermore, analysis of the structure of SARS nsp1 indicated that this domain might be a candidate domain for mRNA interaction. Since the amino acids deleted in this study were included in the region K124-L241, which has been reported to have no effect on virus replication and the stability of NSP1 protein [10] , the deletion of LRKxGxKG region would not be expected to cause instability of NSP1. The use of reverse genetics to construct recombinant viruses has enabled us to identify important virulence factors, and has facilitated the rational design of live attenuated viral vaccines. This study demonstrates that an unprecedented level of attenuation is achieved through deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region in MHV-A59 nsp1. Firstly, we found that survival of C57BL/6 mice infected with MHV-nsp1-27D was higher than that of mice infected with MHV-A59, irrespective of whether the route of infection was intracranial or intraperitoneal. Secondly, the results showed that MHV-nsp1-27D was unable to cause acute hepatitis, as evidenced by the much lower serum ALT levels than those seen in mice infected with MHV-A59. Thirdly, in pathological investigations designed to explore the importance of the LLRKxGxKG region for virus virulence in vivo, intraperitoneal infection of mice with MHV-A59 or MHV-nsp1-27D revealed that both viruses replicated in the spleen and liver, but that MHV-nsp1-27D titers were consistently lower than those of MHV-A59. Collectively, these data indicate that MHV-nsp1-27D is strongly attenuated in vivo, but retains the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, immunization with mutant virus (5000 pfu/mouse intraperitoneally or 200 pfu/mouse intracranially) was sufficient to protect C57BL/6 mice from subsequent challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of WT MHV-A59. This strongly suggests that the mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, has potential for use as an attenuated live vaccine.",

The survival of mice was monitored daily. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061166.g007 European Collection of Cell Cultures (http://www.ecacc.org.uk/). 17Cl-1, L929 and HeLa-D980R cells were cultured at 37uC in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 5% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB). CV-1 and BHK-21 cells were cultured at 37uC in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with HEPES (25 mM), 5% FBS and antibiotics. The regulatable BHK-21 cell line, expressing the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein (BHK-MHV-N cells) under the control of the TET/ON system, was a kind gift from Prof. Stuart G. Siddell, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK;",

BHK-21 cells were co-transfected with pRLuc-CMV (CMV promoter), pGL3-control (SV40 promoter) or pLuc-ISRE (ISRE promoter), and the indicated expression plasmids. 24 h post transfection, the luciferase activity was measured. The results represent the means of at least four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student's ttest (* p,0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061166.g008",
