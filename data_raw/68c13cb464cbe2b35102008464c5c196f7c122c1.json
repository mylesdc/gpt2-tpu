The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses from extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4)",

This set of founder strains represents three subspecies of the house mouse Mus musculus (Yang et al. 2011) and, in large part due to the inclusion of three wild-derived founders (F-H), endows the CC panel with far greater genetic variation than previous RI panels derived solely from pairs of classical inbred strains. As an RI panel, the CC thus provides a diverse set of reproducible genomes and represents a powerful tool for genetic analysis (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Srivastava et al. 2017) . Indeed, although the CC RI panel has only become available in the last six years , it has already yielded new insights into human disease and basic mouse biology (Shusterman et al. 2013; Rogala et al. 2014; Rasmussen et al. 2014; Lor\u00e8 et al. 2015;  mapping in practice was also predicted by studies in the incipient CC lines (pre-CC) Durrant et al. 2011; Philip et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Ferris et al. 2013; Ram et al. 2014; Rutledge et al. 2014; Kelada 2016; Donoghue et al. 2017; Phillippi et al. 2014) .",

[Whereas cost grows proportional to the the number of strains, demand does not, and a much larger number of strains would threaten the economic viability of the operation (F. Pardo-Manuel de Villena, pers. comm.).] Nonetheless, subsets of the available CC strains have already been used to map QTL, as evidenced by a growing list of studies (Vered et al. 2014; Mosedale et al. 2017; Graham et al. 2017) . Beyond these successes, however, it is unclear how much the reduction in the number of strains has affected the ability to map QTL in the CC in general.",

(2006a) as being necessary to provide enough power both to map single QTL and for robust, genome-wide detection of epistasis. That estimate was based on simulations involving larger numbers (500-1,000) of hypothetical CC genomes. Those simulations, performed before any CC strains existed and with the goal of guiding the CC's design, had a broad scope, exploring the effect of varying strain numbers, alternative mapping approaches [association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) vs. association of inferred haplotypes], and alternative breeding strategies. As such, the power estimates that were reported do not reflect the number of CC strains now available, nor their actual, realized founder mosaic genomes. An updated, more focused power analysis that both exploits and works within the constraints of the realized genomes is therefore timely.",

In a follow-up DSPR power analysis, King and Long (2017) compared the DSPR with the related Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (Mackay et al. 2012) . They illustrated how QTL effect size differs between a population whose allele frequencies are more balanced (DSPR) vs. one whose allele frequencies are less balanced (DGRP). They also explored implications for cross-population and compared mapping power for bi-allelic QTL, based on single SNPs, and multi-allelic QTL constructed from actual adjacent SNPs within genes.",

(2012) applied to genotype calls from MegaMUGA, a genotyping platform providing data on 77,800 SNP markers (Morgan et al. 2016) . The HMM inference provides a vector of 36 probabilities for each CC strain for each of 77,551 loci (each defined as the interval between adjacent SNP markers) across the genome. Rather than using all of the available data for our simulations, we used a reduced version: since adjacent loci often have almost identical descent, mapping using all loci is both computationally expensive and-at least for the purposes of the power analysis-largely redundant. Thus, prior to analysis, the original dataset was reduced by averaging adjacent genomic intervals whose diplotype probabilities were highly similar. Specifically, adjacent genomic intervals were averaged if the maximum L2 norm between the probability vectors of all individuals is less than 10% of the maximum possible L2 norm ( ffiffi ffi 2 p ); this reduced the file storage from 610 MB to 288 MB, and the genome from 77,551 to 17,900 intervals (76.9% reduction in positions to be evaluated in a scan).",

As such, the proportion of variance explained by the QTL in the mapping population will deviate from h 2 QTL due to imbalance in both M and D. Conversely, for a given h 2 QTL , the allelic values at a QTL will be constant across populations.

Additional factors that might contribute to variation in an experiment, such as covariates or batch effects, are neither simulated nor modeled; it is assumed that such factors would be adequately accounted for by, for instance, addition of suitable covariates, pre-processing (e.g., residualizing) of phenotype values, and ultimately lead to a more-or-less equivalent analysis to that described here.

These features support the assumption of exchangeability among strain genomes: that under a null model in which the genetic contribution to the phenotype is entirely driven by infinitesimal (polygenic) effects, all permutations of the strain labels (or equivalently, of the strain means vector y \u00f0s\u00de ) are equally likely to produce a given configuration of y \u00f0s\u00de . Permutation of the strain means, y \u00f0s\u00de , was therefore used to find the logP critical value controlling genome-wide type I error rate (GWER) (Doerge and Churchill 1996) . Briefly, we sampled 100 permutations and perform genome scans for each; this was done efficiently using a standard matrix decomposition approach (Appendix A). The maximum logPs per genome scan and simulation s were then recorded, and these are fitted to a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) (Dudbridge and Koeleman 2004; Valdar et al. 2006a ) using the R package evir (Pfaff and McNeil 2018) . The upper a \u00bc 0:05 quantile of this fitted GEV was then taken as the a-level significance threshold, T \u00f0s\u00de a . If the maximum observed logP for y \u00f0s\u00de in the region of the simulated QTL exceeded T \u00f0s\u00de a , then the corresponding locus was considered to be a (positively) detected QTL (see immediately below).",

(LD has been characterized in the CC previously but not summarized with a single point estimate (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012); our choice of 5Mb is therefore an approximation, but we find that it only marginally increased mapping power relative to using smaller windows.) A false positive was declared if one or more QTL were detected on chromosomes other than the chromosome harboring the simulated QTL. Simulations in which a QTL was detected on the correct chromosome but outside the 5Mb window were disregarded; although this was potentially wasteful of data and biased FPR slightly downward due to loss of false positives on the chromosome with the simulated QTL, it avoided the need for arbitrary rules to handle edge cases in which it was ambiguous whether the simulated signal had been detected or not. Power for a given simulation setting was then defined as the proportion of true positives among all simulations at that setting, and the FPR was defined as the proportion of false positives.",

Given our criterion for calling true positives, the maximum distance was necessarily 5Mb, and experimental settings that correspond to low power would be expected to have fewer data points, yielding estimates that are unstable. In order to obtain more stable estimates, we used a regularization procedure, estimating the mean distance and 95% quantiles as weighted averages of the observed values and prior pseudo-observations. Specifically, for an arbitrarily small but detected true positive QTL, it is reasonable to expect the peak signal to be distributed uniformly within the 6 5Mb window. This implies a mean location error of 2.5Mb and a 95% quantile of 4.75Mb. Thus, when calculating the regularized mean location error we assumed 10 prior pseudo-observations of 2.5Mb, and when calculating the regularized 95% quantile we assume 10 prior pseudo-observations of 4.75Mb.

This demonstrates that, when strain effects are large relative to individual error (i.e., highly heritable trait, or the use of many replicates), failure to account for population structure due to realized imbalance in founder contributions can increase the risk of false positives.",

This differs from the simulations of Valdar et al. (2006a) , which primarily focused on comparing potential breeding designs with numbers of strains that far exceed (500-1,000) the population now realized (50-70). As such, directly comparing these studies is challenging. The closest comparison case is for a 5% QTL with 45% background strain effect in 100 simulated strains with 10 replicates, for which Valdar et al. (2006a) estimates 4% power. Matching those settings with the exception of 72 strains instead of 100, and using the DAMB definition of QTL effect size, we find 0.4% power. The relatively lower power with the realized data likely reflects both reduction in the number of strains by 28% (72 to 100) and the deviations from an ideally-randomized population, such as the observed reduction in contributions from the CAST and PWK founders (Srivastava et al. 2017) . This emphasizes the challenge in projecting the results from Valdar n We did not attempt power simulations with epistatic QTL or phenotypes with large background strain effect. From the results of Valdar et al. (2006a) , it was clear that mapping studies in the realized CC, even with replicates, would not be well-powered in those contexts. Nonetheless, despite the reduced number of strains, we found that successful mapping experiments can be designed in the realized CC, particularly by harnessing the ability of genetic replicates to reduce random noise, as well as within the context of molecular Figure 4 The mean (A) and 95% quantile (B) of location error, the distance in Mb between the detected and simulated QTL, by effect size and number of strains for 1,000 simulations of each setting. The simulations define QTL effect size based on Definition B with an eight allele QTL, and only a single observation per strain. Cells are colored red to white with decreasing mean and blue to white with decreasing 95% quantile. Regularization of the means and 95% quantile was accomplished through averaging the observed results with pseudo-counts; see Figure S3 for the raw measurements. Increasing the number of strains reduces the location error, both in terms of the mean and 95% quantile, more so than QTL effect size, also shown in Figure S6 . The maximum possible location error was 5Mb due to the 10Mb window centered around the true QTL position used for detecting QTL.",

(2014); Orgel et al. (2019) ]. In particular, Figure 5 Heatmap of QTL mapping power by number of replicates and total number of mice in the experiment. Power is based on a QTL effect size of 20%, no background strain effect, and two functional alleles, though varying these parameters does not affect the dynamic between number of strains and replicates. The gray diagonal lines represent fixed values of the number of CC strains, ranging from 10 to 70 in intervals of five. Holding the total number of mice fixed, power is reduced as the percentage of the sample that are replicates is increased. This is illustrated with a cutout band centered on 250 mice, where power is lower at the top of the band when replicate mice are a relatively higher proportion of the total number of mice. Figure 6 The FPR increases due to population structure among the realized genomes of the CC strains in the presence of a background strain effect and no QTL. Curves are based on 10,000 simulations for each setting of strain effect and strain sample, based on a single observation per strain. The inflation in FPR is greater for all 72 CC strains, which includes two closely related cousin strains (CC051 and CC059). Removing CC059 reduces the inflation in FPR (gray line). The dashed red line marks the specified type I error rate of 0.05, which is approximately met as expected when no strain effect is simulated, as in Figure S2 . Table S2 reports the specific FPR values. human genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which often use much larger sample sizes, routinely report QTL with estimated effect sizes far smaller than is detectable in the CC. Nonetheless, there are reasons to expect effect sizes in the CC to be larger than in humans. Human GWASs are observational, and as such include many additional sources of noise, reducing QTL effect sizes relative to what would be possible in more tightly-controlled experimental designs. Experimental populations will also have larger QTL effect sizes because: 1) they typically have more balanced allele frequencies; 2) in the case of panels of RILs, such as the CC, they are homozygous across the genome, which increases the contrast in additive allele effects and thus boosts additive QTL effect size; and 3), again for RILs, they furnish biological replicates, which, as illustrated in Equation 4, can increase effect size by reducing individual error.",

In particular, null simulations that assumed correlated strain effects due to genetic relatedness increased FPR for our mapping approach when the strain effect was large relative to individual error, as would be the case for a highly heritable polygenic trait or when using many replicates.

This has been seen, for example, in cis-regulation of gene expression that largely corresponds to the three subspecies lineages of Mus musculus, present in the CC (Crowley et al. 2015) . Moreover, multi-allelic QTL will not be as powerfully detected through SNP association, as seen, for example, in Aylor et al. (2011) . SNP (or more generally, variant) association also poses additional challenges, such as how to handle regions of the genome (and variants) that are difficult to genotype, as well as the requirement of extensive quality control filtering to remove markers with low minor allele frequencies. These challenges are implicitly reduced in haplotype analysis. Figure 9 The balance of the allelic series for QTL with two functional alleles, and its effect on QTL mapping power. (A) The 127 possible allelic series for a bi-allelic QTL, categorized by the balance in the distribution of alleles among the CC founder strains, and ordered with balanced allelic series at the top and imbalanced at the bottom. (B) Power curves comparing three different sampling approaches for the allelic series with two functional alleles, for populations simulated to have a QTL effect size of 50% in a balanced theoretical population, with a single observation per CC strain. The horizontal red dotted line marks 80% power. The vertical black dashed line marks 58 strains, which is currently the number of unrelated strains available from UNC.",

Though challenging, the development of alternative mapping strategies that specifically account for the allelic series is clearly an imperative methodological advance that would greatly benefit QTL analyses in MPPs with diverse founder alleles. That said, allelic series-aware approaches would likely be computationally expensive and poorly suited to simulation-based power analyses. Meanwhile, in the absence of more sophisticated approaches, the eight allele model, though potentially redundant, has several advantages over SNP association that suggest it will remain a useful (and maybe the default) tool for CC mapping, namely: it encompasses all possible simpler allelic series, implicitly models local epistasis, and, in reflecting the LD decay around detected QTL, more clearly delineates the limits of mapping resolution.",

We have attempted to make re-running the simulations under different settings straightforward for other researchers by developing a software package for this purpose. This package could be used to investigate highly-specialized questions, such as the power for specific combinations of CC strains or assessing how the power to detect QTL varies depending on genomic position.

The QTL mapping procedure estimates separate parameters for each founder, though in reality there are likely fewer functional alleles. We denote the q th functional allele as k q . The allelic series can be sampled and encoded in the M.ID argument within the sim.CC.data() function of SPARCC. Below are examples of allelic series, including balanced (4v4) and unbalanced (7v1) bi-allelic series",
