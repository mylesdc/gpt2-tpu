The study investigated the inhibitory effect and its antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro on TLR7-mediated cytokine production. TLR7 agonist (imiquimod (IMQ)) concentration-dependently induced activation of ISRE-, NF-\u03baB-and AP-1-luciferase reporters, as well as the production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 in human promonocyte cells. However, SARS-CoV PLPro significantly inhibited IMQ-induced cytokine production through suppressing the activation of transcription factors IRF-3, NF-\u03baB and AP-1. Western blot analysis with anti-Lys48 and anti-Lys63 ubiquitin antibodies indicated the SARS-CoV PLPro removed Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6, but not Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains in un-treated and treated cells. The decrease in the activated state of TRAF3 and TRAF6 correlated with the inactivation of TBK1 in response to IMQ by PLPro. The results revealed that the antagonism of SARS-CoV PLPro on TLR7-mediated innate immunity was associated with the negative regulation of TRAF3/6-TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03baB/AP1 signals.",

In the MyD88-dependent pathway, the complex of MyD88 with activated TLR dimers, except for TLR3, recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, then leads IRAK4 to activate other members of the IRAK, like IRAK1 and IRAK2.

Western blot analysis showed a 60-kDa band recombinant PLPro protein in transfected cells, but not controls, as well as the similar expression level of TLR7 in both types of cells ( Figure 1A) , demonstrating that SARS-CoV PLPro was stably expressed in human promonocyte cells that did not alter the TLR7 expression. Quantitative real-time PCR signified TLR7 agonist treatment stimulating higher transcriptional levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in vector controls than in PLPro-expressing cells ( Figure 1B,C) . Western blotting analysis of both of these cells indicated that IRF3 phosphorylation in vector control cells reached a maximum level at 30 min, but disappeared at 60 min after IMQ treatment. Importantly, PLPro inhibited IMQ-induced activation of IRF3 phosphorylation since no significant change in IRF3 phosphorylation was detectable at 30 min after IMQ treatment compared to non-treatment ( Figure 1D ). To assess the functional activity of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induced by TLR7 agonist, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) reporter of the dual-luciferase assay was further performed (Figure 2A ). The TLR7 agonist dose-dependently triggered the ISRE promoter activity in vector control cells, but not in PLPro-expressing cells (Figure 2A ). Quantitative real-time PCR signified that the TLR7 agonist dose-dependently upregulated the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including PKR and IRF7, in vector controls, but not PLPro-expressing cells ( Figure 2B ,C). In addition, TLR7 agonist-induced activation of STAT1 was delayed and suppressed by SARS-CoV PLPro ( Figure 2D ).

The effect of SARS-CoV PLPro on the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP1 promoters, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1) was further characterized via dual-luciferase reporter assay and SYBR green real-time PCR (Figures 3 and  4) . Results indicated that SARS-CoV PLPro inhibits TLR7 agonist-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and AP1 promoters, which was associated with reducing the stimulated upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA ( Figures 3A,B and 4A-C). To explore the inhibitory effect of PLPro on NF-\u03baB and AP1 signals, the levels of NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation were subsequently detected in responses to TLR7 agonist using Western blotting ( Figures 3C and 4D , respectively). Western blotting demonstrated that PLPro suppressed TLR7 agonist-induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK and c-Jun compared to those in the vector control at 30 min post-treatment. The results demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLPro suppressed TLR7-induced cytokines through decreasing the phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun, resulting in suppressing of the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling pathway. . Relative mRNA levels of PKR (B) and IRF7 (C) were normalized by GAPDH mRNA, presented as a relative ratio. In addition, the activated status of STAT1 was examined using Western blot with anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) antibodies (D). * p-Value < 0.05; ** p-value < 0.01 by Student's t-test.",

            "text": "This study proposed TRAF3 and TRAF6 as the crucial regulators of PLPro antagonism via modification of the profiles of ubiquitin-conjugate proteins in the vector control and PLPro-expressing cells; thus, the ubiquitin linkage status of TRAF3 and TRAF6 was analyzed post-treatment with(out) IMQ using immunoprecipitation ( Figure 5 ). Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that PLPro decreased the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6, causing the decrease in the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF3 and TRAF6, which correlated with lower levels of TBK-1 phosphorylation in PLPro-expressing cells than vector control cells in response to IMQ. PLPro has been reported to upregulate the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25k and proteasome subunit alpha type 5, which resulted in the increase of ERK1 poly-ubiquitination in PLPro-expressing cells as the type I IFN antagonistic mechanism of SARS PLPro via the degradation of ERK1 [24, 25] . The high ubiquitination level of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in PLPro-expressing cells ( Figure 5A ,B) might be responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, as demonstrated in our prior reports [24, 25] . The finding was also similar to previous reports in that the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV PLPro on the inactivation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB has been demonstrated to correlate with PLPro-reduced ubiquitination of RIG-I, STING TRAF3, TBK1 and IRF3 in the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways [16, 17] . These previous reports proposed an antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro, including the inhibition of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and STING-TRAF3-TBK1 signaling in the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways. Since TBK1 has been suggested to activate protein phosphatases [26] , no detectable level of IRF3 phosphorylation, as well as the decrease of NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation in the vector control and PLPro-expressing cells at 60 min post-IMQ treatment ( Figures 1D and 3C) could be due to a the negative feedback of the TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03baB pathways. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of TRAF3/6-TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03baB/AP1 signals by PLPro is responsible for the antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro against TLR7-medaited production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

The expression level of PLPro and TLR7 in both stable cell lines was analyzed using Western Blotting with anti-PLPro mouse sera and anti-TLR7 mAb. To monitor the activation of the IMQ-induced TLR7 signaling pathway, PLPro-expressing and vector control cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M IMQ (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) and harvested 0, 30 and 60 min post-treatment. Lysate from IMQ-treated cells was used for the Western blotting assay; the resulting blots were probed with specific primary antibodies against IRF3, phosphor-IRF3, STAT1, phospho-STAT1(Tyr701), NF-\u03baB p65, phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, TBK1, phospho-TBK1, TRAF3, TRAF6 and anti-\u03b2-actin mAb (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

Vector control and PLPro-expressing cells were treated with(out) IMQ for 1 day; cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF3 (A) or anti-TRAF6 (B) followed by Western blotting probed with either anti-Lys48 ubiquitin or anti-Lys63 ubiquitin antibodies. Phospho-TBK1 levels were detected by Western blot (C). The relative band intensity of phospho-TBK1 was normalized by TBK1, compared to the mock vector control cells, and quantified using ImageJ based on triplicate replicates of each experiment (D).",
