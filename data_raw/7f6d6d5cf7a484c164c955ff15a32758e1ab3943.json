These items form the core curriculum and are mostly learned through caring for patients and clinical teaching. Doctorsin-training are evaluated for their knowledge through written tests or assignments, based on which the effectiveness of their training is also assessed; however, this generally produces a negative learning attitude among them. So we introduced the flipped classroom into PGY training program to change PGY students' learning behavior. Although the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom by means of rigorous research methods. Therefore we tried to employed Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980) theory of reasoned action and Bandura's self-efficacy to predict and explain the participants' behavioral intention when participating in the core curriculum learning of the flipped classroom and to assess the change in students' learning behavior and learning effectiveness. From August 2013 to July 2014, 39 PGY students from the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study. The control group included 43 students of the previous year, that is, the year before the intervention of the flipped classroom. A comparative analysis was performed. The questionnaire's related matrices indicated highest correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention (r = 0.491, P < 0.01), followed by attitude (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (r = 0.360, P < 0.01.) All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached significance level. The flipped classroom can indeed change PGY students' the learning behavior from \"passive learning\" to \"active learning.\" PLOS ONE |",

With newer developments in digital technology in the 21st century, the classroom teaching skills have become increasingly significant in the education. The continuous innovations in various kinds of digital technology have rendered the current teaching methods much more diverse than those of the past. Teaching methods have undergone immense changes. The \"flipped classroom\" method that has been widely discussed in recent years is a new teaching method that has attracted the attention of educators worldwide. As its name suggests, the core concept of the flipped classroom is to \"flip\" the teaching model; it aims to change the traditional teaching model, in which \"teachers teach the content of the curriculum while students discuss and practice after lessons and then complete assignments,\" to a newer way of attending class, in which \"students watch videos of the curriculum content prepared by their teachers for them, engage in discussions and practices in class, and then complete their assignments\" [5] . In both European and American teachers' networks, the flipped classroom has been one of the most fervently searched keywords in the past few years and has been implemented in many classrooms today because the maturity of modern science and technology has made the production of teaching videos remarkably easy [6, 7] . In addition, there are already significant video resources on YouTube or other websites that can be utilized. Secondary school teachers have proposed an idea that calls for allowing students to watch the teaching videos at home and using class time for exercises, experiments, group discussions, asking questions, summarizing main points, or other in-depth learning activities [8] .",

To confirm students' learning outcomes, we specially designed a core curriculum that suited the flipped classroom model; students were required to analyze the cases, integrate information, and apply their knowledge in class while teachers observed their reactions and provided reinforcement and individual guidance. Through this model, we hope to truly attain our goals of cultivating new doctors with independent thinking and independent practice skills, and thus improve the quality of medical services and ensure patients' safety.",

Through continuous development and verification, Fishbein and Ajzen proposed the notion of subjective norms and constructed a complete framework of the four in 1980 [10, 11] . Thus, the theory of reasoned action maintains that behavioral intention, the decisive factor directly affecting an individual's actions, will be influenced by \"attitude\" and \"subjective norms.\" As for the behavioral influence produced by other factors, they can all indirectly influence behavior through behavioral intention. Therefore, when an individual's attitude toward behavior is more positive, his behavioral intention will be higher and when his attitude toward behavior is more negative, his behavioral intention will be lower.",

The correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention was the highest (r = .491, P < .01), followed by attitude (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (r = 0.360, P < 0.01). All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached the significance level (Table 4 ).",

Thus, the theory of reasoned action has two hypotheses: 1. most human behaviors are under their own volitional Table 6 . Differences in the students with respect to knowledge, skills, and attitude before and after the intervention of the learning of the core curriculum through the flipped classroom. control and also in accordance with reason and 2. the behavioral intention that determines whether or not humans perform a certain behavior is the immediate determinant of the occurrence or non-occurrence of that behavior. Self-efficacy is also an important variable in changing and maintaining behavior. It is one of the core concepts of Bandura's social learning theory [10, 11] . Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in his/her ability to perform a specific behavior in a specific situation; it can serve as a predictive variable when explaining the individual's extent of behavior. The source of this predictive variable varies in its performance level and strength according to the variables of cognition, sociality, and environments, thus resulting in different behavioral outcomes.",

Walvoord and Anderson adopted the assignment-based model, which requires students to write a few questions before class to get feedback for the same in class [30] . Besides this, online interaction, key notes, and problems-recording are all possible methods. If students have not utilized their time before class to better understand and remember teaching contents, it indicates that they have not fulfilled their responsibility; attending class without learning the required knowledge will render in-class group assignments and activities ineffective. In other words, such a student can hardly become an independent and autonomous learner. The real strength of education lies in teaching students to engage in active inquiry and learning rather than the videos; students, in learning independently, must simultaneously be able to search the materials they need and critically review them. The core duty of the flipped classroom is developing a student-centered teaching method, thus the students will control and possess their own learning.",
