HAdV pneumonia infected recruit trainees most frequently. High and prolonged fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, and pharyngeal inflammation were significantly more common in the HAdV pneumonia group, compared to patients with other or unknown causes of pneumonia. Only 12% of HAdV pneumonia patients displayed leukocytosis, whereas febrile leukopenia (62.7%) and thrombocytopenia (41%) were commonly observed. HAdV pneumonia patient chest CT scans displayed ground glass opacity (with or without septal thickness) with consolidation in 50.0% of patients.",

There are many reports of respiratory virus outbreaks in the military [1] [2] [3] . In many settings, human adenovirus (HAdV) was the main causative pathogen and occasionally led to death [3, 4] . HAdVs are also important in the pathogenesis of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals [5, 6] . Although despite reports of a low prevalence in previous studies (1.4-4%), adenovirus-related CAP was recently ranked in the top 10 etiologies of CAP by larger studies [7, 8] . Moreover, HAdV is easily transmittable and can be highly contagious [9] . The clinical features of respiratory adenoviral infection among military personnel were described previously; however, HAdV pneumonia in immunocompetent individuals and risk factors of disease progression to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure have not been well studied.",

It is well documented that the most significant factor leading to HAdV infection and disease is a lack of preexisting, type-specific immunity against HAdV-4 and HAdV-7. Moreover, anti-HAdV4 immunity provided 60% protection from adenovirus-related hospitalization and 98% protection from infection [1, 25] . In the Korean military, it is not certain why active duty service personnel were infected less frequently than trainees. One possibility is that the former group may have had preexisting HAdV-55 antibodies from previous exposure. Another possibility is that the former group had other cross-protective HAdV antibodies. In 2006, HAdV-7 was the dominant type of HAdV in the Korea military [26] . HAdV-7 is in the same species group as HAdV-55 (HAdV-7/11/14/55 are in species group B) [27] . When a HAdV-14 outbreak occurred at U.S. military training facilities, preexisting HAdV-7 neutralizing antibodies provided cross-protection against HAdV-14 in recruits [28] . Other predisposing factors that might be associated with selective infection of newly recruited trainees include overcrowding and physical or emotional stress [29, 30] .",

One possible reason for this timing pattern is that sufficient numbers of infected or colonized trainees may be required to cause an outbreak [28] .

Although the mean fever duration in HAdV pneumonia patients was similar to those in previous studies (6-9 days) [21, 31, 32] , patients with HAdV pneumonia had higher and longer fevers than the HAdV-negative group. Moreover, the fever duration associated with severe HAdV pneumonia was prolonged relative to that of mild-moderate pneumonia, again corroborating previous reports [32] . Patients with HAdV pneumonia also had more upper respiratory tract symptoms than those in the negative group, suggesting that HAdV infected or colonized the upper respiratory tract first, then progressed to a lower respiratory tract infection. The most typical laboratory findings of HAdV pneumonia were febrile leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. In agreement with our results, Vento et al. [33] demonstrated lower WBC and platelet counts in a HAdV-14 pneumonia among U.S. military trainees. Patients with severe pneumonia had fewer WBC and lower platelet counts than those with mild to moderate pneumonia. Moreover, the mean times from fever onset to the nadir of WBC and to the greatest radiologic aggravation were similar and correlated (r = 0.513, p <0.001). These findings suggest that hematologic parameters might be used to monitor HAdV pneumonia and to index risk factors for disease progression. Finally, although the CRP levels were moderately elevated in our study, the mean procalcitonin level was only 0.35 \u03bcg/L, confirming that a bacterial infection was unlikely [34] . In fact, bacterial coinfection was rare. Among the 153/191 adenovirus-positive patients, only 3.9% (6/153) exhibited evidence of bacterial infection (typical: 1; atypical: 5). In contrast, among the 38/191 adenovirus-negative patients, 47.4% (18/38) had bacterial infections (p <0.001). This further confirms the HAdV infection findings in our cohort.",

The most common pattern in our study was GGO with or without septal thickness and central consolidation, a finding specific to HAdV pneumonia that was not observed with HAdV-negative pneumonia. Our CT scans also demonstrated that single lobe involvement was more common than multi-lobe involvement, in contrast to a previous case report that suggested such cases usually manifested as bilateral involvement [35] . These observations might be useful during the differential diagnosis of young adults presenting with pneumonia symptoms during an outbreak; however, further radiological studies are needed.",

However, Kim et al. [23] , in another study of severe HAdV infection in the Korean military, suggested that early treatment with cidofovir should be considered for respiratory failure due to HAdV pneumonia. Most patients in our study were treated empirically with antibiotics, and most HAdV pneumonia cases were self-limiting without an antiviral agent. However, cidofovir was administered at a 5-mg/kg weekly dose to two severe HAdV pneumonia patients. One patient recovered without sequelae, whereas the other patient died. It would be unsafe to offer cidofovir to all HAdV pneumonia patients because of the risk of renal toxicity. Moreover, this drug is expensive and is not stocked regularly in hospitals. In this respect, the early identification of patients who might develop severe pneumonia is most important when selecting cases that will receive antiviral treatment [23] . Interestingly, the PSI scores and CURB-65 values were higher in the severe pneumonia group, whereas the absolute scores in this group did not indicate high risk. Notably, age is an important factor in these pneumonia severity score systems; accordingly, the lower scores obtained in our study might be partly attributable to the young ages of our adult patients. In addition, that these scoring systems were validated in communities where the main pathogens were bacterial, rather than viral [36] . Similar results were observed in pandemic H1N1 influenza pneumonia studies in which PSI and CURB-65 failed to predict admissions to intensive care or the need for mechanical ventilation [37, 38] .",
