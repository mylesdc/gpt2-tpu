Methods: Employing a statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented. Results: Assuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7-36.7). Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8-49.0). Conclusion: The present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings. The estimate of about 30% was consistent with those derived from volunteer challenge studies. Practical difficulty in controlling GII.4 outbreaks was supported by the data, considering that a large estimate of the asymptomatic ratio was obtained for the GII.4 genotype.",

            "text": "Noroviruses are an evolutionarily diverse group of singlestranded positive-sense RNA viruses without the envelope, belonging to the Caliciviridae family, and are responsible for a substantial part of acute viral gastroenteritis in humans. 1, 2 Norovirus outbreaks have happened both in developing and industrialized nations. 3 Once infected, symptoms are characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal cramps, and there has been no specific treatment to accelerate the cure of patients infected with the virus. 4 Vaccines have yet to be fully developed and brought into practice, 5 and the presence of various genotypes prevents infected human from acquiring sufficient specific immunity. 6 Published studies have reported that around 30% of norovirus infection remains asymptomatic, 7 while such asymptomatically infected individuals are known to excrete substantial volume of viruses. 8, 9 Vomit from infectious individuals contains over 10 7 copies=gram of noroviruses, 8, 9 and infectious vomitus is known to be sometimes aerosolized, 10, 11 making it difficult to prevent secondary transmissions. The virus spreads through fecal-oral routes, such as via contaminated water, food, and people's contaminated hands. 12, 13 Published studies indicate that infections associated with environmental contaminants are mainly caused by contaminated water or foods (especially oysters), 11 accounting for seasonal outbreaks that are frequently observed in winter. 14 Given these features, workers who are directly engaged in cooking and handling of foods, such as cooks, food servers, and food factory workers, are considered as one of the key subjects for prevention of secondary transmissions. [15] [16] [17] One of the notable virological features of noroviruses is genotype variation, which is divided into five genogroups and many genotypes in each genogroup. 18 As of 2017, the most prevalent genotype in humans is GII. 4, 19, 20 which accounts for as many as 80% of all reported norovirus infections with virus isolation. 21 Some pieces of evidence indicate that this genotype evolves rapidly, escaping from selection pressure. 22, 23 In Japan, the majority of outbreaks are caused by genogroup II, and a large proportion is caused by GII.4. 24 GII.4-associated epidemics in Japan were first observed in 2006, and the genotype has been continuously observed every year since then. 25 To decipher the most effective preventive measures against this virus, it is vital to quantitatively clarify the natural history characteristics, including asymptomatic ratio, the risk of infection per exposure, and the probability of virus shedding. Nevertheless, explicit estimates are very scarce, except for rigorous challenge studies that helped quantify the natural history 5, 26 ; moreover, it is unclear if the natural history of experimentally infected individuals are similar to those based on natural infection. A small number of mathematical modelling studies estimated a part of the abovementioned values, 27-30 but explicit model-based estimates of the asymptomatic ratio have yet to be offered. The present study aims to estimate the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, reanalyzing foodborne outbreak data with laboratory testing in Japan, along with other parameters, including virus shedding frequency and the risk of infection. In addition to estimating the asymptomatic ratio for all noroviruses, the present study also compares the estimate across different genogroups and genotypes.",

Asymptomatic individuals were defined as persons without diarrhea and vomiting, and the asymptomatic ratio was defined as the proportion of asymptomatically infected individuals among the total of infected individuals. Through stool specimen tests using highly sensitive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which has the highest detection limit among all existing genome testing methods 32 the virus and its genogroup=genotype were identified. Due to its highly sensitive nature, the real-time RT-PCR was shown to detect positive norovirus specimens if >10 copies were included in a well. 32 Since asymptomatic healthy individuals as well as symptomatic cases were tested, the results in each outbreak are classified into four categories, ie, (i) symptomatic and virus positive, (ii) symptomatic but virus negative, (iii) asymptomatic and virus positive, and (iv) asymptomatic and virus negative. In addition to the number of people in each category for each outbreak, genotyping results were obtained. Figure 1 summarizes the survey results, and the coded data are given in eTable 1. It should be noted that the number of asymptomatic and virusnegative individuals includes both uninfected individuals and infected cases without virus shedding. The abovementioned study 31 has been very rigorous, in that all individuals involved in each food-borne outbreak were fully surveyed, which has been extremely rare and not routinely attainable. In addition, such a study must employ the highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR, a condition that was also satisfied by the 2005-2006 study. 31 Moreover, all events were observed in the same year in Japan within food handling facilities of comparable sizes.",

In addition to original findings of similar virus shedding frequency inducing asymptomatic infections among food handlers. Not only spreading the virus via food handlers, but the greater asymptomatic ratio allows infected individuals to be freely mobile and have more opportunities to pass the virus to others. When we assumed that the actual frequency of virus shedding from asymptomatic individuals is smaller than symptomatic cases, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be greater than the baseline. In other words, the estimated value around 30% might be even greater than our result. There was no statistically significant difference between GI and GII, while the AIC value was indicative that there might be a difference between GI and GII. This was caused by limited sample size, and slight non-significant differences (eg, greater risk of infection for GI than GII and smaller asymptomatic ratio for GI than GII) were identified, implying that GI might be more controllable than GII. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to epidemiologically endorse different patterns of outbreaks by genogroups in natural settings, though differences have been indicated in experimental studies. 12, 22, 23 While a greater asymptomatic ratio for GII.4 than others was consistent with our existing understanding, the smaller infection risk with GII.4 than others calls for careful interpretation. Due to the frequent circulation of GII.4, a portion of exposed individuals might have been immune in advance of outbreaks (that were not widespread before 2006 but may have remained unrecognized); moreover, evolutionary changes in GII.4 (eg, antigenic evolution) might have later varied the virus characteristics, including the infectiousness of GII.4. Evolutionary epidemiological study of GII.4 to be adapted to human populations is a subject of our ongoing study.",

That is, to define symptomatic cases, diarrhea or vomiting was employed, but they were qualitative definitions that did not explicitly involve the frequency, such as the number of defecations=vomiting per day. Such qualitative definition is favored for clearly defining what a symptomatic case is, and an important advantage of the present study is that an identical research group has conducted the entire survey and minimized the measurement of error that could potentially arise from researchers. Nevertheless, when it comes to additionally measuring the severity of illness, which is out of the scope of the present study, it might have been unavoidable to include human perception error. Such misclassification could have potentially affected the asymptomatic ratio (eg, due to broad definition of asymptomatic persons). Moreover, the exact timing of stool sampling was unavailable; however, it is likely that all sampling took place in a matter of 1 week from the onset of outbreaks, during which the virus shedding level of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases should be substantial. 8 Second, the model involved a few simplifications. The simplified points include the ignorance of the dependent happening in the risk of infection. Since the majority of outbreaks were considered as purely foodborne, a single parameter p was allocated, but if human-to-human transmission was involved, it might have been better to account for that information, which was not attainable in the present study using the same dataset. Another simplification was the use of binomial sampling process for each likelihood. As a consequence, the uncertainty bound of p in the present study should be regarded as an underestimate. One of the drawbacks has been seen in significantly greater p that we obtained when two big outbreaks were removed from analysis; in other words, the estimate might not have been significantly different if the uncertainty also reflected demographic stochasticity.",
