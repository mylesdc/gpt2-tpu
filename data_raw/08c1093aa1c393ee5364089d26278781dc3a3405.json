RNA viruses have compact multifunctional genomes that frequently contain overlapping genes and non-coding functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences. Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements. Having previously tested this technique by experimental verification of discoveries in selected viruses, we now analyze sequence alignments for \u223c700 RNA virus species to identify hundreds of such regions, many of which have not been previously described.",

Such viruses include influenza A virus (IAV), Ebola virus, rabies virus, SARS virus, MERS virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and Lassa virus. Many other human pathogenic viruses are RNA viruses, including poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), rubella virus, chikungunya virus, Norwalk virus, mumps virus and measles virus. RNA viruses also include important pathogens of livestock, such as bluetongue virus, foot and mouth disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Schmallenberg virus. Further, the majority of plant viruses are RNA viruses. The combined impact of RNA viruses--economically and in terms of human suffering--is immense.",

Many of the most important RNA viruses were amongst the first genomes to be sequenced, some 30 years ago. Surprisingly, however, 'hidden' protein-coding genes are still being discovered even in the most well-studied and economically important RNA viruses including the potyviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, arteriviruses and IAV (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Such genes tend to be very short, often overlap other genes (in an alternative reading frame) and are often expressed via non-canonical translational mechanisms. These features make such genes difficult to identify using conventional bioinformatic or experimental approaches. Current knowledge of non-coding functional elements in RNA virus genomes (e.g. essential replicational, translational and packaging signals) is also far from complete. While such elements have been reasonably well mapped in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of genomes of the most important RNA viruses, RNA virus genomes frequently contain additional non-coding functional elements embedded within the protein-coding regions.",

Systematic synonymous-site mutational analyses (7, 8) are resource-intensive and can miss functional elements that are only required in vivo. High-throughput RNA-structure probing techniques such as SHAPE (selective 2 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) (9) (10) (11) and Structure-seq (in vivo dimethyl sulphate methylation of unpaired adenine and cytosine residues) (12, 13) are often unable to distinguish functionally important RNA elements from incidental features, unless combined with comparative information (e.g. parallel analysis of divergent virus strains). Highthroughput translational profiling techniques such as ribosome profiling (14, 15) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (16, 17) --while extremely powerful--again cannot always distinguish between functional products, regulatory translation (e.g. where translation of small upstream open reading frames, or uORFs, simply modulates translation of downstream protein-coding ORFs) and translational noise. Meanwhile, poorly translated but nonetheless functionally relevant products may be overlooked. Further, high-throughput experimental techniques have only been applied to a few select species and it is impractical to examine all of the hundreds of medically, veterinarily and agriculturally relevant virus species in this way both due to cost and the different complexities of each virus system.",

This potential has been realized most thoroughly for the human genome. In contrast, far less work has been done on applying comparative genomic techniques to virus genomes (18) . This is surprising because many viruses--particularly RNA viruses--are uniquely amenable to comparative genomic analysis. RNA viruses have very small genomes (2-32 kb) , and many are of medical or economic importance, both factors which have led to the accumulation of large numbers of sequenced isolates for many species. Furthermore, RNA viruses evolve extremely rapidly so that, even within a single species, different strains often diverge by 10-30% at the nucleotide level. By studying the patterns of substitutions in large numbers of sequences from a single virus species, or groups of related virus species, it is often possible to predict novel functional elements and gain considerable insight into their function. Where resources are limited, comparative computational analyses can be used to efficiently target experimental analysis. In contrast with many high-throughput experimental approaches, comparative genomics allows the direct detection of purifying selection which, to a very large extent, is synonymous with functional importance (19) .",

Previously, we developed a novel algorithm, herein named synplot2, for this analysis (23, 24) . Unlike most earlier work, synplot2 simultaneously takes into account phylogeny, calculates statistical significance and does not require a training set. Previously, we have tested this technique by experimentally verifying a number of new features discovered using synplot2. These include the +1 frameshift PA-X gene in IAV (6), the -2 frameshift nsp2TF gene in arteriviruses (5), the -1 frameshift NS1' gene in Japanese encephalitis virus and related flaviviruses (3, 23) , the -1 frameshift 2B* gene in Encephalomyocarditis virus (25) , an extended stem-loop structure that stimulates programmed stop codon readthrough in alphaviruses (24) , the 5a gene in arteriviruses (4), the non-AUG initiated Px gene in sobemoviruses (26) , an unexpected subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) for capsid protein expression in Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (27) and an essential RNA element in HEV (28) .",

Comparative genomic analysis can aid identification of the correct frameshift site as frameshift sites are generally highly conserved between related species. Based on this and the literature, we annotated sites of known or predicted influenza-PAX-like +1 frameshifting in IAV, fijiviruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus and related viruses and amalgamaviruses according to (33) . Programmed +1 frameshifting in closterovirids was assumed to involve P-site slippage on the GUU U of a GUU stop C sequence that is highly conserved at the ORF1 stop codon in most closterovirids (31, 34) . In ampeloviruses (family Closteroviridae) that lack this motif, +1 P-site slippage was assumed to occur on the UUU C of a slightly upstream UUU CGA sequence (PAX-like) that is conserved in many other ampelovirus sequences. Finally in Citrus tristeza closterovirus, where ORF1 is extended some 25 codons relative to other closteroviruses, +1 frameshifting was assumed to occur on the GUU C of a GUU CGG sequence that aligns to the GUU stop in other closteroviruses (35) . In Leishmania RNA virus 1, +1 frameshifting is assumed but the site remains unknown.

Initial multiple sequence alignments (see below) were analyzed with the genefinding program MLOGD (1, 30) to identify unannotated coding ORFs, particularly in regions previously assumed to be non-coding (e.g. non-AUG initiated upstream ORFs). MLOGD was originally developed to predict novel overlapping genes, but, in most cases, we find it to be less sensitive for this purpose than synplot2. However, MLOGD can also be used to annotate non-overlapping or partially overlapping genes. In this usage, MLOGD is conceptually similar to the Ka/Ks statistic (ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions). A small number of additional potential coding ORFs were identified based simply on the presence of a long ORF (statistical significance assessed via sequence shuffling methods similar to those described in (5)) with a plausible translation mechanism. These additional potential coding ORFs were then added to the coding sequence annotations to increase the regions accessible for synplot2 analysis (which is only applicable to the proteincoding regions of a virus genome). Note that, while important for completing the annotation of less-well studied and poorly annotated virus species, predicted coding ORFs (except ones that had been previously experimentally confirmed) were not used to evaluate synplot2 performance.",

We chose 75% amino acid identity as the default cut-off so as to be able to detect features specific to single species or clades of closely related species, and also so that automated genome-wide alignments could be produced that mostly maintained the reading frame within coding regions. Maintenance of reading frame within coding regions is important for codon-based evolutionary analyses such as synplot2 and MLOGD. We used the alignment program code2aln version 1.2 (38) , which uses both nucleotide and codon scoring metrics, to aid the generation of codonrespecting alignments. Nonetheless, insertion/deletion mutations and/or sequencing errors do occasionally lead to local shifts in reading-frame between different isolates. Thus, in each sequence, we masked regions that aligned locally out of frame with the RefSeq so that they could be excluded from the synplot2 and MLOGD analyses. Potential insertion/deletion sequencing errors in RefSeqs (e.g. where the RefSeq has a region that is locally out of frame with respect to all other sequenced isolates) were also flagged in this way. Using code2aln, sequences were aligned one by one with the RefSeq, and positions in each pairwise alignment that contained a gap character in the RefSeq were excluded. In this way, we built up a multiple sequence alignment mapped to the RefSeq genomic coordinates (if there were >200 full-length sequences, we chose 200 sequences at random; after subsequently removing duplicate sequences this typically resulted in alignments of slightly fewer than 200 sequences). The rationale for mapping sequences onto RefSeq coordinates is so that the coding sequence annotation can be defined by the RefSeq (amongst other things, making the analysis less susceptible to insertion/deletion sequencing errors in the non-reference sequences). The non-reference sequences may be thought of as informing a comparativegenomic annotation of the RefSeq.",

Where coding sequences overlap, the reading frame corresponding to the longest of multiple overlapping ORFs was used to define synonymous codons for the synplot2 analysis. Since analysis of a genome with a sliding window involves multiple tests, a basic threshold of 0.05 / (length of coding region / window size) was annotated on plots for individual virus genomes. This is an approximate Bonferroni-like correction so that, for a given virus genome, there is an \u223c5% probability that one or more regions evolving neutrally at synonymous sites would by chance register a signal beyond this threshold. To correct for multiple testing across the \u223c1300 individual alignments analyzed (including separate segment alignments for viruses with multipartite genomes), more stringent criteria were required. Around half of the alignments have sufficiently low sequence divergence that it is not possible for them to register significant (post Bonferroni correction) P-values, even in regions of 100% synonymous-site conservation, and such alignments should not contribute to a correction for multiple testing. We used a P-value threshold of 10 \u22126 (25-codon window size) for selecting the conserved regions reported in Supplementary Dataset S1. We chose this threshold because, summed over the alignments, there are \u223c46 000 nonoverlapping 25-codon windows coming from alignments with sufficient sequence divergence that 100% synonymoussite conservation in a 25-codon window would register a Pvalue of 10 \u22126 or lower, giving rise to an expected probability of 46 000 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , i.e. \u223c5% of obtaining a single false positive over the analysis of all alignments.

The lower panel (obs/exp) indicates the relative amount of synonymous-site variability as represented by the ratio of the observed number of synonymous substitutions to the expected number, in a 15-codon sliding window. The upper panel shows the corresponding P-value (note that P-values cannot be compared directly between plots as larger and more diverse alignments provide more statistical power). The dashed line represents a P-value of 0.05 / (polyprotein length / window size)--an approximate Bonferroni-like correction for multiple testing; i.e. there is an \u223c5% probability that one or more regions evolving neutrally at synonymous sites could by chance register a signal above the dashed line. Functional non-coding RNA elements embedded within the polyprotein-coding sequence--namely the cre, the RNaseL ciRNA (two components) and the \u2423/3D-7000 and \u2424 elements (see main text)--are labelled and the corresponding sequence regions are indicated below the Pvalue plot.

The polymerase skipping occurs at transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs) positioned upstream of ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 ('+'s in Figure 3 ). Although the TRSs themselves comprise just a few nucleotides (UAACC or closely related sequences in PRRSV), synplot2 revealed regions of reduced synonymous-site variability at or just upstream of most TRS sites. The analysis of TuMV clearly revealed the overlapping pipo ORF (1) but also revealed extensive regions of reduced variability at synonymous sites at the 5' and 3' ends of the polyprotein-coding sequence (some of the latter may correspond to functional elements previously identified in related potyviruses) (51, 52) . Finally the analysis of IAV revealed, as observed previously using different methods (22), reduced synonymous-site variability in regions towards the termini of most segments which is thought to correspond to packaging signals, in a central region of the M1 ORF in segment 7, and in the dual-coding regions where the NS1 and NEP ORFs overlap, and where the PA and X ORFs overlap. In accordance with previous comments (53) we observed relatively weak purifying selection on the overlapping PB1-F2 ORF (54) in pan-IAV alignments. As external objective test sets, we used a list of experimentally verified overlapping genes in RNA viruses from (55) and a list of experimentally characterized overlapping non-coding elements from (40) . To detected overlapping genes we used a sliding window size of 45 codons, while to detect overlapping non-coding elements--which are often much smaller features--we used a sliding window size of 15 codons. A highly conservative threshold of P \u2264 10 \u22126 (designed to allow approximately one false positive over an analysis of all RNA virus genomes; see Materials and Methods) was used to designate features as 'detected'. For each feature, we selected a well-sequenced representative virus species containing the feature. Features for which all of the relevant species-based alignments lacked sufficient diversity to allow synplot2 to detect even a 60% reduction in synonymous-site variability (i.e. obs/exp = 0.4) at P \u2264 10 \u22126 in a window of the given size were not used, as the purpose of the exercise was to determine whether there are known features that synplot2 fails to detect even when provided with sufficient sequence diversity. (Note that the threshold for discarding low diversity alignments is a mean-overgenome statistic and may not correspond precisely to the P-value for obs/exp = 0.4 in a specific window.) Synplot2 detected 20/21 overlapping genes (Table 1 ) and 16/17 overlapping non-coding features ( Table 2 ). The nondetections (i.e. P > 10 \u22126 ) comprised the overlapping VP5 gene in Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (genus Aquabirnavirus) which appears to be subject to relatively weak purifying selection (high obs/exp relative to other dual-coding regions; Table 1 ), and the cardiovirus cre where the P-value (3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) was just above threshold. Thus, given sufficient sequencing depth, synplot2 appears to easily discover most known functional elements embedded within RNA virus coding sequences.",

In between these two extremes, syn-plot2 can produce useful results even with just two sequences. Figure 6c shows an example of synplot2 applied to an alignment of just two divergent HEV isolates--the Gen-Bank RefSeq NC 001434.1 and GenBank accession number AB161718.1 (83% amino acid identity, 75% nucleotide identity, in the coding regions), using a 75-codon sliding window.

This provided a range of alignment divergences ranging from 0.08 to 6.85 nucleotide substitutions per site over the phylogenetic tree. For each alignment, we calculated the mean P-value across the alignment that would be achieved for various levels of reduced synonymous-site variability (i.e. obs/exp), and for a range of sliding window sizes (Figure 7) . The P-value for a sliding window of size 9 codons and obs/exp = 0.7 represents the ability of synplot2 to detect an overlapping feature that leads to a 30% decrease in synonymous-site variability in a 9-codon window. As can be seen from Figures 1-6 and Tables 1 and 2, both overlapping genes and overlapping noncoding elements are frequently associated with >50% reductions in synonymous-site variability. For typical one-off analyses (e.g. P-value threshold of 0.05 with multiple testing corrections based on a single HEV-sized genome), an alignment divergence of \u223c0.25 may be sufficient to identify features of size \u226545 codons, such as many overlapping genes (Figure 7, panel 5) . For non-coding elements, smaller win-dow sizes (e.g. 7-25 codons) are generally more appropriate. For a 15-codon sliding window, an alignment divergence of \u223c0.85 may be sufficient to identify overlapping features (Figure 7, panel 3) . Window sizes of 5 codons are only useful for the most highly sequenced species such as HEV, but are becoming accessible for more species as sequence databases continue to grow. Functional elements even smaller than 5 codons may be detected within 5-codon windows given sufficient reduction in synonymous-site variability, but window sizes smaller than 5 codons are best avoided due to fluctuations in sensitivity as a result of different levels of codon degeneracy (e.g. conserved columns of AUG Met or UGG Trp codons provide no synonymous site variation signal).",

Alignments containing recombinants typically contain regions where variability (both synonymous and non-synonymous) is reduced relative to the genome average. Potentially this can be problematic for the synplot2 analysis, where the divergence parameters and phylogenetic tree are assumed to be constant for the whole region analyzed. In the work presented here, we have not checked for nor removed recombinants as we have only rarely found recombination to be a significant issue for synplot2 analyses. Recombination tends to result in distinctive plateaux in the synplot2 P-value plots (an example is purposefully included in Figure 1 ) allowing problematic cases to be identified and reanalysed with recombinants excluded. Alternatively, standard recombination software can be used to prescreen alignments for recombinants (57) . A complementary strategy is to generate alignments for the coding regions of individual proteins (or separate regions of polyproteins) as fixed recombinations occur much more frequently between than within protein-coding domains. We have found syn-plot2 to be quite effective on alignments as short as 100 codons in length.",

We frequently observed conservation in places expected for -1 frameshift stimulatory elements (e.g. Figure 3 ; Supplementary Figures S1 .1, S1.6, S6.1) (31,59), readthrough stimulatory elements (e.g. Figure 2 ; Supplementary Figures S2.2 (62) (63) (64) (65) . Other conserved regions associated with known internal elements were also observed. Examples include the picornavirus cre element, whose location in the genome varies between different picornavirid species (Supplementary Figures S4.1, S4.2, S4.3 The 192-sequence alignment was arbitrarily split into three 64-sequence alignments, and each alignment was analyzed separately (red, blue, green lines). All three alignments produce similar results. Note that a plot similar to (a), but based on a different sequence alignment, has been published previously (28) . Figure S5.6) . Each of these conserved regions coincides with a nearly conserved absence of stop codons in an alternative reading frame (+2 frame relative to the main coding ORF for the orthoreovirus and +1 frame for the other two), and may therefore indicate a novel overlapping coding ORF. In all three cases there is a suitable conserved AUG codon for AUG-initiated translation of the overlapping ORF. However the strong context of the AUG initiation codon of the main ORF, besides additional AUG codons in some sequences upstream of the AUG codon of the overlapping ORF, would be expected to inhibit leaky scanning, thus making the translational mechanism for these three potential novel ORFs uncertain. Further, the conservation signal in Bluetongue virus might also be compatible with a -1 frameshift to access a shorter overlapping ORF in the -1/+2 reading frame. Alternatively these conserved regions may represent novel non-coding elements.",

Reduced synonymous-site variability was observed at the 5' end of the coding regions of some bunyavirid genome segments (e.g. Supplementary Figures S14.1 and S14.2), and at both ends of orthomyxovirus genome segments (e.g. Figure 5 ), likely corresponding to sorting and packaging signals. However, most regions of reduced synonymous-site variability corresponded to regions of gene overlap--e.g. in orthomyxoviruses (e.g. Figure 5 ), bunyavirids (segment S) (e.g. Supplementary  Figures S14.1 and S14. 2), paramyxoviruses (e.g. Supplementary Figures S16.1, S16.2, S16.3, S16. The apparent paucity of RNA structural elements may be due to a characteristic of negative-sense RNA virus replication, namely that the genomic and antigenomic RNAs are always found bound to multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein (81), thus reducing their capacity to engage in RNA:RNA interactions. Indeed, although terminal sequences base-pair in bunyavirids (82, 83) , and stem-loop structures may play roles in transcription termination and translation (84, 85) , extensive RNA structure has been found to be generally lacking in negative-sense RNA viruses (86) . For generic identification of regions of reduced synonymous-site variability, we identified codon positions in alignments where the synplot2 P-value for a 25-codon window centred on that codon position was \u2264 10 \u22126 . For very large and diverse alignments, P-values can become significant even for fairly modest reductions in synonymous-site variability; so, in order to focus only on regions with strong purifying selection (a proxy for the degree of functional importance), we further selected only codon positions where the ratio of the observed number to the expected number of synonymous substitutions in the 25-codon window was \u2264 0.65. Adjacent codon positions satisfying these conditions were merged into regions, and adjacent regions were merged if the gap between them was \u2264 24 codons (the rationale for this is that each selected codon position actually represents the midpoint of a 25-codon window). More than 700 such regions of low synonymous-site variability are listed in Supplementary Dataset S1.",

Example workflow for synplot2 analysis. The synplot2 analysis requires a codon-based multiple sequence alignment and a single parameter, the sliding window size. Maximum signal for a specific feature will be achieved when the window size is equal to the size of the feature. A window size of 45 codons works well for many overlapping genes. Functional RNA structural elements often fall in the range 7-25 codons; however window sizes below \u223c9-13 codons can produce noisy results and are best avoided except for the most highly sequenced species; a window size of 15 codons works well for many cases. Functional primary sequence elements (for example paramyxovirid transcriptional slippage sites, PAX-like +1 frameshift sites, protein binding sites and nidoviralid TRSs) are often <5 codons and might escape detection, though they are often associated with other features (overlapping genes in the first two cases, potential regulatory sequences in the last) that may be detected. the presence of an overlapping coding sequence. Alternatively, inspection with RNA folding software such as the alignment-based methods in the ViennaRNA package (100) can reveal the presence of compensatory substitutions (i.e. paired substitutions that preserve predicted base-pairings) that can indicate the presence of a functional RNA structural element. An example workflow is illustrated in Figure 8 . Given sufficient alignment depth and divergence, these signals may be unambiguous. In other cases they can still provide predictions for experimental investigation.",

For these viruses, syn-plot2 can be used on single-species alignments to identify even species-specific features. Where within-species data is limited, one may use alignments of sequences from related species to identify features conserved at that taxonomic level or higher. Limitations arise from very compact features, limited divergence among available sequences and features subject to relatively weak purifying selection, including newly evolving features perhaps present in only some strains of a virus species (101) . Future work will focus on extending the analyses to retroviruses and RNA virus species without designated NCBI RefSeqs, and developing the user interface to the database to allow blast querying and on-the-fly sequence selection and alignment generation for user query sequences.",

The identification of previously overlooked functional elements will advance fundamental molecular virological research. It also has the potential to resolve previous enigmatic results--e.g. where disruption of undetected overlapping features has confounded mutational analyses of the genes they overlap. By providing a reference map of functional elements embedded within virus protein-coding sequences, synplot2 is relevant to the strategy of using large-scale codon-deoptimization to create attenuated live virus vaccines which cannot easily revert to wild type (102) , since this strategy can only work if essential replicational elements are excluded from the codon-deoptimization. Similarly, knowing and understanding all of the essential functional elements is important for the rational design of virus-based gene expression vectors (e.g. for cancer therapy and vaccination).",

Conserved regions at or near the 5' and/or 3' ends of the genomic coding regions were observed in many taxa, including potyviruses (Supplementary Figures S8.1 and S8.4), nepoviruses (SupplementaryFigure S9.3), fabaviruses (SupplementaryFigure S9.4), betaflex-Synonymous-site variability in HEV. Top--map of the HEV genome (GenBank accession NC 001434.1; 7176 nt; genus Hepevirus, family Hepeviridae). ORF1 encodes the nonstructural protein domains which are translated from the genomic RNA. Both ORF3 (which encodes an accessory protein) and ORF2 (which encodes the capsid protein) are translated from a sgRNA; ORF3 is in the +1 reading frame with respect to ORF2. (a) Analysis of synonymous-site variability in an alignment of 192 HEV sequences (see the caption toFigure 1for details) using a 5-codon sliding window to obtain a high-resolution map of overlapping functional elements. Here the two stem loops in the middle of the capsid-coding ORF are clearly resolved as separate features. Small breaks in the P-value and obs/exp lines at the starts of ORF3 and ORF2 indicate, respectively, the intergenic region between ORFs 1 and 3, and the junction between overlapping ORFs 2 and 3 where a partial codon (i.e. 2 nt) has been omitted from the calculations. (b) Analysis of the same alignment with a 25-codon sliding window. Larger sliding window sizes are more useful for identifying extended overlapping features such as overlapping genes. Here, the overlapping ORF3 is clearly revealed. (c) Provided the sequences are sufficiently divergent, even an alignment of two sequences (here, GenBank accession numbers NC 001434.1 and AB161718.1; 75-codon sliding window) can reveal extended features such as the overlapping ORF3.

Synplot2 was applied to alignments of different numbers of HEV sequences randomly selected from the 192-sequence alignment used inFigure 6(see text). For each alignment, the average P-value (filled circles) for the alignment was calculated for a given sliding window size (indicated at bottom right of each panel) and hypothetical level of reduced synonymous-site variability (obs/exp), a calculation which depends only on the null model. The 'divergence' of each alignment (measured by the mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site over the phylogenetic tree) is indicated at the bottom, and the number of sequences in each alignment is indicated at the top. The latter may be illustrative but is not a good indicator of alignment diversity, e.g. two 2-sequence alignments were used, one with an alignment divergence of 0.08 nucleotide substitutions per site and the other with an alignment divergence of 0.25 nucleotide substitutions per site. In each panel, the dashed line indicates a P-value of 0.05 corrected for multiple testing within the HEV genome (i.e. 0.05 / (HEV coding region size / window size); seeFigure 1caption).

Maximum signal for a specific feature will be achieved when the window size is equal to the size of the feature. A window size of 45 codons works well for many overlapping genes. Functional RNA structural elements often fall in the range 7-25 codons; however window sizes below \u223c9-13 codons can produce noisy results and are best avoided except for the most highly sequenced species; a window size of 15 codons works well for many cases. Functional primary sequence elements (for example paramyxovirid transcriptional slippage sites, PAX-like +1 frameshift sites, protein binding sites and nidoviralid TRSs) are often <5 codons and might escape detection, though they are often associated with other features (overlapping genes in the first two cases, potential regulatory sequences in the last) that may be detected.",
