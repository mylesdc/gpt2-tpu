            "text": "Mindfulness meditation originates from a Buddhist tradition, but in its current formulation requires no particular religious orientation or belief system. It involves systematic training in the development of a sustained, non-aroused state of attention and clear awareness. Mindfulness is a meditation practice that cultivates paying attention in the present moment, bare of judgment, commentary, and decision. It trains the recognition of automatic reactivity such as habituated patterns of behavior, emotional reactivity, momentary distractions and loss of attention, and thus can attenuate stress reactions and other adverse emotional reactivity. MBSR cultivates awareness, stability, insight and choice. Mindfulness includes working with how one relates to environmental stimuli, one's sensitivity to bodily sensations, breathing, states of mind (thinking and emotions), and habitual patterns of automatic reactivity. MBSR training includes the cultivation of attitudes of self-appreciation, compassion, and empathy.",

For those with access to appropriate facilities/ equipment, swimming or bicycling (stationary or mobile) may be selected. Alternatively, dance could be chosen as the primary exercise. It is expected that most participants will choose a primary means of achieving moderate intensity exercise, and that walking or jogging will fulfill that role most often.

Hundreds of candidate primers were made and then tested against a panel of 140 cloned viral target cDNAs at 20 copies per reaction for the best specificity and sensitivity. This work yielded 19 primer sets for all target viruses. Each primer set was specific for the intended target and highly sensitive, detecting 20 copies of target cDNA or less, with a typical signal/noise ratio of 10 to 50. The performance and practicality of this Respiratory Multicode Assay (RMA) has been assessed by analyzing two sets of specimens. The first set consisted of 105 clinical specimens that were positive for HRV, RSV, Flu, PIV or Ad by traditional techniques. By RMA, all target viruses were detected with an overall rate of 91.4%. The second set of specimens consisted of 103 nasal mucus samples from 5-year old children with asthma and respiratory symptoms. The RMA detected viruses in 76 specimens (73.8%) compared to only 24 (23.3%) by traditional techniques. HRVs were the most frequent viruses detected (40/76). These results show that this high throughput and comprehensive PLx-based assay will improve the practicality and accuracy of detecting respiratory viruses in large epidemiologic studies. After its completion, RMA has been used for successfully analyzing ~30000 nasal samples (references are listed below).",

The procedures by which data were collected and verified during the preliminary trial described above were strong, but will be improved further for the proposed research. Specifically, we will develop a computer-assisted weekly monitoring system to improve identification, verification and monitoring of ARI illness. This security-protected web-based data collection system will be developed and overseen by UW Department of Family Medicine (DFM) programmer, Don Thomson, and administered by a DFM data manager to be hired and trained. Real-time inspection of incoming data will allow early identification and correction of any potential errors. Blinding of the person implementing this system to experimental group will reduce potential bias arising from self-report. Implication of strict criteria for defining the beginning and end of each ARI illness episode will further strengthen data integrity. Data that is not directly entered by participants (eg. monthly self-report questionnaires) will be scanned directly into a comma delimited database, with resulting electronic data compared to data on paper by hand. For data that is entered by project personnel, verification will be performed by someone other than the individual originally collecting the data, or by double-data entry. These procedures will facilitate verification of all primary and secondary endpoint data against original source documents. Statistical analysis will not be carried out until all data is complete.",

The primary contact cannot feasibly be blinded to allocation, which could potentially lead to bias. Thus, we will employ blinded-to-allocation personnel to assist participants with documenting and classifying ARI illness, sick days, and clinic visits. For most participants, weekly computer-assisted self-reports will be used to assess ARI illness. For those without internet access, weekly telephone calls will be scheduled. As soon as an ARI illness episode is verified by criteria, the participant will self-administer a nasal swab, and arrange a clinic visit where nasal wash will be obtained. During ARI episodes, participants will fill out respiratory infection daily logs, including both WURSS-24 self-assessments and questions documenting health care utilization and days lost to work. Adherence to meditation protocol during the 8-week program will be assessed by attendance records, teacher ratings of class participation, and daily practice logs. The meditation and exercise surveys will serve as additional intervention checks in that scores are expected to change more among those randomized to these interventions than to control groups. Continued adherence to meditation practice after the 8-week session will be assessed during bi-weekly phone contact during the 6month observation period. Integrity and consistency of both the meditation and exercise behavioral training sessions will be assured by the use of a structured training manual and by employment of the same instructors throughout the project.",

The basic mediational framework involves a three variable system in which an initial independent variable affects a mediational variable, which, in turn, affects an outcome variable (Baron & Kenny, 1986) . The aim of mediational analysis is to determine whether the relation between the treatment conditions and the outcome variables is due, wholly or in part, to mediator conditions. While the Baron and Kenny (1986) approach (BK) is somewhat straightforward, it is complicated by the inclusion of longitudinal models. To address this challenge, we propose remodeling our longitudinal models as hierarchical models, with the repeated measures nested under each subject. Krull and MacKinnon (2001) have recently demonstrated an expansion of the Baron-Kenny approach to encompass hierarchical models. The BK approach may be incorporated into our proposed secondary analysis modeling strategy for assessing longitudinal data.",

The ITT approach: 1) preserves the effects of randomization, and 2) addresses the practical impact of interventions better than per protocol analyses. Because of potential consequences of missing data, it is a major goal of our trial to keep missing values to minimal. Inevitably, however, there will be some missing values, both in terms of sporadically missing items from those that complete the protocol, and from people who withdraw or are lost to follow-up. Several ad hoc methods for dealing with missing data in clinical trials have been used and were considered. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) To deal with issues involved with participants who withdraw or are lost to follow-up, we propose dividing our subjects into two groups; protocol completers and non-completers. Variables based on these groupings will then be assessed for meeting the assumptions of either MCAR using Little's test (7) or MAR, using procedures proposed by Pottoff, et., al (8) . Contingent upon achieving either MCAR or MAR, the following imputation strategy will be used for our ITT analysis. If the missing values are NMAR, then standard methods of analysis are not valid and usually a sensitivity analysis is recommended. Stage 1 imputation will proportionally randomize protocol non-completers to either a \"no ARI episode\" (zero) designation or to a designation of \u2265 1 ARI episodes, with variable duration and global severity. In the first MEPARI study, 66 of 149 people (44.3%) randomized had at least one ARI illness episode. Stage 2 will then use multiple imputation methods (9) to impute the specific missing values of AUC and duration for those subject imputed to a non-zero ARI illness situation. The issue of sporadically missing data from protocol completers is most relevant to the primary outcome of global severity, assessed as area-under-the-time-severity curve, where the X-axis = duration and Y-axis = severity.",

The p \u2264 0.025 cut-off is chosen to be conservative and to allay concerns related to multiple comparison considerations. One-sided testing is supported by our own data and by available scientific literature. Given these parameters and our preliminary data, the sample size of n=120 per group should provide adequate power. However, when taking into account the zeroinflated and skewed nature of ARI illness data, and potential missing data and intention to treat considerations, actual power may be less. Given limitations on resources available, and a desire to minimize chances of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors, we feel that the proposed sample size will be adequate for this phase 2 randomized controlled human subjects clinical trial.",

Because the zeros are accounted for the logistic portion of the model, the counts or values portion can reflect, more accurately, the non-zero distribution. We proposed a censored inflated regression model, where two equations are estimated, one binary (no occurrence of a cold) and one for the continuous measures of severity and duration. The continuous model is for patients who are above the censoring point, in our case zero. The binary is for those patients above versus below the censoring point, and is a logistic regression model (i.e., it predicts those above versus below the censoring point). Mplus Version 6.12 (Muthen and Muthen, 2011) will be used to construct our censored-inflated normal models",

Use a capillary tube or pipette to plate or charge well-mixed specimen on both sides of the hemocytometer. See arrows on figure below. Be careful not to over-or undercharge the chamber or introduce air bubbles. 7. Allow the plated hemocytometer to sit under a wet house for a few minutes for cells to settle.TIP: When a sample-especially one with high cellularity-sits in the chamber too long, cells tend to start lining up on the grid lines and may affect accuracy of count. Try a larger dilution and replate. 8 . Focus counting grid under low power (10\u00d7), and then using high dry objective (45\u00d7 or 20\u00d7), count and differentiate the WBCs only. 9.

Brief Description of the Purpose of the Study: The primary goal of this project is to determine whether behavioral training in mindfulness meditation or moderate intensity sustained exercise can lead to reductions in acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness, such as common cold and influenza. Our preliminary findings suggest substantial benefit of these interventions in terms of reduced incidence, duration and severity of ARI illness, with corresponding reductions in days of work lost to illness. If the proposed research confirms these findings, there may be major implications for public and private health-related policy and practice, as well as for scientific knowledge regarding health maintenance and disease prevention.B. Adherence Statement: The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan outlined below will adhere to the protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin -Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (UW HS-IRB) and the Clinical Research Unit (CRU -formerly Clinical and Translational Research Core) Review Committee.",

For cohort 1 (2012-13) the following date will serve as cut-off for ITT analysis: Sept. 3. Per protocol (PP): Only people who attend at least 5 of the 9 exercise or mindfulness sessions will be included. For cohort 1 (2012-13) the following date will serve as cut-off for PP analysis: Oct. 22. April 26, 2013 Co-I meeting => Clarification of cut-off date For Cohort 1, the monitoring period will end at 11:59 p.m. on May 19, 2013. Any ARI illness episodes ongoing at that time will continue to be monitored for up to 14 days of illness duration, and included in primary efficacy analysis. Associated ARI-related absenteeism and health care utilization will also be assessed and included in analysis. PHQ-9 administration The Westat site monitor noted that a single sentence in the approved 7-18-12 protocol specifies the PHQ-9 is to be administered at the run-in visit and again at the baseline visit. For Cohort 1, it was administered only at the run-in visit. The decision was made that remaining cohorts will continue to have the PHQ-9 administered only once at baseline, during the run-in visit. Sept. 6, 2013 Co-I meeting => Clarification of analysis planIntention to treat (ITT): all ARI episodes, missed work, etc. that occur after randomization envelopes are opened. For cohort 2 (2013-14) Sept. 7, 2013, will serve as cut-off for ITT analysis. Only ARI starting on or after Sept. 7, 2013, will be included. Per protocol (PP): Only people who attend at least 5 of the 9 exercise or mindfulness sessions will be included. For cohort 2 (2013-14) Oct. 21, 2013, will serve as cut-off for PP analyses. Only those ARIs that start on or after Oct. 21, 2013, will be included in PP analyses. Oct 18, 2013 Co-I meeting => Clarification of analysis planIntention to treat (ITT): We will count all ARI episodes, missed work, etc. that occur after randomization envelopes are opened for each individual; we will not use standard dates to apply across all participants. This clarification was decided upon by full CoI committee after Dr Barrett discussed the issue with study advisor Dr David DeMets on October 8. This does not affect PP analysis, where cohort-specific standard dates will be used as described above. Nov 8, 2013 Co-I meeting => Clarification of retention plan After some back-and-forth with IRB regarding an individual who changed her mind about willingness to accept flu shot, it was agreed to continue original plan, with clarification, \"Unless there are safety concerns or other sufficiently strong reasons, the study team will strive to retain and monitor all randomized participants. Changing status in relation to eligibility criteria will not be grounds for withdrawing participants. \" Feb 6, 2014 Co-I meeting => Procalcitonin to cease Virtually all of the procalcitonin results collected from Cohort 1 participants were reported as undetectable, even during ARI episodes. Due to substantive cost and because we can't usefully analyze these results, it was decided at the Jan 31 Co-I meeting to cease processing procalcitonin as a study biomarker. Confirmed by NIH NCCAM study officer John Glowa in emails 2-6-14 March 28, 2014 Co-I meeting => Clarification of cut-off date For Cohort 2, the monitoring period will end at 11:59 p.m. on May 18, 2014.

Participants randomized to receive meditation training document the number of minutes of formal and informal practice for each day of that week. Those in the exercise group similarly document the number of minutes of moderate and strenuous exercise by self-report each week. People in the control and exercise group do not report minutes of meditation practice, and those in the control and meditation group do not report minutes of exercise. However, participants in all three groups fill out the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) at baseline, and then approximately every 2 months throughout the study. To date, the study has not included any \"objective\" measures of mindfulness or exercise. Adding in breath-counting and accelerometry measures for willing participants in the final cohort will strengthen the study by providing some objective evidence of sustained mindful attention (breath-counting) and physical activity (accelerometry), before and after interventions, in all three study groups. Resulting data will: 1) be correlated with self-reported practice data, and 2) be used for between-group exploratory efficacy analyses. Adding these measures for all willing participants will provide potentially valuable data, but will not interfere with or change the original aims or outcome measures for this NIH R01 funded phase 2 trial. The sponsoring entity at NIH, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, has approved this optional add-on sub-study.",

            "text": "Accelerometer data will be processed using the sojourn-3 axis method [3] to calculate minutes spent in sedentary, light, low-moderate, high-moderate, and vigorous levels of physical activity. A major advantage of this method of analysis is that it improves the classification of sedentary behavior and light intensity activities compared to single axis sojourns or traditional cut-point classification systems. Briefly, this method analyzes data in 1-second epochs using all three axes to identify bout intervals (starting and stopping activity), determine which intervals qualify as activity or inactivity and estimate metabolic equivalent (MET) values of each bout. This method does not use cut-off points for activity categories because it incorporates all three axes and a neural network to determine the wearer's movement pattern. Resulting MET values will then be broken into activity categories accordingly: <1.5 METs: sedentary, 1.5-2.99 METs: light, 3-6 METs: moderate and >6 METs: vigorous.Both average sedentary time and minutes spent during sustained sedentary behavior will be calculated and used for the sedentary assessments. Sustained sedentary time is operationally defined as <1.5 METs sustained for at least 20 consecutive minutes. This is an adaptation from Ellingson and colleagues [4] examining shorter time intervals for sustained sedentary behavior to more thoroughly examine sedentary behavior. 4 Physical activity and sedentary time will be correlated to self-reports from the GPAQ using Pearson's r product-moment correlation coefficients and Spearman's \u03c1 or log-transformations when data is non-normal (often the case for higher intensities of physical activity). Exploratory analyses will be performed comparing these measures of physical activity behaviors and the primary outcome variables from the main study.Analysis of the breath-counting exercise is somewhat more straightforward, as there are only 15 minutes of data to contend with for each of the three observation periods. The primary indicator is the proportion of breath cycles that are accurately recorded (8 breaths keyed correctly followed by one breath keyed correctly). Counting accuracy will be calculated as the number of correct count sets divided by the total number of count sets, i.e., 100% -(# of incorrect ongoing 9-counts + # of incorrect count probe responses + # of self-caught miscounts) / (# of ongoing 9-counts + # of count probe responses + # of self-caught miscounts). Experience sampling during breath counting will yield a set of mind wandering ratings and a set of meta-awareness ratings. Each set will be averaged to index state mind wandering and state meta-awareness, respectively. For analyses of ratings accompanying correct vs. incorrect count probes, participants without data in both categories (e.g., never off count at probe) will be excluded.Both accelerometry and breath-counting data will be compared to several self-report indicators, and will be assessed as an indicator of mindfulness (breath-counting) and physical activity (accelerometry). Breath-counting accuracy, mind-wandering and meta-awareness scores will be compared to self-report questionnaires rating mindfulness (MAAS), mindful selfefficacy (MSES), and positive and negative emotion (PANAS) for all participants, and to meditation logs for those receiving mindfulness trainings. Accelerometry data will be compared to exercise self-efficacy (ESES) and physical activity (GPAQ) scores for all participants, and to exercise logs for those in that group. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to determine whether randomization to training in exercise or mindfulness influences accelerometry or breath-counting scores, and if so, whether those changes are sustained. The basic analysis structure described in the main protocol will not be changed. All results from this optional add-on sub-study will be interpreted with caution.",
