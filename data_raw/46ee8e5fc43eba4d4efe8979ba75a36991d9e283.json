For medical items, the highest rate of outsourcing is in the ambulance units (51.4 percent), while the hemodialysis center follows close behind with a rate of 50 percent. For departments of nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing however, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3 percent. This shows that Taiwan's hospitals are still conservative in their willingness to outsource for medical items. The results of the satisfaction paired t-test show that the non-medical items have a higher score than the medical items. The factor analysis showed the three significant factors in of non medical items' outsourcing are \"performance\", \"finance\", and \"human resource\". For medical items, the two factors are \"operation\" and satisfaction\". To further exam the factor validity and reliability of the satisfaction model, a confirmative factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using structure equation modeling (SEM) method and found the model fitting well.",

Frost & Sullivan [2] found that the European healthcare IT outsourcing market generated revenues of US$396.4 million in 2005 and estimates they will reach US$697.7 million in 2010. Outsourcing is contracting with another company or person to do a particular function while off-shoring simply means having the outsourced business functions done in another country. Off-shoring is another type of outsourcing. Off-shoring is one situation in which developing countries that are able to adopt standards, processes, and language of developed countries can benefit from the liberalization of the movement of goods and services [3] .",

Even though outsourcing has many benefits, outsourcing will fail if not managed successfully. Hospital executives must choose outsourcing providers who hold the necessary leadership capabilities. Managing outsourcing requires an understanding of outsourcing strategy, the benefits and risks of outsourcing, the evaluation process, and the methods to managing outsourcing providers. With appropriate management, strategic outsourcing should provide healthcare executives with a viable strategy for controlling costs and maintaining quality patient care [4] [5] [6] . The most outsourced functions in healthcare are information technology (29 percent) , finance (20 percent) , and support services (19 percent) [7] . By outsourcing, hospitals can reap the benefits of medical device reprocessing without assuming additional staffing and compliance burdens. Outsourcing enables hospitals to implement a medical device reprocessing program quickly, with no capital investment and minimal effort [8] . Before negotiating any outsourcing transaction, hospital executives should carefully analyze the legal and regulatory implications, which will vary according to the type of services and the vendor involved [9] .",

For example, savings from low -cost wages may not compensate for the costs incurred from turnover and quality problems that come from an inexperienced, poorly trained, and unstable workforce [11, 12] . apparent cost means the cost can be seen in the income statement for buy the service or goods.

For in-depth interview, one hospital is not-for-profit and located in central Taiwan, while the other is a public hospital located in Taipei. Two of the hospitals assessed were medical centers with more than 1000 general beds and they were well known on outsourcing in medical items as well as on the non medical items. The in-depth interview were to ask the hospital's situation about outsourcing, and the feeling include what they think about the outsourcing can get benefit to them and the advantage and disadvantage of it. The interview time lasted for continuously four hours. The questionnaires were mailed to all 17 medial centers and all 71 region hospitals, while the 77 local hospitals were chosen by stratified system sampling methods from 382 local hospitals. The sample medical centers have the bed number from 800 to 2500, region hospitals' size normally between 300 beds to 800 beds, and local hospitals are from 20 to 300 beds in Taiwan. The total sample size is 165, with 37 completed questionnaires returned; The returned samples in medical centers were 6/14 = 35.3%, in regional hospitals were 21/71 = 29.5%, and in local hospitals were 10/77 = 12.9%. We prudently analyzed the returning samples and find they were evenly spread across the north, central, and south region of Taiwan; therefore, we believe it can represent the Taiwan hospital system. However, the returned local hospital samples were few, the reason could be: this level of small hospitals always own and operate by physicians and his/her families, therefore, unwilling to fill this kind of academic questionnaire due to lack of manpower.",

The third part is the definition of outsourcing, and inquires whether the hospital outsources at 9 non-clinical items and 10 clinical items which categories revised from Yigit (2007) paper.

The reason that the medical and common waste outsourcing rate is high is because Taiwanese hospitals have limited space, and lack the area to build refuse burning facilities. Similarly, the newer hospitals are not built with laundry facilities because the laborers and machines take up too much space. Outsourcing this service has saved hospitals space and funds. The gift store is also frequently outsourced because it is not one of the hospital's major concerns; therefore, they usually rent the space out or cooperate with chains of retail stores.",

In general, these hemodialysis companies could provide unify and better quality with a reasonable price. However, the other medical items show a much lower percentage of outsourcing rate such as nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3%.

The reason that medical items can surpass the non medical items on satisfaction score is the medical items need more professional training, purchase and maintain medical equipment, and normally the size of the outsourcing companies are much bigger and show their companies' discipline and speciality performance on their job.

For non medical items, this study define the first factor is \"performance\", this means hospitals believe outsourcing have better ability on the performance. The second factor is \"finance\", this means outsourcing can contribute hospital's finance and also help hospitals to overcome the dramatically changing medical environment, such as the keeping going down reimbursement system of the \"individual hospital global budget\" of National Health Insurance of Taiwan. The third factor is \"human resource\", such as the security, linen, and waste treatment, outsourcing have great contribution to hospital's limited human power.
