(Euphorbiaceae), one of Iranian endemic Euphorbias, with particular attention to triterpene constituents, using methanol solvent extraction was carried out. Five known triterpenes, including four cycloartanes and oleanolic acid, were isolated for the first time and identified using NMR and spectrometric Mass techniques. Anti HIV activity of the isolated triterpenes and ingenoid diterpenes was evaluated using single cycle replicable HIV-1 (SCR HIV-1) virions. Molecular features of the most active compound (IC 50 = 0.008 \u03bcM, CC 50 = 3.264 \u03bcM, TI = 380.64), which showed higher therapeutic index than nevirapine, was assessed using molecular docking. Docking studies demonstrated three hydrogen bonds between HIV-1 virion protease active site and this compound with a distance less than 3 A\u00b0 which can be responsible for the observed anti HIV-1 activity.",

E. erythradenia Bioss. is one of Iranian endemic spurges (2) which few phytochemical studies have been reported for this plant. Some species of this genus are used in folk medicines to cure skin diseases, gonorrhea, migraines, intestinal parasites, and warts (1) which most of them have been proved by modern phytochemical and pharmacological studies.

Filtration and under vacuum evaporation resulted in a green gum (433.2 g, 15.47% of dried powder weight), that was suspended in 1 liter methanol 80% and fractionated with hexane (1 lit \u00d7 3) which led to 51.3 g (1.83% of dried powder weight) hexane fraction. Methanolic suspension was further fractionated three times with 1 liter of chloroform that resulted in 37.7g chloroform fraction (1.35% of dried powder weight). Chloroform fraction was subjected to silica gel column, using hexane/chloroform (30\u2192100) and chloroform/methanol (0\u219220), to render several fractions: F [1] [2] [3] [4] . Subsequently, the richest fraction in triterpenoids, F 2 (based on TLC visualization after cerium sulfate solvent spraying and heating), was chromatographed on silica gel C.C. (hexane/ethyl acetate, 0\u219260) to afford five subfractions; TF 2a -TF 2e . Subfractions were injected into preparative HPLC using hexane/ethyl acetate gradient system at detection wavelength of 270 nm. Fractions were inspected and combined using TLC and heating after acidic cerium sulfate solvent spraying which resulted into pure compounds: TF 2b1 (1a & 1b, 15 mg), TF 2c2 (2, 18 mg), TF 2d5 (3, 13mg) . Moreover F 3 was subjected to column of silica gel and washed with hexane/ethyl acetate (0\u219220).

The presence of these additional carbons is in agreement with the ESI-MS m/z at 315 [M -127] + and 297 [M -H 2 O -127] + as the results of cycloartane side chain fragmentations. Taking these features into consideration and reviewing literatures (8, 9), compound 2 was determined as cycloart-23-ene-3\u03b2,25-diol.Existence of cycloartane structure in the backbone of compound 3 was revealed by the presence of a pair of doublets in 1 H-NMR spectrum (\u03b4 H 0.33, J = 4.0 Hz and 0.53, J = 4.0 Hz) and comparison of compounds 3 and 1a 13 C-NMR spectra. Moreover, based on BB decoupled 13 C-NMR spectrum and DEPT, side chain contained three methyl groups, two methylene groups, one oxygenated methine group and an oxygenated quaternary carbon in accordance of EI-MS m/z at 316 [M -145] + and 297 [M -H 2 O -145] + that are side chain fragmentation results. Two singlet methyl signals at \u03b4 H 1.16 and 1.22 suggested the linkage of two methyl groups and oxygenated quaternary carbon and the third methyl has a doublet at \u03b4 H 0.89 (J = 5.6 Hz) which points to neighboring methyl to methine. Finally, reviewing the literatures (8, 10) and considering these data, compound 3 was determined as cycloart-3\u03b2,24,25-triol.Compound 4 exhibited a positive HRESI-MS pseudo-molecular ion [M + H] + at m/z 457.3623 suggesting its molecular formula as C 30 H 48 O 3 .",
