            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), an attractive DNA amplification method, was developed as a valuable tool for the rapid detection of Toxoplasma gondii. In this study, species-specific LAMP primers were designed by targeting the AF146527 sequence, which was a conserved sequence of 200-to 300-fold repetitive 529 bp fragment of T.gondii. LAMP reaction system was optimized so that it could detect the minimal DNA sample such as a single tachyzoite or 10 copies of recombinant plasmid. No cross-reactivity was found when using DNA from other parasites as templates. Subsequently, a total of 200 human blood samples were directly investigated by two diagnostic methods, LAMP and conventional PCR. Fourteen of 200 (7%) samples were positive for Toxoplasma by LAMP (the primers developed in this study), whereas only 5 of 200 (2.5%) were proved positive by conventional PCR. The procedure of the LAMP assay was very simple, as the reaction would be carried out in a single tube under isothermal conditions at 64\u02daC and the result would be read out with 1 h (as early as 35 min with loop primers). Thus, this method has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection and would be useful for rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis, especially in developing countries.",

Laboratory diagnosis has historically relied on one of the below several ways in acute T. gondii infection. For example, the parasitological and histological method is to isolate the tachyzoite stage from blood or body fluids such as tissue culture. The immunologic methods are the detection of T. gondii antigens or specific antibodies, such as indirect flurorescent-antibody test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [5, 6] . The molecular biological method as PCR is to amplify the specific T. gondii genes or DNA fragments [7] . The modified agglutination test, immunochromatographic test and the real-time PCR have also been developed as diagnostic methods for T. gondii infection [8] [9] [10] . Despite these advances, diagnosis of T. gondii infection remains unsatisfactory because serological methods are time-consuming, and false-positive results may occur due to extra-parasitic materials during parasite antigen preparation [11] , and sometime cannot differentiate early infections [12] . Although PCR-based techniques have been developed recently, they are limited due to long reaction time and the expensive cost of the apparatus [7, 13] . Therefore, it is still necessary that we develop the cost-effective and rapid detection methods for T. gondii.",

So far, LAMP has been applied for the diagnosis of various parasitic diseases, including trypanosomosis [15] [16] [17] , piroplasmosis [18] . In addition, LAMP has been used for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts [19] . LAMP assay has also been used for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii based on the B1 and TgOWP genes in water samples [20] , diagnosis of toxoplasmosis based on the SAG1, SAG2 and B1 genes from human blood samples [21] . Recently, AF146527 fragment (GenBank AccessionNo. AF146527), which is a 200-to 300fold repetitive 529 bp fragment of T. gondii, has been utilized for the development of a very sensitive and specific PCR for diagnosis [8, 22] , and even in LAMP assay on swine DNA samples [23] .",

Like other DNA amplification methods, the reaction is also related to several factors, including temperature, time etc. As shown in Fig 1A, LAMP reaction was set up at different temperatures from 59 to 70\u02daC. It is shown that the strongest signal was obtained when the reaction system was incubated at 63 to 64\u02daC, whereas almost no signal at 59-62\u02daC or over 67\u02daC. According to the proper temperature of Bst DNA polymerase of 64\u02daC, the optimal temperature of LAMP reaction was selected as 64\u02daC. Then the LAMP reaction was lasted for different times from 15 min to 90 min. The LAMP reaction needed at least 45 min, and the product reached maximum when lasted for 60 min (Fig 1B) . So the proper reaction time would be 1 hour. Mg 2+ could enhance the efficiency of the Bst DNA polymerase. Mg 2+ should keep at a proper level in the LAMP reaction system, since that the precipitation generated during the reaction would affect read out of the result with lower Mg 2+ , and too higher Mg 2+ level would decrease the specificity of LAMP reaction. Obvious DNA band was seen when the concentration of Mg 2+ was 3.0-6.0mM (Fig 1C) . Finally, the optimal concentration of betine was checked. With the betine concentration over 0.6 mM, the target fragment got well amplified, which is consistent with the previous report, which betine could improve the stability of long length DNA and the specificity of LAMP reaction [14] . Due to the inhibitory effect of large amount betine, the most suitable concentration of betine is 1.0 mM (Fig 1D) . ",

However, when plasmids containing single copy of AF146527 sequence were used, the detection limit was 10 copies of the target sequence.

All the five PCR-positive blood samples were proved by DNA sequencing, which suggested that there was no false-positive result. The above 5 samples were also be detected as positive by our LAMP assay (AF-LAMP and RE-LAMP), as well as Xuan-LAMP assay. Only one to three samples out of 5 PCR-positive samples were detected to be positive by B1-LAMP assay and B1/SAG1/SAG2-LAMP assays, suggesting their lower sensitivity. To amplify B1/SAG1/SAG2 genes, the LAMP assay was carried out according to their reported general reaction conditions [20] [21] . So, the lower sensitivity of B1/SAG1/SAG2-LAMP assay might be caused by the LAMP reaction efficiency, as well as the character of different sample types [20] [21] . For the 195 PCR-negative samples, several samples were judged as positive via our LAMP assay indicating higher sensitivity than the conventional PCR. Xuan-LAMP showed higher sensitivity (78/91) than the conventional PCR (70/91) in the detection of T. gondii [23] . Here the 170 samples in 195 PCR-negative samples were determined as positive by Xuan-LAMP assay, which indicated a surprisingly high sensitivity. This might due to the tissue specificity.",

Although detection rate varies among different LAMP assays, the LAMP method still has its advantages in specificity, rapidity, sensitivity and easiness for wide application both in veterinary and medical fields.
