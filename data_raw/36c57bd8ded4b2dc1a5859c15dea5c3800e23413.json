Using the isolated virus, we could obtain not only genomic information, but also several biological characteristics of the virus. In the phylogenetic analysis, the virus was found to belong to the recently proposed genus Shaanvirus. Through sequence analyses and in vitro testing, the isolated virus was also found to have haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein as one of the structural proteins. When mouse antiserum was generated against the isolated virus and tested, it was cross-reactive to human parainfluenza virus 1 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay but could not cross-neutralize human parainfluenza virus 1. In addition, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was not infectious in the mouse model. Collectively, this study provided basic information on further classification of the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and related viruses in the proposed genus Shaanvirus.",

Recent bat-associated paramyxoviruses were proposed to be grouped in a separate phylogenetic clade within a potentially separate genus such as Shaanvirus 13 which was distantly related to Jeilongvirus 14 . In addition, novel strains of bat paramyxoviruses in diverse genera have been reported continuously [15] [16] [17] . Based on the recent papers, bat paramyxoviruses found worldwide to date have belonged to the genera Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus and the unclassified proposed genera Shaanvirus.

Notably, even though the HN amino acids sequences were similar to those from viruses in the proposed genera Shaanvirus, it was also related to that of Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1, which belong to a different genus, Respirovirus (Table 1) . Maximum-likelihood tree analysis based on the full HN amino acid sequences also showed that the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was related to viruses in the genus Respirovirus ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). Therefore, the B16-40 HN amino acid sequence was compared to that of human parainfluenza virus 1 (KBPV-VR-44), and six regions that have at least six conserved amino acids were found. These regions were located on the sialidase superfamily domain and were structurally gathered together ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Among the seven neuraminidase active sites (R, D, E, R, R, Y, and E 23 ), two of these (E at the third site and Y) were located within the conserved amino acid sequences. These bioinformatics findings might indicate that the HN proteins of bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and human parainfluenza virus 1 (KBPV-VR-44) are genetically related, even though they are in different genera.

This result provided an evidence that there could be cross-reactivity between viruses belonging to different genera. Therefore, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40-related viruses circulating in bats might be one of the reasons why the wild bat sera was reactive with human parainfluenza virus 1 in the previous study. However, we could not find the cross-neutralization between bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and human parainfluenza virus 1. Based on the recent studies, cross-neutralization was found between the viruses in the same genus of paramyxoviruses: Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1, which both belong to the genus Respirovirus 24 , and human mumps virus and African bat mumps virus, which both belong to the genus Rubulavirus 25 . Further, the engaged proteins in the cross-reactivity between bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and human parainfluenza virus 1 had not been revealed. Therefore, although bat paramyxovirus B16-40 in this study was cross-reactive with human parainfluenza virus 1 in indirect immunofluorescence assay, it is difficult to say that the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was antigenically related with human parainfluenza virus 1.",

Through virus isolation, we could obtain not only nucleotide sequence information, but also several biological characteristics of the virus. Its putative HN protein was demonstrated to have haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. Mouse antisera against the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was also cross-reactive to human parainfluenza virus 1 in the indirect immunofluorescence assay, but could not cross-neutralize human parainfluenza virus 1.

Two weeks after the last immunization, antisera against the virus were obtained by cardiac puncture for further studies related to cross-reactivity in indirect immunofluorescence assay.
