The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) less than 10 years later demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross species boundaries and further highlights the importance of identifying novel lead compounds with broad spectrum activity. The coronavirus 3CL pro provides a highly validated drug target and as there is a high degree of sequence homology and conservation in main chain architecture the design of broad spectrum inhibitors is viable. The ZINC drugs-now library was screened in a consensus high-throughput pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking approach by Vina, Glide, GOLD and MM-GBSA. Molecular dynamics further confirmed results obtained from structure-based techniques. A highly defined hit-list of 19 compounds was identified by the structure-based drug design methodologies. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds is bioactive is excellent. Additionally, the compounds segregate into 15 significantly dissimilar (p < 0.05) clusters based on shape and features, which represent valuable scaffolds that can be used as a basis for future anti-coronaviral inhibitor discovery experiments. Importantly though, the enriched subset of 19 compounds identified from the larger library has to be validated experimentally.",

In humans, coronavirus infection results in respiratory tract complications with varying degree of severity and has been associated with gastroenteritis. Four human coronaviruses (HCoV; 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic in the human population and are mainly associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory illnesses. Another two human coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndromes and present a significant threat with their high fatality rates. The clinical presentation of the four non-severe, endemic, human coronaviruses is largely indistinguishable symptomatically, commonly presenting with rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough and fever [2, 3] . Majority of infections are associated with self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease or \"the common cold\" but can also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, [4] [5] [6] , asthmatic exacerbations [7] acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [8] and croup in HCoV-NL63 infected patients [9] , and commonly results in hospitalization. Febrile seizures have been reported for most human coronaviruses but the significance of HKU1 is alarming with one study indicating that 50% of patients infected with HKU1 experience febrile seizures [7] .",

Misdiagnosis of these outbreaks pose a further substantial threat to healthcare workers with nosocomial spread to other patients putting further pressure on an already strained healthcare system.

It has even been termed \"the Achilles' heel of coronaviruses\" [15] . A wide variety of inhibitor classes, including peptidomimetic analogues, covalent inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors have been assessed. These compounds have been identified by ab initio structure-based design, high throughput and virtual screening [15, 16] , where inhibitors either target the enzyme active site or the allosteric dimerization domain [17, 18] . The first generation of 3CL pro inhibitors were irreversible peptidomimetic structures, often five residues in length with at reactive warhead at the terminus that formed a covalent bond between the thiolate anion of the catalytic Cys145 residue and the reactive atom of the warhead [19] . These reactive warheads have included Michael acceptors [20] [21] [22] , aldehydes [23] , epoxy-ketones [24] , halo-methyl ketones [25] , and trifluoromethyl ketones [26] . Peptide derivative warhead inhibitors were later followed by the development of non-peptidic covalent inhibitors [27, 28] . The use of covalent inhibitors is however limited due there propensity for off-target side-effects and toxicity [29] . Recent studies have therefore focused more on the development of noncovalent inhibitors, which have generally produced large peptidomimetic compounds with low ligand efficiency [19] and currently there is still no effective therapy for the treatment of HCoVs [14] . All coronavirus 3CL pro share a high sequence homology, as well as main chain architecture and substrate conservation [30, 31] , which makes the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds more viable.",

Substrate specificity of coronavirus 3CL pro is mainly determined by the P 1 , P 2 and P 1 1 positions [31] . The P 1 position has an absolute specificity for glutamine which stabilizes the S 1 subsite via a hydrogen bond with the imidazole N\u03b52 of His162/3 and van der Waals interactions with surrounding residues of the S 1 pocket. The P 2 site has a preference for leucine or methionine to fill the hydrophobic S 2 pocket. The sidechains of the S 3 site are solvent-exposed and therefore this site is expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality, but shows a preference for basic residues [32] . Sidechains and backbones of residues surrounding the S 4 site create a highly congested pocket which favors a small, hydrophobic residue in the P 4 position, either Ser, Thr, Val or Pro [32] [33] [34] . The S 1 1 and S 2 1 subsites also accommodate small residues in the P 1 1 and P 2 1 positions, which may include Ser, Ala or Gly [33, 35] . A typical cleavage recognition site is therefore (Ser, Ala)-(Val, Thr)-Leu-Glu \u00d3 (Ser, Ala, Gly), which is conserved among all coronavirus 3CL pro [36] . These features can therefore be exploited in the design of potential broad spectrum lead compounds. Crystal structures of the 3CL pro for 229E, NL63, HKU1 and SARS-CoV were obtained from PDB. The 3CL pro of OC43 was obtained by homology modeling [37] . Vina performed the initial high throughput screen of the Drugs-Now dataset from ZINC, comprising a total of approximately 6.5 million compounds. Ligand files were obtained in 3D SDF format and converted to PDB with Open Babel [38] . Ligand PDB files were then converted to PDBQT with the prepare_ligand4.py script.",

For docking with Vina, the receptor was processed with Autodock Tools [39] where water molecules were removed and polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were added.

The ligand, in the pose predicted by molecular docking, was prepared by SwisParam [44] . The protein-ligand complex was then placed in the center of a solvated, cubic box, 1 nm from the box edge. The system was solvated with the spc216 water model and sodium counter ions were added to neutralize the system. The system was energy minimized by a brief dynamics simulation using Steepest Descent Minimization until steepest descent converged to Fmax <1000. Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [45] with a cutoff of 1 nm and periodic boundary conditions were applied. Both NVT and NPT equilibrations were run for 50,000 steps or 100 ps using a 2 fs time step and a leap-frog integrator. All bonds were constrained by the LINCS algorithm. PME was again used for long range electrostatics with a 0.16 Fourier spacing. Short range electrostatic and van der Waals cutoffs were 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm respectively. Coordinates, velocities and energies were saved every 0.2 ps. During NVT equilibration temperature coupling was achieved by V-rescale algorithm with a target temperature of 300 K. Pressure coupling during NPT equilibration was achieved via the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm and is incorporated in the NPT equilibration once temperature is stable to ensure the proper density is reached (approximately 1000 kg/m 3 ). Following NVT and NPT system equilibration an unrestrained, 10 ns simulation (5,000,000 steps) was run with the leap frog integrator, saving coordinates, velocities and energies every 2 ps.

The PDB entry contains a total of four chains, two chains form the active dimeric structure with the remaining two found in monomeric forms. Each chain contains the covalent inhibitor bound to the active site which undergoes nucleophilic attack of the active cysteine S\u03b3 to form an irreversible, covalent bond. As this inhibitor possesses several pharmacophoric features common to the natural substrate and favorable to drug development it was utilized to develop a pharmacophore model for virtual screening.",

This receptor possessed the largest binding pocket of all structures when analyzed by SiteMap (data not shown) and it was therefore proposed to provide the largest number of initial hit compounds. The primary hit-list consisted of the top 1500 ranked compounds from the high throughput virtual screen (HTVS) of the ZINC Drugs-Now dataset conducted by Vina, a quantity where further refinement and analysis would be achievable. Ranking the initial virtual screen based on docking score alone serves as a starting point in the selection criteria and assumes that the predicted binding affinity somewhat reflects true binding affinity [58] [59] [60] . The lowest binding score within this hit-list corresponded to\u00b49.5 kcal/mol. Scoring functions have shown success in differentiating between binders and non-binders [61] by ranking the binding score. For this reason, all ligands which achieved this score were also included in the study, yielding a total of 1527 hit compounds. Further assessment and refinement of this initial hit-list of 1527 ligands was conducted by redocking with Glide and GOLD and scoring with their respective scoring functions and MM-GBSA.",

This approach has frequently improved enrichment rates of active compounds in a virtual screening context, in comparison to the use of a single algorithm for docking and scoring [62] [63] [64] . The initial stage of refinement included redocking with Glide under standard precision and rescoring with its internal Glide GScore scoring function. In order to define a threshold binding score cut-off to prefilter hits, the crystallographic structure of 3V3M, with bound inhibitor ML188, was used. As most scoring functions cannot be compared between structures it is important to define a binding score cut-off based on a related experimental structure [57] . The inhibitor ML188 achieved a binding affinity estimation of\u00b48.1 kcal/mol when bound to 3V3M. In an effort to reduce the numbers of false negatives this value was decreased to\u00b47 kcal/mol. As a subsequent stage of hit-list refinement the identified hit compounds and 2ZU2 receptor were directly imported into GOLD for redocking and rescoring. A GOLDScore Fitness cut-off was defined as 60 and again used to prefilter hits [42] .",

The use of multiple techniques therefore improves the probability of identifying a diverse set of lead compounds. The pharmacophore model was based largely on a single covalent inhibitor. This inhibitor was chosen as it possesses several favorable noncovalent features for the generation of a pharmacophore model. As general practice, several inhibitors are often used to generate a pharmacophore model where features that are frequently repeated are included in the pharmacophore [73] . For 3CL pro these features are well documented [32, 70, 71, 74] and the presence of several active ligands would only serve to replicate the prior knowledge. The essential features of the pharmacophore model included a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P 1 position and a hydrophobic moiety in the P 2 position. Non-essential features included a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor in the position to interact with Glu166, a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P 4 pocket, a single hydrogen bond donor in the P 2 and P 3 pockets and an acceptor in the P 1 1 pocket. A total of four features, including the two essential features and any two of the non-essential features, within an excluded volume of 1 \u00c5 were required for a potential hit to satisfy the pharmacophore model. Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) was used to generate the pharmacophore model and conduct the virtual screen against the entire ZINC Drugs-Now dataset. To ensure a primary hit-list of manageable size, only ligands satisfying the pharmacophore within an RMSD of 0.5 \u00c5 where filtered to the initial hit-list, which included approximately 25,000 compounds. Since MOE utilizes a united atom force field, it was necessary to add hydrogens with Open Babel. The protonation of the ligands generated several steric clashes within the active pocket of 3D23 and refine-only docking with Glide was therefore used to remove these clashes. As the pharmacophore model only filters compounds based on the presence of a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P 1 position, and does not take into account distance and geometry essential for the formation of a hydrogen bond, the Pose Filter script of Schr\u00f6dinger was again used to further refine the hit-list, which now contained 3569 hits. Scoring this hit-list with MM-GBSA further reduced its size to 15 compounds with the previously defined cut-off value.",

To confirm the findings seen in docking and pharmacophore modeling and validate the binding mode of representative hit-compounds, a 10 ns molecular dynamic simulation allowed for an assessment of non-bonded energies and hydrogen bonding networks between ligand and receptor and ligand stability via RMSD, radius of gyration and changes in solvent accessible surface area. As molecular dynamic simulations are extremely computer intensive one representative ligand identified from molecular docking and one from pharmacophore modeling was used. The ability of molecular dynamic simulations to replicate the binding conformation and ligand stability would verify that the identified hit-list does in fact represent likely actives.",

A pyridine filled the S 1 pocket and formed a hydrogen bond between the pyridine nitrogen and imidazole N\u03b52 of His163. A 1,2,4-triazole formed a linker in the center of the structure and mediated the formation of a hydrogen bond between N2 and the backbone of Glu165/6, which formed a third hydrogen bond via the backbone carbonyl and ligand NH. OC43 3CL pro exhibited a fourth hydrogen bond between N4 of the 1,2,4-triazole and Gln189. This residue is conserved in 3D23 and 3V3M structures, however it was orientated towards the solvent exposed exterior of the pocket. In 2ZU2 and 3TLO the position of Gln is replaced by Pro188/9, which therefore did not contribute to the formation of a bond. Two 2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl rings also filled the hydrophobic S 2 and S 4 pockets ( Figure 3) . Molecular dynamics studies indicated that for 3V3M all these interactions were highly conserved, forming an average of three bonds over the simulation with high occupancies between His163 and both bonds at Glu166. The remaining four structures exhibited similar profiles however with varying degrees of occupancy, with an average bond formation of 2.5 for 2ZU2, 1.7 for 3D23, 2.6 for 3TLO and 2.1 for OC43 3CL pro . All structures displayed high occupancy at both Glu166 positions, however a decreased occupancy at the His162/3 position. OC43 3CL pro and 3D23 observed the lowest occupancy of 13.63% and 7.27% respectively and 2ZU2 and 3TLO displayed moderate occupancies of 25.30% and 41.05% respectively. The loss of hydrogen bond formation at this position was often caused by the pyridine ring orientating at a right angle to the His162/3 N\u03b52. With the exception of 3TLO all structures also formed hydrogen bonds with moderate frequency with Gln191/2. These bonds were predominantly formed via the backbone, however 2ZU2 was capable of forming with both the backbone and sidechain, where the sidechain exhibits a higher frequency. The bond formed between Glu189 and the N4 of the 1,2,4-triazole, as seen in docking results for OC43 3CL pro , exhibits a relatively low occupancy of 17.95%.",

The movement may most likely be attributed to by an initial minor loss of stability caused by the movement of Ala143 closer to the pyridine ring, with subsequent bond formation between the Ala backbone and pyridine N. This movement destabilized the pyridine ring, which subsequently formed a new hydrogen bond with Gly142. At this point the pyridine had almost completely lost its orientation in the S 1 pocket, which resulted in further loss of the van der Waals interactions leading to complete dissociation from the pocket ( Figure 5 ).

The position of 164, occupied by a His in 3V3M and a Gln in the remaining structures, showed varying degrees of bond formation, with the presence of the His in 3V3M resulting in a significant reduction in bond formation. Gln showed moderate, 41% for 3D23, to high, 88% for 3TLO, occupancy with OC43 3CL pro having an occupancy of 61%. The sidechain of Gln189 was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the ligand in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CL pro , however this residue was highly solvent exposed and therefore resulted in a high degree of flexibility of the sidechain, which should hinder the formation of this bond. For 3D23 and OC43 3CL pro this was observed, where the frequency of bond formation was 27% and 6% respectively. In 3V3M the ligand was however able to stabilize the sidechain to maintain the formation of the bond with a high degree of frequency at 73%.",

Structures, including 3V3M and 3D23, observed significant fluctuations within their stable conformation which was largely attributed to by the presence of the solvent exposed dioxolane moiety, which had few features and interactions to stabilize it within the pocket. As this structure contributed few interactions, future studies may explore the removal of this substituent to ascertain its effects on stability. Radius of gyration again confirmed RMSD results where all structures fluctuate between 4.7 \u00c5 and 5.0 \u00c5, with the exception of 2ZU2 which deterred greatly at approximately 6 ns that signified the point at which the pyridine ring completely dissociated from the S 1 pocket. This however did not result in an increase in solvent accessible surface area where all structures fluctuated between 3.8 nm 2 and 4.4 nm 2 . With the exception of 2ZU2, these structures confirmed, with great confidence, the interactions and conformations observed within our rigid pharmacophore model. The representative ligand identified by molecular docking was also able to largely fulfil the interactions and orientations observed.",

These compounds are generally large and have a high likelihood of off target effects through covalent modification and, as yet, there remains no commercially available molecular entity for the treatment of coronaviruses [14] . Few studies have focused on the development of broad spectrum, noncovalent inhibitors and, to our knowledge, none have aimed to prioritize the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds that inhibit the 3CL pro related to the coronaviruses that most frequently affect humans, namely 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. For this reason, there is insufficient knowledge surrounding the structure of broad spectrum inhibitors targeting this family of proteases. This study, focusing on these and the coronavirus associated with SARS, provides valuable insight into the structure of ligand scaffolds of potential noncovalent inhibitors.",

For this reason, we used a joint docking and pharmacophore modeling based virtual screening strategy to identify a highly defined list of potential lead compounds. Molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling are extremely useful tools in the design and identification of novel lead compounds and have relatively low infrastructure and fiscal dependence. Its importance in the pharmaceutical industry cannot be overlooked even though it does have several shortcomings. Fundamental flaws in these structure-based techniques include the static nature of the receptor and the implicit solvent models used for virtual screening. Molecular dynamics is the most advanced in silico tool, which allows us to fill this void by incorporating Newtonian physics to simulate the dynamic movements of proteins in an explicit solvent model thereby replicating the native environment of the protein. Molecular dynamic simulations also provide a mechanistic explanation for any ligand inactivity, which would be impossible to identify with in vitro techniques. In this study, it has identified the key feature responsible for the destabilization of the ZINC09411012 ligand within the 2ZU2 binding pocket and thereby allowed us to identify which substituents should be replaced in further rounds of lead optimization. As ligand inactivity may be a result of a single misplaced substituent this mechanistic view point provides extensive information for future lead optimization.",

The diverse and comprehensive approach of hit-list refinement also ensures a high likelihood of the presence of bioactives within the list. This study provides a promising start in the pursuit of active lead compounds for the broad spectrum inhibition of the 3CL pro associated with human coronaviruses. These results strongly support further in vitro testing of this highly refined hit-list. Activity data will provide valuable information on the structure of bioactive scaffolds and could represent the next generation of small lead molecules. In conclusion, in the drug-design sphere, a variety of computational approaches have been used at the various stages of the drug-design process in support of the experimental techniques. Structure-based and ligand-based drug design approaches have developed into valuable drug discovery tools [78] , owing to their versatility and synergistic character [79] . Importantly, however, predictions from virtual screening methods are not meant to replace experimental affinity determination, but can complement the experimental methods by producing an enriched subset of a large chemical database, with an increased possibility of the compounds actually binding to the drug target of interest [80, 81] . Therefore, since past research has shown that many predicted drug candidates fail to prove effective in vivo the experimental validation of the identified 19 ligands reported in this manuscript is essential.",
