In addition, such a vaccine constitutes the only realistic polio vaccine in the post-eradication era. One way to reduce the cost of a vaccine is to increase immunogenicity by use of adjuvants. The CAF01 adjuvant has previously been shown to be a safe and potent adjuvant with several antigens, and here we show that in mice IPV formulated with CAF01 induced increased systemic protective immunity measured by binding and neutralization antibody titers in serum. CAF01 also influenced the kinetics of both the cellular and humoral response against IPV to produce a faster, as well as a stronger, response, dominated by IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c isotypes as well as IPV specific T cells secreting IFN-c/IL-2. Finally, as intestinal immunity is also a priority of polio vaccines, we present a vaccine strategy based on simultaneous priming at an intradermal and an intramuscular site that generate intestinal immune responses against polio virus. Taken together, the IPV-CAF01 formulation constitutes a new promising vaccine against polio with the ability to generate strong humoral and cellular immunity against the polio virus.",

The initial objective, the end of polio by 2000, has proven more difficult than originally envisioned and polio still exist in countries such as Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan.

However, one problem with OPV is that on rare occasions OPV can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and/or can revert to a neurovirulent form of poliovirus which is believed to be as transmissible and virulent as wild polioviruses [1] [2] [3] . Therefore, steps have been taken to discontinue OPV as a vaccine against polio, rendering IPV the only realistic polio vaccine in the post-eradication era.",

One such challenge is that the high purchase costs for IPV potentially can lead to limited supplies of IPV in many countries. Another challenge concerns the immunity induced by IPV, and how to achieve intestinal immunity with this vaccine. IPV protects the vaccine recipient from paralysis, but compared to OPV it provides less protection against re-infection. Furthermore IPV does not reduce fecal excretion following reinfection as much as OPV because it provides weaker intestinal immunity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . There are however studies that demonstrated that IPV can induce some intestinal immunity [5] [6] [7] .",

In the field of pandemic influenza vaccines the use of adjuvants has permitted dose reduction, increased the availability and reduced cost of the vaccine [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, it has been speculated that an adjuvanted vaccine formulation of IPV would reduce cost and also increase the number of available IPV doses worldwide. In support of this, it was recently shown that the potency of Sabin inactivated polio vaccines is increased when adjuvanted with Aluminium hydroxide or CpG [15, 16] . CAF01 is a novel adjuvant composed of cationic liposomes DDA (dimethyldioctadecylammonium) stabilized with the synthetic immunomodulator TDB (trehalose 6,69-dibehenate) [17] . CAF01 has proven to enhance both humoral and cell-mediated memory immune responses to a number of different experimental vaccine candidates [17] [18] [19] in preclinical models. CAF01 has furthermore already been tested in three phase-I trials with an excellent safety and immunogenicity profile (EAG, personal communications and [20] [21] [22] ). Additionally, CAF01 was also found to provide dose-sparing when used in a combination with the trivalent influenza split vaccine in ferrets [23] . We therefore tested the suitably of the CAF01 adjuvant for inducing protective immunity against an infection with polio virus.",

IPV bound to CAF01 will be expected to be located in the vaccine pellet. Three mono-IPV-CAF01 vaccines were formulated to evaluate the binding of each IPV type 1-3. The results of the DU ELISA from centrifuged samples are shown in Fig. 1D . No IPV was found in the supernatant fraction of the three mono-IPV-CAF01 formulations, which indicated that all IPV serotypes are indeed bound to CAF01. This was in agreement with the Zeta potential analysis that suggested a favorable interaction of CAF01 and IPV. On analyzing the resuspended vaccine pellet a recovery rate of 30-75% IPV was obtained (Fig. 1D) . The reason for a recovery of less than 100% is most probably due to Steric hindrance (caused by CAF01) of the binding of the detecting antibodies in the IPV DU ELISA to IPV. However, we cannot fully exclude that some IPV was partly inactivated in the CAF01 formulation.",

Thus, the aim was to achieve 10 times dose sparing with CAF01. Mice were immunized with 20 DU IPV or with the lower 2 DU IPV, the latter with or without CAF01. The mice received two immunizations spaced by two weeks and neutralizing antibody titers were determined in the sera two weeks after the last immunization.",

Thereafter, the cells were stimulated in vitro with IPV for 72 hours and the supernatant was collected for Multiplex cytokine analysis. At week 2 post vaccination, in the IPV non-adjuvanted group, Multiplex cytokine analysis showed very low responses for both doses (Fig. 5A) . The highest response was observed with IL-2 (5256165 and 667665 pg/mL in the IPV 2 DU and 20 DU groups, respectively). In contrast, in the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 group we observed a significant increase for the cytokines IFN-c, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, IL-2 and TNF-a but not IL13. In particular, at week 2 post vaccination CAF01 led to strong induction of IFN-c (2379+/2490 pg/mL versus 153+/286 pg/mL in the IPV 2 DU group) and IL-10 (5024+/2927 pg/mL versus 232+/2138 in the IPV 2DU group).

In the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 we observed an increase in IFN-c (to 7492+/21896 pg/mL) and IL-2 (to 2432+/2383 pg/mL), but a significant (p,0.05) decrease in secretion of IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, and TNF-a compared to week 2 post vaccination.

Lower cost options being pursued include reducing the number of doses and the amount of antigen per dose [15, 16, 43, 44] . In addition, lowering the manufacturing cost for IPV in developing countries is a priority. Our results showed that with the adjuvant CAF01 we were able to achieve a 10 times dose sparing effect in mice measured by the virus neutralization titers in the blood (Fig. 2) . Importantly, the results also showed that two vaccinations with IPV 2 DU + CAF01 gave neutralization titers that either equaled those induced by 3 vaccinations with IPV 2 DU (Type 2 and 3 titers), or were slightly reduced (Type 1 titers) (Fig. 3) . Thus, addition of the adjuvant CAF01 induced a significant dose sparing effect, or allowed for a vaccine schedule with one less dose. The potential of applying only two vaccinations compared to three will have significant economical and practical impact.",

The study was based on IPV vaccines given at month 6 and 9, i.e. when maternal transferred antibodies have declined and consequently were not expected to inhibit the IPV vaccines. In addition, children receiving a previous OPV vaccination were protected with just a single IPV dose most probably due to boosting of a prominent OPV induced memory B cell response [45] . Thus, at least with a booster vaccine, the study indicated that one or two vaccinations should protect children in resource-poor settings against paralytic poliomyelitis [46] . Our results indicated that the inclusion of an adjuvant will affect both the required dose (allowing for a 106 reduced IPV dose) and the number of vaccinations (allowing for a vaccine schedule with less vaccine doses) required to induce proper protection against infection with polio virus.",

There were significantly lower rates of seroconversion for all three poliovirus types in a study performed in Thailand and for types 1 and 3 in an Oman study including babies from birth and 24 weeks onwards and with children with baseline maternal antibody titres of $64. In addition, previous studies have shown that IPV appears to be more sensitive than OPV to the effect of high maternal antibody titers on reducing the neutralizing antibody response to vaccine given in the first months of life [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, previous studies have highlighted two important points concerning the antibody response against IPV. One study showed that maternal antibodies inhibited vaccine-induced antibody responses but not T cell responses, and that the latter allowed for high antibody titers following a booster vaccine [53] . In addition, Krishnan et al. [54] showed that the negative effect of maternal antibodies on the response to IPV may be reduced by increasing the intervals between doses. Taken together, and in combination with our results, we suggest that with the inclusion of an adjuvant, such as CAF01, combined with a booster vaccine given at a longer interval than the commonly used 4 weeks (e.g. 8 weeks as proposed previously [54] ), a 5-10-fold reduction of the IPV vaccine dose is indeed feasible, even in the presence of maternal antibodies.",

Firstly, the antibody binding titers at week 2 post vaccination 2 were increased to levels that in most cases were higher than the levels induced by a 10 times higher IPV dose (20 DU) (Fig. 4) . This was observed against all three polio virus types (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, in contrast to for IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c, we only observed a minor IgG1 response in both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups (Fig. 4B) . In contrast, previous observations with the CAF01 adjuvant formulated with recombinant proteins showed a strong IgG1 response [55] . This suggested that even in the presence of a strong adjuvant, IPV can influence the IgG response. As the IgG isotype profile of the IPV-CAF01 vaccine resembled that of IPV alone, this suggested that it is IPV that determines the IgG profile even in the presence of CAF01.",

Although the cellular immune response is not considered a direct correlate of protection for polio vaccines it may play an indirect role by supporting a memory B cell response [56, 57] . Our analysis of anti-IPV T cell immunity revealed that CAF01 induced both a faster and stronger response against IPV. At week 2 post vaccination only a minor response was observed in the non-adjuvanted IPV groups in contrast to the CAF01-adjuvanted groups that showed increased levels against all the cytokines tested (Fig. 5A) . The CAF01 adjuvanted group also showed elevated cytokine responses at week 5 post vaccination 2. Interestingly our results also showed that the cytokine profile of the IPV-CAF01 group changed significantly from week 2 to week 5 to resemble the profile induced by IPV alone, a profile dominated by IFN-c and IL-2 secretion (Fig. 5B) . This indicates that IPV as an antigen can also influence the type of cellular immunity induced against it. Furthermore, as IFN-c is known to induce isotype switch to IgG2a, these results also explains the observed induction of IgG2a, and the lack of IgG1. Thus, both regarding the IgG response and the cellular T cell response the role of CAF01 in the formulation with IPV is to induce a response that is quantitatively different from the response induced by IPV but not qualitatively different. The observed T cell profile presented in our study is in agreement with a previous study showing the same cytokine profile following immunization with Sabin IPV +/2 Alum [40] . Interestingly, in that study it was also demonstrated that the T cells were required for the protection against a polio infection, most probably by acting as helper T cells for B cells, and through the stimulation of neutralizing antibody production of the IgG2a type. In addition, CD4 T cells have also been shown to be required for the generation of optimal antibody responses following infection with coronavirus [33] , vaccinia virus [34, 35] , yellow fever virus [36] or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [37] , supporting that the role of T cells against a viral infection such as polio virus should not be underestimated. We speculate that T cell immunity mediated by the IFN-c/IL-2 expressing Th1 T cells may be important for the protection against the polio virus due to their ability to 1) induce isotype switching to IgG2a and 2) induce innate immunity to contributes to antiviral immunity [40, 41, 58] .",

Therefore, inducing intestinal IgA is a priority of any polio vaccine. Several publications indicate an immunological connection between the intradermal and intestinal site [27, 28] . However, in humans, the results obtained with ID administration of IPV are not entirely clear. Thus, one large-scale pediatric study conducted in Cuba by the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research [60] failed to meet non-inferiority criteria, whereas another showed that three immunizations with one-fifth of the dose of IPV given ID resulted in similar seroconversion rates compared to three full doses of IPV given IM in infants [61] although the antibody were significantly lower in infants given the decreased ID dose of IPV [61] . Thus, the usefulness of the ID administration route for IPV is still being debated.",

            "text": "The results presented in this paper indicated that as an injection site to prime an immune response, the intradermal administration is not as efficient as the IM administration in mice. This was based on experiments showing reduced binding/neutralization titers in the ID group compared to the IM group, receiving the same vaccine (Fig. 6 ). In addition, the ID administration did not induce IgA in the intestine or in fecal samples ( Fig. 6 and data not shown) . However, compared to IM or ID alone administration, a side-byside ID+IM administration with a CAF01 adjuvanted vaccine followed by an IM administration induced significant levels of fecal IgA and, of importance, without compromising serum binding and neutralization titers. Although a subject for future investigations, it may be suggested that T cells primed systemically by IPV-CAF01 can be recruited to other sites, e.g. the intestine, and act as helper T cells to potentiate the response at these sites. This may be of some importance as it suggests that a strong intestinal priming may not be entirely required for intestinal protection as long as an intestinal challenge can effectively boost a pre-existing minor intestinal immunity and/or lead to fast recruitment of immunity residing in other (systemic) locations. In fact, in this respect it is of particular interest that some studies have shown that IPV (administered via the IM route) may indeed 'prime' substantial protective intestinal immunity [7] . Furthermore, in tropical developing countries, a supplemental dose of IPV administered to children previously exposed to OPV boosts humoral and intestinal immunity more effectively than a supplemental dose of OPV [5] [6] [7] 45, 62] , which is supported by a study performed in the Netherlands [63] . Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that an IM vaccination with IPV will induce immunity with some ability to interact with the intestinal site and that a simultaneous priming at both the IM and ID site with the same vaccine will increase the intestinal response.",

The formulation proved to constitute a stable formulation where the majority of IPV was associated with CAF01 and maintained its D-unit activity. IPV-CAF01 induced a strong systemic protective immunity in mice and also influenced the kinetics of the IPV immune response to produce a faster response. Finally, a simultaneous priming at an intradermal and an intramuscular site with the IPV-CAF01 vaccine led to intestinal immunity. CAF01 has successfully completed several phase I studies with other vaccine candidates, and further studies are now ongoing to support the development the IPV-CAF01 towards a human trial.
