            "text": "Background: Plant viruses in the genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae often cause substantial crop losses. These viruses have been emerging in many locations throughout the tropics and subtropics. Like many plant viruses, they are often not recognized by plant diagnostic clinics due in large part to the lack of rapid and cost effective assays. An isothermal amplification assay, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), was evaluated for its ability to detect three begomoviruses and for its suitability for use in plant diagnostic clinics. Methods for DNA extraction and separation of amplicons from proteins used in the assay were modified and compared to RPA manufacturer's protocols. The modified RPA assays were compared to PCR assays for sensitivity, use in downstream applications, cost, and speed. Results: Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays for the detection of Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, Tomato mottle virus and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were specific, only amplifying the target viruses in three different host species. RPA was able to detect the target virus when the template was in a crude extract generated using a simple inexpensive extraction method, while PCR was not. Separation of RPA-generated amplicons from DNA-binding proteins could be accomplished by several methods, all of which were faster and less expensive than that recommended by the manufacturer. Use of these modifications resulted in an RPA assay that was faster than PCR but with a similar reagent cost. This modified RPA was the more cost effective assay when labor is added to the cost since RPA can be performed much faster than PCR. RPA had a sensitivity approximate to that of ELISA when crude extract was used as template. RPA-generated amplicons could be used in downstream applications (TA cloning, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, direct sequencing) similar to PCR but unlike some other isothermal reactions.",

            "text": "Rapid, sensitive and specific detection of plant pathogens is an important aspect of disease management. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become one of the most commonly-used nucleic acid based methods for the detection of plant pathogens due to its speed, specificity and sensitivity [1] . PCR and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) can be designed to detect a narrow or broad range of targets through the use of specific or degenerate primers and amplified products can be viewed in electrophoretic gels, sequenced directly, and/or cloned. [2] [3] [4] . The disadvantages of PCR/RT-PCR for pathogen detection are the dependence on a thermocycler, inhibitory effects of co-extracted host plant inhibitors on amplification, and the time investment per sample [5] [6] [7] . While PCR/RT-PCR assays are used in the detection of plant viruses in research, the cost and time required are too great for many plant disease clinics. Real-time PCR (qPCR), reduces the time required for detection compared to PCR/RT-PCR, but has high start-up and instrument maintenance costs which has discouraged its adoption by many plant disease clinics.",

            "text": "Another type of isothermal amplification methodology is Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). RPA was first developed in 2006 and relies on the extension of primers induced by recombination proteins [12] . DNA binding proteins (gp32 single-strand DNA binding protein and two ATP-dependent recombinases, usvX and usvY) bind the primers and scan for the homologous sequence (target). The primers recombine with the target, and a mesophilic polymerase (Bacillus subtilis DNA polymerase I) extend the 3' end of the invading primer using the opposite strand as a template [12] . RPA reactions have been performed at constant low temperatures (25\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C), achieving amplification in as little as 15 min. PCR purification columns remove DNAbinding proteins from the amplicons to allow visualization of results. The use of columns adds to the expense and time required to complete the assay. The most commonly used methods to obtain results of RPA assays are visualization of amplified DNA by gel electrophoresis or amplicon sequencing although alternatives such as fluorescence and/or hybridization have been reported [12] [13] [14] . In addition to end-point detection of DNA targets, RPA formats have been developed for detection of RNA templates (RT-RPA), target quantification and chip-based detection [13] [14] [15] [16] , which demonstrate the flexibility of this type of assay for rapid pathogen diagnostics. RPA is widely used in the detection of animal and human pathogens [13, 17] . Its use in plant pathogen detection has been limited to four plant pathogens: two viruses, (Little cherry virus 2 (LChV2) and Plum pox virus (PPV)), a bacteria (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (HLB -Las)) and a fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum) ( [18, 19] AgDia,",

Using $35.00 as an estimate for 1 h of labor, the cost of detection for single samples using PCR was much higher than that of RPA using crude extracts or purified DNA.

RPA was able to detect 9.6 pg and PCR was able to detect 9.6 fg of purified TYLCV DNA. In the presence of plant contaminants, PCR was unable to generate visible amplicons, while RPA was able to generate amplicons but with a reduction in sensitivity. However, this was still within an acceptable range as it was equivalent to or greater than that of commonly used diagnostic assays such as ELISA and lateral flow immunochromatographic assays [33] . Our results in the sensitivity of detection of TYLCV DNA using RPA were similar to those reported for transcripts of two RNA plant viruses [18, 19] . In addition, RPA was comparable to PCR in specificity and flexibility for use in downstream applications.

In addition, the cost and time required to conduct an RPA assay could be reduced by the use of a crude extraction method for the template.

RPA represents a significant improvement in molecular diagnostic tools, with excellent potential for adoption in diagnostic service laboratories worldwide, especially those with minimal infrastructure. RPA is a versatile molecular diagnostic tool that extends the capabilities of diagnostic facilities without access to a thermocycler. Pathogen specific assays can easily be developed to detect plant viruses using RPA with only minor changes to primers originally developed for use in PCR [13, 37, 38] . In addition, RPA can be modified for detection in micro fluid and solid phase based devices [14, 18, 19, 39] , and with the addition of a reverse transcription step, can be used with RNA templates [13, 15, 18, 19] .",

The results of these studies using begomoviruses demonstrate that RPA offers significant advantages over current PCR technologies for the detection of plant viruses by diagnostic laboratories. RPA was less expensive and faster than PCR. While RPA was not as sensitive as PCR, it was equivalent to the sensitivity of currently used diagnostic techniques such as ELISA and lateral flow immunochromatographic assays. However, RPA was superior to these protein based assays in its ability to support downstream applications such as restriction enzyme digestion, TA cloning and direct sequencing. The speed, cost, specificity, sensitivity and ease of use make RPA an ideal assay for plant disease diagnostic laboratories.",
