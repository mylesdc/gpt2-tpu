In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 9506(454 sequencing) and 38,0006(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were ''selected'' from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.",

Some of these emergent viruses, such as HIV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are capable of causing epidemics of human disease. RNA virus populations sustain high genetic diversity due to the low fidelity of their polymerase, short genome, high replication rates and large population size [2] . For this reason a single RNA virus population can consist of a multiplicity of slightly different genomes, sometimes referred to as a mutant spectra [3] . The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts (interspecies transmission events) and the potential cause new human and zoonotic diseases [4] , however, very little is known about the particular mutations that enable interspecies transmission events to occur.",

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a betacoronavirus which is related to SARS-CoV and has caused disease in humans on at least one occasion [9] . BCoV is known to use 9-Oacetylated sialic acid to bind to host cells, although a second receptor may be involved [10] . The spike protein which is present on the surface of the virion, determines host range and tissue tropism of coronvaviruses. The receptor binding domain of BCoV has not been determined [11] , but a recent study by Peng at al. (2011) indicates that it falls within the N terminal domain [12] . BCoV infection may cause acute and severe diarrhea and respiratory symptoms in cattle especially under stressful conditions such as transport, but subclinical infections may occur in healthy cattle. BCoV isolates are generally obtained by inoculating nasal or fecal samples from infected cattle in human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18 cells), however the genetic changes in the viral population that allow this bovine virus to adapt to human cell lines have yet to be defined [13] .",

The consensus and subconsensus (variant) nucleotide sequences of cell culture passaged samples were compared to that of the natural ''unpassaged'' viral populations. The genome regions analyzed included nsp1and nsp3 (genes involved with evasion of the host innate immune response and other functions such viral replication), nsp14 (designated nsp11 in NCBI BCoV Reference Sequence: NC_003045.1; involved with polymerase fidelity), and the spike protein gene (determinant of host range) [7, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

Naturally-infected BCoV samples are often difficult to adapt to growth in cell culture [20] , however, it is essential to use naturally-infected samples rather than laboratory adapted virus strains because isolation in cell culture is likely to result in adaptive mutations not present in the naturally circulating virus. Therefore, every step of the virus passage protocol was optimized to allow for the greatest chance of virus particle recovery before and during cell culture passage including incubation time of the virus on cells, RNA extraction protocol, and RT-PCR protocol. Although trypsin has been shown to enhance infection of HRT-18 cells [20, 21] , it was not used in the infection protocol in order to keep protocols identical for infection of enteric, lung and macrophage cell lines. The three nasal samples (#'s 1, 27, and 59) that had the highest titer as determined by TaqMan RT-PCR were tested using the optimized protocols. A laboratory adapted strain, Nebraska (NEB) was included as a positive control for cell line infectivity.",

This is illustrated in the phylogram of the spike protein ( Figure 1D ) where samples with the insert generally group together in the upper clade of the tree, although other point mutations differed between the groups as well. The four-amino acid insert was located immediately adjacent to the proteolytic cleavage site of the spike protein, and in the S2 subunit of the spike protein which is responsible for fusion entry of the virus into the host cell [22] . The addition of multiple basic residues to this region creates a furin cleavage site that may serve as an alternative to trypsin-dependent cleavage of the spike protein [23] . Data from the 454 sequencing (mean 9316coverage) showed the insert was also present at subconsensus level in some of the cellpassaged samples (Table 1 ). An in-depth analysis using Illumina ultra-deep sequencing (mean 37,9016coverage) showed that the insert was present at very low numbers in unpassaged samples but was sometimes enriched during passage in cell culture indicating a possible role in cell culture adaptation.",

For example, the addition of a multibasic motif in the S2 subunit of the BCoV spike protein may create a trypsin-independent spike protein activation site as was recently proposed for SARS-CoV [23] . Watanabe et al. [30] generated a SARS-CoV construct with a furin site at the SARS-CoV S2 position (793-KPTKR-797 to 793-KRRKR-797) and have shown SARS-CoV S activation at the cell surface in a trypsin-independent manner. This work highlights the importance of residue R797 in the context of SARS-CoV infection. The position of SARS-CoV residue R797 corresponds to residue 918 in passaged BCoV, and multiple sequence alignments show that this arginine residue is extremely well-conserved across coronaviruses ( Figure 4) . Interestingly, the two arginines (R794 and R795) from the SARS-CoV construct overlap with arginines from the insert 912-SRRR-915 identified in passaged BCoV.",

Additionally, coronavirus fixation to heparan sulfate on the surface of macrophages has been associated with increased host inflammatory cytokine response via binding of Toll-like receptor 2 [35] . Other environmental factors such as the presence of trypsin-like enzymes in the bovine airway could also influence selective pressures on the frequency of genotypes lacking the insert [36] . Chouljenko et al. (1998) identified amino acid changes in the spike protein gene that differentiate respiratory BCoV (RBCV) strains from enteric BCoV (EBCV) strains, as well as amino acid changes that were ''virulence specific'', meaning that they were not detected in extensively lab-passaged strains that had an attenuated phenotype in bovine infections [37] . Our data show 10 of the 13 RBCV-specific changes present in the UP group samples but not the P group samples (Table S5) . UP group amino acid changes also correlated with all 7 amino acid changes considered ''virulence markers'' by Chouljenko et al. (1998) . Similarly, 8 of the 10 changes identified in a study by Zhang et al., (1991) as being associated with virulence were present in the UP group but not in the P group [38] . Six of these changes are nonconservative and all of these were reproduced in our data. These results indicate that laboratory passage causes predictable changes in the amino acid sequence, although the rate of change observed in the consensus sequence differs according to cell type and individual sample.",

In particular, amino acid change from Ser in the UP group to Ala in the P group was observed at amino acid 769 which is directly adjacent to the spike protein proteolytic cleavage site. A serine at this site has been hypothesized to be associated with cell fusion [37] , and our data indicate loss of the serine is associated with gain of the positively-charged insert in the S2 subunit of the spike protein. Another region immediately upstream of the insert (899-907) has been suggested to be a fusogenic domain by Parker et al. [22] . Interestingly there is a nonconservative amino acid change in this sequence from a nonpolar amino acid, Ala in Parker et al. (1990) and Gly in Chouljenko et al. (1998) and P group, to an acidic amino acid, Asp, in our UP group. This region is composed almost entirely of nonpolar amino acids and the addition of a charged residue may influence function. Another mutation occurred at amino acid 1030 which is part of the heptad repeat, a domain associated with class I fusion proteins and host range [39] , in this case a Gly in the UP group was replaced with an Asp in the P group. Ultimately, the role of these mutations in viral phenotype will need to be confirmed using reverse genetics.",

The identification of variants through deep sequencing of multiple BCoV samples points to the RNA virus' relatively high mutation rate. However, the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance, leaving open the question of their functional significance. Comparing consensus point mutations with their variant counterparts was used as a way to find variants with greater potential for functional significance. Our results showed that rather than de novo mutation being the driver of genetic change at the consensus population level, selection of preexisting mutations was evident in the majority of cases. Presumably with a sufficiently large population size and extended evolution, novel mutation becomes a bigger factor. The results here illustrate that introduction of novel mutations is a non-trivial process. Moreover, the results indicate the importance of identifying the variants in the population as a potential key piece of information in assessing how a viral isolate would most likely adapt genetically to a new host environment.",

To further avoid miscalls from misalignment, the adjacent bases in the read (+/21) must agree with the consensus sequence thus filtering out adjacent variant mutations. These rules eliminated a large percentage of the erroneous variant calls in the control sequences. Thus, rather than relying on a uniform observed error rate covering all positions in the control, we used the average per position, per base call error rate restricted to the cases where variant base calls were identified. The reasoning was that an alternative approach would lead to an artificial lowering of the error rate that includes cases where no variant base calls were observed. This led to an observed per genome position, per base call conditional error rate of 0.001, which reflects the average percentage of reads reporting an erroneous sub-consensus base call at each position in the genome.",

This disagreement between overlapping read pairs was used to correlate mismatch rates and the sequencer generated quality scores. A cutoff of Q30 was selected as the minimum base call quality score, which limits the mismatch error rate, while maintaining high amounts of sequencer coverage. Only base calls supported by both read pairs with the minimum quality score were used to infer an affective erorr rate in the control sequence, which was found to be 0.0005. This rate is the maximal percentage of reads that were observed to disagree at any position in the control. As with the 454 data, this error rate was used as input to the Binomial significance test to determine the minimum number of reads needed to separate sequencing error from true genetic variation.",

Across all 30 samples, 12,159 unique bases were sequenced, covering nsp1, nsp2, nsp3 and spike proteins between positions 2647 and 27809 on a reference genome, GenBank accession number NC_003045. Average coverage at the four protein regions are 5316, 25356, 5886 and 6236. The standard deviations of coverage at these four protein regions are 2106, 5876, 1086 and 2706. Hence, coverage at the nsp2 genome was both highest and most variable among the four proteins. Four of the 30 samples were also sequenced using Illumina to obtain deeper coverage and clarify differences with the 454 samples. Table S3 summarizes the counts of variants detected and the average per base read coverage in each sample, and includes the number of genome positions with 506coverage or greater, which was used as the minimum coverage cutoff for consensus base calls. Primer regions were excluded to avoid false positive variant calls from non-specific primer binding. An average of 10.7 kb consensus sequence was recovered.

The genetic changes that occurred in the #27 and #59 derived samples showed a less clear pattern since only a subset of samples acquired NEB strain SNPs as the consensus. We checked if the lack of NEB variants in unpassaged sample #59 was an anomaly by comparing the variant pools in its passaged descendants to the NEB SNPs. There indeed was a large increase in NEB strain SNPs existing as variants in the passaged descendants of #59 compared to the parent sample, suggesting these SNPs were either independently acquired after a single cell passage or were undetected by sequencing of the original unpassaged sample.
