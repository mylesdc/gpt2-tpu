We analyze these data, in conjunction with a comprehensive collection of flavivirus genomes, to characterize flavivirus evolutionary and biogeographic history in unprecedented detail and breadth. Based on the presumed introduction of yellow fever virus into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, we extrapolated a timescale for a relevant subset of flaviviruses whose evolutionary history, shows that different Culex-spp. associated flaviviruses have been introduced from the Old World to the New World on at least five separate occasions, with 2 different sets of factors likely to have contributed to the dispersal of the different viruses. We also discuss the significance of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in a central region of the polyprotein open reading frame in some mosquito-associated flaviviruses.",

As a result, it has not yet proven possible to resolve the issue that phylogenies based on complete genomes and, separately, the NS3 gene show different branching characteristics from those based on the NS5 gene, despite a lack of evidence for recombination within the respective data sets [10, 11, 25] . In this manuscript we report the genomic sequences of fourteen flaviviruses, for which previously only limited data were available. Based on these more comprehensive datasets, we attempt to resolve hitherto unanswered questions relating to the flaviviruses, and explore frame shift characteristics. Additionally, we identify viruses that appear to have been introduced from the Old World into the New World, estimate the likely times prior to the present that these introductions occurred, and discuss factors that probably contributed to the global dispersal of these viruses.

The divergence of the South American YFV from the African YFV strains represents the upper boundary for the introduction. Therefore, this node is assumed to be younger than 449 years. The common ancestor of all South American YFV strains represents the lower boundary for the slave trade introduction, and this node is therefore assumed to be older than 150 years. Given the long evolutionary time-scale and the fact that we performed our analysis at the amino acid level to allow the estimation of relatively deeper divergence times, instead of resorting to potentially saturated nucleotides, and to avoid a potential disconnect between short-term and long-term evolutionary rates [46] , we did not consider sampling time differences when estimating the timed history.",

According to the 9 th report of the ICTV [7] SOKV is a member of the Entebbe bat virus group, and appears to be a strain of the species ENTV. Entebbe bat virus is an African virus isolated from the insectivorous migratory bat species Tadarida (Chaerephon) limbata. It therefore seems reasonable to propose that SOKV probably emerged in Africa and dispersed to Asia via transmission across areas of overlapping bat habitats. Importantly, ENTV and SOKV have been shown to replicate in C6/36 mosquito cells in vitro [54] whereas the recognised NKV SL that form a genetically distant clade (Rio bravo [RBV], Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus [MMLV], etc.) do not replicate in mosquito cells [55] . This observation together with the phylogenetic position of these viruses in the MBFV clade is consistent with the idea that the transmission or maintenance cycles of YOKV, ENTV and SOKV (or ancestral representatives of these viruses), may have involved mosquitoes in the past.",

Moreover, the branching pattern of the tree implies that they emerged after the Aedes spp.-associated virus lineage but before the Culex spp.-associated virus lineage. Currently, they sit in the major clade of Aedesassociated viruses and represent an integral part of the evolutionary continuum amongst the MBFVs. These two groups of Eurasian viruses, containing LAMV, ILOV, DGV and CHAOV and the African virus group containing BJV and NOUV, appear to replicate only in mosquito cells, possibly with transitory replication in vertebrate cell lines [13, 57] . This is compatible with 2 independent events during which these MBFVs lost their ability to infect vertebrate cells. Recently, Nanay virus was isolated from Culex ocossa in Peru [59] . This virus was only partially sequenced in the E and NS5 gene but it seems to be closely related to NOUV, leaving the question of a potentially more widespread dispersal of this new ISFV-like virus in the NW. This is not surprising, in view of other papers which reported the widespread distribution of ISFV and the huge extent of undersampling.",

With the addition of recent discoveries such as Nakiwogo virus (NAKV) isolated from Mansonia [20] and Palm Creek virus (PCV) isolated from Coquillettidia [77] the ISFV SL group is becoming increasingly complex. Indeed the phylogeny now shows a potential third and/or fourth sub-group that includes NAKV and PCV. This is not surprising considering that the likely mosquito vectors of the two viruses, Coquillettidia and Mansonia spp., are considered by morphological data to be sister groups (Harbach & Kitching, 1998) . Also, these viruses are significantly undersampled and more vector distribution studies and virus discovery would help to clarify their phylogenetic status.",

Time-calibration for the tree, was based on the principle that YFV was introduced from the Old World into the New World during the slave-trade [12, 44, 45] . Although this provides only a single calibration point in the evolutionary history, it allows us to position other relative divergence times (Fig. 2) .

The shipping routes included stopovers in Africa, during which KUNV, or an ancestral lineage, could have gained access to the ships via infected mosquitoes. The virus could then have been carried from Africa to Australia in these mosquitoes on the ships that transported the British emigrants.",

In common with the arboviruses, there are distinct lineages in the OW and NW (coloured black and red respectively). The TMRCA of the OW NKV, Apoi virus (APOIV), which was isolated from rodents in Japan, pre-dates all the other recognised NKV SL , and the MRCA of this lineage diverged to produce descendant NKV and arthropod-borne virus lineages. This leaves open the possibility that the association of flaviviruses with tick and mosquito vectors may have been an acquired trait from a non-vectored ancestral virus [25] . Nodes N and O indicate that the NKVs were introduced to the NW on at least two independent occasions. Based on the TMRCA predictions, the NKV diverged over a period of 4000 to 14,000 years ago. It has been suggested (Varelas-Wesley & Calisher, 1982) that these NKVs could have been introduced into the Americas during the Miocene/Pliocene period, possibly by migrating rodents and/or bats. This idea is consistent with the TMRCA predictions presented in Fig. 2 . Nevertheless, the alternative possibility that these NW viruses emerged in the OW and were introduced more recently via rodents into the NW, following the development of trading via ships between the OW and the NW should not be ruled out. Two African viruses Dakar Bat and Bukulasa bat virus are not included in this analysis as only partial sequences for these viruses are currently available.",

Where functionally utilized, this is referred to as programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF). The eukaryotic-1 frameshift site typically consists of a 'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence fitting the consensus motif X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX represents any three identical nucleotides; YYY represents AAA or UUU; Z represents A, C or U; and underscores separate zero-frame codons. In the tandem slippage model, the P-site anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX, whereas the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY, thus allowing for perfect repairing except at the wobble position. Certain deviations from the canonical XXX of the slippery site are tolerated in the P-site, including UCC in some members of the JEV serogroup, GGU in cardioviruses and some luteoviruses, GUU in equine arteritis virus (family Arteriviridae), and GGA in many ISFVs besides insect nidoviruses of the family Mesoniviridae and some umbraviruses and dianthoviruses. The efficiency of frameshifting depends on the identity of the slippery site nucleotides but is typically less than 1% in the absence of additional stimulatory elements. Thus, most known instances of eukaryotic-1 frameshifting are stimulated (typically to a level between 1% and 50%) by the presence of a 3' stable RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or stem-loop, that is separated from the slippery heptanucleotide by a 'spacer' region of 5-9 nt.",

In these viruses, -1 PRF occurs (with an estimated efficiency of 20-50%) when ribosomes are positioned on the codons encoding the 8th and 9th amino acids of NS2A. When PRF occurs, ribosomes translate a 43codon ORF in the-1 reading frame relative to the polyprotein ORF and then terminate. The resulting 52 amino acid 'transframe' polypeptide is not cleaved at the NS1|NS2A cleavage site and thus frameshifting results in the production of a C-terminally extended version of NS1, known as NS1'. Our study extends the range of viruses that possess this frameshift site to include CPCV, YAOV and KOUV. The overlapping ORF displayed a constant length (43 codons) for all viruses within the JEV serogroup, with the exception of SLEV which lacks the frameshift site.",

Also these analyses do not yet provide statistically useful results for all flavivirus clades (e.g. where there is insufficient sequence divergence within a clade and too much sequence divergence between phylogenetically adjacent clades to observe the effects of purifying selection at synonymous sites).",

However, the recent discovery of several new viruses included in the ISFV-like group, now reveals the possibility of two potentially new virus groups, viz., the Phylogeny of Flaviviruses LAMV group and the NOUV group. They are geographically very widely dispersed but the mechanisms for their dispersal are unknown. Currently exclusively OW viruses found in Africa, Europe or Asia have been characterised. However, with the addition of the newly isolated Nanay virus in Peru [59] , which is closely related to NOUV, the ISFV-like group now seems to extend to the NW and this will need to be re-visited when genomic sequences of NW isolates become available.",

YOKV and SOKV were both isolated in Asia but appear to have their ancestral roots in Africa, as do many of the related viruses in the EHV group. Thus, flaviviruses seem able to lose or acquire a variety of genetic traits as illustrated by acquisition of the requirement for a tick or mosquito vector and therefore becoming arboviruses, loss of ability to infect vertebrate cells, exemplified by LAMV and NOUV, loss of the requirement for vector transmission illustrated by the ENTV group and originally proposed by Mattingly in 1960 [100] and supported by Kuno and Chang [101] , inability to infect vertebrate cells, as illustrated by the ISFVs and acquisition of a frameshift as typified by the JEV serogroup viruses (discussed in detail later).",

Based on the phylogenetic and TMRCA data, viruses within this group have been introduced to the NW on at least two separate occasions and these introductions may have occurred thousands of years ago. Estimations for the time of divergence between these OW and NW NKV SL ranged between 4000 to 14000 years ago (Fig. 2 nodes N and O) . Despite the recognised large errors in TMRCA estimates, they all pre-date, by thousands of years, the recognised commercial trading period across the Atlantic Ocean that commenced 400-500 years ago. Therefore, viruses could have dispersed to the NW from the OW thousands of years before transoceanic trading was taking place. The possible mechanisms of dispersal remain a mystery. It is now established that OW human populations (presumably of both Asian and European origin) became established in the Americas during the period of TMRCA estimates, and possibly even before these estimated times. The question arises, during such migrations is it likely that infected animals could have been transported (e.g., rodents). The arrival of viruses in the NW could alternatively have occurred via the gradual dispersal of OW rodents and migratory bats. On the other hand, these transoceanic dispersions might have occurred after the development of trading between the OW and the NW.",

Currently, at least 9 genetically distinguishable ISFVs have been isolated and their sequences determined. This group of mosquito-and potentially sandfly-borne viruses is an extremely genetically diverse group with a divergence of up to 61% at the amino acid level. This compares with the genetic distances between the three current genera in the family Flaviviridae. Moreover, they infect only invertebrate hosts and DNA forms of ISFV genomes are generated during infection of cell cultures [26] . Integrated DNA sequences have been identified in mosquito genomes and isolated DNA forms have been detected in field samples [18, 26, 102, 103] . Currently, there is no clear indication of the biological significance of these DNA forms amongst ISFVs. We therefore propose that the distinct differences of the ISFVs justify their inclusion as a separate genus in the family Flaviviridae. These viruses are also interesting because similar ISFVs have been isolated from mosquito species that inhabit different ecological niches, raising the question how might this occur? Possible mechanisms of virus transfer between mosquito species include the diffusion of viruses between larvae at sites shared by different mosquito species, or biting midges could become infected when taking blood meals from infected mosquitoes [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] and they could then act as vectors of the virus if they subsequently feed on different mosquito species.",

Based on this assumption, we estimated divergence times and ancestral OW/NW relationships to provide a deeper understanding of the evolution and dispersal patterns of flaviviruses. Since virus evolution characterised by lineage-specific and non-constant substitution rates (Pettersson 2014) , it would be unwise to assert that a single calibration point can produce precise estimates for both short/recent times, and long/deep times. Not surprisingly, our estimates, based on a calibration point from the recent historical period and involving mosquito-borne viruses, differ significantly from those of Pettersson and Omarwhose calibration point was derived from a more distant historical time period and involved a tick-borne virus. An important consequence of the latter calibration is the hypothetical origin of mosquito-borne flavivirus diversification during the last glaciation period, whilst the former calibration suggests that the major part of mosquito-borne flavivirus diversification which involves human epidemiology, occurred after the end of the most recent major Ice Age [12] .",

All historical and phylogenetic data are consistent with the concept that there was a recent period of 400 to 500 years during which African viruses such as YFV and DENV were transported on slave and commercial ships across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas, [12, 44, 45, 78, 111, 112] which is why we base our estimates on this for the divergence time estimation. This \"recent evolutionary period\" includes viruses that have gradually emerged during the past few decades viruses (e.g., WNV, HIV, SARS, CoV, HepC virus, USUV, MERS CoV) and are still being dispersed via human movement and commercial transportation.",

            "text": "Based on published estimates for the times of divergence in the tree [9, 44, 113, 114] it also appears that these introductions to the New World may have occurred gradually over the period of time corresponding to the movement of humans from Africa to the New World during the four or five hundred years of the Slave trade. Support for the concept that DENV can be included with YFV also comes from the known presence of the American genotype dengue viruses in South America that have African ancestral lineages. These viruses were presumably also transported to the Americas over the same range of time as the introduction of yellow fever viruses [12] and even more recently as slave trading was finally abolished [115] . It has been recorded that febrile syndromes and even haemorrhagic fever, clinically compatible with dengue fever, were diagnosed clinically in southern parts of North America over a long period of time [111, 116, 117] . The most recent and persuasive example of an OW introduction to the NW was the spectacular appearance of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York in August 1999 [118] . Since the first cases of WNV encephalitis in birds and humans were discovered in the area of the Bronx zoo and relatively close to a major international airport, it is considered possible that WNV was inadvertently introduced into North America either via infected birds or mosquitoes transported to the New York area by air transport [12, 65, 119] . Fig. 2 also identifies 4 examples of other flaviviruses (CPCV-node B; SLEV-node C; ILHV group-node C; AROAV group-node E) that have been introduced from the OW to the NW. However, the TMRCA for these introduced viruses predates the period of slave trading, by thousands of years and will be referred to as \"ancient period\" viruses.",

The tree shows that introductions to the NW were multiple and independent. The first introduction is represented in Fig. 2 -node E for the AROAV group. Except for BSQV, these viruses have only been isolated from rodents. The TMRCA for this node is 5700 to 13000 years ago. An ancestral virus present in the OW could have been introduced into the NW via rodents or migratory birds and then adapted to other species such as rodents. Other predicted introductions are presented in Fig. 2 nodes-C, B and D for ILHV/ROCV, SLEV and CPCV. These viruses are bird associated and may therefore have been introduced via migratory birds or bats. However, if birds were a major cause of virus introduction into the NW, it seems surprising that viruses such as WNV have only been successfully introduced once, as suggested by the numerous phylogenetic analyses of many North America WNV isolates [81, 120, 121] . Additionally, Nanay virus isolated in Culex mosquitoes in Peru might represent another example of potential virus introduction from the OW to the NW.",

However, the sequences of CPCV, YAOV and KOUV had not been determined when this conclusion was reached. We now show that the frameshift site is also conserved in these newly sequenced viruses. Thus, the ability to produce NS1' via PRF appears to have been acquired as a genetic trait after the branching point which separates the New World virus SLEV (Fig. 2 node C) from another New World virus (CPCV) and the remaining Old World JEV serocomplex viruses (Fig. 2-node B) .",

Potential frameshift sites have also been bioinformatically predicted for NOUV, CHAOV, LAMV and KEDV ; ILOV and DGV [52] ; and SEPV and WESSV (see above). These potential frameshift sites are also located within the genomic region encoding NS2A/NS2B. Thus, the acquisition of PRF at internal regions of the polyprotein ORF appears to be a common (though not ubiquitous) theme of flavivirus evolution. Aside from the ability to produce new functional proteins, where PRF is efficient, it may also play a role in downregulating production of the 3'-encoded replicative proteins and more quickly recycling the host cell translational machinery for increased production of the 5'-encoded structural proteins.",

We have also demonstrated that similar introductions have occurred eastwards from Africa to Australia, again over two distinct time periods. Clearly there have been far more introductory movements of flaviviruses from one part of the world to another than we have described here. However, more data for a larger number of samples will be required before we can draw specific and more detailed conclusions. Finally, in the context of flavivirus evolution and dispersal, we have extended our current understanding of frameshifting amongst the flaviviruses.",

Alignments of 249 JEV serogroup, 49 NTAV/TMUV clade, 89 DENV, 6 DGV/LAMV clade and 29 CxFV/QBV clade polyprotein ORF sequences were analyzed for synonymous site variability as decribed previously(Firth et al.,  2011 PMID 21525127). The accession numbers of all sequences used in the analysis are available on request. Red lines indicate the probability (p-value) of obtaining not more than the observed number of synonymous substitutions, in a 25-codon sliding window, under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites. Dashed grey lines indicate an approximate 5% false positive threshold after correcting for multiple tests (i.e.~136 x 25-codon windows in the~3400-codon polyprotein ORF). Statistically significant peaks in synonymous site conservation are indicative of overlapping functional elements, either coding or non-coding. Genome maps are shown for each clade. UTR lengths may be uncertain for less well-studied clades. Known and predicted overlapping ORFs accessed via-1 PRF are shown in pink. The predicted overlapping ORF in the DGV/LAMV clade is much shorter in DGV than in other members of the clade; the long form of the ORF is indicated. Note that p-values can not be directly compared between different clades because the statistical significance (i.e. p-value) of observed reductions in synonymous site variabilty depends on the diversity of the specific sequence alignment being analyzed.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0117849.g004 Phylogeny of Flaviviruses PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0117849 February 26, 2015",
