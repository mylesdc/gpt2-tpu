Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional study, involving 27 referral maternity hospitals in five Brazilian regions. Cases were identified in a prospective surveillance by using the WHO standardized criteria for potentially life-threatening conditions (PLTC) and maternal near miss (MNM). Women with severe complications from respiratory disease identified as suspected or confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza or respiratory failure were compared to those with other causes of severe morbidity. A review of suspected H1N1 influenza cases classified women as non-tested, tested positive and tested negative, comparing their outcomes. Factors associated with severe maternal outcome (SMO = MNM + MD) were assessed in both groups, in comparison to PLTC, using PR and 95 % CI adjusted for design effect of cluster sampling. Results: Among 9555 cases of severe maternal morbidity, 485 (5 %) had respiratory disease. Respiratory disease occurred in one-quarter of MNM cases and two-thirds of MD. H1N1 virus was suspected in 206 cases with respiratory illness. Around 60 % of these women were tested, yielding 49 confirmed cases. Confirmed H1N1 influenza cases had worse adverse outcomes (MNM:MD ratio < 1 (0.9:1), compared to 12:1 in cases due to other causes), and a mortality index > 50 %, in comparison to 7.4 % in other causes of severe maternal morbidity. Delay in medical care was associated with SMO in all cases considered, with a two-fold increased risk among respiratory disease patients. Perinatal outcome was worse in cases complicated by respiratory disease, with increased prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight and Apgar score < 7. Conclusions: Respiratory disease, especially considering the influenza season, is a very severe cause of maternal near miss and death. Increased awareness about this condition, preventive vaccination during pregnancy, early diagnosis and treatment are required to improve maternal health.",

Maternal near miss (MNM) is any situation in which a woman survives a very severe complication with proven organ dysfunction, during pregnancy or puerperium (42 days after childbirth), with at least one of the following criteria: clinical (e.g., shock or clotting disorder), laboratory (lactate > 5, PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg) or management (hysterectomy due to infection or hemorrhage and blood transfusion \u2265 5 units of packed red blood cells).

Subsequently, the coordinating team of the study performed random reviews of manual and electronic forms for data consistency in visits to monitor the centers' performance. Periodically, review of the electronic system was carried out to check for data inconsistency, along with systematic case review. Some reported conditions were delay or substandard care, which had been previously reported [21] . Reasons for the delay in treatment were the woman or family member (including delay in identifying the condition, seeking care and refusing to accept treatment), health service (difficulties in obtaining equipment or medical supplies) or health professional (delays in identifying the correct diagnosis and providing appropriate patient treatment). Sample size was determined by the prevalence of about 8 maternal near miss cases per 1000 births and a maternal mortality ratio of 140/100,000 live-born infants (95 % confidence interval).

Brazil followed these recommendations and launched a national vaccination campaign before the winter of 2010, targeted at high-risk groups, including pregnancy. The vaccine was available in all public health facilities, at no cost for the patient and reached very high coverage (around 80 %), most likely due to the long term experience in the National Immunization Program for Children and due to the awareness about the severity of the disease, among health professionals and among the society [23] . We cannot evaluate the impact of those preventive measures in our study, since we lack information on the total number of cases and specific data on individual history of vaccination or treatment, however, from our Fig. 2 , we can see on the linear traces that there is a trend towards decrease in numbers of severe cases, through time, especially after vaccination. Clinical evaluation should determine treatment, in order to ensure timely and effective interventions. In our study, around 60 % of suspected cases of H1N1 influenza A virus were tested. In accordance with previous reports, symptoms were more severe in positive cases [24] .

Recent onset of fever and respiratory symptoms, including cough is the clinical definition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. In the setting of an epidemic, this definition is very useful to raise awareness and ensure prompt treatment, as soon as a suspected case is identified [30] . ARDS is another acronym for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a different condition that represents hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral radiographic opacities, without congestive heart failure. This diagnosis depends on oxygenation deficit measurements and chest imaging [31, 32] .",

Drug-related severe respiratory complications can occur, resulting from parenchymal (infectious and non-infectious pneumonitis, aspiration-related events, hemorrhage, pulmonary edema and pneumothorax), pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infection, hemorrhage, and vasoconstriction) or airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage) abnormalities. Diabetes was also associated with an increased risk of SMO among cases complicated by severe respiratory disease. Previous studies had demonstrated this fact, even in the Brazilian population. Diabetes is one of the main risk factors for death from H1N1 influenza A [35] virus infection. Medical history, including known factors related to worse outcomes should be highlighted and the awareness among patients and health professionals towards targeted cases could impact in the final outcome.",
