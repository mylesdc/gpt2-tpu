            "text": "Mastadenovirus have been isolated from various bat species, some of them displaying a wide host range in cell culture. In this study, we isolated two BtAdVs from Japanese wild microbats. While one isolate was classified as Bat mastadenovirus A, the other was phylogenetically independent of other BtAdVs. It was rather related to, but serologically different from, canine adenoviruses. We propose that the latter, isolated from Asian parti-colored bat, should be assigned to a novel species of Bat mastadenovirus. Both isolates replicated in various mammalian cell lines, implying their wide cell tropism. To gain insight into cell tropism of these BtAdVs, we investigated the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) for virus entry to the cells. We prepared CXADRknockout canine kidney cells and found that replication of BtAdVs was significantly hampered in these cells. For confirmation, their replication in canine CXADR-addback cells was rescued to the levels with the original cells. We also found that viral replication was corrected in human or bat CXADR-transduced cells to similar levels as in canine CXADR-addback cells. These results suggest that BtAdVs were able to use several mammalian-derived CXADRs as entry factors.",

Several reports suggest that BtAdVs have a broad host range in cell culture 10, 12, 14 . Their molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. The receptor on the cell surface is one of the major viral host range determinants [17] [18] [19] . Although several molecules have been reported as adenovirus receptors [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , majority of adenoviruses, including CAdV2, use coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptors (CXADR or CAR) via their fiber proteins [25] [26] [27] . The CXADR is a 46-kDa type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular region composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains 26 , having a major role in forming cellular tight junctions 28 . CXADR homologs are conserved in vertebrates such as human, mice, rats, dogs, bats, and zebrafish 29 . Therefore, it is possible that BtAdVs may use CXADR as a functional receptor to infect various cell cultures.",

The captured bats were classified into 10 species by their morphological features and, in some cases, by cytochrome b gene sequencing. To isolate viruses, we inoculated antibiotics-treated fecal samples into several cell lines of different animal origins. Among them, we observed extensive CPE such as cell rounding, exfoliation, and death in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, following inoculation with samples from Myotis macrodactylus and Vesperitilio sinensis microbats (Fig. S1 ). These two isolates were identified as having less than 100 nm particle size through a membrane filtration test, resistant to chloroform treatment, and susceptible to a pyrimidine analog 5-iodo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine. Moreover, we observed adenovirus-like particles by transmission electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 1B) . We strongly presume from these data that these two isolates were adenoviruses.",

BLASTn analysis of nucleotide sequence of penton gene indicated that the virus from M. macrodactylus (referred as BtAdV-Mm32) showed the highest identity (99%) to BtAdV in Bat mastadenovirus A, which had been isolated from Myotis ricketti bats in China 12 . On the other hand, the virus from V. sinensis (referred as BtAdV-Vs9) showed the highest identity (75%) to CAdV2 in Canine mastadenovirus A. For confirmation, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the complete genome sequences ( Fig. 2A , Supplementary Data 1) or the DNA polymerase amino acid sequences (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Data 2) . Both of our isolates belonged to BtAdV group 1 in the genus Mastadenovirus. Species demarcation in the genus Mastadenovirus is determined by a criterion that there is a 15% or more difference in the phylogenetic distance, based on distance matrix analysis of the DNA polymerase amino acid sequence, as described by the ICTV (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ ictv_9th_report/dsdna-viruses-2011/w/dsdna_viruses/93/adenoviridae). The phylogenetic distances between BtAdV-Vs9 and the viruses in group 1 species such as Bat mastadenovirus A, B, G, and CAdV1/2 in Canine mastadenovirus A were 22.0%, 23.9%, 19.8%, and 22.4/20.9%, respectively.

The amino acid sequence identities of our isolates with those of other bat or canine adenoviruses in each ORF have been shown (Tables S2 and S3 ). All deduced amino acid sequences of BtAdV-Mm32 showed the highest identity (95%-100%) to those of Bat mastadenovirus A in all ORFs (Table S2) , confirming that the virus should be classified into this species. In contrast, BtAdV-Vs9 showed low sequence identities in most ORFs of any other BtAdVs (21-87% identity) and CAdVs (42-86% identity) (Table S3 ).

Sera collected from orally-inoculated mice at 21 days post-inoculation were negative for neutralization antibodies. In contrast, sera collected from intranasally-inoculated mice became antibody-positive in the neutralization test; the antibody titers were 320, 160, and 320 in three mice infected with Mm32 and 20, 160, and 80 in three mice infected with Vs9, respectively. These data indicated that our BtAdV isolates were capable of infecting mice. None of the mice showed appreciable disease signs and died when intranasally-inoculated during the course of infection. However, the body weight gain of the BtAdV-Vs9-infected mice was significantly lower than that of mock-infected mice (Fig. 3) . Additionally, we detected viral DNAs in the lung and intestine of 83% of sacrificed mice at 21 days post-infection with both viruses.

In the PRNT, we confirmed that each antiserum neutralized homologous virus with high titers and that CAdV1 and CAdV2 cross-neutralized each other as previously reported 30 (Fig. 4A) . However, no cross-neutralization was observed between the two BtAdVs and between BtAdVs and CAdVs. Contrastingly, in the IFA, anti-BtAdV-Mm32 and anti-CAdV1 sera showed strong reaction to heterologous as well as homologous viruses, whereas anti-BtAdV-Vs9 and anti-CAdV2 sera showed faint reaction to heterologous viruses compared to homologous viruses (Fig. 4B ).

One isolate, BtAdV-Mm32, was phylogenetically closely related to a virus in species Bat mastadenovirus A (98% genome identity), which had been isolated from Chinese bats (Fig. 2) . Both viruses were derived from Myotis bats, M. macrodactylus (Fig. S1 ) and M. ricketti, distribution areas of these two species did not overlap. Since Myotis bats belong to a highly species-rich genus, which inhabit across the world 32 , similar BtAdVs might be widely distributed on earth. Moreover, M. macrodactylus often forms mixed colonies with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Murina hilgendorfi, or Miniopterus fuliginosus in Japan. Although we did not detect viruses in these bat species, mode of their living may correlate to viral spread among bat colonies. Further studies using a large number of samples are expected to clarify bat-to-bat transmission of BtAdVs.",

Sometimes, V. sinensis makes a very long-distance flight (more than 300 km). Actually, during preparation of this manuscript, we successfully isolated a virus very closely-related to BtAd-Vs9 from the same bat species captured in Aomori prefecture, approximately 800 km far from the sampling site of BtAdV-Vs9 (our unpublished data). BtAdV-Vs9-related viruses are thus likely to be distributed in broad geographical areas of Japan and East Asia.",

However, considerable levels of viral replication were still observed in CXADR-KO cells (Fig. 6D) . These data suggest the presence of multiple functional receptors in MDCK cells for BtAdVs and CAdVs. The studies with human adenoviruses have revealed the presence of alternative receptors, such as integrins or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in addition to CXADRs 33, 34 . Notably, group 2 and 3 BtAdVs possess integrin binding RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs in penton base proteins, which recognize integrins \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 33 . Contrastingly, while Since BtAdVs, including our isolates, infect a broad range of mammalian cell lines (Fig. 5) , they have a potential for interspecies transmission. The receptors are one of the important determinants of viral host range (e.g. linkage formed between sialic acid and galactose on the terminus of sugar chain determines host specificity for influenza A virus) 17 . Our isolates possessed 4 out of 5 conserved amino acid residues in fiber proteins that are responsible for interaction with CXADR 36 (Table 1 ) and may use several mammalian-derived CXADRs as their functional receptors. This notion suggests that BtAdVs may already have a potential to infect various mammals, including humans. Further characterization of BtAdVs is required to better understand their zoonotic potential and risk assessment on public health concern. Methods Bat samples. All bats were captured using a harp trap with the permission from the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and each of the local governments from 2015 to 2016. Species of bats which were captured were mainly determined morphologically or in part genetically by sequencing the cytochrome b gene 37 from intestinal cell debris contained in their fecal samples. To obtain fresh feces, captured bats were kept in a plastic pouch for 1 h, their feces were collected with a sterilized cotton bud and transferred to 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin, and 2 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin followed by transportation in dry ice.",

The numbers of BtAdV as well as CAdV antigen-positive cells were much lower in KO than in WT cells(Fig. 6B,C), suggesting that attachment and entry of both viruses to the cells were hampered by knocking out the cCXADR. To totally evaluate viral growth in cCXADR-KO cells, we determined growth kinetics of BtAdVs or CAdVs(Fig. 6D). Viral titers of all the viruses were lower in KO than in WT cells at each time-point post-infection.
