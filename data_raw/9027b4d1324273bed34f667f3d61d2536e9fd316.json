Analysis on the dynamic changes of clinical, laboratory, and immunological abnormalities associated with SFTS in a concurrent study is lacking. Thirty-three SFTS patients were admitted to Jiangsu People's Hospital, Nanjing, China, and diagnosis was made based on the clinical symptoms and positive viral RNA detected by RT-PCR. Four patients deceased and twenty-nine survived. Blood samples were collected every other day between Day 5 and Day 15 from the onset of fever. Samples from healthy volunteers were used as normal controls. Peak viral RNA load, serum enzymes, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly higher in deceased patients compared to survivors. Viral load, serum enzymes, and cytokines declined in survivors within 2 weeks from onset of fever. CD69+ T cells were elevated early after infection while HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells were elevated during the recovery phase of those who survived. High level SFTSV viral load was concurrently observed with reduced PLT, elevated serum enzymes, elevated pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of CD69+ T cells. The degree and pattern of changes in these parameters may indicate the clinical outcome in SFTSV-infected patients.",

The causative agent of this illness, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), was identified as a novel tickborne Bunynavirus in genus Phlebovirus; it is also named Huaiyangshan virus, since the original cases were identified in the Huaiyangshan Mountains in 2009 [1, 6, 7] . It was reported that SFTSV can be transmitted in several ways: 1) patients can be infected through a tick bite; the virus has been detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks [1, 7] and/or 2) through personto-person transmission via contact with blood from patients with SFTS [8] . Sporadic and clustered SFTS endemics have been documented in at least six provinces in Northeastern, Eastern, and Central China since 2009 [1, 3, 9] .",

A high mortality rate (ranging from 12%-30%) has been reported for SFTSV-infected patients [1, 6, 9] . The exact mechanism of SFTSV pathogenesis remains unclear but it is generally suspected that immunopathology plays a key role [10, 11] . As with other viral infections, immune activation and exaggerated cytokine production in the form of cytokine storm can potentially drive the SFTS disease process. Several studies reported that SFTSV infection could lead to elevated levels of serum cytokines, which might contribute to disease severity and clinical outcome [6, 12, 13] . In separate reports it was shown that the viral infection induced CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cell population changes [11, 14] . However, almost all of the previous reports showed data collected at one or two time points of the disease process rather than determining dynamic changes in key lab test results and immunological markers incurred during the critical clinical period shortly after infection.",

These patients share the similar clinic manifestations of SFTS, including acute fever (.38uC), weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, as well as disturbance of consciousness, ecchymosis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage for those in critical condition (Table 1) , as well as the hallmark thrombocytopenia (platelet count ,4610 9 /L). At admission, all patients enrolled in this study had confirmed positive SFTSV in blood samples determined by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with designated primers for SFTSV L, M, S genes. During hospitalization, all patients received similar treatment based on guidelines from the Chinese Ministry of Health [15] . Four died within 1-3 days after admission (7-9 days after onset of fever) and 29 patients recovered from the illness. The length between symptom onset to admission did not contribute to the mortality as those deceased were admitted on Day 7 of symptom onset while the median time of admission for those who survived was 6 days (range 3-10 days) ( Table 1 ). There was no gender bias for the deceased (2 males/2 females) and survivors (14 males/16 females) patients. On the other hand, the median age of the deceased patients (70 years) was notably older than the median age of survivors (59 years), but not statistically significant due to a small sample size (Table 1) . While all patients had easily detectable SFTSV in their blood, SFTSV viral load among survivors peaked shortly after admission (within 7-11 days of symptom onset) and then dropped rapidly during the remaining period of the study (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, three out of four deceased patients who were admitted on Day 7 of disease onset died within three days of admission with much higher levels of viral load while one of the deceased patients had similar levels of viral load to those who survived (Fig. 1A) . When the viral loads on Day 9 for both groups were compared, the mean log viral load for the deceased patients (8.85, range 6.67-9.76) was about 1000 fold higher than the mean log viral load in the survivors (5.92, range 2.66-7.94) (p,0.0001) (Fig. 1B) .",

In contrast, the level of SFTSV viremia is correlated to disease severity with significantly higher levels in the deceased patients than in the survivors when measured on Days 7-9 after onset of fever. Viral loads gradually dropped among survivors during the recovery phase. The finding is consistent with other reports that the SFTSV viral load is related to disease severity [6] . SFTSV infection causes tissue injury and organ damage, which can lead to elevated serum enzymatic markers and death. In all SFTSV-infected patients, ALT, AST, LDH, and CK were all elevated above the normal range especially during the acute phase of the disease, and their peak levels in deceased patients were significantly higher than in survivors, which is similar to other reports [6, 14] [10]. On the other hand, our kinetics analysis discovered that ALT was the last one to come down while AST, LDH and CK started to decrease among survivors very early after their admission to the hospital. These lab tests may serve great value for the clinical prognosis of SFTSV-infected patients. The human immune system responds powerfully to a major viral infection such as SFTSV. Previous studies found that total CD3+ T cells and total CD4+ T cells were decreased in SFTSVinfected patients, more so during acute phase infection, in severe cases, and in those who eventually die from the disease [11] . At the same time, there is no significant change in CD8+ T cells [11, 14] . Because the measurement of serum cytokines in SFTSV-infected patients in previous studies actually showed increased levels consistent with a cytokine storm as expected in a typical major viral infection, the above data of total T cells was surprising. In the current study, change within subpopulations of T cells was investigated and profound T cell activation was discovered.",

This T cell subpopulation in survivors gradually decreased to normal levels and was comparable to healthy donors in 2 weeks.",

CTLA4 is a T-cell costimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells and transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells. HLA-DR and CTLA4 may serve as upregulation markers in the recovery phase and may have a role in checking and re-balancing the lymphocytes once the viral infection is under control. Taken together, our data imply that an increase inCD69+ T cells may be related to pathogenesis while a late increase in HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells may indicate the induction of protective immune responses.",

            "text": "As reported in SARS [17] and pandemic influenza cases [18, 19] , patients infected with SFTSV also mounted an exaggerated immune response; furthermore, cytokine storm (hypercytokinemia) was responsible for significant damage to body tissues and organs, potentially resulting in death. In our study, both proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IFN-c) and antiinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) were elevated in SFTSVinfected patients and levels were dramatically higher in the deceased patients, which is similar to reports by other groups [6, 10] . More significantly, IL-6 and IL-10 were persistently elevated in the deceased patients while levels trended down in survivors, indicating the possibility of using them as biomarkers to monitor the progression of the disease. Levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFa, and IL-17A were similar to normal healthy donors; this finding is somewhat different from previous reports showing that TNF-a was significantly elevated in SFTS-infected patients, especially deceased patients [6, 10] . It is not clear what may have contributed to this difference but timing of sample collection and different assay kits are potential factors influencing the final results of measurement. In conclusion, the current study identified concurrent patterns of dynamic changes for viral load, PLT, key serum enzymes, major T cell subsets and unique cytokines in SFTS patients, further extending our understanding of this high risk, emerging viral infection, which was discovered only a few years ago. Findings on the involvement of CD69+ as well as HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells in SFTSV infection will lead more targeted research on the mechanism of pathogenesis in the coming future.",
