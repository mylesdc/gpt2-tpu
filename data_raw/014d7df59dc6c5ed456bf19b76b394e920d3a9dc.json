Scotophilus bat CoV-512 demonstrates potential for cross-species transmission because its viral RNA and specific antibodies have been detected in three bat species of Taiwan. Understanding the cell tropism of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 is the first step for studying the mechanism of cross-species transmission. In this study, a lentivirus-based pseudovirus was produced using the spike (S) protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV as a surface protein to test the interaction between coronaviral S protein and its cell receptor on 11 different cells. Susceptible cells expressed red fluorescence protein (RFP) after the entry of RFP-bound green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 (RFP-Sco-S-eGFP) or RFP-SARS-S pseudovirus, and firefly luciferase (FLuc) activity expressed by cells infected with FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP or FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus was quantified. Scotophilus bat CoV-512 pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in Madin Darby dog kidney epithelial cells (MDCK), black flying fox brain cells (Pabr), and rat small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6). SARS-CoV pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK-293T), pig kidney epithelial cells (PK15), and MDCK cells. These findings demonstrated that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 had a broad host range for cross-species transmission like SARS-CoV.",

SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 gain cellular entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [9], whereas MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as its entry receptor [10] . The entry receptor is considered a hallmark of coronaviral cross-species transmissibility. SARS-related CoV isolated from Rhinolophus bats can use the ACE2 of humans, civets, and Rhinolophus bats as its cell receptor to infect cells originated from human and many other animal species [11] . Both MERS-CoV and bat CoV-HKU4 can use bat and human DPP4 to infect cells originating from humans, camels, bats, and other animal species [12, 13] and HCoV-NL63 can replicate in the lung cell line from tricolored bats [8] .",

A previous study detected Scotophilus bat CoV-512 in four different bat species along with Miniopterus bat CoV-1A and Rhinolophus SARS-related CoV in Taiwan through the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [14] . Antibodies specific to the nucleocapsid (N) protein fragments of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 were detected in serum collected from three bat species, namely Scotophilus kuhlii, Miniopterus fuliginosus, and Rhinolophus monoceros [15]. A close relationship and possible gene recombinants between Scotophilus bat CoV-512 and PEDV were observed through sequence alignments [14, 16] . The results of the cell entry assay also indicated that PEDV can infect cells originating from pigs (PK15 and ST), humans (Huh-7 and MRC5), monkeys (Vero) and Tadarida brasiliensis bats (Tb1-Lu) [17] . We selected Scotophilus bat CoV-512 as our study target because it demonstrates the potential of cross-species infection and may play a role in the emergence or transmission of PEDV. Both molecular and serological evidences proved that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 can infect multiple animal species [14, 15] . To investigate host tropisms contributing to cross-species transmission of Scotophilus bat CoV-512, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 in the envelope (Env) protein-defective, red fluorescence protein (RFP)-expression or luciferase (FLuc)-expression human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) backbone for performing a cell entry assay in 11 different cells from humans, bats, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and monkeys.",

HEK-293T cells were selected as they have been used for the production of pseudoviruses; additionally, several cell lines were selected because they were used for the isolation and maintenance of viruses in other studies, such as Vero and PK15 cells for PEDV [17] , MDCK cells for influenza viruses [18] , and Fcwf-4 cells for FCoV [19] . Given that CoVs tend to replicate in the epithelial cells of enteric and respiratory tracts, Caco-2 and IEC-6 were selected. MFK cells were selected because viral RNA and specific antibodies of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 were detected in Miniopterus fuliginosus. Pteropus bat-cell lines (Paki, Pabr, Palu) were selected as alternative bat cells for comparison. All the 11 tested cells were susceptible to the entry of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV pseudovirus in varying degrees. Scotophilus bat CoV-512 pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in MDCK, Pabr, and IEC-6 cells, followed by PK15, HEK-293T, Paki, Palu, Caco-2, MFK, Fcwf-4, and Vero cells. Notably, only MDCK, PK15, HEK-293T, and Fcwf-4 cells tested positive for APN, the proposed cell receptor for PEDV [20] . However, APN as a cell receptor of PEDV is not completely conclusive, and conflicting results have demonstrated blockage of PEDV infection by pAPN antibodies [20] , although soluble APN could not inhibit PEDV infection [21] . As porcine APN-knockout swine testis cells did not inhibit PEDV infection [21] and APN-knockout pigs are not resistant to PEDV infection [22] , APN may not be required for PEDV cell entry but it can promote the infectivity through aminopeptidase activity [23] . In this study, polybrene, trypsin or other proteases were not used for the pseudovirus entry assay; therefore, the cell entry of pseudovirus was determined by receptor recognition, implying that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 could enter susceptible cells via cell receptors other than APN.",

            "text": "The polyclonal antibody to human APN (Bioss) used in this study was produced in the rabbits inoculated with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated synthetic peptide derived from human APN. Its cross-reactivity was tested by Bioss company and it can cross-react to mouse and rat APN. We compared the sequences of APN from the animal species of the tested cells in this study (Figure 8) , the APN of Eastern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) had the closest phylogenetic relationship with pig (Sus scrofa) APN, followed by black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) APN. Interestingly, human APN had closer phylogenetic relationship with bat APN than dog and cat APN. Therefore, the negative IFA results to anti-APN antibody in Pabr cells from black flying fox and MFK cells from Eastern bent-winged bat could result from the lack of APN receptor but not from the lack of cross-reactivity of anti-APN antibody because MDCK cells from dogs and Fcwf-4 cells from cats showed strong positive IFA signals. There was no correlation between the phylogenetic relationship of APNs and the infectivity pattern of Scotophilus bat CoV-512. For ACE2, human ACE2 had the closest relationship to monkey ACE2, followed by rat, pig, bats, dogs, and cats ( Figure 8 ). The polyclonal antibody to human ACE2 provided by abcam company has cross-reactivity to ACE2 from cat, ferret, and macaque monkey. Interestingly, the phylogenetic tree of ACE2 could roughly match the infectivity pattern of SARS-CoV. The findings indicate that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 may have different evolutionary perspective on cross-species transmission than SARS-CoV. In future study, we will try to identify the cell receptor used by Scotophilus bat CoV-512 and use real-time PCR with species-specific primers to quantify the mRNA levels of the identified cell receptor because the detection of cell receptors by using IFA would encounter the limitations of antibodies unable to bind to the cell receptors of different animal species. APN was identified as the cell receptor of HCoV-229E, TGEV, FCoV, and possibly PEDV. In human, APN is mostly expressed in epithelial cells of the kidney, intestine, and respiratory tract; granulocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cerebral pericytes at the blood-brain barrier, synaptic membranes of cells in the central nerve system (CNS). The highest expression levels of APN can be found in the small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells [24] . The tissue specificity and distribution of APN were correlated with the high entry efficiencies of FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP pseudovirus APN was identified as the cell receptor of HCoV-229E, TGEV, FCoV, and possibly PEDV. In human, APN is mostly expressed in epithelial cells of the kidney, intestine, and respiratory tract; granulocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cerebral pericytes at the blood-brain barrier, synaptic membranes of cells in the central nerve system (CNS). The highest expression levels of APN can be found in the small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells [24] . The tissue specificity and distribution of APN were correlated with the high entry efficiencies of FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP pseudovirus in dog kidney cells (MDCK), black flying fox brain cells (Pabr), rat small intestine cells (IEC-6), pig kidney cells (PK15), and black flying fox kidney cells (Paki). However, different animal species may have different tissue specificity and distribution of APN even though little information is available. According to the studies on DPP4 distribution, insectivorous bats primarily express DPP4 in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and kidneys, frugivorous bats express DPP4 in the respiratory and GI tracts [25] , camels express DPP4 in the upper respiratory tract [26] , and humans express DPP4 mainly in the lower respiratory tract [27] . Different tissue distribution of DPP4 in different animal species leads to different tissue tropism of MERS-CoV and varied disease severity [24] [25] [26] [27] . ACE2 was identified as the cell receptor of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 although two CoVs bind to different parts of ACE2 [28] . The highest expression levels of ACE2 are found in small intestine, duodenum, gall bladder, kidney, testis, and heart [24] . All three cells showing the highest entry efficiencies of FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus were kidney epithelial cells: HEK-293T, PK15, and MDCK cells, and they all tested positive for ACE2.",

            "text": "CoV spike proteins require proteolytic activation to mediate virus entry into cells but different CoVs use different types of proteases for their cell entry mechanism. PEDV uses lysosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsin L and cathepsin B) to activate S protein, whereas other CoVs use proprotein convertases or cell-surface serine proteases [29] . Extracellular trypsin could activate the entry of PEDV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV into host cells [29] . Scotophilus bat CoV-512 is more closely related to PEDV than to other known alpha-CoVs, such as TGEV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 [14, 16, 30] . Although Scotophilus bat CoV-512 may have an entry mechanism similar to that of PEDV, differences are expected because amino acid sequence identity between the S proteins from Scotophilus bat CoV-512 and PEDV is only 48% for the S1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain [17] . For example, although MDCK was not susceptible to PEDV [17] , it showed the highest luciferase activity for the entry of Scotophilus bat CoV-512. Both Scotophilus bat CoV-512 and PEDV can enter PK15 [17] due to the potential gene recombination between the two CoVs during co-infection. Further studies are warranted to verify the types of requisite proteases for proteolytic activation of the S protein for cell entry by Scotophilus bat CoV-512. SARS-CoV pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in HEK-293, PK15, and MDCK cells, followed by Caco-2, Pabr, Paki, Vero, Palu, IEC-6, MFK, and Fcwf-4 cells. Studies have shown Vero, Caco-2, PK15, and HEK-293T cells as susceptible to infection by live SARS-CoV Urbani and HKU 39849 strains, but not MDCK cells even though these cells can express ACE2 [31, 32] . HEK-293T, Vero, and Caco-2 cells were also susceptible to the entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus; however, no data about the susceptibility of MDCK cells to SARS-CoV pseudovirus are available [33] . Strong luciferase activity detected in the MDCK cells inoculated with FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus indicated viral entry mediated by the binding between SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 on the surface of MDCK cells without interference from other cellular factors, such as glycosylation on S protein [34] or ACE2 [35] , which can cause MDCK cells to resist the infection by live SARS-CoV [31] . Moreover, different glycosylation profiles can determine the host range of CoVs. For example, human APN can lose or gain its ability to support HCoV-229E infection when a glycosylation site is added to human APN or removed from the mouse APN, respectively [36, 37] . Additionally, the addition of a glycosylation site to the rat ACE2 allows it to support SARS-CoV infection [38] . Further studies on glycosylation profiles can be insightful on the range of hosts of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 once its cell receptor is identified.",

We used the pseudoviruses carrying S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV to study the cell entry of CoV. There are still many questions to be answered after we identified the cells susceptible to Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV, including the identification of cell receptor for Scotophilus bat CoV-512, the glycosylation patterns of S protein and cell receptor, and the usage of viral and host proteases. In addition to cell entry, successful cross-species transmission requires viral replication and strategies to evade the innate immune responses of the new hosts. Marburg virus study showed that the increase in virus replication in bats may correlate with an increased incidence of human spillover events [39] . The correlations between virus replication rates and cross-species transmission of CoVs have not been explored for bats. Replicase and E protein are essential for CoV replication [40, 41] . Accessory proteins of CoVs are not required for virus replication in cultured cells [42] but may play an important role in pathogenesis in natural hosts [43] . Viral proteins, in particular nsp1 [44] , nsp3 [45] , N protein and the SARS-CoV accessary protein ORF6, ORF3b [46] , and ORF4a [47] , prevent IFN induction. Scotophilus bat CoV-512 would need to evolve a strategy to overcome the innate immune responses in new host cells.",

            "text": "The susceptibility of bat cells to MERS-CoV has been increasingly studied since the first laboratory-confirmed case in 2012 because of its close phylogenetic relationships with Tylonycteris bat CoV-HKU4, Pipistrellus bat CoV-HKU5 [6] , and Hypsugo pulveratus bat CoV-HKU25 [48] . Twelve primary bat-cell lines from seven bat species were tested for their susceptibility to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E [49] . While HCoV-229E cannot infect any bat cells and SARS-CoV can only infect kidney cells of Rhinolophus sinicus, MERS-CoV can infect five different bat cells from four different bat species; additionally, Muller's study demonstrated that MERS-CoV could infect five different bat cells from five different bat species [49, 50] . These findings indicate that MERS-CoV has a much broader cell tropism than SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. Although, in this study, MERS-CoV pseudovirus was not tested, IFA was used to determine the distribution of DPP4 on the 11 tested cells. A previous study showed that DPP4 surface expression varied between species but did not correlate with infectivity [51] although significantly higher mRNA expression levels of DPP4 were detected in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV than those in non-susceptible cells [49] . In the future, comparison of susceptibility of these cells to Scotophilus bat CoV-512 and MERS-CoV should be noteworthy.",

Strong positive IFA responses meant there were more than 200 positive cells per microscopic field and weak positive IFA responses meant less than 200 positive cells per microscopic field. HEK-293T, MDCK, and Fcwf-4 cells had strong positive IFA responses and PK15 had a weak positive IFA response to APN. HEK-293T, MDCK, and Vero cells had strong positive IFA responses and PK15, Caco-2, Fcwf-4, and MFK cells had weak positive IFA responses to ACE2. HEK-293T and Paki cells had strong positive IFA responses and PK15, Vero, and Caco-2 cells had weak positive IFA responses to DPP4. In summary, HEK-293T and PK15 cells were tested positive for APN, ACE2, and DPP4. Vero and Caco-2 cells were tested positive for ACE2 and DPP4. Fcwf-4 and MDCK cells were tested positive for APN and ACE2. MFK cells were tested positive only for ACE2. Paki cells were tested positive only for DPP4. Pabr, ICE-6, and Palu cells were tested negative for APN, ACE2, and DPP4.
