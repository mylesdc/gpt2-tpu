            "text": "To complement traditional antivirals, natural compounds that act via host targets and present high barriers to resistance are of increasing interest. In the work reported here, we detected that homoharringtonine (HHT) presents effective antiviral activity. HHT completely inhibited infections of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 nM in cell cultures, respectively. Treatment with HHT at doses of 0.05 or 0.2 mg/kg significantly reduced viral load and relieved severe symptoms in PEDV-or NDV-infected animals. HHT treatment, however, moderately inhibited avian influenza virus (AIV) infection, suggesting its potent antiviral action is restricted to a number of classes of RNA viruses. In this study, we also observed that HHT actively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 139 nM; the treatment with HHT at 1000 nM led to reductions of three orders of magnitude. Moreover, HHT antagonized the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E), which might regulate the selective translation of specific messenger RNA (mRNA). HHT provides a starting point for further progress toward the clinical development of broad-spectrum antivirals.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the understanding of the mechanism and regulation of translation made major progress. The translation process consists of three steps-initiation, elongation, and termination. The initiation phase can be carried out in two ways in eukaryotic cells-cap-dependent or cap-independent [1] . Some viruses accomplish translation initiation via cap-dependent mechanisms with varying utilization of host eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) [2] . In the cap-dependent mechanism, to translate a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, it is important that the mRNA be recruited in the eIF4F complex, which is composed of three proteins-the eIF4E protein, which binds to the cap, helicase eIF4A, and eIF4G [3, 4] . The eIF4E protein can control eIF4F complex formation and interfere with cellular translation via phosphorylation on serine 209 [1, 5] . The regulation of the elongation cycle is best studied in the eukaryotic system. All known viruses rely on cellular elongation factors for expression of the viral genome.",

            "text": "Viruses lack their own translational apparatus and are dependent entirely on the cellular translation machinery for their genome replication, new particle assembly, and release of new viral progeny. Especially for RNA viruses, translation of the viral genome is a critical control point in the replication cycle; several drugs were developed to take advantage of this vulnerability. As it is known, ribavirin of a guanosine analog inhibits replication of RNA and DNA viruses via distinctive mechanisms [6] . It represses the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) via distinct mechanisms in different cell types, depending on intracellular ribavirin metabolism [7] . Among other mechanism of actions, ribavirin blocks eIF4E activity, and thus, reduces eIF4E-dependent survival signaling [8, 9] . Silvestrol has multiple mechanisms of action, including an effect on certain microRNA, proteins important to protect the cell from damage, and proteins involved in the cell cycle [10] . It also acts as a specific inhibitor of eIF4A [11] , which is a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus replication [12] . Viruses utilize host cell machinery of translation to facilitate their own replication. Inhibitors of translation elongation, an obligate step in the viral replication cycle, may also provide a general antiviral strategy. Properly used, cycloheximide (CHX) can block viral replication; unfortunately, its cytotoxic side effects and poor tolerability were prohibitive for its development as a drug [13, 14] . Lactimidomycin (LTM) prevents the ribosome from leaving the start site and blocks the very first round of translation elongation. This recently established anticancer agent [15] potently inhibits infections of dengue virus and other RNA viruses in cell culture [16] .",

HHT was used in China for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other types of tumor diseases for the past 30 years [19] . Omacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of HHT, was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CML treatment in 2012. Pro-survival protein Mcl-1 and pro-oncoprotein c-Myc are critical regulators that promote the survival of leukemia cells; HHT could affect the survival of leukemia cells by allowing the rapid loss of short-lived Mcl-1 and c-Myc to facilitate proapoptotic triggering [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Leukemia cells express a high level of phosphorylated eIF4E; inhibiting phosphorylation of eIF4E represents a unique approach for the treatment of cancer development and progression [24, 25] . It was recently reported that HHT targets the phosphorylated serine 209 residue of eIF4E, resulting in the degradation of phosphorylated eIF4E, thereby eradicating the growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo [26, 27] .",

In this paper, we evaluated the effect of a plant alkaloid HHT ( Figure 1A) , a natural product first discovered in Cephalotaxus harringtonii, on VSV replication. No measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M [37, 38] . Therefore, HHT at concentrations below 1 \u00b5M was administered in the experiments described here. For testing potential dose-dependent antiviral activity, HEK293T cells were infected with VSV in the presence of HHT or ribavirin at increasing concentrations. We observed that viral yields were reduced by 1.5 orders of magnitude when treated with HHT at 50 nM, and viral yields were dramatically reduced in cells treated with HHT at 100 nM; no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected.

            "text": "To analyze the specificity of HHT for viral replication, we investigated its impact on the level of viral protein by Western blotting. We observed a strong reduction in viral protein G levels of VSV (VSV-G) at 24 and 36 h post infection (h.p.i.) under treatment with HHT at 50 nM ( Figure 1C ). Time-of-addition studies were conducted to identify the window in the VSV replication cycle when HHT exerted its antiviral effect. The results showed that pre-treatment of cells with HHT for 2 h prior to VSV infection produced a minimal inhibitory effect against viral infection. This suggests that HHT does not inhibit the VSV entry process ( Figure 1D) . A complete reduction of the viral yields was observed when HHT was added at the time of infection and from 2 h.p.i. onward. Addition of HHT at 6 and 8 h.p.i. led to strong viral reductions of 6.5 and 5 orders of magnitude. Under the same experimental conditions, strong reductions in VSV-G levels were observed with co-treatment and post-treatment for up to 8 h for VSV infection ( Figure 1E ). These results indicate that HHT acts in the viral replication cycle after viral entry. HEK293T cells were exposed to VSV at 0.5 MOI, and treated with HHT at 50 nM at different time points before, simultaneously with, or after infection. At 48 h.p.i., viral yields in the medium were determined by TCID 50 . These experiments were performed two times with three replicates in each experiment. Values represent means and SD. Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 compared to PBS-treated group (D). Under the same experimental conditions, electrophoretically separated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to VSV-G and actin (E).",

In the present research effort, cells were infected with GFP-NDV in the presence of increasing doses of HHT. We observed that HHT at 50 nM greatly reduced the production of a recombinant NDV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), as determined by light microscopy (Figure 2A) . HeLa cells displayed no difference in morphology and number compared to the mock infected sample when treated with HHT at 100 nM. Correspondingly, HHT treatment showed a dose-dependent reduction in infection rate. As shown in Figure 2B , we estimated a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 18 nM, and an IC 90 of 40 nM was observed. No measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at concentrations below 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 2B) . We also observed a strong reduction in NDV-NP level in cells treated with HHT at 50 nM ( Figure 2C ). HeLa cells seeded at 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well in 24-well plates were exposed to GFP-NDV at 0.1 MOI in the presence of HHT at increasing concentrations for 24 h. Expression of GFP was directly observed using a DP73 camera by fluorescence microscopy on an Olympus IX73 microscope 25 (magnification 10\u00d7) (a-f), and were assessed under light microscopy (a -f ). One image is representative of three (A). Under the same experimental conditions, the infection rate of HHT on GFP-NDV infection was expressed as percent reduction in fluorescence activity of the infected cells without HHT treatment, which was set at 0%. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated as indicated by the fine dotted lines. These experiments were performed two times with three replicates in each experiment. Values represent means and SD. Bottom, effects of HHT on HeLa cell viability were determined, and assessed as indicated in Figure 1B .

Remarkably, 0.2 mg/kg HHT provided the optimal inhibitory activity, and completely inhibited viral infection. Finally, we studied whether HHT displays potent antiviral activity against NDV in chickens. As shown in Figure 2E ,F, 0.2 mg/kg HHT significantly decreased the mRNA level of NDV-NP in the liver and lung ( Figure 2E ), and blood ( Figure 2F ).

Using immunohistochemistry analysis and H&E staining, we detected the distribution of AIV (Figure 4Ac ,g) and an inflammation and erythrocyte infiltration (d,h) in the lungs of infected mice. No obvious reduction in the number of AIV positive cells was observed in mice treated with HHT at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (e,i). Moreover, HHT treatment for two days decreased local inflammatory reaction but aggravated overall inflammation (f), while HHT treatment for four days resulted in moderately attenuated inflammation (j). No obvious inflammatory reaction was seen in mice treated with HHT at days 0, 2, and 4 after administration (k,l,m). These results indicated that HHT did not efficiently affect AIV-induced inflammation and damage. We also studied the effect of HHT on AIV in embryos. As shown in Figure 4B , 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 1.1 and 1.3 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i.; and 0.2 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 2.6 and 2.0 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i., respectively. Taken together, we conclude that, for a given dose, HHT did not produce inhibitory effects on AIV, as compared to its action on other RNA viruses considered in this paper. Six-to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were mock infected (a,b) or intranasally (i.n.) injected with 10 6 PFU of AIV, while being intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.8 mg/kg/day HHT (e,f,i,j) or PBS containing 1% DMSO (c,d,g,h) in 100 \u00b5L volume for two sequential days. Representative lung sections from each group were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with antibody against AIV-NP (left) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (right) at two or four days post infection. HHT at days 0, 2, and 4 after treatment (k,l,m). Arrows in right panel indicate inflammatory cell infiltration, erythrocyte infiltration, and drop in mucous epithelium in bronchia (A).

The results showed that the level of endogenous p-eIF4E was increased upon PEDV, HSV-1, and PRV ( Figure 6B-D, lanes 1-2) infection. Furthermore, high levels of p-eIF4E, in parallel with the level of viral protein, were gradually reduced under treatment with increasing doses of HHT (lanes 3-7) . These results demonstrate that the antiviral effect of HHT might be associated with its function as a p-eIF4E inhibitor. To further clarify whether HHT regulating p-eIF4E level is associated with viral replication, two constructs encoding the wild-type FLAG-tagged eIF4E and the phosphorylation-incompetent variant eIF4E-S209A were transiently transfected, followed by HSV-1 infection. As shown in Figure 6E , the ectopic expression of wild-type eIF4E (lane 3), but not eIF4E-S209A (lane 4), greatly improved the level of p-eIF4E, and also upregulated the expression of viral ICP8 (lane 3). Furthermore, we detected that HHT treatment decreased the accumulation of p-eIF4E induced by the ectopic expression of wild-type eIF4E, coincident with decreased viral propagation (lane 5). Taken together, the results shown in Figure 6B -E indicate that HHT attenuates the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eIF4E to counteract HSV-1 replication. ",

We detected that HHT treatment at 1000 nM produces an inhibition of viral yield of 3.0 and 4.6 orders of magnitude for DNA viruses HSV-1 and PRV, at 72 and 48 h.p.i., respectively. It is interesting to note that cells that were infected with HSV-1 or PRV for 10 h in the presence of HHT at 100 nM showed strong reduction in viral replication. These results indicate that HHT's effect is time-dependent, and HHT should be utilized against DNA viruses in the earliest feasible stage of replication. Considering its selective antiviral activity, we hypothesize that HHT may sensitize cells to prevent viral replication through additional, complementary mechanisms.",

Total eIF4E activity is required for proliferation of both tumor and normal cells, whereas phosphorylated eIF4E is not essential for normal cell proliferation and survival, but is specifically required for cancer cells [54] [55] [56] . Stimulation of eIF4E phosphorylation is correlated with facilitated translation and replication of some viruses [57] [58] [59] , including murine coronavirus [60] and herpesvirus HSV-1 [61] . In contrast, dephosphorylation of eIF4E occurs during infection with influenza virus [62] , VSV, or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [63] . Sometimes, phosphorylation is not required for eIF4E to support the viral replication of hepatitis E virus [64] . Notably, fibroblasts and mice in which the serine at position 209 of eIF4E is replaced with alanine (low level of p-eIF4E) are less susceptible to virus infections, including HSV-1, VSV, and EMCV [65] . Therefore, the phosphorylation status of eIF4E acts as a determinant of host susceptibility to a virus.",

These results demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of HHT on viral infections is associated with the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Phosphorylated eIF4E would rather favor the translation of selective mRNAs than impair translation initiation on a more global level upon viral infection [58, 66] . Thus, it is promising to find possible therapeutic agents that are involved in selective translation, with viral replication specifically blocked but host cell translation unaffected.

Compared to traditional drug discovery and development, a repositioned drug offers significant advantages, including minimal risk of failure, since the toxicity, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug are already known. Therefore, the cost and time needed to bring a drug to market are significantly reduced. Furthermore, short duration therapy-several days are sufficient to treat most acute viral infections, while chronic diseases might require months or years-would presumably reduce drug loading, and therefore, drug-related toxicity and possible side effects. The broad inhibitory effect of HHT on viral replication warrants further evaluation of this natural compound as a first-line therapeutic to combat viruses, including emerging and pathogenic species. Combination therapy to target both viral components and cellular mechanisms might improve antiviral efficacy, reduce viral resistance, and minimize toxicity and side effects in the control of viral infections and epidemic viral diseases.",

In addition, our preliminary results show that HHT antagonizes the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eIF4E in Vero and HeLa cells. The potent antiviral action of HHT is restricted to a number of classes of viruses; more details and clarification are still needed. ",

(E) HeLa cells in a T-25 flask were transfected with FLAG-tagged eIF4E (lanes 3,5) or eIF4E-S209A plasmid (lanes 4,6) (5 \u00b5g each), in the absence (lanes 1-4) or presence (lanes 5,6) of HHT at 100 nM, then mock infected (lane 1) or infected with HSV-1/F at 10 MOI for 10 h (lanes 2-6). Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. One of two independent experiments is shown.",
