Here, the authors perform a detailed, mechanistic analysis of what leads to this phenotype and show nicely that in mice infected with a \"pathogenic\" strain AF15561 there are increases in monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN early in infection and depletion of these cells leads to an accumulation of lymphocytes and restoration of the dLN organization after CHIKV infection. They go on to show that depletion of Gr-1 positive cells also increases CHIKV specific B-cell responses. To continue their mechanistic studies, they perform a beautiful set of genetic experiments to show that the monocyte recruitment is dependent on MyD88, Nos2 and Nox2 are involved in the disruption of the dLN during CHIKV infection, and iNos expression is controlled by an IFNAR and IRF5 dependent pathway. Finally, they show that there are distinct pathways activation ISGs in the footpad (IRF3/IRF7 dependent) and the dLN (IRF5 dependent). Overall, this study was well-written, easy to follow, and is novel, contributing to multiple areas of CHIKV infection. However, I had a few concerns that will should be addressed.",

The authors make the point several times that the clearance of attenuated, acute CHIKV infections are due to B-cell and Ab responses (Lines 80-81 for example) and that during persistent, pathogenic CHIKV infections \"virus-specific B-cell responses may be impaired\" (Lines 82-83). I took this as an important point of the paper and that the authors were hypothesizing that the impaired B cell response is what is responsible or partly responsible for persistence of pathogenic CHIKV. The authors do address B-cell specific responses in Figure 4 and nicely show increases in CHIKV specific B-cells. However, it is unclear if this increase in B cells leads to increased clearance of pathogenic CHIKV and is a potential mechanism for persistence. The authors should measure viral titers in Gr-1 depleted mice to determine if pathogenic CHIKV has increased clearance after monocyte depletion and B cell recruitment. If this was not the point of the paper the authors may want to focus the writing on the disorganized dLN, etc phenotype and leave out viral clearance and persistence until the discussion. If this was addressed but didn't work, the authors should include some lines in the discussion about potential mechanisms.",

In previous studies, we found that the attenuated CHIKV 181/25 strain, in contrast to its parental pathogenic CHIKV strain AF15561, is cleared from WT mice but not from mice lacking the capacity to produce virus-specific antibody, suggesting that B cell responses are essential for clearance of 181/25 infection and that the pathogenic AF15561 strain evades these clearance mechanisms [1] . Moreover, the differential clearance of the two strains in WT mice was associated with differences in the quality of the CHIKV-specific antibody response [1] . For these reasons, we performed studies to evaluate the development of the immune response in the draining lymph node (dLN), the first lymphoid organ to encounter antigen following infection, after infection with either attenuated or pathogenic CHIKV strains.",

In this study, we identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause disruption of dLN architecture and lymphocyte accumulation during pathogenic CHIKV infection. In addition, we evaluated their impact on important aspects of the B cell response including the development of GCs, antibody-secreting cells, and plasma cells in the dLN. Overall, the experiments revealed that a MyD88dependent influx of monocytes and neutrophils disrupts lymph node organization and impairs lymph node B cell responses via IRF5-dependent, IRF3/7-independent, activation of lymph node monocytes, iNOS, and NOX2. We stated in the Introduction section that \"the mechanisms leading to dLN architectural disruption and impaired lymphocyte accumulation remain to be defined\" (lines 87-88), indicating that this was the main goal of our investigations. We have been careful with the conclusions made from the data outlined in this manuscript, noting only that the influx of myeloid cells to the dLN reduces the accumulation of lymphocytes, disrupts lymphocyte organization, and impairs the development of virus-specific B cell responses in the dLN (lines 89-91, 291-294,  and 391-393) . To temper our conclusions, we have changed the final sentence of the manuscript to reflect that our findings \"underscore how local innate immune responses in draining lymphoid tissue dictate the magnitude of downstream adaptive immunity\" (lines 397-398).",

First, monocytes infiltrate joint-associated tissue during infection with CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses and have antiviral effects at this site through the production of type I IFN [4] . Additionally, monocytes are the effector cell required for monoclonal Abmediated clearance of CHIKV [5] . To address this question with a more targeted approach, we are in the process of generating Nox2 fl/fl and Nos2 fl/fl mice to specifically delete expression of these genes in monocytes and/or neutrophils, which should show reduced disruption of dLN B cell responses and allow us to assess the impact on viral loads without altering other important functions of these cells in the antiviral response.

In Figure S3 , we showed that myeloid cell depletion had modest effects on the GC B cell and plasma cell response in the inguinal LN and spleen. However, the most pronounced effects occurred in the dLN (Figure 4) , suggesting that the modestly improved neutralizing activity of the serum observed following myeloid cell depletion is primarily due to the increased GC B cell and plasma cell response within the dLN itself. The data in Figure 4M were simply intended to show that differences in the dLN Ab response are measurable as a modest systemic improvement (lines 181-182) , while the main focus of the paper was on responses in the dLN. [4] . Additionally, monocytes are the effector cell required for monoclonal Ab-mediated clearance of CHIKV [5] . To address this question with a more targeted approach, we are in the process of generating Nox2 fl/fl and Nos2 fl/fl mice to specifically delete expression of these genes in monocytes and/or neutrophils, which should minimize disruption of dLN B cell responses and allow us to assess the impact on viral loads without altering other important functions of these cells in the antiviral response. These studies are beyond the scope of this report. In the interim, as outlined above, we infected congenic lymphotoxin alpha-deficient (LT\u03b1 -/-) mice, which lack peripheral LNs [3] , with the attenuated CHIKV 181/25 strain (see new Fig S1) . While 181/25 is cleared or nearly at the limit of detection in WT mice by 28 dpi, it persists in the right ankle of LT\u03b1 -/mice at levels similar to that of WT mice infected with the pathogenic AF15561 strain. These data suggest that LN responses are essential for the clearance of CHIKV 181/25 infection.",

It would be informative to immunophenotype all the cells in the dLN. Since depletion of both neutrophil and monocytes does not completely rescue CD8+ T cells from the dLN (Fig.  2K ) and IRF5 is required and constitutively expressed in DCs, it is possible that DCs might play a role in viral persistence.

Because the percentage of monocytes is not affected in IFNAR1deficient mice, the reduction in monocyte number is due to the reduction in total dLN cells from the lack of this general shutdown mechanism rather than a specific effect of type I IFNs on monocyte accumulation. [17] . In addition, a subsequent study identified a large number of common genes activated by these two IRFs in response to viral infection [19] . However, there also were several distinct, non-overlapping genes induced by IRF5 versus IRF7, or genes that were induced more effectively by IRF5 than IRF7 (one of which was Rsad2). Thus, the difference in IRF3/7 versus IRF5 dependency may be somewhat gene-specific, in that induction of Ifit1 and Rsad2 are only partially IRF5-dependent in the dLN.

More detailed time-courses, isotype differences and/or study of anti-CHIKV memory B-cells or long-lived plasma cells from outside the LN may also identify more significant differences. There is also no discussion of impact on disease outcomes in the mice. Obviously there are issues with downstream effects on viral clearance by these cells in tissues, however with careful timing, or in some of the mouse strains, it seems like some mitigation of disease should be observed if the germinal center disruption really plays a significant role in pathogenesis.
