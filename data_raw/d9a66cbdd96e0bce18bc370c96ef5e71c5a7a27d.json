Firstly, the XION hydrophilic stationary phase was chosen to separate the antibacterial crude diterpenes-rich sample (18.0 g) into three fractions with a recovery of 46.1%. Then, the antibacterial fractions I (200 mg), II (200 mg), and III (150 g) were separated by the Megress C18 preparative column, and compounds tanshinone IIA (80.0 mg), salvinolone (62.0 mg), cryptotanshinone (70.0 mg), and ferruginol (68.0 mg) were produced with purities greater than 98%. The procedure achieved large-scale preparation of the four diterpenes with high purity, and it could act as a reference for the efficient preparation of active diterpenes from other plant extracts.",

Previous chemical investigations have proved that Salvia species possess two main classes of biologically active substances: phenylpropanoids and diterpenes [1] [2] [3] . Diterpenes, the principal active constituents of other Salvia plants, have numerous pharmacological functions, including antibacterial [4] , anti-inflammatory [5] , and anticancer activities [6, 7] . In our preliminary experiment, the crude diterpenes-rich sample of S. prattii displayed considerable antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 125 \u00b5g/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 125 \u00b5g/mL), and Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC: 250 \u00b5g/mL). To identify the main antibacterial constituents of the sample, it is desirable to obtain the diterpenes in adequate purity and quantity. Thus, the objective of this work is to develop an efficient process for the purification of diterpenes from the diterpenes-rich sample of S. prattii.",

However, such methods have numerous drawbacks, such as low yields, being time-consuming, producing a large quantity of solvent waste, and non-suitability for large-scale industrial production. In recent times, high-speed counter-current chromatography, a liquid-liquid chromatographic method, was proposed for the isolation of diterpenes from Salvia plants [10] [11] [12] . Even though this technique offers high-separation efficiency, it requires several hours, rather than minutes needed for preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC).",

It is preferred over other chromatography methods, owing to higher efficiency, greater resolution, and better reproducibility through online monitoring and automatic control [16] [17] [18] . Consequently, prep-HPLC has been drawing ever-increasing attention from phytochemists and the pharma industry. However, a crude extract cannot be directly subjected to prep-HPLC separation; other separation techniques are usually required for enrichment of the main compounds of the crude extract. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography solid-phase extraction (HILIC-SPE), which employs stationary phases with polar functional groups bonded to silica gel surface, has been extensively used to enrich compounds of interest from natural products due to its applicability, ease of use and regeneration, as well as complementary selectivity to reversed-phase liquid chromatography [19] . A few studies reported the separation of diterpenes from S. miltiorrhiza using high-speed counter-current chromatography [20] [21] [22] , but no reports mentioned the separation of diterpenes by a combination of HILIC-SPE and prep-HPLC. Hence, this study aimed to develop a valuable protocol for the purification of four antibacterial diterpenes from a diterpenes-rich S. prattii crude sample. The developed protocol succeeded in achieving large-scale preparation of four highly pure diterpenes from the crude sample of S. prattii, paving way for the potential development of antibacterial drugs.",

To select an appropriate pretreatment, two chromatographic stationary phases i.e., the bare silica gel and the XION stationary phases, in three separation modes were tested for the separation of the crude extract; the representative separation chromatograms are shown in Figure 1 . As observed in Figure 1A ,B, the main diterpenes had inferior resolution on the bare silica gel stationary phase compared to that on the XION stationary phase under the same elution conditions (n-hexane/ethanol solvent system). The main diterpenes showed weak retention on the XION stationary phase with the mobile phases of 0.2% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile and in water ( Figure 1C ). According to the manufacturer, XION is a cysteine-bond silica gel stationary phase, and cysteine is a polar group, which gives the XION stationary phase the retention behavior of normal-phase chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography [23, 24] . Thus, the XION stationary phase should be employed for sample pretreatment under the normal-phase mode due to the favorable separation profile ( Figure 1B ).",

Similarly, V A and V P are the injection volumes of the analytical and preparative columns, respectively. The injection volumes (loading amount) of the analytical column and the preparative columns were 10 \u00b5L (V A ) and1181.5 \u00b5L (1.181 mL), respectively. However, this volume is too low to meet the requirements for the highly proficient preparation, and the preparative injection volume was larger but smaller than that of the sample loop (5.0 mL for fractions I, II, and III in actual operation). Under the optimized conditions, the separation chromatograms of fractions I-III on the analytical level and preparative level were shown in Figure 3 . The optimized analytical ( Figure 3A -C) and preparative ( Figure 3D -F) chromatographic profiles were similar, except for a slight increase in the retention times of peaks 1-4 on the prep-chromatograms. For peaks 2 and 3 ( Figure 3B ,E), the resolution on the analytical and preparative chromatograms were R SA = 2(R t2 \u2212 R t1 )/(W t2 + W t1 ) = 2.55 and R SP = 1.2, respectively, due to sample-overloading and the preparative column diffusion effect. The target compound chromatographic peaks were collected based on the UV absorption intensities considerably enhance the purity. Overall, 200.0 mg each of fractions I and II as well as 150.0 mg of fraction III were separated to obtain 80.0 mg of the peak 1 fraction, 62.0 mg of the peak 2 fraction, 70.0 mg of the peak 3 fraction, and 68.0 mg of the peak 4 fraction with recoveries of 40.0%, 66.0%, and 45.3%, respectively. The purities of the four isolated diterpenes were determined by HPLC on XAqua C3 analytical column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m). The results are given in Figure 4 : Figure 4A -D show that the compounds possess purity greater than 98% (98.6% for compound 1, 99.9% for compound 2, 99.1% for compound 3, and 99.7% for compound 4). The UV spectra of the four diterpenes are included in the insets of Figure 4 ( Figure 4A 1 -D 1 ); they were in accordance with those in previous publications [23] [24] [25] [26] . In addition, the antibacterial activity of the four isolated diterpenes was also tested ( Table 1) : Compound 4 showed the strongest activity (MIC: 10-15 \u00b5g/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii; whereas compounds 1-3 also displayed potent activity against the same species (MIC: 20-50 \u00b5g/mL). The chemical structures of the isolated diterpenes have been determined by ESI-MS, 1 H-NMR, and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. By comparing the spectra of the compounds with literature data, we concluded that compounds 1-4 represent tanshinone IIA, salvinolone, cryptotanshinone, and ferruginol. The chemical structures of tanshinone IIA (compound 1), salvinolone (2), cryptotanshinone (3), and ferruginol (4) are shown in Figure 5 and the detailed data of the compounds are given below. 19 .4 (C-6). The ESI-MS, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR data for compound 4 agree with the literature data reported for ferruginol [28] .",

            "text": "An efficient preparative procedure involving non-aqueous HILIC-SPE followed by prep-HPLC was developed for the preparation of antibacterial tanshinone IIA, salvinolone, cryptotanshinone, and ferruginol from a crude diterpenes-rich sample of the roots of S. prattii. Initially, HILIC-SPE was used to separate 18.0 g of crude diterpenes-rich sample into three fractions (2.8 g of fraction I, 3.4 g of fraction II, and 2.1 g of fraction III). Then, a DAC-50 prep-HPLC column containing Megress C18 stationary phase was used to isolate the diterpenes from the three fractions. The separation of each fraction on the Megress C18 was performed by optimizing the separation conditions on the Megress C18 analytical column and transforming the conditions to a Megress C18 preparative column. The coeluted diterpenes from the HILIC-SPE stationary phase were separated at large-scale sample amounts on the Megress C18 reversed stationary phase, brought about by the diverse sample separation mechanisms of both the stationary phases. Owing to the different selectivities and the optimized collection mode, 80.0 mg of tanshinone IIA, 62.0 mg of salvinolone, 70.0 mg of cryptotanshinone, and 68.0 mg of ferruginol at greater than 98% purity were prepared from 200.0 mg each of fractions I and II as well as 150.0 mg of fraction III with a single preparation. The purified diterpenes were identified as tanshinone IIA, salvinolone, cryptotanshinone, and ferruginol by UV, Mass, and NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, the present work offers an excellent protocol for the preparation of active diterpenes from plant sources.",
