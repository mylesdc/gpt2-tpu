Rapid detection could facilitate control, however widespread point-of-care testing is infrequently done due to the lack of robust and portable methods. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a novel isothermal method which rapidly amplifies and detects nucleic acids using a simple device in near real-time. An RT-RPA assay targeting a recent epidemic human norovirus strain (GII.4 New Orleans) was developed and evaluated in this study. The assay successfully detected purified norovirus RNA from multiple patient outbreak isolates and had a limit of detection of 3.40 \u00b1 0.20 log 10 genomic copies (LGC), which is comparable to most other reported isothermal norovirus amplification methods. The assay also detected norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay. The assay was specific, as it did not amplify genomes from 9 non-related enteric viruses and bacteria. The assay detected norovirus in some samples in as little as 6 min, and the entire detection process can be performed in less than 30 min. The reported RT-RPA method shows promise for sensitive point-of-care detection of epidemic human norovirus, and is the fastest human norovirus amplification method to date.",

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a novel isothermal PCR alternative that produces results in 20 minutes or less with portable instrumentation. RPA uses bacterial recombinase enzymes to anneal primers to template DNA for extension and amplification by an isothermal polymerase 6,7 . The basic RPA platform has been used in concert with a reverse transcriptase and a fluorescent probe system for real time detection of viral pathogens with RNA genomes 8, 9 . Its use of sequence repair enzymes theoretically provides a higher fidelity than RT-qPCR 6,7 , although the assay's sensitivity to matrix-associated inhibitors is poorly characterized.

Consistent positive signal was only observed for both GII.4 human norovirus strains. Human norovirus GII.3 produced positive signal for one replicate at one dilution, but was otherwise negative. The GII.4 Sydney strain, the most recent circulating epidemic strain 10 , repeatedly produced positive signal in 8.1-15.3 min over a 3.0 LGC range of input RNA. The repeatable amplification and positive signal of GII.4 Sydney suggests that some degree of base mismatching is tolerated in the RT-RPA system, despite its reliance on recombinase enzymes (Table 4 ). There were a total of 6 mismatches in the assay's targeted region when comparing GII.4 New Orleans and Sydney strains, whereas there were 16 mismatches when comparing GII.3 with GII.4 New Orleans. Sydney does not differ from New Orleans in the probe region and has only 4 and 3 base mismatches in the forward and reverse primer target regions, respectively. GII.3 has 3 probe, 2 forward, and 11 reverse primer target region mismatches. It is likely that the reverse primer target region is the reason for the lack of consistent reactivity for GII.3.",

When human fecal samples positive for norovirus GII.4 New Orleans were extracted for RNA isolation followed by RT-RPA, virus could be detected in all patient specimens, with longer amplification times to target signal corresponding to lower input template concentrations.

The first human norovirus LAMP assay targeted a similar genome region to the RT-RPA, was designed to detect both GI and GII viruses, and had a detection limit of 2-3 LGC/25 \u03bc l reaction. Sensitivity and specificity approached 100% and results were achieved in 60-90 min 11 . Yoda et al. 17 designed their own LAMP assay targeting the ORF1-ORF2 junction and were able to improve on the detection limit (to 1-2 LGC/25 \u03bc l reaction) and increase inclusivity by design changes. In another study, Iturriza-Gomara et al. 18 evaluated a commercial RT-LAMP for norovirus detection relative to an RT-PCR, finding a slightly lower sensitivity for the GI RT-LAMP but a higher sensitivity for the RT-LAMP assay. Newer LAMP designs are facilitating colorimetric endpoints and can be used even for genotyping 19, 20 .",

However, in our work some degree of base mismatch appears to have been tolerated as we were able to detect two different GII.4 strains, although older strains have not been evaluated. However, having a method that reliably detects GII.4 norovirus is relevant as this genotype is responsible for at least 70% of norovirus cases in the United States 23 and 80-95% of outbreaks globally 24 .

            "text": "With the exception of the early work of Greene et al. 12 , this is the first study of isothermal amplification in which fecal suspensions without prior RNA extraction were used as template. Our results are generally consistent with Greene et al. 12 in that the RT-RPA assay produced more positives in samples with higher concentrations of fecal material as compared to RT-qPCR. Specifically, for our study's comparisons of sample positivity for 20% stool suspensions, about 60% were positive by RT-RPA while less than 20% of those same samples were positive by RT-qPCR ( Figure S1 ). This suggests that the RT-RPA method may have more tolerance for inhibitory compounds. When RPA was used for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from urine samples, no notable amplification inhibition occurred, although it was common when using PCR 25 . The authors hypothesized that RPA would be less susceptible to amplification inhibition because the assay relies on enzyme components and conditions more comparable to biological systems. For example, the use of a recombinase enzyme may provide increased primer binding efficiency. A polymerase derived from a bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis) that can grow at 37 \u00b0C may be more physiologically familiar, as would be an amplification reaction occurring under isothermal conditions of 40 \u00b0C 7 . Interestingly, the isothermal LAMP assay has also been shown to have a higher tolerance for inhibitors in other biological samples [26] [27] [28] . For instance, Enotomoto et al. 28 successfully directly detected herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in swab samples from patients with gingiovostomatitis or vesicular skin eruptions. In the same year, Kaneko et al. 27 found similar evidence for HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a LAMP assay considerably outperforming PCR when samples were directly amplified without DNA purification in patients with genitalitis, keratitis, and uveitis. Perhaps the most comprehensive evaluation of the sample matrix on isothermal amplification, Kaneko et al. 26 evaluated the HSV-1 LAMP assay relative to PCR in saline solution, PBS, Modified Eagle's Medium, serum, plasma, urine, aqueous, and vitreous solutions of different concentrations spiked with a low level of HSV-1 DNA. Although inhibition was inevitably noted at high concentrations for both assays, LAMP outperformed PCR 26 . However, further comparisons of isothermal methods to PCR are necessary before broad conclusions about the impact of inhibitors on amplification efficiency can be made.",

These earlier studies used an RNA standard to determine analytical sensitivity and showed RT-RPA detection limits < 1 LGC for bovine coronavirus 9 , and Rift Valley fever, Ebola, Marburg, Sudan and Sigma viruses 29, 30 . This is 2 LGC better than the limit of detection reported for our assay. However, our limit of detection was similar to that reported for a foot and mouth disease virus assay (3.16 LGC) 31 . There are a number of explanations for the differences in detection limits reported in the literature. Firstly, in the earlier studies, detection limits were based on an RNA standard generated from a plasmid, while our study used RNA directly purified from clinical samples. We believe that the latter approach, while producing higher detection limits, is more biologically relevant, because a full length genome may consume more RPA enzyme and also contain regions of increased secondary structure, both of which can impede enzymatic action 32 . Alternatively, the length of the amplicon reported here is longer than those reported by Euler et al. 29, 30 and Amer et al. 9 , but is similar in length to that reported by Abd El Wahed et al. 31 , who showed a similar higher limit of detection.",

            "text": "The RT-RPA assay was able to amplify the two most recent circulating epidemic GII.4 norovirus strains. This implies that despite its high fidelity, the assay is able to tolerate slight differences in target sequence. This is in agreement with Boyle et al. 33 , who reported that two different HIV-1 RPA primer-probe sets were capable of amplifying nearly all HIV-1 subtypes, including one isolate with 9 mismatches. In our report, GII.4 Sydney containing 6 total mismatches in the target region was readily amplified. The data of Daher et al. 34 , which focused on using RPA for amplification of conserved genes for several bacteria, showed a similar tolerance to base pair mismatches. Interestingly, the GII.3 template was inconsistently amplified by the NOF5-NOR11-NOP1 primer-probe set, the amplified region of which contained base mismatches on the 3\u2032 end of NOF5 and NOR11 target regions in addition to a large number of mismatches (Table 4 ). Such placement of mismatches was found by Daher et al. 34 to be more inhibitory to amplification than internal or 5\u2032 mismatches. The fact that the primer-probe set reported here did not amplify any other relevant enteric virus or bacterial nucleic acid suggests that it shows good specificity, reducing the likelihood of false positives. However, future studies building upon the foundational work presented here analyzing a larger number and diversity of human norovirus clinical samples must be completed to validate and evaluate the suitability of this assay for large scale clinical settings. For instance, analysis of the Table 4 . Sequence alignment of GII.4 strains and GII.3. The sequences of GII.4 New Orleans and Sydney strains as well as a GII.3 strain were aligned using the Mega 6 software package. Bolded sequences correspond to the NOF5 and NOR11 target sequence regions, with base mismatches for Sydney and GII.3 colored red. Probe target regions were excluded because there were 0 and 3 mismatches with New Orleans as compared to Sydney and GII.3, respectively. assay's reactivity with earlier strains of the GII.4 genotype and reactivity with the GII.17 genotype that is emerging as a genotype of significance 35 would be valuable future work. Another logical future direction to build on this work would be to design and optimize more degenerate primer-probe sets and potentially multiplex the assay for immediate genogrouping analysis. This is the first report on the use of the emerging RPA technology for the rapid detection of human norovirus. RT-RPA has multiple advantages over RT-qPCR, including: (i.) the lack of reliance on larger, more expensive equipment for amplification and detection; (ii.) the use of recombinase enzymes that reduce the likelihood of false positive results due to their inherent proofreading capabilities 6, 7, 36 ; (iii.) quicker time-to-result; and (iv) the potential for reduced impact of matrix-associated inhibitors. Theoretically, the RT-RPA assay is capable of direct, portable detection of epidemic human norovirus in clinical samples with minimal expertise in less than 30 minutes. With further optimization, in particular improvement of analytical sensitivity and comprehensive evaluation of assay specificity, RT-RPA has potential to be a promising alternative to RT-qPCR or other isothermal methods for rapid testing for human norovirus. Generation of a human norovirus RNA Standard by RT-qPCR. The amplifiable genomic copies of a sample was determined using an RNA standard curve as previously described 37 . Briefly, extracted GII.4 New Orleans RNA (Accession Number: JN595867) was first amplified with T7GII.4F and GII.4R primers (Table 1) using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 5 \u03bc l template. A 15 min reverse transcription cycle at 50 \u00b0C was then followed by enzyme inactivation at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 sec, 55 \u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec. The 460 nucleotide amplicon was gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to in vitro transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The transcribed RNA was purified and quantified (NanoPhotometer Pearl, Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ). It was then serially diluted and used to construct a standard curve with RT-qPCR using the JJV2F-COG2R-Ring2-TP primer probe set (Table 1 ) and the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with 45 cycles and a 54 \u00b0C annealing temperature. The RNA standard curve was used to estimate RNA copy number from extracted patient stool samples. Cq was evaluated with a threshold of 30 flourescence units using Bio-Rad CFX Manager software. All reactions were performed in triplicate.",

The reaction mixture was then added to rehydrate TwistAmp exo RT lyophilized enzyme pellets, and 2.5 \u03bc l of 280 mM magnesium acetate was added to the tops of reaction tube lids. The magnesium acetate droplets were then spun down using a minifuge and a timer immediately started. Reactions were quickly transferred to a Bio-Rad CFX Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) set to 40 \u00b0C with cycles read every 30 sec. Five min after the reactions were started, the cycler was paused, reactions mixed, spun down, and placed back on the thermal cycler to continue cycling. The total time to produce signal was calculated by the following equation (1) Evaluation of purified RNA and heated stool samples using RT-RPA and RT-qPCR. Twenty percent suspensions of norovirus GII.4 New Orleans-confirmed clinical samples from 12 patients were serially diluted and the RNA released by heating in a Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 99 \u00b0C for 5 min. Tubes were cooled on ice, mixed and briefly centrifuged. These heated stool dilutions were used directly as a template in RT-RPA reactions as described above, and in RT-qPCR reactions using the JJV2F-COG2R-Ring2-TP Scientific RepoRts | 7:40244 | DOI: 10.1038/srep40244 primer probe set (Table 1 ). In addition, NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG RNA extracts from each clinical sample were serially diluted and used in RT-RPA and RT-qPCR. The degree of correlation between RT-RPA time to detection (in min) and log 10 genomic copy input (by standard curve) was determined by linear regression using Microsoft Excel 2013 ( Figure S2 ). For evaluating the RT-RPA assay analytical sensitivity, serial dilutions of purified RNA from three selected stool samples (samples 29, 47 , and 58) were tested using as described above for a total of 8 replicates and a probit regression was performed for each using the JMP 12 software package (SAS, Cary, NC). The limit of detection and standard deviation was calculated by averaging the three values produced by the regressions. Each value reflected the predicted LGC for which 95% of tests would produce a positive result. All reaction sets included no template controls to confirm lack of contamination. Exclusivity testing and sequence analysis. The specificity was evaluated by analyzing multiple relevant enteric virus and bacterial strains for cross reactivity with the RT-RPA assay (Table 3) . Purified genomic nucleic acid was serially diluted, and 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22123 dilutions used directly as templates in RT-RPA. To analyze the degree of sequence difference between GII.4 New Orleans, for which the primers were designed, and two other human norovirus strains (GII.3 and GII.4 Sydney), sequences were aligned by performing Clustal W analysis using the MEGA 6 Software suite 39 .",

Twelve stool specimens from human norovirus outbreaks that occurred in 2012 in North Carolina were classified at genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) New Orleans using RT-qPCR and sequencing. Additional stool specimens from outbreaks in 2015 in North Carolina were classified in a similar manner as GII.4 Sydney and GII.3 were obtained for inclusivity/exclusivity testing. These were provided courtesy of S.R. Greene (North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Raleigh, NC). Because the samples were provided de-identified, they were exempt from NCSU IRB review, and their use in the study was consistent with institutional biosafety committee certifications. Stool specimens were diluted to 20% (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2), divided into minimal use aliquots, and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. Frozen animal cell culture lysates of poliovirus 1, feline calicivirus, Tulane virus, and hepatitis A virus that are routinely used in our laboratory were used in exclusivity studies. Adenovirus 41 strain Tak (VR-930D), bacteriophage MS2 (15597-B1), Escherichia coli [(Migula) Castellani and Chalmers strain C3000 (15597)], and Enterobacter cloacae subsp. Cloacae [(Jordan) Hormaeche and Edwards (13047)] obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were also used. For those studies, genomic nucleic acids from all samples were extracted using the NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG system (bioMerieux SA, Marcy l\u2032 Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All extracted nucleic acids were aliquoted into minimal use volumes and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use.",
