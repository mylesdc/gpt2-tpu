DTMUV infection mainly results in significant decreases in egg production in egg-laying ducks within 1-2 weeks post infection. However, information on the comparative protein expression of host tissues in response to DTMUV infection is limited. In the present study, the cellular protein response to DTMUV infection in duck ovarian follicles was analyzed using nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed 131 differentially expressed proteins, among which 53 were up regulated and 78 were down regulated. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and mitochondrial pathway. Some selected proteins that were found to be regulated in DTMUV-infected tissues were screened by quantitative real-time PCR to examine their regulation at the transcriptional level, western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of some selected proteins on translational level. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the proteomic changes in duck ovarian follicles following DTMUV infection. The protein-related information obtained in this study may be useful to understand the host response to DTMUV infection and the inherent mechanism of DTMUV replication and pathogenicity.",

In addition to ducks, the disease has also affected geese, chickens, and sparrows. The infected ducks exhibited high fever, diarrhea, and other consistent signs including acute anorexia, antisocial behavior, rhinorrhea, ataxia, and paralysis (Su et al., 2011) . Necropsy of the infected ducks consistently displayed severe ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis, and regression. In addition, ruptured ovarian follicles and peritonitis were also found in some infected ducks, whereas enlarged spleen and leg muscle hemorrhage were occasionally noted. The infected egg-laying ducks presented a significant reduction in egg production from 20 to 60%, and even up to 90% in some reported cases, within 1-2 weeks postinfection , thus causing a severe impact on poultry production and heavy economic losses in China.",

Similar to other flaviviruses, TMUV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, with a genome of approximately 10.5 kb and a single open reading frame encoding a large polyprotein (Su et al., 2011) . The polyprotein can be cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins (capsid [C] ; membrane [M] , and envelope [E] ) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5; Sun et al., 2014) .

A virus infection may produce dramatic effects on the host cell morphology, transcription and translation patterns, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, innate immune response of the host, and apoptosis pathways, and may also cause inflammation and alter stress responses (Zheng J. et al., 2011) . As a result, many functional and morphological changes in the host cells are associated with significant changes in the patterns of expression of host cell genes. Therefore, information on proteome changes in the host following DTMUV infection may be crucial to understand the host response to the virus and viral pathogenesis. In recent times, comparative proteomic analysis has emerged as a valuable tool for the establishment of global host protein profile in response to virus infection. This technique has been used to investigate the proteome changes in cells infected in vitro with classical swine fever virus (Li et al., 2010) , infectious bursal disease virus (Zheng et al., 2008) , and porcine circovirus (Liu et al., 2014) . In addition, this analysis has also been widely employed to examine the mechanisms of viral infection through comparative investigation of the proteome changes in the host tissue in response to infection in vivo, such as Marek's disease virus (Lu et al., 2010) and infectious bronchitis virus (Cao et al., 2012) .",

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the changes in the host tissues in response to DTMUV infection. Thus, the knowledge on proteins involved in these cellular responses to DTMUV infection and the directional changes in protein expression is limited. Label-free proteomic analysis based on nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is emerging as a powerful methodology to determine disease-specific targets. When compared with conventional proteomic technologies, the major advantage of this technique is sensitivity, with thousands of proteins directly identified in typical analyses. In addition, lowabundance proteins can be detected and quantitative information can be acquired from the spectral counts obtained for each peptide sequence (Kikuchi et al., 2012) . In this study, we present the results of a label-free quantitative proteomic comparison of the proteome of DTMUV-infected versus mock-infected duck ovarian follicles. Analysis of the obtained data revealed major changes in the proteins involved in central cellular signaling, metabolic pathways, and immune responses. Some individual proteins that were found to be regulated were further validated using qRT-PCR and immunoblotting techniques.",

Furthermore, a lack of increase in body weight, greenish diarrhea, keratitis, and tearing were noted in the infected ducks. With the disease progression, some ducks exhibited abnormal gait and were unable to stand steadily and kept falling. Contrastingly, the mock-infected ducks remained healthy. The gross lesions of the sacrificed DTMUV-infected ducks mainly comprised severe ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis, and regression consistently. In addition, ruptured ovarian follicles and peritonitis were also found. Although the viral RNAs were readily detected in the ovaries of the DTMUV-infected birds sacrificed on 3 and 5 dpi, they were not observed on 7 and 10 dpi ( Table 1) .

Ovaries play an important role in laying trait. It has been reported that DTMUV affects both meat and laying ducks, significantly reducing egg production ranging from 20 to 60%, and even up to 90%, in the farms of eastern China . At necropsy, the infected ducks displayed severe ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis, and regression consistently. DTMUV infection may cause dramatic changes in the function and morphology of the host tissues, and even alter the expression of the host cell genes. Recently, increasing attentions have been focused on the interaction between flavivirus and host (Zheng J. et al., 2011) . However, there are none studies that have been performed to analyze this interaction using proteomics methods. Two-dimensional LC-MS/MS enables identification of proteins in a complex mixture by using a combination of HPLC and MS after tryptic proteolysis, and is a powerful method for investigating disease biomarkers (Bartel et al., 2011) . In the present study, two-dimensional LC-MS/MS proteomics was used to compare the total proteomes in the DTMUV-infected ovarian follicles with those in the normal ovarian follicle tissues. Quantitative analysis demonstrated dysregulation of 131 proteins in the DTMUV-infected ovarian follicles (53 up regulated and 78 down regulated proteins). The differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular biosynthesis, signal transduction, stress response, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), and metabolic enzymes. All of these results indicate that the development of DTMUV in ovarian follicles is a process that involves multiple factors, in which many proteins and pathways are involved and where binding functions are greatly affected by pathogenesis.",

In the present study, the abundance of some proteins associated with carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolic processes was found to be differentially altered in the DTMUV-infected group. In addition, we identified changes in the abundance of energy metabolism proteins, including \u03b2-citrate lyase, deoxycytidylate deaminase, mitochondrial ATP synthase and \u03b3glutamyl hydrolase, which were up regulated following DTMUV infection. Moreover, down regulation of enzymes, such as proline synthase, serpin b6, NADH dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase was also observed in the DTMUV-infected group. Mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis using an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane during oxidative phosphorylation (Devenish et al., 2000) . It is constitutively expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane in normal cells and is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions (Maguire et al., 2006) . Abnormal expression of ATP synthase is found to be involved in cell dysfunction and tumorigenesis (L\u00f3pez-R\u00edos et al., 2007) . Recently, ATP synthase was reported as a proviral factor that can promote replication of herpes simplex virus-1 (Zheng S. et al., 2011) and H3N2 swine influenza virus . Thus, the increased ATP synthase expression observed in the present study may possibly contribute to virus replication.

After tissue lysis, equal amount of protein sample (50 \u00b5g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was then performed using antibodies to these proteins. The \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control to normalize the quantitative data. (B) results derived from western blot analysis were compared with those from MS analysis. the accumulated citrate in the cytoplasm (Qian et al., 2015) . In the flavivirus Hepatitis C virus (HCV), this enzyme is required for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and is induced during the initial stages of high-level HCV replication. In addition, more considerable evidence suggests that the cholesterol and fattyacid-biosynthesis pathways may play a role in HCV replication and infection (Kapadia and Chisari, 2005) . Meanwhile, the down-regulation of proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle suggests that DTMUV infection reduces energy metabolism of the infected cells. This finding is consistent with some previous reports (Fan et al., 2012; Pando-Robles et al., 2014) , demonstrating that DTMUV infection promotes changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics, causing an increase in cellular oxygen consumption and decreased efficiency in ATP synthesis (El-Bacha et al., 2007) . However, the functional implications of these changes have not been demonstrated and need further research.",

In the present study, we noted altered expression of several proteins following DTMUV infection, including down-regulation of two eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIF4 and eIF4H) and c-mycbinding protein and up-regulation of 26s proteasome. The protein eIF4H stimulates protein biosynthesis, ATP hydrolysis, and helicase activity of eIF4A (Bartel et al., 2011) . The eukaryotic initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (eIF4G3) is critical for the initiation of protein translation. The eIF4G3 protein is a central player in the initiation of translation since it also contains binding domains for mRNA, eIF4A, and eIF3. It has been reported that many viruses cleave eIF4G3 to stop host protein translation (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2011) . For example, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses shut off host protein synthesis by cleaving eIF4G3, resulting in inhibition of cap-dependent translation (Svitkin et al., 1999) .

            "text": "The abundance of several proteins involved in immune response as well as antigen processing and presentation were also altered following DTMUV infection. The IFIT protein family, comprising IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5, is characterized by multiple repeats of tetratricopeptide repeat helix-turn-helix motifs that mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions . These proteins are distinctly induced by type I and II interferons and viruses, which are less abundantly expressed under normal conditions and are mainly concentrated in actin-rich protrusions and apical cell surfaces (Hsu et al., 2013) . The IFITs are conserved in mammals, amphibians and fishes, but do not exist in lower animals. In birds, only IFIT5 has been detected (Zhou et al., 2013) , and knowledge on its function is very limited. Recently, some reports have indicated that IFIT5 enhances NF-\u03baB activation through increased phosphorylation and activation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK; Yamamoto and Gaynor, 2004) . IKK catalyzes stimulus-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitinmediated degradation of I\u03baB proteins, subsequently activating NF-\u03baB. Further research has suggested that IFIT5 interacts with both IKK and TGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; Fan et al., 2011) . Moreover, IFIT5 facilitates the interaction between TAK1 and IKK that contributes to IKK phosphorylation. Zhang et al. (2013) reported that IFIT5 was significantly induced at both mRNA and protein levels upon Sendai virus infection, and that the host antiviral responses were markedly enhanced or impaired in the presence or absence of IFIT5, respectively. In the present study, we detected up-regulation of IFIT5 following DTMUV infection in the ovarian follicles, however, its role in antiviral process and immune regulation requires further investigation.",

The oligomerized OAS protein generates 2 \u2032 -5 \u2032 -linked oligoadenylate (2-5A), activating endoribonuclease and RNase L (Pulit-Penaloza et al., 2012) . It has been demonstrated that RNase L contributes to the control of early spread of virus by degrading the viral RNA and activating cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors, including RIG-I and MDA-5 (Zhu et al., 2014) . Recently, the OAS family proteins were noted to show RNase-L-dependent antiviral activity against dengue virus, West Nile virus, HCV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Deo et al., 2014) , all of which belong to the family Flaviviridae. Thus, the OASL screened in the present study may be associated with differential susceptibility to the clinical outcomes of Tembusu virus infection.",

Also, we have shown that infection of ovarian follicles induces changes in expression of 131 proteins. Our data revealed significant changes in the proteins associated with energy metabolism, RNA processing and translation machinery, host cytoskeleton, and immune response. The modulation of protein expression found in our study may attribute to the strategy of the virus to overcome host pathways to facilitate survival at the expense of the host. Further, studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanism by which these proteins are induced during viral infection. Virus could make use of the transcription and translation of some host products for their survival, but the detailed mechanism is still unknown. The modulation of protein expression could also be the host's response to the viral infection. It would be interesting in a further study, to determine whether a similar response could occur in cells infected with other viruses or if the observed modulation of protein expression is specifically induce in response to DTMUV infection. Improvements in our knowledge on target organ will be important to decipher the infection process of Tembusu virus in ducks.",
