In vitro studies indicate this virus may have a broad host range suggesting an increased pandemic potential. Genetic and epidemiological evidence indicate camels serve as a reservoir for MERS virus but the mechanism of cross species transmission is unclear and many questions remain regarding the susceptibility of humans to infection. Deep sequencing data was obtained from the nasal samples of three camels that had been experimentally infected with a human MERS-CoV isolate. A majority of the genome was covered and average coverage was greater than 12,000x depth. Although only 5 mutations were detected in the consensus sequences, 473 intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified. Many of these variants were present at high frequencies and could potentially influence viral phenotype and the sensitivity of detection assays that target these regions for primer or probe binding.",

Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, MERS-CoV infections have been detected in 23 countries with local transmission occurring in over half of the affected countries [1] . Although the mortality rate is high (about 40%), subclinical infections may be more prevalent than severe disease, which occurs mainly in elderly individuals and those with pre-existing conditions. Serologic, genetic, epidemiological, and animal infection studies indicate that dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) serve as a reservoir for human infection [2] [3] [4] . Seropositive assay results have been obtained from DC samples collected throughout the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa, including regions where no human cases have been detected [5] , however, assay results may be impacted by the presence of cross reactive coronavirus antibodies [1] . Experimental infection of DCs resulted in a selflimiting upper respiratory infection with viral shedding occurring primarily through nasal secretions [2] .",

Nasal swabs were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-infection from three camels experimentally infected at Colorado State University with MERS-CoV strain HCo-V-EMC/2012, as described in Adney et al., 2014 [2] . The viral stock used for the infections was provided with the permission of the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and had been propagated in Vero E6 cells. Vero passage 7 of HCoV-EMC/2012 (\"Seed\") was used for the camel infections and served as the pre-in vivo passage tissue culture control. No additional cell culture passages were performed as a control for the subsequent passage of the virus from Vero cells into camels. MERS-CoV was obtained from BEI Resources (EMC/2012, NR-44260) for generation of viral cDNA for testing of PCR primers prior to the arrival of nasal samples and seed stock. Note, the number assigned to each camel in this study differ from those assigned to the same camels in Adney et al. [2] (work performed at Colorado State University (CSU)).

Variants showing up in 2 or more samples and for which there was at least 100 overlapping read pairs (ORP) were detected in each sample, and were detected at 473 positions in the genome; further analysis was prioritized for these sites. All primers were screened against the reads to trim primer sequences at the ends of reads using fastq-mcf [16] and default parameters. Genomic regions overlapping primer regions were examined separately to consider the potential for un-trimmed primer errors to remain in reads mapped to the reference genome.

Discrepancies in overlap product sizes were noted in some primer sets covering the last 4000 nts of the genome. These products were sequenced via Sanger sequencing and this confirmed that the primers bound to and amplified the correct area of the genome, however in some cases the amplified sequence terminated unexpectedly resulting in a truncated sequence output.

Thus some of the detected mutations could originate from viral genomes that are unable to replicate and persist in isolation. To reduce the emphasis of mutations associated with limited functional relevance, the analysis focused on iSNVs found in high abundance and/or present in two or more samples, and because multiple time points (days 1, 3, and 5) were analyzed for each camel, our analyses favored genomes that persisted during the infection. The expectation is that even when a viral genome is unable to replicate independent of the surrounding population, its presence at sufficient abundance could imply a functional role in the evolution of viral quasispecies. For example, it has previously been shown that defective genomes may function as \"defective interfering particles\" and may impact viral infection dynamics such as viral persistence [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, it is important to consider that mutations that are observed at ultra-low abundance and occur rarely could represent viruses with limited functional impact.",

Samples were checked for their coverage and a binomial model (p<0.01) was used to determine whether a rare variant should be detected in a sample with the available coverage.

Ka/Ks ratios were calculated for each sample using the KaKs calculator [36] . To calculate the ratio for each gene in each sample, the consensus sequence was compared with a concatenation of the rare variants, which are treated as a second sequence. Only one gene in one sample (C2D1, M pro) showed significant divergence from 1 (Ka/Ks = 1.49, p-value < 0.05). Thus, there appeared to be limited evidence for an identifiable selective pressure on the sub-population of each sample.",

Previously NGS was used to rapidly obtain consensus sequences of multiple MERS-CoV samples [9] . Unexpectedly, analysis of the consensus sequence data revealed the presence of MERS-CoV variants at relatively high frequencies, thus leading the authors to speculate about the role of viral quasispecies in cross-species transmission. Results of the present study demonstrate the value of ultra-deep Illumina sequencing for identification of both rare and high frequency variants present in the nasal samples of three camels that had been experimentally infected with a human isolate of MERS-CoV [2] .",

            "text": "Infection of camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV induced numerous high frequency iSNVs throughout the genome upon a single passage in camels. This indicates that MERS-CoV, similar to other coronaviruses, is prone to extreme genetic diversity in intrahost viral populations that may change rapidly in response to a change in host environment [9, 11, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Until patterns of variation are defined for quasispecies present in non-laboratory passaged MERS-CoV samples, design of reagents for detecting MERS-CoV infections will be vulnerable to the effects of intrahost genetic diversity on reagent sensitivity. For example, at nt 2966, there is an iSNV present at 4% for Seed but greater than 20% in samples from all 3 camels indicating that this iSNV may be selected for in camels. Interestingly, an NCBI Blast search of the 60 nt region including this iSNV site revealed no indication of variability at this site for any of the 99 MERS virus sequences that were present on GenBank. This mutation, although present in a high proportion of the intrahost populations, would not be included in Genbank consensus sequences that are used to identify conserved regions for primer design and thus has the potential to interfere with viral detection assays that include this nt position. Indeed, only 5 mutations were detected in the consensus sequences, although 473 intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified. Many of these variants were present at high frequencies and could potentially influence viral phenotype and adversely affect the sensitivity of detection assays that target these regions for primer or probe binding. Table. Frequency of consensus and iSNV nts, and position coverage based on ORP data (non primer regions). The iSNV data is distributed between two spreadsheets, the first, S2A Table, shows all iSNVs that detected outside of the primer regions, and the second, S3 Table, shows iSNVs occurring in primer regions. iSNVs detected within primer sites were examined separately to consider the potential for un-trimmed primer errors to remain in reads mapped to the reference genome. In total this table consists of approx. 2000 rows of iSNV data and is available on request as an Excel spreadsheet. (XLSX) S3 Table.

An iSNV, g24538, was present at low frequency in the Seed stock but increased in frequency during propagation in camels with a change in consensus sequence occurring in C2D5, resulting in an N1028S mutation. Note, only data from samples with adequate coverage at the relevant iSNV position were included in the histogram.",
