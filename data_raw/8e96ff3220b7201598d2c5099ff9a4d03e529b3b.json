            "text": "Toona sinensis Roem is a popular leafy vegetable in Chinese cuisine and is also used as a traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, leaf samples were collected from the same plant on two development stages and then used for high-throughput Illumina RNAsequencing (RNA-Seq). 125,884 transcripts and 54,628 unigenes were obtained through de novo assembly. A total of 25,570 could be annotated with known biological functions, which indicated that the T. sinensis leaves and shoots were undergoing multiple developmental processes especially for active metabolic processes. Analysis of differentially expressed unigenes between the two libraries showed that the lysine biosynthesis was an enriched KEGG pathway, and candidate genes involved in the lysine biosynthesis pathway in T. sinensis leaves and shoots were identified. Our results provide a primary analysis of the gene expression files of T. sinensis leaf and shoot on different development stages and afford a valuable resource for genetic and genomic research on plant lysine biosynthesis.",

Roem (also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to the family Meliaceae), a perennial hardwood referred to as Xiangchun in Chinese and Chinese Mahogany in English, is a native plant found in Asia. Its edible young leaves are consumed as a nutritious vegetable known as Xiangchun Ya in China due to their unique aromatic flavor and abundance of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants [1, 2] . The leaves of T. sinensis are also employed in Chinese traditional medicine to treat diarrhea, chronic dysentery, bloody stool, seminal emissions, leucorrhoea, and metrorrhagia [1] . More recently, various other biological properties discovered in the T. sinensis leaf extracts have been reported, including antioxidant [3] , anticancer [4] , anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic [5] , and antineoplastic [6] effects, as well as antiatherosclerotic potential [7] , inhibitory effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication, antitumor effects [8] , and even inhibitory effects against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus [9] .",

Lysine is one of the most limited essential amino acids in vegetative foods consumed by humans and livestock. In addition to serving as a necessary building block for all proteins, lysine also plays a major role in regulating plant growth and responses to the environment as an important signaling amino acid [12] .

All three carry out the same upstream pathway from aspartate to tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) through the sequential action of aspartate kinase (LysC), aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Asd), dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DapA) and dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DapB), and the same final reaction from mesodiaminopimelate (m-DAP) to lysine catalyzed by m-DAP decarboxylase (LysA) [35] . The differences between them lie in the reactions at the center of the pathway from THDPA to m-DAP. Lysine biosynthesis in plants is known to utilize the intermediate diaminopimelic acid (DAP). The first type of pathway to have been discovered carried out four sequential reaction steps firstly through a succinyl-CoA-dependent transferase (DapD) or is acetylated by acetyl-CoA-dependent transferase, then DapC (a Glu-dependent type of transamination), and desuccinylase (DapE) to form LL-diaminopimelate (LL-DAP), and an epimerase (DapF) finally converts LL-DAP to m-DAP. Another DAP pathway utilizes m-DAP dehydrogenase (Ddh) to convert THDPA to m-DAP, shortening the central portion of the pathway from four steps to one. A third DAP pathway identified in plant utilizes LL-DAP aminotransferase (LL-DAP-AT/DapL), which specifically catalyzes the interconversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate and LL-diaminopimelate, a reaction requiring three enzymes in the DAP pathway.",

The seven unigenes, including LysC, Asd, DapA, DapB, DapL and LysA, were all upregulated in the leaves and shoots collected in April. The obtained results showed that the leaves collected in April were rich in several essential amino acids, especially lysine, which showed significantly higher levels, consistent with the results of nutrient analysis [10, 38] . Animals cannot produce lysine, and they therefore must rely on a dietary source, which is derived primarily from crop plants. Because some crops do not accumulate sufficient lysine to allow them to be used as complete nutritional sources, there has been significant interest in improving nutritional quality by enhancing lysine content [39] . Thus, if T. sinensis can accumulate high levels of lysine, it will become an interesting crop, both for research on lysine synthesis and for quality improvement. It is known that, in plants, the control of lysine homeostasis is complex and plays a role as significant as that of biosynthesis [13, 40] . In the description of our transcriptome, most of the catabolic genes associated with plant lysine synthesis were identified, demonstrating our understanding of the exact pathway present in plants [35] . Recent genetic, molecular, and biochemical evidence suggests that lysine synthesis and catabolism are regulated by novel concerted mechanisms [38] . The recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of lysine metabolism in plants may also prove valuable information for the future production of high-lysine crops.",

A total of 25,570 could be annotated with known biological functions. 12,097 unigenes were assigned to 5 main categories, including 123 KEGG pathways. Based on similarities to known proteins, proteins involved in primary metabolite biosynthesis were identified, including proteins related to carbohydrate, amino acid, energy, and lipid biosynthesis. Analysis of differentially expressed unigenes between the two libraries showed that the lysine biosynthesis was an enriched KEGG pathway, and candidate genes involved in the lysine biosynthesis pathway in T. sinensis leaves and shoots were identified. This research is essential and useful for understanding the transcriptome characteristics of T. sinensis. The results obtained from this study will also serve as a useful genomic dataset to accelerate research on metabolic mechanisms and functional genomics in T. sinensis.",
