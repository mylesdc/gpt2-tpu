Flotillin expression is increased under pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Despite their importance for signal transduction, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of flotillins. Here, we analyzed the expression of flotillins at transcriptional level and identified flotillins as downstream targets of the mitogen activated kinases ERK1/2. The promoter activity of flotillins was increased upon growth factor stimulation in a MAPK dependent manner. Overexpression of serum response factor or early growth response gene 1 resulted in increased flotillin mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, both promoter activity and expression of endogenous flotillins were increased upon treatment with retinoic acid or by overexpression of the retinoid X receptor and its binding partners RARa and PPARc. Our data indicate that the expression of flotillins, which can be detected in all cultured cells, is fine-tuned in response to various external stimuli. This regulation may be critical for the outcome of signaling cascades in which flotillins are known to be involved.",

            "text": "One major function of lipid rafts is to organize signaling partners into functional complexes [8] . Within rafts, flotillins have been suggested to provide platforms for the assembly of signaling molecules and thus function as regulators of several signal transduction pathways associated with membrane receptors, e.g. insulin [9] , IgE receptor [10] , IL-6/STAT3 signaling [11] , G protein coupled receptor [12] and of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. Furthermore, we have recently shown that flotillin-1 is crucial for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling through the epidermal growth factor (EGF) [13] and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors [14] and thereby regulates the MAP kinase signaling [13] . In the case of all signal transduction pathways in which flotillins are known to be involved, the absence of flotillins leads to a severe impairment of the signaling cascade [10] [11] [12] [13] . During EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling, the absence of flotillin-1 results in reduced phosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the EGFR and in inefficient activation of the downstream mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and Akt signaling [13] . The cellular activation ERK1/2 is preceded by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR) by growth factors, which is followed by the binding of the SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb2 in association with the guanine exchange factor SOS, activation of Ras and subsequently of the serine-threonine kinase Raf. Active Raf kinase phosphorylates MEK1/2 which in turn phosphorylate ERK1/2 on both tyrosine and threonine residues.",

            "text": "Because of their ability to modulate the outcome of signaling cascades and to stimulate cell proliferation [15, 18, 25] , cell spreading [26] and filopodia formation [4, 27] , which are processes important during carcinogenesis and metastasis formation, the correct cellular amount of flotillins is crucial for the ability of a cell to react on certain external stimuli (e.g. growth factors) and to maintain a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Thus, the regulation of the expression of flotillins in order to allow for the cells to adapt to environmental clues is of major importance. Nevertheless, very little information is available on factors that regulate flotillins at transcriptional level. Flotillin-2 was described to be a target gene of the p53 transcription factor family members p63 and p73, but not of p53 itself [11] . Lopez-Casas et al. [28] showed that flotillin-1 mRNA is upregulated upon increasing cell density in 3T3 fibroblasts. They isolated a fragment of the promoter of murine flotillin-1 and identified putative binding sites for Sp1, AmL-1a, MZF1, c-Ets1, and Lyf-1 in the genomic sequence within about 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Unfortunately, the functional role of none of these transcription factors in the regulation of flotillin-1 transcription was analyzed further. In microarray experiments, both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 were found to be upregulated upon stimulation of myeloid progenitor cells with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine that leads to differentiation of progenitor cells into neutrophilic granulocytes in a STAT3dependent process [29] . In drosophila, flotillin-2 has recently been shown to be transcriptionally regulated upon embryonic wound response [30] .",

In this cascade, flotillin-1 forms a molecular complex with EGFR, but also with CRAF, MEK1, ERK1/2 and KSR1, thus putatively working as a novel MAPK scaffolder [13] . Because of the essential role of flotillin-1 in EGF receptor signaling, we analyzed if the expression of flotillins themselves is regulated by growth factors such as EGF. For this, the luciferase reporter assay with flotillin promoter constructs was performed in EGF stimulated cells. In the case of flotillin-1, constructs F1-2600 and F1-1330 were significantly activated by EGF as compared to the unstimulated cells, whereas the shorter ones showed no significant activation ( Fig. 2A, left) . Similarly, the 3 longest promoter constructs of flotillin-2 were significantly activated by EGF ( Fig. 2A, right) . Interestingly, the three longest flotillin-1 and all four flotillin-2 constructs displayed a basal activity even in unstimulated cells, as compared to the cells transfected with the control vector. To check if the EGF induced increase in the flotillin promoter activity was due to activation of the MAPKs ERK1/2, we used an inhibitor specific for the MAPK kinases MEK1/2, which reside immediately upstream of ERK1/2 in the pathway and are essential for ERK1/2 activation. Incubation of the cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 not only completely abolished the stimulatory effect of EGF, but also significantly suppressed the basal promoter activity. This indicates that already the basal expression of flotillins is in part dependent on the MAPKs ERK1/2. This effect was particularly strong for flotillin-1, which itself modulates MAPK signaling. Based on the above data, flotillins thus can be added to the list of ERK1/2 regulated genes.",

PMA is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC), a Ser/Thr kinase family with a role in cell growth, proliferation and tumorigenesis [35] . Activation of PKC leads to activation of cRaf and, hence, to a downstream activation of ERK1/2. Stimulation with PMA resulted in a strong activation of the three longest flotillin-1 promoter constructs and of all four flotillin-2 promoter constructs (Fig. 2B) , very similarly to EGF. Since the second longest flotillin-1 and longest flotillin-2 promoter construct gave the strongest activation in the above experiments, we used these two constructs in most of the further studies. Stimulation of the cells with either bFGF which activates ERK1/2 and PI3K through the FGF receptor activation (Fig. 2C ) or with FCS (Fig. 2D) , which contains a mixture of growth factors, also resulted in an increased promoter activity which was more pronounced for flotillin-1 than for flotillin-2. In fact, a significant activation by FGF was only observed with flotillin-1 whereas flotillin-2 activation remained just below the significance level (p = 0.09). However, FCS-induced activation was significant for both flotillins. In summary, the promoters of both flotillins are activated by several stimuli that all derive from an upstream activation of ERK1/2.",

Elk1 forms heterodimers with the serum response factor SRF and binds to the serum response element in the promoter region of its target genes.

In line with the promoter data, stimulation with retinoic acid led to an increase in flotillin protein expression, especially in RXRa transfected cells (Fig. 7 A-C, densitometric quantification in 7D-E). In addition, overexpression of either RARa or PPARc resulted in an increased flotillin expression on mRNA level (Fig. 7F) . In summary, both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 contain functional binding sites for RXR and its binding partners and, hence, can be classified as retinoic acid responsive genes. To directly show that the transcription factors RARa, RXRa and Egr1 bind to flotillin promoters, we performed chromatin IP (ChIP) assays with antibodies specific for RARa, RXRa and Egr1, and isotype-matched control antibodies. PCR primers amplifying approximately 400 bp of the genomic region of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 upstream of the ATG start codon were used for the detection of the precipitated DNA fragment (Fig. 8) . RXRa and Egr1 were found to bind to promoters of both flotillins, whereas RAR only bound to flotillin-2 promoter, consistent with the overexpression data shown in Fig. 6B .",

Similar to the results obtained with the human constructs, stimulation with EGF, retinoic acid, PMA, or troglitazone resulted in an increased activity of the murine promoter constructs (Fig. 9A and B) .

To show that the identified binding sites for these factors in the flotillin promoters are required for the transcriptional activation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. Since the number of the binding sites in human flotillin promoters is too high to be feasible for these studies (see Table 3 ), we mutated the sites in the mouse flotillin-2 proximal promoter construct which contains 2 sites for Egr1 and 3 sites for the RXR family (Fig. 10A) . The RXR binding sites were individually mutated using extension overlap PCR [31] , whereas the Egr1 binding sites which are located close to each other and to the 39 end of the promoter sequence were deleted. We also produced constructs in which individual RXR site mutations were combined with a 39 deletion. As shown in Fig. 10B , deletion of the Egr1 binding sites severely impaired PMA-mediated transcriptional activation, although it did not completely prevent it. Single mutation of the RXR family binding sites did not abrogate the transcriptional activation of the reporter constructs upon RA stimulation (Data not shown). However, when the mutations of the RXR binding sites 2 and 3 were combined with a deletion in the 39 region removing the Egr1 binding sites, the transcriptional activation induced by retinoic acid was completely abolished (Fig. 10C) . This seems not to be due to the absence of the 39 region as such, since the Erg1 site deletion construct exhibited a significant albeit reduced transcriptional activation and lower basal activity. Interestingly, the basal activity of the RXR site mutant constructs was also drastically reduced (Fig. 10C) . In summary, our data show that RXR and Egr1 families are involved in the transcriptional regulation of flotillins across the species.",

Until now, the transcriptional regulation of flotillin expression is only poorly understood, despite their important functions in various signaling pathways and their altered expression in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we have performed an analysis of the transcriptional regulation of human and mouse flotillins, with focus on the proximal promoter regions of the respective genes. Although we here show that these regions contain important regulatory sequences that control flotillin expression, it is possible that the genomic sequences further upstream or the intron of flotillins contain additional cis regulatory elements that were not identified by our study.",

Importantly, we also demonstrate that this regulation is conserved among species. In the light of our recent findings that flotillin-1 is an important regulator of MAPK signaling [13] , the finding that flotillin expression is controlled by MAPKs, most likely through Egr1 and SRF activation, is especially intriguing. The MAPK pathway plays a central role in a variety of signaling networks and mediates many of the intracellular actions of e.g. growth factors. It is widely accepted that aberrant signaling can lead to malignant transformation of cells and to carcinogenesis, as has been shown e.g. for overexpressed EGFR [37] . The MAPK family members extracellularly regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 represent targets at which signals from different growth factor receptors converge. In quiescent cells, ERK1/2 are mainly located in the cytoplasm where they are bound to MEK1/2. The nuclear export signal of MEK1/2 prevents the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 [38] . Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2 is necessary for the dissociation of the MEK/ERK complex. Since our recent data show that flotillin-1 is a novel MAPK scaffolder that is essential for full ERK activation and directly interacts with both MEK1 and ERK2 [13] , it may also regulate the localization of the MEK/ ERK complex. Thus, transcriptional regulation of flotillins by MAPK pathway might provide a feedback loop that affects the activation status and duration of MAPK signaling.",

Elk-1 is one of the beststudied ERK1/2-activated transcription factors and belongs to the group of Ets ternary complex factors (overview in [44] ). Direct phosphorylation of Elk-1 at the C-terminus by ERK1/2 occurs rapidly at six sites [45] . In addition, a MAPK-independent phosphorylation of Elk-1 in response to FGF stimulation or Raf activation has been described [46] . Elk-1 forms a complex with serum response factor (SRF) and binds to the serum response element (SRE) in promoters of several immediate early genes such as c-Fos [47] or Egr1 [48] . SRF is essential for the activation through the SRE, since mutations that abolish the SRF-binding inhibit the activation of gene expression [49] . The SRF gene itself is induced in response to serum stimulation [50] . ERK1/2 are important contributors to cell proliferation, since common downstream targets of the three ERK1/2 substrates c-Fos, Elk-1, and c-Myc are genes that regulate cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1 (summarized in [51] ). In line with this, we recently found that flotillins are needed for cyclin D1 expression, since a knockdown of flotillin-1 in HeLa cells resulted in a reduced basal as well as EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression [13] and also in an arrest of the cell cycle in G1 (our unpublished observations), indicating that flotillins are needed for a sustained signaling downstream of ERK1/2. In general, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is associated with increased proliferation, and a dysregulation thereof is a hallmark of many tumors. In fact, activating mutations of upstream components of ERK1/2 are responsible for many human cancers, as summarized in [52] .",

In this study, we show that all these stimuli also result in flotillin promoter activation, further pointing to ERK1/2 and Egr1 as important regulators of flotillin expression.",

Accordingly, overexpression of SRF in HeLa cells results in an increased expression of Egr1 (our unpublished data). Egr1 controls the expression of a large number of target genes, most of which are related to cell growth and apoptosis, such as p53, TGF\u00df1 and PTEN [57] [58] [59] . In addition, Egr1 downregulates its own expression [60] , resulting in termination of Egr1regulated gene expression, thus making sure that the signaling is only transient. The potential role of Egr1 in cancer is not fully understood, since Egr1 has been shown to either promote [61] or suppress cell proliferation and/or cancer progression in a cell and tissue specific manner (overview in [62] ). Here we show that Egr1 overexpression results in transcriptional activation of flotillins and increase in the cellular flotillin protein amount, suggesting that flotillins are Egr1-regulated genes. Furthermore, removal of the Egr1 binding sites severely impairs the PMA induced transcriptional activation of the mouse flotillin-2 gene. Further evidence for this comes from microarray analysis of Egr1 knockout MEFs in which the expression of flotillin-1 mRNA was found to be decreased [59] . This finding was not studied further by the authors, but it is well supported by our data presented here.",

However, flotillins are not the only genes under direct control of both SRF and Egr1. Transcription of the ubiquitin carrier protein (UCP) was also shown to be directly controlled by SRF and Egr1 and to be upregulated upon treatment of HeLa cells with EGF, HGF, PMA, or serum [56] , similarly to flotillins.

To confirm the reliability of our computer-based analysis, another transcription factor family whose influence on the regulation of flotillin expression appeared interesting was analyzed. Independent from the regulation of flotillins by Egr1 and SRF, flotillin promoter activity and endogenous flotillin expression were increased by the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid, which regulates gene expression by acting as a ligand for the nuclear receptors RAR (all-trans retinoic acid) and RXR (the all-trans retinoic acid metabolite 9-cis retinoic acid). Mutations of the the individual binding sites for the RXR family factors in the mouse flotillin-2 promoter did not result in reduced activation, whereas a combination with a 39 deletion removing the Egr1 binding sites completely abrogated the RA induced transcriptional response. However, since the removal of the 39 region containing the Erg1 binding sites alone did not cause an impairment of RA induced activation, the identified RXR binding sites appear to be important for the transcriptional regulation, together with the 39 region.",

            "text": "The retinoid X receptor RXR serves as an obligatory binding partner for several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily including LXR, PPAR, and RAR (reviewed in [66, 67] ). Due to its role as a heterodimerization partner, RXR is able to control the function of many nuclear receptors. The peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, PPARs, are activated by various lipids, and long-chain fatty acids most likely are their natural ligands [68] . PPARc plays a critical role in adipogenesis and fat storage [69] but also in glucose metabolism and thus in energy regulation. Nuclear receptors are of great interest for drug development and some such as PPARc are already successfully targeted by antidiabetic drugs [70] . The upregulation of flotillin expression upon retinoic acid treatment or forced expression of RAR, RXR or PPAR suggests a role for flotillins in embryogenesis, cell differentiation as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Experimental proof for the function of flotillins in all these processes already exists. The expression of flotillins depends on the differentiation status of a cell and increases during the differentiation process of osteoclasts [71] , skeletal myoblasts [72] , and 3T3 fibroblasts [1] . In drosophila, flotillins are most abundantly expressed in the embryonic nervous system [73] , suggesting a morphogenic function. The drosophila flotillin-2 gene appears to be under the control of the transcription factors of Grh, AP-1 and ETS families [30] . Overexpression of flotillin-2 in drosophila leads to abnormal morphogen distribution, impaired wing development, mislocalization of adhesion molecules, as well as to abnormalities in eyes, ocelli and bristles [74, 75] . However, flotillin-2 overexpressing flies are viable and fertile, but show a defect in the control of transcriptional response after embryonic wounding, implicating that flotillin-2 is important for the restriction of the transcriptional response in the vicinity of the wound [30] . In goldfish [2] and zebrafish [76, 77] , flotillins are involved in axonal regeneration after injury of the optic nerve and were originally discovered due to upregulation of their expression after a lesion of the goldfish optic nerve [2] . In mammals, they contribute to neurite branching and synapse formation in cultured cells [78, 79] . However, flotillin-1 [80] and flotillin-2 (our unpublished results) knockout mice are viable, fertile, and morphologically normal. Thus, some of the phenotypes observed after flotillin depletion or overexpression in cultured cells may not directly reflect the essential nature of flotillins in multicellular organisms. On the other hand, flotillins are extremely well conserved between species that are not closely related, suggesting that they are in some subtle manner important for these organisms. In our flotillin-2 knockout mice, we have observed changes in the transcription and expression of many proteins that regulate cell proliferation, adhesion and signaling (AB and RT, unpublished data). Thus, it is also possible that the loss of function of flotillins is compensated by an increased expression of e.g. signaling proteins to overcome the defects, and no obvious phenotype is observed, different from cell culture systems. Therefore, is it is likely that the true molecular functions of flotillins still remain to be discovered, and these findings stress the importance of animal models for the verification of the functional studies in cultured cells.",
