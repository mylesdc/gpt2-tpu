            "text": "Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that naturally infect many vertebrates, including humans and monkeys, and cause a wide range of clinical illnesses in humans. Infection from individual strains has conventionally been thought to be speciesspecific. Here we applied the Virochip, a pan-viral microarray, to identify a novel adenovirus (TMAdV, titi monkey adenovirus) as the cause of a deadly outbreak in a closed colony of New World monkeys (titi monkeys; Callicebus cupreus) at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Among 65 titi monkeys housed in a building, 23 (34%) developed upper respiratory symptoms that progressed to fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis, and 19 of 23 monkeys, or 83% of those infected, died or were humanely euthanized. Whole-genome sequencing of TMAdV revealed that this adenovirus is a new species and highly divergent, sharing ,57% pairwise nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses. Cultivation of TMAdV was successful in a human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, but not in primary or established monkey kidney cells. At the onset of the outbreak, the researcher in closest contact with the monkeys developed an acute respiratory illness, with symptoms persisting for 4 weeks, and had a convalescent serum sample seropositive for TMAdV. A clinically ill family member, despite having no contact with the CNPRC, also tested positive, and screening of a set of 81 random adult blood donors from the Western United States detected TMAdV-specific neutralizing antibodies in 2 individuals (2/81, or 2.5%). These findings raise the possibility of zoonotic infection by TMAdV and human-to-human transmission of the virus in the population. Given the unusually high case fatality rate from the outbreak (83%), it is unlikely that titi monkeys are the native host species for TMAdV, and the natural reservoir of the virus is still unknown. The discovery of TMAdV, a novel adenovirus with the capacity to infect both monkeys and humans, suggests that adenoviruses should be monitored closely as potential causes of cross-species outbreaks.",

The human adenoviruses in the Mastadenovirus genus, comprised of all mammalian adenoviruses, are classified into 7 species A-G, and at least 51 different serotypes (and 5 proposed types, HAdV-52 to HAdV-56) have been described to date [1, 2] . Adenoviruses are the cause of an estimated 5-10% of febrile illnesses in children worldwide [3] . Some serotypes, such as human adenovirus type 14 (HAdV- 14) , have been associated with severe and potentially fatal outbreaks of pneumonia in residential facilities and military bases [4] . Adenoviruses have also been associated with other clinical syndromes including conjunctivitis, hepatitis, and diarrhea [5] . In nonhuman primates, most epidemiologic studies of adenoviruses have focused on their identification in fecal samples from asymptomatic animals [6, 7, 8] .",

Studies of sera from animal handlers and zoo workers exposed to chimpanzees in captivity fail to detect antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses [13, 14] . However, recent serological surveys have found antibodies to New World and Old World monkey adenoviruses in donor human sera from regions where the monkeys are endemic [14, 15] . In addition, phylogenetic analyses of adenoviruses from greater apes reveal that they fall precisely into ''human'' adenoviral species B, C, and E [7] .

Routine microbiological testing for an infectious etiology was negative. We previously developed the Virochip (University of California, San Francisco) as a broad-spectrum surveillance assay for identifying viral causes of unknown acute and chronic illnesses [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . The Virochip, a pan-viral microarray containing ,19,000 probes derived from all viral species in GenBank (n,2500) [21, 23] , has been previously successful in detection of novel outbreak viruses such as the SARS coronavirus [22, 24] and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [23] . Here we apply the Virochip to identify a novel and highly divergent adenovirus as the cause of the titi monkey outbreak.

The index case, a healthy adult titi monkey, presented on May 14, 2009 with cough, lethargy, and decreased appetite (Fig. 1A, T1) . Despite aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, the animal developed severe respiratory distress and was humanely euthanized 5 days later. A second case presented 4 weeks later near the entrance to the building (Fig. 1A, T54 ). In the interim period, 3 healthy titi monkeys had been relocated from a separate building (Fig. 1A, T2 , T3, and T19), with 2 of the 3 monkeys placed into the cage formerly occupied by the index case, reflecting a total at-risk population of 68. Over the ensuing 2 months, 21 additional monkeys, including one of the relocated monkeys, presented with clinical signs similar to those shown by the index case (attack rate = 23/68, or 34%) (Figs. 1A and 1B). Clinical signs in affected animals included cough, lethargy, poor appetite, tachypnea, and abdominal breathing. These symptoms progressed to overt respiratory distress and death or humane euthanasia within an average of 8 days. Chest radiographs typically revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary changes and bronchoalveolar consolidation indicative of pneumonia, with right middle lobe predominance (Fig. 1C) . Animals displaying clinical signs were quarantined and aggressively treated by veterinarians with supplemental oxygen, anti-inflammatory medications, bronchodilators (nebulized albuterol), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antivirals (oseltamivir and/ or ribavirin). In total, 19 animals died or were euthanized due to the illness during the outbreak (case fatality rate = 19/23, or 83%). Only 4 monkeys survived, even though the majority of sick animals (17/23, or 74%) consisted of apparently healthy adults and juveniles. Interestingly, none of the 133 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) housed in the same building became sick during the outbreak, and neither did any of the Old World monkeys from surrounding outdoor colonies of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis).",

We used the Virochip, a microarray designed to detect all viruses, to identify a new species of adenovirus (TMAdV, or titi monkey adenovirus) that caused a deadly outbreak in a colony of New World titi monkeys at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), and also infected a human researcher. One-third of the monkeys developed pneumonia and liver inflammation, and 19 of 23 monkeys died or were humanely euthanized. The unusually high death rate (83%) makes titi monkeys unlikely to be natural hosts for TMAdV, and the genomic sequence of TMAdV revealed that it is very different from any other known adenovirus. The researcher developed an acute respiratory illness at the onset of the outbreak, and was found to be infected by TMAdV by subsequent antibody testing. A clinically ill family member with no prior contact with the CNPRC also tested positive. Further investigation is needed to identify whether TMAdV originated from humans, monkeys, or another animal. The discovery of TMAdV suggests that adenoviruses should be monitored closely as potential causes of crossspecies outbreaks. Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the 4 viral probes were derived from 2 different Adenoviridae genera (SAdV-23, simian adenovirus 23, PAdV-A, porcine adenovirus A, and HAdV-5, human adenovirus 5, in the Mastadenovirus genus; FAdV-D, fowl adenovirus D, in the Aviadenovirus genus), suggesting the presence of a divergent adenovirus that was not a member of any previously known species.",

De novo assembly of the complete TMAdV genome from reads that aligned to SAdV-18 was not possible due to insufficient sequence coverage (,46%). The poor apparent coverage was the result of high sequence divergence of the TMAdV genome from SAdV-18, which hindered the identification of most of the 16,524 actual deep sequencing reads derived from TMAdV (Fig. 2B, red) . Thus, after partial assembly of TMAdV using overlapping reads aligning to the SAdV-18 genome, remaining gaps were closed by specific PCR. The complete genome of TMAdV was found to be 36,842 base pairs in length, with a base composition of 20.8% A, 29.8% C, 29.8% G, and 19.6% T, and a GC content of 59.6%, comparable to that of adenoviral species Groups C, D, and E in the Mastadenovirus genus.

The placement of TMAdV into a separate group by phylogenetic analysis was also observed when looking individually at the hexon, polymerase, penton base, and fiber genes (Fig. S1 ). Scanning nucleotide pairwise identity plots revealed that, among the major adenovirus genes, the DNA polymerase and hexon are more conserved, whereas the E1A and fiber are more divergent (Fig. 4) . The significant overall sequence divergence of TMAdV from known human and simian adenoviruses is highlighted by the finding that PAdV-A (porcine adenovirus A), a non-primate mammalian adenovirus, shared only a slightly less similar whole-genome pairwise identity to TMAdV of 47.0% (Fig. 4) . In fact, in the DNA polymerase gene, TMAdV shared a pairwise identity with PAdV-A of 67.2%, comparable to its pairwise identities with the other human adenoviruses, 59%-71.7% (Figs. 4 and S1).

            "text": "In this study, we employed a pan-viral microarray assay, the Virochip, to identify a novel adenovirus associated with a fulminant pneumonia outbreak in a colony of New World titi monkeys. Despite the absence of an animal model, which precludes a strict fulfillment of Koch's postulates, there are several lines of evidence implicating this novel adenovirus, TMAdV, as the cause of the outbreak. First, conventional testing for other pathogens, including other viruses by Virochip, was negative, and affected monkeys did not respond to empiric therapy with antibiotics or antivirals (ribavirin and oseltamivir in anecdotal use are not effective against adenoviral infections) [30] . Second, the clinical presentation of pneumonia and hepatitis is consistent with the known spectrum of disease associated with adenoviral infections. Third, TMAdV sequence was recovered by PCR in various body fluids and tissues from affected monkeys, including blood, respiratory secretions, and lung/liver tissue (Table 1) . Fourth, the finding of intranuclear inclusions in diseased tissues, as well as direct visualization of adenoviral-like particles (TMAdV) in lung alveoli by electron microscopy (Figs. 1D-2 to 1D-4) , support a primary role for TMAdV in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in affected monkeys. Finally, there was a significant neutralizing Ab response in surviving animals, with 2 monkeys having titers undetectable prior to the outbreak but rising to .1:512 at convalescence (Fig. 6) . Although TMAdV retains the core genomic features common to all adenoviruses (Fig. 2C) , phylogenetic analysis clearly places TMAdV within a separate branch, with no closely related neighbors (Figs. 3 and S1) . A phylogenetic distance of .10% combined with the lack of cross-neutralization defines TMAdV as a new species [31] . Since emerging adenovirus strains such as HAdV-14 and HAdV-D22/H8 (otherwise known as HAdV-D53) are known to arise from recombination events among related ancestral strains [32, 33] , we performed bootscanning analysis to look for such events in TMAdV. The bootscanning analysis, however, failed to show evidence of recombination, likely because closely related and/or ancestral strains to TMAdV have not yet been identified.",

            "text": "Entry of adenoviruses into cells involves an initial attachment of the fiber knob to the cell receptor, followed by internalization via a secondary interaction of the penton base with a v integrins [34, 35] . The presence of an RGD motif in the TMAdV penton base implies that the virus uses a v integrins for internalization [35] . However, the high sequence divergence in the fiber protein (Table  2) , as well as the absence of fiber motifs conserved among adenoviruses that bind CAR [36, 37] (coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor) or CD46 [38, 39, 40] (data not shown), suggest that neither of these two human adenoviral receptors may be the attachment receptor for TMAdV. Further studies will be necessary to identify the preferred cellular attachment and internalization receptors for TMAdV. Despite its isolation from affected titi monkeys, we were unable to propagate TMAdV in both established (BSC-1) and primary (PMK) monkey kidney cells (Fig. 4) . The virus, however, grew efficiently in a human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. One explanation for this finding is that TMAdV may be unable to productively infect cells derived from Old World monkeys (e.g. rhesus and African green monkeys). An alternative possibility is that successful propagation of TMAdV may depend on infection of a specific host cell type, such as A549 lung, and not BSC-1 or PMK kidney cells. Nevertheless, after 10 passages in human A549 cells, the fully adapted strain of TMAdV exhibits an extended host range with the ability to productively infect both monkey and human cells. This observation implies that TMAdV possesses an inherent capacity to cross the species barrier and infect both humans and nonhuman primates. Efforts to identify host range and cell tropism of TMAdV, as well as the specific sequence changes responsible for adaptation to growth in cell culture, are currently underway.",

            "text": "The virulence of TMAdV in healthy and apparently immunocompetent titi monkeys (83% case fatality rate) is highly unusual for infections by adenovirus. In humans, deaths due to adenovirus infections or outbreaks are generally low (up to 18% for pneumonia associated with HAdV-14 [4] ). Furthermore, severe infections from human adenoviruses are more commonly associated with older age, immunosuppression, and chronic underlying conditions such as kidney failure [4, 41] . Young, healthy individuals are in general much less likely to succumb to adenoviral-related illness. The severity of TMAdV-related illness in affected titi monkeys suggests that this species of monkey may not be the natural host for the virus. The failure to detect fecal shedding of TMAdV in convalescent or asymptomatic animals also suggests that the virus does not normally infect titi monkeys (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Although the exact origin of TMAdV remains unclear, we can speculate on several possibilities. One possibility is that a crossspecies ''jump'' from captive macaques to a susceptible colony of titi monkeys precipitated the outbreak. As there have been no new introductions of monkeys into the closed colony for the past 2 years, this conjecture relies on asymptomatic infection and transmission of TMAdV in the captive rhesus/cynomolgus macaque population at the CNPRC. CNPRC personnel who visited macaque areas would occasionally enter titi rooms with no change in personal protective equipment, thus providing a potential route of transmission for the virus. In addition, specific antibodies were detected in 1 of 36 (2.8%) asymptomatic rhesus macaques housed in the same building (Fig. 6) , indicating that TMAdV has the capacity to infect this species of Old World monkey. Notably, the closest identified phylogenetic relative to TMAdV among the complete genomic sequences available in GenBank is a rhesus monkey adenovirus, SAdV-3 ( Fig. 4 ; Table  2 ). Furthermore, serological evidence for cross-species adenoviral transmission events between different nonhuman primate species has been previously reported in the literature [42] . Although we failed to detect TMAdV in rodent droppings found near titi monkey cages (Table 2) , it is still possible that the virus arose from an unknown animal reservoir. In this regard, the high sequence divergence of TMAdV relative to the known human/simian adenoviruses (Fig. 3) , and comparable sequence similarity in the polymerase gene to a porcine adenovirus (Figs. 3 and S1) are striking. The four-week interval between the index case and the second case appears overly long given a typical incubation period for adenovirus infections of no more than 1 week [43] . This may be explained by our finding of a high rate of subclinical infection by TMAdV in asymptomatic titi monkeys (35%), but may also be due to separate introductions of TMAdV into the colony from an as-yet unidentified reservoir.",

The researcher's fever, cough, and pleuritic symptoms (''burning sensation in the lungs'') are consistent with the development of a prolonged viral respiratory illness. Interestingly, pleurisy has been specifically reported in association with certain human adenovirus infections [44] . The clinical presentation, time of illness concurrent with the onset of the outbreak, and presence of neutralizing Abs in convalescent serum all strongly point to primary infection of the researcher by TMAdV. The detection of weakly neutralizing Abs (1:8) in a serum sample from a sick family member of the researcher also suggests that TMAdV may be capable of humanto-human transmission. The decreased levels of neutralizing Abs to TMAdV in the researcher (1:32) and a family member (1:8) relative to those in infected titi monkeys (up to .1:512) are consistent with a recent study showing much higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in chimpanzees than in humans with adenovirus infections, possibly due to more robust adenovirusspecific T-cell responses in humans than in monkeys [45] .",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence support the contention that the direction of TMAdV transmission was zoonotic (monkeys to humans) rather than anthroponotic (humans to monkeys). First, the closest known relative to TMAdV in GenBank is SAdV-3, an Old World monkey adenovirus ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ). Second, our results show that PCR assays for human adenoviruses in common use are capable of detecting TMAdV. Although sequencing of PCR amplicons for human adenoviruses is not performed routinely in diagnostic virology, TMAdV would presumably have been detected previously in large-scale studies of hexon sequencing of Ad field isolates if it were circulating in the community [46, 47] . Finally, the available sequence data in GenBank is heavily biased towards human adenoviruses, and much less is known about the potential diversity of the simian adenoviruses. We also cannot formally exclude the possibility that the outbreak arose from anthroponotic transmission. In our study, 2 of 81, or 2.5% of random adult blood donors exhibited borderline titers of neutralizing antibody to TMAdV, indicating either a low prevalence of TMAdV in the human population or cross-reactivity to a related virus (although no evidence of cross-reactivity was found with HAdV serotypes 1 through 35). Future large-scale studies of TMAdV seroepidemiology will be needed to better understand transmission of TMAdV between monkeys and humans. Nevertheless, our discovery of TMAdV, a novel adenovirus with the capacity to cross species barriers, highlights the need to monitor adenoviruses closely for outbreak or even pandemic potential.",
