Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was suspected by the presence of blister cells on peripheral smear and was confirmed by a low enzyme activity assay. Our patient reported playing football, along with upper respiratory infection symptoms, prior to presentation. Extensive infectious and toxicology workup was negative; however, several inflammatory proteins were markedly elevated. We hypothesized the large inflammatory burden led to an increased reactive oxygen radical burden that overwhelmed muscle and erythrocyte reducing power. Severe rhabdomyolysis in G6PD deficiency is not a common presentation because skeletal muscles are more resistant to oxidative damage compared to red blood cells. Our case adds to the few existing reports of myolysis in the setting of G6PD deficiency.",

The precipitant of his rhabdomyolysis remained unclear at the time of discharge, given the negative infectious and toxicology workup. Nevertheless, his very high serum ferritin, CRP, and low albumin were reflective of a very inflamed internal milieu, which generated significantly large quantities of oxidative radicals that overwhelmed muscle and erythrocyte protective reducing power. He reported playing football with friends, along with a viral prodrome, a few days prior to his presentation so physical exertion, in addition to an unidentified oxidative stressor(s), potentially triggered his symptomatology. Other potential causes of rhabdomyolysis, such as inflammatory myopathies, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and seizures, were unlikely in our patient on the basis of clinical and laboratory data. Metabolic myopathies due to inborn errors of glycogen or lipid metabolism can rarely present as rhabdomyolysis but more commonly manifest as episodes of exercise-induced muscle pain and/or exercise intolerance which was not present in our patient.",

It is plausible the metabolic acidosis induced by acute renal failure, acting in combination with an underlying oxidative trigger, precipitated his acute hemolysis. It is important to note G6PD levels can be falsely normal during an acute hemolytic episode because reticulocytes have higher G6PD activity than mature red blood cells, which necessitates repeat testing after the resolution of hemolysis if there is high clinical suspicion of G6PD deficiency. Interestingly, our patient had low levels of G6PD during the hemolytic crisis which remained low after resolution of hemolysis, strongly suggesting a true G6PD deficiency. The etiology of his absolute lymphopenia remained unclear but was likely related to the undiagnosed underlying infectious/inflammatory trigger; conversely, the mild thrombocytopenia seen on presentation was likely a false positive result, given that platelets were normal on follow-up peripheral smear. Rhabdomyolysis can be expected to cause elevation of ALT and AST; however, the presence of significant conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in our patient was suggestive of some component of acute hepatocellular injury of unclear etiology contributing to his liver enzyme elevation.",

            "text": "G6PD levels in skeletal muscle cells have been shown to correlate with enzyme activity in erythrocytes [3] . However, skeletal muscles are much more resistant to oxidative damage than RBCs of G6PD-deficient persons because muscle cells possess alternate enzymes, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase, which are absent in erythrocytes. Nevertheless, skeletal muscles have lower levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase compared to other tissues and have some dependency on glutathione to remove reactive oxidative radicals [3] . In a mouse model, muscle glutathione needed to be severely depleted to induce skeletal muscle breakdown [4] . This finding suggests that the burden of oxidative stress needs to be very large in order to overwhelm glutathione and alternative pathways and cause muscle damage. This probably explains the rarity of severe muscle manifestations in G6PD-deficient patients and why there were no significant differences in two studies that compared blood and muscle oxidative stress markers between G6PD-deficient and normal individuals after they had been subjected to moderate [5] or severe [6] physical exertion.",

The same authors also published three other cases of males who were diagnosed with a G6PD deficiency during evaluation of recurrent unexplained myalgias, muscle fatiguability, or exercise-induced myoglobinuria [7] . Two other cases of myolysis and hemolysis in African-American (AA) male patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) and G6PD deficiency were also reported. One was a 34-year-old Black male diagnosed with sickle cell trait and G6PD deficiency after presenting with rhabdomyolysis and acute hemolytic anemia 24 hours after vigorous exercise [8] . The other case was a two-year-old AA male with SCT diagnosed with a G6PD deficiency after he developed rhabdomyolysis and acute hemolysis on exposure to a mothball [9] . In these two cases, G6PD deficiency in concert with SCT likely precipitated rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis. G6PD deficiency can occur simultaneously with SCT in up to 5% of men of African descent [10] and thus should be investigated when male patients of African or African-American descent with SCT present with unexplained severe rhabdomyolysis and/or hemolysis.",
