            "text": "Antibodies against spike proteins of influenza are used as a tool for characterization of viruses and therapeutic approaches. However, development, production and quality control of antibodies is expensive and time consuming. To circumvent these difficulties, three peptides were derived from complementarity determining regions of an antibody heavy chain against influenza A spike glycoprotein. Their binding properties were studied experimentally, and by molecular dynamics simulations. Two peptide candidates showed binding to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2. One of them, termed PeB, with the highest affinity prevented binding to and infection of target cells in the micromolar region without any cytotoxic effect. PeB matches best the conserved receptor binding site of hemagglutinin. PeB bound also to other medical relevant influenza strains, such as human-pathogenic A/California/7/2009 H1N1, and avian-pathogenic A/Mute Swan/Rostock/R901/2006 H7N1. Strategies to improve the affinity and to adapt specificity are discussed and exemplified by a double amino acid substituted peptide, obtained by substitutional analysis. The peptides and their derivatives are of great potential for drug development as well as biosensing.",

The envelope bilayer harbors the two spike glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and the M2 proton channel. The homotrimeric HA is the most abundant protein on the viral surface. It mediates attachment to the host cell surface via binding to sialic acid (SA) residues of cellular receptors, and upon endocytic virus uptake it triggers fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. NA cleaves glycosidic bonds with terminal SA facilitating the release of budding virions from the cell.",

Some of them showed antiviral activity [17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . A more epitope-oriented accession to binding peptides is the search for paratope-derived peptides from variable regions of specific antibodies [24] . Antibodies against HA have been described, and at least 6 antigenic sites (A-F) on the HA-trimer have been identified, localized either at the receptor binding site, the interface of the three HA-monomers, or at other sites like the stalk [8, 11, 25] . Several structures of HA-antibody complexes have been published deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) [11] [12] [13] [14] . Indeed, an antibody was described, whose HA binding is mediated mainly by one CDR, namely HCDR3 [12] .",

In the SPR based screen for virus binding, single and double mutated variants of PeB-Lys were used. All lysine variants were purchased from Biosyntan or Genecust with >95% purity.

Briefly, each complex configuration was first optimized by 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by another 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, keeping all atoms of the complex restrained to their initial position with a weak harmonic potential. Each system was then simulated for 50 ps at constant volume with a 2 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 -2 restraint on the complex, in order to equilibrate the solvent at 300 K without undesirable drifts of the structure. Subsequently, a 50 ps MD simulation with a 2 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 -2 restraint on each complex at a pressure of 101,325 kPa was conducted to relax the density using Berendsen's barostat. After 1 ns without restraint equilibration phase, a 10 ns simulation at constant pressure was carried out and the coordinates were stored every 10 ps, resulting in 1000 configurations for each simulation. Subsequently, Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed.",

Molecular configurations obtained from MD simulations of the complexes in explicit water were used for calculation of binding free energies using an implicit solvation scheme. The binding free energy was decomposed into contributions of the individual peptide residues (Fig 2B, PeB) . Residues within and close to the loop (Y5 to Y12) provide the largest contributions to the binding free energy. Significant attractive contributions to the binding free energy change arise from F4 (-0.6 kcal mol -1 ), Y7 (-3.9 kcal mol -1 ), and F10 (-3.0 kcal mol -1 ). However, D8 and D6 contribute repulsively by 2.4 kcal mol -1 and 3.7 kcal mol -1 , respectively, to the binding free energy. Hence, exchanging D8 and D6 to other amino acids would predict to reduce the repulsive interactions of these residues and, thus, to increase the affinity of the modified PeB to HA. The detailed analysis of electrostatic, van der Waals and polar contributions to the free energy change of each residue is presented in S3 Fig. We have also analyzed the contributions of the individual residues of HA to this complex. Attractive contributions mainly originate from residues S136 (-3.0 kcal mol -1 ), N137 (-1.8 kcal mol -1 ), and L194 (-1.0 kcal mol -1 ), whereas the most significant repulsive contribution is caused by E190 (1.1 kcal mol -1 ) (numbering according to PDB 2vir) (S4 Fig). The attractive contributions from the polar residues S136 and N137 arise mainly from the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energy, whereas the hydrophobic residue L194 derives most of its contribution from van der Waals interactions.",

For this purpose, peptides PeA-Lys, PeB-Lys, and PeC-Lys, containing lysine residues at the amino terminus, acting as spacer were used. As deduced from MD simulations, the N-terminus of PeB does not significantly contribute to binding of the peptide to HA, as the contribution of these residues to the total free energy change is close to 0 kcal mol -1 (Fig 2B, PeB) . Binding Significant virus binding was observed on PeB-and PeC-, but not on PeA-modified surfaces consistent with our MD simulations. The minimum detection level, corresponding to the lowest virus concentration, and showing binding 3 times above the SPR response of a buffer control, was 0.19 \u03bcg and 6.25 \u03bcg Aichi H3N2 virus protein ml -1 for immobilized PeB and PeC, respectively. The higher sensitivity of PeB in the viral binding assay confirms the selection of this CDR derived peptide for further experiments, as mentioned above. To confirm specificity three PeB variants containing single amino acid residue exchanges, which were immobilized with the same ligand density, were investigated. No binding was observed with the three variants, suggesting that the binding of virus is indeed specific to the CDR sequence ( Fig 4A) . The results also exclude the possibility that binding is mediated by the oligolysine terminus. Furthermore, several well-known proteins were tested for unspecific binding to the peptide modified chip surface ( Fig 4B) . All proteins were injected at the same mass concentration. Only for core-streptavidin and lysozyme minor binding to PeB was found showing that surface inertness is not impaired.",

The IC 50 values are in the range of 75-120 \u03bcM, depending on the assay, which is about one order of magnitude lower than the IC 50 of \u03b1-2,6-sialyllactose.",

Nevertheless, PeB and its derivatives harboring only those amino acids which are essential for the recognition of SA are presumably not efficient binders in their monomeric form. The affinities of the peptides are in the micromolar range, whereas the reported K D value of antibody HC19 binding to hemagglutinin from Aichi H3N2 is 28 \u00b1 8 nM [47] . However, weak binding interactions for such shorter monomeric peptides could be enhanced by a multivalent interaction as it occurs very likely in the SPR based experiments, where binding of even 6.5\u00c110 8 viruses ml -1 to immobilized PeB could be detected (Fig 3) . Extensions of the C-and N-termini of the CDR sequences could be important for (i) the formation of a stable peptide structure, which exposes the CDR loop region in its native arrangement or (ii) direct involvement in binding and foster interaction with HA.",

The mutation of residue 6 (D6G), replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, resulted in two major changes. Firstly, it induces a decrease of its own electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy, but such a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the polar solvation free energy change (S3 Fig). On the other hand, one should notice that residues 6 and 8 are located in close contact to each other in the loop region. As a consequence for PeB, this involves repulsive interaction between two negatively charged residues (D6 and D8). The replacement of D6 by an uncharged residue in PeB GF probably induces a slight reorganization in the loop structure, favoring van der Waals and polar solvation interaction contributions between this residue and the HA moieties (S3 Fig).

However, we should take into consideration that the performance of a peptide as inhibitor depends on many factors. As a consequence, the hemagglutination inhibition efficiency may not necessarily be stronger against Aichi H3N2, even though the peptide was derived from an antibody binding to this influenza strain. One can speculate that Rostock H7N1 is more prone to neutralization by blocking this binding site, while for Aichi H3N2 PeB and PeB GF can be displaced more easily in a binding competition experiment with erythrocytes. This trend could also be explained by the use of erythrocytes derived from different species (see Material and Methods). Similar strain-dependent efficiencies have been obtained by L\u00f3pez-Martinez et al. [22] .

For example, sialyl-containing oligosaccharides constituting the natural receptors of hemagglutinin on mammalian epithelial cells, exhibit a millimolar 1:1 affinity, but due to multivalent virus-cell attachment the binding is strong enough to enable infection. Effective inhibition of influenza virus infection by multivalent sialic-acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles and other glycoarchitectures has been described [57, 58] .

In a coevolutionary approach the peptide's primary sequence may also be adapted to seasonal upcoming mutations of the influenza virus with minor additional efforts, costs and in short time without the additional development of novel monoclonal antibodies. Contributions of individual residues of PeB (black) and PeB GF (grey) to the binding free energies of the corresponding PeB-HA or PeB GF -HA complexes. A) Electrostatic, B) van der Waals and C) polar contributions to the total binding free energy change. The mutation of residue 6 (D6G) replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, decreases the electrostatic contribution, but such a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the solvation free energy change, as calculated. Mutation of amino acid 11 (Y11F) appears not to alter directly the contribution of the interaction between this residue and the HA, but it induces a favorable free energy change contribution in the interaction between residue 10 and the HA, essentially by a more favorable van der Waals interaction energy change between uncharged residues. (TIF) Labeled influenza California H1N1 (left), New York H3N2 (middle) and Victoria H3N2 (right) were used as analytes. Numbers represent mean value of the contrast relative to contrast for positive control fetuin. False-colors are used to illuminate fluorescence intensities, color changes from blue (lower) to yellow (higher intensity than PeB). Data just represent qualitative relation between PeB mutants within single influenza strains. Quantitative comparison between different strains is not valid due to the varying types of samples, while precise quantitation fails due to unknown ligand density (most likely varying per peptide). Table. Alignment of HA sequences of used influenza viruses. Amino acids involved in binding of PeB as obtained from MD-simulations are highlighted in gray. PDB2vir: sequence obtained from protein database; A/mute/swan/R901/06-H7N1: sequence obtained from Prof. Harder (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Riems, Germany); all other sequences were obtained from influenza virus resource (IVR) as indicated by their accession numbers [62] . While L219 is identical for all subtypes, S159 and E215 are replaced in some cases by functional closely related T or D, respectively. The sequence differ mostly in N160, which is replaced by S, A or V. The N160 substitutions could be the main reason for differences in the observed binding ability. (DOCX)",
