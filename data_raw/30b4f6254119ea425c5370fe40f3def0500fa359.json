Our ensembles to explain centrality were optimised to reduce RMSE. The greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective metric is optimised (minimising RMSE). The greedy algorithm has only one shot to compute the optimal solution (i.e., it never goes back and reverses any decision). The exact weights chosen varied with each fold of each training dataset.
