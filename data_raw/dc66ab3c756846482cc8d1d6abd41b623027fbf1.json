Despite being ultimately controlled, Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and other single-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses in the Filoviridae family, continue to pose a high risk for causing epidemics with high mortality rates [1] . In addition to the mortality associated with acute infections and disease, sequelae of EBOV infections include neurological and ocular complications, joint and muscle pain, and virus persistence for many months [2, 3] . This persistence is particularly concerning from the public health perspective given that most of the population is still immune naive. Currently, there are no approved therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent infections by EBOV or other filoviruses, necessitating development of clinical-grade therapeutics.",

Glycoprotein is produced from an alternative transcript of the GP gene, with soluble GP (sGP) being the main product [4] . Glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein that is posttranslationally cleaved by furin into 2 disulphide-linked subunits (GP1 and GP2) that form a trimer of heterodimers on the surface of the virion and infected cells [5, 6] . Once host cell-bound virions are internalized into endosomes, the viruses are exposed to low pH, and further proteolytic cleavage of GP reveals GP1 surfaces that bind the endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which is required for penetration of the nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm [7] and initiation of replication. The sGPs can be readily detected in the sera of infected animals, and patients and plays a role in pathogenesis [8] .",

In addition, GP-specific antibodies isolated from survivors of EBOV infection or immunized animals have been shown to effectively treat EBOV disease in infected NHPs [12] [13] [14] .

To date, EBOV antibody therapies have been developed either by humanization of rodent-generated antibodies or by isolation of antibody genes from infected patients. Each method has significant drawbacks: antibody therapeutics have also faced supply constraints due to challenges with production methods [16] , requirements for sequence reverse engineering [17] , and/ or lack of manufacturing-ready cell lines, thereby preventing large-scale production and controlled testing for treatment of EBOV disease. In this study, we describe the use of a platform to generate, select, test, and manufacture a panel of fully human, noncross-competing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to treat EBOV disease. Mice encoding fully human antibody variable region gene segments (VelocImmune mice) [18, 19] were immunized, and 3 EBOV GP-binding antibodies with complementary biological properties were identified. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) isogenic cell banks expressing each of these mAbs individually were made, and mAbs were immediately manufactured. When used as a cocktail, the 3 mAbs reversed severe disease symptoms and greatly promoted survival of rhesus macaques when administered at 5 days post-EBOV challenge, late in the disease course in this animal model. In this study, we describe the biological properties of the antibodies, where they bind to GP, and the outcomes of testing in the NHP model of disease.",

Plates were transferred to a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory to complete the infection assay. The EBOV strains (Mayinga, Kikwit, Makona, and guinea pig-adapted Mayinga) were thawed and diluted. An equivalent volume of infectious EBOV was added to wells (multiplicity of infection between 0.01 and 0.1), and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. After the incubation period, plates were removed from incubator and inactivated by immersing in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, placed in a heat-sealed bag, and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight in the BSL-4 laboratory. Plates were washed 3 times in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were permeabilized at RT with 25 \u00b5L 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1\u00d7 PBS for 15-20 minutes.

To obtain these, VelocImmune mice were immunized with DNA constructs encoding the GP protein and/or recombinant purified GP protein (Makona strain). To select the best therapeutic antibodies from the pool of GP-specific antibodies obtained from these immunized mice, several in vitro screening assays were used to identify antibodies that collectively provide the following properties: (1) blocking entry of EBOV GP-pseudotyped particles into susceptible cells, (2) ability to remain bound to GP at endosomal pH to prevent interaction with intracellular receptors and membrane fusion [33] , (3) lack of cross-competition to ensure that antibodies simultaneously bind to GP, (4) binding to sGP to block its potential role in EBOV pathogenesis, and (5) Fc effector function to mediate killing of EBOV-infected cells by immune cells, which was previously suggested as important for protection [16] . To facilitate discovery of antibodies that mediated this latter activity, our screening was undertaken with antibodies produced in a CHO cell line that had been selected for its ability to produce antibodies with very low levels of terminal fucosylation (data not shown), because low fucosylation has been reported to enhance antibody effector function [34] and contribute to anti-EBOV activity [35] .

First, cross-competition between paired mAbs was assessed by using the Octet HTX system. After the capture of EBOV GP protein onto Octet sensors, the first test antibody was allowed to bind to saturation, followed by exposure to the second test antibody. All possible paired combinations of EBOV-specific mAbs and an isotype control were tested (Table 4 ). This assay format showed that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 do not compete for binding to EBOV GP. To substantiate whether these antibodies are able to bind the EBOV GP simultaneously, a 3-step sequential-binding study was performed using SPR. Saturating amounts of each mAb were applied in separate, sequential steps over an EBOV GP sensor chip surface, using all permutations for the order of antibody addition. Figure 1A shows a sensorgram displaying sequential increases in binding signal resulting from injection of EBOV GP to the sensor chip, followed by the injection of REGN3479, REGN3471, and REGN3470. Control experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of the same antibody did not result in additional binding signal, indicating that the binding sites for each antibody were saturated by the first injection (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for all permutations in the order of antibody injections ( Figure 1B) , demonstrating that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 can bind simultaneously to EBOV GP.",

Consistent with the SPR findings, comparison of these reconstructions indicates that each antibody binds to a different site on the GP molecule. Antibody REGN3471 ( Figure 1C , purple) has the steepest angle of approach on GP, binding nearly perpendicular to the viral surface. The antibody binds within the chalice structure at or near the head of GP and may partially contact the glycan cap. This placement allows the GP trimer to accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs, despite the very tight clustering of the epitope. REGN3470 (Figure 1C , green) binds parallel to the viral surface on the outside of the glycan cap. Finally, REGN3479 ( Figure 1C , orange) binds at the base of GP, between protomers of GP1/GP2.",

            "text": "The ability of REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 to neutralize lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Makona strain EBOV GP is shown in Figure 2A . REGN3470 and REGN3479 neutralized pseudovirus particles with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of 0.27 and 0.17 nM, respectively, although neutralization with REGN3470 never exceeded 90%. In contrast, REGN3471 displayed weak neutralization (<50%) and only at high antibody concentrations. As a cocktail, the 3 antibodies demonstrated potent neutralization with an IC 50 of 0.39 nM. None of the antibodies blocked the entry of VSV-Gpseudotyped control particles, indicating that their activity is specific for EBOV GP (Figure 2A) . In addition, we tested the antibodies in a live virus PRNT assay using Makona, Mayinga, guinea pig-adapted Mayinga, and Kikwit EBOV strains (Table 5 ). REGN3479 was a potent neutralizer of virus infectivity across all strains tested (PRNT-50 value = 0.1-0.2 nM for all strains), whereas REGN3470 and REGN3471 did not display significant neutralization in this assay. The difference in neutralizing potency is consistent with other published data showing that pseudotyped viruses are more easily neutralized than wild-type viruses and probably reflects the lesser amount of GP present on pseudovirions [36] . Effector functions of antibodies are recognized as important in clearance of many virus types by cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Its importance in clearance of EBOV disease is presently unclear, but previous reports indicated that ADCC is elicited by an antibody isolated from a human survivor [13] , and studies have suggested that reduced fucose forms of nonneutralizing mAbs are more efficacious in animal models of EBOV infection than the same mAbs with normal levels of fucose [16] . To determine whether the in vitro properties of each antibody translated into in vivo activity, they were evaluated for their postexposure therapeutic efficacy against a lethal EBOV challenge in the guinea pig model of infection. Guinea pigs were chosen because they have been used to predict therapeutic benefit for antibody-cocktails eventually tested in NHPs [12] . Groups of 6 animals (approximately 400 grams each) were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pigadapted EBOV, followed 24 hours later by a single 5-mg dose of antibody or placebo control. Guinea pigs were monitored twice daily for 21 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each cohort and the clinical scores of each animal in each treatment group are shown in Figure 2C . All of the guinea pigs in the placebo group succumbed to EBOV disease by day 7. In contrast, postchallenge administration of each antibody was shown to delay EBOV disease symptom onset and prevent or delay death during the observation period. REGN3479, the most potent neutralizer in vitro, displayed the greatest individual efficacy, with 66% of treated animals surviving. REGN3471 protected approximately 33% of infected animals, whereas, REGN3470 improved median survival by 4 days, but all animals eventually succumbed to disease. The clinical scores indicated delayed onset of disease signs for all mAb-treated animals compared with placebo treatment. In addition, surviving animals in the REGN3471-and REGN3479-treated groups displayed limited clinical signs of infection. This study shows that in this disease model antibodies that only block infection by neutralization (REGN3479), only have effector functions via signaling through Fc\u03b3RIIIa (REGN3471), or combine both activities (REGN3470) show benefit in vivo when administered as a monotherapy. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that each of the 3 mAbs selected has a different binding and functional activity profile that confers protection from disease and lethality in an in vivo model of EBOV disease.",

The first study showed that 3 postinfection doses of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail administered 1:1:1 (50 mg/kg total antibody) resulted in 100% protection from lethal disease. Rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the Kikwit strain of EBOV by intramuscular injection and were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (control arm) contained 6 animals that were each administered an intravenous placebo control. Group 2 (treatment arm) contained 9 animals that were administered the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail intravenously at 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection. Animals were monitored daily for signs of EBOV disease. As shown in Figure 3A , all 6 placebo-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 9 postinfection. In contrast, despite showing disease symptoms on day 5, when treatment began, none of the 9 animals that received the antibody cocktail succumbed to disease. Clinical scores ( Figure 3B ) indicated that disease symptoms in the treated animals were also abrogated and that all treated animals showed no obvious signs of disease before the third dose of the cocktail was administered on day 11. Analysis of serum viral load by plaque assay ( Figure 3C ) indicated that all treated animals had undetectable circulating replication-competent virus after the first dose of the cocktail. Body temperatures recorded by telemetry (Supplemental Figure 1 ) indicated that all animals in the placebo group had sustained fever (Supplemental Figure 1A -F, red and purple dots) that persisted until succumbing to disease. Likewise, the antibody cocktail-treated animals exhibited fever beginning on day 3-4 postinfection. However, in contrast to the placebo group, the fever had ended, for most animals, by day 9, providing an additional clinical measure indicating that animals were recovering 4 days after initiation of treatment, before the third dose of the cocktail was administered.",

            "text": "To evaluate whether single-dose or 2-dose regimens were similarly protective, a second independent postexposure treatment study was performed at a different BSL-4 facility. Eighteen rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the Kikwit strain of EBOV and divided into 4 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 3 doses of 50 mg/kg of the antibody mixture (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection (4 animals), 2 doses of 50 mg/kg of the antibody mixture on days 5 and 8 postinfection (5 animals), or 1 dose of 150 mg/ kg of the antibody mixture on day 5 postvirus challenge. Animals were monitored daily for mortality and clinical symptoms ( Figure 4A and B) . As in the previous study, all placebo control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 9. In contrast, treatment resulted in survival of most animals in each treatment group, despite the finding that all animals showed multiple clinical signs of disease before treatment initiation ( Figure 4B ). Only 1 animal succumbed to the infection in the 3 \u00d7 50 mg/kg and 1 \u00d7 150 mg/kg groups, and all animals survived in the 2 \u00d7 50 mg/kg group. There were no significant differences between the treatment arms, indicating that fewer doses (and less total administered antibody) or a single administration of the antibody cocktail provide a similar therapeutic result to what was previously observed with 3 \u00d7 50 mg/kg doses of cocktail. Similar to what was observed in the first study, combined clinical scores of placebo and antibody-treated animals ( Figure 4B ) indicated that all animals had advanced disease that was controlled by the treatment, and the majority of these infected animals displayed no symptoms after approximately day 10 postinfection. Finally, virus load was measured in the sera of infected control and treated animals by 2 different assays: a plaque assay to detect infectious virus ( Figure 4C ) and quantitative PCR to detect the presence of virus genomes ( Figure 4D) . These viral load studies confirmed that antibody treatment (but not placebo treatment) controlled EBOV infection, reducing virus loads by >10 6 -fold, and showed that the 2 animals that succumbed to EBOV disease in the treated groups displayed viral genome copy numbers higher than the other members of their treated cohorts. In addition, these data show similar levels of virus load control in all treated animals regardless of treatment regimen. A third study was designed to test a single treatment dose (for clinical ease of use in an outbreak setting) and evaluate the minimal efficacious dose of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail. Forty rhesus macaques were challenged and divided into 5 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 150 mg/ kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), and 10 mg/kg (9 animals) of the antibody cocktail (1:1:1) on day 5 postinfection. As shown in Figure 5A , all 4 placebo control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease. As seen in the second study, despite clear disease signs being present, administration of 150 mg/kg antibody cocktail resulted in almost complete survival of infected animals (8 of 9 animals). In addition, a single treatment of 100 mg/kg resulted in a similar high survival (8 of 9 animals), and a single treatment of the 50 mg/ kg led to survival of 7 of 9 animals (nonsignificant difference compared with higher-dose groups), whereas 10 mg/kg had a partial effect, because 5 of 9 succumbed to the infection despite treatment. Duration of fever ( Figure 5B ) and the extent of temperature increase ( Figure 5C ) were identical for the 150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg groups, indicating that these 2 doses of the cocktail had similar effect on controlling fever. In comparison, animals that received the 50 mg/kg dose were slightly impaired at controlling their fever, whereas the 10 mg/kg group displayed temperature readings similar to the placebo-treated group, even though a significant number of animals survived in this cohort. Thus, a single-dose treatment with the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail afforded high-level, dose-dependent, postexposure protection against lethal EBOV disease and that 100 mg/kg was the lowest dose tested that gave best control of symptoms.",

            "text": "The catastrophic outbreak of EBOV in West Africa in 2013-2016 and the current outbreak in Congo have emphasized the need to develop rapid, systematic approaches for development of therapeutics for treatment of disease. Multiple classes of EBOV disease therapeutics, ranging from small molecule inhibitors that act on viral replication to mAbs that recognize viral proteins, have been described [38] . Human mAbs are particularly appealing because they display predictable pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and their antipathogen activities can be rapidly evaluated in vitro based on established mechanisms of action. Fully human mAbs with potent antiviral activity can be generated rapidly and reliably using a platform based on humanized mice as demonstrated in the present report and previously for development of mAbs to treat infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [22] . In the work described here, we developed a cocktail of antibodies to (1) combine biological activities and improve efficacy/ outcomes, (2) reduce potential for escape and resistance, and (3) increase the potential utility for future outbreaks as virus sequences evolve. To this end, we selected candidate mAbs based on in vitro antibody properties suggested as predictive of in vivo efficacy in previous studies. Both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies have previously been suggested to be efficacious in guinea pig and NHP models, so assays were established to measure neutralization of EBOV pseudotypes, as well as assays to evaluate ability to trigger Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling, and binding to sGP (which likely plays a role in EBOV pathogenesis).",

The 3 antibodies were purposely chosen to bind distinct epitopes in the GP to hinder development of viral resistance. After the rapid screening and selection of these mAbs, the guinea pig model was used to validate them. An antibody with Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling but no neutralizing activity (REGN3471), a novel single mAb that displayed both neutralizing and Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling activity (REGN3470), or a mAb with high levels of neutralizing activity (REGN3479) can delay or prevent death in this model. In this case, the strongly neutralizing antibody appeared more protective than the other 2 antibodies. However, the human Fc may not properly trigger guinea pig Fc\u03b3 receptors, so it is hard to interpret the contribution of effector activity in this model.",

These studies revealed that REGN3471 has the steepest angle of approach on EBOV GP, binding perpendicular to the viral surface at an angle of approximately 90 degrees. The EBOV GP trimer was able to accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs, despite the tight clustering of the epitope within the chalice structure of the trimer at or near the head of GP, in an area that likely overlaps with the glycan cap. REGN3471 appears to bind even closer to the center of the chalice than does mAb c13C6 (that forms part of the ZMapp cocktail) [31] . Compared with mAb114, a neutralizing human mAb obtained from a longterm human survivor of EBOV disease [39] , REGN3471 binds further away from the NPC1 Loop C binding site, which may explain why this antibody is not neutralizing [39] . REGN3470 binds the EBOV GP parallel to the viral surface on the outside of the glycan cap, a position that could help to explain neutralization and its ability to trigger Fc\u03b3RIIIa. Finally, REGN3479 binds at the base of GP, between protomers of GP1/GP2. The epitope lies near the internal fusion loop and cathepsin cleavage site, similar to the neutralizing antibodies derived from a longterm survivor, which were recently crystalized [39] . The angle of REGN3479 is rotated 90 degrees compared with mAb100, and the angle of approach is slightly upward from the viral surface. Based on its binding site, the potent neutralization activity of REGN3479 may be due to blockade of cathepsin cleavage or release of the fusion loop upon receptor binding, similar to the mechanism proposed for mAb100 [39] .",

In the presence of EBOV GP-expressing cells, REGN3470 and REGN3471 induced a dose-dependent activation of Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling in effector cells with half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 2.9 and 1.6 nM, respectively. The REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail (1:1:1 equimolar ratio) also induced Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling with an EC 50 of 1.7 nM. No activation was observed in the presence of control cells. These results indicate that binding of REGN3470 and REGN3471 to EBOV GP-expressing target cells induced avidity-driven Fc binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa on effector cells, resulting in activation of signaling. REGN3479 had no activity, indicating that this antibody, although strongly neutralizing, does not activate Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat cells, even though it bound to the target cell surface (results not shown).",

The Mayinga strain of EBOV was obtained from Dr. Heinrich Feldmann (Laboratory of Virology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], National Institutes of Health, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT). The EBOV kikwit-9510621 was used for animal challenges at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. A second cell-culture passage (P2) of EBOV kikwit-9510621 was obtained from Dr. Tom Ksiazek (at NIAID's World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at University of Texas Medical Branch's Health Galveston National Laboratory) in 2012 and propagated at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. The stock virus was passaged for a third time in Vero E6 cells and had a titer of 2.1 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL. The challenge stock has been confirmed to be wild-type EBOV by deep sequencing and was attributed the lot no. 201209171. Sequencing showed that the abundance of the genomes possess 7U at the editing site locus is 94.3%",
