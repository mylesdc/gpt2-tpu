The relative and absolute number of central memory and na\u00efve CD3 + CD8 + in patients with biological prosthesis was decreased ( < 0.001). Meanwhile the number of CD45RA + CD62L \u2212 CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD4 + was increased ( < 0.001). Patients with mechanical prosthesis had increased absolute and relative number of CD45RA + CD62L \u2212 CD3 + CD8 + cells ( = 0.006). Also the relative number of CD3 + CD4 + cells was reduced ( = 0.04). We assume that altered composition of T cell subsets points at development of xenograft rejection reaction against both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses.",

Character and intensity of such reactions are subject to thorough investigation in order to, on one hand, select proper prosthetic heart valve and, on the other hand, develop approaches for improving prostheses and preventing complications and their dysfunctions. Previously, it was found that biological compared to mechanical prostheses may cause inflammatory complications [1] .

It is assumed that inadequately fixed tissues of porcine aorta resulting in subsequently retained antigenicity might be one of potential causes of developing inflammation [6] .

Currently, it is known that na\u00efve T cells express CD45 molecules containing all domains within its sequence; however, starting from antigenspecific differentiation maturing T cells begin to express their isoforms resulting from mRNA splicing within exon A followed by exons B and C. Gene product containing all these domains is known as CD45RA (molecular weight 220 kDa), whereas the product derived after final RNA modification and lacking all such domains is denoted as CD45R0 (180 kDa).

The latter subset bears adhesion molecules responsible for cell migration into body peripheral tissues.

Presence of CD62L on the surface of these cells allows to distinguish them from effector memory T cells with phenotype CD45RA \u2212 CD62L \u2212 . This feature of Tcm allows them to circulate around the body for a long period of time and determines their preferential location inside the secondary lymphoid tissues. Upon antigenic stimulation, antigen presenting cells possessing cognate surface ligands allow to rapidly activate T cells with high expression level of CD27 and CD28 followed by successful formation of antigen-specific T cell clones [13] .

At that, despite the fact that no significant differences between all examined parameters of T cell immunity were found in recipients of different types of prostheses, some of them, however, significantly differed when compared to healthy volunteers. We assume that altered composition of T cell subsets, namely, decreased counts of CM Tcyt, na\u00efve Tcyt paralleled with elevated amount of Emra Tcyt, and Emra Th, points at development of xenograft rejection reaction against both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses. Importantly, a more pronounced rejection reaction was against biological prostheses. It seems that despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues, quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains (swine valve apparatus). T cells and monocytes become stimulated by foreign antigens that also provoke their migration into donor tissues and in situ activation resulting in release of huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. In particular, a whole set of such biologically active molecules may display proosteogenic activity not only supporting local inflammatory reaction, but also leading to collagen degradation and deposition of hydroxyapatites. Altogether, local inflammatory and degenerative changes within prosthetic tissues may result in prosthesis dysfunction [19] .",

Moreover a significant proportion of TEMRA cells remained depleted for \u22653 months in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients. Hereby myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in cytomegalovirusseropositive patients lead to acute loss of antigen-specific, terminally differentiated CD8 T cells [20] .

Nevertheless while studying 55 patients with type 1 diabetes it was found that percentages and absolute numbers of CM and N cells were reduced, whereas those of TEMRA cells were markedly increased. The indices of intermediate-and longterm glycaemic control were associated negatively with the number of CM and N cells while positively with the number of TEMRA cells.
