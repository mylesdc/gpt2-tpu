We used open-source automated software that couples a clinical NLP pipeline (Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) [11] ) with an implementation of a conditional random fields probabilistic classifier [12] to develop the text analyses that could separate non-negative from negative chest imaging reports (Automated Retrieval Console (ARC) software, v.2.0 [13, 14] ). In a preliminary effort to improve the performance of the classifier, the reference imaging reports were presented for machine-learning as four alternative training sets where: a) the text of the reports was fed either whole or scrubbed from the characters preceding the string ''Impression'' when the latter was found; b) targeted reports were either all of the non-negative reports (n = 450) or only those that described abnormalities typical for a pneumonia (n = 316). Text classification models with the highest F-measure were retained for each training set. The four retained models were then separately combined with other EMR-derived data and performance of the resulting CDAs at identifying patients that fitted our case definition compared (see next paragraph). The text classification models trained with reports that contained typical pneumonia descriptions and whose text was restricted to the ''Impression'' field led to the best performing pneumonia CDAs, and were those used for this report. Candidate components for CDAs included those previously found useful to identify patients with ARI: ARI-related ICD-9 codes (labeled as ''ARI ICD-9 codes''), cough remedies [10] , and clinical notes identified as positive for ARI symptoms by text analysis [10] (''Text of Clinical Notes''). We also considered the following CDA components, when related to the index outpatient visit: 1) a subset of the ARI ICD-9 codes whose narrative included the string ''pneumonia'' (''Pneumonia ICD-9 codes'': 480-483, 485-487); 2) a new prescription for antibiotics of a class of commonly used to treat pneumonia (cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillins); 3) admission to the hospital, for any reason, within 48 hours of the index outpatient visit (''(Not) Admitted to Hospital''); 4) chest imaging performed (''Imaging Obtained''); 5) whether at least one chest imaging report related to the index visit was labeled ''non-negative'' by the automated text classifier described above (''Text of Imaging Reports''). Performance measures. The performance of the pneumonia CDAs was summarized with standard test descriptors (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F-measure (2 * PPV * Sensitivity/(PPV + Sensitivity)). Denominators used to calculate these tests were either the whole study population (n = 2747), those patients who were hospitalized for any reason following their index visit (n = 602) or those who were not (n = 2145).",

With the possible exception is CDA 7, whose Fmeasure was the highest achieved in this study, the OR Text of Clinical Notes component did not add further value to CDAs that already included analyses of the chest imaging reports (compare CDA 7 to 5 and 14 to 12, Table 3 ; CDA 21 to 19 and 28 to 26, Table 4 ; CDA 35 to 33, Table 5 ). Table 4 ) and was in large part due to flagging of follow-up rather than initial pneumonia visits (data not shown). PPVs actually increased for patients admitted to the hospital (CDA 33, 35, Table 5 ). Discussion Automated text analyses of chest imaging reports improved the performance of EMR-based CDAs that included structured data elements and free-text search for ARI symptoms. This contribution persisted across pneumonia case definitions, applied to outpatients and hospitalized patients alike, and helped CDAs reach precisions of 64-86% while maintaining sensitivities of 58-75%. These data support our working hypothesis that selected free text analyses can supplement structured EMR data to assess the severity of ARI outbreaks. This work benefits from prior efforts to combine EMR data to identify patients with ARI. The ARI CDA used as an initial screen for the current study had been developed and validated against a population-based sample of over 15,000 EMR records, where it recognized 99% of cases that satisfied a broad definition of ARI [10] . This screening algorithm forms a practical starting point for an EMR data flow intent on monitoring the incidence and severity of ARIs, and is likely to have flagged most symptomatic pneumonia patients.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is seldom a definitive diagnosis, even when histological information is available [15] . Absent a standard, we sought clinically acceptable case definitions that could be reliably abstracted from clinical records. As is both customary and recommended by treatment guidelines [16] [17] [18] [19] , our case definitions required supportive chest imaging. To this common imaging requirement, the Possible-Pneumonia definition added clinical symptoms whereas Pneumonia-in-Plan relied solely on the provider's final diagnostic assessment. Despite these differences, more than 95% of patients with Pneumonia-in-Plan also satisfied the more permissive Possible Pneumonia definition in both our development and validation reference populations, indicating that the two definitions addressed related clinical conditions. Given that independent EMR abstractors could identify respiratory symptoms [10] , pneumonia diagnostic impressions and supportive chest imaging with a high degree of agreement, our data suggest that the Possible Pneumonia and the Pneumonia-in-Plan case definitions can serve as useful tools to reproducibly retrieve pneumonia-related information from an EMR. Prior attempts to automatically identify pneumonia patients through medical records have concentrated on diagnostic codes assigned after hospital discharge. Discharge codes have been found to be good markers for hospitalized pneumonia patients, whether benchmarked against retrospective record reviews [20] [21] [22] or prospective data acquired for clinical trials [23] [24] [25] [26] . Discharge codes, however, are of limited value in epidemic surveillance because they are untimely and do not distinguish between community-and hospital-acquired pneumonia [22] . In this study, we evaluated diagnostic codes assigned by providers at the conclusion of outpatient visits, as is practiced at the Veterans Administration health system. We found these codes to represent a key component of pneumonia detection, even if they proved less accurate at finding pneumonia patients who were sent home rather than hospitalized [27] . While the utility of diagnostic codes vary when they are assigned by third parties or have reimbursement repercussions, our results nevertheless provide an impetus for diagnostic codes to be made available as soon as possible following outpatient services, so that they can be used for surveillance, decision support and quality control.",

            "text": "The chest imaging report has long been recognized as a fruitful context in which to mine for evidence of pneumonia. Over the last 20 years, various combinations of approaches, including natural language processing [28] [29] [30] [31] , expert rules [32, 33] , Bayesian [32, 34] or neural networks [35] and machine-learning [33] , have held their own compared to physicians for their ability to find pneumonia-related concepts in report narratives. Imaging report analyses have been compared to discharge diagnostic codes [36, 37] , but have seldom been evaluated for their added value against a broader reference standard for clinical pneumonia [38] [39] [40] . To our knowledge, only one previous publication used imaging report analyses to detect outpatients with communityacquired pneumonia [40] . Besides bolstering the evidence for the utility of these text analyses, our data illustrate the importance of targeting them properly: in the course of this study, classifying 26,581 imaging reports did more to improve detection performance than extracting ARI symptoms from almost 14 million clinical notes. Although an assessment of the significance of the performance gained through imaging report text analysis must await purpose-specific evaluations, our data nevertheless support the notion that a generalized machine learning approach can perform well across information retrieval tasks [13, 14] . Also significant, in our view, is the ease with which we could develop the classifier. Clinical users focused on the document-level classification needed to create the reference training set. Once the latter was fed to the ARC software, model development required little further user interaction, and there was no need for custom programming. Such an efficient workflow makes it possible to quickly rebuild the classifier elsewhere, should it proves less robust than our validation exercise suggests.",

            "text": "Our study is subject to limitations beyond those already mentioned. First, we did not evaluate CDA components that have been associated with pneumonia in the past such as abnormalities in vital signs [41] , white blood cell count [42] or oxygenation [41] , and microbiological results. While these data elements could be missing in some patients [43] , they could provide an opportunity to further improve detection performance. Second, our work was performed in a health system whose population and health care practices may not be generalizable. Even if diffusion of our approaches was initially restricted to VA institutions, at least some automated pneumonia surveillance could nevertheless be deployed across all 50 states. Third, sampling was not random but instead based on a screening algorithm. While this algorithm has been validated using a random, population-based sample, our study sample remains subject to verification bias [44] such as the systematic exclusion of pneumonia patients for whom chest imaging was not obtained [45] . Fourth, the retrospective nature of the record review coupled with shortcomings of clinical acumen and chest imaging [46] imply that we may have missed pneumonia patients whose symptoms, signs or imaging abnormalities were absent [46, 47] , missed, atypical, inadequately documented or miscoded [23] . Despite these potential failings, our results do reflect information committed to a real-world EMR, and thus represent a realistic environment in which to compare the relative performance of alternative detection approaches. In summary, our results indicate that an EMR-based approach that couples queries of structured data with text analysis of imaging reports can be used to assess disease severity in outpatients with ARI. By identifying high-performing yet parsimonious CDAs that could be replicated without creating customized software, our results begin to map an efficient strategy by which pneumonia surveillance could be more widely implemented.",
