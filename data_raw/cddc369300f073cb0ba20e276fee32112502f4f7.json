In contrast to most other coronaviruses, which cause mild infection, the new SARS-CoV has a high mortality rate. Because the re-emergence of SARS is possible due to existence of SARS-CoV like strains in animal reservoir, development of safe and effective vaccines is highly desired. The SARS-CoV genome is composed of single positive stranded RNA and encodes four main structural proteins including spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [2] . The S protein is involved in not only receptor recognition but also in virus attachment and its entry into target cells [3] .",

Using DNA vaccines, both humoral and cellular immune responses are induced [4] . A few studies demonstrated that DNA-based vaccines can induce protective immune response against several viruses [5, 6] . However, one of the problems with DNA-based vaccines is that they are incapable of inducing immune response in mice when injected through the intranasal (i.n.) route [7] . In light of the fact that the entry of most respiratory diseases is through the mucosal surface, it is obvious and ideal that a vaccine should induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Secretory IgA plays a major role in mediating mucosal immunity [8] . Mucosal immune responses take an important role as a first line of immune defense system against influenza virus infection although parenteral immunization is not enough to provoke protective immunity [9] .",

Representative energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) images of the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles at N/P ratio 10 are shown in Figure 1B . The nanoparticles were observed as spherical shape with around 200 nm size, which are similar to those measured by dynamic light scattering. It is notable that cytotoxicity of PEI was measured in RAW 264.7 cells after transfection with PEI/ pci-S complexes by using MTT assay. The cell viabilities decreased slightly when the N/P ratios of PEI/pci-S complexes increased. When the N/P ratio was 10, the cell viability was 87.5 \u00b1 7.3% (data not shown). In order to confirm PEI/pci-S uptaken by RAW264.7 cells, rhodamine labeled pci-S DNA was used to form the nanoparticles with the PEI and the complex was visualized by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 1C , the labeled nanoparticles can be seen in the cells, near to the nucleus. RT-PCR analysis showed both pci-S DNA and PEI/pci-S nanoparticles can transfect the cells. In fact, the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles induced much stronger S mRNA expression than that of naked DNA ( Figure  1D ). Western blot analysis further confirmed that the cells treated with PEI/pci-S nanoparticles can induce the expression of detectable S protein whereas no protein was detected when pci-S was used alone ( Figure 1E ).",

To access the balance of Th1/ Th2 response, SARS S-specific IgG1 and IgG2 were evaluated in immunized mice. SARS S-specific IgG1 antibody was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine plus PEI whereas little increase was observed on SARS-specific IgG2a antibody production (Figure 2A ), indicating Th2 dominant response. To examine mucosal antibody production, lung wash, nasal wash, fecal extracts, saliva and vaginal wash of immunized mice were collected.

As SARS is a respiratory pathogen, among the SARS vaccine candidates, targeting intranasal immunization was likely to be more effective to induce protective immune responses against infection when compared with other delivery routes. Intranasal immunization of PEI/pci-S complexes induced higher antigen-specific serum IgG responses than pci-S alone. Coincidently, antigen-specific IgG1 was also dramatically increased when compared to IgG2a, suggesting Th2 dominant response. Also the immunization enhanced antigen-specific IgA response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and B cell proliferation after in vitro re-stimulation with the spike protein. In Garzon's study, antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses have been dose-dependently increased in mice immunized with DNA vaccine up to 100 \u03bcg [20] . However, in our study each mouse was immunized with only 20 \u03bcg of DNA. Despite the small amount of DNA, it has induced not only systemic but also mucosal immune responses. DCs play a pivotal role for the effective induction of antigen-specific immune responses. DCs are found throughout the body and are considered as one of the first-line sentinel cells [21] . When DCs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, DCs became mature and acquired capacity for the antigen presentation, concomitantly augmented the expression of MHC proteins [22] , cytokines [23] and number of co-stimulatory molecules including CD80, CD83, and CD86 [24] . Thus, the maturation of DCs is essential for appropriate initiation of the subsequent adaptive immune responses [22] . In the present study, we demonstrated that the PEI/pci-S complexes increase the co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules on DCs from cervical lymph nodes after intranasal immunization.",

Functional study indicated that antigen-specific T cells produce cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-17 after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS spike peptides. IFN-\u03b3 is an effector cytokine, critical for activating macrophages and DCs and inhibiting viral infection [25] . TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that probably regulates immune cells and inhibits viral replication [26] . IL-2 mediates the expansion of T cells and maintains memory T cells [27] . IL-17 mediates the production of antimicrobial peptide and immunoglobulin for neutralizing viral infection [28] . In the current study, we have shown that antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreted IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-17 in nonlymphoid tissues such as lung. Furthermore multiplecytokine producing cells are increased in mice immunized i.n. with PEI/pci-S. It is probable that these cells are likely responsible for the protection when host is infected with SARS-CoV after the vaccination. In fact, it has been suggested that multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific CD4 + T cells are functionally superior on protection to single-cytokine producing cells [29] . There are several reports that multi-cytokine producing T cells have shown to correlate with protection against Leishmania major infection [30] . In the current study, the PEI/pci-S complexes induced a high frequency of TNF\u03b1 + IL-2 + CD4 + T cells and IFN-\u03b3 + IL17 + CD4 + T cells, and TNF-\u03b1 + IL-2 + CD8 + T cells when assessed by SARS peptide recall responses.
