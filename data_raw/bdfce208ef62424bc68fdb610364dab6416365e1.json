Powered by the natural diversity of immune response, hpAbs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses. We previously showed that transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH) and kappachain (hIGK) germline loci (named as \u03baHAC) are capable of producing functional hpAbs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML1, are homozygously inactivated (double knockouts or DKO). However, B lymphocyte development in these Tc cattle is compromised, and the overall production of hpAbs is low. Here, we report the construction of an improved HAC, designated as cKSL-HAC\u0394, by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the HAC. Furthermore, for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane \u03b1 and \u03b2 immunoglobulins (bIg\u03b1 and bIg\u03b2) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, we partially replaced (bovinized) the hIgM constant domain with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM) that is involved in the interaction between bIgM and bIg\u03b1/Ig\u03b2; human IgM bovinization would also improve the functionality of hIgM in supporting B cell activation and proliferation. We also report the successful production of DKO Tc cattle carrying the cKSL-HAC\u0394 (cKSL-HAC\u0394/ DKO), the dramatic improvement of B cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpAbs (as measured for the human IgG isotype) in the plasma. We further demonstrate that, upon immunization by tumor immunogens, high titer tumor immunogen-specific human IgG (hIgG) can be produced from such Tc cattle.",

For example, hpAbs derived from the plasma donated from the general population have been widely used to treat autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases [2] , and hpAbs from recovering patients or pre-vaccinated individuals are effective in treating infections caused by the same pathogens [3, 4] . Human polyclonal antibodies are also used in medical emergency crisis situations such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks [5] . However, the availability and applications of hpAbs are currently limited. A paucity of voluntary human donors has resulted in a severe shortage of hpAbs, and donor-patient disease transmission concerns as well as a lack of reproducibility restrict their usage [6] .",

            "text": "To address the medical demand for hpAbs, different alternatives have been explored to substitute or even replace human plasma-derived hpAbs. For example, IgG or Fabs (fragments of antigen binding), prepared from the plasma of immunized horses or sheep has been widely used to treat severe envenomation resulting from snake and spider bites [7, 8] . However, animal derived IgG tends to cause immune reactions from treated patients. For example, it has been reported that rabbit derived anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) causes serum sickness in patients in several clinical applications [9, 10] . Recently, an in vitro antibody production system based on recombinant DNA and mammalian cell culture technologies has been in the development by Symphogen A/S [11] . This approach tries to mimic polyclonal nature of humoral immune response by producing mixtures of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize multiple epitopes of an antigen. Such an approach, if successful, has the potential to produce antibody mixtures in large quantities within a well defined system, allowing for improved reproducibility and elimination of the risks associated with human plasma-derived hpAbs. However, these antibody mixtures do not fully take advantage of the vastness of antibody diversity generated by natural immune responses. Additionally, as pre-defined antigens are needed to identify the mAbs and a lengthy process is needed to engineer cell lines expressing the recombinant mAbs, this system may not be useful for treatment of diseases in which antigens are not well characterized, such as in autoimmunity, nor in dealing with sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the 2002 SARS epidemic [5] .",

In these cattle, the production of serum hpAbs, as measured for its hIgG isotype, was only up to 1.5 g/l which is significantly lower than the physiological serum IgG levels of approximately 5-10 g/l in normal humans. The level of fully hIgG (hIgG kappa; hIgG/ hIg\u03ba) was even lower, at only approximately 0.65 g/l [12] . Further analysis of the Tc cattle showed suboptimal development of B cells, indicating that the low hIgG production in these Tc cattle is the result of poor B cell development [12] .",

            "text": "The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), comprising of IgM and invariant surrogate light-chains VpreB and lambda5 (\u03bb5), plays critical roles for pre-B cell proliferation and maturation during B lymphogenesis [13] . It transmits B cell proliferation and maturation signals to the nucleus through its interaction with the B cell transmembrane proteins \u03b1 and \u03b2 immunoglobulins (Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2) [14] [15] [16] . We reasoned that the poor B cell development and low hIgG production in the previously produced Tc cattle could be due to a compromised function of pre-BCR, as in the HAC/DKO cattle the bIgM in the pre-BCR complex is replaced by hIgM. Specifically, we speculated that, due to the difference in protein sequences between human and bovine IgMs, hIgM may not interact with bovine surrogate lightchains effectively; similarly, the functional interaction between the CH-TM domains of hIgM with the bovine Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 proteins for transmitting the cellular signals from a pre-BCR to the nucleus may also be compromised. Therefore, in an effort to improve B cell development and hIgG production in Tc cattle, we sought to enhance pre-BCR function by engineering a new HAC into which, in addition to the hIGH, hIGK and hIGL chromosome loci that carry the entire human immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the human VpreB (hVPREB1) and \u03bb5 (hIGLL1) genomic loci from human chromosome 22 (hChr22) was incorporated, and part of CH and TM domains, CH2-TM, of hIGHM gene, was replaced by the corresponding bovine gene sequence (bovinization of the CH2-TM domains of hIGHM). As IgM interacts with surrogate light-chains and Ig\u03b1/Ig\u03b2 via its variable (V) and CH-TM domain, respectively, such modifications would restore the natural intra-species proteinprotein interactions in the pre-BCR ( Figure 1 ). We also envisioned that the bovinized CH-TM domain would also improve the functionality of hIgM in interacting with bovine B cell proteins that are involved in B cell activation and proliferation. Our results showed that DKO Tc cattle carrying the modified HAC have greatly improved B cell development and produced up to 9 g/l of hIgG in the plasma. Through immunization studies, we further demonstrated that these Tc cattle are responsive to immunization with the tested tumor antigens and produce high titer tumor-specific hIgG.",

We employed a Cre/LoxP mediated site-specific recombination strategy to delete the DNA sequences on hChr14 that are irrelevant to immunoglobulin locus. Specifically, we integrated two lox511 sequences into hChr14, one at the AL512355 locus (about 300 kb centromeric to the hIGH locus) and the other at AL391156 locus (about the 85 Mb centromeric to the AL512355 locus), through homologous recombination for deleting the 85 Mb sequences on hChr14 between these two loci ( Figure 2A ). In order to facilitate the identification of the correctly deleted DT40 cell clones, we also integrated a CAG promoter and a hisD selection cassette along with the lox511 sequence at locus AL512355 and the promoter-less puromycin (puro) gene along with the second lox511 sequence and a hygromycin selection cassette at locus AL391156, respectively (Figure 2A ; for the details, see Materials and Methods). Such strategy ensured that only the correctly deleted hChr14 acquired puromycin resistance and was sensitive to hygromycin and histidinol (hisD) (Figure 2A ). Post electroporation of the DT40 cells with a Cre-expressing vector; the correctly deleted colonies were screened by genomic PCR and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (data not shown). To prepare the correctly shortened hChr14 (labeled D) as one of the building blocks for the construction of the cKSL-HAC\u0394, it was further modified by integrating a loxP sequence and a GFP reporter cassette at the RNR2 locus as described in Materials and Methods and previously [12] . Through extensive genomic PCR analysis (data not shown) and FISH ( Figure 2B ), a DT40 clone, 14D, was confirmed to have the loxP integration at the desired locus and selected for the bovinization of the CH2-TM2 domain of hIgM (see below).",

Even though the total hIgG levels varied among these Tc calves, the overall total hIgG production was found to be dramatically improved compared to the \u03baHAC/DKO Tc animals, at levels comparable to the physiological hIgG levels found in healthy humans ( Figure 11A ). Nevertheless, the average level of fully hIgG (hIgG/hIg\u03bb/\u03ba) produced by cKSL-HAC\u0394/DKO calves was about 0.383 g/l which is only about 8.5% of the total hIgG. This is not unexpected, as the bovine immunoglobulin light-chain genes, lambda and kappa, were not genetically knocked out in such Tc cattle, the expression of human light-chain loci on the HAC would be easily overwhelmed by the endogenous bovine light-chain locus resulting in the produced hIgG mostly to be chimeric (hIgG/bIgk/l). We also analyzed the IgG subclass distribution in the plasma of such Tc animals and showed that IgG1 is the dominant subclass (hIgG1/hIgG2 ratio >1) which is similar to what is observed in the plasma of healthy humans ( Figure 11B ). Therefore, we produced Tc cattle expressing physiological levels of hIgG with a subclass distribution profile similar to that of healthy humans. ",

To evaluate antibody titers specific to the tumor cells, we collected sera from each of the immunized Tc cattle at 14 days post second vaccination (V2) and performed flow cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. As shown in Figure 11c , Tc calves readily responded to immunization and generated high hIgG titer against human oral squamous cell carcinomas post V2 as demonstrated by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of tumor cells stained with the sera from immunized cattle. Furthermore, when MFI was measured by using anti-human kappa antibodies (to detect fully hIgG staining of the tumor cells, see Materials and Methods), measurable MFI was detected even after a 10,000-fold dilution of the sera. However, the titer against human tumor cells from fully hIgG is significantly lower than that from total hIgG.

            "text": "There are numerous technical challenges in producing fully hpAbs totally independent of the human immune system. First, as the human immunoglobulin genes and gene segments exist as gene clusters spanning large regions on three chromosomes, the only feasible way currently of delivering such a large size of human genomic DNA into a biological system for hpAbs production is through the engineering of HACs that comprise all or most of the human Ig genes. We report here the successful engineering of a HAC comprising the entire hIg gene repertoire that reside on three different human chromosomes, i.e. the IgH locus from hChr14, the Igk locus from hChr2, and the Ig\u03bb and surrogate light-chain loci from hChr22. The second challenge for fully hpAbs production by a recombinant system is to have a biological mechanism to efficiently tap into the genetic information provided by the immunoglobulin gene repertoires for generating the seemingly unlimited diversity of hpAbs. The mammalian humoral immune system is currently the only conceivable biological system that has such functionality. Therefore, we set out to develop a Tc animal system for fully hpAbs production. We chose bovine for the large body size, which makes it feasible to collect large volumes of plasma, a prerequisite for producing large amounts of therapeutic hpAbs. However, our initial success in producing antigen-specific fully hpAbs in the Tc cattle system was limited by the relatively low levels of total hpAbs production and the low level of fully hpAbs production [12] . In this report, we addressed this issue by improving the pre-BCR function through incorporating the human surrogate light-chain genomic locus into the HAC and by bovinizing the HAC in the hIgM domain that is involved in interacting with bovine Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signal molecules in the pre-BCR complex. Our results showed that restoring intra-species interactions between proteins in pre-BCR had a positive impact on Tc bovine B cell development as demonstrated by the increased development of IgM + /CD21 + B cells in newborn Tc calves ( Figure 10) . Very importantly, a dramatic improvement in total hIgG production was shown in these Tc calves as compared to our previously reported \u03baHAC/DKO Tc animals, likely due to improved B cell development. Finally, we demonstrated that Tc cattle developed here are responsive to antigen immunization and generate high titer antigen-specific human polyclonal antibodies ( Figure 11 ). Therefore, we developed an improved Tc bovine system to produce large quantities of hpAbs.",

While such chimeric hIgG are fully functional in recognizing antigens (our unpublished data) and are likely much less immunogenic than fully animal derived antibodies for therapeutic applications, it is obvious that fully human antibodies are more desirable as a biotherapeutic. This is especially true for long-term, repetitive treatments. Therefore, we have recently knocked out the bovine lambda light genes by deleting the entire bovine lambda light-chain gene cluster (manuscript in preparation) and are in the process of knocking out the bovine kappa light-chain genes. Accompanying our efforts to genetically improve our Tc bovine system, we also have developed robust immunization protocols in Tc bovine for producing high titer immunogen-specific fully hpAbs. The fact that high titer antigen-specific hpAbs can be produced from Tc animals through hyper-immunization will offer great advantages over the human plasma derived hpAbs in that the titers to certain pathogens from human plasma derived hpAbs tends to be low and sources of convalescent plasma are often difficult to obtain.",

The genomic library was screened for hIGHM constant region by using a probe that was a PCR product (with PCR primer pair, hC\u03bc-FR). A 1.7 kb of Pml I fragment from one of the positive phage clones was cloned into Sma I site of pBluescript to generate pCH1S (F). Then a 1 kb of Sac I-Pml I bovine IGHM genomic fragment from plasmid pBC\u03bcAY37-95 (a clone containing IGHM bovine genomic fragment derived from lambda phage based genomic library [12] was subcloned into Pst I site of the pCH1S (F) to generate pCH1SSP (F). A 7.4 kb of the Sma I-Eco RI fragment from another positive phage clone was cloned into Eco RV/Eco RI-digested pCH1SSP (F) to generate pCH1SL. In parallel, a 3.5 kb of Sac I fragment from pBC\u03bcAY37-95was cloned into pBluescript and then the Xho I fragment of floxed CAGzeo was cloned into Van91 I site to generate pmAYSazeo (F). The Sac I fragment from the pmAYSazeo (F) was then cloned into blunted Eco RI site of pCH1SL resulting in pCH1zeo (F). As a final step, the dT-A cassette was cloned into Not I site of the pCH1zeo (F) to complete pCH1CAGzeo(R)DT(F).",
