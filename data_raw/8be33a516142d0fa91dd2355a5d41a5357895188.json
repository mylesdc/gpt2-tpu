            "text": "Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that represent a significant threat to public health at a global level. While the formation of alphaviral nucleocapsid cores, consisting of cargo nucleic acid and the viral capsid protein, is an essential molecular process of infection, the precise interactions between the two partners are ill-defined. A CLIP-seq approach was used to screen for candidate sites of interaction between the viral Capsid protein and genomic RNA of Sindbis virus (SINV), a model alphavirus. The data presented in this report indicates that the SINV capsid protein binds to specific viral RNA sequences in the cytoplasm of infected cells, but its interaction with genomic RNA in mature extracellular viral particles is largely non-specific in terms of nucleotide sequence. Mutational analyses of the cytoplasmic viral RNA-capsid interaction sites revealed a functional role for capsid binding early in infection. Interaction site mutants exhibited decreased viral growth kinetics; however, this defect was not a function of decreased particle production. Rather mutation of the cytoplasmic capsid-RNA interaction sites negatively affected the functional capacity of the incoming viral genomic RNAs leading to decreased infectivity. Furthermore, cytoplasmic capsid interaction site mutants are attenuated in a murine model of neurotropic alphavirus infection. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that the identified cytoplasmic interactions of the viral capsid protein and genomic RNA, while not essential for particle formation, are necessary for genomic RNA function early during infection. This previously unappreciated role of capsid protein during the alphaviral replication cycle also constitutes a novel virulence determinant.",

Alphaviral disease is broadly classified based on the symptomology associated with clinical infection. Arthritogenic alphavirus infections, such as those involving CHIKV, Ross River virus (RRV), and Sindbis virus (SINV), induce debilitating arthritis in infected individuals [10] . In contrast to the arthritogenic alphaviruses, infection with encephalitic alphaviruses may result in severe neurologic disease and significant mortality, primarily in young children [11, 12] . Regardless of disease symptomology the members of the genus Alphavirus exhibit highly similar single-cell replication cycles [10, 13] .",

            "text": "Mature infectious alphavirus particles are approximately 70 nm in diameter, and consist of two concentric protein shells divided by a host derived lipid envelope [14, 15] . The arrangement of the outer protein shell, consisting of the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2, and the inner protein shell, comprised of capsid protein, are arranged with icosahedral symmetry [14, 15] . The innermost icosahedral structure is the nucleocapsid core, which consists of the viral capsid protein and the RNA cargo. However, the assembly of mature alphavirus particles is a highly selective process as, to date, many characterizations of alphaviral particles have agreed that the viral genomic RNA is the predominant RNA molecule within the nucleocapsid core [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Several studies have identified a region of the genomic RNA associated with the selective packaging of the viral genome during the assembly of infectious particles. This element, termed the Packaging Signal, consists of a highly-structured region found within the open reading frame of the nonstructural polyprotein [16] [17] [18] [21] [22] [23] . While these studies provided an excellent definition of the cis-acting elements involved in the selection of the cargo RNA, they did not identify nor describe the interaction between the capsid protein and the viral RNA cargo [18] . The interactions between the alphaviral capsid protein and the viral genomic RNA is an under characterized, yet vitally important, RNA:protein interaction. Alphaviral in vitro assembly systems have largely indicated that the assembly of Capsid:nucleic acid complexes is a nonspecific process [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . However it should be noted that the direct interaction between the viral capsid protein and viral RNA has not been exhaustively characterized in the cytoplasm of infected cells, or in mature viral particles leaving our understanding of the molecular interactions between these essential components of the virus incomplete.",

A CLIP-seq approach was used to screen for potential sites of Capsid:RNA (C:R) interaction within Sindbis virus (SINV) particles and cytoplasmic nucleocapsid complexes. Interestingly, while the C:R interactions of purified viral particles are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, the C:R interactions in cytoplasmic RNA:protein complexes exhibit a discrete binding profile. Further characterization of these candidate C:R interaction sites showed a decrease in capsid interaction when the sites were mutated, and indicated that the sites are essential for efficient viral growth as mutation of individual C:R interaction sites significantly reduces the infectivity of the mature viral particles. Further analysis indicated that the C:R interactions are necessary at an early stage of virus infection and stabilize incoming viral genomic RNA. Moreover, the cytoplasmic C:R interaction sites represent a series of novel pathogenicity determinants as C:R interaction site mutants are significantly attenuated in a neurotropic mouse model of infection. Collectively, the results presented indicate a new role for capsid protein during the viral replication cycle and identify a novel determinant of viral pathogenesis expanding our understanding of how Capsid:RNA interactions regulate viral infection beyond particle assembly.",

The RNA components of cross-linked complexes were then fragmented via RNase digestion. The fragmented C:R complexes were then selectively immunoprecipitated from the lysates using anticapsid polyclonal antibodies (Supporting Information, S1 Fig) . From the immunoprecipitated materials, cDNA libraries were generated using an adaptor ligation process and deep sequenced. In addition to anti-Capsid CLIP-seq libraries, derived from purified virions and infected cells, nonspecific control libraries were also developed.

In contrast to the sequence coverage observed with purified virions, C:R complexes derived from infected cell lysates exhibit remarkable specificity. Co-precipitation of viral RNA and capsid protein was dependent on crosslinking and the use of antibodies specific for capsid (S1 Fig) . Subtractive analysis of nonspecific control and anti-capsid cDNA library sequencing data revealed several discrete regions of significant enrichment in the anti-capsid library (Fig 1C) . The most highly enriched regions correspond to the coding sequence of the structural ORF, in particular the E2 and E1 genes. Nonetheless, several minor peaks are found in other regions of the genomic RNA, including the 5' and 3' UTRs and the nonstructural and structural coding regions. Interestingly, these peaks do not correlate with the previously described Packaging Signal or other known cis-acting features of the viral RNA [13, 18] . To prioritize which peaks would be further characterized we utilized a statistical method to examine the relative enrichment of individual sequences against the entire subtractive data set. As depicted in Fig 1D, statistical analysis of these data indicated that several of the regions with substantial depth-ofcoverage were statistically enriched (as determined by Z-score) relative to other sequence clusters. Collectively, these data indicate that the intracellular C:R interactions occur at discrete interaction sites on the viral genome and that the C:R interaction sites found within the structural ORF are the most significantly enriched. For reference the graphs in panels B through D are aligned with this schematic. B) Coverage of anti-Capsid CLIP-seq libraries derived from purified, mature infectious viral particles. Depth of coverage is represented by the y-axis, with the xaxis representing nucleotide position. C) Depth of coverage for anti-Capsid libraries derived from cytoplasmic fractions. Plotted on the y-axis is the depth of coverage of the anti-Capsid libraries following subtractive analysis, with the x-axis representing nucleotide position. D) Statistical analysis of the data presented in panel C, with the y-axis indicating the Zscore of all represented sequences. The x-axis represents the nucleotide position, with all panels above being aligned with the indicated nucleotide numbering intervals. As described earlier, several of the intracellular C:R interaction sites were statistically enriched relative to others. These sites, henceforth referred to as nt9300, nt10100, and nt10400 based on their approximate nucleotide locations in the viral genome, were prioritized for further characterization. Initially, we sought to determine if the intracellular C:R interaction sites exhibited similar RNA secondary structures, or primary sequence motifs. Bioinformatic analysis of the nt9300, nt10100, and the nt10400 regions (including up to 100 flanking nucleotides) using mFold failed to identify any RNA secondary structures that were energetically favorable [32] . Similarly, analysis of the nt9300, nt10100, and nt10400 C:R interaction sites did not reveal primary sequence motifs, and did not overlap with known subgenomic promoter elements [33] . Nonetheless, bioinformatic analysis of the individual intracellular C:R interaction sites indicates that the regions identified as highly enriched C:R interaction sites are well conserved across SINV strains. As shown in Fig 2A, the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms, as determined by the sequence alignment of 25 independent SINV strains (Supporting Information S1 Table) , indicated that the regions of interest exhibited few SNPs. Numerous residues within the C:R interaction sites were absolutely conserved; furthermore, the overall incidence of SNPs was on average comparable to or below neighboring sequences that were not identified as C:R interaction sites.",

While this was consistent over multiple biological replicates, the observed differences in minus-strand accumulation are relatively minor. Analysis of viral gene expression by metabolic labeling of HEK293 cells at 6 and 12 hours post infection indicates that viral gene expression is similarly unperturbed by C:R interaction site mutation ( Fig 4B) . Additionally, host cell shutoff, as indicated by the relative intensity of the actin band, is equivalent at 6 and 12 hpi for the C:R interaction site mutants and wildtype SINV at equal MOI in terms of infectious units per cell.",

As such, we next sought to determine if the translational activity of the incoming viral genomic RNAs differed amongst wild type and C:R interaction site mutant viruses. To this end we utilized a reporter SINV strain that expresses Nanoluciferase internal to the nsP3 protein. This construct enables highly sensitive detection of gene expression early during infection, similar to previously described. To assess the translational capacity of the C:R interaction site mutants we developed a series of individual C:R interaction site mutants in the nsP3 Nanoluciferase reporter backbone.

Briefly, HEK293 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 infectious units per cell. After the removal of unbound viral particles the cells were harvested at 30 min, 1 hr, and 2 hrs post infection and assayed for nanoluciferase activity. As shown in Fig 5C , wild type parental virus exhibited steady expression during early infection. However, both nt10100 and nt10400 exhibited significantly reduced translational activity early during infection. Indeed, at 30-minutes post infection the normalized nanoluciferase activity was reduced 2.5-fold and 1.5-fold for the nt10100 and nt10400 mutants, respectively. At 1-hour post-infection the nanoluciferase activity of the nt10100 mutant was further reduced, approximately 4-fold relative to wild type levels. However, at the same time point, the nt10400 mutant exhibited an increase in nanoluciferase activity to more or less wild type levels, indicating that the defect imparted by the nt10400 mutant is short lived. Moreover, the nanoluciferase expression levels at two-hours post-infection for the nt10100 mutant are~2-fold less than that of wild type SINV; however, the nt10400 mutant has surpassed that observed for wild type SINV by approximately 0.7-fold.

Indeed, mutation of the individual C:R interaction sites reduces the RNA stability of the incoming genomic RNA; and, at least for nt10100 and nt10400, reduces or delays the translational activity early during infection. However, the deficit created by the mutation of the C:R interaction sites appears to be specific to the early stages of the viral molecular lifecycle. This notion is supported by the observation that, at late stages of infection, the steady state levels of the three viral RNA species are unperturbed, and the viral gene expression profiles are more or less equivalent. Therefore, we posit that the C:R interactions are critical for molecular events at the earliest stages of viral infection, and that the C:R interaction sites represent a means by which the incoming viral genomic RNA is stabilized, and perhaps licensed for translation. Once this initial critical event is surpassed, the biological role of the C:R interaction sites become less essential for reasons currently unclear. Regardless, diminished viral genomic RNA function early during the viral lifecycle appears to significantly impact the progression of infection [19, 34] .",

The alphavirus capsid protein is expressed as part of the structural polyprotein, which due to the serine-like protease activity of the C-terminal domain of the capsid protein, is autoproteolytically processed into free capsid protein [10] . In addition to its well-known roles in particle assembly, the alphavirus capsid of new world alphaviruses, in particular Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEE), is also directly involved in the shutoff of host macromolecular synthesis via the interruption of nuclear export [45, 46] .

These functions include the regulation of viral translation and RNA synthesis. For instance, the MS2 Coat Protein dimer binds to the viral genomic RNA of the MS2 bacteriophage to regulate the expression of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [47] [48] [49] . Similarly, the core protein of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) binds to the 5' IRES during infection where it modulates the level of translation in a seemingly concentration dependent context [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Furthermore, a similar mechanism of translational regulation has been reported for other members of the alphaviruslike superfamily, in particular members of the Bromoviridae, including Brome Mosaic virus (BMV) [55, 56] . However, unlike these previous reports where the capsid protein expressed during the course of infection serves to regulate viral gene expression, the observations reported here indicate that the incoming capsid protein's association with the SINV genomic RNA is necessary for viral RNA translation early during infection. Therefore, this phenomenon appears to be more similar to that previously described for Alfalfa Mosaic virus (AMV), where the association of the AMV capsid protein with distinct elements of the 3'UTR is required for RNA function [57] [58] [59] . Nonetheless, in contrast to AMV, the regulatory binding sites for SINV are found within the structural coding region of the viral RNAs. It is worth mentioning that this ORF, in the context of the genomic RNA, is indeed part of a large non-translated region.",

Additionally, members of the Coronaviridae require functional N protein, likely via the association of the highly charged N-terminal domain with the transcription-regulating sequences, to achieve efficient viral replication [61] [62] [63] [64] . Nonetheless, from the data presented here we are unable to assign a role for an alphaviral C:R interaction in regards to viral RNA synthesis. For, as reported above, the accumulations of the viral RNA species is similar between the individual C:R interaction mutants and wild type parental virus. This implies that RNA synthesis / promoter utilization is not negatively affected. However, it remains possible that degeneracy between the individual C:R interaction sites is able to compensate for this activity.

            "text": "The data above leads to the conclusion that the interaction sites of the SINV capsid protein with the viral genomic RNA identified in this study by CLIP-Seq, while not required for RNA function late during infection, are vital to early genomic RNA stability, and function. Moreover, mutation of the C:R interaction site diminished translation of the viral genomic RNA early during infection, likely resulting in increased type-I IFN production. Currently the precise mechanism of C:R-mediated regulation is unclear; however, the C:R interaction sites are clearly involved in the stabilization of the incoming viral genomic RNA and the regulation of early viral translation. We suggest a model in which capsid protein of incoming nucleocapsid complexes remains associated or re-associates with specific sites in the genome following nucleocapsid disassembly enhancing RNA stability and facilitating translation (Fig 8) . This is a working model, whether the effects on RNA function are due only to capsid binding, or could be affected by the binding of other RNA binding proteins at proximal or overlapping sites is unknown. Ongoing studies in the Sokoloski and Hardy laboratories have indicated that the C: R interaction sites may be common sites of virus and host protein binding. The precise role(s) and contributions of these interactions are currently being characterized. Further potential mechanisms include direct or indirect roles in the recruitment of the translational machinery, or beneficial host RNA-binding proteins to the viral RNA; or perhaps the evasion of toll-like receptors and RNA-helicase sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5, or the eluding of the host cellular RNA surveillance machinery such as the host nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway. While our data cannot completely rule out this possibility, we do not believe that the decreased RNA stability observed in the C:R interaction site mutants is due to nonspecific recruitment of cellular endonucleases (for instance RNAse L), as mutation of off-target sites does not result in an altered phenotype ( Supplementary Information, S3 Fig) . Whereas, the mutation of the C:R interaction sites reduced viral growth kinetics, likely as a result of decreased infectivity due to impaired genomic RNA function early during infection. In addition to their molecular role(s), the C:R interaction sites represent a set of previously unidentified pathogenicity determinants in that mutation of the C:R interaction sites significantly attenuates viral infection in vitro and in vivo. As shown in this study mutation of the SINV C:R nt9300 and nt10100 interaction sites reduced the viral load, pathology, and morbidity of a neurotropic SINV infection. These findings have great potential as a means by which viruses may be attenuated for the purpose of rational vaccine development. Given that C:R interaction site mutation limits viral RNA function early during infection, but not late during infection, implies that viral dissemination but not immunogenicity would be limited. However, further exploration is necessary, as not all C: R interaction sites resulted in complete attenuation; as the SINV.nt10400 mutant exhibited significant mortality and morbidity in experimentally infected mice. Currently, the precise mechanism behind this phenotype is unclear. One possibility being investigated is that this site is also bound by a host factor and this contributes to the phenotype observed with this particular mutant. It should be noted that while the C:R interaction at 10400 obviously is important in maintaining genome stability following infection the site may also play a role in the function of the viral subgenomic mRNA that this may be affected by the binding of a host factor.",

            "text": "Several studies have indicated that the association of the alphaviral capsid protein with viral RNA is nonspecific in regards to primary nucleotide sequence and secondary structure, and is likely driven by electrostatic interactions between the N-terminus of Capsid and the phosphodiester RNA backbone [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . While these studies primarily focused on the interactions of nucleic acids and the viral capsid proteins in vitro, it is highly likely that these observations are valid during bona fide infections as evidenced by the distributive nature of the Capsid:RNA interactions observed in particles. However, collectively the data presented in this report indicate that the interactions, or at least the strength thereof, between the SINV capsid protein and the genomic RNA may be context dependent. The disseminated pattern of binding of the viral genomic RNA to capsid observed in purified viral particles supports a model where the C:R interactions are largely nonspecific, and perhaps based on charge-charge interactions [25, 27, 28] . However, from this data set it is impossible to identify if the interactions between the capsid protein and cargo RNA are mutually saturating (where each capsid monomer interacts with~50 nt of genomic RNA), or unsaturated (where not every nt is associated with capsid monomer) but nonspecifically distributed along the length of the genome. Further examination of the pattern of binding observed in purified viral particles reveals an interesting phenomenon-there are two regions of the SINV genome where sequence coverage is greatly decreased. These regions roughly correspond to the previously described Packaging Signal, and the subgenomic promoter region [18, 67, 68] . Importantly, the decreased coverage of these regions cannot be simply explained by bias in the library generation (as is the case for the extreme 5' and 3' termini of the genome). In these instances, the decrease in coverage was due to genomic RNA having a 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail, which effectively prevented the linkage of the 5' and 3' adaptors as these RNA features were not modified prior to library construction. Nonetheless, decreased sequence coverage at the Packaging Signal could be potentially explained due to the presence of a high degree of secondary structure within the element. The nuclease fragmentation approach utilized in these studies is selective for single-stranded RNA, therefore regions with a high degree of dsRNA may be excluded from nuclease digestion. The net result would be the formation of RNA fragments that lay outside the region of interest / selection during the preparation of the cDNA libraries. Alternatively, if the capsid interaction is exceptionally avid at this location the fragmentation of the viral RNA may be similarly diminished, resulting in decreased library coverage at the Packaging Signal. Further analysis of the decreased coverage at the cis-acting sites is separate and ongoing research focus.",

However, from our data we cannot conclude as to the molecular context of these interactions, as the milieu of capsid interactions likely expands from monomers (or as some models suggest dimers) to complete intact nucleocytoplasmic cores. From our current data it is impossible to determine the molecular nature of the interaction in regards to protein:RNA stoichiometry and molecular context. Unfortunately, given the promiscuous interaction of alphaviral capsid proteins with nucleic acids (including DNA) deciphering the supramolecular nature of the interaction through a reductionist in vitro approach presents significant challenges [25, 27, 28] . Moreover, it is unclear if these interactions are exclusive of other C:R binding events, or simply the cytoplasmic C:R interactions with high relative affinities. It should be noted that the method of cross-linking used in these studies is inefficient, which increases the specificity but reduces overall signal intensity during the CLIP-seq analyses; it is therefore likely that the observed cytoplasmic C:R interaction sites are exceptionally stable relative to other C:R interactions.",

Alignments were performed using LAstZ with standard parameters. Only reads corresponding to the positive-sense genomic RNA were mapped to the reference genome sequence. Sequence coverage was clustered at the nucleotide level of resolution from the aligned sequence reads. Analysis of the clustered sequence data relied on a subtractive method whereby the sequence coverage of capsidspecific libraries was compared to nonspecific control libraries. For these analyses the coverage of both the Capsid and Nonspecific control libraries were normalized internally by dividing each base by the total number of represented nucleotides to gain a percentage which was then multiplied by an arbitrary amount to generate a standardized measure of each nucleotides relative representation amongst independent library sets. The resulting values from the control libraries were averaged and subtracted from the Capsid-specific libraries to generate a difference map (as shown in Fig 1C) . Z-scores for each individual nucleotide were calculated from the statistical mean and standard deviation from the subtractive analysis data sets. For these studies statistical significance was rigorously defined as nucleotide clusters with differential coverage values greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean, which correlates to a Zscore of~10 \u221225 .

After receptor mediated endocytosis the acidification of the endosome resulting in release of the nucleocapsid core into the host cytoplasm. Disassembly of the nucleocapsid core occurs shortly after endosomal release; and SINV capsid protein remains bound to the C:R interaction sites following disassembly. Retention of Capsid:RNA binding at the C:R interaction sites enables evasion of the host RNA decay machinery and rapid assembly of the host translational machinery. Collectively, these interactions lead to the efficient establishment of viral infection, including but not limited to the modulation of the host innate immune response resulting in viral disease and pathogenesis. Disruption of the C:R interaction sites (lower pathway), leading to the ablation of Capsid:RNA interactions, results in RNA instability and a reduction of genomic RNA function early during infection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006473.g008 Interactions between Sindbis Virus Capsid Protein and Cytoplasmic vRNA PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006473 June 29, 2017",
