            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to cause apoptosis of infected cells and several of its proteins including the 3a accessory protein, are pro-apoptotic. Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment, its role in causing ER stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells expressing the 3a proteins showed ER stress based on activation of genes for the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Since ER stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways, these were individually tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the PERK pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of eIF2a on GRP78 promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, and (3) ATF4dependent activation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) gene promoter. Activation of PERK affects innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and to increase IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased translocation of IFNAR1 into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity.",

Since the ER is the site for translation and processing of proteins destined for secretion or membrane insertion, many viruses, including the SARS-CoV exploit this organelle. During viral replication there is high biosynthetic burden on the cell for producing viral proteins. The accumulation of nascent and unfolded viral secretory and transmembrane proteins in the ER lumen can lead to ER stress and the downstream activation of multiple signaling pathways [8] . To adjust the biosynthetic burden and capacity of the ER for maintaining cellular homeostasis, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is activated. The UPR is a complex pathway that is mediated by three distinct signaling tracks initiated by the sensors inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) [9] . These proteins transduce adaptive signals to the cytosol and nucleus, leading to global effects on ER function [10] and recovery from ER stress. But, prolonged ER stress can also trigger apoptosis.",

The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) affects UPR through activation of the PERK and IRE-1 branches but spares the ATF6 pathway [19, 20] . A cytopathic strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) induces apoptosis through UPR by activating the PERK pathway [21] . The S protein of SARS-CoV modulates UPR by the transcriptional activation of GRP78/94 and upregulation of the PERK pathway, but has little or no effect on the other two arms of UPR [4] . Since the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is also a transmembrane protein that localizes to the ER-Golgi region and plasma membranes of cells and induces apoptosis, we studied its effects on ER stress and UPR.",

To rule out induction of ER stress merely due to over-expression of a viral protein, we also studied the effects of the HIV proteins Nef and Vpu, and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) Orf3 protein, on grp78 and grp94 activation. A luciferase reporter construct driven by the grp78 promoter and either plasmid pSGI, pEGFP, pEYFP (vector controls) or pSGI-3a-HA, pEGFP-Vpu, pEGFP-Orf3 or pEYFP-Nef were transiently transfected into Huh7 cells. The cells were harvested 48 hr post-transfection for measurement of luciferase activity. We observed about 3 to 4 fold increase in luciferase activity in 3a expressing cells as compared to the vector control cells. The transient expression of HIV Vpu also gave a similar increase in grp78 promoter activity, HIV Nef did not show any effect, and HEV Orf 3 showed about 2.5 fold reduction in grp78 promoter activity (Fig. 1A) . We also tested the effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein on grp78 promoter in two other cell lines, COS and Vero cells, and observed similar effects as in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1A) . Activation of the grp94 promoter by the SARS-CoV 3a protein was also tested in Huh7 and COS cells. This promoter was also activated about 3 to 4 folds by expression of the 3a protein (Fig. 1B) . These results using two different ER sensor reporters, multiple cell lines and other viral proteins as controls, suggest that the 3a protein causes ER stress.",

We did not observe any significant increase in the cleaved ATF6f (p50) product arising from transfected FLAG-tagged ATF6 (p90) in 3a expressing cells as compared to control cells; however, treatment with thapsigargin led to increased levels of the p50 form (not shown).",

Compared to control cells, the 3a-expressing cells showed increased levels of phospho-eIF2a (peIF2a) without a concomitant increase in total eIF2a levels ( Fig. 2B) . We then cotransfected cells with expression plasmids for wild type eIF2a or its dominant-negative (DN) or dominant active (DA) mutants, pGRP78-Luc and either pSGI or pSG-3a-HA.

As shown in Fig. 6 , there was a significant decrease in the equilibrium levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-ECFP expressing cells compared to control cells. To verify involvement of the lysosomal pathway in reduced IFNAR1 levels, we also treated 3a-ECFP expressing cells with the lysosomal inhibitor, 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), which led to an increase in the cellular IFNAR1 signal (Fig. 6) , thus confirming a role for the lysosomal pathway in its reduction in 3a expressing cells.",

The IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways lead to reprogramming of the cell and induction of ER associated degradation, which reduces burden on the ER [33, 34, 35] . IRE-1 is a type I transmembrane protein kinase endoribonuclease [48, 49] containing three ER stress-regulated domains, which include a lumenal dimerization domain, a cytosolic kinase and an endoribonuclease [50] . Following ER stress, IRE-1 dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation and activation of its endoribonuclease activity. This causes unconventional splicing of the IRE-1 effector X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA that encodes XBP-1, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor and belongs to ATF/CREB family [51, 52, 53] . The ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein whose cytosolic domain is a bZIP transcription factor [37] . During ER stress it is translocated to the Golgi [54] , where its cytoplasmic domain (ATF6f) is liberated by regulated proteolysis and translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription [37, 38] . Our results show neither XBP-1 mRNA splicing nor ATF6 proteolysis in 3a expressing cells, suggesting that the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways are not activated in these cells.",

On activation, the PERK kinase causes phosphorylation of eIF2a, which leads to reduced translation of cellular proteins, but stimulates expression of ER molecular chaperones such as GRP78 and GRP94 [55] . Modulation of UPR by the 3a protein represents another function aimed at regulating the cellular response. Increased transcriptional activation and biosynthesis of ER chaperones would enhance folding of the 3a and other viral proteins in the ER lumen. The induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degredation (ERAD) to reduce the protein-folding load on the ER requires activation of the IRE1/XBP1 and ATF6 pathways. This includes ER degradation-enhancing a-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM), which is directly involved in recognition and targeting of unfolded proteins for degradation during UPR [33] . By activating only the PERK, but not the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways during UPR, the 3a protein potentially protects itself and other viral proteins from ERAD, while promoting the expression of ER chaperones and folding of proteins that have accumulated in the ER.",

The expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is known to have a pro-apoptotic effect, is activated by p38 MAPK as well as through the PERK signaling pathway [56, 57] . The over-expression of CHOP leads to translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria [58] . The CHOP-mediated death signal is finally transmitted to the mitochondria, which functions as an integrator and amplifier of the death pathway but the other mechanistic details of CHOP action are still unclear [57] . We show the 3a protein to cause increased phosphorylation of eIF2a, which is indicative of activation of the PERK arm of UPR [55, 59] . The activation of downstream effectors such as ATF4 and CHOP indicates yet another mechanism through which the 3a protein can be proapoptotic. Since the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 showed no significant effect on transcriptional activation of the CHOP promoter in 3a expressing cells, the p38 MAPK pathway is not likely to mediate these effects of the 3a protein. Overall, our results show that 3a-expressing cells respond to ER stress by activation of the PERK pathway, which enhances protein folding in the ER instead of activating ERAD, the latter being detrimental to virion biosynthesis. However, prolonged PERK activation would lead to apoptosis.",

The HIV-1 Vpu protein being a type I transmembrane protein [59] caused grp78 promoter activation but it did not significantly affect downstream effectors of the PERK pathway. The HIV-1 Nef protein, a membrane-anchored protein also did not show any significant effects on ER stress. The HBV X protein has been shown to cause ER stress [60] ; in our studies it caused mild activation of ATF4 and CHOP. Finally, the HEV Orf3 protein, which associates with cytoskeletal and mebrane fractions [61] , showed a reduction in ER stress measured through the transcriptional activation of grp78 and to a lesser extent that of CHOP. Interestingly, another protein of this virus, the Orf2 protein, was earlier shown to cause ER stress [62] . Thus, our results clearly show specific activation of ER stress and the PERK signaling pathway by the SARS-CoV 3a protein.",

            "text": "The co-evolution of viruses with their hosts has also led to viral evasion strategies, including those that limit the effects of innate and adaptive immunity [63] . An important innate response following viral infection is the synthesis and action of interferons [64] . Interferons (IFN) are synthesized and secreted by infected cells, and act on neighboring cells to elicit a variety of protective responses that limit the further spread of viral infection [64] . For interferons to act on cells, they must first bind their cognate receptors on the cell surface [65, 66] . Not surprisingly, therefore, one viral evasion mechanism is down regulation of the IFN receptor. Recently, ligand-independent downregulation of type I IFN signaling was observed in virus-infected cells [31] . This involved PERK activation during UPR causing the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. Since the 3a protein also activated PERK and its downstream effectors, we tested the effects of this viral protein on IFNAR1. Our results showed ligand (IFN)-independent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in 3a expressing cells, increased translocation of IFNAR1 to the lysosomal compartment for degradation and reduced levels in these cells.",

The cells were harvested at the indicated times, RNA prepared with Trizol and amplified by RT-PCR for the XBP-1 unspliced (XBP-1 u ) and spliced (XBP-1 s ) RNA forms. RT-PCR for histone mRNA was used as a loading control. (B) Huh7 cells were transfected with 1 mg of either pSGI or pSGI-3a-HA; untransfected cells were treated with 1.5 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min prior to harvest, as a positive control for ER stress.
