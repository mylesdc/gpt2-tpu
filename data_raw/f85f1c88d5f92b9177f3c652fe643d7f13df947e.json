            "text": "For the detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Using Primer Explorer software, four sets of primers were designed and RT-LAMP assay reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP was performed at different times by four primer sets. Agarose gel analysis showed that WYMV could be detected after 30 min with the primer set III and after 45 min with the other three primer sets, both under the 80-min reaction time. RT-LAMP had the same results with the four primer sets, thus primer set III and 65\u00b0C for 80 min reaction were selected for virus detection. There was no significant different when avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT-LAMP with the four primer sets and M-MLV was chosen due to its relatively cheap price. The result on specificity showed that the assay could amplify WYMV specifically, and the sensitivity comparison showed that the RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall, RT-LAMP was found to be a simple, specific, sensitive, convenient and time-saving method for WYMV detection.",

They were all available within 80 min, thus the primer set III seemed more sensitive than the others and was selected for virus detection under isothermal conditions at 65\u00b0C for 80 min in this study ( Figure 2 ). For each primer set, AMV and M-MLV RT-LAMP was performed and similar results were obtained, therefore, M-MLV reverse transcriptase was chosen for the subsequent RT-LAMP assay because of its relatively cheap price (Figure 3 ). The turbidity of pyrophosphate ions was observed directly after production of large amounts of DNA fragments during the RT-LAMP reaction. RT-LAMP reaction mixtures were used for turbidity observation with the primer sets I-IV after reaction at 65\u00b0C for 80 min. The healthy controls were relatively clear, whereas the positive samples were cloudy, and primer sets I and III more readily gave negative or positive results (Figure 4 ). This demonstrates that the RT-LAMP reactions are conveniently visualized by directly judging the turbidity and it does not require specialized PCR and electrophoresis equipment. The primer set III was chosen for the following experiments.",

The RT-LAMP assay was performed at different times and virus was detected after 30-45 min by agarose gel analysis, considering the field application where the turbidity will be observed by naked eyes as the criteria to judge that the sample is negative or positive, the reaction condition at 65\u00b0C for 80 min was used according to previous studies and the results obtained here. The RT-LAMP method had detection sensitivity about 100 times more than RT-PCR in the present study, which was similar to that reported by Boubourakas [33] . Therefore, RT-LAMP was demonstrated to be a simple and time-saving method compared with RT-PCR for routine detection of WYMV, and it did not require specialized PCR and electrophoresis equipment. Due to the high level of detection sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method, careful and strict operation was necessary during the whole process to avoid false-positive results [34] . Other factors to consider are DNA smear and turbidity. Similar to products generated by PCR, DNA smear was present in the healthy control, which may due to an excess amount of RNA used in the reaction and some non-specific reactions [31] . If the DNA smear is strong enough, it can influence observation of turbidity. Turbidity can be observed directly, but DNA smear can also produce turbidity when the concentration of RNA template is sufficiently high. Therefore, when turbidity is used to differentiate positive and negative samples, the amount of RNA template should be maintained at a low level.",
