There are a number of studies carried out to find its effective antiviral, however to date, there is still no molecule either from peptide or small molecules released as a drug. The present study aims to identify small molecules inhibitor from National Cancer Institute database through virtual screening. One of the hits, D0713 (IC 50 = 62 \u03bcM) bearing thioguanine scaffold was derivatised into 21 compounds and evaluated for DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitory activity. Compounds 18 and 21 demonstrated the most potent activity with IC 50 of 0.38 \u03bcM and 16 \u03bcM, respectively. Molecular dynamics and MM/PBSA free energy of binding calculation were conducted to study the interaction mechanism of these compounds with the protease. The free energy of binding of 18 calculated by MM/PBSA is -16.10 kcal/mol compared to the known inhibitor, panduratin A (-11.27 kcal/mol), which corroborates well with the experimental observation. Results from molecular dynamics simulations also showed that both 18 and 21 bind in the active site and stabilised by the formation of hydrogen bonds with Asn174.",

DENV infections can result in serious diseases including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and even death [5] . There are no approved antiviral drugs for these diseases and currently, patients are treated with supportive care to relieve fever, pain, and dehydration [6] . A tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDENV or Dengvaxia), the first dengue vaccine has recently been registered in several countries [7] . Despite being a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries [8] , this vaccine is not recommended for use in children under 9 years of age due to safety concerns [7] . Therefore, there exists an urgent need for antiviral therapies to treat dengue.",

Twenty of them were obtained from NCI for in vitro assay, out of which four demonstrated moderate inhibition towards DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro (IC 50 = 29-77 \u03bcM). Although Diversity0713 (D0713) is not the most potent compound identified in the virtual screening, the structure contains thioguanine (TG or 6-thioguanine) scaffold can be used as a template to develop a series of analogues as its simple chemical structure benefits feasible synthetic steps. TG showed 56% inhibition at 200 \u03bcg/mL (1.2 mM) indicating that even without any modification to the structure, the scaffold itself is able to inhibit the protease activity. This compound is a drug classed as anti-neoplastic agent and used with other compounds in treating leukemia [40] and has been investigated in many pharmacological activities such as immunomodulators in autoimmune diseases [41] and transplant graft rejection [42] . From this initial study, we are interested to utilise thioguanine scaffold in the design of DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitor(s). Thus, in this study, we designed, synthesised thioguanine analogues and investigated their possible DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibition activity. We hope that this study could contribute to the efforts in discovering novel and potent anti-dengue agents.",

The docking procedure was initiated by the preparation of NS2B/NS3pro as a macromolecule using AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.6) with default parameters for docking with AutoDock Vina. The exhaustiveness was set to 8 and other parameters were unchanged. The centre of the grid box was set at 30.71, 50.48 and 4.10 \u00c5 in x, y, z coordinates, respectively, with a box size of 25 x 25 x 25 points. The internal validation was done by re-docking the tetrapeptide inhibitor (Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Arg-H) with the RMSD value not greater than 2\u00c5. The external validation was done using panduratin A (a competitive inhibitor), that dock at the same binding site of tetrapeptide inhibitor.

In preparing both the ligands, the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged and Gasteiger charges were assigned. The grid box size and the grid spacing were set around the catalytic triad to 60\u00d760\u00d760 dimension and 0.375 \u00c5 respectively, with the centre set at x = 21.517, y = 43.428 and z = -1.743.

The 24 top hit compounds were investigated for their interaction with the active site's residues and ranked in term of the free energy of binding (\u0394G bind = -10 kcal/mol to -5 kcal/mol, see S1 Table. We identified that there are more than 50 ligands docked into the active site with that \u0394G bind range, but only 24 of them shows interesting interactions with the essential amino acid residues. The selection of \u0394G bind range is adopted from the study reported by Shityakov (2014) that Gibbs free energy of binding < 6.0 kcal/mol is clustered as active when this prediction is highly correlated with the experimental results with R 2 = 0.880; F = 692.4 standard error of estimate = 0.775 and p-value = 0.0001 [58] . This virtual screening study has a limitation in which no decoy database is being used to validate the docking protocol. The non-binding molecule could be selected over the true ligand called as false positive. Decoy database is the false positive hits which may improve the validity of the test by generating the true positive rate as well as enrichment factor. Unfortunately, the decoy for this DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro has not been available in a database of useful decoy (DUD dude.docking.org), therefore, the validation of this virtual screening only relies on internal control docking and by in vitro assay [59] .

Panduratin A was used as a control in this experiment. Previously, panduratin A was isolated from finger root (Boesenbergia rotunda (L.)) demonstrating competitive inhibition toward DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro with K i = 25 \u03bcM [31] . Thioguanine-based DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors D1855 demonstrated the best inhibition towards the protease activity at concentration less than 50 \u03bcM as the relative protease activity dramatically decreased from 100 to 30% (IC 50 = 29 \u03bcM). This inhibition is probably provided by the hydrogen bonding with Gly153 and His51 and the phenyl ring of the compound formed \u03c0-\u03c0-interactions with Tyr161 and His51 (Fig 4  (A) ). D1498 (IC 50 = 48 \u03bcM) is the second most potent of these four NCI compounds where the activity might be contributed by H-bond interaction with Gly151 of NS3, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between its anthracene ring with Tyr161 and \u03c0-cation interaction with His51 (Fig 4(B) ). D0713 also demonstrated significant inhibition towards the protease with IC 50 = 62 \u03bcM. The docked pose shows the formation of H-bonds between its amino groups with Asn152, Gly151, and Ser135 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between its guanine ring and Tyr161 (Fig 4(C) ). Although the IC 50 of D1853 is approximately 77 \u03bcM, this compound showed nearly 70% inhibition of the protease activity at 200 \u03bcM. As with the above NCI compounds, this ligand also formed \u03c0\u03c0 as well as \u03c0-cation interactions with Tyr161 and His51, respectively, in addition to the Hbond interaction between its amino groups with Gly151, Ser135 and Gly153 (Fig 4(D) ). Thioguanine-based DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors In our quest to identify suitable scaffold for designing potential novel and potent dengue protease inhibitors, we took into consideration the structure of D0713. Although this is not the most potent compound identified in the virtual screening, the structure contains thioguanine (TG or 6-thioguanine) scaffold. TG, a known drug used with other compounds in treating leukemia [40] has also been investigated in other pharmacological activities such as in autoimmune diseases [41] and transplant graft rejection [42] . In addition, its simple chemical structure also benefits feasible synthetic steps, thus, TG is selected as a template to develop a series of analogues. Therefore, in order to test our hypothesis, TG was subjected to the protease inhibition assay and it was found that the molecule showed 56% inhibition at 200 \u03bcg/mL (1 mM) indicating that even without any modification to the structure, the scaffold itself is able to inhibit the protease activity. Thus, TG was chosen as the lead structure in the design and synthesis of potential anti-dengue compounds.",

Interestingly, attaching an electron donating group (EDG) to benzimine at R 1 (3) showed high protease inhibition (IC 50 = 28 \u03bcM). These raised the idea to maintain the EWG group as a linker between the two aromatic rings of TG and the phenyl group which was modified to have EDG character.

Exploring placement at R 3 with an aliphatic hydrophobic group (15) also did not produce a compound with any improvement in the protease inhibition activity. At this point, it was decided to synthesize six more compounds with expected higher activities. Thioguanine-based DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors Inspired by 7, 8 and 11 where the compounds have amide group with promising inhibitory activity, six compounds (16-21, see Table 3 ) having amide group with diverse alkyl chains were designed. As the natural substrate of the protease is peptide, it made sense to incorporate amide groups into the inhibitor structure in order to mimic the peptide character. High activity of 18, 19 and 21 towards DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro (IC 50 of 0.38, 54 and 16 \u03bcM, respectively) could be due to this mimic of peptide character. Compound 18 with pentanamide chains at both R 1 and R 2 possessed the highest activity against the protease. However, attaching benzyl group at R 2 (19) dramatically decreased the activity from 0.38 to 54 \u03bcM. Interestingly, attaching benzyl group at R 3 significantly increased the activity to 16 \u03bcM. Compounds 16 and 17 have amide group extended by shorter alkyl chains showed moderate activity with IC 50 = 97 and 80 \u03bcM, respectively. To confirm the essentiality of amide group, in compound 20, the amide group at R 1 was omitted and at R 2, it was replaced with methylnaphthalene whilst at R 3 with isopropyl chain. As predicted, the activity of 20 significantly decreased with IC 50 = 258 \u03bcM. The activity-dose curve of compounds 18 and 21 are presented in Fig 6. ",

            "text": "Thioguanine was identified as a potential scaffold for DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitor based on virtual screening, in vitro assay and molecular modelling. The thioguanine scaffold is composed of pyramidine and imidazole rings attached to an amine and a thiol group which may contribute to the compound's activity. As far as we are aware, no report of pyrimidine inhibition to DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro, however, 2-(benzylthio)-6-oxo-4-phenyl-1,6-dihydropyrimidine has been reported to demonstrate an activity against SARS-CoV-3C like protease [61] . In addition, pyrimidine has also been shown to actively stop the growth of DENV-2 but it relies on the capability of pyrimidine to inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for viral pyrimidine biosynthesis [62] . Imidazoles have also been investigated against dengue virus [63] however the exact molecular mechanism or which protein they target is still unknown. The 6-thioguanine scaffold has been reported to non-competitively inhibit ubiquitin specific protease in various cancers [64] . With this background, we postulated that thioguanine derivatives might potentially be good inhibitors against DENV-2 NS2B/ NS3pro. Thioguanine-based DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors Two most active compounds (18 and 21) against DENV2-NS2B/NS3pro have an amide functional group (instead of an amino group). Amide is a part of peptide which is recognised as the key point for the protease substrate. In the docking study, the amide group is marked as a HBD with N-amide interacts with O-phenol of Tyr161 (in 18) and Asn152 (in 21) via Hbond. Previously, amide, such as \u03b1-ketoamide [65] , arylcyanoacrylamide [66] , and aminobenzamide [67] has been incorporated in the design of DENV NS2B/NS3pro inhibitors. The alkyl chain of 18 and phenyl-benzyl group of 21 demonstrate hydrophobic features and agreeable to docking results which show that these groups bound at the hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Val154, Ile86, Met84 and Val155. These also correlate with the decomposition energies as computed by MM/PBSA which highlight that the major contribution to the interaction with DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro is from non-polar interaction.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that the binding orientations from the MD simulations for both compounds are different despite sharing similar thioguanine (Fig 9) . The thioguanine moiety is facing toward His73 and Tyr183 for 18 and 21, respectively. Compound 18 has an acyl group at R 2 which provides additional electron lone pair enabling the formation of hydrogen bonds that can strengthen its binding towards NS2B/NS3pro. This reflected clearly in the hydrogen bond analysis where 18 formed more hydrogen bonds as compared to 21. Regardless of the slightly lower absolute binding energy from the MM/PBSA prediction, the binding interaction analysis of 18 with NS2B/NS3pro agrees well with experimental results. The Thioguanine-based DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors absolute free energies of binding for both two active compounds are also more negative than panduratin A supporting the in vitro results in which compound 18 and 21 better IC 50 value (0.38 and 16 \u03bcM, respectively) than panduratin A (56 \u03bcM).",

            "text": "We presented here the computational design of potential DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitors. From the virtual screening of National Cancer Institute Database, four compounds including D0713 were observed to have moderate inhibition activity on the protease. D0713 has a thioguanine scaffold in its structure prompting us to consider the scaffold for designing the new thioguanine derivatives as potential DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitors. Fifteen compounds were synthesised and the bioactivity against dengue protease showed variation in inhibition activity from inactive to moderately active (1000>IC 50 >18 \u03bcM). Based on this information, a further design of six new compounds was conducted by concentrating on the attachment of amide group. All the compounds showed inhibition activity against the dengue protease with compound 18 being the most potent (IC 50 of 0.38 \u03bcM). This result agrees well with the MM/ PBSA calculation which showed that the interactions are mainly contributed by polar and non-polar interactions. Hydrogen bonding analysis demonstrates the importance of amino acid residues Asn174 (occupancy 60%), Asp75 (8.22%), Tyr183 and Ser157 (2.85 and 2.73%). This is further supported by the experimental results which showed that 18 could be further developed as DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitor. It is hoped that the results obtained from this study could be used in designing more active compounds as potential dengue protease inhibitors. ",
