            "text": "Knowledge management as a field is concerned with the management of knowledge, including the management of knowledge in research processes. Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn's paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the 'crowd,' thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems. This paper seeks to contribute to this end, and to the recognition of the important role of social theory in the scientific research process.",

            "text": "Literature stresses the importance of social factors in HIV/AIDS epidemics, and the potential impact of emerging biomedicine 'and its attendant opportunities and (perhaps unintended) social consequences' (Friedman, Kippax, Phaswana-Mafuya, Rossi, & Newman, 2006, p. 959) . Although an extensive literature exists on progress toward visions of ultimate eradication (see Burman, Aphane, & Delobelle, 2016) , challenges such as ongoing societal stigma (Gilbert, 2016) , poor infrastructure and treatment delivery issues (Koto & Maharaj, 2016) and continued risk-taking behaviours (Ngidi, Moyo, Zulu, Adam, & Krishna, 2016) persist. This article makes the argument that certain recent developments in knowledge management enabled by technological advances offer hope for the ultimate eradication of HIV/ AIDS, and offers insights into how these novel developments might contribute to this end. HIV/AIDS, however, is not alone among a host of global disease threats. Rapidly spreading antibiotic resistance heralds a post-antibiotic era (Gallagher, 2015) , or antibiotic apocalypse (Ash, 1996) ; a world in which childbirth, even minor surgery, minor injuries and exposure to tuberculosis or other bacterial infections can be life-threatening. Similarly, climate change has been discussed in apocalyptic terms, or as a phenomena that, if not addressed, can result in large-scale loss of life (Feinberg & Willer, 2011) , and HIV antiretroviral resistance (Herman, 2016) might also have catastrophic consequences if it follows the same trend as that associated with antibiotic resistance. Knowledge management has to date, however, failed to offer outright solutions to these problems. This paper argues, however, that in light of recent technological advances, knowledge management and social sciences theory development can now offer an important complement to the 'natural' sciences processes of scientific research, with important implications for research problem-solving.",

            "text": "Certain reasons for the inadequate responses to these emerging threats have been mooted. It is possible that given exposure to knowledge of threats on an 'apocalyptic' level, or potentially catastrophic global threats, individuals may deny or discount their existence, exhibiting decreased willingness to address them (Feinberg & Willer, 2011) . There are other reasons for failure to address apocalyptic threats, and many other crises (not to mention global conflict) which might qualify for apocalyptic status, or have high potential human life costs. Whereas denial (Feinberg & Willer, 2011) might be one form of response to such imminent and serious threats, it is argued in this paper that another more useful response to these challenges is emerging, according to different literatures. This response is broadly categorised here as a trend in research and collaborative problem-solving termed probabilistic innovation, or innovative problem-solving processes which seek to dramatically increase the probability of solving problems through harnessing economies of scale in knowledge management. The key characteristic of this body of literature can be described as a focus on dramatically increasing the global intensity of collaborations between problem-solvers. What is novel, or new, about these movements is that they share a common characteristic, namely arguments for the importance of social science theory as a complement to natural science methods of scientific research. Further, this literature suggests bottlenecks to innovative research capacity can also have their roots in human behaviour and systems of researchers.",

Certain of the highest cited papers and most influential academic books were first rejected by journal reviewers and editors, including Nobel Prize winning manuscripts in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology and Medicine, raising 'important questions about current publishing policies which govern the dissemination of new information' (Campanario, 2009, p. 558) . In relation to the failure of Newtonian theory to integrate new theory development into its core, Lakatos (1970) argues that scientific progress can be constrained by the failure of theoretical frameworks to be responsive to new ideas, and that the structure of academic processes can hold back innovation.",

Further, 'critics often argue that peer review operates to regulate paradigmatic science (in the Kuhnian sense) rather than to welcome brand new knowledge' and there is therefore a 'real risk that evidence contrary to the established views can be suppressed or discarded' (Campanario, 2009, p. 559) . Empirical research in certain instances has been found to be associated with biases (Henrion & Fischhoff, 1986) , including 'file drawer bias' where studies failing to reject the null hypothesis literally remain in 'file drawers' (De Long & Lang, 1992) and serious concern has long existed across many scientific disciplines about the processes by which science is disseminated, in that theoretical innovation can be constrained by gatekeepers (Peters & Ceci, 1982) . Notwithstanding bias in theory testing methods, dissemination of theory for fair criticism and contestation is perhaps a necessary condition for the progression of science.",

Mahoney (1977, p. 161 ) documents a 'tendency for humans to seek out, attend to, and sometime embellish experiences that support or \"confirm\" their beliefs,' which has led to a bias against the dissemination of new perspectives, which is fundamentally at odds with Popper's (1972) notions of falsification, which require theoretical ideas to disseminate prior to their testing, or to provide opportunities for empirical falsification. Serious issues related to the resistance of academics themselves to scientific discovery Campanario (2009) seem to support Kuhn's (1962) and Lakatos's (1970) seminal arguments that constraints to scientific innovation can primarily have roots in human behaviour, and that social science has an important role in addressing these problems. Campanario (2009, pp. 550, 560) argues that the 'important topic of scientists' resistance to scientific discovery' is under-researched, as case studies show that 'scientists with something truly original to communicate often have to fight against the silence, the lack of interest, and as a result the absence of citations and recognition.'",

It is argued in this paper that developing a stream of literature, or a field, explicitly focused on maximising human collaborations (as a dimension of knowledge management) could act as a counterpoint to the rapidly burgeoning field of big data and information management and enable a curative paradigm in health as well as more effective problem-solving in social science. This paper seeks to identify and link literature in support of this objective, and to make an argument that this literature may usefully be synthesised under the banner of an emerging field, namely probabilistic innovation, driven by a social movement toward the democratisation of knowledge (and therefore science, medicine and social science).",

However, the extent to which higher volumes of human problem-solving inputs transmit to problem-solving outputs is difficult to predict. The lack of knowledge of constraints to this transmission is associated with ongoing social costs. Costs of lack of knowledge typically accrue to those most powerless in society, or those most vulnerable to crises.

The era of big data needs to be matched by a concurrent era of 'big knowledge.' One channel through which this might be achieved is enabling 'big collaborations.' Scale advantages associated with exponential increases in collaborations may increase probabilistic engagement with available data, and populate the problem space sufficiently. However, populating a relatively unpopulated problem space (big data) with human problem-solving inputs may require a radical approach. This paper argues that such a radical approach is possible, premised on principles related to the democratisation of knowledge. Use of the crowd, expert and non-expert crowdsourced research and problem-solving inputs, as well as a theoretical framework relating to proactively maximising collaboration through developing global systems, seems key to attaining this.",

An analogy might illustrate this challenge. If an airport could land and take off about a hundred aircraft in a day, exponentially increasing those landing would be akin to increasing problemsolving inputs using a crowdsourced R&D platform, and exponentially increasing those taking off to problem-solving outputs. Such an airport would then need to manage congestion in such a way to be able to land and take off hundreds of thousands of aircraft in a day. Posed this way, such a research problem might seem insoluble, at least at the scale discussed here. This research problem, however, if solved, holds the promise of radical innovations in socially important problem-solving. Solving cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, Ebola, antibiotic resistance, as well as a host of other problems might truly become a simple function of maximising problem-solving inputs, if these inputs could transmit to successful outputs. It is this logic this paper seeks to develop, with specific reference to literature related to how collaborative problem-solving can be maximised; with the ultimate aim to empower a social movement dedicated to an 'extreme' focus on problem-solving, or radical change based on the democratisation of science (Callaghan, 2015) .

Geographic, temporal and other logistic challenges make tacit learning between individuals even more difficult. Arguably, this is a dominant constraint to solving problems in biomedicine, as it is simply not possible to get large numbers of people to work together and enable tacit expert knowledge interactions using 'conventional' methods of collaboration. It is argued here that expert crowdsourcing, or crowdsourced R&D, has yet to be taken up as a viable alternative to conventional collaborations. Naturally, the question ariseswhy crowdsourced R&D -and why is its use in curative disease research not yet widespread, notwithstanding its extensive use in data collection and analysis in medical research?

For example, platforms like InnoCentive (InnoCentive, 2016) put biomedical and other scientific problems online for solving, in a process akin to open-source software development. The problem, however, is that unlike open-source software development, solutions become proprietary knowledge of the firm putting the problem on the site, and this knowledge is not released back into the crowd (Callaghan, 2014a) . Arguably, this is one of the reasons why crowdsourced R&D has not delivered the successes open-source software development has, such as Android and Linux. Nonetheless, it is argued that certain opportunities for harnessing collective intelligence through maximisation of collaborations discussed in this article can offer important insights to those in HIV/AIDS research.

A primary limit to maximising scientific collaboration is congestion. Study of motor vehicle traffic flows might offer insights relevant also to Internet traffic in general, and more specifically for the management of maximised crowdsourced R&D inputs. Problems of traffic flows are well researched; two different literature camps have emerged over time, namely physicists, arguing spontaneous 'jams' occur, akin to the movement of water or particles, and engineers, including traffic engineers who conceptualise jams to be caused by obstacles, which can therefore be managed, or removed (Surowiecki, 2004) . Traffic jam congestion has been the subject of simulation research (Munoz & Daganzo, 2002; Nagel, 1994) , and a body of literature exists which might be usefully applied to crowdsourced R&D applications in contexts of congestion. Modelling high volume Internet traffic relationships might offer useful insights into how maximum inputs into crowdsourced R&D processes can be optimally managed. If circularity in the use of the crowd is attained, such as crowd funding used to support crowdsourced R&D (Callaghan, 2014b ) the growth of the system might become financially sustainable, which may increase knowledge inputs at the cost of congestion. The 'airport' analogy research problem highlights the nature of these constraints.",

In large-scale crowdsourced data collection and analysis seeking to facilitate real time research, crowdsourced R&D inputs would therefore need to be differentiated according to their relative value to ensure overall costs of congestion from crowdsourced inputs are linked to benefits. Such a mobilisation of crowds of problem-solvers, expert or not, would require crowd management. Given the centrality of crowdsourced ideas and problemsolving to probabilistic innovation, the question arises as to what extent the crowd itself can solve the congestion problem, as the ultimate expression of collaboration. The crowd has taken on an increasing share of health-related research, in the wake of technological advances enabling connectivity.

Populating the 'coalface' of a problem landscape of global societal problem with very large numbers of human problem-solvers, who then respond to the unique configuration of the problem at each point of contact, necessarily requires support mechanisms, and some degree of quality control as well as appropriate incentives (Callaghan, 2015) .",

This process echoes the argument made in this paper, that the crowd holds the key to the acceleration of knowledge creation, as complex problems represent a large problem space, and real-time problem-solving might be better enabled through populating the problem space with large numbers of 'solvers.' Hyperspecialisation, and the way it is unfolding in the workplace, might offer unique insights that can be applied in the quest for real time research. While these changes offer proof of concept of how work can fit with highvolume crowdsourced systems (and that very large economies of scale are possible), these developments may also provide the basis for a synthesis of crowd-specific work methods with developing networks of large-scale collaborations. To maximise collaborations further, these sites could be networked, as part of a global sociotechnical system. Lessons for real-time response can also be drawn from disaster management, and how sociotechnical systems operate to achieve real-time outcomes (Callaghan, 2016) . Effectively, the development of a global sociotechnical system (or GPP to solve global societal problems) entails the democratisation of knowledge and processes, ensuring their contribution as a public good; this also entails engagement, and enablement, of different stakeholder groups (Shum et al., 2012) . Shum et al. (2012, p. 109 ) define collective intelligence as ' . . . behaviour that is both collective and intelligent,' collective meaning 'groups of individual actors, including, for example, people, computational agents, and organisations,' and intelligent meaning that 'the collective behaviour of the group exhibits characteristics such as, for example, perception, learning, judgement, or problem solving.' Increasing networked collaborations might be considered akin to the development of a social movement, based on open modes of knowledge creation, seeking to leverage collective intelligence.",

Organisations that post problems on the innovation mall InnoCentive.com follow the same hierarchical structure, as these problems are typically 'smaller pieces of the sponsors' much larger R&D programs' and these organisations usually have sound knowledge of relevant technologies as well as user needs and functional requirements (markets), which allows them to define system configurations and coordinate collaborator work (Pistano & Vergani, 2008) .

A typical innovation contest involves firms, termed 'seekers' who post innovation-related, or technical, R&D problems, for populations of independent agents, termed 'solvers,' to address using an open innovation process, typically with an award offered for the best solution (Terwiesch & Xu, 2008) . Individuals and online communities contributing ideas in open innovation processes have already been found to be motivated by altruism, competition for status, or the self-interest typically related to being a user; however, in addition solvers can also be motivated using innovation contests, or innovation tournaments. Examples of innovation contests include the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous robotic vehicles, and as discussed previously, InnoCentive, an innovation platform conducting hundreds of innovation contests annually in which about 95,000 solvers around the world compete to solve problems, mostly in molecular biology and chemistry (for awards that are typically between $10,000 to $50,000) (Terwiesch & Xu, 2008) .",

The success of a global knowledge creation system seeking to maximise collaborations may also be dependent on the rate at which the system can learn. The literature discussed in preceding sections is taken to represent work related to how collaborative research can leveraged to better solve research problems, or relating to 'collaborative leverage'; what links this literature is therefore its potential contribution to the goal of maximising collaborative problem-solving. Fig. 1 provides an overview of theoretical frameworks related to this 'collaborative leverage' theory. The theorists in the innermost frame are taken to represent those with perhaps the most salient contributions to collaborative problem-solving. Those in the outer frame are taken to offer theoretical frameworks which further support the collaborative leverage process. The identification, and potential integration, of these subordinate bodies of theory into a core body of literature to support maximised collaborative problem-solving systems is considered important, for the following reasons. First, it is argued technological advancements have enabled what is essentially a new paradigm in collaborative problem-solving, and that over and above accelerating trends toward collaborations (Adams et al., 2004) , a proactive attempt to 'catch' this building wave and operationalise its potential may result in dramatic improvements in global social problem-solving.",

Dominant in this body of literature is the simple notion that increased networking and collaborations can accelerate research and problem-solving, and that a radical approach to increasing these also required scholarly attention. Increased transparency and participation by stakeholders of all stripes is perhaps already changing the power dynamics of science and its problem-solving processes, reflecting a global shift toward probabilistic innovation; this shift is perhaps a necessary condition, in that the lack of outright solutions to apocalyptic problems sooner or later will trigger the necessity as 'mother of invention' effect, and people will ultimately start to 'self-organise' and begin to develop radical and novel solutions in response to these crises. This paper has sought to do just this, and to document emergence of these ideas. Further development of this stream of literature may usefully seek to document and investigate these ideas further. It is therefore hoped this paper has in some way contributed to this project.",

A body of theory was identified and incorporated into discussion of what might be an emerging field, relating to how global systems of networked collaborations could usefully contribute to a radical new paradigm of maximised collaborative problem-solving. It was also argued that these developments reflect a deeper movement, perhaps on the scale of a social movement, toward the democratisation of science and the involvement of all affected stakeholders as problem-solving collaborators in some form or the other. These changes might herald the advent of a new era of transparency, harnessing of collective intelligence and the involvement (and legitimisation of involvement) of the 'crowd' in matters that affect it.",
