A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p \u2264 0.01 to p \u2264 0.001). To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses. These findings suggest either some humoral antiviral response bias or more frequent viral exposure of certain individuals.",

Intact antigen recognition by IgG in therapeutic immunoglobulin products is gaged by the presence of minimal titers of specific antibodies expected in the general population in what is referred to as potency tests. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires potency tests to achieve minimal standards for Measles, Diphtheria, and Polio (FDA CFR 640.104). While these pathogens remain relevant at least to some degree -especially Measles -they are not infectious diseases specifically relevant to PIDD patients needing immunoglobulin replacement. Commercially available immunoglobulins are therefore not standardized for specific antibody content for the most common infectious diseases to which PIDD patients are susceptible. Studies of these titers in available products have reported wide variation (7) . How much specific antibody within a given dose of a therapeutic immunoglobulin preparation is needed to provide optimal resistance for PIDD patients remains an open question. One thing that is clear, however, is that increasing doses of standard polyclonal immunoglobulin are associated with decreasing incidence of infection in PIDD patients (8, 9) .",

In each case, the specific IgG against RSV antigens was evaluated by ELISA as well as the specific IgG against antigens prepared from eight other respiratory viruses. These included influenza A and B, hMPV, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, coronavirus OC42, and V299E. In each case, the mean ratio of the geometric mean of the titer of RI-002 to the commercial polyclonal IVIG preparations was higher in RI-002 (Figure 1) . The difference in these means achieved statistical significance for all but one of the viruses (hMPV, which demonstrated a trend toward significance). In aggregate, the mean titers were 1.5-fold higher in RI-002 and ranged from 1.4 to 1.7-fold higher depending upon the particular virus ( Table 1) . Not surprisingly, RSV was the highest. While other lots of IVIG showed a wide range of titers to the other viruses and often had a high titer to one virus but low titer to other viruses, RI-002 was consistent from lot to lot and demonstrated consistently high titers to all of the viruses. Importantly, since RI-002 is standardized to high RSV titers, the repeated findings of high titers to these other viruses across the lots tested here is likely to be a consistent feature across all lots prepared in the same manner. While the specific levels of anti-pathogen antibodies required in IVIG to provide protection from the many pathogens that infect patients with PIDD is unknown, it stands to reason that a greater quantity of antibody to a specific pathogen will provide a greater level of protection (12) . A number of variables also need to be factored into that equation, such as the actual quality (affinity and avidity) of the antigen-specific antibody as well as the inflection point past, which increasing titers become irrelevant to protection. Further study of exogenously applied immunoglobulin is required to gain the insights into both questions in a way that will translate into clinical efficacy. There is, however, evidence to suggest that having high pathogen-specific antibody in IVIG may translate into improved clinical outcomes with regards to that particular pathogen as was demonstrated for Streptococcus pneumonia and otitis (13) .",

To evaluate this, we prepared an immunoglobulin fraction from 20 randomly selected plasma donors containing high, medium, and low titers to RSV and measured their antibody levels to the other 9 respiratory virus antigens. A direct correlation was present between the RSV titers and those to all nine of the other respiratory viruses (Figure 2) . Thus, the higher the RSV titer values, the greater the titers to other non-RSV respiratory viruses. Likewise, lower titers to RSV correlated with lower titers to the other respiratory viruses. In each case, correlation coefficients were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and ranged from 0.29 to 0.67 log 2 scale (Figure 2 ; Table 2 ). The exact reason that RI-002 contains elevated antibody titers to other respiratory viruses is not entirely clear as is the reason for the positive correlation between RSV titer and that to other viruses in the immunoglobulin from individual donors tested. There are, however, a number of possibilities to consider. First, it is possible that certain individuals are high humoral immune responders either in general or specifically against intracellular antigens. Given the diversity in MHC and the concomitant linkages of MHC alleles to immunity in general, this is at least plausible. Specifically, individuals having particular MHC alleles have higher humoral response after viral vaccination (14, 15) . Thus, the donors who were selected based on their high responses to RSV may also have been high responders to other respiratory viruses. Whether these donors may also be high responders to pathogens other than respiratory viruses remains to be studied. Another possibility to account for the higher response of high-titer antibody RSV donors to other non-RSV respiratory viruses is that these donors may have experience to a greater diversity of viral infections. This could be a feature of their occupation or other demographic considerations that are not routinely considered in selecting plasma donors for the manufacture of therapeutic immunoglobulin. Given the diversity of high antiviral titers in both the IVIG preparation and the individual donors, we would hypothesize the former. Formal testing of elite antiviral humoral response, however, needs further study to establish this hypothesis. Moreover, whether these findings regarding the composition of a hyperimmune IVIG translate into clinical efficacy for protection against a diversity of infections, however, remains to be determined.",
