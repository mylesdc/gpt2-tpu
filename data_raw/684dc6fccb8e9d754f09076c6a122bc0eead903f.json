Since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly, alternative treatments should be investigated. We produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with EBOV virus-like particles, and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection. BALB/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal, at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi), in which all animals survived. To decrease the possibility of serum sickness, the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments, with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin. Full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization, other Fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival. Guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or F(ab\u2032) 2 at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from EBOV infection. These results justify future efficacy studies for purified equine products in NHPs.",

To investigate further, we first prepared purified anti-EBOV antisera via the immunization of horses with EBOV enveloped virus-like particles (eVLP), which consists of EBOV viral protein 40 (VP40) and GP. The equine antisera was then tested in vitro using a neutralization assay with recombinant EBOV expressing eGFP (EBOV-eGFP), as well as in vivo against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. To investigate whether EBOV infections can be controlled by virus neutralization alone, and to prevent the possible induction of serum sickness in humans that would be administered antisera, the post-exposure efficacy of F(ab\u2032 ) 2 (immunoglobulin treated with pepsin to remove the Fc regions of the antibody) were also investigated side-by-side with equine antisera in all experiments as a potential alternate treatment. Guinea pigs then were used to confirm the efficacy results from mouse studies, due to their status as a higher phylogenic species which more closely models hallmarks of EVD in humans. Additionally, prior to efficacy studies both the equine antisera and F(ab\u2032 ) 2 had been evaluated for safety in the Peking Union Medical College Center for New Drug Safety Evaluation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, which is certified by the Food and Drug Agency of the People's Republic of China.

The filamentous eVLP were observed under an electron microscope (Supplementary Figure 1 ) and confirmed to be morphologically similar to EBOV. Immunoblotting of rBV-VP40-GP infected Sf9 cell lysates demonstrated that the eVLP contained EBOV GP and VP40 (Supplementary Figure 2) . Three horses were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 7 injections of eVLP over 11 weeks and the hyperimmune sera were collected from each animal at specified timepoints ( Fig. 1A) to determine the serum titers by neutralization assay against a recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. A pseudotyped-virus was used for these studies to confirm the in vitro efficacy of the antisera preparations under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, before subsequent studies in the BSL-4 laboratory. Neutralizing serum titers were detectable after the 5th immunization at week 6, and increased until the 7th immunization at week 11 (Fig. 1B) . The serum neutralizing antibody titers of two horses were 1:40,960 after seven immunizations, and was 1:20,480 for the third animal. The equine antisera (purified by ammonium sulphate-based precipitation) was then digested with pepsin at a concentration of 5-10 U/ml for 45 to 90 min and purified to generate F(ab\u2032 ) 2 fragments. The purity of the antisera and F(ab\u2032 ) 2 preparations, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by thin layer chromatography, was determined to be 95% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 2) . Approximately 2000 mL of purified antisera could be obtained from each horse during each collection, with the stock concentration between 20-25 mg/mL. Up to 3-5 collections can be performed on each horse, therefore each hyperimmunized horse yields between 120 to 250 g of purified antisera.",

Control mice lost approximately 23% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a mean time to death (MTD) of 6.4 \u00b1 0.5 dpi. Five of eight mice given F(ab\u2032 ) 2 starting at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 18.7% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi; however, none of the mice given F(ab\u2032 ) 2 starting at 2 dpi survived the challenge (p-value = 0.9777, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 19.0% and a MTD of 5.8 \u00b1 1.8 dpi (Fig. 4A,B) . Five of eight mice given antisera at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 14.6% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4C ). Three of eight mice given antisera at 2 dpi survived (p-value = 0.0446, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 12.3% and a MTD of 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4D ). Comparing groups with equal treatment times, there was no statistical difference between F(ab\u2032 ) 2 at 1 or 2 dpi (p-value 1.0000 and 0.0613, respectively). However, given that multiple administrations of F(ab\u2032 ) 2 were required to achieve similar protection levels demonstrated by a single injection of antisera, the results suggest that equine antisera is a superior product to F(ab\u2032 ) 2 in terms of efficacy, possibly due to a longer in vivo half-life of equine antiseras.",

            "text": "The lack of BSL-4 laboratories globally, trained personnel as well as the rigors of working under high biocontainment conditions have severely hampered basic research with EBOV, leading to a dearth of vaccines and therapeutics for use in humans. These weaknesses were exposed with the 2014-15 EBOV crises, and highlight the value and need for basic and translational science that occurs prior to an impending threat. In an effort to save lives, several experimental candidate treatments that had been tested for efficacy in mice or NHPs, in addition to approved or nearly-approved drugs developed against unrelated pathogens, were expedited for use in humans under compassionate circumstances, with varying degrees of success 17 . Of these, antibody-based treatments appear to hold the most promise in the clinic and thus should be further investigated for use in humans. Passive immunotherapy against EBOV had been tried in the past. Towards the end of the 1995 EBOV outbreak in Kikwit, Za\u00efre (presently Democratic Republic of the Congo), the passive transfer of whole blood from EBOV survivors to patients resulted in the survival of seven out of eight recipients 18 . However, safety concerns with blood transfusions, such as the spreading of blood-borne diseases, allergic reactions and concerns of inefficacy 19 mean that this approach is controversial and will likely not be used unless a better alternative was unavailable. In the 1990s, Russian investigators had prepared hyperimmunized antisera from horses vaccinated with inactivated EBOV, which were shown to be effective when administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg to baboons, with 100% survival (2 survivors out of 2) when given 2 hours before challenge, and 67% (2 survivors out of 3) when given immediately after challenge 20 , although baboons are known to be more resistant to EBOV infection compared to other NHP species 21 . The survival benefits of the equine antisera were limited to a delay in the onset of viremia clinical symptoms when tested in cynomolgus macaques immediately after challenge, at a dose of 60 mg for an animal weighing between 5-6 kg 22 . Comparing to successful passive immunotherapy studies with purified IgG from NHPs (80 mg/kg), as well as ZMapp and MIL-77 (50 mg/kg), the dosage for the cynomolgus macaque experiment was likely too low at the time. Use of equine antisera as an emergency post-exposure treatment against EBOV has been approved in Russia, and several investigators that had been accidentally exposed to the virus have been administered this treatment, although it is not clear if they had actually been infected 23 .",

F(ab\u2032 ) 2 was developed in this study due to past documented issues with antisera administrations, in which equine botulinum toxin and anti-snake venom antisera was shown to produce serum sickness at high doses 24 . However, mice that were given a single dose of antisera demonstrated more complete protection over a greater period of time compared to multiple injections of F(ab\u2032 ) 2 . This suggests that F(ab\u2032 ) 2 has a shorter half-life compared to IgG (which has been confirmed in this study), and/or that virus neutralization plays a partial role in survival from EBOV. The observation that administering F(ab\u2032 ) 2 at 1 dpi is more efficacious than when the same treatment was given at 30 minutes post-exposure (Fig. 5A ) was also observed in past studies with therapeutic EBOV GP-specific monoclonal antibodies 25, 26 , and suggests that virus neutralization may play a bigger role in protection at a later timepoint after EBOV challenge. With regards to neutralization, past reports have shown that while elevated antisera levels in NHPs vaccinated against EBOV correlated with survival, levels of specific neutralizing antibodies did not 27 . It is a possible explanation as to why mAb KZ52, which was originally selected for its ability to neutralize EBOV 28 , failed to protect NHPs when given at a dose of 50 mg/kg starting 1 day before challenge 29 , and suggests that in the future, the screening of potentially efficacious antibodies against EBOV should not be based solely on the ability of the antibody to neutralize virus.",
