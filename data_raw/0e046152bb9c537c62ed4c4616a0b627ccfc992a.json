This treatment option has been shown to be effective against many diseases including anthrax [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and other biothreat agents [7, 8] . Several approaches have been used previously for the production of immunotherapeutics specific for B. anthracis although they all have significant drawbacks. The pooling of immune serum from previously vaccinated volunteers yields highly protective anti-sera in very small quantities, limiting its use as a source of therapeutics for the Strategic National Stockpile or as a commercially available product. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, limiting their application to a single antigenic target and have a high cost associated with their development further limiting their feasibility for mass production and stockpiling. In the past animal vaccination has successfully been used to generate immunotherapeutic antiserum specific for infectious and toxic agents including snake venom, botulism toxin and Ebola virus [9] [10] [11] [12] but limitations in quantity and safety have prevented their widespread use in the development of human therapeutics. Horses can provide large amounts of antiserum but are costly to maintain. Mice, rabbits and guinea pigs are inexpensive to maintain but yield limited volumes of anti-sera. Goats provide a renewable source of plasma and serum; however they have not been traditionally used in the generation of passive immunotherapeutics. We have plasmapheresed hyper immunized goats to successfully produce liters of GMP-grade antisera following a short immunization schedule (3 immunizations over 14 weeks), with minimal cost.",

            "text": "Bacillus anthracis produces two separate exotoxins, edema toxin (EdTx) and lethal toxin (LeTx). The two exotoxins utilize a common cell binding component termed protective antigen (PA83, 83 kDa) which binds to the ubiquitous anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) found on most cell surfaces. Once PA83 is bound to the host cell surface, a furin-like protease cleaves the full-length, inactive protein into the active form, PA63 (63 kDa), thereby exposing the binding sites for the catalytic components of the exotoxins (edema factor, EF or lethal factor, LF). A heptamer composed of PA63 + three LF/EF moieties [13, 14] forms on the cell surface and is internalized via receptor mediated endocytosis. The subsequent decrease in pH within the endosome causes conformational changes in PA63, so that it inserts into the endosomal membrane, forming a protease-stable pore; formation of this pore allows EF and LF to enter the cell and exert their toxic effects [15] . LeTx is formed when PA63 is combined with LF, and is responsible for the most severe intoxicative effects of anthrax infection. EF is an adenylate cyclase capable of causing severe disregulation of cellular cAMP levels [16] . LF has been shown to be a zinc-dependant metalloprotease with specificity for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) capable of disrupting several cell signaling cascades; however, its specific mode of action is still unclear [17, 18] . Disruption of the binding of PA to ATR or LF would disrupt internalization of functional LeTx and would thereby prevent toxin-mediated death of the host following rapid multiplication of the bacilli.",

Smaller animals are typically terminally bled in order to produce larger volumes of serum. Yields from a terminal bleed typically range from 0.5 ml for mice up to 200 ml for terminally bled rabbits. The large number of animals required to produce the therapeutic quantities needed for a useful medical countermeasure stockpile (e.g., the SNS) makes these animal models prohibitively expensive. Caprine plasmapheresis does not require the animals to be euthanized/terminally bled in order to generate large volumes of antisera. Additionally, the goats can be plasmapheresed up to four times per year for several years making for a nearly endless source of antisera. Plasmapheresis of three goats generated liters of anti-PA83 serum within a very short time frame. Additionally, the goats used to produce this material are part of a certified pathogen-free herd and the antisera produced are of GMP grade. Comparably produced IgG against HIV has been previously approved for clinical trials in humans [19] [20] [21] .",

            "text": "The previously approved AVA anthrax vaccine required a series of six immunizations followed by annual boosts. The use of a novel non-toxic MDP adjuvant enabled the generation of extremely high-titer antiserum following only two immunizations although for the current study, IgG was isolated from goats immunized four times. With further optimization of the immunization regiment, we may be able to generate an efficacious immunotherapeutic with fewer immunizations, thus shortening the production time and cost. It should also be emphasized that the data presented here used non-affinity-purified IgG or F(ab') 2 . Studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of the affinity purified materials, which may significantly reduce the amount of material required to offer significant protection in both animals and humans. F(ab') 2 antibodies have been used for the treatment of rattlesnake bites [28, 29] , bee stings [30] and evaluated for their potential to treat several infectious diseases including respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) [31] . Many monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been generated that are specific for the anthrax protective antigen. The majority of these MAbs do not demonstrate significant protection post-exposure and appear to require a blend of several MAbs in order to reduce the mortality associated with anthrax infections [32, 33] . A recent study using a monoclonal antibody against the anthrax protective antigen demonstrated a requirement for the Fc portion of the antibody in order to retain neutralizing capabilities [25] . Our polyclonal immunotherapeutic retained similar neutralizing levels both in vitro and in vivo after removal of the Fc region by pepsin In vivo protection against LeTx cytotoxicity Figure 3 In vivo protection against LeTx cytotoxicity. Percent survival of female Balb/c mice treated with 100 \u03bcg LeTx by i.p. injection followed 5 minutes later with 8 mg/kg anti-PA83 IgG or F(ab') 2 antibodies in 200 \u03bcl (5 per group). Control mice (Saline, 3 in group) received 100 \u03bcg LeTx followed by 200 \u03bcl Saline. All mice were observed twice daily for signs of illness or distress and all surviving mice were euthanized at day 11 post-challenge. P < 0.03 by the logrank test. digestion. These findings are consistent with data from other polyclonal antiserum, which indicate most F(ab') 2 retain comparable neutralizing and protective abilities to full length IgG [26, 29, 30, 34] . The utility of F(ab') 2 antisera derived from goats will reduce the potential for side-effects associated with patients who have a pre-existing sensitivity to goat proteins. In addition, patients requiring multiple treatments with an animal derived therapeutic may also be at increased risk of developing allergic hypersensitivity, so the use of F(ab') 2 antibody fragments will decrease this risk and increase the overall safety of this immunotherapeutic for multiple uses within a large population.",

Three goats immunized four times over a 56 day period produced liters of GMP grade, high titer antisera that was capable of neutralizing anthrax lethal toxin both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly the passive transfer of the goat-derived antibodies 24 h post-exposure to virulent anthrax spores provided mice with a substantial survival advantage over untreated mice. A synergistic effect was seen with concomitant antibiotic treatment although levels of protection returned to the levels observed with IgG treatment alone once antibiotic therapy was discontinued. This indicates that a combined treatment approach for patients presenting with clinical signs of anthrax infection could overall increase in survival rates associated with symptomatic disease. Additionally, this immunotherapeutic can be easily produced in quantities large enough to fulfill the requirements for a national medical countermeasures stockpile. The non-toxic MDP adjuvant developed is easily produced; amenable to covalent attachment of antigens, and importantly, renders toxins and pathogens inactive once coupled to the molecule. The use of this novel adjuvant should improve vaccine development and quality control in addition to eliciting significantly higher immune responses than standard adjuvants.",
