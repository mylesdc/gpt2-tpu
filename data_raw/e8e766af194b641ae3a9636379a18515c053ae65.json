PAM is characterized by accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IEs) that adhere to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space. We show here that human monoclonal IgG antibodies with specificity for variant surface antigens (VSA) specifically expressed by CSA-adhering IEs (VSA PAM ) can be used in vitro to select parasites from nonpregnant donors to express VSA PAM and that this selection for VSA PAM expression results in preferential transcription of var2csa.

Protection is mediated to a large extent by variant surface antigen (VSA)specific IgG. Nevertheless, women in such areas remain highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection if they become pregnant, as the parasites can switch to expression of particular VSA (called VSA PAM ), which allow infected erythrocyte (IE) sequestration in the placenta, but which are not compatible with parasite survival in a nonpregnant host. Acquired immunity to PAM is mediated by VSA PAMspecific IgG that either opsonizes IEs for phagocytosis or interferes with chondroitin sulphate A (CSA)-specific adhesion of IEs (1) . VAR2CSA, which is a member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of VSA, appears to be the dominant or only pregnancy-associated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (PAM) type VSA in the P. falciparum genome, and is therefore the main target of current efforts to develop a vaccine against PAM (2) . To assist this work, we have developed a panel of VSA PAM -specific human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (3) , which can opsonize VSA PAMexpressing IEs for phagocytosis and interfere with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al . unpublished data) . These antibodies can be used to enrich for VSA PAM expression in parasites not expressing VSA PAM but obtained from women with PAM (3) . In the present study we used two of the above-mentioned monoclonal antibodies to select for VSA PAM expression in parasites from nonpregnant donors. One antibody (PAM1\u00b74) was chosen because it appears to react with most or all parasites expressing VSA PAM . The other antibody (PAM8\u00b71) was chosen because it reacts with a well-defined, but inter-clonally variant, epitope in the DBL3X domain of VAR2CSA.",

VSA PAM is defined here as IE surface-expressed VSA, which are significantly better recognized by plasma IgG from P. falciparumexposed multigravidae than from sympatric men, and where the recognition by plasma IgG from these men is not significantly different from recognition by plasma IgG from nonexposed controls. In contrast, typical non-PAM VSAs are better recognized by plasma IgG from P. falciparumexposed adults than from nonexposed donors, without marked sex-dependent differences. Seven of the monoclonal antibodies used here are specific for inter-clonally variant epitopes in either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-\u03b5 domain of VAR2CSA (3) . The exact specificity of the last antibody (PAM1\u00b74) remains undefined, but it appears to recognize a conformational, and possibly discontinuous, epitope in VAR2CSA that is difficult to reproduce in recombinant constructs (3) . PAM1\u00b74 recognizes VSA PAM expressed by most or all P. falciparum genotypes, whereas the VAR2CSA DBL3-X epitope recognized by PAM8\u00b71 is present in some, but not all P. falciparum clones (3). Both PAM1\u00b74 and PAM8\u00b71 can opsonize VSA PAM -expressing IEs for phagocytosis and interfere with their adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation) .",

We used term plasma from 30 P. falciparum -exposed women (10 pregnant for the first time, 10 for the third time, and 10 for the fifth time) to assess parity-dependency, which requires a statistically significant relationship between IgG levels and number of pregnancies in P. falciparumexposed women (9) .

Furthermore, IE surface-reactive IgG levels did not depend on parity (Table 1 and Figure 1a ). Thus, unselected 3D7 and HB3 both showed typical non-PAM-type plasma antibody recognition patterns of IE surface-expressed VSA. This was confirmed by the nonreactivity of 3D7-and HB3-IEs with all eight VSA PAM -specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1d ). When VSA expression was re-assessed after three rounds of selection (about 6 weeks after the first round of selection), the recognition of 3D7-and HB3-IEs selected on either PAM1\u00b74 or PAM8\u00b71 all showed an indeterminate VSA phenotype, where one but not both criteria for sex-specific antibody recognition were met (Table 1 and Figure 1b ). PAM8\u00b71-selected 3D7 remained nonreactive with the four monoclonal antibodies used for testing at this time (PAM1\u00b74, PAM3\u00b710, PAM4\u00b77, and PAM8\u00b71), whereas the other three parasite lines showed reactivity with at least one of them (Figure 1e ). These results suggested that further rounds of selection might lead to definite VSA PAM expression, at least for PAM1\u00b74-selected 3D7, PAM1\u00b74-and PAM8\u00b71-selected HB3. Indeed, PAM1\u00b74-selected 3D7, as well as PAM1\u00b74-and PAM8\u00b71-selected HB3 had all acquired a typical sex-specific and parity dependent VSA PAM expression pattern after four additional rounds of selection (Table 1 and Figure 1c ), and reacted with all the monoclonal antibodies except the VAR2CSA DBL5-\u03b5 -specific PAM4\u00b77 (Figure 1f ). In contrast, 3D7 selected seven times for reactivity with PAM8\u00b71 retained an indeterminate sex-specificity pattern also seen after three rounds of selection, did not acquire the parity-dependent pattern typical of VSA PAMexpressing lines (Table 1) , and did not react with any of the eight VSA PAM -specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1f ). Thus, PAM8\u00b71 could not be used to select 3D7 for VSA PAM reactivity, consistent with the absence of the predicted epitope for this antibody in the VAR2CSA DBL3-X domain of this parasite (3).",

We used monoclonal human IgG antibodies to select erythrocytes infected by two genotypically distinct laboratory P. falciparum clones derived from nonpregnant donors for expression of VSA PAM .

It has been speculated that switching to VSA PAM expression requires signals from the pregnant host, for example hormones, and that selection therefore might not be possible unless the parasite is derived from such a host. It has also been argued that selection of parasites by panning on CSA in vitro might result in expression of antigens of dubious relevance to the antigens expressed as a result of in vivo selection occurring in the pregnant woman. Our data show that switching to expression of genuine VSA PAM can occur in vitro in the absence of external signals, in line with other recent evidence (18) . By extension, these findings suggest that switching to VSA PAM in vivo also occurs spontaneously regardless of the pregnancy status of the host. In a pregnant host, such parasites will often be at a selective advantage (because of the frequent absence of VSA PAM -specific immunity in women of low parity) (19) , whereas they appear to be unable to survive in a nonpregnant host (20) .",

            "text": "Third, our results support the hypothesis that although interclonal variation in VAR2CSA is the result of antibodydriven positive selection, the diversity of functionally important antibody epitopes in the molecule is constrained (21) . Thus, some parasites can express VAR2CSA without being vulnerable to recognition by certain VAR2CSAreactive antibodies, because of variation in defined parts of VAR2CSA. The persistent nonrecognition by PAM8\u00b71 of VAR2CSA-expressing 3D7 is a case in point. At the same time, the PAM8\u00b71 antibody, originally identified by its reactivity with VSA PAM -expressing FCR3-IEs (3), was effectively selected for VSA PAM expression in the genetically unrelated HB3 clone. The significance of these findings is underscored by the fact that PAM8\u00b71 efficiently opsonizes IEs for phagocytosis as well as interferes with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation) . Our study also corroborates existing evidence that PAM1\u00b74 recognizes most if not all VSA PAM -expressing parasites by recognizing a functionally highly constrained and conformation-dependent discontinuous epitope in VAR2CSA (3). Like PAM8\u00b71, PAM1\u00b74 is an opsonin and capable of interfering with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation) . Therefore, the PAM1\u00b74 epitope is a highly attractive candidate for development of a PAM-specific vaccine, and its characterization is a matter of the highest priority in our current research. Although the theoretical possibility of another, non-PfEMP1 target of PAM1\u00b74 remains, available evidence point to VAR2CSA.",
