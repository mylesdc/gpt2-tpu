The MOHP has additionally conducted an annual survey among pilgrims returning from Hajj to explore the risk of influenza virus transmission to the broader community. Following the emergence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, the MOHP expanded the survey to test for MERS-CoV.",

Findings from this study may additionally be biased by the non-random selection of participants and recall bias.While MERS-CoV was not detected in any respiratory swabs or sputum specimens collected from participants, no information regarding health care or camel exposure was collected, limiting the interpre-tation of these results. In future iterations, the MOHP could consider adding exposure questions to better understand the risk of MERS-CoV infection among Egyptians on Hajj. Additionally, upper respiratory tract specimens have been shown to yield significantly lower MERS-CoV genome loads than lower respiratory tract specimens (such as tracheal aspirates), which may have limited our ability to detect MERS-CoV. 14 Despite the MOHP's requirement of influenza vaccination for all Egyptian Hajj pilgrims, only 19.7% of participants reported receiving seasonal influenza vaccine prior to their pilgrimage. This figure may underestimate true influenza vaccine coverage, as interviewers only asked about vaccines received as part of Hajj travel preparations. Nevertheless, further health education through local media may help raise awareness about the value of influenza vaccination prior to departure for Hajj, especially among older age groups at high risk of influenza complications. 15 An evaluation of the MOHP's current risk communication campaigns to increase influenza vaccination use among pilgrims may help identify strategies to improve influenza vaccine coverage.",
