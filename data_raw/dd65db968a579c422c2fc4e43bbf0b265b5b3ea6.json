PDCoV is a highly contagious infectious disease characterized by diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting. It has been reported that lncRNA has a significant effect on viral replication and increased or decreased virulence. At present, there is almost no research on lncRNA related to PDCoV infection. With the development of the research, a large number of lncRNAs related to PDCoV infection have been discovered. Identifying the role of these lncRNAs in the infection process facilitates the screening of diagnostically significant biomarkers.",

This causes villus atrophy resulting in diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and weight loss. Our results from target mRNA pathway analysis revealed that pre-challenge target mRNAs of lncRNA were enriched for the signaling pathway of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, limonene and pinene degradation, chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation as well as glycolysis / gluconeogenesis. During the middle stages of infection, limonene and pinene degradation, glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, histidine metabolism signaling pathway were prominent and late-stage target mRNAs were primarily concentrated on histidine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, beta-Alanine metabolism. It can be seen that some differentially expressed lncRNAs are related to the metabolism of organisms. The GO analysis indicated that at the middle stage of infection, these target genes were significantly enriched in the biological process category including regulation of activated T cell proliferation. Our future work will include determining lncRNA mechanisms of T cell activation and proliferation. This will assist in determining how the immune system is compromised by PDCoV infection in pigs.",

Interestingly, both lncRNA and mRNA in the ceRNA network were negatively correlated with miRNA. Previous studies have confirmed that ceRNAs can act as miRNA 'sponges' and this is especially important for cancer and tumor diseases [27, 28] . By analyzing the miRNAs in the ceRNA network we found that the target miRNAs ssc-miR-885-5p, ssc-miR-490-5p, ssc-miR-196b-5p and ssc-miR-133b of lncRNAs were all up regulated. MiR-885-5p is a direct regulator of the IGF1 receptor that in combination with p73 regulate emergence of aggressive cancer stem-like features [29] . Decreased expression of miR-133b is associated with poor survival and increased metastasis in colorectal cancer [30] . miR-490-5p inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion but miR-490-5p can promote apoptosis of Human hepatoma (Hep3B) cells by inhibiting Roundabout Guidance Receptor 1 (ROBO1) [31] . MiR-196b-5p overexpression may also be associated with a risk of conversion of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [32] . The target miRNAs ssc-miR-194b-3p, ssc-miR-184, ssc-miR-215, ssc-miR-874 were all down regulated. miR-874 and miR-215 can act as a tumor suppressor [33, 34] .

The ceRNA network was generated from the interaction network and used Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to calculate the correlation between mRNA and lncRNA and chose pairs with positive correlations (PCC > 0.99 and P < 0.05). Visualization of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape software (version 3.0; http:// www.cytoscape.org/download.php). ) were randomly selected from the middle of the infection for real-time qRT-PCR validation, with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used as an endogenous control. Total RNA was extracted from uninfected and infected cells using a total RNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, USA) with 2 \u03bcg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers were designed using Primer 5.0 software www.premierbiosoft. com (Table 2) . One-step real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using a One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara) on an ABI PRISM 7500 instrument. The following steps were used: reverse transcription at 42\u00b0C for 10 min, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 10 s and finally a melting curve. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. LncRNA expression levels were calculated based on the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method [37] . Expression levels were normalized to those of GAPDH.",
