About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country's engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies. Methods: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion. Results: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis. Discussion: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.",

Therefore, having a mutually agreed and prioritized agenda among key sectors is crucial for resource allocation and strengthening zoonotic disease surveillance systems in the country. Ethiopia's Growth and Transformation Plan, developed under the guidance of the United Nations, intends to further increase the livestock population and maximize their productivity. This requires a parallel national strategy to prevent and control the most significant zoonotic diseases, which is also a component of the Global Health Securities Agenda (GHSA). GHSA is an initiative developed by the US government with other international collaborators to address the gaps that exist in many countries in meeting the International Health Regulations and the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) pathway. GHSA has three strategies -Predict, Respond, and Preventand eleven packages were developed to achieve the strategies [11] . One of these action packages is addressing the burden of zoonotic diseases. Because a large number of zoonotic diseases endemically occur in Ethiopia, a prioritization process was necessary to identify the most critical zoonotic diseases that should be jointly addressed by animal and human health agencies to maximize impact on the health of people and animals in Ethiopia. The present article describes the first semi-quantitative, multi-sectoral process used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia.",

Although multiple agencies were invited to participate in the workshop, key decisions including selection of criteria, questions to address the criteria, and the final selection of top five zoonotic diseases was made by five pre-selected committee members.

Effective implementation of prevention and control strategies for the prioritized zoonotic diseases requires sustained collaboration among both the animal and human health sectors. To facilitate this, the workshop participants recommended the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit, which would include staff from EPHI and MoLFR or other appropriate animal health agencies. The proposed unit would develop a national zoonotic disease strategy and coordinate efforts between the human and animal health sectors to jointly address the selected zoonotic diseases and respond to outbreaks in people and animals. Such a unit would enhance inter-sectoral linkages, facilitate efficient utilization of scarce resources, and capitalize on various sectors' capabilities to improve prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. Similar collaborative units created in other East African countries such as Kenya and Tanzania have helped to advance zoonotic disease prevention and control activities (unpublished data).",

The lack of data highlights potential areas for future collaboration and demonstrates the need for enhanced surveillance to improve our knowledge of both the presence and the degree of impact of zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia. Additionally, committee members were identified by the workshop organizers, therefore, there was the potential for selection bias.
