            "text": "Background: Syndromic surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is important to assess seriousness of disease as recommended by WHO for influenza. In 2015 the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) started to collaborate with a private hospital network to develop a SARI surveillance system using case-based data on ICD-10 codes. This first-time description of the system shows its application to the analysis of five influenza seasons. Methods: Since week 40/2015, weekly updated anonymized data on discharged patients overall and on patients with respiratory illness including ICD-10 codes of primary and secondary diagnoses are transferred from the network data center to RKI. Retrospective datasets were also provided. Our descriptive analysis is based on data of 47 sentinel hospitals collected between weeks 1/2012 to 20/2016. We applied three different SARI case definitions (CD) based on ICD-10 codes for discharge diagnoses of respiratory tract infections (J09 -J22): basic CD (BCD), using only primary diagnoses; sensitive CD (SCD), using primary and secondary diagnoses; timely CD (TCD), using only primary diagnoses of patients hospitalized up to one week. We compared the CD with regard to severity, age distribution and timeliness and with results from the national primary care sentinel system. Results: The 47 sentinel hospitals covered 3.6% of patients discharged from all German hospitals in 2013. The SCD comprised 2.2 times patients as the BCD, and 3.6 times as many as the TCD. Time course of SARI cases corresponded well to results from primary care surveillance and influenza virus circulation. The patients fulfilling the TCD had been completely reported after 3 weeks, which was fastest among the CD. The proportion of SARI cases among patients was highest in the youngest age group of below 5-year-olds. However, the age group 60 years and above contributed most SARI cases. This was irrespective of the CD used. Conclusions: In general, available data and the implemented reporting system are appropriate to provide timely and reliable information on SARI in inpatients in Germany. Our ICD-10-based approach proved to be useful for fulfilling requirements for SARI surveillance. The exploratory approach gave valuable insights in data structure and emphasized the advantages of different CD.",

In the course of the pandemic three ad hoc systems were established to capture severe respiratory cases. The first was the Pandemic Hospital Based Surveillance (Pandemische Influenza Krankenhaus-Surveillance (PIKS)) that was implemented by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) to collect data on hospital admissions diagnosed with laboratory confirmed influenza [9] . The second was a SARI-Surveillance study that was part of a hospital-based pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness study [10] . Lastly, there was enhanced surveillance of influenza during the pandemic with systematic collection of additional variables supplementary to the national regular mandatory notifications of laboratory confirmed influenza cases. For the mandatory system, it was only possible to record information on severity and risk factors according the WHO recommendations as long as the pandemic was under the scope of the Public Health Emergency of international Concern (PHEIC [11] ) and an additional national pandemic notification ordinance was in force [12] . Although the information gathered on severe influenza cases and risk factors for severe course of disease were not only important in the national context but also used for global analyses [13] , none of the three approaches were continued on a routine basis. Thus, the aim to establish a sustainable, timely and cost-efficient approach that could collect data during seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics remained a priority.",

This used case-based data coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) [18] and additional information on relevant procedures such as ventilation. A similar approach was used previously in the German primary care syndromic sentinel system to integrate case based ICD-10 coded reports.

For the analysis in this paper we only included data from the 47 hospital sites for which we had annual data for every year in the period of week 1/2012-20/2016 in order to illustrate the characteristics of our data over five consecutive influenza seasons. This was last updated on 27 June 2016. The number of patients covered by the sentinel sites were compared to nationwide data from the federal statistical office of Germany regarding the number of hospitals and the number of hospitalized patients in the years 2013 and 2014 [22, 23] . In the pilot phase several case definitions for SARI syndrome based on combinations of ICD-10 J-codes [18] in discharge diagnoses were selected after a literature research (Appendix, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ) and tested with regard to their sensitivity for surveillance purposes (Fig. 1) . Our dataset includes patients with any primary and secondary ICD-10 diagnosis code from J00 to J99. Thus, combinations of ICD-10 codes containing codes from other chapters are not feasible (Appendix, [25, 27] ). As the focus in syndromic influenza surveillance is on acute respiratory diseases, we restricted probable cases to ICD-10 diagnosis codes from J00 to J22 and excluded ICD-10 codes from J40 to J47, as they are used for chronic lower respiratory diseases (Appendix, [24] ). We described the occurrence of the ICD-10 diagnosis groups J00 -J06 (acute upper respiratory infections), J09 -J18 (influenza and pneumonia) and J20-22 (other acute lower respiratory infections) in the sentinel data and the age distributions within the diagnosis groups. We defined five age groups according to the outpatient sentinel system (AGI) [5, 6] , which were 0-4 years, 5-14 years, 35-59 years and 60 years or older.",

This disadvantage cannot be adjusted by an additional inclusion of patients with secondary diagnosis J09 to J11 (data not shown). As there are no specific recommendations for influenza diagnostic in Germany, it is up to the attending physician to decide if a patient with acute respiratory symptoms will be tested for influenza. By using only ICD-10 codes J09-11 the overwhelming proportion of influenza and influenza-related illness of the lower respiratory tract will be missed due to testing bias.

But using only primary diagnoses captures mainly the population without major comorbidities. Therefore, a more sensitive case definition (SCD) was found to be more appropriate in terms of estimating disease burden. SARI patients with an underlying chronic disease such as heart disease or chronic respiratory disease may have their comorbidity coded in the primary diagnosis and the acute respiratory disease in their secondary diagnosis, as the aggravation of the chronic disease could play a major role in their hospitalization [30] . This means that an after-season assessment of severity and burden could be used to compare BCD and SCD in order to provide additional information on the populations most affected. The SCD is not suitable for in-season surveillance of SARI activity, as patients with underlying diseases tend to have a more extended stays in hospital and their data is available later than data of patients with no or only minor illnesses apart from their acute respiratory disease. The subset of SARI patients fulfilling the BCD with a length of stay <8 days i.e. meeting the timely case definition (TCD) were used to assess the trend of acute respiratory activity. The TCD data lags two weeks behind the information from primary care sentinal surveillance (AGI), but still allows a timely situation assessment within the season.",

Based on the five seasons analyzed we were able to create a SARI baseline as a starting point for evaluation of severity of future influenza epidemics or pandemics. At the same time, the newly established system will allow an even more detailed analysis focusing on different subgroups of patients with specific risk factors and underlying conditions.
