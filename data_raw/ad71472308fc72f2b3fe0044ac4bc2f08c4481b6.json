            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is a devastating, fatal disease of domestic cats caused by a pathogenic mutant virus derived from the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Infection by FECV is generally subclinical, and little is known about the mucosal immune response that controls and eliminates the virus. We investigated the mucosal immune response against FECV in an endemically infected breeding colony over a seven-month period. Thirty-three cats were grouped according to FECV seropositivity and fecal virus shedding into na\u00efve/immunologically quiescent, convalescent and actively infected groups. Blood, fecal samples and colon biopsies were collected to assess the mucosal and systemic immunologic and virologic profile. Results showed that cats with active FECV infections have strong systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses that wane after virus clearance. Significant FECV-specific mucosal T cell IFN\u03b3 responses were not detected in any of the three groups. A shift toward an inflammatory state in the mucosa was suggested by increased IL17:FoxP3 expression. However, no histologic abnormalities were observed, and no shifts in lymphocyte subpopulation phenotype or proliferation were noted. Together, the results suggest that control of FECV is mediated by humoral mucosal and systemic responses and that perturbations in the primary reservoir organ (colon) are minimal.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis remains intractable with regard to diagnosis, treatment and prevention (reviewed in [1, 2] ). It is generally accepted that feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) emerges in individual cats due to the mutation of replicating feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [2] . FECV is mucosally transmitted, replicates to the greatest levels in the intestinal tract, and most commonly persists in the colonic epithelium [3, 4] . While some cats are able to control FECV replication and eliminate the infection, others remain infected and are intermittent or persistent virus shedders [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, immunity to FECV is not life-long, so reinfection can occur, with FECV continually churning in cat populations, particularly within shelters or breeding colonies through cycles of repeated exposure, infection, and shedding. Within FECV-infected cats, the combination of high virus replication and high error rate in RNA replication results in innumerable mutations. If a mutation occurs that allows the virus to escape immune surveillance and efficiently infect and replicate in monocytes, it can then systemically spread, and fatal FIP may occur [2] . Vaccine strategies have targeted the mutant FIPV, but this approach has been ineffective and, in some cases, has resulted in accelerated disease as a result of the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (reviewed in [2, 8] ).",

Excellent epidemiologic studies have characterized the shedding and transmission of FECV within populations. FECV circulates within cat populations and is epidemiologically characterized by repeated infections, persistent shedding, and carrier states [3, 5, 6] . FECV is highly contagious, as shown by Pedersen et al. where 28/50 (56%) FECV-negative cats were infected within one week after introduction to an animal shelter [9] . In addition, at the time of entering the shelter, 33% of cats were already shedding FECV, and their level of shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold during the first week, which was likely secondary to the stress associated with shelter admission. The high incidence of infection combined with massive virus replication greatly enhances the likelihood that a mutant virus will emerge.",

Here, we studied a colony of 33 co-housed cats with endemic FECV for seven months. Blood, feces and colon biopsies were collected to establish the relationship between virus control and the mucosal and systemic immune response. Results showed that mucosal IgA and systemic IgG are associated with a clearance of virus infection, while no cell-mediated immune response was detected. The humoral response waned rapidly after the virus was cleared, and only minimal structural or functional perturbations could be demonstrated in the colon. These results suggest that the control of FECV at the intestinal mucosa might be achievable by a vaccine-induced humoral response with the goal of disrupting the endemic persistence of FECV in cat populations to reduce the chance of FIPV emergence in individuals.",

The colony was known to have circulating feline coronavirus (FCoV) based on seropositivity and the sporadic occurrence of FIP since the establishment of the colony in the 1980s. The genome of the circulating virus was sequenced and shown to be serotype 1. Cats were the offspring of colony matings, queens were individually housed prior to parturition, and offspring were introduced into the colony when they reached breeding age. Cats were group housed, with the exception of intact males, which were housed together in their own run in the same room as the other cats.",

Group 1 cats (N = 18; average age, 3.1 yrs.; range, 2.2-6.5 yrs) were FCoV seronegative and virus negative throughout the study, but given that these cats were gang housed, they were most likely exposed to FCoV and possibly infected at some point prior to the study period. Group 2 cats (N = 6; average age, 5.1 yrs.; range, 4.2-5.8 yrs) were seropositive at the time of colonoscopy but never tested positive for fecal or tissue (colon biopsy or blood) virus. Group 3 cats (N = 9; average age, 3.8 yrs.; range, 2.0-6.6 yrs) were seropositive and were also fecal virus positive at timepoint \u22122 and/or 0 months. Eight of the nine Group 3 cats controlled virus shedding within three months from the start of the study. The cat with uncontrolled virus shedding remained fecal virus positive throughout the study period, and its colon biopsy was also virus positive. The serological status and RT-PCR results for each group are shown in Table 1 . These groups were anticipated to represent different immunological states that might identify correlates of protection against FECV. Group 1 cats represented an immune na\u00efve or immune quiescent state, while Group 2 cats represented the convalescent phase of the immune response. It was fortuitous to collect colon biopsies on eight cats in Group 3 very near the time that virus replication was controlled, as this presumably provided a snapshot of a successful mucosal immune response to the virus. The average time of observed virus shedding in cats that ultimately controlled virus replication was 2.6 months, and the average time of seropositivity after virus replication was controlled was 2.5 months. These data reveal less about the virus infection kinetics, since this was a study of naturally infected cats, and the actual time of infection was not known. More can be concluded about the systemic immune response, which waned rapidly after virus was cleared. Of the cats that were seropositive at the time of colon biopsy (Groups 2 and 3), 11 of the 15 were seronegative by the end of the study. ",

Since the colon is the primary reservoir and site of replication for FECV, colon biopsies were both logical and convenient for mucosal immune response evaluation [3, 4] . The distribution of enrolled cats, based on the combination of serological and fecal virus status, was similar to previous reports and allowed for a direct comparison of na\u00efve/immune quiescent, convalescent, and actively infected cats [28] . Fortuitously, eight of the nine cats positive for fecal virus shedding controlled replication at or shortly after colonic biopsy. Thus, the immune profile observed in the tissue might provide correlates of protection against FECV. These cats had significantly elevated mucosal IgA along with systemic IgG against FCoV, but they had no measurable mucosal IFN\u03b3 T cell response. Based on these results, it appears that FECV control is mediated by antibody responses.",

This suggests that secretory IgA (SIgA) may play a key role in preventing immunopathogenesis in FECV infections. SIgA is the most abundantly produced antibody isotype in the body and is highly resistant to proteolysis, engendering stability in the harsh environment of the intestinal tract [29] . SIgA is mucophilic and accumulates at greater concentration in the mucus layer covering the intestinal epithelium; therefore, it stands as the first adaptive immune defense against mucosal pathogens [30] . The effector functions of SIgA include virus neutralization and immune exclusion in the intestinal lumen. The intracellular inactivation of viruses and the removal of antigens from the lamina propria by IgA has also been demonstrated (reviewed in [31] ). Additionally, in contrast to IgG, IgA does not activate complement, and this prevents inflammation and tissue damage during infections (reviewed in [32] ). Though further studies are needed, a general lack of immune activation (as was measured in this study) combined with the effective control of viral replication suggests a key role for SIgA in subclinical FECV infection.",

We observed no abnormalities in the serum chemistry profile or CBC of Group 3 cats. Likewise, no cell-associated virus was detected in the blood, even though systemic dissemination during FECV infection has been well described [3] . It may be that we missed the window of viremia in these cats that were on the verge of controlling replication in the gastrointestinal tract [33] . Similarly, no FCoV antigen was demonstrated in the colonic biopsies and only three of the nine cats were positive for viral RNA in the biopsy tissue. This also suggests a waning infection and perhaps a low sensitivity of the assays given the very small amount of tissue (a single 2 mm biopsy) that was available for analysis. No differences were noted in mucosal lymphocyte phenotype percentages or proliferation between groups of cats, and this was consistent with a lack of inflammation on histology. Colonic inflammation can be multifocal, and it is possible that the colonic biopsies evaluated were not representative of the inflammatory state elsewhere in the colon. These features confirm the overall picture of a relatively benign enteric viral infection despite robust viral replication.",

No differences were observed between groups, suggesting cellular sources of IFN\u03b3 including NK cells, NKT cells and T cells were not over-represented in the colonic mucosa of FECV-shedding cats. Furthermore, the lack of difference when cells were stimulated with FCoV antigen suggests a lack of a cytotoxic T cell adaptive response. The small number of colonic lymphocytes available for immunophenotyping limited the analysis, but the relatively low number of CD8+ cells was surprising. We previously reported the phenotype of intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes (IEL and LPL, respectively) in the small intestine of cats [12] . While small intestine IEL were predominantly CD8+, the majority of LPL were CD4+ T cells. The method used here harvested IEL and LPL together and the phenotype of colonic lymphocytes has not been previously reported in cats. In mice and humans, CD4+ T cells predominate in the IEL and LPL of the colon [24] . Despite this dominance of CD4+ over CD8+ T cells in mice and humans, the very low percentage of CD8+ T cells in the colonic mucosa of cats (<5%) seems unusual. It could be an artifact of tissue processing or antibody selection; however, we used methods and reagents previously validated for the analysis of lymphocytes in the small intestine [12] . Further work is required to confirm these results and to functionally characterize feline colonic lymphocytes.",

There are many caveats to this approach as a proxy for the evaluation of Th17 and regulatory T cells (Treg), but the small tissue sample size and lack of feline-specific reagents to identify Th17 at the start of the study limited the options. Interestingly, a cross-reactive IL17A antibody has recently been reported and was used to assess FIP-associated uveitis [34] .

A rapid decline in antibody titer after the control of FECV replication has been commonly observed [5] [6] [7] and was the case with the cats in this study. The lack of durability of the presumptive protective antibody response underlies the potential for repeated reinfection but also represents a challenge for the development of an FCoV vaccine. A host-pathogen balance exists between cats and FCoV such that the virus is rarely pathogenic. The mild infection does not elicit life-long immunity, thereby allowing a perpetual endemic state in cat populations with the occasional emergence of highly pathogenic FIPV. Successful immunization against FCoV will likely require induction of a robust T cell response to drive the establishment of B cell memory and longer-living plasma cells while also creating a cell-mediated immune safety net in the event of FIPV emergence [40] .",

An orally delivered vaccine targeting protective FCoV epitopes may provide protection, particularly in the high-density and stressful environments associated with shelters and colonies. To be successful, such a vaccine would have to avoid the pitfalls of antibody-dependent enhancement that is associated with anti-spike protein IgG.
