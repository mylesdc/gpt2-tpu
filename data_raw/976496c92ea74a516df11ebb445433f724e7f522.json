The impact of the physical deletion of M2-2 on hMPV replication, and genetic stability in tissue culture were evaluated. rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 exhibited somewhat restricted replication in Vero cells, but was significantly attenuated in hamsters. Hamsters immunized with rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 were protected from experimental challenge with wthMPV/NL/1/00. The deletion of M2-2 resulted in higher levels of viral mRNA transcripts in tissue culture, giving rise to aberrant ratios of genomic RNA to viral transcripts. In addition, previously unreported genetic instability was observed, resulting in a higher frequency of point mutations and random insertions of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 genomic RNA.",

To further assess the genetic stability of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2, one-step RT-PCR was performed on a virus stock that was serially passaged 4 times in Vero cells. Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR product spanning the M2 and SH genes (nt4536 to nt6205) revealed nucleotide polymorphisms in several poly A tracts (sense direction) in the M2-1 and SH genes. Figure  3A shows a representative chromatogram of the sequence of an RT-PCR product generated from a rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 virus stock. The wild-type sequence AGAGAAACTGA 6 TT is shown overlapping another sequence containing an inserted A in the poly A 6 tract. Three independently derived virus stocks of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 had major subpopulations with inserted A nucleotides (nts) at nt5060, nt5166 or nt5222 in M2-1, each of which would cause a premature translation termination in the M2-1 ORF. (See figure 3D for numbering of A insertions). Subpopulations with inserted A's were also detected at nt5551 or nt5572 in SH that would result in premature translation termination in the SH ORF.",

For rhMPV/ \u0394M2-2, 14 of 15 cloned RT-PCR sequences exhibited a total of 79 transition mutations, 2 transversions, and 1 deletion. Only 1 cloned sequence from rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 had no nucleotide changes. In comparison, 7 of 15 cloned RT-PCR products of rhMPV showed a total of 17 transitions, 2 transversions, and 1 deletion.

            "text": "To further investigate the role of hMPV M2-2, we compared the transcription and genome replication of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 with rhMPV in Vero cells. First, we compared the amounts of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 viral transcripts with that of rhMPV by Northern blotting. Northern blot analysis was performed using hMPV-specific anti-sense DIGlabeled riboprobes to detect M2, SH, N, F, or G mRNA. At 24-hr intervals, RNA was extracted from Vero cells inoculated with rhMPV or rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 at an MOI of 0.1, and Northern blot analysis was performed in 6 replicates. The M2 and SH riboprobes each detected two RNA species from rhMPV-infected cells (Lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 of Figure  5A and 5B). The size of the minor species is consistent with the monocistronic transcript while the size of the major species coincided with the predicted size of the M2/ SH read-through product. No monocistronic M2 transcripts were observed at 24 or 48 hours post rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 infection in Vero cells. The predicted M2/SH readthrough product showed a reduction in size in rhMPV/ \u0394M2-2 infected cells consistent with the deletion of M2-2 (compare lanes 1 and 2 of Figure 5A ). The levels of bicistronic compared to monocistronic SH transcripts were higher in both rhMPV and rhMVP/\u0394M2-2 infected cells, but the difference was more pronounced in rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 infected cells ( Figure 5B ). This increased level of readthrough was unexpected since we had sought to preserve the native M2/SH noncoding sequences. One explanation could be that transcription termination at the M2 gene end sequences required nucleotides in the coding region of M2-2 that had been inadvertently removed and/or the M2 termination signal was altered by the introduction of the Swa I site. Next we compared the amounts of M2 transcripts in cells infected with rhMPV or rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 at days 1 to 4 postinfection (p.i.). At day 1 p.i., the levels of transcripts were equivalent between both viruses (lanes 1 and 2 in Figure  5A ). By day 2 p.i., the relative levels had changed markedly. The amount of transcripts in cells infected with rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 was several-fold higher compared to cells infected with rhMPV (lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 5A ). The upregulation was maintained up to day 4, when peak titers were observed (lanes 7 and 8 in Figure 5 ). More SH, N, F, and G transcripts were also observed in cells infected with rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 compared to rhMPV ( Figure 5B ,C,D and 5E). Therefore, M2-2 deletion resulted in up-regulation of viral transcripts of genes upstream (N, F) and downstream (SH, G) of the M2 gene. However, the increased levels of viral transcripts produced by the rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 mutant were not accompanied by an increase in virus titer. On days 2 and 3, rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 had higher levels of transcripts but equivalent or lower titers compared to rhMPV ( Figure 5H) . Neither was there a concomitant increase in protein expression, at least for the F gene ( Figure 4B , lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the higher levels of viral transcripts produced by the M2-2 deletion mutant did not yield a greater number of infectious rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 virions compared to rhMPV. We noted that the levels of rhMPV transcripts peaked at day 3 (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 in Figure 5 ), while the levels of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 transcripts remained the same on days 3 and 4 (lanes 6 and 8 of Figure 5 ).",

These results agree with a similar study reported by Buchholz et al. in which a different subtype A hMPV strain, CAN97-83, with a deletion of M2-2 was proposed as a potential vaccine candidate [14, 15] . Our studies utilized the rhMPV/NL/1/00/E93K/S101P backbone which contained engineered mutations in the hMPV F gene that allows this virus to replicate efficiently in Vero cells without trypsin supplementation [17] . This property is expected to facilitate the testing and manufacture of potential live hMPV vaccine candidates. To assess the genetic stability of our M2-2 deletion mutant, sequence analyses were performed on P4 stocks of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2. These analyses revealed major subpopulations (as high as 50%) that contained insertions of A nucleotides (sense direction) in the M2-1 and SH ORFs. These insertions appeared predominantly in A tracts and were also observed in non-hMPV sequences. Nucleotide insertions were also readily detected in an A tract introduced in the GFP ORF. Interestingly, insertions of A were not observed outside the region encompassing the nonessential genes M2 and SH. Transcriptional editing, whereby alternative reading frames of viral genes are accessed, has been observed in the P gene of several paramyxoviruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Therefore it is possible that an inserted A could occur frequently during transcriptional editing of paramyxovirus RNA. The nucleotide insertions observed in rhMPV M2-2 deletion mutants differ somewhat from transcriptional editing in that (i) the positions of inserted A nucleotides did not appear to be sequence biased beyond selecting for A tracts and is not hMPV sequence specific, and (ii) the nucleotide insertions were incorporated into the viral genome and could be propagated, as shown by passaging of fluorescent rhMPV/\u0394M2-2/GFPpolyA viruses. Interestingly, these insertions did not appear to confer growth advantages in Vero cells because further passaging of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 promoted new A insertions and did not increase the subpopulations of earlier insertions. Many of the A nucleotide insertions caused premature translation terminations in the non-essential M2-1 and/or SH ORFs. These observations argue mechanistically against transcriptional editing and suggest that the insertions observed when M2-2 was deleted may be caused by an alteration in the fidelity of the replication complex directly or indirectly.",

This had been observed previously for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) M2-2 gene as well as for hMPV [14] . Deletion of RSV M2-2 resulted in higher levels of viral transcripts compared to wt RSV. Based on these observations it was postulated that the RSV M2-2 is involved in regulating the balance between transcription and genome replication [24, 25] . Our observation that the levels of rhMPV transcripts peaked at day 3 p.i., while the levels of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 transcripts remained high through day 4 p.i. is also consistent with a higher level of viral transcripts in rhMPV/ \u0394M2-2 infected cells.

In RNA from cells infected with rhMPV, the M2 riboprobes detected a minor monocistronic M2 transcript and a major polycistronic M2/SH readthrough transcript. While transcription readthrough is not unique to the M2/SH intergenic region, the polycistronic readthrough transcripts at other noncoding regions such as N/P and F/M2 were less pronounced and monocistronic transcripts predominated. The genes immediately upstream and downstream of the M2 and SH transcription units also existed predominantly as monocistronic transcripts indicating that the M2 gene-end sequences are particularly prone to high frequency of readthrough transcription. The frequency of readthrough transcription at the M2 gene stop sequences appeared to be accentuated by the removal of the M2-2 ORF. This may in part be attributed to the sequences that were removed and/or altered by the introduction of a Swa I site at the proximity of the M2 gene end sequences. Nonetheless, the increased frequency of readthrough at this gene junction may perturb the expression of downstream genes such as SH, G and L. In rhMPV/ \u0394M2-2 infected cells, there are major populations of M2-1 transcripts that contained premature termination codons introduced by the high point mutation frequency. Therefore, it is possible that M2-1 expression was significantly reduced during rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 infection and this reduction in M2-1 expression may also contribute to the up-regulation of transcription and increased frequency of read-through observed.",

Growth of recombinant r\u0394M2-2 CAN97-83 is trypsin-dependent and peak titer was not observed until 11 days post infection [14] . In contrast, our rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 achieved peak titers at 4 days post-infection, a significant savings in production time. Interestingly, both \u0394M2-2 viruses showed dramatic up-regulation of transcription at 48 hours post infection despite very different growth kinetics. No increase in the frequency of read-through transcription was observed for r\u0394M2-2 CAN97-83 whereas we observed increased polycistronic M2/SH transcripts in rhMPV/ \u0394M2-2 infected cells. This may stem from differences in the construction of the M2-2 deletion. r\u0394M2-2CAN97-83 had a deletion of 152 nt in the M2-2 ORF whereas our construct had a deletion of 142 nt and a SwaI site introduced adjacent to the polyA tract of the M2 gene stop sequences. However, the ratio of polycistronic M2/SH transcripts to monocistronic M2 transcripts was significantly different even between the two wild-type hMPV strains, with the Netherlands strain exhibiting a higher frequency of readthrough at the M2/SH noncoding region than the Canadian strain.",
