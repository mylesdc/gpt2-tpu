Eighteen (75%) patients had received chemotherapy in the previous month, and 14 were neutropenic at the onset of influenza. A total of 10 patients were evaluated for their duration of viral shedding, and 5 (50%) displayed prolonged viral shedding (median 23, range = 11-63 days); however, this was not associated with the emergence of a resistant H1N1pdm virus.

However, an analysis of the impact of this novel virus in a highly susceptible population, such as cancer patients, through clinical and virological perspectives, needs to be highlighted [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . The atypical clinical presentation of influenza infections in cancer patients, which delays clinical suspicion, antiviral treatment and adequate prevention of viral transmission, is a major challenge for clinical management in this population [12] . Cancer patients are more likely to suffer from severe seasonal influenza infections [12, 13, 14] and prolonged viral shedding, as has been reported for an H3N2 seasonal virus [15] . Prolonged shedding and the development of oseltamivir resistance in cancer patients infected with the H1N1pdm virus have not been thoroughly evaluated. Data on these aspects could have major implications for the clinical management and infection control practices for H1N1pdm-infected cancer patients [16] .",

Altogether, these 24 cases constituted the study population. All of the respiratory samples collected from the 20 rRT-PCR-confirmed patients were inoculated in cell cultures.

To our knowledge, these periods constitute the longest registered cases of H1N1pdm shedding described to date. All rRT-PCR-positive samples from these patients with the longest viral shedding durations (5645 and 5899) were culturable, meaning that these were infectious viruses ( Figure 2 and Table  S12 ). In addition, the last H1N1pdm-confirmed samples from these patients were only detected using cell culture assays, suggesting the presence of low viral loads in these specimens ( Figure 2 and Table S12 ). These patients still shed the virus for an additional 25 to 40 days after cessation of the antiviral treatment ( Figure 2 ).",

Therefore, we examined the genetic diversity of the H1N1pdm virus recovered from these severely ill patients by performing sequence analysis of the viral HA gene. No significant divergence was found in the H1N1pdm isolates collected during the onset of illness from the four patients with prolonged shedding ( Figure S1 ). To evaluate the genetic characteristics of the isolates from patients with prolonged viral shedding, we sequenced two consecutive samples from a single individual (5645s2/09 and 5645s3/09) and compared their HA sequences to other H1N1pdm viruses from mild, severe and fatal cases from different countries. We observed that samples collected a month apart (5645s2/09 and 5645s3/09) clustered together and displayed a relatively large branch length from other H1N1pdm viruses ( Figure 3 ). This result may have occurred because strain 5645s2/09 diverged from CA/ 04 in the amino acid residues L52S, L70P, P100S, C153L, T214A, Q293R and I321V (H1 numbering). Additionally, isolate 5645s3/ 09, which was sequenced from amino acid residues 167 to 413, also had the mutations T214A, Q293R and I321V fixed in the viral population a month after the initial sampling. In the isolate 5645s3/09, another mutation was also acquired, D238P, suggesting continuous viral evolution. Although we cannot determine the role of these mutations in viral pathogenesis by this result alone, the retention of the changed residues over time strongly suggests viral persistence rather than re-infection.",

Thus, oseltamivir carboxylate IC 50 values were measured for 15 H1N1pdm samples isolated from 13 patients. We found that 10 isolates were sensitive (0.8560.27 nM), and 5 displayed high IC 50 values for the antiviral used (165.13642.26 nM). These samples were sent to the WHO collaborating center at the CDC in Atlanta for resistance confirmation. We found that the isolates with high IC 50 values were endowed with a neuraminidase (NA) activity that was cross-resistant to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir, suggesting the presence of a co-pathogen endowed with NA activity within these isolates. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses (coronavirus (229, 43 and 63), parainfluenza (1, 2, 3 and 4), human metapneumovirus, parechovirus, rhinovirus, RSV A/B, adenovirus and enterovirus) or atypical bacteria (Mycobacterium pneumonia) were not identified in these samples, suggesting that no other viral source of NA activity was responsible for these high IC 50 values. However, we co-isolated a Streptococcus sp. from the samples with high IC 50 values. The NA activity of this bacterial strain displayed a phenotype resistant to NAIs. In further testing with bacteria-free H1N1pdm isolates, the virus' IC 50 were consistent with a sensitive isolate. Pyrosequencing analyses were also performed and revealed that the other high-IC 50 samples had the WT H275 residue and thus did not contain this oseltamivir resistance marker. Viruses isolated from the initial onset of illness were A/California/07-like viruses ( Figure S2 ).",

However, febrile neutropenic cancer patients have an increased risk of developing respiratory distress and multi-organ failure. Therefore, screening for respiratory viruses and prompt initiation of oseltamivir treatment should be considered in these patients. Febrile neutropenia indicates a poor prognostic with respect to a patient's outcome, but neutropenia duration in our cohort of patients was less than seven days. Thus, prolonged viral shedding might not have a correlation with neutropenia. We observed the persistence of H1N1pdm in 5 out of 10 patients studied for this purpose. In these individuals, viral shedding continued for at least 11 days, despite the use of oseltamivir. The median duration of viral shedding in our population was 23 days, and two pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed even longer virus secretions (44 and 63 days; Figure 2 and Table S10), although it is difficult to determine whether viral persistence was due to cancer per se or to acute lung injury and mechanical ventilation.",

Studies aimed at monitoring 2009 H1N1pdm virus shedding using randomized trials with appropriate controls, such as outpatients and hospitalized or immunocompromised individuals, have not yet been conducted. Because we were also unable to establish agematched controls with or without immunosuppression, since this study was conducted during the peak of the first wave of the 2009 pandemics in Brazil, we compared our work to other studies on H1N1pdm shedding in general, hospitalized or immunocompromised populations [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] . In Table 2 , we summarize the cohort used in each study, whether or not they were immunocompromised, their underlying diseases and the number of patients analyzed for viral shedding in each of these studies. We compared the maximum periods of shedding among these different populations and the number of patients that secreted the virus for more than seven days. These data would be more informative and relevant from a public health point of view because the duration of the quarantine for H1N1pdm was approximately that long [21] . We found ( Table 2 ) that in households in Hong Kong [31] and Canada [34] , the maximum periods of H1N1pdm shedding ranged from 8 to 11 days. These periods were not different from what was observed with military cadets [22] and during the containment phase of the pandemics in Vietnam [23] (Table 2) . Regarding H1N1pdm shedding among infants, Hien et al. showed that children five to nine years old could secrete the H1N1pdm virus for five to six days, which is markedly lower than what is observed for the seasonal influenza virus [30, 33] . Compared to our results, we observed higher periods of viral shedding in two seven-year-old patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Table 2 and Figure 2 ). However, a single report on two travelers in France showed that these apparently immunocompetent individuals secreted the H1N1pdm virus for 14 and 28 days [25] (Table 2 ). Although these periods of time are comparable to the time frame of virus secretion in hospitalized patients in China [23] and our work, the study from Felury et al. might be as biased as ours by the small size of the cohort ( Table 2) . Influenza-infected immunocompromised individuals may have prolonged influenza shedding [15, 21, 32, 36] ; however, more insights are necessary to better comprehend the dynamics of the H1N1pdm virus in these individuals. Mora et al. showed that in HIV-1-infected individuals, co-infection with the H1N1pdm virus might lead to an outcome not different from the one expected for immunocompetent subjects, although no systematic analysis of viral shedding was performed [36] . A similar conclusion was also drawn for transplant recipient individuals, whose longest periods of viral shedding did not exceed 11 days [32] (Table 2 ). In our study, we found periods of H1N1pdm shedding similar to what the CDC observed for leukemia patients [21] (Table 2) . Although the small size of these cohorts of immunocompromised individuals [21, 32] , including ours, may require a more conclusive and mechanistic analysis, these observations may stimulate further systematic studies to understand or gain insight into factors associated with prolonged H1N1pdm shedding. In addition, it might give insights on basic studies on influenza pathogenesis.",

An NA activity that was multiresistant to NAIs was identified and could be due to the presence of a Streptococcus strain found in throat swabs and tracheal aspirates. Pyrosequencing analyses of samples with high IC 50 values revealed that these specimens were H275 wild-type sensitive viruses. These results reinforce the need for additional genotyping assays to confirm the identification of putative resistant strains identified using functional assays. In addition, our findings show the need for investigating other sources of NA activity in virus isolates with odd IC 50 values.",

As the pandemic reached its peak in South America, the establishment of a larger and more diverse cohort with age-matched controls with or without immunosuppression became complex. Thus, more indepth multivariate and mechanistic clinical analyses were limited. Moreover, no recommendations for monitoring viral persistence were available; therefore, only a subset of severely ill patients admitted to the ICU was evaluated.

Our study may provide insights into H1N1pdm shedding and might contribute to the development of new guidelines to manage cancer patients with H1N1pdm infection.",

Patients' clinical samples were directly tested for a panel of respiratory viruses using an IFI assay for influenza A (respiratory virus panel; Biotrin, Mount Merrion, Co. Dublin, Ireland.). Specimens were also sent to the Brazilian National Influenza Center (IOC/Fiocruz) for H1N1pdm confirmation using rRT-PCR, which was performed in accordance with the current guidelines from the WHO/CDC [46] . Viral shedding was evaluated in the subset of patients that remained under mechanical ventilation for longer than seven days and in those patients with persistent hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrate. These patients received a specific number to which their sample number was appended. That is, the first sample was ''s1'', and subsequent specimens were numbered consecutively (Table  S12 ). Viral secretion was evaluated using both cell culture and rRT-PCR assays until it was negative. Virus isolation was performed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and/or embryonated eggs (see Text S1 and Table S12 ). The functional antiviral assay was performed using the NA-Star kit (Applied Biosystems, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RT-PCR protocol for sequencing using the Sanger method and pyrosequencing [48] are presented in the SI, as well as the phylogenetic analysis.",
