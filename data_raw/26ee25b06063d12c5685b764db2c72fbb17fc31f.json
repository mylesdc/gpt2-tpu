NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.",

The only susceptible animal hosts for O. volvulus are chimpanzees [9, 10] and mangabey monkeys [11] . Chimpanzees infected with O. volvulus had patent infections that lasted between 6 to 9 years with adult-worm bundles located in deep tissues with microfilariae in skin snips being detected 12-18 months post infection [12, 13] . While immunologically intact mice are resistant to infection with the infective larvae (L3) of O. volvulus [14] , adult worms within nodules have been successfully transplanted into SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdc scid /J) with the worms surviving greater than 20 weeks [15] . This observation was confirmed by the successful transplantation of adult Onchocerca ochengi into SCID mice [16] . As an alternative approach, O. volvulus L3 were implanted in primates and rodents within diffusion chambers that consist of a Lucite ring enclosed with permeable membranes, allowing for migration of cells and other humoral factors into the diffusion chamber with simultaneous containment of the parasites. O. volvulus in diffusion chambers implanted in multiple species of rodents and primates showed limited growth of larvae in all host species [17] .",

The most notable defects include those in: 1) macrophages, dendritic cells and in the complement cascade [26] [27] [28] ; 2) maturation of T and B cells [29] ; 3) NK cells; 4) signaling of 6 different cytokines [30] and 5) the presence of eosinophils in the peripheral circulation and in tissue [31] . NOD-Rag1 tm1Mom IL2rg tm1Wjl mice (NRG) are phenotypically similar to NSG mice with disruption in the B and T-Cell production [32] .

In addition, biomarkers to assess the infection status of treated individuals or macrofilaricidal activity are sorely lacking [6] [7] [8] . One of the critical barriers blocking drug and biomarker development has been the absence of suitable small animal hosts for experimentation. Hence, this study was focused on the development of a small animal model that would support the growth and maturation of O. volvulus and could serve to identify parasite specific biomarkers. To this end we tested multiple genetically defined mouse strains and xenografted (with human cells) immunodeficient mice to identify those microenvironments suitable for O. volvulus development. In so doing, we were able to develop convenient and tractable murine models that support the development of O. volvulus L3 into advanced larval stages. Moreover, we were able to use these O. volvulus-infected animals to identify parasite-derived biomarkers measurable in both urine and serum.",

In the L3, both the female and male systems are rudimentary genital primordia consisting of only several cells. In the 8-12-week old worms, the female ovejector had formed and had attached to the body wall. The ovejector was ovoid in shape, relatively large and filled the body cavity, and had a distinct lumen (Fig 3C and 3D) . Rudimentary cellular growth of the reproductive tubes was also evident (Fig 3D) . In males, the testis, located at approximately mid-body, had become elongate in shape and had looped posteriorly to form a classic shepherd's crook (Fig 3E) . In addition, the spicule pads were well developed and demarcated (Fig 3F) but were still oval in shape and had not yet started to take on the shape of the spicules nor was there any evidence of cuticularization.

Published findings on the susceptibility of mice to infection with the L3 of O. volvulus suggest that mice are resistant to infection when the larvae were injected subcutaneously [14] .

The CC mouse project was developed to produce an extremely diverse set of inbred animals that could be used for mapping different genetic traits [57] . Five different CC mouse strains, selected based on their diverse genetic backgrounds, were tested for susceptibility to O. volvulus and were completely resistant to the infection. This observation suggests that either mice are missing some integral factors required for parasite growth or the immune responses in mice are effective at eliminating the infection. The question remains as to why parasites are recovered live from diffusion chambers implanted in mice but not when injected into the tissues. There are several possible explanations including: (1) the diffusion chamber acts as a barrier from the immune response creating an immune privileged site, (2) the larvae within the diffusion chamber are blocked from migrating through the tissue releasing excretory and secretory products and thereby eliciting an immune reaction, or (3) the diffusion chamber attracts host components to the parasite microenvironment that are beneficial for parasite development.",

These findings demonstrate that the mouse immune response was capable of controlling infection with O. volvulus, with elements of the mouse immune response eliminating the infection in immunologically intact mice. Many mechanisms have been described for innate immune control of nematode infections in mice [39, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] all or some of which may be effective against O. volvulus.

            "text": "In vitro studies on the development of filarial worms including O. volvulus [69, 70] and Brugia malayi [71] have demonstrated that host cells are needed in the culture wells to optimize parasite growth and development. Furthermore, optimal development and survival of larval T. spiralis in mice requires the presence of mouse eosinophils [33] . It was thus hypothesized that adding human cells to the NSG mice, from the tissues that the parasites are normally found juxtaposed in humans, might provide additional required nutritional or developmental elements found in humans required for parasite development and survival. Four different single cell xenografts were screened: HuSkMc, LEC, HaCaT and BESM. Of these four cell lines, HuSkMc was found to support the highest average percent survival of the implanted worms and consistent infection rates over a 12-week time period (Figs 1 and 2) As an alternative to adding single cell populations to the NSG mice, multipotential umbilical cord stem cells were transferred to the immunodeficient mice. NSG, NSG-SGM, and NRG mice, all of which lack functional immune responses, were humanized with CD34 + umbilical cord stem cells. The humanization of the various immunocompromised mouse strains resulted in the development of an immature human immune system. The developing immune system in these mice displays a T-independent response, limited antigen-specific IgM responses, and the presence of multiple innate immune cells has been noted [25] . When humanized NSG, NSG-SGM, and NRG mice were infected with O. volvulus L3, higher GM parasite recoveries were observed when compared to NSG mice without any human cells but these enhancements were not significant. Although NSG-SGM did have consistent infection rates with O. volvulus we had significant difficulties establishing reliable engraftment of human cells in this strain of mice. Extending this concept further, BLT mice which contain CD34 + stem cells in addition to fetal tissue were used. BLT mice are known to develop a more mature version of a human immune system. Limited T-dependent recognition is seen within these mice and better overall functionality of both the B and T-cells has been documented [36] . BLT mice supported the highest average parasite recoveries of any mouse model tested at 4-weeks, although the average fell to be in line with the HuNSG and HuSkMc models by 8-weeks post infection. The mean lengths of the parasites recovered from 4-and 8-week time points from the NSG mice were comparable to those recovered from BLT mice. This suggests a link between the enhanced survival, may be related to the presence of the human immune cells, but the growth of the parasites that survive may not be related to the human cell byproducts. Although cellular engraftments levels in BLT and HuNSG mice were not rechecked at the end of the experiment previously published data have shown that these animals reliably hold their engraftments for extended periods of time [72, 73] .",

L3 implanted within diffusion chambers in both non-human primates and mice successfully molt into L4 but the lengths of the recovered parasites were significantly shorter than those recovered at 8 and 12 weeks post infection from the mice tested in this study [17] . While non-human primates can support the development of the parasites from L3 to microfilariae producing adults, cost and ethical considerations limit the utility of primates for drug discovery and antigen identification [10, 14] . Nodules containing adult worms recovered from humans have been implanted into SCID mice and the female worms survived and released microfilariae [15] . This method allows for identification of adult antigens and biomarkers, but lacks the intermediate L3 and L4 stages of development. Finally, an alternative model using adult male O. ochengi implanted into SCID mice has been developed for the identifying filaricides [16] , which may also be effective against O. volvulus. The NSG models developed in this study have the critical advantage of working with O. volvulus, thereby allowing species-specific screening of filaricides and identification of biomarkers.",

After defrosting, 100 individual parasites were selected, attempting to identify only the viable/undamaged L3. It is reasonable to predict that a percentage of larvae exiting from the mouth parts of a black fly have the potential to resume development in the human host and that the cryopreservation process damaged some of those worms. Approximately 50 percent of the larvae recovered after cryopreservation survived in diffusion chambers implanted in mice, which may explain the overall number of worms recovered from the different mouse models in this study. While minor differences in the overall larval recovery levels were observed between individual batches of cryopreserved larvae, multiple batches were combined before implantation to help ensure a consistent viability level going into the animal hosts. Even with the combination of multiple batches of larvae it cannot be ruled out that the overall viability of the injected larvae played a role in the observed recovery rates. The recovery rates of O. volvulus larvae after developing in NSG mice with or without human cells was in the same order of magnitude as that reported for the recovery of adult filarial worms, where infections were initiated by larvae recovered directly from the insect vector. These infections included Brugia pahangi in cats [74] , Brugia malayi in leaf-monkey [75] , and Onchocerca ochengi in cattle [76] . In the final analysis, optimal parasite recovery was observed in mice humanized with HuSkMc (maximum of 10 worms), HuNSG (maximum of 18 worms) and BLT mice (maximum of 10 worms).",

Though most of the proteins were identified by one or more unique peptide(s), among the proteins with unknown function (OVOC9087, OVOC835, OVOC224), OVOC9087 does not have orthologues in other filarial species and hence would likely be able to distinguish O. volvulus from other filarial infections.
