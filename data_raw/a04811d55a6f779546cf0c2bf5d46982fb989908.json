            "text": "Background and Aim: Rhipicephalus microplus (Rm) is one of the most problematic livestock tick species in the world. Its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and Benin particularly. The aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife and to confirm the possible role of reservoir wildlife may play in the propagation of the parasite. This will help to design more efficient control strategy. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted from February to March 2017 in the National Parks of Benin (Pendjari and W Park) and wildfowl's assembly and selling point in Benin. Ticks were manually picked with forceps from each animal after slaughtering by hunters then stored in 70\u00b0 ethanol. Collected ticks were counted and identified in the laboratory using the identification key as described by Walker. Results: Overall, seven species of ticks (Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rm, Boophilus spp., Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus spp.) were identified on nine wild animal species sampled (Cane rat, wildcat, Hare, Doe, Cricetoma, Buffalo, Buffon Cobe, and Bushbuck and Warthog). The average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species, 3 to 7 between localities visited, and 2 to 5 between tick species. However, these differences are statistically significant only for localities. Considering tick species and animal species, the parasite load of Rm and Rhipicephalus spp. is higher; the buffalo being more infested. The analysis of deviance reveals that the abundance of ticks observed depends only on the observed localities (p>0.05). However, the interactions between animal species and localities on the one hand and between animal and tick species on the other hand, although not significant, have influenced the abundance of ticks as they reduce the residual deviance after their inclusion in the model. Conclusion: This study reported the presence of Rm in wildlife of Benin and confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites. It is, therefore, an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the West African sub-region and particularly in Benin.",

            "text": "Ticks' host, like all parasites host, plays an important role in their distribution. Ticks spend almost all their time with the host and move from one point to another with them. Female ticks leave their host and fall into the environment, lay eggs when they are fully engorged. New larvae will look for another host, and the cycle will restart [1] . Tick-borne diseases have a significant impact on animal productivity and cause economic losses for livestock owners. This is a major obstacle for the livestock sector development in Africa and Benin, in particular, due to the presence of a large number of tick species including Rhipicephalus mipcroplus (Rm), one of the most feared species [2] . The previous study has shown that Rm is a vector of Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, and Anaplasma marginale [3] . In Benin, the introduction of Rm was largely attributed to the importation of Girolando cattle from Brazil by the Government of Benin through the Pafilav Project which aim was to improve local breed milk production [4] . The first study conducted on October 2008 in the village of Kpinnou, the main site of Girolando cattle in Benin, indicated the presence of Rm and the suitability of local conditions for its development [5] . As stated by different findings, this tick species has rapidly spread all over the country [6] . Ticks collection and identification from domestic animals were done several times for research purposes. Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.11/June-2018/18.pdf Wildlife is often pointed to act as a reservoir of tick-borne disease for domestic animals and, vice versa [7] [8] [9] . Some studies confirm this perception for some diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu) [10] [11] [12] . For pastoralist, wildlife can be the cause of economic disasters when the survival or profitability of the domestic herd is threatened by epizootics or endozooties in which the fauna acts as a carrier, reservoir, or intermediate host [13] . However, no investigation has yet been done on wild species following the identification and spread of Rm, which stands out for its resistance to common acaricides and is a real problem for ruminant farms in Benin [14] .",

It has four-seasons (two rainy and two dry seasons) with fertile soils and degradation of ecological conditions. The rainfall reaches 1500 mm. Benin has five agro-pastoral zones: the dry Sudanese zone with marginal pastures, the Sudanese surplus grassland zone, the Sudano-Guinean zone with abundant forage resources, the semi-humid zone with agricultural vocation which becomes a zone of breeding and the forest zone [15, 16] . Benin cattle herd is estimated at 2,166,000 head on 2015 [17] , 90% of the animal is found in the Northern part of the country. The town of Banikoara, where W Park is located has the greatest number of cattle all over the country. The main ruminant breeds raised in these different agro-pastoral areas are Borgou, Somba, Ndama, Lagunaire, Mbororo, and White Fulani and their crossbred's products for cattle; Djallonke sheep, Peulh sheep, Guinean dwarf goat, Maradi red goat, and Peulh goat for small ruminants. The whole country is suitable for animal husbandry, except a small area in the northern and southern part of the country [18] .",

It has also been identified in Senegal on Luzarches hartebeest and then the bushbuck and warthog in the Niokolo-koba National Park. In the North East of Central Africa, the work of Thal [25] also mentioned the presence of this species on hartebeest and roan. Indeed, according to this author, it is the only Boophilus that could be found on wild ungulates in West Africa. However, although our samples were taken from ungulates such as C. elaphus, Syncerus caffer planiceros, Kobus kob, Tragelaphus scrip tus, and Phacochoerus aethiopi cus, this species has not been identified. Its absence could be linked to a mutation phenomenon leading to the appearance of Rm. This phenomenon was already described in East Africa where Rm replaced the other Rhipicephalus species [26] . The highest presence Rm in the hunting camp of the Mekrou and Koncombri can be explained by the fact that there are next to Burkina Faso. Moreover, the presence of water table next to W park hunting area in Popoman attract transhumant animals from Burkina-Faso and could explain the strong representation of Rm in the Mekrou area. Indeed, these camps are located at the Benin-Burkina border where there is a large movement of live cattle from Burkina to Benin through livestock trade. This is corroborated by recent findings that revealed the presence of this tick in Benin and Benin-Burkina Faso border [27] .",

However, Rhipicephalus spp. is present in all the prospected localities. The absence of R. sanguineus in this study in the parks may be related to the prohibition of hunting that would have limited dog access to the parks. In fact, illegal hunters are often accompanied by their dogs, which constitute the main host of R. sanguineus in the tropics and subtropics as reported by Fahmy et al. [30] . A high probability of dissemination of this tick on the natural route by these dogs and thus an infestation of wild animals is possible. This has been proven by the work of Smith et al. [31] .",

These results are in concordance with those obtained by Morel [23] . Indeed, Hyalomma ticks are generally found on wild ungulates and rodents.

            "text": "Of all these species, it should be noted that the proportion of nymph and larva is very low or almost absent. Indeed, previous work carried in the same areas and during the same month's revealed low abundance of nymph and larva [34] . This observation can be explained by several factors such as the height of the animals considered, targeted animals are old, and old animals are big in size what make does not favor nymph and larva to attach to them; the climate: February and March are hot and larva and nymph are more sensitive to heat than adults. Moreover, this period is the most favorable for the availability of wildfowl, and illegal hunters use bushfires to find wildfowl. As a result, these bushfires, kill immature ticks hidden in the environment. According to Verdonck [35] , immature survival is very dependent on humidity during the hot season; the abundance of Rm, for example, begins to decrease at the end of the rainy season. Likewise, tick activity varies according to species and climatic conditions [36] . However, the massive presence of ticks does not always correspond to the rainiest months. Farougou et al. [22] showed a low correlation between rainfall and number of ticks collected. This result can be explained by the fact that some ticks appear before the rainy season. The finding may also be related to genus and stage of development that persist in moisture and sometimes other sources of moisture at the vegetation level. Similarly, Fahmy et al. [30] showed that Rm can grow in warm and humid regions, B. decoloratus in dry and cold areas, and Boophilus annulatus can survive in areas suitable both for Rm and B. decoloratus. This fact has also been confirmed by several researchers [37, 38] . Madder et al. [27] and Muhimuzi et al. [39] also reported that B. annulatus and B. geigyi might share the same habitats associated with woods and forests and favor similar environmental requirements as well.",

The lower number of tick collected in our case is due to the reluctance of some hunters to allow ticks collection from their animals.
