However, a large difference in HA incidence between Canada and HA-endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis A prevalence in Canada. There is also a (smaller) incidence differential between Canada and the US. Although the US has only moderately higher HA incidence, the volume of travel by Canadians to the US is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries. Hence, travel to the US may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for Canadian travelers. To our knowledge, travel to the US has never been included as a potential risk factor for HA infection in Canadian epidemiologic analyses. The objective of this study was to use dynamic models to investigate the possible effects on hepatitis A incidence in Canada due to (1) implementing vaccination in the US, and (2) varying the volume of travel by Canadians to the US.",

One example is HIV, where prevalence is 6% in sub-Saharan Africa but only 0.3% in Western Europe [2] . A less striking but still significant example is hepatitis A (HA). HA is a non-endemic, low-incidence disease in the US and Canada, but is highly endemic in many other countries [3] [4] [5] [6] . The average reported HA incidence in Canada was 6.3 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1994 [7] , and the average reported HA incidence in the US was 10.5 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1999 [8] . By comparison, in 1990, reported incidence ranged from 20 to 60 per 100,000 per year in Africa and the Middle East (depending on the country), 10 to 30 in Asia, and 20 to 40 in Central and South America [9] . Moreover, reported incidence significantly underestimates actual incidence due to underreporting and subclinical infection [6, 8, 10] . Because subclinical infection is more common in children, who are infected more frequently in developing countries than developed countries, the global differential in true infection levels is much higher than for reported incidence.",

This issue has implications for policy, since it implies that health interventions in one country may potentially influence health outcomes in other countries. This question also has implications not only for hepatitis A but for many diseases such as SARS, as burgeoning air travel turns local problems into global problems. In this paper, we develop mathematical (agestructured compartmental) models of hepatitis A transmission and vaccination in Canada and the US. We use travel data to couple the two countries epidemiologically through travel. We focus on these two countries (rather than attempting a global model) because of the relatively good availability of data for the US and Canada and the close relationship of Canada to the US. The coupled model allows us to analyze how transmission and vaccination in the US may be affecting HA incidence in Canada. ",

In Canada and the US, unlike most developing countries, hepatitis A is transmitted mostly by person-to-person contact, by the fecal-oral route [10] . Unlike in many countries, foodborne outbreaks are very infrequent in Canada [18] . Children play an important role in transmission due to their higher rates of subclinical infection and poor hygiene [19] . Clinical illness typically lasts four weeks, there is no chronic state of infection [20] , and natural immunity is lifelong. Although 70% of infected post-adolescents develop jaundice, many do not seek medical attention [10, 21] . Individuals with symptomatic HA infection experience nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain and jaundice [21] . Hepatitis A infection is more severe in older individuals or those with co-morbidities such as chronic liver disease [22, 23] .

The adjusted incidence values reported here are the predicted incidence of reported cases adjusted for subclinical infection and under-reporting. Hence, the adjusted incidence represents the true incidence of all HA infections. If reported incidence were plotted instead, the qualitative results would be the same and the quantitative results would be similar except for a scaling due to the adjustment for underreporting and subclinical infection. Figure 3 shows the adjusted incidence in Canada at the equilibrium state of the dynamic model as a function of vaccination coverage in the 0-4 age class in the US. As the vaccine coverage in the US increases, the adjusted HA incidence in Canada decreases significantly. For instance, universal vaccination in the US at 70% coverage in the 0-4 age class causes a 21% decline in the adjusted Canadian incidence, across all age classes. Hence, this allows us to infer that approximately 21% of Canadian incidence was attributable to travel in the United States, in the years for which the model was parameterized (1980 to 1994).",

Within a few years of the start of the US vaccination programme, adjusted incidence has also declined in Canada significantly. The choice of 1995 as the year that vaccination begins is motivated by the fact that 1994 was the last year before HA vaccine became widely available in the US and Canada.

This, coupled with the enormous annual volume of Canadian travel to the US compared to endemic countries, means that the US could be a more significant source of travel-related infection (particularly for hepatitis A) than previously recognized. Indeed, the results in the previous section illustrate the potential impact of hepatitis A transmission and vaccination in the US on HA prevalence in Canada. Simulation results based on the assumptions in Equation 1 show that a significant proportion (22%) of HA incidence in the mid 1990's, before vaccination was introduced, may have been attributable to travel in the US. Hence, some of the declines in HA incidence observed after 1994 in Canada ( Figure 2 ) may partly be due to the start of universal vaccination in the higher-incidence regions of the US in the mid-1990s.",

Firstly, these results assume the contribution due to travel in the US is similar to the contribution due to travel to endemic countries, adjusted for the total passenger-days in those respective destinations as well as the difference in incidence between Canada and the respective destination (Equation 1). Moreover, here we have neglected cohort effects for the sake of simplicity [33] . In reality, the age-structured seroprevalence profile for hepatitis A exhibits a cohort effect, whereby the seroprevalence in older age classes is higher than can be explained by the current force of infection (thus implying that the force of infection was higher in the past). The existence of a cohort effect influences how the disease can be modeled. In particular, if the cohort effect is neglected and it is assumed that transmission rates have always been constant, then the dynamic model will overpredict the average population incidence both before and after vaccination, and will also overpredict the percentage reduction in incidence due to vaccination [33] . Finally, there is social heterogeneity within countries in risk factors and transmission patterns for hepatitis A that may be important for modelling certain aspects of disease transmission. Geographical heterogeneity in travel destinations of Canadian traveling to the US may also be important.",

The example of hepatitis A transmission in Canada and the US represents the (significantly less spectacular) flipside to that of SARS: the decline of hepatitis A in Canada may partly be attributable to universal vaccination in the US. Other modelling work illustrates how nonvaccinators in a population can \"freeride\" by taking advantage of the herd immunity provided by vaccinators [38] [39] [40] [41] . This has been compared to a Prisoner's Dilemma (wherein vaccinators are \"cooperators\" and nonvaccinators are \"defectors\") and analyzed using game theory [39] [40] [41] . In the same way, entire countries can also \"free-ride\" by benefiting from vaccination programmes carried out in and funded by other countries. As international air travel continues to increase, vaccination policies and public health policies in one country will become increasingly important to other countries. In the future, multi-country or multi-regional models may come into more common usage.",

The possibility of such a connection is also supported by other evidence, such as the positive correlation in hepatitis A incidence in the US and Canada from 1980 to 1994 ( Figure 1 ). Hence, declines in reported incidence since the mid-1990s observed in Canada may be partially attributable to vaccination in the US. Future epidemiological studies of risk factors for HA infection should include travel to the US as a variable in risk factor analysis.

A previous study estimates that, to date, about 7% of the Canadian population has been vaccinated under this programme (which also vaccinates travelers to endemic countries) (Bauch et al, unpublished data). Hence, we assume in this paper a 7% coverage rate for each age class. Although the actual coverage rates across age classes under the current targeted policy may be dissimilar, the available data do not allow us to stratify the vaccine coverage rates by age. Hence, we have assumed the same vaccination rate applies to each age class. We note that there are also other heterogeneities in vaccine coverage (e.g., social) that the present model was not designed to address. The values of g i are obtained from imposing f = 0, as for the US case, as well as the constraints on System A2, and solving System A2 to yield g C = 0.001937 year -1 . .. ",
