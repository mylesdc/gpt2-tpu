However, the characteristics of influenza in Southeast of China haven't been fully studied. Our study use the surveillance data collected from 16 sentinel hospitals across Zhejiang Province during March 2011 through June 2015, including the demographic information and respiratory specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients. As analysis results, most SARI and ILI patients were in the age group of 0-4 years old (62.38% of ILI and 71.54% of SARI). The respiratory specimens have statistically significantly higher positive rate for influenza among ILI patients than that among SARI patients (p < 0.001). The comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significantly difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype. The SARI and ILI patients were found to be positively correlated for overall positive rate (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), the weekly percentage of A(H1N1)pdm09 (r = 0.51, p < 0.001), influenza B virus (r = 0.17, p = 0.013), and A/H3N2 (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) among all the positive numbers. Our study demonstrated that the activities of influenza virus, including its subtypes, had a similar temporal pattern between ILI and SARI cases.",

The collection of swabs was conducted by trained nurses from who had not received antiviral drugs. In addition, a standardized case report form containing demographic and sample information was also required to complete among whose biological samples had been collected. Due to the outbreak of avian influenza A(H7N9) in April 2013, ILI surveillance was strengthened by increasing the weekly number of the biological samples collected in each hospital from 5-15 to 20. The biological samples were collected and saved in cryovial tubes, stored at 4 \u2022 C at the sentinel site, and then sent to regional center for disease control and prevention (CDC) within 48 h after the sample collected. The regional CDC laboratory tested influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay following the standard protocols. Specimens tested as positive for influenza A were further tested for subtypes (i.e., A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H7N9)) using specific rRT-PCR. Once the laboratory complete, regional CDC submitted the laboratory results to the online surveillance system.",

Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the differences of age, sex, season, influenza virus type/subtype, and influenza positive rate between all the sampled ILI and SARI cases. The weekly number of positive influenza by subtype and the percentage of specimens tested positively were plotted to describe seasonality and circulation of influenza types/subtypes among SARI and ILI cases. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter were defined from week 11 to 21, 22 to 38, 39 to 48, and 49 to 10 of the next year, respectively [22] . Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to analyze the trend change of influenza virus positivity with the increase of age. Spearman correlation was applied to analyze the linear relationship of the influenza virus positive rate, weekly percentage of influenza virus subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients. ILI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total outpatient visits that were due to ILI and SARI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total admissions that were due to SARI. To compare ILI percentage and SARI percentage of which can better reflect the activity of influenza virus among outpatients and inpatients, Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the linear relationship between weekly ILI influenza-positive rate and ILI percentage, as well as weekly SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate. A two-sided p-values were considered as statistically significant if it was found less than 0.05. All the statistics were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).",

Children less than 5 years of age were found to be the largest group of both ILI and SARI patients, which was consistent with those reported by other studies [10, 16, 17] . Besides, we found a good agreement between SARI and ILI patients for the weekly proportion of samples tested positively for influenza virus and the distribution of the influenza virus types/subtypes among all the identified patients. This demonstrated that the seasonal pattern and predominant circulation types of influenza were similar between ILI and SARI patients. Finally, we found that the correlation between the weekly influenza positive rates and percentages of patients meeting the definition of ILI and SARI is higher among ILI patients than it among SARI patients, which indicated that compared to ILI, influenza may less important in causing SARI.",

This difference might be caused by the different behaviors when a child or an adult is found to be sick. Compared to adults, children are more likely to be taken to hospital, especially for SARI cases. Therefore, children have SARI were more likely to be involved in the surveillance. Similar results have been obtained in Mongolia [10] , Philippines [11] , Jordan [23] . Our findings further demonstrated that young children are vulnerable for both mild and severe respiratory infection, and the low influenza detection rate among 0-4 years age-group in both SARI and ILI patients foreshadow the need of expand the respiratory illness surveillance to more types of pathogens [12, 24] .",

The simple and preferred measure to assess and compare seasonality patterns was the proportion of influenza positives [27] . The highly correlated influenza virus positive rate between SARI and ILI patients demonstrated the similar temporal pattern of influenza activity in the two groups. Similar findings were recently reported in a description of influenza surveillance in Egypt, which showed that the seasonality of influenza among ILI cases and SARI cases was consisted in November-February [19] . Moreover, the comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significantly difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype, which was similar to the findings from Nigeria [16] . Finally, the correlation of weekly percentage of influenza virus type/subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients indicated that the predominant influenza types/subtypes among ILI and SARI cases was corresponded. These findings are essential for planning influenza vaccination programmes for those severe cases given recommendations for strain inclusion within the vaccine are based on the ILI surveillance system. Our results were consistent to the study conducted by Peng et al. in the year of 2015 [4] . But in that study, the detailed analyses such as correlation analysis between weekly ILI influenza-positive rate and SARI influenza-positive rate, ILI percentage and ILI influenza-positive rate, SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate were not performed. Therefore, we believe the present study can provide more comprehensive information on the comparison of influenza epidemiological and virological characteristics between outpatients and inpatients.",

These phenomena may due to the higher specificity of the ILI diagnosis compared to the SARI diagnosis [28] .

Therefore, the subject chosen for ILI sampled may prone to sicker patients or younger patients. Second, compared to ILI surveillance, SARI surveillance may be less representative due to its sparse surveillance sites. In the future, we should consider to expand and to enhance the coverage of the surveillance network, with priority to choose hospitals from ILI surveillance.

The seasonal patterns of influenza virus were shown in Figure 5. The winter-spring peaks were observed in each of the study year for ILI, and the summer peaks were only observed in the year of 2012 and 2014. The strengthened surveillance after the A(H7N9) outbreak led to the great increase of total number of flu positive samples from 2011-2012 to 2013-2015 (Figure 5A), while the positive rate at peaks remained largely the same in the whole study period, except for the 2012/2013 winter, which may be caused by the abnormal weather condition (the higher humidity and lower temperature), the emerging A(H7N9) virus and the vaccination campaign for A(H1N1)pdm09 launched in previous years. A(H3N2) was the predominant types/subtypes of the summer peaks in 2012 and 2014, while the predominant types/subtypes of the winter-spring were different across study years; influenza B is predominant and co-circulated with A(H3N2) during the 2011-2012 winter-spring peak; A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2012-2013 winter-spring; a mix of A(H3N2), influenza B, and A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2013-2014 winter-spring; and influenza B during the 2014-2015 winter-spring (",
