            "text": "Bovine NK-lysins, which are functionally and structurally similar to human granulysin and porcine NK-lysin, are predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NKcells. Although antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin has been assessed for several bacterial pathogens, not all the important bacterial pathogens that are involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex have been studied. Therefore the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on bovine respiratory pathogen Histophilus somni. Four, 30-mer peptides corresponding to the functional region of NK-lysin helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity on four bovine pneumonic H. somni isolates. Although there were some differences in the efficiency of bactericidal activity among the NK-lysin peptides at lower concentrations (2-5 \u03bcM), all four peptides effectively killed most H. somni isolates at higher concentrations (10-30 \u03bcM) as determined by a bacterial killing assay. Confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of Live/Dead Baclight stained H. somni (which were preincubated with NK-lysin peptides) were consistent with the killing assay findings and suggest NK-lysin peptides are bactericidal for H. somni. Among the four peptides, NK2A-derived peptide consistently showed the highest antimicrobial activity against all four H. somni isolates. Electron microscopic examination of H. somni following incubation with NK-lysin revealed extensive cell membrane damage, protrusions of outer membranes, and cytoplasmic content leakage. Taken together, the findings from this study clearly demonstrate the antimicrobial activity of all four bovine NK-lysinderived peptides against bovine H. somni isolates.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial proteins were first described in early 1960s with the identification of three basic proteins with bactericidal activities from a lysosomal fraction of guinea-pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes [1] . Based on the molecular masses and antimicrobial activities, these proteins were later named as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The AMPs, or host defense peptides, are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response and have been isolated from bacteria, insects and other invertebrates, birds, fish, amphibians, plants, and mammals [2] [3] [4] [5] . Based on the amino acid composition and structure, AMPs are divided into several subgroups such as anionic peptides, linear cationic \u03b1-helical peptides, cationic peptides enriched for specific amino acids, anionic and cationic peptides that contain cysteine and form disulfide bonds, and anionic and cationic peptide fragments of larger proteins [6] . The majority of AMPs are known to interact with the lipid bilayer, leading to formation of ion channels, transmembrane pores, and membrane rupture resulting in microbial cell lysis, although AMPs can also interact with other microbial intracellular targets [6] . Human granulysin as well as porcine and bovine NK-lysin, have also been described as AMPs [7] [8] [9] . Granulysin and NK-lysin are found in the cytosolic granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK cells and have been found to exhibit activity against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and tumor cells [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Both granulysin and NK-lysin are structurally related to the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family of lipid binding proteins [8, 12, 13] . Although most mammalian species, including humans and swine, have only a single antimicrobial protein gene (granulysin or NK-lysin), the cattle genome is known to contain four functional NK-lysin genes, NK1, NK2A, NK2B and NK2C [10] . Gene expression analysis has revealed that while NK1 and NK2A were highly expressed in the intestinal Peyer's patches, while NK2C was highly expressed in the lungs [10, 14] . It has also been previously reported that the potent antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin is associated with helix 2 through helix 3 regions [9, 10, 14] .",

BRDC develop as a complex interaction between environmental stress factors, host factors, and multiple viral and bacterial infectious agents [17] . Various viral pathogens such as bovine herpes virus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza-3, bovine coronavirus and bovine adenoviruses have been implicated to predispose calves to secondary bacterial infections. The most important bacterial pathogens associated with BRDC are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis [15, 17] . Each of these bacteria are commensals in the nasopharynx of cattle. H. somni is a Gram negative bacterium and is a commensal of the upper respiratory as well as genitourinary tracts of cattle [15] . H. somni can cause a wide variety of disorders in cattle in addition to respiratory disease, including septicemia, thrombotic meningoencephalitis, arthritis, myocarditis, and abortions [18] .",

It has also been previously reported that compared to M. haemolytica isolates, P. multocida isolates were less susceptible to bovine NK-lysin mediated killing. M. haemolytica isolates were susceptible for NK2A and NK2C, but they were resistant to NK1 and NK2B. However, P. multocida isolates were susceptibility to NK1 and NK2A, they were resistant to NK2B and NK2C. Since these two closely related pathogens showed differential sensitivity to bovine NK-lysins, it was of our interest to assess the sensitivity of the other most important BRDC associated pathogen H. somni to bovine NK-lysins. Therefore, all four bovine NK-lysin derived peptides corresponding to the functional region of helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and their antimicrobial activity on several bovine pneumonic isolates of H. somni were examined. Ultrastructural changes to the cell membrane of H. somni following incubation with NK2A peptide were also examined.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is yet to be fully understood, previous studies report that AMPs can damage outer and inner bacterial membranes [6, 21] . H. somni isolates were sensitive to NK-lysin-derived peptides as evidenced by reduction in bacterial numbers (CFUs/ml) in killing assays (Fig 1) however, it was not clear whether the antibacterial activity of NK-lysin peptides on H. somni were bactericidal or bacteriostatic. Therefore to identify the mechanism of action, we performed Live/Dead bacterial viability staining after the incubation of H. somni with peptides. Syto 9 is a cell permeant green-fluorescent dye which can efficiently bind with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA. Unlike Syto 9, propidium iodide is a cell non-permeant red-fluorescent dye and only stain DNA in the cells with compromised cell membranes. Therefore, we used Live/Dead bacterial viability staining kit containing both Syto 9 and propidium iodide to differentiate live from dead bacteria after incubation with NK-lysin peptides. As expected, majority of bacteria in control sample stained with Syto 9 (green, Fig 2A) and in killed bacteria stained with propidium iodide (red, Fig 2F) . These findings confirmed that the cell membranes of live bacteria were intact. The damage to H. somni cell membranes was clearly visible as bacteria treated with NK-lysin peptides stained mostly with propidium iodide (Fig 2) . Unlike with NK2B ( Fig  2D) and NK2C (Fig 2E) , clumping of dead H. somni were observed following incubation with NK1 ( Fig 2B) and NK2A (Fig 2C) . Concurrently, similarly incubated H. somni samples were also analyzed by flow cytometry. Since dead bacteria tended to clump, samples were thoroughly mixed before flow cytometry and electronic gates were positioned for single cell discrimination. Again as expected, most of the bacteria in the control sample were viable with intact cell membranes ( Fig 3A) and all the bacteria treated with ethanol were found dead with compromised cell membranes (Fig 3F) . Over 93% of H. somni, when incubated with NK-lysin peptides, were positive for propidium iodide staining or in the dead bacterial region further confirming the damage to the bacterial cell membranes (Fig 3B-3E) . Taken together, both confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analysis suggest that all four NK-lysin peptides caused damage to H. somni cell membranes and are bactericidal in nature.",

Both our confocal microscopic and flow cytometry analysis (Figs 2 and 3) confirmed that bovine NK-lysins caused damage to H. somni cell membranes, but we wished to further evaluate whether NK-lysin peptides can also interact with other bacterial targets, specifically with H. somni DNA. Therefore, H. somni was incubated with NK2A-Cy5 conjugate (for 30 min) and observed the bacteria under confocal microscope after staining bacterial DNA with DAPI. Unconjugated or free Cy5 dye did not bind with bacteria but their nuclear materials were clearly stained with DAPI ( Fig 4A) . Although NK2A-Cy5 staining was visible with H. somni, we did not observe any colocalization of NK2A-Cy5 conjugate with DAPI ( Fig 4B) suggesting that NK2A did not bind with DNA, but interacted with bacterial cell membrane.",

AMPs such as granulysin and NK-lysin are wellknown to kill both Gram-positive and-negative bacteria, parasites and fungi [9, 12] . Propidium iodide is widely used in flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy to differentiate live from dead cells as it cannot cross the intact membrane of live cells (to stain DNA). In our propidium iodide uptake assay, both NK2A untreated and kanamycin treated samples did not show any increase in PI fluorescence suggesting a lack of H. somni cell membrane damage. However, time-as well as concentration-dependent increased in PI fluorescence or PI uptake in NK2A treated samples was observed strongly suggesting NK2A-induced H. somni cell membrane damage. Furthermore, incubation of H. somni with Cy5 directly conjugated NK2A peptide confirmed a lack of association of bovine NK-lysin with bacterial DNA, but rather showed an interaction with bacterial cell membranes. Although our confocal microscopic images confirmed the extensive damage to H. somni cell membranes following incubation with NK-lysin peptides as treated bacteria were positive for propidium iodide staining, the resolution of the confocal images were not adequate to identify ultrastructural changes to the bacterial cell membranes. Therefore, we assessed ultrastructural morphological changes of control and NKlysin treated H. somni by transmission electron microscopy. As has been observed with other bacterial pathogens [10, 14] , electron micrographs confirmed the rupture of H. somni inner membranes when incubated with NK2A. It has been previously reported that NK-lysin induced damage to P. multocida cell membranes with cytosolic content leakage, but without membrane-enclosed bodies [14] . Such membrane-free coagulated content leakage was not very visible with H. somni upon incubation with NK-lysin. Rather most of the cytosolic contents were observed to be attached to the bacterial outer membrane or released as outer membrane enclosed vesicles/bodies. Similar single to multiple outer membrane protrusions development have been previously reported with Mycobacterium tuberculosis when incubated with human granulysin [12] .",

A subunit vaccine comprised of a recombinantly expressed DR2 domain of ibpA [23] or multiple antigens expressed using a genome-based reverse vaccinology technique with a field H. somni isolate [24] showed enhanced protection in cattle against subsequent challenge with H. somni. In this study, we showed that all four NK-lysin peptides are highly effective against four different H. somni isolates, but at 10 \u03bcM or higher concentrations. Therefore, combination of NK-lysin peptides, particularly NK2A, with H. somni recombinant or subunit vaccines might provide enhanced protection in cattle against H. somni infections. However, one must consider the cost associated with AMP production particularly for large animal trials, as well as the possibility of development of resistance to AMPs by microorganisms. However, such resistance to AMPs among microbes has been shown to be very limited. Furthermore, although several AMPs are in clinical trials, the FDA has yet to approve any AMPs for medical usage. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether bovine NK-lysin in general, and NK2A in particular, can be used as a treatment or preventive to reduce the occurrence of BRDC in calves.",

Moreover, electron microscopic analyses revealed that NK-lysin-derived peptide (NK2A) caused extensive damage to H. somni inner and outer membrane, cytosolic content leakage, as well as protrusions of outer membranes. Based on our results and those observed previously [14] , now we can conclude that bovine NK-lysin-derived peptide NK2A is effective against the bacteria agents involved in BRDC such as M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni.",
