The RNA/DNA/cDNA template was tested in a real-time PCR using primers, probes and PCR assay conditions specific for adenoviruses, parainfluenza virus 1-4 12 , human bocavirus 13 , human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E 14, 15 , respiratory syncytial virus (A and B) 16, 17 , human metapneumovirus 18 , human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and human influenza virus A 19 and B 20 (Supplementary Table 9 ). Initially, a multiplex PCR was carried out to detect parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, parainfluenza virus 2 and 4 or human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E. If positive, a monoplex species-specific PCR was performed. All other viral PCRs were performed separately for each virus. For each PCR a total reaction volume of 12.5 \u00b5L, containing 5 \u00b5L template, 6.25 \u00b5L",

PCR amplicon libraries were generated by amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using barcoded primers directed at the V4 hypervariable region, as previously described 22 . Primer pair 533F/806R was used for amplification. Amplicon pools from samples and controls were sequenced in seven runs using an Illuminia MiSeq instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), resulting in paired-end 250 nucleotide reads. We applied an adaptive, window-based trimming algorithm (Sickle, version 1.33) 23 using a quality threshold of Q20 (as opposed to Q30 22 ) and a length threshold of 150 nucleotides to filter out low quality reads/nucleotides. We the number of sequence errors was further reduced by applying an error correction algorithm (BayesHammer, SPAdes genome assembler toolkit, version 3.5.0) 24 . Next, reads were assembled into contigs (PANDAseq, version 2.9) 25, 26 and demultiplexed (Qiime version 1.9.1; split_libraries.py) 27 . We removed singleton sequences and identified chimeras using both de novo and reference chimera identification.

For this manuscript we therefore decided to test two carriage outcome variables on the basis of nasal washes from day 2, 7 and 9: 1) carriage2 outcome (based on pneumococcal detection using conventional culture only), 'carriers', with a culture positive sample at any point and 'non-carriers', who were culture-negative at all times; and 2) carriage3 outcome (combination of pneumococcal detection using both conventional culture and molecular techniques), coded as 'high-dense carriers' (culture-positive at any point), 'low-dense carriers' (qPCR-positive and culture-negative) and 'non-carriers' (qPCR-and culture-negative at every point). Initial explorative analyses demonstrated higher explanatory power of carriage3 outcome, i.e. the variable incorporating qPCR results.

Alternatively, we hypothesized and subsequently verified that these OTUs would demonstrate a strong negative association between (log10+1-transformed) raw read counts and (log10-transformed) bacterial density (linear model, beta-coefficient <-0.1 and p<0.05), indicating a larger impact of contaminating species on low density samples. We next screened the OTU-table using these criteria (considering only OTUs present in >30% of samples with a mean read count of 10) in an unsupervised manner, which resulted in a total of 24 unique, potentially contaminating OTUs. Plotting read counts of these OTUs in time suggested the existence of a batch effect, displaying several time intervals associated with varying degrees of contamination. We therefore ran a non-parametric change point analysis (changepoint.np package) to identify the cut-off points of these time intervals (i.e. the moments in time in which a shift in raw read counts was observed, hereafter referred to as 'change points'). Change points that were identified across \u22655 OTUs and thus were likely related to a consistent contaminating batch-effect, were selected and the OTUs in which any of these change points were identified (n=11) were adjusted. We first removed the negative correlation between raw read counts and bacterial density (selecting the residuals from a linear model fitted for each interval and OTU). These residuals (with mean=0) were then shifted to a new mean (y-axis translation) which was based on the (log10+1-transformed) read count mean within high density samples (upper quadrant), in which the amount of contamination was expected to be low/non-existent. This new baseline was adjusted for the total number of reads identified in each sample. ",

Stressvalues, which indicate how well the ordination captured the high-dimensional data (i.e. a measure of goodness-of-fit), were reported. We tested whether a nMDS-visualisation in a higher dimensional space would decrease the stress of the ordination using a scree plot (1-6 dimensions tested). However, since LAIV was allocated in a randomized manner and administered after baseline, this effect should not be tested for at this time point. At time points following pneumococcal inoculation we assessed the impact of carriage3 outcome (i.e. pneumococcal exposure/colonization) on nasal microbiota, adjusting for vaccination group, presence of any virus at baseline, the interaction between carriage2/3 outcome and both vaccination and the presence of any virus at baseline. We ran these tests both with and without the OTU representing S. pneumoniae (which was excluded before rarefactions) to quantify whether changes in overall microbiota composition were mainly driven by introduction of pneumococcus. P-values and R 2 -values accompanying nMDS-plots were based on the PERMANOVA-tests described above.",

Analyses were performed using PERMANOVA. For a detailed assessment on the association between baseline nasal microbiota and carriage 3 outcome, see Table 1 .

To assess the associations between nasal microbiota and pneumococcal carriage receptiveness and dynamics, while adjusting for potential variables of influence, we performed permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)-tests (adonis function of the vegan package; Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, 999 permutations). We ran these tests at baseline and for each time point following pneumococcal inoculation. At baseline, we included carriage2/3 outcome, month of sampling, the presence of any virus at baseline, the interaction between carriage2/3 outcome and both vaccination group and the presence of any virus at baseline. These interactions were included because especially for LAIV, an effect on carriage2/3 outcome may be expected, based on previous results 1,2 .",

Cluster membership in relation to 1) time point of sample collection, 2) vaccination group, 3) carriage3 outcome and 4) the per-sample microbiota profile (stacked bar chart of the 15 most abundant OTUs) was depicted in a dendrogram. Furthermore, the proportion of samples within each cluster at each time point was visualised for each carriage3 outcome using 1) stacked bar plots and 2) an alluvial diagram (ggvisSankey-function within the googleVis package) 41 . The stacked bar plots were used to visualise both the absolute number of samples that were binned to each cluster as well as the distribution of cluster memberships as a percentage of the total number of samples within each carriage3 outcome. Associations between cluster distribution and carriage3 outcome was assessed using Fisher's exact tests. A stratified analysis where clustering was based on baseline samples only, was performed to rule out potential confounding of these associations by profiles that emerge post-challenge. Microbiota change over time (focussing on the challenge interval spanning baseline to day 2) was assessed using 1) the number of cluster changes (e.g. from Stapylococcus [STA] to Moraxella [MOR]) vs the total number of cluster transitions per carriage3 outcome and 2) the change in Bray-Curtis dissimilarity per carriage3 outcome.",
