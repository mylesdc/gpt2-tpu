That is, the introduction of infection to a supercritical system results in a significant fraction of the population becoming infected only with a certain probability. Understanding the waiting time to the first major outbreak of an emerging disease is then more complicated than determining when the system becomes supercritical. We treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical. Specifically, we consider an SIR model with a time-varying transmission term and random infections originating from outside the population. We derive an analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in agreement with stochastic simulations. We find the key parameters to be the rate of introduction of infection and the rate of change of the basic reproductive ratio. These findings aid our understanding of real emergence events, and can be incorporated into early-warning systems aimed at forecasting disease risk.",

            "text": "The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases is an enormous concern to global public health. Nearly 70% of emerging human diseases have zoonotic origins [1] [2] [3] , including SARS [4] , MERS [5] , AIDS [6, 7] and Ebola [8] . Similarly, the re-emergence of previously controlled or eradicated diseases, including vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles [9] and pertussis [10] , continues to be a health and economic burden [11] . Owing to factors including reductions in vaccine uptake [12] , pathogen evolution [13] or changes in host demography [14] , emerging and re-emerging diseases make a transition from self-limiting, stuttering chains of infection (which inevitably go extinct), to sustained chains of human-to-human transmission (major outbreaks or epidemics). This critical transition becomes possible when the average number of infections caused by a single infectious individual in an entirely susceptible population (called R 0 ) becomes greater than 1-at this point the population is often referred to as supercritical [15, 16] . Forecasting this critical transition is the goal of earlywarning systems [17 -19] of disease emergence [12] . In addition to knowing when a population will become supercritical [12] , accurate forecasting also requires estimating the time of the first major outbreak or epidemic of a newly emerging or re-emerging disease. Crucially, major outbreaks do not happen immediately after R 0 \u00bc 1. Rather, they occur with some non-zero delay-for which we do not yet have an adequate theory.",

In this way, a substantial waiting time hides the true state of a system, inhibiting our ability to intervene in response to a large, but obscured, threat. Furthermore, long waiting times in disease re-emergence could mean that reversing the driver of a critical transition to its pre-outbreak levels might not push a pathogen's R 0 below 1. For instance, if reductions in vaccine uptake facilitate disease outbreaks (e.g. measles [20] [21] [22] ), increasing coverage to vaccination levels that existed immediately prior to an outbreak may not reduce R 0 below 1, because the transition to R 0 . 1 could have occurred well before the first major outbreak. An improved understanding of the factors determining the waiting time to a major disease outbreak will facilitate epidemic forecasting.",

Because of this influx, the expected number infected is necessarily greater than zero. However, the order of the expected number of cases changes qualitatively as the basic reproductive ratio passes through 1.

We make three modelling decisions to allow demographic stochasticity to have a substantial effect on delay times. First, the rate of birth in our model is always equal to the rate of death. Thus, the population size has no positive steady state, and the variance of the population size across multiple realizations of the model with the same initial population size increases over time. Second, the timing (s) of the increase in the transmission rate was set to year 100 to allow the variance to grow before the approach to the critical point even began. Third, the transmission rate is density dependent so that R 0 varies with fluctuations in population size (table 3) . Although frequencydependent transmission is the better supported model for many diseases of interest [25, 26] , the direct effect of demographic stochasticity on density-dependent transmission makes it more likely to cause behaviour different from our analytic model. As the purpose of the simulation was to investigate such behaviour, and essentially 'stress test' the analytic results, we present results based on density-dependent transmission in the main text. A comparison of these results with those of a frequency-dependent model is included in the electronic supplementary material.",

We parametrized models based roughly on the human lifespan, with a range of life-history parameters that correspond to several disease systems of emergence concern (table 2). To explore the range of possible solutions to the stochastic model, we ran 1000 stochastic simulations for each combination of parameter values. Each simulation ended at the first major outbreak, which occurred when three criteria were satisfied: (A) the size of the susceptible population was reduced below N/R 0 (after ffiffiffiffi N p (R 0 \u00c0 1) . 1, as it is difficult to distinguish epidemics from small outbreaks when R 0 is only just above 1), (B) at least 15% of the population was in the recovered class, and (C) at least 2.5% of the population was infected. These criteria ensured that the disease had surpassed the long-term, deterministic endemic equilibrium number of susceptible individuals (N/R 0 ) (i.e. a major outbreak occurred, A), that a substantial portion of the population had been exposed to the disease (B) and that the population was experiencing an active outbreak (C). We quantified bifurcation delay as the time between the deterministic tipping point of the system (calculated as the expected time when R 0 \u00bc 1, based on the initial population size N 0 and time-varying transmission rate b, table 3) and the last time point with 0 infectious individuals before the actual bifurcation (e.g. figure 1 ). To determine whether longer delays make outbreaks larger when they eventually occur, we also recorded the peak epidemic prevalence in each simulation.",

Recall that p \u00bc 2 corresponds to a Poisson distribution of secondary cases, whereas p \u00bc 0.5 corresponds to a highly overdispersed distribution of secondary cases. In the electronic supplementary material, we show that for all p the sensitivity of the mean and median to changes in either the sparking rate or the sweep rate depends only on the quotient of those two parameters. For relatively high sparking rates, the mean and median have a similar level of sensitivity to both parameters. As the sparking rate becomes relatively lower, the sweep rate becomes less important because for a broad range of rates the probability of an epidemic will be close to one by the time the first spark occurs. The level of heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases determines how quickly this transition happens by way of its effect on the relationship between R 0 and the probability of an epidemic. Overall, the analytic results provide a rather simple picture of the waiting times. However, in the rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160540 electronic supplementary material, we also show that the picture can be rather different if R 0 changes according to a step function instead of increasing linearly. For example, the median delay has the lowest proportional sensitivity to the sparking rate when the median delay just exceeds the time of the jump in R 0 . In the following, we explore the extent to which the picture changes due to the elements included in our more complicated simulation models. With data from stochastic simulations, we found mean bifurcation delay to decrease with increasing values of (i) sparking rate, (ii) population size, (iii) rate of increase in transmission, and (iv) infectious period (figure 2). These qualitative effects were not surprising, although the results highlight the importance of particular combinations of life-history traits. For instance, at a given value for the transmission rate's rate of change (a), different mean infectious periods (1/g) can lead to very different predicted and observed distributions of bifurcation delay (figure 2b-d ) because short infectious periods (i.e. high recovery rates) lead to lower sweep rates for a given value of a. The sparking rate and the sweep rate parameters of the analytic model are thus also important parameters of the simulated delay times. This parametrization also leads to a strong correlation of the delays of the frequency-and density-dependent models, although the delays of the frequency-dependent model are typically a little smaller (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ). Note that the sweep rate is independent of population size in the frequency-dependent model, so the relationship between life-history parameters and delay is highly dependent on the type of transmission.",

Consistent with the analytic results, increasing the sparking rate a increases the slope of the negative relationship between median simulation delays and the sweep rate ( figure 3 and table 4 ). However, for large a the elasticity for the simulated delays is much more negative than 20.5, which is the minimum possible value for our analytic model (electronic supplementary material).

Differences in predicted and observed delay distributions were greatest with slow sweep rates, fast recovery rates, high sparking rates and small population sizes (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). For a given combination of host and pathogen life-history parameters, longer delays give rise to larger outbreaks, because R 0 continues to increase ever-higher above the critical value of 1. Thus, a measles outbreak that occurs, by chance, 1 year after the population becomes supercritical will be larger, on average, than a measles outbreak that occurs six months after the population becomes supercritical (assuming the same underlying parameters). The slope of this relationship between delay and prevalence within a life-history parametrization depends on how quickly R 0 changes relative to the sparking rate (i.e. b/a, figure 4) . Note that the relationship between delay and prevalence does not necessarily hold across parameter combinations (i.e. when comparing different diseases; figure 4 ). Systems with shorter delays can have higher peak prevalence if they exhibit a longer infectious period, for instance, and thus a faster change in R 0 over time (which itself contributes to differences in mean delay).",

We have shown that even for models that include substantial demographic stochasticity, this delay is well described by a simple survival function with two parameters. One is the rate of transmission from outside of the population, which we call the sparking rate, and the other is the rate of change of R 0 , which we call the sweep rate.

The duration of bifurcation delay depends more on the sparking rate when the sparking rate is low (i.e. outbreaks are spark-limited), and more on the sweep rate when the sparking rate is high (i.e. driver-limited) (figure 3, see also electronic supplementary material). The degree of spark-or driver-limitation of a system reflects the size of disease outbreaks (figure 4). It may also determine the ability of early-warning systems based on critical slowing down to detect the tipping point at R 0 \u00bc 1 because a driver-limited system would likely experience a series of minor outbreaks before a major outbreak.

First, delayed emergence means host populations can be supercritical for extended periods of time without experiencing a major outbreak (e.g. figure 1 ). Stuttering chains of transmission do not necessarily indicate, then, that R 0 , 1. Without accounting for bifurcation delay, we might underestimate the likelihood of a major epidemic when transmission appears limited. This phenomenon is exhibited in many of our simulations, and is likely to occur in generic emergence time series with small clusters of cases followed by large, unexpected outbreaks. A major difficulty for disease risk assessment lies in determining whether a system with apparent subcritical transmission is truly subcritical, or actually supercritical and experiencing a delayed bifurcation.",

For instance, slow reductions in vaccine uptake that contribute to a major outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease are also subject to bifurcation delay [12] . Owing to the delay, control measures Table 4 . Scaling relationships between bifurcation delay and the sweep rate of the system. The left-most column is the linear slope of the relationship between log(delay) and log(sweep rate, b) for all simulations across all levels of the sparking rate a (e.g. solid black line in figure 3 ). All other columns show the slope of log(delay) by log(sweep rate) for each level of the sparking rate, a (e.g. colour lines in figure 3) . Observed values represent results from individual stochastic simulations, and expected values for the mean and median delay arise from our analysis based on a branching process model. We fitted general linear models to each to obtain estimates of explained While the effects of sparking (a) and the probability of an epidemic given a spark (which is governed by the sweep rate, b) on the duration of bifurcation delay are relatively intuitive, it is worth reiterating the importance of the terms that go into each. For instance, the absolute number of infectious imports for a given system may depend on population size (as in pre-vaccine era measles [39] ), which would have to be accounted for in any estimate of the sparking rate. On the other hand, unless the populations being modelled are very small (e.g. a school or village), frequency-dependent transmission is probably a better assumption for many diseases [25, 26] and so the sweep rate may be largely independent of population size. Nevertheless, the same rate of change in the transmission rate for two different diseases could still be consistent with different sweep rates and thus different expectations of delay, and even different sizes of eventual disease outbreaks. For example, differences in the infectious period of childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis could mean that a constant 1% reduction in vaccine uptake per year would result in earlier, larger pertussis outbreaks, because a longer infectious period (all else being equal) generally increases R 0 (figure 4).",

With this information and an estimate of the sparking rate from observed case data, future early-warning systems may be able to not only generate forecasts of when R 0 exceeds 1, but also produce distributions of likely waiting times to major outbreaks or epidemics (e.g. figure 2bd) . This approach could also be used in hindsight, in order to better assess the timing of when R 0 exceeded 1 to set the stage for previous epidemics.

Bifurcation delay can lead to epidemics with greater peak prevalence, although this effect depends on the life-history parameters of the system. Panels show peak epidemic prevalence by stochastic realizations of bifurcation delay (x-axis on log-scale). Symbols and line types represent three different infectious periods, approximating three important childhood diseases (5 days for measles, 9 days for chickenpox, 22 days for pertussis). Lines are loess smooths added for visual clarity. Colour represents the ratio of b to a, which describes how quickly R 0 changes relative to how frequently imported infections occur in a system. Symbols are positioned at the median of the x-and y-axes for each combination of life-history parameters. Panels show four different initial population sizes (N 0 \u00bc 500, 1000, 5000 and 10 000). The relationship between delay and peak infection prevalence depends on how quickly R 0 increases, which is governed by the sweep rate, mean infectious period and population size.
