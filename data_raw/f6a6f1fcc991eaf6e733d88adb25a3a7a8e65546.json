The genome type can be either DNA or RNA, single-or double-stranded and, in the case of a single strand, positive-or negative-sense. Retroviruses are considered a separate group that includes DNA-and RNA-encoded viruses. Altogether, this results in seven top-level classes. Lower-level groups comprise viral orders, families, sub-families, genera and species. Viruses with certain types of genome-encoding nucleic acid have been traditionally associated with different domains of life: Archaea and Bacteria usually harbor viruses with a DNA genome, whereas eukaryotes harbor RNA and retrotranscribing viruses. However, notable exceptions exist, and most viral genome types are spread across different domains. Generally, the similarity of sequences and virion structures is evident only up to the family level. In isolated cases, sequence homology can be detected between proteins of viruses with unrelated architecture, but it is unclear whether this can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer between ancestors of viral families or if this is a sign of a genuine evolutionary link, as discussed in great detail in [7, 8] and other related work. It is hypothesized that in certain cases, the conserved viral genes are witnesses of evolutionary processes as ancient as the origin of life itself [7] .",

            "text": "Another approach to the inference of viral phylogenies, capable of reaching into the distant past, is based on the comparison of the three-dimensional structures of viral capsid proteins [9] . It is well known that the three-dimensional structure of proteins is conserved over larger evolutionary distances than their sequences, and thus, several viral families can share a common fold of the capsid, although the sequences have diverged beyond similarity detection [8] . In certain cases, such viruses can be proven to have a common origin, particularly when the Baltimore class is also the same [10] , but the relatedness to viruses of a different Baltimore class is more difficult to establish [11] . Therefore, an alternative hypothesis of viral evolution has been proposed that considers the capsid as the central defining element of the viral evolution, and viruses are suggested to be called \"capsid-encoded organisms\" [12] . A comparison of capsid proteins allowed for proposing a novel classification of viruses into so-called lineages [13] . A lineage unites several viral families, whose capsid proteins have similar folds, but otherwise, their proteins can share little or no sequence similarity. Whereas the dimensions and subunit organization of the capsids can vary within the same lineage, virions often possess other common structural features, e.g., spikes attached to five-fold icosahedral vertices of the capsid [13] . Viral lineages also may share certain details of genome organization [14] .",

The major goal of the study was to detect the unlikely event of horizontal gene transfer between seemingly unrelated viruses. Through comparison of protein sequences, we have identified proteins from several protein families that appear in very distant viruses, with a conserved function, but with an origin that cannot be traced back to a single viral class, possibly pointing to several HGT events from the host. The sequence similarity in viral proteins quickly becomes undetectable with the increase of evolutionary distance. Here, we report an all-to-all comparison of the three-dimensional structures of viral proteins from different function classes that reveals many more relationships between proteins of viruses in different Baltimore classes, both structural and enzymatic. Overall, we detect two patterns in the evolution of viral proteins. Some protein families are populated by many viral proteins originating from species in different Baltimore classes and probably date back to ancient evolutionary events that led to a wide spread of certain folds in viruses. In other cases, only a small set of viruses harbor proteins similar to those from an unrelated family, in which case horizontal gene transfer events can be usually pinpointed, both between viruses and from host to virus.",

The corresponding amino acid sequences were clustered using CD-HITof the CD-HIT Suite web server [34] , and the structure corresponding to the longest sequence in each cluster was retained as its representative to yield a non-redundant set of protein structures with a sequence identity cut-off of 30%. This identity threshold was chosen because proteins with higher sequence identity have already been considered in the sequence analysis, so no significant hits can be lost in this way. The structural similarity between each pair of viral proteins was calculated using TMalign [35] and TM-score [36] , as well as the root mean square deviation of C \u03b1 atoms (RMSD) were calculated for each pair of structures. TM-scores were normalized by the length of the alignment. TM-scores are designed to be comparable among the alignments of different length, and a TM-score greater than 0.5 usually means that the proteins have the same fold [37] , so only these hits were retained. In contrast, RMSD depends on the length of the superimposed protein segments and thus is unreliable in large-scale comparisons. Again, we selected the pair where the proteins belong to viruses from different Baltimore classes. We performed visual inspection of the structural alignments to ensure their quality. To search for homologous structures in cellular organisms, the Protein Data Bank was scanned using the DALI [38] structure comparison server (Version 3), which provides a Z-score to measure the significance of the observed structural similarity. Structural similarities with a Z-score greater than two were considered significant. Similar structures were superimposed and displayed with UCSF Chimera (Version 1.10.2) [39] .",

Significant BLAST hits that met our criteria involved all Baltimore classes (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1 ) and comprised 143 protein pairs of 78 different proteins. For each hit pair, we searched the Pfam database [27] for the corresponding family by aligning both proteins to their HMM profiles, and in each case, both proteins turned out to belong to the same Pfam family. Hence, we refer to the hits using these family names (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1 ). One hit pair did not show significant similarity to any of the Pfam family. Since both proteins are annotated as hypothetical, we did not analyze this pair further. We also do not discuss the Parvo coat N family in detail, since the similarity is borderline in this case and does not allow for reliable phylogeny reconstruction.",

Next, we collected all viral sequences significantly similar to the HMM profile of the corresponding Pfam family and constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees with bootstraps. The analysis of these trees reveals two distinct patterns of the distribution of viral sequences: either sequences from viruses from two Baltimore classes are present in comparable and large numbers, and the bootstrap support values do not allow for distinguishing whether the parts of the tree covered by each Baltimore class are monophyletic (balanced distribution); or one or very few sequences from one Baltimore class cluster together on a single branch of the phylogeny with a good bootstrap support, and the rest of the tree is interspersed with sequences from viruses from the other Baltimore class (unbalanced distribution). We will consider now each of these scenarios in detail and discuss the possible evolutionary implications.",

In RdRPs, the functional motifs are also well conserved. An exception is presented by RNA helicases of Circoviridae, where a critical lysine in motif A can be replaced by an arginine or a glutamine [41] . In the Cryspoviruses RdRPs, the functional motif F likewise contains a substitution of a lysine by a glycine, which may have an impact on the binding of the metal ions and, hence, modify the catalytic function of the enzyme [42] . However, judging from the genome composition, both proteins appear to be fully functional in their respective species.

Viral proteins reside on separate branches of the phylogenetic tree with a high bootstrap support. The conservation of the viral sequences is lower that of their cellular counterparts, namely of the two functional motifs [45] covered by the considered alignment; motif V (following the notation of [45] ) is poorly conserved. Nevertheless, the catalytic arginines in motif VI are well conserved. Branches corresponding to dsDNA viruses are colored red, ssDNA viruses green, positive-strand RNA viruses blue, ssRNA viruses cyan, proteins from cellular organisms in black and internal branches that do not lead to proteins from monophyletic clades in gray. Functional motifs and catalytic sites are presented in sequence logos and protein 3D structure, where appropriate (discussed in the text). dUTPases are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA [46] . These proteins are also present in a large number of dsDNA viruses from Herpesvirales, Poxviridae and various bacteriophages. Each of the viral families resides on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree; however, the bootstrap support of these branches is low. In certain cases, there is significant sequence identity between the viral protein and the dUTPase from its host, e.g., Orf virus dUTPase is 72% identical to the human dUTPase and has a GC content that is closer to that of human than of the virus itself (0.552 for the Orf virus dUTPase, 0.554 for human, 0.854 for Orf virus), suggesting recent HGT from human to virus. The bifunctional nucleocapsid-dUTPase protein from Mason-Pfizer monkey Betaretrovirus (MPMV) and protease from simian retrovirus exhibit significant sequence similarity to this family; and the MPMV protein has been proven to be an active dUTPase [47] . Phylogenetically, they are distinct from other viral dUTPases with a high bootstrap support and are most closely related to endogenous retroviruses from placental animals (Figure 2A ). The five functional motifs described for dUTPases [46] are well conserved in the viral proteins, which suggests the enzymatic function to be conserved. Thus, we can reasonably assume that dUTPases of dsDNA and retroviruses were obtained through independent evolutionary events, but were recruited to serve the same function in different viral groups.",

The structures of the capsid, matrix and envelope proteins and of the viral enzymes were collected from Protein Data Bank [33] in January 2015 and grouped into different datasets according to their biological function, based on their annotation. For each dataset of proteins, sequences with greater than 30% sequence identity were clustered together, since such proteins are almost always homologous and, hence, have very similar three-dimensional structures [58] . We compared the three-dimensional structures of proteins representing each cluster and calculated RMSD and TM-scores [35] for structural alignments. Although intuitive, RMSD is a poor measure for comparing structural similarity across different protein folds: it depends on the length of the aligned regions, in that small protein segments tend to be aligned with smaller RMSD than large and complex structures. Nevertheless, the structural similarity of large protein fragments bears more evolutionary information. TM-score, in contrast, is devoid of these weaknesses and was normalized by the alignment length. It has been shown that TM-scores greater than 0.5 almost always correspond to the alignment of structures with a similar fold [37] .",

The average TM-score within positive-strand ssRNA viruses is similar to that between negative-strand ssRNA and positive-strand ssRNA viruses and is 0.67. The structural similarities ( Figure 3C ) detected among these proteins are in agreement with the similarities previously reported between flaviviruses and alphaviruses and the proposed evolutionary link between Bunyaviridae and Flaviviridae [65] . This fold is structurally similar to cell-cell fusion protein EFF-1 from C. elegans, although sequence homology is not detectable (DALI Z-scores between 4.9 and 12.3, RMSD between 2.9 \u00c5 and 12.1 \u00c5, sequence identity between 5% and 9%, Supplementary Figure S2 ).

All of these enzymes have an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Thus, we extend the set of related RdRPs identified by sequence comparison. No structural homologs of RdRPs have been found among the proteins from cellular organisms, in agreement with their unique function in RNA viruses. Here, we show that sequence-structure homology spans all classes of RNA viruses. RdRPs from dsRNA and positive-strand ssRNA viruses have previously been reported to be related [67] . Now with resolved three-dimensional structures of RdRPs from negative-strand ssRNA viruses emerging [68] , one can argue that RdRPs from RNA viruses share a common fold. This agrees with an earlier hypothesis that negative-strand ssRNA RdRPs evolved from positive-strand ssRNA virus RdRPs [7] . RdRPs from Eukaryota have been reported, but they are structurally distinct, showing more similarity to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases [69] .",

In particular, M48, ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 that has a dsDNA genome, shows similarity with proteases of viruses with positive-strand ssRNA, e.g., the papain-like protease of SARS coronavirus, the leader protease of the foot and mouth disease virus, strain O1 (Aphthovirus), the papain-like protease 2 of equine arteritis virus and the papain-like cysteine protease of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Sequence similarity searches deliver no clues about the evolutionary history of these proteases. Indeed, homologs of the protease of the SARS coronavirus can be found in a variety of beta-and gamma-coronaviruses, while the homologs of leader protease of the foot and mouth disease virus can be found only within the genus of Aphthovirus and of the ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 in a small set of cytomegaloviruses. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, these proteins share the same papain-like fold. A search for structural similarities with DALI [38] revealed the presence of structural homologs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms that suggests gene transfer events (Supplementary Figure S4) . The fact that each viral protease is more similar to proteases from vertebrates than to other viral proteases might suggest multiple introduction events from the host. Nevertheless, the existence of considerable tertiary structural similarity between different papain-like proteases, whose sequence similarity is not detectable, might point to structural convergence events. The low sequence similarity, non-conserved gene context and the absence of a reliable evolutionary model precludes us from suggesting a definitive evolutionary scenario. Further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the origin and evolution of proteases with a papain-like fold in viruses.",

            "text": "From 12 methyltransferases, we detect structural similarity between mRNA cap methyltransferases of viruses with dsDNA genome (Vaccinia virus) and positive-strand ssRNA genome (SARS coronavirus and Wesselsbron virus) ( Table 2 ). The superposition of these three structures reveals significant structural similarity, especially between the methyltransferases of the SARS coronavirus and the of Vaccinia virus that have different genomes (Table 2 and Figure 4B) . A cellular homolog of the methyltransferase from SARS coronavirus can be found in E. coli with 65% sequence identity and an e-value of 1e-138, and viral homologs are detected in numerous coronaviruses. The homologs of methyltransferase from Vaccinia virus can be found in several other poxviruses, while the homologs of the Wesselsbron virus are restricted to flaviviruses. However, no sequence homology between these three groups is detectable. On the other hand, structural similarities can be observed between these enzymes and methyltransferases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and may suggest gene transfer events (Supplementary Figure S5) . Again, the viral proteins are more similar to eukaryotic methyltransferases than to each other, which suggests multiple introduction events from the host. The host range for all three viruses coincides with the species of the closest non-viral structural relative. Similarly to what was previously suggested for the evolution of viral papain-like proteases, we cannot exclude that the structural similarity observed between methyltransferases of different viruses and viral and some cellular methyltransferases is the result of convergent evolution events. The second group of structurally-similar envelope proteins comprises glycoproteins belonging to negative-strand ssRNA viruses (Asian influenza, a subtype of influenza A, influenza B virus strain B/Memphis/13/03, influenza C virus strain C/Johannesburg/1/66) and to betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family with positive-strand ssRNA genome (Table 2 and Figure 4C ). The Asian influenza and the influenza B virus glycoproteins are hemagglutinins, proteins mediating the viral fusion with the host cell membrane, while the glycoproteins of influenza C and that of betacoronavirus are hemagglutinins with an additional esterase domain (hemagglutinin esterases). Similarity between hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and influenza C virus is detectable already on the sequence level, as discussed above, but does not allow for resolving the direction of the gene transfer. Additionally, hemagglutinin esterase of Torovirus (also from Coronaviridae), whose structure is unknown, is similar to these two with sequence identity of about 30%. Structural similarities were previously reported between hemagglutinins of influenza A, B and C in the HA2/HEF2 chain. Similarity between the hemagglutinin esterases of coronaviruses and orthomixoviruses has been reported to be a result of lateral gene transfer events [72] . However, the direction of the transfer has not been analyzed in the original report. Taking all of the data together, we can propose that the transfer happened from influenza C virus after its split from influenza A and B around 8000 years ago [73] , either to one of the Coronaviridae genera and then from there to the other or to both of them independently ( Figure 5 ). Since the hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and Torovirus are more similar to each other than to the respective spike glycoproteins, introduction into a common ancestor of Coronaviridae and subsequent loss in all other genera is unlikely.

It is generally assumed that viruses are polyphyletic. Nevertheless, some key viral proteins, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, appear to be related in very large groups of viruses, possibly all RNA viruses [7] . It has even been proposed that all positive-strand ssRNA viruses and some dsRNA viruses have a common origin [74] . Another line of evidence shows that some dsRNA, positive-strand ssRNA and dsDNA viral families share a common capsid structure [75] . The concept of viral hallmark genes has been proposed [7] to denote genes, and consequently proteins, that are shared by many diverse groups of viruses, have only very distant homologs in cellular organisms, are monophyletic within each group of genes and thus can be used to define an entity as a virus. However, these insights are related to only a few, although very important, viral proteins and are largely achieved through careful manual analysis. In this work, we have developed a procedure that requires minimal manual intervention to explore all possible candidate proteins that are common in at least two different Baltimore classes and thus are either viral hallmarks or have some other interesting evolutionary history. The fact that we recapitulate all known viral hallmark genes that can be found in more than one Baltimore class proves the validity of our approach. Some of the viral hallmark genes have been discovered only by comparing protein structures, which stresses the necessity of this type of analysis.",

A sequence comparison identifies all known members of each protein family, whereas structural comparison provides information on distant homologs and sometimes allows one to resolve evolutionary events. It must be noted that the number of resolved three-dimensional structures of viral proteins lags far behind the number of available sequences of them, and in the light of the new developments in the field of next-generation sequencing, this gap can be expected to be growing.

In the latter case, HGT can often be proposed. When comparing protein sequences, we call the first pattern \"balanced sequence distribution\" and the second pattern \"unbalanced sequence distribution\". Since the sequence homology is in all cases evident, we can be sure that we deal with a monophyletic protein family and, hence, use phylogenetic analysis and discuss the evolutionary events that happened in that family. In the comparison of protein structures, we set the algorithm parameters such that we discover proteins that have the same fold according to the CATH [76] classification or the same fold in SCOP [77] . The common ancestry of such proteins is likely, but not necessary, so we refrain from calling these grouping protein families. Instead, we use terms \"widely represented folds\" and \"confined fold\" for the two patterns mentioned above. It must be noted that beside proteins with homologs in cellular species, all other families with balanced sequence distributions and widely represented folds correspond to viral hallmark genes.

The first group of methods is based on the analysis of a reliable phylogenetic tree of the protein family: any event in this tree that contradicts the species tree is a candidate for HGT [79] . The second group of methods relies on the analysis of the sequence statistics and special features that can be evidence for HGT if not typical for the considered species [80] [81] [82] . The simplest, but practical statistical measure is the GC content of the corresponding nucleotide segment. Application of these different tools to the identification of HGT events in viruses encounters difficulties, both rooted in the methodology and caused by the biology of the subject.",

In the absence of a common evolutionary tree for viruses beyond their immediate families, phylogeny-based methods for HGT detection are inapplicable. Sequence statistics also does not offer a reliable tool, since the transferred segments can adjust very quickly to their new background. In fact, the only case, when the GC content analysis reliably supports HGT, involves DNA phages (OrfB IS 605 family) or dsDNA poxviruses (dUTPase of the Orf virus). Given the indications that HGT in viruses is quite common, at least in some clades, such as NCLDV [21, 83] , there is a great need to develop alternative strategies that do not rely on sequence comparison. In the presented work, we investigate all cases available to us of significant sequence and structural homology.",

Additionally, structural analysis led to new findings, e.g., it allowed us to identify an interesting example of envelope glycoproteins that are related to a cell-cell fusion protein and also resolve the evolutionary history of hemagglutinin-esterase introduction into Coronaviridae. These few examples hint at the potential multitude and scale of these events, which can be only fully appreciated if more data on three-dimensional structure of viral proteins become available, which may paint a much more complex picture of viral evolution than previously expected.",
