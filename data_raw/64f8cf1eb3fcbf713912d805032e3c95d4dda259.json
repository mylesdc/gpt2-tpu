These include bioimaging, gene diagnostics, analytical sensing, photothermal treatment of tumors, and targeted delivery of various biomolecular and chemical cargos. For the last-named application, gold nanoparticles should be properly fabricated to deliver the cargo into the targeted cells through effective endocytosis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding the selective penetration of gold nanoparticles into immune cells. The interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cell receptors is discussed. As distinct from other published reviews, we present a summary of the immunological properties of gold nanoparticles. This review also summarizes what is known about the application of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant in immunization for the preparation of antibodies in vivo. For each of the above topics, the basic principles, recent advances, and current challenges are discussed. Thus, this review presents a detailed analysis of data on interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells.",

Indeed, as early as in the \ue103rst attempts to investigate colloidal gold biodistribution, which were performed in the 1960s-80s on rabbits, 8 mice, 9 and rats 10, 11 it was found that a\ue09der parenteral administration, colloidal gold particles are captured by liver cells, excreted through bile, and eliminated from the organism with feces. A\ue09der injection, gold was identi\ue103ed mostly in Kupffer cells. Perhaps Scott et al. 8 were the \ue103rst to note that the phagocytosis of GNPs is size dependent. Besides Hardonk et al., 10 the important role of Kupffer cells in the elimination of GNPs was established by Sadauskas et al., 12 who injected GNPs intravenously in mice. Electron microscopy showed that a\ue09der injection, the GNPs accumulated in the macrophages of the liver (90%) and spleen (10%). The authors concluded that GNPs penetrate only phagocytes, primarily the Kupffer cells of the liver. In a subsequent study, 13 Sadauskas et al. reported that GNPs get localized in lysosomes (endosomes) of Kupffer cells and can be retained there for up to six months. The in\ue104uence of size, solubility and surface modi\ue103cation on the biocompatibility of GNPs and their use in biological applications is well known. 14, 15 However, the effects of nanoparticle properties on the immune system are still being explored.",

            "text": "The immune system cells constitute the \ue103rst barrier to nanoparticle penetration of animal tissues and cells. Therefore, the study of GNP interactions with phagocytes, the mechanisms of intracellular uptake, and the responses of immune cells to GNPs is undoubtedly of major interest. Perhaps the \ue103rst detailed consideration of these issues can be found in Shukla et al., 16 who, using three microscopic methods, examined the uptake of 3 nm GNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The conclusion from their study was that small GNPs enter macrophages through pinocytosis and get localized mostly in lysosomes and in the perinuclear space. On the whole, Shukla et al.'s data indicate that the GNPs are biocompatible, noncytotoxic and nonimmunogenic and that they suppress the production of reactive oxygen species and do not cause elaboration of the proin\ue104ammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL1-b (which contradicts the data of Yen et al. 17 ). In contrast to data by Shukla et al., 16 Yen et al. 17 noted that on the administration of GNPs, the number of macrophages decreases and their size increases, this being accompanied by elevated production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a. We emphasize that the data of Shukla et al. 16 were obtained for very small (3 nm) particles. However, Lim et al., 18 using much larger (60 nm) hollow NSphs capped with dextran, and Zhang et al., 19 using 60 nm GNPs, achieved results similar to the \ue103ndings of Shukla et al. 16 for the same cell culture. Sumbayev et al. 20 showed that citrate-stabilized GNPs speci\ue103cally downregulate, in a size dependent manner, the cellular responses induced by IL-1b both in vitro and in vivo. In a recent study, Guev\u00e9l et al. 21 demonstrated that 12 nm gold nanoparticles induce cell mediated responses accompanied by in\ue104ammatory natural killer (NK) cell stimulation, whereas 2 nm gold nanoparticles are more efficiently taken up without inducing dendritic cell maturation or lymphocyte proliferation. To summarize, the published data revealed strong effects of the GNP size and functionalization on production of proin-\ue104ammatory cytokines.",

From their results, it follows that indeed, on entry into murine bone marrow macrophages, GNPs do not affect the production of proin\ue104ammatory cytokines. However, if the GNP surface is modi\ue103ed with the peptide AGIP (amyloid growth inhibitory peptide, LPFFD) or SAP [sweet arrow peptide, (VRLPPP) 3 ], GNPs, on entry into the macrophages, involve the induction of NO synthase and proin-\ue104ammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6. In addition, they inhibit macrophage proliferation. The recognition of GNP-peptide conjugates was made more effective through toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) on the surface of the macrophages. Yet, Staroverov et al. 28, 29 demonstrated that both 15 nm nonconjugated GNPs and their conjugates with highand low-molecular-weight antigens, on entry into rat peritoneal macrophages, enhance their respiratory activity and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 1 ). GNPs also have greatly increased the production of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-g (Fig. 2 ). Lee et al. 30 reported that the penetration of gold nanorods (GNRs) and SiO 2 -coated GNRs into macrophages induces the release of in\ue104ammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins, etc.) and the activation of immune response genes. Thus, in addition to early observations by Shukla et al. 16 for bare GNPs, the published data [26] [27] [28] [29] indicate a signi\ue103cant role of surface coating in macrophage response a\ue09der GNP uptake.",

As in the usual cellular uptake, immunoactivity depends strongly on the particle size: 5 nm particles conjugated with disaccharides performed far better than smaller, 2 nm ones. 35 Yet another means of activating macrophages with GNPs was proposed by Wei et al. 36 For this purpose, they used 15 and 30 nm GNPs conjugated to cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides. As is known, these oligonucleotides are demethylated sites of microbial DNA that can activate macrophage immune response by interacting with the TLR-9 receptors and subsequently triggering a cascade of immune response signals. The immunostimulating activity of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs may be analogous to that of oligonucleotides from bacterial DNA. 37 According to Wei et al., 36 GNP-CpG conjugates were effective in enhancing nanoparticle internalization in RAW264.7 macrophages, and they greatly increased the secretion of proin\ue104ammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 (15 nm conjugates did so to a greater degree than 30 nm ones did). The immunostimulatory effect of GNP-CpG was much greater than that of native CpG at the same concentrations.",

Particle size also affected serum protein adsorption through a change in the steric interactions between the PEG molecules.

In fact, it is the GNP-protein corona that forms the \ue103rst nano-bio interface and determines the \ue103rst interactions of GNPs with/or within living cells. This is because the GNP-protein corona is a dynamic biopolymer layer that can strongly affect cellular uptake owing to modi\ue103cation of the particle properties (the overall size, charge, etc.). Although as much as 69 plasma proteins can bind to the GNP surface, 44, 45 only some of them, such as albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, complement and \ue103brinogen, are the most abundantly bound proteins forming the GNP-protein corona. A\ue09der intravenous injection, the coating of GNPs by these proteins largely determines the particles' fate in the body-biodistribution over organs, tissues and cells, the efficiency of cellular uptake and clearance, immunological properties, and so on. 46, 47 Ma et al. 48 showed that GNPs attenuate LPS-induced NO production through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kB and IFN-b/STAT1 pathways in RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, Liu et al. 49 demonstrated that PEGylated GNPs were internalized more quickly by lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells than by unstimulated cells, reaching saturation within 24 h. The PEGylated GNPs enhanced LPS-induced production of NO and IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in RAW264.7 cells, partly by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-kB pathways. Goldstein et al. 50 showed that GNPs and their plasmonic excitation could activate the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in macrophages.",

In the past decade, dendritic cells have attracted increased interest owing to the ease of their isolation from peripheral blood monocytes and to their ability to effectively present antigens to T cells. By now, a great deal of work has been done on the modulation of immune response in patients with chronic infections and oncological diseases by using antigen-primed dendritic cells. 52 GNPs have been named, among other carriers, for application in antigen delivery to dendritic cells. For example, Cheung et al. 53 described the use of 15 nm GNPs for presenting a peptide antigen associated with Epstein-Barr virus to dendritic cells. According to their TEM data, peptide-functionalized GNPs penetrated the dendritic cell cytoplasm but were not found in the nuclei. The uptake of GNPs by dendritic cells resulted in an increased content of g-interferon, the presentation by major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) of the antigen to CD4+ T cells, and, correspondingly, activation of an epitope-speci\ue103c immune response by cytotoxic T cells.",

A characteristic fact is that the \"professionally\" phagocytic cells took up GNPs two orders of magnitude more effectively than did, e.g., HeLa cells.

            "text": "Since the 1920s, the immunological properties of colloidal metals (in particular, gold) have been attracting much research interest. This interest is mainly due to the physicochemical (nonspeci\ue103c) theory of immunity proposed by J. Bordet, who postulated that immunogenicity, along with antigenic speci\ue103city, depends predominantly on the physicochemical properties of antigens, \ue103rst of all on their colloidal state. L. A. Zilber made successful attempts to obtain agglutinating sera to colloidal gold 76 (interestingly, a repeated attempt to prepare antisera to colloidal gold was performed almost 80 years later, in 2006). 77 Yet, several authors have shown that the introduction of a complete antigen together with colloidal metals promotes the production of antibodies. 78 Furthermore, some haptens may cause antibody production when adsorbed to colloidal particles. 79 Numerous data on the in\ue104uence of colloidal gold on nonspeci\ue103c immune response are given in one of the best early reviews. 80 In particular, it was noted that at 2 h a\ue09der an intravenous injection of 5 mL of colloidal gold into rabbits, there was a sizable increase in total leucocytes in 1 mL of blood (from 10 000 to 19 800) against a slight decline in mononuclear cells (from 5200 to 4900) and a considerable increase in polynuclear cells (from 4700 to 14 900). 81 On injection of other colloidal metals, no such phenomena were observed. Unfortunately, with advances in immunology and with denial of many postulates of Bordet's theory, interest in the immunological properties of colloids decreased. There is no doubt, though, that the data obtained on the enhancement of immune response to antigens adsorbed on colloidal particles were utilized for the development of various adjuvants. 82, 83 The size-dependent GNPs-induced changes (both increasing and decreasing) of the number of white blood cells have been reported in several recent publications. [84] [85] [86] It is known that antibody biosynthesis is induced by substances possessing sufficiently developed structures (immunogenicity). The substances include proteins, polysaccharides, and some synthetic polymers. However, many biologically active substances (vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, narcotics, etc.) have relatively small molecular masses and, as a rule, do not elicit a pronounced immune response. In standard methods of antibody preparation in vivo, this limitation is overcome by chemically attaching such substances (haptens) to high-molecular-weight carriers (most o\ue09den proteins), which makes it possible to obtain speci\ue103c antisera. However, such antisera usually contain attendant antibodies to the carrier's antigenic structures. 87 Let us take a brief look at two interrelated problems in current immunology that have attracted much research attention. These are the development of antibodies to nonimmunogenic low-molecular-weight compounds (haptens) and the creation of next-generation vaccines based on natural (microbial) or synthetic peptides. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] It is known that antibody biosynthesis is induced by substances possessing sufficiently developed structures (immunogenicity). These substances include proteins, polysaccharides, and some synthetic polymers. 94 However, many biologically active substances (neurotransmitters, hormones, vitamins, antibiotics, etc.) have relatively small molecular masses. Low-molecular-weight antigens are in the category \"weak antigens,\" i.e., they do not elicit a pronounced immune response.",

            "text": "Because haptens are weakly immunogenic, the choice of an optimal carrier (delivery system) providing a high immune response, in parallel with the obtainment of pure enough antibody preparations, is an important task when producing antibodies to low-molecular-weight compounds. Traditionally, this problem is solved by chemical attachment of a hapten to a protein matrix called a schlepper (from the German schleppen \"to drag\"), and by the use of adjuvants and intensive schemes of animal immunization with the obtained conjugate. 87, 95 Bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, thyreoglobulin, hemocyanin and diphtheria or tetanus toxoids (in the case of synthetic peptides) are generally used as schleppers. However, this method yields antibodies to both the hapten and the immunodominant sites of the carrier. Note that when such a carrier is used, a pronounced immune response to weak antigens does not always develop. Besides, the subsequent puri\ue103cation and screening of the obtained antibodies are laborious and expensive, and their titre and affinity are o\ue09den low. Most currently used adjuvants based on oil emulsions and on suspensions of inorganic substances are, as a rule, liable to phase separation, are o\ue09den reactogenic, and their immunogenic properties vary with time. Many of these adjuvants cause local and systemic toxicity. 82 In recent years, efforts have been made to develop \"complex antigens\", i.e., arti\ue103cial molecular complexes formed from both necessary antigens and carriers or/and adjuvants. In particular, synthetic polyelectrolytes (poly-L-lysine, polyacrylic acid, polyvinylpyridine, sulfonated polystyrene, \ue103coll, etc.) were proposed for use as adjuvants. 96 These polymer compounds are produced by chain-radical polymerization of the corresponding monomers. The simplicity of polyelectrolyte composition and synthesis, the possibility of obtainment of polymer chains with a wide range of molecular masses (i.e., of various lengths), their solubility in water, and other properties (the capacity for conformational transitions, the formation of complexes with proteins, etc.) opened up possibilities for the use of polyelectrolytes in immunologic investigations. Such adjuvant carriers are capable of antigen deposition at the sites of injection, enhancement of antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells, and induction of production of necessary cytokines. However, the low immunogenicity of such complexes, due to their small epitope density, prompts researchers to look for new nontoxic and effective carriers additionally possessing adjuvant properties.",

Also, for GNP-assisted antigens, several groups reported new administration ways: oral, pulmonary, transcutaneous and transmucosal immunization.

            "text": "A considerable number of papers devoted to the use of GNPs for creating DNA vaccines have emerged as well. The principle of DNA immunization is as follows: gene constructions coding for the proteins to which one needs to obtain antibodies are introduced into an organism. If the gene expression is effective, these proteins serve as antigens for the development of an immune response. 181, 182 In the early papers, immunization was conducted by a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of a \"naked\" DNA. However, for this purpose, a \"biolistic\" transfection, using GNPs, began to be applied almost simultaneously. It was found to be very effective, apparently because of the multiplicity of sites of transgene interaction with tissues and because of transgene penetration directly into cells and nuclei. 183, 184 The method of gene immunization, o\ue09den called DNA vaccination, which was well-developed in experiments with animals, has shown high efficiency especially in respect of viral infections: tick-borne encephalitis, HIV infection, hepatitis B, and some others. 185 DNA immunization has some advantages over routine vaccination. A single recombinant vector can govern the synthesis of several antigens simultaneously, reducing the number of separate immunizations. This results in erasing problems connected with the difficulties of protein penetration into the organism and in reducing signi\ue103cantly the risk of side effects, which depend on the toxicity of the contaminant proteins introduced during a routine immunization or on the virulence of the bacteria and viruses used. One can expect that DNA immunization will be among the most effective genetherapy methods in the coming years. [186] [187] [188] Recently, intramuscular injection of a \"naked\" DNA was abandoned in DNA vaccination. Investigators have come to use nanoparticles as a carrier for genetic material and to introduce the injection substance subcutaneously, intracutaneously, epicutaneously and intranasally. [189] [190] [191] Among the nanoparticles used as DNA carriers, GNPs, both spherical and cylindrical (multivalent Au-Ni nanorods), are especially popular with researchers. [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] Besides DNA, polysaccharides, peptides and glycopeptides are used as vectors in such vaccines. 53, [199] [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] Moreover, whereas gold was earlier used only as a carrier, Zhao et al. 206 noted: \"Although the mechanism behind this is not well understood, it appears that gold cartridges might enhance immune responses in vivo\".",

That GNPs act as both an adjuvant and a carrier (i.e., they present haptens to T cells) seems the most interesting aspect of manifestation of immunogenic properties by colloidal gold. In particular, GNPs conjugated to antigens were found to in\ue104uence the activation of T cells: a tenfold increase in proliferation, as compared with that observed on the addition of the native antigen, was found.

The in\ue104uence of dendritic cells on the development of immune response upon injection of a GNP-conjugated antigen was discussed by Vallhov et al. 217 In addition, those authors noted that when using nanoparticles in medical practice, one has to ensure that there are no lipopolysaccharides on their surface. Similar results, for the interaction of GNPs with macrophages, were reported by Kingston et al. 218 The interaction of cells of the immune system with GNPs was very actively examined by Dobrovolskaia's group. 72, 73, 75, 102, 219, 220 According to them, nanoimmunology is a new promising and rapidly developing \ue103eld.

According to the current view, 94 the presentation of an antigen to T cells is preceded by its processing, i.e., cleavage into peptide fragments followed by the formation of bonds with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, which transport the antigen fragment to the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. It remains unclear, then, how this process can proceed with a hapten. The hypothesis of the multivalent antigen, i.e., the antigen formed because of the high local concentration of univalent antigens on the surface of a gold particle, does not answer this question either. Hypothetical mechanisms of the immunomodulatory effects of nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 8 and 9 . 234, 235 Recently, many papers have been published in which the problems associated with GNP use for targeted drug delivery were discussed.

Keeping in mind the recent data for the low toxicity of GNPs and their efficient excretion by the hepatobiliary system, we expect that both nanoparticle classes -GNPs and biodegradable nanoparticleswill compete on equal footing for the development of next-generation vaccines.",

The activation of immune cells by GNPs, shown by several authors, may serve as a basis to develop new vaccine adjuvants. As in the case of the usual cells, interactions with various types of receptors on the surface of immune cells and, correspondingly, various types of GNP endocytosis depend largely on the surface functionalization of GNPs. Many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. However, the interaction of functionalized GNPs with cells of the immune system is still far from being understood in more or less detail and requires further study. 236 In conclusion, it may be said that the time is probably right to talk of not only the biochemistry but also the biophysics of immune response, because it is the unique biophysical properties of metallic particles-in particular, the surface charge and the electrostatic \ue103eld of the particle (in\ue104uencing, in a certain manner, the charge, orientation and polarization of the antigen molecules adsorbed on the particles)-that have to signi\ue103cantly affect the immune-response process.",

In addition, the immunogenicity of CNPs is determined by the physicochemical properties of particles such as size, shape, charge and surface functionalization. Study of the immune response characteristics when using GNPs as a carrier and adjuvant for the production of antibodies will allow evaluating their potential for the development of effective vaccines.",
