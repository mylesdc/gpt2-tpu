However, infectious diseases represent the biggest obstacle to successful development of this business. Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) infection alternatively known as duck virus enteritis (DVE), or duck plague (DP) [2] , is one of the most widespread and devastating diseases of waterfowls in the family Anatidae and has severally affected the waterfowl industry since the early 1900s because relatively high mortality could be observed and a wide host range including domestic [3] and wild ducks [4, 5] , geese and swans of all species as well as other birds like coots are susceptible. Furthermore, serious carcass condemnations and decreased egg production were also observed in affected waterfowls. Like other herpesvirus-induced diseases, AHV-1 infection has latent form and the virus can be persistently shed by birds that recover from the disease [6] . This complicates the control of the disease, particularly under small-holder farming conditions prevalent in China.",

Fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) technique has eliminated the need of sample post-amplification handling required by the conventional PCR assay and has paved the way towards fully automated detection systems now that they usually display very high sensitivity and broad dynamic capacity after optimization [10] [11] [12] . Since virus load and proliferation dynamics serve as indispensable indicators of virus-host interaction, antiviral evaluation, active/ latent infection [13] [14] [15] and guidance for therapeutic intervention, FQ-PCR is therefore of paramount importance by its exquisite virus detection and monitoring ability [16] .",

Ten-fold dilution series of pAHV-1 plasmid standard DNA were tested by the established real-time PCR assay to evaluate the sensitivity of the system and the detection limit was found to be 1.0 \u00d7 10 1 copies/reaction. Comparisons were made between conventional PCR and the established FQ-PCR using dilution series to calculate the end point sensitivity of each assay. The results indicate that the established FQ-PCR is around 100 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR method, detecting pAHV-1 down to dilutions of 1.0 \u00d7 10 1 , compared to dilutions of only 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 for conventional PCR.",

Since titration of the virus load is labor-consuming and requires about 5 days for evaluation of virus-induced CPE, distinguishing between virus-induced CPE and non-specific cell alterations may be difficult, the established real-time PCR assay will be particularly suitable in these studies.

When all these different practical refinements are combined, the final result is a molecular diagnostic method that is not only rapid and reliable, but one that is also easy to perform and applicable to use for testing large numbers of samples since the FQ-PCR presented the benefits of increased speed due to reduced cycle time and remove of post-amplification process, offering considerable labor savings and allowing higher throughput analysis than conventional PCR assays and thus is favorable for the transition of this method from research to routine use in laboratories.

In addition, the sensitivities of the conventional PCR and FQ-PCR were each determined using triplicates of different concentrations of recombinant plasmid pAHV-1. Template DNA was prepared as follows: plasmids of pAHV-1 were diluted serially in 10-fold steps from 10 10 copies/\u03bcL to 10 1 copies/\u03bcL using sterile ultra pure water. One microliter from each dilution was used as template and subjected to the conventional PCR and FQ-PCR protocol respectively. The detection limit of the conventional PCR was determined based on the highest dilution that resulted in the presence of clear and distinct amplified fragments (498 bp) on the agarose gel. The detection limit of the FQ-PCR was determined based on the highest dilution that resulted in the presence of CT value in real-time PCR detection. Within-run and between-run reproducibilities of the FQ-PCR assay were assessed by multiple measurements of pAHV-1 samples of different concentrations. The assay was conducted by assessing the agreement between the replicates in five replicates (within-run precision) and in five separate experiments (between-run precision) of the serially diluted pAHV-1 recombinant plasmid samples through performing analysis of the mean coefficient of variation (CV) values of each AHV-1 standard dilution.",
