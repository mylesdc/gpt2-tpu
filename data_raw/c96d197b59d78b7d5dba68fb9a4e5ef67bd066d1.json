Here, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were cloned and identified for the first time. The two proteins share the same topological structure and several important sites critical for the antiviral functions in other species are conserved in the goose. Goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 are most closely related to their respective orthologs in ducks; these proteins exhibited high mRNA transcript levels in immune-related tissues, including the thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and Harderian gland, compared to other tissues. Moreover, goose IFITM1 was highly constitutively expressed in gastrointestinal tract tissues, while goose IFITM3 was expressed in respiratory organs. Furthermore, goose IFITM3 was activated in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Tembusu virus (TMUV) or treated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonists, while only the R848 and Poly (I:C) agonists induced significant upregulation of goose IFITM1. Furthermore, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were upregulated in the sampled tissues, to some extent, after TMUV infection. Notably, significant upregulation of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 was detected in the cecum and cecal tonsil, where TMUV was primarily distributed. These data provide new insights into the immune effectors in geese and promote our understanding of the role of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in the defense against TMUV.",

            "text": "Recently, IFITMs have become a popular research topic with the discovery that the immune-related IFITMs (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) inhibit the early replication of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . IFITMs are a subfamily of a larger transmembrane protein family called Dispanins [9] , which are generally considered to be comprised of IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 [10] . IFITM4P, a pseudogene, is located on mouse chromosome as IFITM6 and IFITM7 [11] . Moreover, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, as viral restriction factors, are known as immune-related IFITMs, the antiviral activity of which is conserved from prokaryotes to vertebrates. In addition, the immune-related IFITMs exhibit high constitutive expression in target cells and are strongly induced by types I and II IFNs [12] . IFITMs have common domains that consist of N-and C-termini, two transmembrane domains, and a conserved cytoplasmic domain and share common properties: (1) the proteins contain a CD225 domain composed of transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) and a cytoplasmic domain and (2) two exons encode transmembrane polypeptides [13] . Among these domains, the N-terminal region plays an important role in the correct cellular localization of IFITM3. Removing the N-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 results in a loss of association with the endosomal compartments and relocation to the cell surface, thereby abrogating its antiviral function [14] . IFITM1 possesses a shorter N-terminal region and predominately localizes at the cell periphery and in early endosomes [4] . The different cellular localization of IFITM1 and IFITM3 likely underlies their diverse antiviral efficiency against various viruses [15] . IFITM1 exerts more resistance to viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane or early endosome, such as HIV-1 [8] . However, IFITM3 is more proficient than IFITM1 at preventing infection by the late endosomal-or lysosomal-entering viruses, including IAV and DENV [3] . At present, IFITMs have been widely identified in vertebrates, and homologs of IFITMs are even found in bacteria [16] . However, little attention has been paid to IFITMs in birds. Only a small number of bird IFITM sequences have been deposited in public databases, including Gallus gallus IFITM1-like (GenBank: XM_001233949), Anas platyrhynchos IFITM1 (GenBank: KF584226), Gallus gallus IFITM3-like (GenBank: XM_420925), Anas platyrhynchos IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584228), Serinus canaria IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009102512), and Nipponia nippon IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009463652). In addition, it was reported that chicken IFITM3 [17] and duck IFITM3 [18] could restrict influenza viruses, but information regarding goose IFITMs was unavailable.",

The TMUV genome is a single-stranded RNA with an open reading frame that encodes three structural proteins, namely, the core (C), membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins, and seven nonstructural proteins [20] . In China, the virus was initially isolated from ducks and can cause severe egg drop syndrome in laying ducks, resulting in huge economic losses. However, recent studies showed that chickens, geese, and house sparrows are also susceptible to this virus [21] [22] [23] . Most importantly, serum samples from workers in the duck industry contained TMUV antibodies, which may indicate potential zoonotic transmission [24] . In view of the significant antiviral activity of IFITMs in the IFN-mediated innate antiviral defense and the lack of studies focusing on avian IFITMs, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were cloned for the first time. In addition, the amino acid sequences and topological structures of these proteins were predicted. To understand the evolutionary relationship of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Moreover, the tissue distribution of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 in healthy geese was identified. It has been demonstrated that IFITMs play an important role in blocking the entry of pathogenic flaviviruses such as DENV and WNV.",

Subsequently, the full-length cDNA of IFITM3 and the 5 -untranslated region (UTR) of IFITM1 were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Briefly, the gene-specific primers (GSPs), including 5 GSP0, 5 GSP1, 5 GSP2, 3 GSP1, and 3 GSP2, were designed based on the obtained partial sequences. For 5 -RACE, a homopolymeric tail was added to the 5 -end of the synthetic cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and dCTP (TaKaRa, Japan), and then the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the primer 5 GSP0 and a HiScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, USA).

IFITM3-like (GenBank: XM_420925) and chicken IFITM1like (GenBank: XM_001233949) were renamed chicken IFITM1 and IFITM3, respectively. In addition, the names of the previously identified duck IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584228) and duck IFITM1 (GenBank: KF584226) were reversed. The pairwise sequence alignment analysis of nucleotide sequences showed that goose IFITM1 shares a much higher identity with its counterparts in duck (GenBank: KF584228) (93.3%) and chicken (GenBank: XM_420925) (70.6%) than with duck IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584226) (63.5%) and chicken IFTM3 (GenBank: XM_001233949) (59.4%). A similar result was observed in the nucleotide sequences alignment of goose IFITM3 with chicken IFITM1 and IFITM3, as well as duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Table S2 ). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the IFITM1 and IFITM3 clusters were divergent subgroups. Goose IFITM1 and the renamed chicken IFITM1 and duck IFITM1, together with the mammalian IFITM1, were classified into the same subgroup. Meanwhile, goose IFITM3 and the renamed duck IFITM3 were located in the same monophyletic group, which was closely related to the renamed chicken IFITM3. In summary, the results revealed that it was necessary to rename the IFITM1 and IFITM3 in chicken and duck and that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 have been conserved during evolution. The minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C), which is equivalent to the N-terminal 21-amino acid-truncated IFITM3, was strikingly enriched in patients who were severely infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus [35, 41] . In line with the above findings, VSV-G envelope proteinmediated virus entry could not be inhibited by the IFITM3 mutant (the N-terminal 21-amino acid deletion) [14] . These results highlight the important role of the N-terminal region of IFITM3 in antiviral functions [14] . In addition, the 20-Yxx\u03a6-23 sorting signal in the N-terminal region is critical for the internalization of IFITM3 from the cell periphery to endosomal compartments where it acts to impede virus entry [42] . The N-terminal Yxx\u03a6 motif was observed in the N-terminal region of goose IFITM3. We predicted that the conserved motif in goose IFITM3 is also involved in the internalization and antiviral actions. Moreover, three other Yxx\u03a6 motifs that might be required for the endosomal localization and antiviral functions of duck IFITM3 [18] are also conserved in IFITM3 of chickens and geese. However, whether these Yxx\u03a6 motifs in goose IFITM3 are critical for correct cellular localization and inhibition of virus entry has yet to be confirmed.",

In addition, the expression of goose IFITM1 was restricted and primarily confined to the gastrointestinal tract tissues (cecum, small intestine, and gizzard), which was observed previously in both chickens [17] and ducks [18] . In contrast, goose IFITM3 was constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Notably, high expression levels of goose IFITM3 were observed in respiratory tract tissues (lung and trachea), the target tissues of infection with influenza A viruses, compared to the other tissues, which might contribute to the inhibition of influenza A virus replication [43] . It is notable that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 both exhibit the lowest levels of expression in muscle tissues, similar to observations in chickens [17] .",

R848, Poly (I:C), ODN 2006, and LPS are known as TLR7, TLR3, TLR21, and TLR4 agonists, respectively.

However, the available information on whether IFITMs positively respond to TMUV infection is scant. Obviously, the expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 displayed an upward trend in all the tested tissues, especially the cecum (Figure 7) , where TMUV was primarily distributed (Figure 8 ). High viral copy numbers were also observed in the intestinal tract tissues of TMUV-infected ducks [48] . In addition, goose IFITM1 was intensively transcribed in the TMUV-infected spleen and thymus (Figure 7) , where the significant upregulation of the IFNs was previously observed [48] . After TMUV infection, the virus was intensively located in the collected tissues, which reasonably explains why higher expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 appeared in the TMUV-infected gosling tissues than those of the mock-infected group. In addition, the lowest viral copy numbers were seen in lung tissues, which might be attributed to the high expression level of IFITM3 in the TMUV-infected goose lungs. In light of the positive response of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 to TMUV infection, we speculate that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 might facilitate IFN-mediated defenses against TMUV.",
