In the present study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was chosen as a model organism, and modified broth microdilution was applied for the determination of the fluorescence absorption values to calculate the anti-MRSA activity of BAs. We have initiated four steps to seek the optimal combination of BAs that are (1) determining the anti-MRSA activity of single BA, (2) investigating the two-component combination to clarify the interactions among BAs by checkerboard assay, (3) investigating the multicomponent combination to determine the optimal ratio by quadratic rotationorthogonal combination design, and (4) in vivo and in vitro validation of the optimal combination. The results showed that the interactions among BAs are related to their concentrations. The synergetic combinations included \"berberine and epiberberine, \" \"jatrorrhizine and palmatine\" and \"jatrorrhizine and coptisine\"; the antagonistic combinations included \"coptisine and epiberberine\". The optimal combination was berberine : coptisine : jatrorrhizine : palmatine : epiberberine = 0.702 : 0.863 : 1 : 0.491 : 0.526, and the potency of the optimal combination on cyclophosphamide-immunocompromised mouse model was better than the natural combinations of herbs containing BAs.",

Rhizoma Coptidis has been used for more than two thousand years in China, and it was known as \"the antibiotics in traditional Chinese medicine\". Although many studies were conducted on antimicrobial activities of berberine alkaloids (BAs) in the past few decades [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , few of them paid attention to the interactions among BAs. As we know, BAs are the active components of several traditional medicines, such as Rhizoma coptidis, Phellodendri Chinensis, and Berberidis Radix [8, 9] , and the awareness of the interactions among BAs is of great value for the exploitation of such multicomponent drugs.",

Single-drug treatment modalities have slowed down into bottle neck, alternatively the multi-component natural medicine might be one of the directions of the future antibacterial drug development [15] .

Among these methods, checkerboard 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine microdilution is one of the commonly used assays for twocomponent combinations that can quickly screen the antimicrobial activity [16] . The detection sensitivity of this method could be much improved by adding the fluorescent dye of resazurin, which makes it an accurate method for determining the anti-MRSA activity of BAs. However, checkerboard microdilution is not suitable for the investigation of multicomponent combinations, and hence the quadratic rotationorthogonal combination design (QRCD) was adopted to seek optimal combinations. Compared to unifactor experiment and orthogonal design, QRCD basically retained the advantages of less experiments, simple calculation and absence of the correlation between regression coefficients. In addition, the optimal region of the concentration could be directly obtained [17, 18] . This study can help to clarify the interactions among BAs and provide a new idea for the exploitation of multi-component drugs.",

Fluorescence intensity was determined 17 h after the experiment (when the fluorescence intensity peaked). The concentrations of the extracts of BAs were 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, and 4 g/mL for rows 1-10, respectively. Rows 11 and 12 were set as infected control (containing bacteria but no extract) and noninfected medium control (containing neither extract nor bacteria). Following fluorometric measurement, the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) was calculated using the fluorescence intensity of rows 1-10 and the infected control.",

However, to our knowledge, there have not been any reports on the combinations of ingredients in traditional medicine. The present study showed that alkaloids had anti-MRSA activity, but the activity was relatively weak compared with antibiotics. The reason might be that the bacteria had multiple drug resistance which resulted in low absolute concentration inside the cell membrane. Bacteria have evolved numerous defenses against antimicrobial agents, and drug-resistant pathogens are on the rise [35] .

Compared with these methods, QRCD presents two features: (1) it sacrifices partial orthogonality to obtain rotatability, and it retains the merits of less test times, simple calculation, and low dependency among the regression coefficients; (2) it discards the disadvantage of lacking rotatability that cannot screen the optimal regions from predicted values. The results of this section were consistent to the results in 3.2. Figure 7 showed that the optimal combination in 3.3 had the strongest inhibiting effects on E. coli, S. aureus, S. dysenteriae, and S. pneumonia. Specifically, the EC 50 of geometric proportion of alkaloids on E. coli was 1.81 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of Berberidis Radix on S. aureus was 1.74 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of geometric proportion of alkaloids on S. dysenteriae was 1.59 times larger than that of the optimal combination; the EC 50 of Berberidis Radix on S. pneumonia was 1.41 times larger than that of the optimal combination. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the optimal combination on C. albicans ranked second only to Rhizoma Coptidis. The results indicated that the optimal combination was not only applicable for ATCC43300, but also other laboratory strains.",

Two-Component Combination Assay.Drug interactions generally consist of synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects[40]. The interactions among BAs are marked by 6 color gradations, among which purple indicates strong antagonistic effect, orange indicates slight antagonistic effect, dark blue indicates additive effect, light blue indicates slight synergistic effect, brilliant yellow indicates strong slight synergistic effect, and green indicates strong synergistic effect. The results showed two regularities. Firstly, the interactions among BAs were related to their concentrations, and the interactions changed along with the change of the concentrations (Figures 5 and 6). For example, while the concentration of Ber was 310.5 g/mL (EC 50 ) and the concentration of Epi was 266.4 g/mL (1/4 EC 50 ), 1065.4 g/mL (EC 50 ), or 4261.6 g/mL (4 EC 50 ), the excess over HAS > 20% and the excess over Bliss > 10%; while the concentration of Ber was 19.4 g/mL (1/16 EC 50 ) and the concentration of Epi was 66.6 g/mL (1/16 EC 50 ), the excess over HAS = \u22127% and the excess over Bliss = \u22126%. Secondly, different BAs showed different interactions; specifically, the combinations of Ber and Epi, Jat and Pal, Jat and Cop, Cop and Epi showed intensive synergistic effect within the test concentrations (MICs and FICIs were determined, and the result showed a synergistic effect on inhibiting CP with FICI < 0.5 or 0.5 < FICI < 1).By combining HAS and Bliss additivism models, it can, to a large degree, avoid false-positive results. There are a number of algorithms for quantifying synergy in the screening experiments. For example, median effect and isobolographic analyses effectively identify combinations in which one drug enhances the potency of the other drug. From the 36-point dose matrix, it was illustrated that the interactions of BAs were relevant to the proportion of each component. For example, the combination Ber & Epi showed strong synergistic effect while the proportion of Ber was 20%; the combination Pal & Epi showed obvious antagonistic effect while the proportion of Pal was 20%. The interactions among the drugs are the foundation of exploiting multicomponent drugs, and the development of such drugs should retain synergistic",

Establishment of an Antibacterial Mouse Model.The efficacy of the synergistic pairs was tested in a living immunocompromised animal model. We developed an immunocompromised mouse model by i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide at a dosage of 100 mg/kg (body weight) once daily for 3 consecutive days to specific pathogen-free female ICR mice. To test the model with pathogens, mice were infected with 0.1 mL of MRSA suspension of 2 \u00d7 10 5 blastospores per mouse in warmed saline (35 \u2218 C) by the lateral tail vein on day 3 after pretreatment with CY. We succeeded in causing 100% mortality within 6-8 days, which was suitable for subsequent drug-evaluation experiments. To test whether the BAs combinations had synergistic effects in the CYimmunocompromised mouse model, the test compound(s) either alone or in combination were administered orally by gavage 6 h postinfection and once daily thereafter for 5 days. A control group received 0.1 mL of saline by the same route as the placebo regimens.
