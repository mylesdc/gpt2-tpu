We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1 19, is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemiological studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.",

This has given great impetus to the idea of a multiantigen vaccine as an intervention strategy against blood-stage malaria. Therefore, the selection and prioritization of candidate antigens are critical aspects of this strategy. Although several blood-stage antigens have been extensively studied, few have demonstrated the desired qualities for a vaccine candidate. One of the remarkable observations from the P. falciparum genome sequencing project was that nearly 60% of the parasite' s genes lacked sequence similarity to genes from other known organisms, and thus these genes have remained hypothetical with no defined functional roles [13] . Subsequently, the availability of more comprehensive genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic datasets from both humans and Plasmodium has paved the way for further characterization of these hypothetical proteins using informatics-based approaches. This is required for successful identification of a repertoire of novel P. falciparum merozoite antigens that could be explored as targets for a rational vaccine design [14] .",

Plasma antibodies from children in Accra and Navrongo showed no reactivity to the R1 peptide beyond background (normal human serum [NHS]) levels, whereas those from Kintampo were only slightly above background; however, this difference was statistically significant (P = .04) ( Figure 4A ). Plasma samples from all 3 sites appeared to recognize all 3 PfSRA peptides, and all groups showed reactivity above background levels ( Figure 4B -D). Statistically, these differences in reactivity against PfSRA P1 were significant compared with NHS for plasma from Navrongo (P < .0001) and Accra (P < .0001) but not Kintampo ( Figure 4B ). Reactivity for PfSRA P2 was significant compared with NHS for plasma from Kintampo (P < .0001) and Accra (P = .004) but not Navrongo ( Figure 4C ). However, the reactivity against PfSRA P3 was significant for all 3 sites (Kintampo, P < .0001; Navrongo, P = .02; and Accra, P < .0001) ( Figure 4D) . Pre-immune A, PfSRA possesses a signal peptide and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Cut-1 and -2 represents PfSUB-1 cleavage sites analyzed by the Prediction of Protease Specificity tool. Cut-3 represents the GPI-transamidase cleavage site for the predicted GPI attachment signal. PfSRA P1, PfSRA P2, and PfSRA P3 designate conserved regions of PfSRA in different orthologs that possesses coiled-coil signatures for which chemically synthesized peptides were designed. C designates the carboxyl terminus, and N designates the amino terminus. B, \u03b1-PfSRA antibodies detect multiple processed fragments of native PfSRA during immunoblotting of 3D7 ring-stage invasion supernatants (ISs) that were probed with mouse \u03b1-EBA-175 (R217) antibody (I), rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA P1 antibody (lot no.: A417040387) (II), \u03b1-PfSRA P2 antibody (lot no.: A417040332) (III), and \u03b1-PfSRA P3 antibody (lot no.: A417040334) (IV). The colored bars at the far right represent the predicted processed fragments (70, 58, 32, and 17 kDa) (V). C, Anti-PfSRA antibodies detect multiple processed fragments of native PfSRA during immunoblotting of 3D7 parasite culture supernatants (CSs) that were probed with preimmune sera (I), \u03b1-PfSRA P1 antibody (II), \u03b1-PfSRA P2 antibody (III), and PfSRA P3 antibody (IV). D, Anti-PfSRA antibodies detect multiple processed fragments of native PfSRA during immunoblotting of 3D7 schizont lysates (SLs) that were probed with preimmune sera (I), \u03b1-PfSRA-P1 antibody (II), \u03b1-PfSRA-P2 antibody (III), and PfSRA-P3 antibody (IV).

Because all 3 PfSRA peptide antibodies were inhibitory at higher concentrations (100-750 \u03bcg/mL) (Supplementary Figure 6A and 6B) , we have shown that, whereas the preimmune sera and a control immunoglobulin G (IgG) did not inhibit parasite invasion at lower concentrations (25-75 \u03bcg/mL), \u03b1-PfSRA antibodies exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of parasite invasion ( Figure 7A ). Of all 3 of the PfSRA peptide antibodies tested, only \u03b1-PfSRA P1 antibodies showed 60% inhibition of parasite invasion at 75 \u03bcg/mL. As a control, anti-Basigin antibodies showed 75% inhibition of parasite invasion at 10 \u03bcg/mL ( Figure 7A ). To exclude the possibility that serum contaminants might be interfering with parasite invasion, we generated antibodies against a shorter construct of R1-peptide using the same purification procedures for \u03b1-PfSRA peptide-specific antibodies, and no inhibition of parasite invasion was observed ( Figure 7A ). Because all 3 \u03b1-PfSRA antibodies were inhibitory at 100-750 \u03bcg/mL, we tested combinations of \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies against 3D7 and observed that this strategy did not greatly impact on parasite invasion inhibition ( Figure 7B ).

Using Bioinformatics and data-mining analysis of published P. falciparum transcriptomes and proteomes [24, 25] , we identified PfSRA to be reminiscent of a surface protein, defined by the presence of a signal peptide and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment signal [28, 29] . Indeed, PfSRA has been shown to have PfSUB-1 cleavage sites that were assigned using the Prediction of Protease Specificity analysis platform [25] . The presence of these proteolytic cleavage sites in PfSRA may allude to processing events occurring prior to invasion of erythrocytes. Besides, proteolytic processing in the malaria parasite has been shown to be relevant for cascades of interaction occurring at the parasite-host cell interface [21, 30] . Furthermore, because orthologs are good candidates for multispecies vaccines, we generated sequence alignments with other PfSRA orthologs, which showed that the C-terminus of PfSRA has 5 positionally conserved cysteine residues across the different species orthologs. Our attempt to express the recombinant PfSRA that possesses 67% unstructured regions was unsuccessful. Similarly, others have attempted the expression of the mature recombinant PfSRA in HEK293E cells using a codon-optimized gene (Geneart) and have also been unsuccessful [28] . Considering that PfSRA is an asparagine-rich protein with numerous potential N-linked glycosylation sites, we did not attempt expression in insect cells because the system produces proteins with more complex N-linked glycosylation [31] that may not present the relevant sugar epitopes of native glycosylation [32] . Therefore, the challenges associated with the expression of recombinant PfSRA necessitated the design of chemically synthetized peptides for an epitope-based vaccine strategy.",

Interestingly, these domains have been evaluated as potential targets for peptide-based vaccines [38] [39] [40] . The 3 PfSRA peptide antibodies from rabbits specifically detected breakdown products of native PfSRA in ring-stage invasion supernatant or parasite culture supernatant and schizont lysates. This indicated that PfSRA synthetic peptides are antigenic mimics of the native parasite protein. Our data showed that PfSRA is postsynthetically processed by cleavage into parasite culture supernatant, and this is consistent with the PfSUB-1 cleavage sites it harbors. The merozoite surface is remodeled by a series of proteolytic processing events; the physiological relevance of these events in the malaria parasite remains poorly described. However, there are reports suggesting that proteolytic processing may result in activation, structural rearrangement, or acquisition of other new functional properties of native parasite proteins [41] .",

Consistent with this observation is a previous report that \u03b1-PfMSP1 19 antibodies were carried into invaded erythrocytes, disrupted intra-erythrocytic development, and inhibited erythrocyte invasion [42] [43] [44] . Although the molecular mechanism underlying the internalization of antibodies remains debatable, it was suggested that the tight junction between the merozoite and the erythrocyte might consist of transient interactions that allow the passage of antibodies or surface proteins [19] . Because all rabb3it \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies recognized different PfSRA polypeptide fragments in ring-stage invasion supernatant or parasite culture supernatant and schizont lysates at varying thresholds, it was expedient to investigate whether processing could influence differential subcellular localization of PfSRA in the parasite. Interestingly, all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies showed circumferential association on the merozoite surface at the timing of schizont rupture and merozoite release. Similarly, we performed colabeling in IFAs with gametocytes (stage II-V) using all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies with the gametocyte surface marker Pfs48/45. A clear, punctate rim-fluorescence pattern was observed for all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies that appeared to colocalize with Pfs48/45 in a stage-dependent manner based on the colocalization coefficient. Therefore, the consistency in the staining patterns of all 3 rabbit \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies in both asexual and gametocyte stages suggested that proteolytic processing of PfSRA does not cause changes in the subcellular localization of the protein. Although the distribution of proteins in male or female gametocytes could be linked to functional divergence between the sexes [45] , we observed the expression of PfSRA in both male and female gametocytes. Consistent with this observation is an existing report on Plasmodium berghei gametocyte egress and sporozoite traversal protein (PbGEST) expression in both sexes [46] .",

Our serological screens, buttressed by immuno-dot blot assays, with plasma samples from malaria-infected children residing at different endemic sites showed differences in total IgG recognition frequencies for PfSRA peptides. This could be linked to varying transmission intensity rates as reported for samples collected from different endemic sites in previous studies [33, 47] . In most cases, the reactivity of all 3 PfSRA synthetic peptides was low, and the likely explanation for this could be the hindered accessibility of PfSRA in the native context. However, our data from IFAs showed that the immuno-affinity purified, human \u03b1-PfSRA peptide antibodies labeled native PfSRA, which suggests that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA.",

Notably, neuraminidase removes sialic acids from glycophorins, trypsin cleaves peptide backbones of several receptors (glycophorin A, glycophorin C, and complement receptor 1), and chymotrypsin cleaves glycophorin B and complement receptor 1, among others [48] . We have shown that the 32-kDa-processed fragment of native PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes, but the molecular identity of the receptor remains unknown. However, we have classified the putative receptor for PfSRA as sialic acid-dependent on the basis of its binding specificity, which is sensitive to treatments with both neuraminidase and trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin, a binding phenotype that fits the description of the receptor glycophorin C. The enzyme sensitivity profile of PfSRA binding to erythrocytes is similar to that observed for PfEBA-140 (region II), the parasite ligand for glycophorin C [49] . Additional investigations are required to determine whether PfSRA also interacts with glycophorin C, possibly via a different binding site.",
