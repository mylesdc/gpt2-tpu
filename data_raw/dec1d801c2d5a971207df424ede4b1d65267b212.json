Recently, a small overlapping coding sequence, termed pipo, was found to be conserved in the genomes of all potyvirids. PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional \"A\" inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is~2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence. While utilization of transcriptional slippage is well known in negative-sense RNA viruses such as Ebola, mumps and measles, to our knowledge this is the first report of its widespread utilization for gene expression in positive-sense RNA viruses.",

            "text": "The family Potyviridae encompasses around 30% of known plant virus species and causes more than half of viral crop damage worldwide [1, 2] . The family comprises the genera Potyvirus, Rymovirus, Bymovirus, Ipomovirus, Tritimovirus, Macluravirus, Poacevirus and Brambyvirus, with genus Potyvirus containing the most species. Family members have single-stranded monopartite positive-sense RNA genomes except in the genus Bymovirus where the genome is bipartite. The genomic RNA has a covalently linked 5 0 -terminal protein (VPg) and a 3 0 poly(A) tail. Subgenomic transcripts are not produced [3] . Until recently, all the viral proteins were thought to be encoded within a single open reading frame (ORF) (or one ORF per segment in bymoviruses) that is translated as a polyprotein and cleaved to produce the mature virus proteins. However, it is now thought that all potyvirids contain an additional coding ORF, termed pipo, that overlaps the P3-encoding region of the polyprotein ORF in the \u00c01/+2 reading frame (Fig 1) [4] . PIPO is expressed as part of a larger product that was hypothesized to comprise the N-terminal part of P3 (termed P3N) fused to PIPO via either translational or transcriptional frameshifting [4] . This hypothesis was further supported by the detection of products of appropriate sizes for P3 and P3N-PIPO with antibodies to N-terminal epitopes in P3 [5, 6] . Frameshifting was proposed to occur at a GAA_AAA_A sequence (underscores separate polyprotein-frame codons) at the 5 0 end of the pipo ORF that is highly conserved among Potyvirus species (Fig 1) . Members of other Potyviridae genera have similar homopolymeric runs of \"A\"s at the same site (Appendix Dataset S1). The frameshift product P3N-PIPO plays an essential role in cell-to-cell movement, and mutations within this motif result in a movement-deficient phenotype [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

In eukaryotic systems, efficient \u00c01 PRF normally requires a \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequence where the shift in reading frame takes place, and a 3 0 -adjacent stimulatory element which normally comprises an RNA stem-loop or pseudoknot structure separated from the slippery heptanucleotide by a \"spacer\" region of 5-9 nt [10, 11] . The consensus motif for the slippery heptanucleotide is X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX normally represents any three identical nucleotides; YYY represents AAA or UUU; Z represents A, C or U; and spaces separate zero-frame codons [12] . In the tandem slippage model, the P-site anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX, whereas the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY, allowing for perfect repairing except at the wobble position [13] . Because the codon:anticodon duplex in the P site is not monitored so strictly as that in the A site, certain deviations from the canonical XXX of the slippery site are tolerated, including GGU, GUU, GGA and GAA [10, 12, 14] .",

In several single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses, such as members of the genus Ebolavirus and the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, the viral polymerase can stutter at a defined site to insert one or more additional nucleotides into a proportion of mRNA transcripts [19] . Stuttering involves realignment between the template and nascent RNA strands in the polymerase and preferentially occurs on homopolymeric runs, especially those comprising \"A\"s or \"U\"s. In the paramyxoviruses, stuttering occurs on a 3 0 -U n C m -5 0 (n + m \u2265 8) motif in the negative-sense template and results in the insertion of one or more additional \"G\"s in the positive-sense (5 0 -A n G m -3 0 ) mRNA for the phosphoprotein gene. In paramyxoviruses, directionality is provided by the ability of RNA to form G:U pairs, but not A:C pairs. In ebolaviruses, stuttering occurs on a run of 7 \"U\"s in the negative-sense template to insert one or more additional \"A\"s in the positive-sense mRNA for the glycoprotein gene. However, transcriptional slippage was not considered an obvious explanation for pipo expression because of the short length of the conserved homopolymeric run (just 6 \"A\"s), and because the conserved 5 0 \"G\" (resulting in a 3 0 -CU 6 -5 0 sequence in the negative-sense template, opposite in orientation to the paramyxovirus 3 0 -U n C m -5 0 stuttering site) appeared to favour nucleotide deletions over insertions, and two deletions (or one insertion) would be required to provide access to the pipo ORF.",

We performed mutational analyses of the GAA_AAA_A sequence and investigated the mutant phenotypes. Finally, we performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA derived from virus infections. We found that an extra \"A\" is inserted into the GA 6 sequence in approximately 2% of TuMV transcripts, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO.

            "text": "To investigate the potyvirus frameshifting mechanism, we used a GFP-expressing infectious clone of TuMV (TuMV-GFP; Fig 1) . To enable efficient detection of both P3 and P3N-PIPO with the same antibody, we inserted a sequence encoding the V5 epitope to tag both the P3 and P3N-PIPO proteins near to their N-termini (Fig 1) . The V5 tag was stably maintained within the virus genome for at least four passages. Using a V5 antibody, it was possible to detect both P3 and P3N-PIPO in protein extracts from upper leaves of plants following inoculation of lower leaves with TuMV-GFP via agroinfiltration (Fig 2) Genetic analysis indicates that \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting is not the primary expression mechanism for P3N-PIPO in TuMV A highly conserved GAA_AAA_A sequence at the 5 0 end of the pipo ORF was proposed previously to be the site of frameshifting [4] ( Fig 1) . In TuMV, the motif is preceded by a \"G\", to form a G_GAA_AAA_A sequence that might be compatible with \u00c01 PRF to access the pipo ORF ( Fig 3A) . On the other hand, conservation of the final \"A\" would not be relevant for \u00c01 tandem slippage PRF but would be relevant for transcriptional slippage. To further elucidate the frameshifting mechanism, several mutants were constructed ( Fig 3A) . Mutants M1 and M2 carry mutations 5 0 -adjacent to the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible \u00c01 PRF by preventing P-site codon:anticodon re-pairing following a \u00c01 shift. Mutant P has mutations at the 3 0 end of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible transcriptional slippage by reducing the length of the homopolymeric run of \"A\"s. Mutant FSko has mutations in the middle of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that should inhibit frameshifting by either mechanism. All the mutations listed above were introduced into the TuMV-GFP cDNA with V5-tagged P3 (denoted WT) and do not change the P3 amino acid sequence.",

For WT virus, GFP fluorescence became easily detectable from 4 to 5 d.p.i. in clusters of cells, indicating virus cellto-cell movement. Cell clusters typically reached approximately maximum size and signal intensity by day 6. Similar cell-to-cell movement was seen with mutants M1 and M2. In contrast, with To ensure that the movement-deficient phenotype of P and FSko was not simply an artefact of defective virus replication (with GFP fluorescence observed in single cells resulting from translation of RNA transcribed directly from the plasmid), these mutants were tested for their ability to replicate within cells. Mutants were introduced into plants by agroinfiltration (Fig 4) . A replication-deficient TuMV-GFP clone, \u0394GDD, lacking the catalytic GDD site of the viral polymerase, was constructed and used as a control. Using strandspecific RT-PCR, the positive-strand viral RNA (derived from T-DNA transcription and/or viral replication) was, as expected, detected with all constructs: \u0394GDD, WT, P and FSko. However, when strand-specific RT-PCR was used to detect the negative-strand viral RNA, which can only be produced by the viral polymerase during viral replication, cDNA fragments were detected only for WT, P and FSko, indicating that mutants P and FSko are replication competent. Viral protein accumulation was also analysed. P3 and CP were detected by Western analysis in total protein extracts from patches infiltrated with \u0394GDD, WT, P and FSko. Comparison of protein levels indicated that mutants P and FSko do not accumulate as efficiently as WT virus, though this might be an artefact of the assay as WT virus would reach more cells whereas the movementdeficient mutants would only replicate and accumulate in transformed cells. As expected, much lower levels of P3 and CP were detected in patches infiltrated with the \u0394GDD mutant, consistent with transcription and translation of the T-DNA encoded sequence, without viral replication. In summary, the mutants unable to move from cell to cell (P and FSko) are still able to replicate and accumulate, supporting the proposition that the movementcompromised phenotype results from the absence or insufficient expression of P3N-PIPO.",

Primers designed to anneal just upstream or downstream of the GA 6 sequence were used to reverse transcribe and amplify a region surrounding the GA 6 site, and the resulting cDNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (Fig 5, Appendix Table S1 ). Around 1.9-2.1% of reads obtained from total RNA purified from WT TuMV systemically infected leaves contained a single \"A\" insertion within the GA 6 sequence (GA 6 changed to GA 7 ), thus allowing expression of P3N-PIPO at a level of~2%, consistent with Western blots of V5-tagged virus (Fig 2) . A single \"A\" insertion was the most abundant insertion/deletion event detected. Similar results were obtained with TuMV mutants M1 and M2, with 2.3-1.8% of reads containing a single \"A\" insertion. Polysomal and virion RNA (both purified from WT TuMV systemically infected leaves) were also tested. For polysomal RNA, a single \"A\" insertion was seen in 2.9% of reads, while, for virion-derived RNA, a single \"A\" insertion was seen in 2.1-2.5% of reads. Due to the movement-deficient phenotype of mutants P and FSko, RNA from agroinfiltrated patches was used to test for slippage, with insertions detected in \u22640.01% of reads.

In these species, insertion of a single \"A\" at the GA 6 sequence occurred at a level of 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, and in both an elevated level of deletions was observed in comparison with the TuMV samples. We also analysed Plum pox virus data available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA) database Libraries were prepared and subjected to high-throughput sequencing in order to detect low-frequency insertion/deletion events. All samples apart from Ubi E2, eIF5B-1, eIF5B-2, BCMV and BCMNV correspond to TuMV. RNA was purified from upper leaves of systemically infected plants for samples TuMV WT, TuMV M1, TuMV M2, BCMV and BCMNV. Polysomes and virions were also purified from upper leaves of TuMV-infected plants. RNA from agroinfiltrated tissue was used for the TuMV P, FSko and \u0394GDD mutants. Additionally, T7 in vitro transcribed RNA (T7 transc.) and plasmid DNA (DNA) were analysed. Three GA 6 sequences in host genes-Ubi E2, eIF5B-1 and eIF5B-2-were also analysed. For each sample, frequencies of transcripts with an \"A\" insertion at the GA 6 sequence are shown in blue; frequencies of transcripts with two or more inserted \"A\" nucleotides are shown in orange; and frequencies of transcripts with one or more \"A\" nucleotides deleted are in yellow. (accession numbers ERX013141 and ERX013142; 12 libraries). The mean frequency of an \"A\" insertion at the GA 6 site was 0.8%, with frequencies for individual samples ranging from 0.3 to 1.0% (Appendix Fig S3) . Similarly, a low level (1-2%) of frameshift mutations at position 2,891 (which corresponds to the GA 6 site) has been reported for Zucchini yellow mosaic virus [20] . Together, these results indicate that around 0.8-2% of viral transcripts produced by the potyvirus polymerase allow expression of P3N-PIPO as a consequence of an \"A\" insertion at the GA 6 site. Although previous mass spectrometric analysis of cDNAs derived from RNA from TuMV-infected plants failed to detect transcripts with insertions or deletions [4] , this analysis may not have been sensitive enough to identify the low level of slippage observed. While we cannot rule out \u00c01 PRF occurring at some level in TuMV or other potyvirid species, our data suggest that transcriptional slippage alone can account for P3N-PIPO expression. An earlier hypothesis that potyviruses might use a novel +2 PRF mechanism, involving re-pairing of the P-and A-site tRNAs from GAA and AAA to A_AA and A_AN, respectively [10] , now seems unnecessary and unlikely.",

The bona fide pipo slip site was excluded from the shuffling and motif counting. In 99 genus Potyvirus RefSeqs, we counted eight (that is, a mean of 0.081 per sequence) non-pipo GA 6 sequences in the polyprotein ORF (four of which are at the proposed slip site for P1N-PISPO expression in Sweet potato feathery mottle virus, Sweet potato virus 2, Sweet potato virus G and Sweet potato virus C [21] ). However, in the randomized sequences, we counted a mean of 2.52 non-pipo GA 6 sequences per sequence. Thus, excepting functionally utilized slip sites, GA 6 sequences are highly under-represented in potyvirus coding sequences. Under-representation was also observed for A 7 , A 6 , U 7 and U 6 sequences, but not appreciably for GA 5 , A 5 or U 5 (Appendix Fig S4) .",

            "text": "Transcriptional slippage for gene expression has been reported in several bacterial genes [22,23] and as a mechanism for transposase expression in bacterial insertion sequence elements [24] . In viruses of eukaryotes, transcriptional slippage has been documented in paramyxoviruses and ebolaviruses (see Introduction; [25-28]). Transcriptional slippage has also been reported for Hepatitis C virus (HCV). In HCV-1, slippage on an A 10 sequence allows expression of the F ORF, which overlaps the polyprotein ORF in the +1 reading frame [29, 30] . Although antibodies against F ORF peptides have been detected in chronically infected patients, it is not known whether the F ORF encodes a functional product and, furthermore, fewer than 1% of HCV isolates contain the A 10 sequence [29]. Thus, transcriptional slippage in HCV is likely accidental rather than \"programmed\". Transcriptional slippage, or stuttering, also occurs in some negative-strand RNA virus taxa (including the families Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) for polyadenylation of the mRNA transcripts [31] . Polymerase stuttering on poly(A) and poly(U) templates is also thought to maintain poly(A) tail length in picornaviruses [32] . As potyvirid genomes are also polyadenylated, and the polymerase is structurally related to the poliovirus polymerase, it is possible that the potyvirid polymerase is pre-adapted to slip at homopolymeric runs of A or U.",

            "text": "The ability of RNA polymerases to slip on homopolymeric sequences above a certain length is believed to be linked to the length and stability of the template:nascent RNA duplex within the polymerase [33] . Furthermore, some RNA polymerases appear to be inherently more slip-prone than others [33, 34] . The duplex length has been reported as 8-9 bp for bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and 7-8 bp for the single-subunit T7 polymerase [35] [36] [37] , while RdRps of positive-sense RNA viruses in the Picornavirus genus constrain a duplex of 7-8 bp [38] . In Thermus thermophilus dnaX, slippage occurs at an A 9 sequence (T 9 template) and is~50% efficient [22] . The T7 polymerase slips efficiently (>50%) at U 8 and A 8 , only modestly at U 7 , and perhaps very slightly at U 6 [34] . Consistent with this, we observed~2.8% T7 polymerase slippage at GA 6 and a comparable level (0.8-2.9%) for potyviral RdRps. The role of the conserved 5 0 \"G\" is, however, unclear. Mutation of \"G\" to \"C\" or \"A\" in Soybean mosaic virus did not prevent cell-to-cell movement [8] , suggesting that the \"G\" is not essential for transcriptional slippage. The lack of a conserved nucleotide flanking the 3 0 end of the slip site and the observation that a significant number of species have a run of seven instead of six \"A\"s following the \"G\" (Appendix Dataset S1) suggest a strand specificity in the slippage mechanism with the G:C pair likely to function during positivestrand synthesis. It is possible that the \"G\" plays a role in regulating the amount, direction or strand specificity of slippage. In positive-sense RNA virus transcription, unlike in negative-sense RNA virus transcription or DNA-dependent transcription, the template:nascent RNA duplex is likely to extend a considerable distance behind the RdRp footprint, possibly only being disassociated when the next RdRp passes along the template [39] [40] [41] . Thus, transcriptional slippage in potyvirids may require formation of an unpaired \"bulge\" nucleotide. The stable G:C base-pairing may be required to limit the extent of bulging to regulate the amount of slippage or to prevent polymerase stalling or drop-off.",

            "text": "Transcriptional slippage poses a problem for RNA viruses because, unlike cellular organisms, the RNA is also the replicative form. Propagation of edited transcripts might lead to a homopolymeric 28, 42] . In contrast, a specific mechanism exists in paramyxoviruses to prevent replication of edited genomes. In negative-sense RNA viruses, the genome and antigenome occur in close association with multiple copies of nucleocapsid protein. In paramyxoviruses, each nucleocapsid is associated with precisely six nucleotides of RNA, and only genomes with lengths that are a multiple of six nucleotides are efficiently replicated [43] . A quite different mechanism may operate in potyvirids to prevent the replication of edited transcripts, as follows. In the potyvirus Tobacco etch virus, translation through a region near the 3 0 end of the polyprotein ORF is required for the genome to be used efficiently as a replication template [44] . It has been hypothesized that this may be due to the ribosome restructuring important RNA elements within the sequence encoding the CP, or ribosome-associated delivery of cis-active replication proteins. Transcripts with one or two insertions or deletions will lead to a frameshift and early termination of translating ribosomes, and therefore, these RNAs will not be replicated. The observation of transcriptional slippage in potyviruses opens the possibility of transcriptional slippage for gene expression in other positive-sense RNA viruses, particularly those with polyadenylated genomes [whose polymerases may therefore have evolved stuttering mechanisms to maintain poly(A) tail length] and where replication is linked to translation through certain genomic regions that become inaccessible in edited transcripts. Relevant to this, many positive-sense RNA virus genomes are preferentially replicated in cis [45] [46] [47] [48] .",
