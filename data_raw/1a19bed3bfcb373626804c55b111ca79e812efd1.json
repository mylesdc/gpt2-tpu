Here, IBV S1 and the ectodomain of NDV F proteins were separately linked with the trans-membrane and carboxy-terminal domain of IBV S protein (S TMCT ), composing rS and rF; thus, a novel chimeric infectious bronchitis-Newcastle disease (IB-ND) virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccine containing the rS, rF, and IBV M protein was constructed. Under the transmission electron microscope (TEM), VLPs possessing similar morphology to natural IBV were observed. To evaluate the immunogenicity of chimeric IB-ND VLPs, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with three increasing doses (50, 75, and 100 \u00b5g protein of VLPs). Results of ELISAs detecting IBV and NDV specific antibodies and IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 T cell cytokines indicated that vaccination with chimeric IB-ND VLPs could efficiently induce humoral and cellular immune responses. In the challenge study, chimeric IB-ND VLPs (100 \u00b5g protein) provided 100% protection against IBV or NDV virulent challenge from death, and viral RNA levels in tissues and swabs were greatly reduced. Collectively, chimeric IB-ND VLPs are highly immunogenic and could provide complete protection from an IBV or NDV virulent challenge. Chimeric IB-ND VLPs are an appealing vaccine candidate and a promising vaccine platform bearing multivalent antigens.",

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the pathogen of IB, is a member of Gammacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family (http://www.ictv.global). The genome of IBV is about 27.6 kb in length, encoding fifteen non-structural proteins and four structural proteins: Spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N). The M glycoprotein, the most abundant protein in the viral envelope, performs core functions in the process of coronavirus assembly and budding [3, 4] . Furthermore, the M protein is generally considered to be an essential component in the formation of coronavirus-like particles (CoVLPs) [5, 6] . The S glycoprotein, which is",

S1 and S TMCT were amplified with IBV M41 cDNA, and F ecto was amplified with NDV La Sota cDNA. S1 and F ecto were individually linked with S TMCT by digestion-ligation, thus forming the rS and rF genes ( Figure 1A ). To make these three domains function naturally, a sequence encoding a short flexible peptide (GlyGlySerSer) was inserted at the fusion site. The sequences of primers used in this step are listed in Table 1 . Underlined sequences are cleavage sites of restriction enzyme. \"CGC\" in boxes are protection bases. Italic \"TCC\" and \"TCA\" are inserted codons. \"TCC\" is the reverse complement to the glycine codon \"GGA\" glycine (Gly) and \"TCA\" encodes serine (Ser), and these codons, together with \"GGATCC\" (BamH I site), encode flexible peptide \"GlyGlySerSer\".

Furthermore, on the 8th dpc, the mean NDV RNA level in swabs from the VLP 100 group was significantly lower than that from the InLa Sota group (p < 0.05), and on the 10th dpc, the difference between the mean NDV RNA levels in swabs from VLP 100 and InLa Sota was very significant (p < 0.01). In the second animal study, IBV and NDV RNA levels in tissues were measured on the 5th dpc. In general, the mean IBV RNA levels in tissues of chickens from immunized groups were very significantly reduced compared with the Mock group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the mean IBV RNA level in tracheas of chickens from VLP 100 was very significantly lower than that from InM41 (p < 0.01) ( Figure 6C ). In the NDV challenge study, all 4 chickens in the Mock group died before the 5th dpc.",

Vaccination with multivalent vaccines has potential advantages in reducing costs and labor. Conventional live and inactivated vaccines against IBV and NDV are widely used in the field. Nevertheless, both live and inactivated vaccines have some obvious shortcomings. Mutants in the genome of viruses in live vaccines-as well as recombination between vaccine viruses and wild viruses-could cause the emergence of novel strains and further result in diseases in vaccinated individuals [18] . In addition, NDV live vaccines sometimes cause mild clinical symptoms [23] . Inactivated vaccines are thought to be safer than live vaccines; however, the potential for incomplete inactivation of the virus could also cause diseases in vaccinated individuals [18] . Besides, inactivated vaccines are not effective in stimulating cellular responses. To better control IBV and NDV, several novel vaccines against these viruses have been developed, among which reverse genetic vaccines are high-profile [32, 34] . Particularly, NDV reverse genetic vaccines (live or inactivated) have been licensed for use in the field. However, safety is still the major concern of reverse genetic vaccines. As mentioned above, when these reverse genetic strains are used as live vaccines, mutants-as well as recombination-are likely to result in the emergence of novel strains. In contrast, lacking viral RNA makes the VLPs non-infectious and eliminates the possibilities of mutants and recombination with wild strains, which could happen when live vaccines are used. Moreover, compared with inactivated vaccines, VLPs are more similar to infectious viruses in terms of structure and morpholog, so VLPs could induce stronger immune responses than inactivated vaccines do [25] . VLPs are considered the most suitable multivalent vaccine platform for RNA viruses with high mutation rates [24, 25] . The M protein has been proved to be essential in the construction of CoVLPs [5, 29] . In order to make the NDV F protein interact with the IBV M protein and further take part in the construction of VLPs, the TMCT domain of the F protein was replaced by that of the IBV S protein, thus forming the rF protein. Afterwards, the co-expression of the IBV M and rS proteins and the NDV rF protein in insect cells resulted in the generation of spherical particles possessing similar size and shape to native IBV. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified spherical particles showed that they were composed of M, rS, and rF proteins, indicating that chimeric IB-ND VLPs bearing IBV and NDV antigens were successfully produced (Figure 2A) .",

            "text": "To investigate whether chimeric IB-ND VLPs were efficient in inducing immune responses, purified VLPs were injected into chickens. Antibodies and cytokines in serum were measured. As for inducing humoral immune response, the chimeric IB-ND VLPs could effectively induce both IBV-and NDV-specific antibodies, and, even without adjuvant, VLP 100 induced comparable antibody levels as inactivated vaccines did (with adjuvant). In nonreplicating vaccines, adjuvants serve as critical components to elicit adequate immune response [35] ; VLPs, possessing similar morphology as the native viruses did, can be efficiently taken up by antigen presenting cells and processed in the same way as the native viruses are without any adjuvants [27] . As for cellular immune responses, the induction of significantly higher levels of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 than the Mock group demonstrates the ability of chimeric IB-ND VLPs to evoke both Th1-and Th2-type cellular immune responses (Figure 4 ). In contrast, the inactivated vaccines only induced significant IL-4 level compared with the Mock group; that is, only the Th2-type cellular immune response was induced [29] . Due to their structural and morphological similarity to infectious viruses and their ability to bind and penetrate host cells, VLPs could induce stronger cellular immune responses than inactivated vaccines did [25] . A quality vaccine should be able to prevent pathogen transmission. Our data showed that IBV shedding was efficiently suppressed in all vaccinated groups compared with the Mock group at all five time points, and NDV shedding was also efficiently suppressed on the 2nd and 4th dpc ( Figure 6 ). In addition, significantly lower mean IBV RNA levels in swabs from VLP 100 compared with that from the InM41 group were observed on the 6th, 8th, and 10th dpc (p < 0.01) ( Figure 6A ); the mean NDV RNA level differences between VLP 100 and InLa Sota were individually significant (p < 0.05) and very significant (p < 0.01) on the 8th and 10th dpc. In tissues of challenged chickens, the mean IBV RNA level in tracheas and mean NDV titers in lungs, tracheas, and small intestines of chickens immunized with 100 \u00b5g of VLPs were lower than that of chickens immunized with inactivated vaccines (significant or very significant differences were observed). These results indicated that VLPs performed better than inactivated vaccines did. It is generally considered that the stronger humoral and cellular immunity resulted in less virus replication [36] . The antibody levels in serum of chickens from VLP 100 were comparable to that from inactivated vaccine groups, so the lower virus titers in VLP 100 groups are due to the stronger cellular immune responses induced by VLPs. In line with the results of the detection of cytokines in serum, VLPs were able to evoke both Th1-and Th2-type responses, while the inactivated vaccines only evoke Th2-type responses. Th1/Th2 mixed response is generally considered to be more preferable than a T2-type for preventing and treating viral infection [37, 38] . In addition, the multivalent display and highly ordered structure present on surface of VLPs were thought to be a kind of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [39] , resulting in increased immunogenicity [25] . Due to the high levels of humoral and cellular responses induced by VLPs, after 15-day observation, no chickens immunized with 100 \u00b5g of VLPs died, and no symptoms were observed under the IBV or NDV virulent challenge, thus indicating that chimeric IB-ND VLPs are able to provide complete protection for chickens. Taken together, these data indicate that chimeric IB-ND VLPs are able to simultaneously induce IBV-and NDV-antibodies in levels which are comparable to that induced by single IBV or NDV inactivated vaccine (with adjuvant), and chimeric IB-ND VLPs performed better in inducing cellular responses and suppressing virus replication than inactivated vaccines did.",
