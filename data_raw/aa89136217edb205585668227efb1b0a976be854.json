Endophytic bacteria that are especially associated with medicinal plants presents a reservoir of therapeutic compounds. Fagonia indica has been recently investigated by numerous researchers because of its striking therapeutic potential especially in cancer. It is also reported that endophytes play a vital role in the biosynthesis of various metabolites; therefore we believe that endophytes associated with F. indica are of crucial importance in this regard. The present study aims successful isolation, molecular identification of endophytic bacteria and their screening for bioactive metabolites quantification and in vitro pharmacological activities.",

Endophytes are chemical synthesizer inside plants. They play a role as a selection system for microbes to produce pharmacologically active substances with low toxicity toward mammalians [4] .

Most of the isolated endophytic bacterial crude extracts showed antileishmanial activities against leishmania tropica with IC 50 values ranging from 1.4 to 6.6 \u03bcg/mL. Protein phosphorylation at threonine/serine and tyrosine residues by protein kinases is one of the major regulatory mechanisms in biological processes including cell proliferation, cell differentiation metabolism and apoptosis. Deregulated phosphorylation at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues by protein kinases produced as a result of genetic alterations acquired early in tumorigenesis are often the cause of cancer. In this respect, inhibition of protein kinases has emerged as a promising target for cancer treatment [37] .
