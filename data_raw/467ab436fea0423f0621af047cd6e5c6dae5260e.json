Experimental results show that diphyllin dose-dependently inhibits endosomal acidification in fcwf-4 cells, alters the cellular susceptibility to FIPV, and inhibits the downstream virus replication. In addition, diphyllin delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PEG-PLGA) further demonstrates an improved safety profile and enhanced inhibitory activity against FIPV. In an in vitro model of antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infection, diphyllin nanoparticles showed a prominent antiviral effect against the feline coronavirus. In addition, the diphyllin nanoparticles were well tolerated in mice following high-dose intravenous administration. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of diphyllin and its nanoformulation for the treatment of FIP.",

As a ubiquitous viral pathogen among domestic and wild feline populations, FCoV can be horizontally transmitted via the fecal-oral route with persistent infection, and the prevalence and seropositivity in multi-cat households or shelters may achieve 90% 1,2 . With regard to pathogenicity, FCoV exists as two biotypes, namely feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) 3 . Genetic mutations occurred in FECV within a persistently infected cat allow it to acquire macrophage tropism and change the virus into the virulent FIPV 4 . Infections caused by the former show no clinically apparent or mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis in kittens. In contrast, FIPV infections develop high fatality and progressive, multi-systemic disorders in young cat populations. Feline infectious peritonitis remains one of the most devastating and lethal viral diseases among Felidae, not only because of the high mortality rate, but also because of the lack of effective options in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment 5 . The disease is further complicated by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which can exacerbate disease symptoms 4 .",

Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) activity, which is responsible for pumping protons into endosomal compartments, has been identified as a requirement for feline coronavirus replication in previous studies 7 . The endosomal acidification process is also necessary for the establishment of ADE in FIPV infection 8 . Therefore, the endosomal V-ATPase presents an attractive target for antiviral intervention. In the past decades, abundant studies indicated that V-ATPase inhibitors could be applied to treat viral infections as well as other diseases including osteoporosis, lytic bone disease, renal acidosis, and cancer 9,10 . For example, the most commonly used V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, showed a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against several pathogens.

In a study on treating gastric adenocarcinoma, diphyllin decreased V-ATPase activity and lowered tumor cell infectivity for improved disease outcome 13 .

The block-copolymer is highly biocompatible and frequently employed for drug delivery applications, and the nanocarrier may benefit the diphyllin compound in two ways. Firstly, the hydrophobic cores of PEG-PLGA nanocarriers offer an ideal medium for carrying and delivering the hydrophobic diphyllin compound, obviating the need for organic solvents. Secondly, the intracellular uptake of nanoparticles via the characteristic endocytosis mechanism may enhance diphyllin efficacy by facilitating compound colocalization with endosomal V-ATPase, thereby reducing the drug's off-target effect and enhancing its antiviral activity. To examine the benefits of the diphyllin nanoformulation, cellular cytotoxicity and antiviral activity between free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles were compared. In addition, an in vitro model of FIPV infection was established to assess the viral inhibitory effect of diphyllin nanoparticles in the context of ADE. Finally, safety of the diphyllin nanoparticles were assessed following intravenous injections in mice. Blood chemistry analysis and body weight monitoring were performed to evaluate the drug's safety in vivo.",

The results from DLS demonstrate that diphylin-loaded nanoparticle exhibited an average particle diameter of 36.19 \u00b1 1.15 nm (Fig. 3C ). Quantification of diphyllin loading in the PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was performed using HPLC to determine the drug loading yield and efficiency. As presented in Fig. 3D (arrowed peak), the elution of diphyllin was observed at 8.8 min in the chromatogram. The standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of diphylin (1.56, 6.25, 25 and 100 \u03bcg/mL) that separately corresponded to each area value 116.19537, 489.75905, 1997.97016 and 5392.25782 (mAU*second) (Fig. 3D inset) . With the reference of standard curve, the content of diphyllin in nanoparticles for each batch was determined. In this study, the loading efficiency of diphyllin was 13.52% with a drug loading yield of 0.67 wt%.",

In clinical settings, recommended disease management during FIP manifestation includes a variety of supportive treatments, such as immunomodulatory drugs, antibiotics, anticoagulants, fluids and supplements 3 . Studies have shown that disease severity correlates with the systemic viral load 18 , hence, antiviral therapeutics that reduce the viral spread may be beneficial towards disease control. Previously, a coronaviral protease inhibitor GC376 demonstrated a promising advance in direct inhibition of virus replication in a clinical trial 19 .

Medium to low sensitivity to the inhibitor of endosomal acidification (NH 4 Cl) exhibited by serotype II FCoV 79-1146 cultured in A-72 cells was reported by Regan et al. 7 , whereas our serotype II FCoV NTU156 and NTU204 cultured in fcwf-4 cells has shown significant reduction when treated with bafilomycin A1, consistent with Takano et al. 8 , or diphyllin. Differential role for acidic endocytic compartments in cellular entry between these two FIPV strains suggests that the low-pH entry may be strain-dependent and biotype-independent. While diphyllin also exhibited inhibitory effect on NTU156 cultured in U937 cells under the ADE infection ( Supplementary Fig. S3) , we speculate the sensitivity to dipyllin exhibited by NTU156 is cell type-independent. In addition, type II FCoV 79-1146 cultured in fcwf-4 cells was found less sensitive to the treatments of viroporin inhibitors and cholesterol 24, 37 .",

            "text": "Towards applying diphyllin for therapeutic purposes, the compound's insolubility and potential adverse effect are two concerns that can be addressed using nanocarrier technology. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery presents unique advantages that arise from the carriers' nanoscale morphology and drug loading capacity. The approach has been applied extensively in anticancer applications, yielding formulations with improved delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy 15, [38] [39] [40] . More recently, nanomedicine platforms have begun to draw attention as an antiviral delivery platform. For example, acyclovir, a common antiviral drug against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), was delivered by nanocarriers for enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects, exhibiting a three-fold improvement in therapeutic effect in comparison to free drugs 41 . Saliphenylhalamide (Saliphe), a V-ATPase inhibitor, has also been shown to display enhanced viral inhibition when delivered via nanoparticles 42 . The virus-like dimension of nanoparticles may favor drug delivery to sites of viral infections as many similarities regarding cellular entry and in vivo biodistributions have been observed between viruses and nanocarriers 43 . In the present study, PEG-PLGA, a biocompatible block co-polymer widely used for drug delivery applications 44-47 , was applied for the encapsulation and delivery of diphyllin. The nanoparticles significantly improved the safety and efficacy of the diphyllin compound, increasing the therapeutic index by approximately 800-fold in one of our infection models. This pronounced enhancement can be attributed to multiple characteristics of the nanomaterial. Firstly, the hydrophobic nature of the PEG-PLGA nanoparticle cores facilitates diphyllin incorporation and obviates the need of organic solvents for compound dissolution. As a result, rather than permeating through the cells with the aid of DMSO, nanocarrier-encapsulated diphyllin relies on nanoparticle-mediated endocytosis for cellular entry. V-ATPase, the target of diphyllin, are ubiquitous among intracellular compartments and govern a multitude of physiological cellular functions 10 . Enhancing diphyllin localization inside endosomes may thus reduce the compound's potential side effects. Higher drug efficacy and improved cell protection by the nanoformulations can also be directly attributed to enhanced endosomal drug delivery by the nanoparticles. A higher effective dosage can efficiently reach the endosomal protein target upon nanoparticle delivery.",

The recognition of FIPV immune-complexes via the FcR by immune cells can enhance disease progression through altered cross-reactive cellular immune response, inefficient lysis of infected cells, and altered T cell-cytokine responses that collectively promote ADE. Although the relationship between serotypes or strains and the ADE phenomenon remains unclear 48 , the requirement of endosomal acidification for ADE has been well established 8 . Our study has demonstrated that diphyllin nanoparticles possess dose-dependent antiviral activity in an in vitro model of ADE of FIPV infection, which mimics the disease's clinical manifestation. By attenuating cellular organelle acidification, the nanoformulation effectively inhibits endosomal acidification responsible for virus uncoating and cytoplasmic entry (Fig. 7) . As the diphyllin nanoparticles are shown to be well tolerated in vivo upon high-dose intravenous administration, the formulation presents a promising treatment option against the lethal feline disease. Future studies with in vivo animal models of viral infections are warranted.",

After 20 min, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm and 650 nm using a microplate reader. Untreated cells containing 2% DMSO were prepared to represent 100% cell viability. When testing the diphyllin nanoparticles, empty PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were used as the vehicle control. The concentration of diphyllin that reduced cell viability by 50% (CC 50 ) was analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). 50 . To examine the antiviral effect of diphyllin, IC 50 of diphyllin (the concentration of diphyllin showing 50% inhibition of virus-induced CPE) against FIPV-NTU156 was assessed using the cell viability assay. Briefly, fcwf-4 cells were seeded on 96-well microplates (2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) one day prior to experiment to obtain an 80% confluent cell monolayer. Diphyllin was twofold diluted and added to fcwf-4 cells for 1 hr before virus inoculation. After 1 hr period of infection with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0001 with FIPV NTU156, each well was washed and overlaid with media containing diphyllin of the same concentrations as in the initial treatment step. An alternative FIPV-NTU204 strain was tested using the same infection protocol with an MOI of 0.01 and 0.1. After another 24 hr of incubation, cellular viability was examined by an MTT assay. Signals from cells without infection and diphyllin treatment were used to represent 100% cell viability. The concentration of free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles that inhibited virus-induced CPE by 50% (CC 50 ) was determined by fitting the data onto a non-linear regression curve using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).",

After a 1 h infection period, all test cells were washed and incubated with fresh media containing 2 \u03bcM of diphyllin and incubated for 24 h. (B) Cells were then harvested for CPE observation. Virus-induced CPE are indicated by arrows. Infected cells without diphyllin treatment (untreated) or 0.2 \u03bcM bafilomycin-treated cells were used as controls. (C) Extracellular viral titers in culture supernatant were determined with plaque assays. Viral titers between each treated group and the untreated control group were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test (**p < 0.01). Data in the plot present the mean \u00b1 SEM out of three replicates.

Infected cells without diphyllin treatment were used as controls. After a 1-hr period of infection, cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing the same concentrations of diphyllin as in previous step, and incubated for another 24 hr.
