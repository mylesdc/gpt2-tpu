            "text": "The severity of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with the hepatic innate immune response. The core circadian molecular clock modulates the innate immune response by controlling rhythmic pathogen recognition by the innate immune system and daily variations in cytokine gene expression. However, the molecular link between circadian genes and the innate immune system has remained unclear. Here, we showed that mice lacking the clock gene Per1 (Period1) are more susceptible to LPS/D-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-induced macrophage-dependent ALF compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Per1 deletion caused a remarkable increase in the number of Kupffer cells (KCs) in the liver, resulting in an elevation of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS treatment. Loss of Per1 had no effect on the proliferation or apoptosis of macrophages; however, it enhanced the recruitment of macrophages, which was associated with an increase in CC chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) expression levels in monocytes/macrophages. Deletion of Ccr2 rescued D-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. We demonstrated that the upregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 deletion could be reversed by the synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) antagonist GW9662. Further analysis indicated that PER1 binds to PPAR-\u03b3 on the Ccr2 promoter and enhanced the inhibitory effect of PPAR-\u03b3 on Ccr2 expression. These results reveal that Per1 reduces hepatic macrophage recruitment through interaction with PPAR-\u03b3 and prevents an excessive innate immune response in endotoxin-induced liver injury.",

            "text": "Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by severe hepatic injury with failure of hepatocyte function, resulting in a clinical syndrome of coagulopathy, encephalopathy and circulatory dysfunction. ALF is associated with high overall mortality, ranging from 30 to 80%. 1 Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of ALF. LPS enters the liver through the portal blood flow and promotes the hepatic innate immune response. As key components of the hepatic innate immune system, Kupffer cells (KCs) are postulated to have a central role in response to LPS. Upon stimulation by LPS, KCs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Many of these proinflammatory mediators can trigger hepatocyte cell death and lead to ALF. 2, 3 Recent studies in mice demonstrated that the actions of macrophages in ALF largely depend on the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages into the liver. 4, 5 Chemokines may be critically involved in this process of leukocyte recruitment and activation. Leukocytes sense concentration gradients and move toward increasing chemokine concentrations. One of the most potent chemokines identified for monocytes and macrophages is MCP-1, which acts by binding to the CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). Evidence from both murine and human studies suggests that CCR2/ MCP-1 chemotaxis is responsible for the mobilization and subsequent trafficking of a population of activated monocytes/ macrophages to the liver from the bone marrow. [6] [7] [8] Circadian rhythms are reflected by daily oscillations of multiple biological processes including the immune response. The fundamental mechanism of rhythm generation is highly conserved. Interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving clock genes, such as Per1-3, Cry1-2, Clock, Bmal1 and Rev-Erb\u03b1, create oscillations on the molecular level. 9, 10 In mice, significant temporal dependence of LPSinduced endotoxic shock has been reported. 11 The nuclear receptor Rev-Erb\u03b1 mediates selective circadian regulation of inflammatory cytokines. 12 Innate immune pathogen recognition mechanisms are also under circadian control. The circadian clock controls Toll-like receptor 9-mediated innate and adaptive immunity. 13 Blood leukocyte numbers have long been known to exhibit circadian oscillations. 14, 15 Recent studies have revealed that gene expression in macrophages exhibits robust circadian oscillation. 16 Given the intimate association between the innate immune response and circadian rhythms, we explored the role of the clock gene Per1 (Period1) in ALF induced by administration of D-galactosamine (GalN)/LPS, which is a well-established model similar to ALF in the clinical setting. The results presented here showed that Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice develop more severe D-GalN/LPS-induced inflammatory liver damage, as evidenced by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as more severe liver pathology. The hepatic recruitment of macrophages was enhanced in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, which leads to increased susceptibility to D-GalN/LPS. We further demonstrated that deletion of Per1 alleviates the inhibitory effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) on Ccr2 expression, resulting in an increase in the number of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice.",

To examine the effects of Per1 loss on the inflammatory response, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS in combination with D-GalN. In the Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice group, mortality became apparent at 5-6 h, and all mice died by 10 h. In the wild-type (WT) mice group, no death was observed at 6 h; the first animal death was observed at 8 h, and the survival rate was 60% at 24 h (Figure 1a ). Based on the survival rate, additional WT and Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice were killed 5 h after D-GalN/LPS administration to obtain blood samples and liver tissues for liver enzyme and tissue analyses. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities were found to be significantly higher in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice than that in WT mice (Figure 1b) . Histological examination of the liver tissues revealed more prominent liver damage in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( Figure 1c ). In the Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice group, massive hemorrhagic necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis were observed, with prominent vascular congestion and inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast, liver damage and histological changes were found to be significantly less severe in WT mice. Then, we explored the impact of Per1 on non-lethal liver inflammation induced by D-GalN/LPS treatment. The results showed that none of the WT mice treated with 3 \u03bcg/kg LPS and 200 mg/kg D-GalN died. Administration of D-GalN/LPS at this lower dosage caused no apparent liver injury in WT mice. In Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, the same dose of D-GalN/ LPS induced significant liver injury, as detected by increased transaminase activities and histological changes (Figures 1d  and e) .",

Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from WT and Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml). The expression of cytokines in macrophages was measured by real-time RT-PCR at 3 h after stimulation. Unexpectedly, Per1 deletion had no influence on the expression of any of the cytokines (Supplementary Figure S1 ). To confirm the phenotypes observed here, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Per1 by electroporation as described previously. 17 However, no changes in LPSinduced cytokine production were observed in either of the groups (Supplementary Figure S1 ). We next determined the number of KCs in the livers of Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 and WT mice. Administration of D-GalN/LPS significantly increased the number of KCs in both genotypes. Either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS challenge, a marked increase was observed in the number of KCs in the livers of Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice compared with the livers of WT mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against the KC marker genes F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3a and b) , as well as by the increased hepatic expression of F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3c and d) . We further used flow cytometry to identify specific populations of myeloid cells in the mouse liver. The data showed a significant increase in total F4/80 + cells in untreated and treated Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( Figure 3e ). F4/80 + CD11b + cells showed a strong capacity for the production of cytokines in response to LPS. 18 The relative number of these cells also increased in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS treatment ( Figure 3e ). These results implied that the increase in the number of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 livers may contribute to the immune response to LPS and to increased hepatic cytokine production.",

The increased number of KCs could also be due to enhanced monocyte/ macrophage recruitment to the liver. FACS analysis revealed a decrease in total CD115 + circulating monocytes in the peripheral blood of Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. The relative number of CD115 + CD11b + monocytes was also decreased in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( Figure 4a ). This observation implies that hepatic macrophage recruitment is enhanced in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. It was suggested previously that CCR2/MCP-1 chemotaxis is responsible for the mobilization and subsequent trafficking of monocytes/macrophages to the liver. [6] [7] [8] We have shown that Figure 4d ). Next, a cell chemotaxis assay was performed on the peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. We found that macrophage chemotaxis was significantly induced by MCP-1 stimulation. Macrophages lacking Per1 exhibited higher chemotactic activity than WT macrophages ( Figure 4e ). Per1 mediates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway. Previous studies reported that Ccr2 expression was repressed by signaling pathways involving PPAR-\u03b3 activation. [20] [21] [22] To investigate whether Per1 mediates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway, macrophages lacking or overexpressing Per1 were [20] [21] [22] We found that GW9662 reversed either the upregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 deletion in peritoneal macrophages or the downregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells (Figures 7a and b) , suggesting that Per1 regulates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that Per1 had no significant effect on PPAR-\u03b3 expression in macrophages (Figures 7c-e) , implying that Per1 may mediate Ccr2 expression by influencing the activation of PPAR-\u03b3.",

A ChIP mapping experiment indicated that both PER1 and PPAR-\u03b3 bind specifically to only the -180/+16-bp region of Ccr2 promoter (Figure 8a ), implying that PER1 protein may interact with PPAR-\u03b3. Vectors expressing HA-tagged PER1 and PPAR-\u03b32 were transfected into B6F10 cells. Immunoblots showed recovery of PPAR-\u03b32 from B6F10 cells after immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. As expected, we discovered a physical association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b32 (Figure 8b ). Addition of troglitazone (a synthetically specific PPAR-\u03b3 ligand) [23] [24] [25] or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins in immunoprecipitation assays (Figure 8c) . Finally, we used a series of HA-tagged deletion mutants of PPAR-\u03b32 and investigated their interaction with PER1. Our results showed that amino acids 1-280 of PPAR-\u03b32 interact strongly with PER1, and a further deletion of 97 amino acids (1-183) abolished the ability of PPAR-\u03b32 to bind to PER1 (Figure 8d) , demonstrating that residues 183-280 of PPAR-\u03b32 directly interact with PER1. However, residues 183-505, which also contain amino acids 183-280, could not bind to PER1. Despite not directly binding to PER1, residues 1-183 of PPAR-\u03b32 may be indispensable to proper structure of PPAR-\u03b32 and its association with PER1.",

We demonstrated that the elevated cytokine production in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice is due to an increased number of macrophages in the liver.

It has been reported that the nuclear receptor Rev-Erb\u03b1 mediates selective circadian regulation of inflammatory cytokines. 12 These reports inspired us to investigate whether Per1 directly regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to LPS. However, in vitro experiments revealed that Per1 has no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice macrophages, suggesting the higher hepatic levels of cytokines in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice may be due to the increased number of cells responding to LPS in the liver. Thus, loss of Per1 markedly increased the number of KCs in mice livers. F4/80 + CD11b + cells showed a strong capacity for the production of cytokines in response to LPS. 19 Flow cytometry analysis also revealed an increase in the number of F4/80 + CD11b + cells in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, either at baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS administration. This observation also well explained the elevation of hepatic cytokine expression in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice without D-GalN/LPS treatment.",

            "text": "Macrophages and their precursors, monocytes, have an important role during inflammatory injury. Monocytes migrate to the inflamed/necrotic area and subsequently differentiate into mature macrophages. [29] [30] [31] Even in steady-state conditions, KCs are constantly replenished by blood monocytes. 32 Peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population of circulating leukocytes. There are two functional subsets among murine blood monocytes: a short-lived CX3CR1 lo CCR2 + Gr1 + subset that is actively recruited to inflamed tissues and a CX3CR1 hi CCR2 \u2212 Gr1 \u2212 subset characterized by CX3CR1-dependent recruitment to non-inflamed tissues. 33 In this study, the decline in Cx3cr1 expression in Per1-deficient Previous studies demonstrated that Ccr2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice exhibit decreased macrophage infiltration following acetaminopheninduced liver injury, 34 indicating that MCP-1/CCR2 signaling is essential for monocyte migration to the injured liver. Increasing experimental evidence suggests that the chemokine receptor Ccr2 regulates monocyte entry into inflamed tissue, mainly indirectly, by promoting the egress of monocytes from the bone marrow into the circulation. [6] [7] [8] In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of Ccr2 is significantly inhibited by Per1. MCP-1/CCR2 chemotaxis activity was enhanced in Per1-deficient macrophages. Deletion of Ccr2 reduced the number of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. D-GalN/LPSinduced severe liver damage in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice was also ameliorated by Ccr2 deletion. These results further confirmed that the increased number of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice is due to the elevation of Ccr2 expression. The increase in the number of KCs in intact Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice implied that CCR2 may also participate in the replenishment of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice under steady-state conditions. Although it has been reported that Per1 has an important role in the cell cycle and apoptosis in cancer cells, 26 the increase in KCs may also be attributed to the influence of Per1 on proliferation and/or apoptosis in macrophages. Here, we showed that Per1 alters neither the cell cycle nor apoptosis in macrophages.",

            "text": "The ChIP assay clearly showed that PER1 protein and PPAR-\u03b3 bound specifically to only the -180/+16-bp region of the Ccr2 promoter. In contrast to transcriptional activation, trans-repression does not involve binding to typical receptorspecific response elements; however, PPAR-\u03b3 and transcription factors bind each other via protein-protein interactions, thus modulating their transcriptional activity. 37, 38 No potential typical PPAR-\u03b3 DNA-binding site was identified in the -180/ +16-bp region of the Ccr2 promoter, indicating that PPAR-\u03b3 represses the transcription of Ccr2 by interacting with transcription factors. According to previous studies, 35, 36 NFAT and C/EBP\u03b1 can promote the transcription of Ccr2, and their binding sites in the Ccr2 promoter overlap with this PPAR-\u03b3 binding region. Therefore, we speculated that PPAR-\u03b3 may interact with one of these transcription factors and thus indirectly bind to the Ccr2 promoter. Further studies are required to support this hypothesis. mPERs have been reported to directly bind to nuclear receptors; however, they do not directly bind to DNA. 39 PER2 has been reported to interact with the \u03b2-subunit of casein kinase 2, 40 glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, 41 REV-ERB and possibly other nuclear receptors. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] PER3 interacts with PPAR-\u03b3 via an N-terminal region including both PAS domains and a preceding predicted helix-loop-helix motif. 44 The recruitment of PER1 to the PPAR\u03b3 binding region in the Ccr2 promoter implied that PER1 may bind to PPAR-\u03b3 and stabilize the association between PPAR-\u03b3 and the transcription factor on the Ccr2 promoter. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a physical association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b3. The addition of troglitazone or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins, indicating that PER1 binds to PPAR-\u03b3 in a ligand-independent manner. Further investigation revealed that PPAR-\u03b3 utilizes part of its DNA-binding and hinge domains (183-280), but not its ligand-binding domain (310-505), to bind PER1. This result further confirmed that the association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b3 is ligand independent. Overall, the evidence indicates that PPAR-\u03b3 has an inhibitory effect on several pro-inflammatory cytokines via interaction with transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and STAT. 38 In this article, we showed that Per1 suppresses Ccr2 expression through the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway but has no effect on the expression of cytokines in macrophages, suggesting that Per1 does not participate in the association between PPAR-\u03b3 and transcription factors that functionally promote the transcription of these pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Similar MCP-1 mRNA levels between WT and Per1-deficient peritoneal macrophages suggest that the elevated hepatic MCP-1 expression in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice is due to the increased number of macrophages in the liver (Supplementary Figure S1D). Hepatic levels of Ccr2 were also significantly elevated in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice (Figure 4b).

To further confirm the association between upregulation of Ccr2 and elevated susceptibility to D-GalN/ LPS in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, we generated Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 Ccr2 \u2212 / \u2212 (DKO) mice according to Mendel's law. WT, Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 and DKO mice were injected with 5 \u03bcg/kg LPS and 500 mg/kg D-GalN. Deletion of Ccr2 significantly rescued D-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, as detected by reduced levels of serum ALT and AST in WT and DKO mice compared with Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice at 5 h after treatment(Figures 5a and b). Histological examinations of liver sections showed less severe confluent, hemorrhagic necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis in WT and DKO mice compared with those in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice(Figure 5c). We next determined the number of KCs in mice with different genotypes. Deletion of Ccr2 rescued the abnormal accumulation of KCs in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, as determined by immunohistochemistry for F4/80 and CD68(Figures 6a and b). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in total hepatic F4/80 + cells in DKO mice, either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS treatment. A relative decrease in the number of F4/80 + CD11b + cells was also observed in DKO mice compared with Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. Although the proportions of both hepatic nonparenchymal subsets in DKO mice are similar to those in WT mice(Figure 6c). These results indicated that deletion of Ccr2 rescues D-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice by reducing hepatic macrophage recruitment.",
