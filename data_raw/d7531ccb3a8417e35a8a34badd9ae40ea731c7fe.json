            "text": "Wildlife has been considered the main source of novel viruses causing emerging infectious diseases. Marmota himalayana is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Here, based on a high-throughput method using Illumina RNA sequencing, we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and discovered multiple novel viruses, especially picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae. A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences. Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4: GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII. We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG. The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bisegmented PBVs but also in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs. Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs. We also proposed a putative model of how bisegmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution.",

Unlike the conventional twosegment genomes of PBVs (Fig. 3a) , we found four unsegmented genomes (named Marmot PBV HT1-4) (Fig. 3b , GenBank accession no. KY855428-KY855431). A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bridging segment 1 and 2 was performed with two pairs of primers (Supplementary Table S2 ). The expected PCR product was sequenced, and the truth of the junction between both segments was confirmed. The four unsegmented genomes were also confirmed by re-sequencing. The junction sequences linking both segments of Marmot PBV HT1-4 were of 20, 14, 12, and 19-bp, respectively (Fig. 3b) . Overall, 20 of 50 (40%), 17 of 24 (71%) and 104 of 117 (88%) intestinal samples from Zhongda, Deda, Dezhuotan, respectively, were positive for unsegmented PBVs (Fig. 1) .",

This recombination was reflected not only in the different phylogenetic trees between the two genes but also in the marked diversity of capsid protein sequences.

This is supported by the finding that 57 of 80 segment 2 sequences (covering all six genotypes of RdRp) had the GAAAGG motif in their 5\u2032 UTRs (Fig. 5) . This motif was also detected in 221 of 289 segment 1 sequences (covering all eight clusters classified) (Fig. 5) . Direct repeat sequences have been identified in DNA viruses, RNA viruses or phages 10, 32-37 . Direct repeat sequences evolved through multiple duplications, deletions, and mutations of a primordial sequence element in tick-borne flaviviruses 33 . Interestingly, of 289 segment 1 sequences with the GAAAGG motif, 143, 73, and 5 had one, two, and three copies, respectively, in their 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5) . Among the 80 segment 2 sequences with the GAAAGG motif, 55 and 4 had one and two copies, respectively, in their 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5 ). The specific mechanism by which GAAAGG-mediated genome segmentation occurs needs to be further studied.",
