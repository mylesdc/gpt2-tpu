The CH strain (10 8.4 copies/mg) had higher viral titers than the CH60 strain (10 4.9 copies/mg) in the liver and caused ecchymotic hemorrhaging on the liver surface. Additionally, livers from ducklings inoculated with the CH strain were significantly infiltrated by numerous red blood cells, accompanied by severe cytokine storms, but similar signs were not observed in the livers of ducklings inoculated with the CH60 strain. In conclusion, the severe cytokine storm caused by the CH strain apparently induces hemorrhagic lesions in the liver, which might be a key factor in the rapid death of ducklings.",

The liver, a major site for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, plays a critical role in defending against invasive pathogens 3,4 . Immune responses in the liver appear to have evolved to balance virus eradication and immunopathology 5 . Major hepatotropic viruses, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), interact with innate immunity factors and induce both interferons (IFNs, types I and III) and antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and these viruses have developed multiple strategies to escape innate immune responses 6-10 . Inflammation is a double-edged sword that plays a vital role in liver metabolism. Moderate inflammatory responses confer a certain degree of protection, help repair damaged tissue, and promote steady-state reconstruction. However, uncontrolled inflammatory responses are present in most clinical cases of liver disease and may form a \"storm\" that causes liver damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and other adverse consequences 11-13 .",

However, small numbers of lymphocytes were found in the hepatic sinusoid at 24 hpi (Fig. 3B ). At 36 hpi, hepatocytes were significantly infiltrated by large numbers of red blood cells, accompanied by steatosis, necrosis and hepatic lobule disappearance (Fig. 3C) . Additionally, numerous lymphocytes infiltrated the hepatic sinusoid, and cell nuclei underwent pyknosis or karyolysis at 48 hpi (Fig. 3D) . Moreover, we observed numerous apoptotic bodies ( Fig. 3 black arrows) and a small number of lymphocytes ( Fig. 3 white arrows). We also observed the proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells, accompanied by notable steatosis and concentrated cell nuclei (Fig. 3E) . No obvious pathological damage was observed in CH60-inoculated ducklings; however, we found scattered lymphocytes distributed in the hepatic sinusoid ( Fig. 3H-M) .",

PRRs, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), recognize viral RNA. Therefore, we measured the expression levels of these four PRRs in the liver. As shown in Fig. 6 , the CH strain downregulated TLR3 and TLR7 during the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi); this downregulation was most obvious at 36 hpi. During the later stage of infection (60 hpi, 72 hpi), TLR3 and TLR7 expression gradually increased. Similar observations were made regarding the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I. Downregulation of these four PRRs may be related to viral escape mechanisms. The CH strain blocked the expression of host antiviral molecules by inhibiting the expression of PRRs to facilitate its own proliferation, as shown by characterizing viral replication (Fig. 5) . Additionally, the CH60 strain up-regulated TLR7 within 36-72 hpi. Subsequently, we detected the expression of IPS-1, a key molecule downstream of MDA5 and RIG-I. IPS-1 was significantly up-regulated at 36-48 hpi with both CH and CH60 and exhibited some hysteresis compared with MDA5 and RIG-I expression, a trend that supported its involvement in host regulatory mechanisms.",

Similar results were found in blood samples from CH-inoculated ducklings (Fig. 6 ). Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 expression in the livers of CH-inoculated ducklings was 133-fold higher at 48 hpi. Next, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) were assessed in the liver and blood samples. The expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 in the liver were significantly up-regulated after CH infection, peaked at 36 hpi and maintained the same levels until 48 hpi. However, IL-10 expression in the blood was downregulated before 48 hpi. The cytokine storm caused by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the livers of CH-inoculated ducklings was related to gross lesions ( In CH60-inoculated ducklings, the expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 also changed. Remarkably, IFN-\u03b3 expression was up-regulated, but IL-10 expression showed no obvious changes, potentially indicating the engagement of adaptive immunity. Changes in IL-4 expression were similar to those observed for TNF-\u03b1. Specifically, both the CH and CH60 strains inhibited IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 expression during the early stage of infection, and both cytokines were up-regulated after 60 hpi.",

In this study, we established an experimental model of infection with the virulent CH DHAV-1 strain and the attenuated CH60 commercial vaccine strain to investigate the pathogenicity of DHAV-1 and immune responses in 7-day-old ducklings. The CH strain caused nearly 50% mortality in ducklings and induced more efficient virus replication in the liver. Massive hemorrhages and necrotic lesions appeared on the liver surface with virus replication of the CH strain, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature 2, 19, 20 . Additionally, the presence of microscopic lesions revealed liver parenchyma infiltration by large numbers of red blood cells, and this effect was accompanied by hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis corresponding to hemorrhages and necrotic lesions on the liver surface. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, which are recognized by PRRs. Picornaviruses are recognized by three classical PRRs: TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) 18 . TLRs are transmembrane proteins that recognize viral components in extracellular and cytoplasmic vacuoles; TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA, while TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA 21, 22 . RLRs constitute a family of cytoplasmic proteins that includes RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. RIG-I binds to dsRNA or ssRNA bearing a 5\u2032 triphosphate, and MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA 23, 24 . We evaluated the expression of TLR3, TLR7, MDA5, RIG-I and NLRP3 at 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi. The CH strain significantly inhibited these five PRRs. Therefore, we hypothesized that this phenomenon might be associated with immunological escape mechanisms of the DHAV-1 CH strain. The escape mechanisms of enterovirus 25 , which also belongs to the picornavirus family, have previously been elucidated. For example, the 2 A proteins of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus B3 cleave MDA5, and the 3 C protein inhibits the expression of RIG-I [26] [27] [28] . According to Barral PM et al., poliovirus (PV) depends on caspases and proteasomes to reduce the expression of MDA5 after infecting cells, and PV may block type I IFN production by cleaving MDA5 29 . As shown by Kotla S et al. 30 , PV Figure 6 . Dynamic changes in immune-related genes in the livers and blood of CH and CH60-inoculated ducklings. The livers and blood of CH and CH60-inoculated ducklings were collected at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hpi. Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared for cytokine detection. Cytokine expression levels were measured by the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method with relative quantification. Differences in expression levels of the various genes between strains CH and CH60 at each time point (24, 36, 48 , 60 and 72 hpi) were analyzed using Student's t test and were considered significant as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001.",

However, the escape mechanisms of DHAV-1 have not been elucidated, and subsequent experiments using siRNA knockdown or poly I:C stimulation are required to further confirm the roles of PRRs in DHAV infection and specific escape mechanisms 31 . Expression of the PRRs TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and NLRP-3 was depressed in the first 48 hours, while that of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 was elevated in the first 48 hpi. Interestingly, IPS-1 (also called MAVS) expression was elevated in the first 48 hours. In the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the RNA virus is first recognized by NOD2, and MAVS is then activated, resulting in the elevated expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. In addition, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which activates IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, can be activated via MAVS-dependent and independent mechanisms 32 . Therefore, DHAV-1 may elevate cytokine levels via the NOD-Like receptor signaling pathway.",

Hepatocyte apoptosis is an important feature of acute liver injuries and either precedes or exists simultaneously to the onset of necrosis 35 . Therefore, we characterized the apoptosis of CH and CH60-inoculated livers (Fig. 4B-D) . The CH strain induced massive hepatocyte apoptosis as well as oncotic necrosis (Fig. 3B-F) , which are typical of acute liver injury. TNF-\u03b1, a death receptor ligand, initiates apoptosis. However, TNF-\u03b1 expression was inhibited by both the CH and CH60 strains. Other stimuli that initiate apoptosis include Fas ligand, DNA damage and growth factor withdrawal 36, 37] . X. D. Sheng et al. 38 evaluated apoptosis-related gene expression in the livers of DHAV-1-infected ducklings and observed the significant up-regulation of Bcl-2 transcription, whereas the expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9 was not obviously altered. Therefore, the specific mechanisms underlying DHAV-1-induced apoptosis require further investigation.",

            "text": "A cytokine storm is an excessive immune response stimulated by viruses, bacteria and external factors. A severe cytokine storm produces markedly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNs, interleukins, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factors, which are responsible for multi-organ dysfunction, via a specific feedback mechanism [39] [40] [41] . Cytokine storms were first discovered in graft-versus-host disease in 1993 42 , and influenza virus, variola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were all later found to cause severe cytokine storms [43] [44] [45] . However, there have been no reports investigating cytokine storms resulting from DHAV-1 infection. In our study, the IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 transcriptional levels were markedly up-regulated. Furthermore, the liver surface exhibited extensive punctate hemorrhaging, and the liver parenchyma was significantly infiltrated with numerous red blood cells, accompanied by steatosis and necrosis. Similar effects were not observed in CH60-inoculated ducklings, but cytokine storms have been identified in the adult duck kidney 14 and liver 46 . Therefore, the pathological mechanisms induced by DHAV-1 are likely related to severe cytokine storms. IFN-\u03b3 is primarily secreted by Th1 cells and mononuclear macrophages, which are associated with cellular immunity. However, IL-10 is largely secreted by Th2 cells, which inhibit the proliferation and activation of Th1 cells, and monocyte macrophages, thus promoting the proliferation and activation of B lymphocytes and correlating with humoral immunity 47 . Notably, IL-10 was up-regulated after CH strain infection, but IFN-\u03b3 expression did not change significantly. The hyper-induction of IL-10 potentially inhibits IFN-\u03b3 expression and, in turn, inhibits cellular immunity rather than enhancing humoral immunity. Persistent inflammatory responses cause immune system dysfunction and ultimately cause liver damage.",
