[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The serious illnesses associated with HRV are mostly reported among children, immunocompromised adults, and the elderly. HRVs are present worldwide, all yearround, and therefore account for a significant amount of viral respiratory tract infections. These result in restricted activities, work, and school absenteeism which, in turn, directly and indirectly lead to considerable economic burden. 11, 12 Despite the economic and medical importance of HRV, little is known about their circulation dynamics and serotype diversity in Kenya.

The rate of synonymous nucleotide per non-synonymous site (dN) against that of nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (dS), which is the dN/dS ratio, was used as an index to assess selection pressure and was interpreted as follows: dN/dS >1 = positive (diversifying) selection, whereas dN/dS <1 = negative selection (purifying) and dN/dS = 1 means neutral selection. The level of significance for selection was based on the P-value. Strong evidence of selection was indicated by a P-value < 0\u00c105.",

In this study, we sought to address this gap and found that in 2008, all the three species of HRVs were detected in patients who presented with ILI symptoms in hospitals across Kenya. Whereas symptoms data for all patients were available, no clinical diagnosis data were provided by the attending clinicians and therefore it was not possible to associate HRV infection with disease severity. However, detection of HRV in symptomatic patients enrolled in this study suggests that in Kenya, HRVs contribute to diseases that manifest as ILI. Indeed, some studies have reported more frequent HRV detection in symptomatic than asymptomatic cases. 19, 20 In 2008, HRV-A was the predominant strain circulating in Kenya followed by HRV-C and the least common was HRV-B. Studies in other countries reported similar predominance of HRV-A between 2009 and 2012 in the United States, Japan, UK, and the Netherlands, 21 -24 yet others have reported HRV-B as the predominant species in Spain and Thailand in the same period. 6, 25 Recently, a higher prevalence of HRV-C over HRV-A was observed in Australia among preschool-aged children. 26 Whereas the majority (96%) of the patients in this study were children, it is known that the distribution patterns of HRV may vary depending on population under study. 27, 28 Phylogenetic analysis confirmed circulation of 20 diverse HRV serotypes in Kenya in 2008. The most predominant serotype was C02 (three) followed by C13, A01, and A20 all of which had two strains detected, while all the other serotypes recorded one strain each. This is in contrast to findings in Mongolia where the most frequently detected HRV serotypes were A12, A46, A78, A80, B6, B35, B52, B86, C2, C5, and C4 between the years 2008 and 2013. 29 Furthermore, our findings here were limited to a period of 1 year and may not represent a good comparator.",

These findings echo those of previous reports. 31, 32 This study had three major limitations. First, due to the retrospective approach of the study, it was not possible to include a control group of asymptomatic patients from the same period. The control group would have facilitated association of a particular HRV type with severity of disease. Secondly, the sampling period was only limited to 1 year which could have lead to underestimation of the type diversity overall. A longer study observation period may have revealed a different picture. Finally, the lack of clinical diagnosis data for patients enrolled in this study hampered efforts to link HRV infection to disease severity. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is the first study cataloging a year-long countrywide circulation of HRV species and serotypes in Kenya.",
