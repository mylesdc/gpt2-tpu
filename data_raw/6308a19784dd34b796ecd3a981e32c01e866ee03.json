            "text": "Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that contains a big open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5 -and 3untranslated regions (UTRs). Nearly 30,000 JE cases with 10,000 deaths are still annually reported in East Asia. Although the JEV genotype III vaccine has been licensed, it elicits a lower protection against other genotypes. Moreover, no effective treatment for a JE case is developed. This study constructed a pBR322-based and cytomegaloviruses (CMV) promoter-driven JEV replicon for the production of JEV single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) in a packaging cell line expressing viral structural proteins. Genetic instability of JEV genome cDNA in the pBR322 plasmid was associated with the prokaryotic promoter at 5 end of the JEV genome that triggers the expression of the structural proteins in E. coli. JEV structural proteins were toxic E. coli, thus the encoding region for structural proteins was replaced by a reporter gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) that was in-frame fused with the first eight amino acids of the C protein at N-terminus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide at C-terminus in a pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon. JEV-EGFP SRIPs generated from JEV-EGFP replicon-transfected packaging cells displayed the infectivity with cytopathic effect induction, self-replication of viral genomes, and the expression of EGFP and viral proteins. Moreover, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of antiviral agents according to fluorescent intensity and positivity of SRIP-infected packaging cells post treatment. MJ-47, a quinazolinone derivative, significantly inhibited JEV-induced cytopathic effect, reducing the replication and expression of JEV-EGFP replicon in vitro. The IC50 value of 6.28 \u00b5M for MJ-47 against JEV was determined by the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP infection in packaging cells plus flow cytometry that was more sensitive, effective, and efficient compared to the traditional plaque assay. Therefore, the system of JEV-EGFP SRIPs plus flow cytometry was a rapid and reliable platform for screening antiviral agents and evaluating antiviral potency.",

Moreover, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase had a higher fidelity than RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Thus, this study constructed the CMV promoter-launched JEV replicon carrying a green fluorescence reporter (EGFP) (Figures 1 and 2) . However, the cloning process of JEV full-length infectious clones and replicons revealed that nonsense mutations (nt C741T and nt C831T) and the deletion with nt 574-1936 appeared in the onethird (nt1-3600) of the JEV genome at 5\u2032-end (data not shown). Importantly, the nonsense mutations and deletion identified resulted in the production of truncated M protein and the loss of E protein in the cells. Our findings indicated that the prokaryotic promoter activity of the 5\u2032 one-third of JEV genome directed the synthesis of the structural proteins C, prM/M and E that might be toxic genes or proteins in bacteria. The toxic sequences, especially the region encoding the prM protein, correlated with the genetic instability of JEV infectious clones and replicons in E. coli. Our findings were similar to previous reports that several E. coli promoter sequences were identified within the 5\u2032 end of JEV genome, particularly nt 54-120 [39, 40] .

            "text": "The CMV promoter-launched replicon did not need either an in vitro transcription step required for the T7 promoter-launched replicon, or co-transfection of plasmid containing T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter-launched replicon [21, 38] . Moreover, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase had a higher fidelity than RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Thus, this study constructed the CMV promoter-launched JEV replicon carrying a green fluorescence reporter (EGFP) (Figures 1 and 2) . However, the cloning process of JEV full-length infectious clones and replicons revealed that nonsense mutations (nt C741T and nt C831T) and the deletion with nt 574-1936 appeared in the one-third (nt 1-3600) of the JEV genome at 5 -end (data not shown). Importantly, the nonsense mutations and deletion identified resulted in the production of truncated M protein and the loss of E protein in the cells. Our findings indicated that the prokaryotic promoter activity of the 5 one-third of JEV genome directed the synthesis of the structural proteins C, prM/M and E that might be toxic genes or proteins in bacteria. The toxic sequences, especially the region encoding the prM protein, correlated with the genetic instability of JEV infectious clones and replicons in E. coli. Our findings were similar to previous reports that several E. coli promoter sequences were identified within the 5 end of JEV genome, particularly nt 54-120 [39, 40] . Since a restriction enzyme ApaI site was located with JEV genome nt 114-119, the nucleotides 1 to 119 of JEV genome encoding eight amino acids of the C protein were fused with the EGFP reporter gene in the CMV promoter-launched JEV replicon. In addition, the addition of restriction enzyme sequences NotI and ClaI before encoding partial C-terminal transmembrane (28 amino acids) of E protein allowed two unique restriction enzyme sites in the DNA-based JEV replicon that could be used as the expression vector in mammalian cells. Therefore, the CMV promoter-launched JEV-EGFP replicon did not contain the toxic sequence encoding the prM protein, allowing the stability of JEV cDNA clones in bacteria. In addition, recombinant plasmid with the nucleotide sequence 96-2477 of JEV genome encoding structural proteins C, prM/M and E was stable in bacteria due to lacking of the prokaryotic promoter at nt 54-120. The pFlag-CMV-CprME exhibited the plasmid stability in E. coli.",

            "text": "The pBR322 plasmid, a low copy number plasmid, was chosen as the JEV replicon vector. The plasmid pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon was genetically stable in E. coli, exhibiting high nucleotide (99.62%) and amino acid (99.19%) identities (Tables S3 and S4 ). The pBR322-based replicon also had a higher yield in E.coli than cosmid vectors and bacterial artificial chromosomes [21] , offering an effective and efficient approach for manipulating and cloning the viral genes. Among 23 non-silent mutations in the replicon compared to the original genome sequence of JEV T1P1 strain, eight mutated residues appeared within NS5 and three mutations occurred within NS3 (Table S4 ). These eight mutations in the replicon did not relate with active sites and conserved motifs of NS3 protease and helicase as well as NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase based on the structure and functionality analysis of flaviviral non-structural proteins [41, 42] . In addition, the other 12 amino acid substitutions in the replicon sporadically existed within NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B did not match with the reported mutation sites that altered JEV replication [43, 44] . The finding suggested that 23 mutations in the replicon might have no significant effect on virus replication. Functional characterization of JEV-EGFP replicon indicated a significant increase of green fluorescence intensity in replicon-transfected cells (Figure 4) . Moreover, the percentage and yellow fluorescent intensity of NS4B-positive cells were is much higher than the percentage and green fluorescent intensity of EGFP-expressing cells post transfection with JEV-EGFP replicon. The results might be associated with the loss or quenching effect of EGFP fluorescence by the fixation process of stained cells with paraformaldehyde, ethanol or methanol [45] . Moreover, the synthesis of positive-and negative-sense RNA subgenomes as well as the expression of JEV proteins were detected in replicon-transfected cells (Figures 4 and 5) . JEV-EGFP replicon contained CMV immediate-early promoter at the 5 -end, as well as HDVr and SV40 termination and polyadenylation sequences at the 3 -end, which allowed the production of functional JEV subgenomes (Figures 2-4) . The pFlag-CMV-CprME was utilized to establish the packaging cell line that continuously expressed C, prM/M, and E proteins to allow the production of JEV SRIPs 36 h post a transient transfection with JEV-EGFP replicon (Figures 3-5) . Therefore, producing JEV SRIPs was an alternative approach to overcoming the obstacles in the genetic instability of JEV infectious clones using the full-length cDNA sequence. Although there is still a question about whether these mutations affect the genome replication efficiency, JEV-EGFP replicon and SRIP generated in this study could be used to screen antiviral agents. Then, the antiviral activity of identified agents might be further confirmed using wild type JEV virions.",

The fluorescent intensity and positivity in SRIP-infected cells were further quantitated using flow cytometry ( Figure 5 ). The reasons for low EGFP-positive percentage and fluorescent intensity in un-treated SRIP-infected cells could be (1) a low infectious dose with 10 TCID 50 SRIPs; (2) the loss of EGFP fluorescence with the fixation with ethanol, and (3) a highly stringent threshold for the positivity of green fluorescence in the infected cells. For increasing the EGFP-positive cells without treatment, the elevation of MOI was used in the assay and the fluorescent intensity in the infected cells were directly measured using a fluorescence microplate reader under the condition without the fixation agents. In the screening assay to identify antiviral agents, Figure 7C based on the total fluorescent intensity showed the near line with a negative slope in antiviral activity of MJ-47 against JEV, but not Figure 7B based on the green fluorescence positivity. Since plaque reduction assay was labor-intensive, time-consuming and safe keeping, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP and flow cytometry might be easy, rapid, and safer approaches to determining the IC50 values of antiviral agents. Comparison of IC50 values of MJ-47 against JEV using plaque reduction and JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry indicated the IC50 value (6.28~16.05 \u00b5M) of MJ-47 by JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was lower than plaque reduction assay (34.5 \u00b5M) (Figure 7) . The result demonstrated that the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was more sensitive than plaque reduction assay, showing the potential application in antiviral drug screening and neutralizing assays. In addition, the system of JEV-EGFP SRIP in packaging cells plus flow cytometry was easily observed using a fluorescent microscope and quantitated by flow cytometry, suggested as a better tool compared to the luciferase reporter system [38, 40] . The approach for the design of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry might be applicable to other flaviviruses, such as dengue and Zika viruses. Moreover, the alternative approaches to quantitate replicon-driven reporter activity might be applicable for high-throughput screening antiviral agents, such as the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP and fluorescence microplate reader.",

Moreover, MJ-47 reduced the synthesis of viral genomes and the expression of viral proteins ( Figure 6C ,D), implying that MJ-47 significantly decreased the efficient self-replication of replicon-driven viral subgenomes. However, MJ-47 affected neither irreversible loss of JEV infectivity (virucidal activity), nor virus attachment to host cells (Supplemental Figure S6) . Therefore, we suggested that anti-JEV mechanism(s) of MJ-47 could be related with the influence on late stages of JEV replication cycle, e.g., viral transcription and translation. Interestingly, several quinazolinone derivatives had identified their antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses, such varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, and hepatitis C virus [46] [47] [48] . A 2-pyridinyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone derivative potently inhibited the replication of influenza A virus in vitro via suppressing virus neuraminidase and cellular NF-\u03baB signal [47] .
