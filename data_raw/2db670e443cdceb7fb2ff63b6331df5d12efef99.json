Commercially available assays to measure caspase-6 activity commonly use the VEID peptide as a substrate. However these methods are not well suited to specifically assess caspase-6 activity in the presence of other, confounding protease activities, as often encountered in cell and tissue samples. Here we report the development of a method that overcomes this limitation by using a protein substrate, lamin A, which is highly specific for caspase-6 cleavage at amino acid 230. Using a neo-epitope antibody against cleaved lamin A, we developed an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA assay that is suitable to specifically detect and quantify caspase-6 activity in highly apoptotic cell extracts. The method is more sensitive than VEID-based assays and can be adapted to a high-content imaging platform for high-throughput screening. This method should be useful to screen for and characterize caspase-6 inhibitor compounds and other interventions to decrease intracellular caspase-6 activity for applications in neurodegenerative disorders.",

Using positional scanning of peptide libraries, consensus recognition sequences have been proposed for each caspase and have led to the development of peptide substrates as well as inhibitors that typically consist of 4 amino acids (i.e. DEVD for caspase-3), followed by a fluorescent tag such as Afc (7-amino-4-trifluoro methylcoumarin) for a substrate or a 'warhead' such as fmk (fluoromethylketone) that covalently binds the enzyme for an inhibitor. These reagents are useful to investigate caspases that constitute the majority of caspase-like activity in a sample, as it may be assumed for active caspase-3 in highly apoptotic extracts [3] . However, with Km/kcat ratio differences of less than 10 fold for many widely used peptide substrates [4] , these reagents are not particularly useful for investigating the activity of a caspase present at lower concentrations in cell culture and tissue samples. In particular in developmental or signalling processes that do not involve cell death, intracellular caspase activity is likely under tight control by endogenous caspase inhibitors or the proteasome [5, 6] and the resulting low levels of activity are difficult to detect with peptide substrates.",

For caspases, it has been shown that the amino acid residue directly after the scissile bond (P19) is an important determinant of cleavage, since charged or bulky residues are not well tolerated [7] . Furthermore, domains far away from the cleavage site can mediate the interaction between substrate and protease (exosites), and although such interactions have not yet been shown for proteases of the caspase family, the high variability of cleavage site motifs in natural caspase substrates argues in favour of the presence of exosites. Known substrates for caspase-6 show a particularly high variability in their recognition sequences [8] , with cleavage sites other than I/D/E/L/T/V, E/ D/Q, X, D found in substrates such as the presenilins (ENDD, [9] ), huntingtin (IVLD, [10] ), DNA Topoisomerase I (PEDD, [11] ), AP-2 alpha (DRHD, [12] ), Periplakin (TVAD, [13] ), FAK (VSWD, [14] ) and TGEV (VVPD, [15] ).",

The presence of activated caspase-6 and cleavage of caspase-6 substrates is indeed a hallmark of AD, HD and cerebral ischemia, and has been shown in a number of different animal models and patient brain tissue [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . To assess caspase-6 activity in cell and tissue samples, peptide substrates or inhibitors need to be titrated accurately to yield meaningful results, since the peptide substrate commonly used to assess caspase-6 activity, VEID, can be cleaved by other caspases as well as the proteasome when used at too high concentrations [23, 24] . In addition, even low concentrations of a VEID substrate can lead to inaccurate results if the relative amount of other proteolytic activity in the sample is significantly higher than that of caspase-6 due to small differences in kcat/Km [4] . A recently developed method using the biotinylated caspase inhibitor zVAD is significantly more specific, but to achieve this specificity, immunoprecipitation and subsequent detection of the active caspase by Western blotting is required [23] . For a more quantitative way of assessing caspase-6-specific activity, we have developed a novel method based on the cleavage of lamin A [24] . Here we show that this method is sensitive, specific and allows for the detection of caspase-6 activity in complex samples. The assay quantitatively measures caspase-6 activity and can be useful for investigating caspase-6 biology as well as the screening and intracellular efficacy assessment of caspase-6 inhibitors.",

In particular it should not be cleaved by other proteases activated during apoptosis and be cut by caspase-6 in detectable quantities. The protein substrate should be easy to purify and thus available in larger amounts, and existing neo-epitope antibodies allowing for the specific detection of the cleavage fragment would be an advantage. The nuclear lamin proteins were among the first caspase-6 substrates characterized [25] , and knockdown studies strongly suggest that their cleavage during apoptosis is highly dependent on the presence of caspase-6 [24] . Furthermore, purified lamin A as well as a variety of neo-epitope antibodies against the cleavage fragments are readily available, and high stability of the cleavage fragments without further degradation during the apoptotic process has been described [26] , which should facilitate their detection.",

In particular, we were interested in the ability of other executioner caspases to cleave lamin A, since these are likely to show high activity in apoptotic extracts where accurate quantification of caspase-6 activity will be of interest. We first subjected the Ac-VEID-AFC substrate to digestion by caspases -3, -6 and -7, respectively. The amount of active enzyme used in each reaction was normalized to the concentration of active sites in the sample as determined by titration against the irreversible inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. S1 ). As expected, the VEID peptide substrate, although it is best processed by caspase-6, still shows significant cleavage by caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 1A ) at high substrate concentrations (100 mM). Lower substrate concentrations can be used to achieve greater specificity, however, the difference in kcat/Km for VEID is less than 3 fold between caspase -3 and -6 [4] . This results in a small concentration window that can be exploited to achieve selectivity for caspase-6, if the same amounts of active caspase-3 and -6 are present. However, this window will be lost if the sample contains a higher concentration of active caspase-3 than caspase-6. As shown in Figure 1B , an 8 fold molar excess of caspase-3 over caspase-6 is enough to lead to a significantly higher signal from the non-specific caspase-3, making VEID-based assays problematic for the use in apoptotic samples or other cell and tissue lysates with high levels of active caspase-3. Lamin A, on the other hand, only showed proteolytic processing when incubated with recombinant active caspase-6, not with the corresponding amounts of caspases -3 and -7 at concentrations up to 300 mM (Fig. 1C) . We therefore focussed on lamin A as a substrate for the development of a specific caspase-6 activity assay.",

To determine whether cleavage of lamin A is more sensitive than cleavage of the VEID peptide substrate in detecting low levels of active caspase-6, we incubated different concentrations of the enzyme in parallel either with Ac-VEID-AFC or purified lamin A protein and determined the amount of cleavage after 30 min by measuring the fluorescence in the sample (for Ac-VEID-AFC) or by subjecting the sample to an ELISA using the lamin A neo-epitope antibody (for lamin A cleavage). Comparison of the results showed that both assays perform at least equally well in detecting active caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM, with the lamin cleavage assay showing a linear concentration-response relationship down to the lowest caspase concentrations tested (Fig. 3A) . Signal-to-noise ratios were at or above 3 for the ELISA assay for as low as 10 nM caspase-6, whereas the signal-to-noise dropped below 3 for the VEID-based assay at this concentration (Fig. 3B ). Using a peptide inhibitor for caspase-6, VEID-CHO, both assays furthermore arrived at a similar IC 50 value (lamin-based ELISA: 64620 nM, VEID-based assay: 5666 nM), indicating that the ELISA method is suitable to assess the inhibition of caspase-6 by small molecules or peptides. Overall, our method shows a slight increase in sensitivity over commonly used VEID cleavage methods and is able to reliably detect caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM.",

Neurons in early stages of development up until postnatal day 5 express lamins of the B1 and B2 subtypes, which differ from the lamin A and C sequence at the caspase cleavage site (VEVD in B-type lamins and VEID in lamins A and C (Fig. 4A) [24, 31] ). Furthermore, the cleavage of lamins B1 and B2 at this site is not specific for caspase-6, as has been shown in a caspase-6-deficient cell line [24] . In agreement with these findings, we observed cleavage of lamin B1 in primary cortical neurons derived from both C6wt and C6ko mice at embryonic day 16.5 ( Fig. 4B) , while lamins A and C were not detected (data not shown). To overcome this obstacle, we decided to spike C6wt and C6ko neuronal lysates with purified lamin A protein, and after incubation at 37uC to allow for its cleavage by endogenous caspase-6 activity, we subjected the samples to our ELISA assay. We detect a significant increase in cleavage of lamin A protein when the incubation was performed in the presence of extracts derived from camptothecin-stressed C6wt neurons, whereas no increase in cleaved lamin A signal was observed in the presence of camptothecin-stressed C6ko neuronal extracts (Fig. 4C) . The ELISA method is therefore also suitable to detect caspase-6 activity in samples that do not contain endogenous lamin A or C protein.",

We therefore decided to test whether spiking of cell extracts with pure lamin A protein can detect active caspase-6 at early timepoints, before its translocation to the nucleus and cleavage of endogenous lamin A. To this end we transiently transfected COS7 cells with full-length human caspase-6, a system in which the enzyme auto-activates in the cytosol before translocating to the nucleus [32] . After transfection, the active form of caspase-6 becomes detectable by Western blotting at the 9 h timepoint (Fig. 5A) . After 24 h of incubation, low levels of endogenous lamin A cleavage were observed with the ELISA method, indicating that at this time point active caspase-6 is present in the nucleus (Fig. 5B) . However, when cell lysates were supplemented with purified lamin A protein and endogenous, active caspase-6 was allowed to cleave the spiked protein, activity could already be detected after 9 h and increased dramatically at later time points (Fig. 5B ), in agreement with the Western blot data (Fig. 5A ). This indicates that the spiking method can detect caspase-6 activity before endogenous lamin is cleaved and is thus suitable to detect non-nuclear caspase-6 activity.",

We therefore turned to a highcontent imaging platform that allows automated liquid handling as well as immunofluorescence imaging and quantification. Using a primary antibody specific for caspase-6 cleaved lamin A, we found increased perinuclear staining in C6wt cells after induction of cell death by camptothecin (Fig. 6A) . The observed blebbing of the nuclear membrane is consistent with the breakdown of the nuclear lamina during apoptosis. No staining for cleaved lamin protein was observed in non-stressed C6wt, non-stressed C6ko or camptothecin-stressed C6ko cells (Fig. 6A ). Using nuclear DAPI staining as a reference point, we quantified the perinuclear immunofluorescence in a ring around the nucleus (Fig. 6A, insets) , and found a 2fold increase in staining intensity in camptothecin-stressed versus non-stressed wt MEFs (Fig. 6B) . Only background signal was observed in C6ko MEFs even after camptothecin treatment, indicating that the detection of cleaved lamin A by immunofluorescence is also specific to caspase-6 (Fig. 6B) . This method is ideally suited for the high-throughput intracellular testing of modulators of caspase-6 activity in in the presence of confounding proteolytic activity, i.e. that of caspase-3.",

However, the presence of active caspase fragments does not necessarily correlate with proteolytic activity, since the proteases could be bound to either endogenous or exogenous inhibitors, which is especially problematic in high-throughput screening campaigns aiming to identify caspase inhibitors. Another method using immunoprecipitation with biotinylated zVAD, on the other hand, is specific to active caspases, but quantitation relies on the efficacy of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting [23] .",

Here, we confirm the specificity of lamin A cleavage by caspase-6 using C6wt and C6ko MEFs that were stressed with staurosporine to undergo apoptosis. Although the antibodies we used in this study cross-react with cleaved lamin C, specificity for caspase-6 cleavage is maintained, since both proteins arise from the same gene by alternative splicing, contain the same caspase-6 cleavage site and only differ in their C-termini with lamin A being 10 kDa longer (Fig. 2D) [28, 33] . The cleaved fragment was detected in C6wt, but not in C6ko MEFs, and we developed an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA method to accurately quantify cleaved lamin using the Mesoscale platform. The new method has an improved detection limit and signal-noise ratio over commercially available caspase-6 activity assays using the VEID peptide substrate. Furthermore, our assay is specific to caspase-6 and thus superior for the detection of caspase-6 activity in complex samples with a variety of different proteolytic activities such as cell lysates. Through spiking with purified lamin A protein, the assay can be applied to samples lacking endogenous lamin A and C such as embryonic primary neurons. Furthermore, the method is amenable to samples where caspase-6 activity does not lead to the cleavage of the endogenous nuclear lamins and is therefore not necessarily associated with apoptosis.",

A similar effect has been shown for proteases involved in blood Figure 6 . Caspase-6 activity can be quantified by immunofluorescent staining for cleaved lamin A. A: C6wt and C6ko MEFs were stressed with camptothecin, stained with an antibody against cleaved lamin A and analyzed on an automated imaging platform.

Direct inhibition of the enzyme as well as targeting of other players in the activation pathway might therefore be beneficial in these disorders. We show here that the cleavage of lamin A can be assessed in a highthroughput setting using a high-content imaging platform, making it an ideal intracellular readout to test interventions that decrease caspase-6 activity.",
