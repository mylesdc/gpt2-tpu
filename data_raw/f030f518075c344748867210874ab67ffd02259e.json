Mycobacterium-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells represent only a subset of the phosphoantigen {isopentenyl pyrophosphate [IPP] and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enylpyrophosphate [HMBPP]}-responsive \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells, expressing an oligoclonal set of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences which more efficiently recognize and inhibit intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Based on this premise, we have been searching for M. tuberculosis antigens specifically capable of inducing a unique subset of mycobacterium-protective \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. Our screening strategy includes the identification of M. tuberculosis fractions that expand \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with biological functions capable of inhibiting intracellular mycobacterial replication. Chemical treatments of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysates (MtbWL) ruled out protein, nucleic acid, and nonpolar lipids as the M. tuberculosis antigens inducing protective \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. Mild acid hydrolysis, which transforms complex carbohydrate to monomeric residues, abrogated the specific activity of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysates, suggesting that a polysaccharide was required for biological activity. Extraction of MtbWL with chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) resulted in a polar lipid fraction with highly enriched specific activity; this activity was further enriched by silica gel chromatography. A combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of bioactive fractions indicated that 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) are predominant components present in this active fraction. These results have important implications for the development of new immunotherapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of TB.",

Given the evidence that TB patients develop immune dysfunction, immune intervention regulating counterproductive inflammation and/or enhancing anti-TB immune responses may be beneficial for clinical treatment of TB and MDR TB (2, 3) . While immune therapy has been long considered attractive for adjunctive clinical treatment of TB (especially MDR TB); successful immunotherapeutic modalities have not been identified (4) (5) (6) . In fact, little is known about human TB immunity except that human CD4 \u03e9 T cells are generally believed to be important for TB resistance (2, (7) (8) (9) (10) Accumulating evidence suggests that \u2425\u2426 T cells play a critical role in TB protective immune responses and may be key both as early responders to acute infection and for bridging innate and adaptive immunity (2, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

These TUBag compounds have been shown to be active in the nanomolar range (i.e., with bioactivities up to 30,000fold higher than that of isopentenyl pyrophosphate [IPP]), thus suggesting that these molecules could account for most of the \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell-stimulating activity recovered from mycobacteria. Shortly after isolation of TUBag1 to -4, the first \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell antigen structurally identified was IPP, a metabolite all organisms use to synthesize isoprenoid compounds. The prenyl pyrophosphate family of phosphoantigens includes isomers, conjugates, or concatemers of IPP (27) . Exchange of the pyrophosphate moiety for a single phosphate moiety significantly reduces the ability of these isoprenoids to stimulate the expansion of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells (23, 28) . In contrast, alteration of the alkyl chain or conjugation to UTP had only minor influences on the potency of these phosphoantigens to expand \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells, suggesting that IPP is the naturally occurring prenyl pyrophosphate capable of stimulating \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell expansion. However, the concentration of IPP present in bacterial lysates is not sufficient to stimulate \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell expansions (29) . The most potent natural phosphoantigen described so far is a phosphorylated intermediate produced by Eubacteria and some eukaryotic organisms, called (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enylpyrophosphate (HMBPP, also known as HDMA-PP for hydroxy-dimethyl-allyl-pyrophosphate). This compound is 10,000 to 30,000-fold more potent for stimulation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells than IPP (30, 31) . In addition, synthetic bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP) is a strong activator of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells and has been tested for tumor immunotherapy and as a vaccine component (21, (32) (33) (34) .",

We first ruled out protein, nucleic acid, and apolar lipids with basic separations and enzymatic digestions. Mild acid hydrolysis, which digests complex carbohydrate structures, had the largest effect on specific activity. Fractions derived from a 10:10:3 chloroform-methanol-water extraction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv cells primarily consisted of glycolipids and carbohydrates. Antigenic fractions were tested for the ability to clonally expand human \u2425\u2426 T cells with inhibitory activity for intracellular mycobacteria. The highest biological specific activity (SA) was found in the most polar fractions eluted off silica columns with 100% methanol. Further fractionation using size exclusion column chromatography (G-50 column) was utilized and demonstrated the highest activity in an early-eluting fraction. These complex, antigenically active fractions were analyzed via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses revealed that methylglucose lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) are the predominant components present in all of the most highly active fractions. Further identification, purification, and synthesis of the novel mycobacterial lipid components which induce TB protective \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells may result in new immune intervention strategies for sensitive and drug-resistant TB.",

Dry-cell extract (2 g; \u03f31.5 g of carbohydrate content by \u2423-naphthol) was used to coat silica gel (60 to 200 m, 60 \u00c5; 2 g) and loaded (dry) in a silica gel column (60 to 200 m, 60 \u00c5; 40 g). The column was eluted with CHCl 3 (60 ml), 20% (vol/vol) MeOH in CHCl 3 (60 ml), 40% (vol/vol) MeOH in CHCl 3 (60 ml), 60% (vol/vol) MeOH in CHCl 3 (60 ml), 80% (vol/vol) MeOH in CHCl 3 (60 ml), and MeOH (60 ml). A quick \u2423-naphthol test revealed that the 40 to 100% MeOH-CHCl 3 fractions were carbohydrate rich. Carbohydrate contents were approximately 336 mg (40% MeOH), 420 mg (60% MeOH), 360 mg (80% MeOH), and 216 mg (100% MeOH). Aliquots (5 l) from each of the fractions (40 to 100%) were taken, and an alditol acetate assay was performed using GC-MS.",

Our subsequent identification strategy involved testing progressively more purified M. tuberculosis biochemical fractions for the ability to expand \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with inhibitory activity for intracellular mycobacteria. Chloroformmethanol-water (10:10:3) extractions of whole M. tuberculosis cells were found to retain the greatest biological activity. The resulting extract was subsequently loaded onto a silica gel column and products were eluted with an increasing methanol gradient. All eluted fractions were tested for the ability to expand inhibitory \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. The highest biological SA was found in the most polar fractions eluted with 100% methanol (Fig. 3A) . A 100% MeOH fraction was analyzed by TLC and stained with \u2423-naphthol to detect carbohydrate, ninhydrin to detect peptide, and Dittmer-Lester to detect phosphate (Fig. 3B) . The crude fraction of CHCl 3 -CH 3 OH-H 2 O (10:10:3) starting material (left lanes) and the further-resolved 100% methanol sample (right lanes) demonstrate the complexity of the initial extract and the partial purification success achieved with the downstream 100% MeOH fraction. The consensus analyses identified products rich in hexose residues, devoid of products containing amide bonds or peptides, and with few phosphate and no aromatic (phenyl) residues. Additionally, NMR spectra revealed a significant presence of O-methyl groups and anomeric protons corresponding to hexosyl residues (Fig.  4A) . MALDI-TOF analysis revealed a series of high-molecularmass products (\u03f32,100 to 3,900 amu), with profiles similar to that reported for the spectra of methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (46-48) (Fig. 4B and C) . The MALDI-TOF data directly support the data obtained from the NMR spectra and GC-MS analyses of alditol acetate derivatives of the enriched fractions (Fig. 4D) . GC-MS analyses corroborated the NMR findings and further identified 3-O-and 6-O-methylglucose in these highly active fractions.

PBMCs from two PPD \u03e9 volunteers were rested in medium (white bars), stimulated with 20 g/ml of mycobacterial lysate (striped bars), or stimulated with live BCG (MOI, 0.3) (black bars) for 7 days. After 2 h of restimulation with PMA, ionomycin, and GolgiStop, the cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, \u2425\u2426 TCR, Ki-67, intracellular IFN-\u2425, granzyme A, and TNF-\u2423 and analyzed by flow cytometry.

In addition, the results in Fig. 6B demonstrate that the mGLP fractions induce significant proliferative expansion only in \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells and not in \u2423\u2424 T cells. Furthermore, Fig. 6C shows that blocking BTN3A1, known to be involved in phosphoantigen activation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells, also inhibits mGLP-induced \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell activation. To determine if the mGLP-enriched fractions induced \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells in a TCR-dependent manner, or simply via innate immune activation receptors, we utilized an anti-V\u24259 blocking MAb known to inhibit \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell responses induced by IPP and HMBPP. These biochemical treatments consisted of (1) reduction and alkylation to disrupt disulfide bonds, (2) delipidation via organic extraction with chloroform-methanol (2:1) to remove nonpolar lipids, (3) RNase and DNase treatment to degrade nucleotide polymers, (4) base hydrolysis to cleave base-labile bonds, (5) acid hydrolysis to cleave acid-labile bonds, (6) pronase digestion to extensively degrade proteins, and (7) trypsin digestion to more selectively cleave proteins to complement pronase digestion. All the treated mycobacterial lysates were tested for the ability to expand \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells capable of inhibiting intracellular mycobacteria.

Mycobacterial antigens stimulating inhibitory \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells were highly sensitive to acid hydrolysis. results confirm that the mGLP fractions contain antigens capable of inducing TCR-dependent responses (Fig. 6D) . Based on these findings, we hypothesized that 6-O-methylglucose lipopolysaccharide, or a derivative or similar product thereof, is responsible for the biological activity inducing the mycobacterium-inhibitory capacity of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells.",

Previously identified small antigens known to stimulate \u2425\u2426 T cells include phosphorylated metabolites generated in the methyl erythritol pathway in mycobacteria. The most representative stimulatory molecules are isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP). Both are very small molecules, with molecular weights of 246 and 262, respectively, and are composed of one isoprene unit to which a diphoshate is attached. The phosphate groups of IPP are sensitive to terminal phosphatases such as alkaline phosphatase (23, 26) or apyrase. The novel myco-bacterial antigenic activity present in mGLP-enriched fractions could not be abrogated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 7A) . These results suggested that the \u2425\u2426 T cell-stimulating bioactivity present in the novel mGLP-enriched mycobacterial fractions is not due to phosphoantigens. 31 P NMR chemical shifts detected by analysis of the 100% MeOH fraction, as well as commercially available and highly pure HMBPP, are shown in Fig. 7B . The 100% methanol fraction did not show spectral peaks consistent with the HMBPP spectra, further supporting our conclusion that the biologically potent molecules in our novel, mGLP-enriched MtbWL capable of expanding protective \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell inducing antigen are not IPP or HMBPP. Finally, an SRM MS assay was developed for sensitive and targeted detection of HMBPP. This assay can detect levels of HMBPP in the picomolar concentration range known to activate \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. Our application of improved chromatography and use of our identical final preparation of mGLP in this assay greatly improved the sensitivity of detection a Expansion index is calculated as the fold expansion of the absolute number of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells after stimulation with treated lysates compared to the absolute number of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells after rest in medium.

With this improved sensitivity, we can confidently conclude that our mGLP preparations were contaminated with \u03fd2 pM concentrations of HMBPP, at least 25-fold less than required for efficient \u2425\u2426 T cell stimulatory activity. HMBPP was not detected in the 100% methanol fraction using this targeted assay, confirming that our fractions were not enriched for this phosphoantigen (Fig. 7C) .",

Therefore, these cells may serve as potent targets for TB immunotherapy. Clinical trials using various \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell activating agents, such as aminobisphosphonates and phosphoantigens, are ongoing for treatment of cancer (55) (56) (57) (58) . Such trials report low toxicity and improved objective clinical outcomes, including stabilization and partial or full remission of advanced-stage metastatic carcinomas of the prostate (59), lung (60) , and kidney (61) . Therapeutic activation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells may also prove to be beneficial in numerous other disease settings, due to their potent adjuvant and effector functions in innate and adaptive immunity (32, 58, (62) (63) (64) (65) . Data from a recent proof-of-con- cept study indicate that expansion of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells in vivo during pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection can limit M. tuberculosis replication and dissemination and attenuate TB lesions in nonhuman primates (3) .",

These results suggested that differences in activation induced by live BCG versus IPP were responsible for the differences in inhibitory effector function. Detailed follow-up studies failed to identify any differences in effector function between BCG-and IPP-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. In contrast, TCR spectratypic and sequence analyses of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell lines expanded by multiple rounds of stimulation with dendritic cells either infected with live BCG or pulsed with IPP demonstrated that the TCR CDR3 sequences of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells expanded by BCG and IPP were markedly different. BCG-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell subsets were significantly less polyclonal than IPP-expanded cells. In addition, the BCG-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells were universally responsive to IPP, but only a small fraction of the total IPP-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells were responsive to BCG. Similar results were seen with T cell lines generated from 5 PPD \u03e9 individuals and with hundreds of T cell clones expanded from a single individual. Furthermore, the more recently identified HMBPP phosphoantigen, a more potent phosphoantigen for \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells expressed in M. tuberculosis-and BCG-infected macrophages, also did not induce \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with pathogen-inhibitory activity. Overall, these results clearly demonstrated that BCGexpanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells represent a subset of IPP-responsive \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells and strongly suggest that BCG-expanded \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells express a restricted TCR diversity capable of recognizing unique M. tuberculosis antigens expressed by infected host cells distinct from the previously identified phosphoantigens. Based on this understanding, one of our goals has been to identify the unknown M. tuberculosis antigens capable of stimulating \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with optimal TB protective capacity.",

This extract was loaded onto a silica gel column and products eluted with 100% MeOH (Fig. 3) . (A) The 100% MeOH fractions were further loaded onto a G-50 column, and eluted fractions were tested for the ability to expand inhibitory \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. Note the \u03fe100-fold increase in SA with a carbohydrate-rich fraction (G-50 column fraction 01) compared with both total MtbWL and the subsequent fraction 02 or a mixture of fractions 03 and 04 eluted off the G-50 column. (B) mGLP and MtbWL induced similar levels of \u2425\u2426 T cell proliferation responses. PBMCs from two PPD \u03e9 volunteers were rested in medium (white bars), stimulated with 20 g/ml of MtbWL (striped bars), or stimulated with 1 g/ml of mGLP-enriched fraction (gray bars) for 7 days. After 2 h of restimulation with PMA, ionomycin, and GolgiStop, the cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, \u2425\u2426, Ki-67, intracellular IFN-\u2425, granzyme A, and TNF-\u2423 and analyzed by flow cytometry. (C) Blocking BTN3A1, known to be involved in phosphoantigen activation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells, also inhibits mGLP-induced \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell activation. T cells were cultured for 7 days with medium alone, 20 g/ml of MtbWL, or 1 g/ml of mGLP-enriched fraction, in the presence or in the absence of 103.2 anti-CD277 MAb (10 g/ml). After 2 h of restimulation with PMA, ionomycin, and GolgiStop, the cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, \u2425\u2426, Ki-67, intracellular IFN-\u2425, granzyme A, and TNF-\u2423 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Absolute numbers (AN) of Ki-67-, IFN-\u2425-, GzmA-, and TNF-\u2423-positive \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells were computed by multiplying the flow cytometric percentages times the numbers of viable cells present after expansion. (D) \u2425\u2426 T cells expanded with MtbWL, the mGLP-enriched fraction, or HMBPP were incubated with BCG-infected or uninfected DC for 3 h. A total of 0.7 l/ml of GolgiStop (BD PharMingen) was added, and cultures were incubated for five more hours at 37\u00b0C. IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and GzmA production was detected by intracellular cytokine staining. \u2425\u2426 T cells were pretreated with anti-TCR V\u24259 or control MAb for 30 min before coculturing with DC. Responses were detected as the percentages of IFN-\u2425-, GzmA-, and TNF-\u2423-positive \u2425\u2426 T cells after DC stimulation. Results from one representative experiment of three performed are shown. cells capable of mediating protective effector functions against intracellular mycobacteria, we have made significant progress toward this goal. As an initial step, we proved that MtbWL retain the capacity to stimulate \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with mycobacterium-inhibitory activity. We observed that mild acid hydrolysis of mycobacterial lysates removed the inhibitory \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell-stimulatory activity. Enriched polar lipid extracts obtained with chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) were further separated on a silica column, and products were eluted with an increasing gradient of methanol. Products eluted with 100% methanol were found to possess the highest specific activity when tested in \u2425\u2426 T cell expansion and M. tuberculosis growth inhibition assays. This novel fraction was then analyzed by TLC using \u2423-naphthol, ninhydrin, and Dittmer-Lester staining and was further analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, GC-MS, and NMR. The consensus analyses identified products rich in O-methylglucose and other hexoses, devoid of peptides, with either low or no phosphate or phenyl residues, including undetectable levels of HMBPP. HMBPP conjugation to our product is still possible despite the MS evidence to the con-trary, especially if such conjugates were minor products and their detection was suppressed due to poor ionization. MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed a series of high-molecular-mass products (\u03f32,100 to 3,900 amu), with profiles similar to that reported for the spectra of methylglucose lipopolysaccharide. From these analyses, we hypothesized that 6-O-methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (mGLP), or a derivative or similar product thereof, is responsible for expansion of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells with mycobacterium-inhibitory activity.",

One cluster, Rv3030-Rv3037c, encodes a glucosyltransferase (Rv3032) responsible for the elongation of mGLPs, as well as a putative acetyltransferase (Rv3034c), two putative methyltransferases (Rv3030 and Rv3037c), and Rv3031, which may be involved in branching (48) .

Analysis of the knockout (KO) and WT mGLP extracts for \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cell expansion demonstrated retention of activity, suggesting that lower-mass variants of mGLP retain biological activity (data not shown), further supporting the role of Rv3032 and Rv1212c possessing compensatory enzymatic activities and limiting our ability to use these knockouts in our studies until further structural requirements for the biologically active compound are identified.",

            "text": "Studies of the mechanistic requirements for antigen recognition by \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells have revealed important differences with those for \u2423\u2424 TCR cells. The major subset of human peripheral blood \u2425\u2426 cells express \u2425 9 \u2426 2 TCR heterodimers stimulated by phosphorylated metabolites (commonly called phosphoantigens). Our TCR blocking studies indicate that signaling through the V\u24259V\u24262 TCR is required for activation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells by our novel mGLPenriched M. tuberculosis stimulatory molecules. In addition, recent studies have identified butyrophilin (BTN3A1) as a key molecule involved in either presenting or sensing phosphoantigens, necessary for stimulation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. Butyrophilin-3A (BTN3A/CD277) is present in humans in three isoforms (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3) (68, 69) . Recent studies have shown that antibodies specific for BTN3A1 could either mimic phosphoantigen-mediated activation of the TCR (antibody 20.1) or abrogate this stimulatory effect (antibody 103.2) (70). Biophysical analysis of the underlying interactions suggested that the 20.1 antibody induced or stabilized a TCR-activating conformation of BTN3A1 (71) . Additionally, phosphoantigens and 20.1 antibodies activated the same intracellular signaling pathways in the responding \u2425\u2426 T cells, suggesting a common recognition process (72) . Sandstrom et al. demonstrated that BTN3A1 acts as an intracellular sensor of phosphoantigens binding phosphoantigen to a surface pocket located in the intracellular domain termed B30.2 domain. This result was confirmed by structural analysis of B30.2phosphoantigen crystallized complexes and by mutational analysis (73) . In the present work, we have provided evidence that our novel mGLP-enriched M. tuberculosis lipid components also require BTN3A1 recognition for activation of \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells. It will be crucial in future studies to elucidate the detailed mechanisms involved in mGLP-mediated activation of protective \u2425 9 \u2426 2 T cells and how precisely BTN3A1 is involved (in either presenting or sensing mGLP stimulatory molecules).",
