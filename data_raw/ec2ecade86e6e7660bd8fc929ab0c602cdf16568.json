            "text": "An epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) led to the identification of an associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. This virus evades the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non-structural protein (nsp) 1, which inhibits both host gene expression and virus-and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling. Thus, nsp1 is a promising target for drugs, as inhibition of nsp1 would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host antiviral defenses. To gain a better understanding of nsp1 mode of action, we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the SARS-CoV nsp1, targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein. From this work, we identified six classes of mutants that abolished, attenuated or increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression and/or antiviral signaling. Each class of mutants clustered on SARS-CoV nsp1 surface and suggested nsp1 interacts with distinct host factors to exert its inhibitory activities. Identification of the nsp1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting nsp1. Significantly, several point mutants increased the inhibitory activity of nsp1, suggesting that coronaviruses could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues.",

Naturally, viruses evolved to encode not only proteins necessary for their replication, such as their polymerase and capsid protein, but also security proteins that counteract the host defenses [2] . As unimpeded induction and action of interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection leads to a powerful antiviral state that strongly restricts replication of most viruses [3] , viral IFN antagonists constitute a major class of security proteins [4, 5] . IFN antagonists can be further distinguished based on their ability to i) inhibit the virus-dependent signaling necessary for the production of IFNs and other cytokines; ii) inhibit the IFN-dependent signaling necessary for the induction of antiviral genes; or iii) inhibit the activity of antiviral proteins.",

Its genome consists of a ,30 kb linear, non-segmented, capped, polycistronic, polyadenylated RNA molecule, the first two-third of which is directly translated into two large polyproteins. These two polypeptides are processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), forming the replicase complex, which is active in the cytoplasm in close association with cellular membranes. Transcription and replica-tion of the coronaviral genome leads to the expression of open reading frames located in the remaining third of the genome, which encode structural proteins such as S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and NP (nucleocapsid protein), as well as other open reading frames (ORFs) whose functions remain to be fully characterized [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

However, validation of their role as genuine IFN antagonists in the context of the live virus was obtained only for nsp1 so far [16, 25] . Two mechanisms were identified to account for the IFN antagonist activity of nsp1, general inhibition of host gene expression [13, 16, 25] and inhibition of antiviral signal transduction [16] . Specifically, nsp1 inhibits host gene expression by decreasing translation efficiency and by destabilizing mRNAs [13, 25, 26] . Additionally, nsp1 expression inhibits the three virusdependent signaling pathways that lead to activation of the transcription factors ATF2/c-Jun, IRF3/IRF7, and NF-kB, preventing full induction of virus-inducible genes, such as IFNB [16] ; moreover, nsp1 decreases the levels of STAT1 phosphorylation, inhibiting the induction of genes by IFN-a and IFN-c [16] .",

In addition to inhibiting host gene expression and virusand IFN-dependent signaling, SARS-CoV nsp1 also inhibits cell cycling and decreases cell death in transfected cells [16] . We hypothesized that these pleiotropic activities could be the result of multiple interactions between nsp1 and host proteins. If true, the prediction would be that individual residues in nsp1, which if mutated, would differentially affect the ability of nsp1 to inhibit host activities; if untrue no such mutations would be identified. Map of SARS-CoV nsp1 mutants generated. SARS-CoV nsp1 is a small 180-residue protein whose structure has been solved by NMR for residues 13-129. We hypothesized that surface residues would be important for interaction between nsp1 and host target protein(s) that would mediate the inhibitory effects of nsp1. Three rounds of mutagenesis targeting surface residues were carried out in this study (A-C). Mutant nsp1-m5 was identified to potentially mediate nsp1 inhibition of host IFN-and virus-dependent signaling (A) but not inhibition of host gene expression and was explored further. Mutant nsp1-m16 was generated to attempt to further resolve the nsp1-m5 loss of function, and mutants -m27 through -m30 (C) were generated to refine important residues identified in nsp1-m16 (B). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062416.g002",

Before the structure of SARS-CoV nsp1 was determined, we initially selected a few amino acids that were predicted to be solvent exposed (mutants m1-m8); after the NMR structure of SARS-CoV nsp1 was reported [32] , we selected additional solvent exposed residues for replacement (mutants m9-m39). The nature of the selected residues was changed, e.g., positively charged to negatively charged, so that if the amino acid was involved in an interaction with a host factor, that interaction would likely be disrupted. This abrogation of nsp1 to host-protein interactions would be reflected in the attenuation of standard assays measuring the level of nsp1 inhibition of host functions. The nsp1 mutants were generated by PCR, cloned into plasmids ( Figure 1A ), and were co-transfected into 293T cells along with plasmids expressing luciferase, bgalactosidase, eGFP, and a reporter plasmid expressing the CAT gene under the control of a virus-and IFN-inducible ISRE, ISREx3-CAT ( Figure 1B) . Standardized luciferase and b-galactosidase assays were used as a proxy for an nsp1 mutant's ability to inhibit host gene expression; inhibition of luciferase activity by nsp1-wt is mild (,40%) while inhibition of b-galactosidase is strong (,90%) [16] ; other investigators used different reporters as proxy for nsp1 effects on host gene expression [13, 25, 33, 34] . Expression of the ISREx3CAT reporter is stimulated by both IFN treatment and SeV infection and coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp1-wt results in an inhibition of that stimulation, which we previously showed was due to an inhibitory effect on signaling and not on expression of the CAT gene [16] . Thus, CAT expression is used here as a proxy for an nsp1 mutant's ability to inhibit virusand IFN-dependent signaling. Immunoblots were run and quantitated to measure the expression levels of all nsp1 mutants in these experiments ( Figure 1C ). Direct measurement of virusand IFN-dependent signaling was also carried out (see below).",

As expected, variants were discovered that exhibited attenuated (nsp1-m1) or almost complete loss of inhibition (nsp1-m4, -m7 and -m8) of both signaling ( Figure 3A ) and gene expression ( Figure 3B ,C). Expression of all nsp1 mutants was compared to that of nsp1-wt ( Figure 3D ); some variants, such as nsp1-m8, were consistently expressed at such low levels in transfected cells that we removed them from further consideration in our measurements (Table 1) . Of particular interest was nsp1-m5, which exhibited a statistically significant attenuation of inhibition of antiviral signaling while maintaining a strong inhibition of b-galactosidase expression, similar to that obtained with nsp1-wt. Variant nsp1-m5 phenotype of partial inhibition of host signaling with strong inhibition of bgalactosidase expression is consistent with our hypothesis that nsp1 exerts its pleiotropic inhibitory effects by interacting with more than one host protein. The inhibitory functions for all nsp1 mutants are shown in this table expressed as averaged percent compared to nsp1-wt (set to 100 percent). Percent inhibitions were also normalized to expression levels. No values are reported for mutants nsp1-m8, -m25, and -m26 as they had no significant inhibitory activities and were expressed at a level too low to be measured. After expression normalization, many nsp1 mutants exhibited increased inhibitory abilities compared to nsp1-wt; for example, nsp1-m19 exhibits nearly four-fold more inhibitory functions over nsp1-wt. Even after normalization, nsp1-m16 continues to show a loss of inhibition of host IFN-and virusdependent signaling while maintaining strong inhibition of host gene expression.

Variants nsp1-m16 (D33R, E36R, E37R, S40R) and nsp1-m17 (E41R, R43E, E44R, K47E) were selected for their immediate proximity to the residues mutated in nsp1-m5 to attempt to further separate the inhibition of antiviral signaling from the inhibition of host gene expression. Mutants nsp1-m17 and -m18 (incorporating both m16 and m17 mutations), were not significantly different from nsp1-m5 in their ability to inhibit the CAT reporter stimulation by IFN or SeV. By contrast, nsp1-m16 exhibited a complete loss of inhibition of antiviral signaling ( Figure 4A ), while maintaining strong inhibition of b-galactosidase expression ( Figure 4C ). In addition, mutations introduced in the intrinsically disordered C-terminal segment (amino acids 128-180) of nsp1, expressed relatively poorly (mutants nsp1-m12 and -m13) or barely at all (mutants nsp1-m25 and -m26, Figure 4D ). Mutant nsp1-m25 targeted the same residues as nsp1-m8, but instead of replacing the acidic residues with lysines, arginine residues were substituted to test the possibility that the lack of nsp1-m8 expression was due to ubiquitination of those lysines; rather, our results suggest that the charge change was sufficient to interfere with expression of nsp1. Variants nsp1-m25 and -m26 were consistently expressed at such very low levels in transfected cells, displaying no inhibitory activities, that we removed them from further consideration in our measurements (Table 1) .",

Expression of nsp1-m16 resulted in no decrease Figure 5 . Third round of mutagenesis refines map of nsp1 residues important for inhibition of host signaling or gene expression. SARS-CoV nsp1-m27 through nps1-m39 mutants were tested for (A) inhibition of host IFN-and virus-dependent signaling using the ISREx3-CAT reporter, followed by inhibition of host gene expression using (B) luciferase and (C) b-galactosidase assays. CAT activity values correspond to percent chloramphenicol acetylation using cell extracts diluted 100-fold, luciferase activity is determined in straight extracts and is expressed in RLU and bgalactosidase activity corresponds to released ortho-nitrophenol absorption at 405 nm using extracts diluted 10-fold. Mutants nsp1-m27 through nsp1-m30 were derived from nsp1-m16 to define minimal residues important for inhibition of host signaling. Immunoblots of nsp1 mutants are quantitated in (D). Error bars are 6 standard error; significance for all mutants is listed in Table 1 . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062416.g005 in either STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF3 dimerization, confirming the loss of antiviral signaling inhibition observed by CAT assay. Since nsp1-m16 retained the ability to inhibit gene expression, this mutation genetically separates the two inhibitory activities of SARS-CoV nsp1. By contrast, nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30, which showed increased inhibition of the CAT reporter, had wildtype or partially attenuated inhibition of antiviral signaling (Fig. 4) . Therefore, the increased inhibition of the CAT reporter by nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30 must be accounted for by an inhibitory effect on CAT mRNA expression, consistent with the observed increased inhibition of bgalactosidase and luciferase activities by these mutants. Table 1 is a compilation of all the nsp1 mutants generated in this study. Fold inhibition for nsp1-wt were 6.1, 1.6, 8.4 and 8.6, for b-galactosidase, luciferase, IFNa and SeV, respectively, and were set to 100 for ease of comparison. Point mutations in proteins often affect their expression levels by modulating transcription, mRNA stability, translation and/or protein stability, and we found this to be true for SARS-CoV nsp1 mutants as well. Since SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibitory activities are dose-dependent [16] , we additionally normalized the measured inhibition to the levels of expression for each mutant (Table 1) . Expression-normalized inhibition was used to classify the nsp1 mutants according to their ability to attenuate or increase inhibition of b-galactosidase expression and/or inhibition of antiviral signaling, leading to the identification of six broad groups, A-F, Table 1 (inhibition of luciferase expression was not considered as it was only reduced 1.6-fold by nsp1-wt). Group A mutant displayed partial attenuation of both gene expression and antiviral signaling; group B mutants had loss most inhibition of both gene expression and antiviral signaling; group C mutants; group C displayed differential effects on gene expression and signaling, with strongly reduced inhibition of signaling and maintained inhibition of gene expression; group D had increased inhibition of signaling and maintained inhibition of gene expression; group E displayed increased inhibition of both signaling and gene expression; and group F had no clear phenotype. Some mutants fell somewhat in between categories and are positioned at the edge of their groups.",

Their expression could be higher during virus infection because of less self-inhibition in that context, and thus their IFN antagonism may be correspondingly higher. Consistent with the possibility of selfinhibition in transfection experiments, it was recently shown that natural SARS-CoV NP subgenomic mRNA escapes nsp1mediated degradation, although translation of this mRNA is still inhibited by nsp1 [35] . This indicates some level of specificity for the targeting of mRNA degradation, but its molecular basis remains elusive. However, many mutants characterized in this study may be useful to elucidate the molecular basis of this function. Some mutations in SARS-CoV nsp1 changed the profile of the genes whose expression was affected: nsp1-wt strongly inhibited b-galactosidase expression but had little effect on the other genes, while other mutants showed increased luciferase inhibition with no change in b-galactosidase inhibition (e.g., nsp1-m22, -m37) and others also very strongly inhibited CAT expression (nsp1-m14, -m27, Figure 4 ).",

One of these host factors has been identified as the 40S subunit of the ribosome and can account for nsp1 inhibition of translation [26] . However, the factors responsible for increased mRNA degradation and for inhibition of signaling remain to be discovered. In addition, a recent two-hybrid screen identified a large number of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV nsp1, including several members of the immunophilin and calcipressin families [36] . This ability of SARS-CoV nsp1 to interact with multiple proteins despite its small size (180 residues) may be mediated in part by its disordered domains (a. a. 1-12, a.a.128-180 [32] ). Intrinsically disordered domains are present in numerous proteins and their structural plasticity allows them to adopt different partial or fully ordered conformations when interacting with different ligands, increasing the size of the repertoire of proteins with which they can interact [37] .",

            "text": "A number of viruses encode IFN antagonists that function nonspecifically to target a central cellular function such as transcription or translation to prevent expression of IFNs and IFNinducible genes. By contrast, other IFN antagonists specifically target IFN-or virus-dependent signaling, or IFN-induced proteins with antiviral function [4, 5] . In a first approximation, the mechanism by which IFN production/action are inhibited does not matter; the net result is a deficient IFN response. SARS-CoV nsp1 is unusual in that it inhibits gene expression and it inhibits both virus-and IFN-dependent signaling [16] . A mutant such as nsp1-m16, which lacks any ability to inhibit antiviral signaling while maintaining inhibition of gene expression, may prove useful to determine the relative importance of various inhibitory functions in evasion from the innate immune response and in overall virulence. Inhibition of signaling may be a more efficient strategy to antagonize the antiviral response than inhibition of gene expression due to the relative scarcity of signaling proteins vs. the abundance of components of the gene expression machinery, such as ribosomes. Thus, the levels of nsp1 necessary to inhibit a signaling target will be reached earlier during the replication cycle than those necessary to inhibit translation. The need for IFN antagonists to reach a threshold level before becoming effective is illustrated by the observation that at an early time point during SARS-CoV infection, IRF3 is observed to translocate to the nucleus whereas it is excluded from the nucleus at a later time point [38] .",

Indeed, even subtle changes in IFN basal and induced expression are associated with disease states [39] , and thus more selective inhibition of the induction of IFNs and IFN-inducible genes as observed with SARS-CoV may also impact the severity of the disease it causes. It has been shown that genes encoding inflammatory mediators are expressed at relatively much higher levels in SARS patients and in vitro tissue culture models than IFN genes when compared with other viral infections [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibitory effects on antiviral signaling [16] and its stimulatory effect on the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway [36] likely contribute to the increased production of inflammatory mediators in SARS patients. Such an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to a ''cytokine storm'' is thought to account at least in part for SARS-CoV morbidity and mortality [42, 43, 45, 36] .",

Consistent with such an evolutionary successful solution, several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have an established niche in humans and cause no or mild disease in healthy adults [7] [8] [9] 11, 12] . By contrast, SARS-CoV emergence in humans from another animal niche caused severe disease and even death in a substantial fraction of infected individuals [7] [8] [9] [10] . Significantly, several SARS-CoV nsp1 mutations increased its ability to function as an IFN antagonist (e.g., nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30, Figures 4&5 ). This increase was not due to increased inhibition of signaling ( Figure 6 ), but was due to increased inhibition of gene expression (b-galactosidase, luciferase and CAT, Figures 4&5) . Thus, our work indicates that a change in a few amino acids of SARS-CoV nsp1 was sufficient to substantially increase its overall IFN antagonism, which may lead to increase virulence. Comparable mutations may occasionally emerge in other human coronaviruses and lead to increased virulence, before selective pressure eventually eliminates such mutants. Other mutations tested decreased SARS-CoV nsp1 IFN antagonism and such mutations may have been part of SARS-CoV adaptation to the human population had it not been eradicated by public health measures.",

We hypothesized that surface residues would be important for interaction between nsp1 and host target protein(s) that would mediate the inhibitory effects of nsp1. Three rounds of mutagenesis targeting surface residues were carried out in this study (A-C). Mutant nsp1-m5 was identified to potentially mediate nsp1 inhibition of host IFN-and virus-dependent signaling (A) but not inhibition of host gene expression and was explored further. Mutant nsp1-m16 was generated to attempt to further resolve the nsp1-m5 loss of function, and mutants -m27 through -m30 (C) were generated to refine important residues identified in nsp1-m16 (B). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062416.g002",
