HCV replication cycle is closely tied to lipid metabolism and infection by this virus causes profound changes in host lipid homeostasis. We focused our attention on a phosphatidate phosphate (PAP) enzyme family (the lipin family), which mediate the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol in the cytoplasm, playing a key role in triglyceride biosynthesis and in phospholipid homeostasis. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The best-characterized member of this family is lipin1, which cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerophospholipid homeostasis in the liver. Lipin1-deficient cell lines were generated by RNAi to study the role of this protein in different steps of HCV replication cycle. Using surrogate models that recapitulate different aspects of HCV infection, we concluded that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of functional replicase complexes, in a step downstream primary translation that leads to early HCV RNA replication. Infection studies in lipin1-deficient cells overexpressing wild type or phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins suggest that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required to support HCV infection. Finally, ultrastructural and biochemical analyses in replication-independent models suggest that lipin1 may facilitate the generation of the membranous compartment that contains functional HCV replicase complexes.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important biomedical problem worldwide because it causes severe liver disease and cancer. Although immunological events are major players in HCV pathogenesis, interference with host cell metabolism contribute to HCV-associated pathologies. HCV utilizes resources of the cellular lipid metabolism to strongly modify subcellular compartments, using them as platforms for replication and infectious particle assembly. In particular, HCV induces the formation of a \"membranous web\" that hosts the viral machinery dedicated to the production of new copies of the viral genome. This lipid-rich structure provides an optimized platform for viral genome replication and hides new viral genomes from host\u00b4s antiviral surveillance. In this study, we have identified a cellular protein, lipin1, involved in the production of a subset of cellular lipids, as a rate-limiting factor for HCV infection. Our results indicate that the enzymatic activity of lipin1 is required to build the membranous compartment dedicated to viral genome replication. Lipin1 is probably contributing to the formation of the viral replication machinery by locally providing certain lipids required for an optimal membranous environment. Based on these results, interfering with lipin1 capacity to modify lipids may therefore constitute a potential strategy to limit HCV infection.",

Within this structure, HCV RNA replication is thought to occur in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum [15] [16] [17] . HCV replicase formation requires not only viral replicase components NS3 through NS5B [16] , but also recruitment and subversion of different key cellular factors that cooperate to provide an optimal membrane microenvironment for the assembly of HCV replicase complexes [11] . In this sense, HCV replicase complexes are located in characteristic detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) that cofractionate with caveolin-2 [18-20] and the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) [21] . These endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microdomains containing the viral replicase are enriched in cholesterol, probably by the direct involvement of cellular proteins involved in non-vesicular cholesterol transport [11] .",

Thus, HCV infection requires de novo biosynthesis of phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine (PC), in order to generate its membranous RNA replicase compartments [26] and TAG biosynthesis to ensure progeny virion production [12] .

Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to directly interact with promoter DNA-binding transcription factors to stimulate or repress transcription of lipogenic genes [30][31][32]. Two conserved motifs are required for phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) catalytic activity (DXDXT) and transcriptional regulation (LXXIL) respectively [31].

Interestingly, lipin1 deletion in the liver of fld mice, results in accumulation of lipin2 protein, a second member of the family predominantly expressed in the liver, which maintains normal cellular PAP activity and compensates some, but not all, aspects of glycerolipid metabolism [36]. Conversely, LPIN2 knock-out mice display increased lipin1 protein expression, as compared with wild type (wt) littermates, suggesting a similar homeostatic compensatory mechanism to maintain liver PAP activity [37]. Thus, lipin1 and lipin2 coordinate lipid homeostasis in the liver [37]. While individual LPIN1 or LPIN2 deletions are tolerated in mice, double knockout mice are embryonically lethal [37]. Despite this apparent functional redundancy, lipin1 is emerging as a key player in ethanol-induced steatosis [38] and a single nucleotide polymorphism in LPIN1 is associated with the severity of liver damage and fibrosis progression in pediatric human patients with histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [39] , suggesting that liver lipin1 dysfunction may contribute to steatosis-related liver pathogenesis.",

Chronic HCV infection is a major biomedical problem as it causes liver inflammation and fibrosis, which can lead to severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [2, 3] . There is no vaccine against HCV and, although blood-screening tests and other prophylactic measures have reduced the dissemination of this pathogen, a number of newly acquired infections still occur associated with risk behavior or with unknown origin [4, 5] . However, chronic HCV infection can be successfully eradicated from chronically infected individuals through specific direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapies, virtually in all treated patients [6] . Since these specific treatments have only been in place recently, there are no sufficient clinical data on the long-term benefit of these treatments in relieving the severity of advanced liver disease [7, 8] .",

Given that transcriptional activation of a subset of lipogenic genes during HCV infection is also prevented by addition of antioxidants [46] , we sought to determine if LPIN1 mRNA induction by HCV infection is mediated by ROS production and therefore dampened by NAC treatment. LPIN1 mRNA induction was prevented in the presence of the antioxidant (Fig 1E) , despite comparable HCV RNA accumulation in mock-treated and NAC-treated HCV-infected cells (Fig 1F) , suggesting that virus replicationinduced ROS production is required to induce LPIN1 mRNA accumulation.

Based on the data presented thus far, we hypothesized that lipin1 is limiting for a step in the HCV lifecycle downstream of HCV entry, leading to HCV RNA accumulation. To verify the hypothesis that lipin1 silencing causes strong reduction in initial HCV RNA accumulation by interfering with a step downstream of viral entry, we bypassed this step of the viral replication cycle by transfecting a subgenomic HCV RNA replicon bearing a reporter luciferase gene into control and lipin1-deficient cells. First, we evaluated HCV-IRES driven primary translation of incoming genomes by transfection of a replication-deficient mutant replicon that bears an inactivation mutation in the catalytic site of NS5B RNA polymerase [56] . Luciferase activity measured at 5 hours post-transfection was not reduced in any of the cell lines, indicating that transfection efficiency and HCV IRES-dependent primary translation was not significantly affected by lipin1 silencing (Fig 5B) . A significant increase in Renilla luciferase activity was observed in shLPIN1-1 cells both when transfecting a replicon ( Fig 5B) or a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase under a minimal RNA polymerase II promoter (S5A Fig), suggesting that the increase in luciferase activity observed in these cells is not related with HCV. HCV RNA replication was evaluated by measuring accumulation of a reporter luciferase gene at 5 and 48 hours post-transfection of a replication competent HCV subgenomic replicon. Under these experimental conditions luciferase accumulation at 5 hours also represents HCV IRES-driven primary translation of the input RNA, while reporter luciferase activity at 48 hours depends on effective HCV RNA replication. In contrast to primary translation, HCV RNA replication inferred by luciferase activity at 48 hours was strongly reduced in lipin1-deficient cells (90% in shLPIN1-1 and 99% in shLPIN1-2 cells) (Fig 5C) , indicating that initiation of HCV replication is dependent on normal lipin1 expression. This reduction was not due to a non-specific defect in luciferase expression, as co-transfection of a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase lead to comparable luciferase accumulation in all cell lines, discarding the possibility that death of transfected cells or other spurious effects are responsible for the reduced luciferase activity accumulation (S5A Fig) . Similar experiments were conducted in ATG4B-deficient cells, as this host factor was shown to be limiting for primary HCV translation [57] . Our studies confirmed that, while partial ATG4B silencing (S5B Fig Overall, these data indicate that HCV RNA replication is not initiated efficiently in lipin1-deficient cells and that blockade occurs at a step downstream translation of incoming HCV genomes.",

Control and lipin1-deficient cells were transfected with wt lipin1 beta cDNA as well as with DXDXT and LXXIL mutants. Comparable overexpression levels of the wt and mutant proteins was obtained in each cell line, although overexpressed lipin1 levels were consistently higher in lipin1-deficient cells (Fig 6A) . Cells were subsequently inoculated with HCV D183 at MOI 10 and relative infection efficiency was calculated by determining extracellular infectivity titers 48 hours post-infection. Overexpression of wt lipin1 did not significantly alter susceptibility to HCV infection in control cells, although we observed a small but consistent reduction in extracellular infectivity titers when overexpressing wt and mutant lipin1 constructs (S6A Fig Using relative infection efficiency as readout of this set of experiments, we could clearly observe a statistically significant increase (2-fold) in the relative infection susceptibility in cells overexpressing wt lipin1 cDNA as compared with mock-transfected cells or cells expressing similar or higher levels of the mutants (Fig 6A) , suggesting that wt lipin1 modestly, though significantly, rescues HCV infection while phosphatase (DXDXT) and transcriptional coactivation (LXXIL) mutants do not ( Fig 6B) . These results suggest that lipin1 transcriptional coactivation capacity is not sufficient to support HCV infection while lipin1 phosphatase activity is essential. However, given that LXXIL mutant is deficient both in transcriptional co-activation and PAP activity [31], we cannot determine if transcriptional co-activation by lipin1 is also required to support HCV infection.",

            "text": "To validate the TEM results independently, we set out to establish a biochemical assay to evaluate replication-independent replicase complex formation. One of the characteristics of the HCV replicase complexes is that they are located in detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) [19, 20] . In this sense, NS proteins are associated with replicase complexes that co-sediment with DRM markers such as caveolin-2 or sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in low-density fractions in isopycnic gradient ultracentrifugation experiments [19, 21] . Control and lipin1deficient cells were infected with VacT7 and subsequently transfected with limiting doses of the plasmid pTM-NS3/5B [16] . Parallel samples were treated with DCTV (100 nM). Sixteen hours post-transfection, cell lysates were generated and subjected to equilibrium ultracentrifugation in 10-40% sucrose gradients. Gradient fractions were collected and subjected to Western-Blot analysis to determine the impact of lipin1 silencing on NS3, SIGMAR1 and actin sedimentation profiles. Fig 8A shows how, as previously shown for replicon and JFH1-infected cells, NS3 can be detected in DRM fractions (fractions 3-5), as determined by the presence of SIGMAR1 in those fractions (fractions 3-5; S8A Fig), although in this experimental system, unlike during viral infection [21] , most NS3 co-sediments together with solubilized proteins, as shown for actin (fractions 9-12; S8A Fig) . DRM-associated NS3 is reduced in DCTV-treated and lipin1-deficient cells, while total NS3 expression remains unchanged (Fig 8A) . Four independent experiments were performed in which relative-DRM associated NS3, normalized to that found in solubilized fractions, was calculated for each experimental condition (Fig 8B) . Lipin1-deficient cells display a consistent and statistically significant reduction in the DRMassociated, but not total NS3 abundance (Fig 8A and 8B; shLPIN1-1 and shLPIN1-2) , similar to that observed in control cells in the presence of DCTV (Figs 8A and 8B; shControl+DCTV) , consistent with the TEM data (Figs 7 and S7 ) and the notion that NS3 in DRM fractions may reflect the abundance of replicase complexes formed in these cells. This reduction is not due to an overall reduction in cellular DRM abundance in lipin1-deficient cells, as lipin1-deficient cells display similar SIGMAR1 distribution pattern as the control cells (S8 Fig). Overall, TEM data and DRM floatation assays strongly suggest that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of replicase complexes from fully processed polyprotein subunits.",

Thus, it is likely that stimulation of one or several of these regulatory networks by HCV infection results in the LPIN1 mRNA transcriptional activation observed in this ( Fig 1A) and other studies [40, 41] . Importantly, prevention of LPIN1 mRNA accumulation with NAC ( Fig 1E) did not significantly interfere with HCV RNA replication (Fig 1F) , suggesting that enhanced LPIN1 mRNA accumulation is not required for efficient HCV infection. We favor the hypothesis that ROS induced by HCV protein accumulation actively participates in LPIN1 induction, as treatment with the antioxidant NAC prevented LPIN1 mRNA accumulation, similar to what has been shown for other SREBP-regulated genes during HCV infection [46] . Accumulation of LPIN1 mRNA during HCV infection results in concomitant protein accumulation (Fig 1G and 1H) . However, post-translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation, acetylation or sumoylation regulate lipin1 protein stability, membrane association as well as subcellular localization thus influencing the activity of lipin1 as PA-phosphatase and as transcriptional coactivator [70] . Hence, it is difficult to predict the implications of lipin1 protein accumulation during HCV infection. Thus, future studies on the interference of HCV infection with cellular lipin1 functions will be required to determine its role in HCV-related pathogenesis, particularly in its contribution to steatosis. Lipin1 is required for HCV replicase formation The data presented in this study provide evidence that lipin1 is rate limiting for HCV infection at an early step of the infection leading to formation of membranous HCV replicase complexes, downstream of viral polyprotein expression and processing. We provide evidence for reduced accumulation of viral RNA during single cycle infection experiments (Fig 2D) , that is reminiscent of a faulty initiation of viral replication, as suggested by reduced replication of a transfected subgenomic replicon in lipin1-deficient cells (Fig 5D) . Data obtained in replication-independent polyprotein expression models suggest that generation of the membranous compartment that contains functional replicase complexes is severely limited in lipin1-deficient cells, as suggested by a significant reduction of the fraction of cells where these structures could be visualized by TEM (Figs 7 and S7 ). This hypothesis is further supported by a significant reduction in DRM-associated NS proteins in lipin1-deficient cells (Fig 8) , which may reflect limitations in the association of viral replicase subunits with cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich membranes in lipin1-deficient cells [19, 20, 71] .",

            "text": "Four different shRNAs targeting LPIN1 mRNA decrease susceptibility to HCV infection proportionally to their ability to reduce total lipin1 protein accumulation (Fig 4) . These results, together with the cDNA rescue experiments (Fig 6) , strongly reduce the possibility of observing RNAi-associated off-target phenomena. Interestingly, homeostatic accumulation of lipin2 protein in lipin1-deficient cells (Fig 2A and 2B) is not sufficient to compensate for lipin1 loss to support efficient HCV infection. The notion that, despite being capable of mutually compensating basic liver functions [36, 37], lipin1 and lipin2 play non-redundant functions in the liver has previously been proposed [36, 72, 73] . Lipin1 is tightly regulated at many different levels and its activity accommodates PAP activity in response to different physiological situations such as fasting and insulin signaling [70] . Compelling evidence indicates that, while lipin1 and lipin2 cooperate to maintain liver lipid homeostasis, the two proteins differ in many aspects. For instance, lipin1 is transcriptionally induced by PGC-1\u03b1 and it is also an inducible amplifier of this transcriptional network [31], whereas lipin2 is not [36] . Lipin1 is sumoylated and sumoylation regulates its nuclear localization and function, whereas lipin2 sumoylation could not be demonstrated, despite the presence of a canonical sumoylation motif in its primary sequence [74] . Lipin1 enzymatic activity is blocked by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent phosphorylation in response to different metabolic stimuli [30, 75], whereas lipin2 is constitutively active even when phosphorylated [76] . Thus, lipin2 is considered more as a constitutive phosphatidic acid phosphatase with lower specific activity than lipin1 [76] . In addition to these differential regulatory networks, it has been shown that in vitro PAP activity of purified lipin1 and lipin2 is differentially influenced by the composition of the substrates (liposomes and lipid-detergent micelles) as well as the pH at which the assay is performed [76] . This differential lipid substrate recognition may be reminiscent of the different preferential association with membranes of different subcellular compartments (S1 Fig) [73, 76] . These differences suggest that, while lipin1 and lipin2 may share some common features, they are not functionally interchangeable, particularly not in the case of HCV infection [70] . Our data support the notion that lipin1 silencing has a strong impact on HCV infection without affecting basic cellular functions (Fig 2B) or significantly interfering with infection by an unrelated virus (S3 Fig). Despite great efforts and different overexpression systems, functional rescue of lipin1 functions by wt lipin1 cDNA overexpression in lipin1-deficient cells only lead to a small but consistent rescue of virus infection efficiency, which was only observed when overexpressing wt lipin1 (Figs 6 and S6) . Given the multiple transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation levels existing for lipin1 expression, it is conceivable that only a fraction of the overexpressed lipin1 is fully competent to sustain HCV infection. Moreover, high overexpression levels could only be achieved in lipin1-deficient cells (Fig 6A) , underscoring the notion that intracellular lipin1 levels are tightly regulated by the host. Nevertheless, overexpression of a mutant lipin1 lacking phosphatase activity (DXDXT) or a mutant inactive as transcriptional coactivator (LXXIL) were not capable of enhancing HCV infection in lipin1-deficient cells as compared with the wt lipin1 ( Fig 6B) . These data reveal that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required for lipin1 to support HCV infection and suggest that, while transcriptional co-activation by lipin1 may be important, this function is not sufficient to support HCV replication.",

            "text": "Lipins are important enzymes in the main pathway for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis by providing DAG derived from the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway to produce PC and PE through the Kennedy pathway [70] . Production of membranous replicase compartments likely requires de novo synthesis of PC and/or PE, which are major components of biological membranes that depend on DAG biosynthesis [29] . In fact, local PC biosynthesis is required for efficient replication of (+) RNA viruses and certain PC species accumulate in HCV-infected cells [26, 28] . Although increased lipin2 accumulation may be sufficient to compensate lipin1 silencing at the whole-cell level [37], it is possible that acute, local demand of de novo synthesized phospholipids is required at defined suborganellar compartments during early steps of HCV infection and that lipin1-deficiency shortens or alters the availability of different membrane components, demand that may not be satisfied by lipin2, given the differential regulation [76] and subcellular localization of these two proteins (S2 Fig). Remarkably, deletion of the yeast lipin homologs pah1/smp2 (S. cerevisae) or ned1 (S. pombe) gene, results in deregulated proliferation of the ER and nuclear envelope membranes [77, 78] , with concomitant enhancement in (+) RNA virus replication [79, 80] . The membranous alterations and elevation of total phospholipid content observed in pah1-deficient yeast have been ascribed to transcriptional activation of pah1-independent alternative phospholipid biosynthetic programs due to PA accumulation [77, 80] . Our data in mammalian cells are more compatible with a shortage of phospholipid production, which may be at the basis of the reduced abundance viral membranous structure (Figs 7 and 8) . This opposite outcomes of infection may derive from the fact that yeast use mainly PA (lipin1 PAP substrate) as a precursor for PC biosynthesis, while mammals mainly use DAG (lipin1 PAP product) as precursor for PC biosynthesis through the Kennedy pathway [77, [80] [81] [82] . Moreover, in contrast to yeast and lower eukaryotes, which express only one lipin gene, three different lipin genes coordinate glycerolipid homeostasis in mammals [72] . Thus, interfering with expression of one of the members of the family may not be sufficient to observe the same effects observed when deleting pah1, as transcriptional and posttranslational homeostatic compensations are in place in mammals, particularly between lipin1 and lipin2 in liver tissue [36, 37] . In this sense, deletion of either lipin1 or lipin2 in mouse models results in a relatively balanced liver phospholipid content while simultaneous deletion of both lipins is embryonically lethal [37] . Accordingly, only minor alterations of ER membranes [83] and no significant alterations in total PC levels [36] have been reported in lipin1-deficient mouse liver. Given the fact that hCoV-229E is fully capable of replicating in these cells (S3 Fig), it is unlikely that a general disruption of de novo phospholipid biosynthesis occurs in lipin1-deficient cells, particularly since hCoV-229E infection also induces profound ER membrane rearrangements required for replication [84] , some of which are structurally similar to DMVs observed during HCV infection [85] . Thus, we favor the hypothesis that a subcellular pool of glycerophospholipids is managed by lipin1 in Huh-7 cells and that lipin1 silencing perturbs local levels of PA and DAG, limiting local availability of precursors of structural components of virus-induced membranes.",

            "text": "Alternatively, lipin1 deficiency may alter local amounts of important signaling molecules, in particular, that of its substrate (PA) or its product (DAG). Deregulation of the local PA and DAG pools may cause important alterations for the host cell, as both metabolites are potent chemical messengers that regulate different aspects of cellular homeostasis [86] [87] [88] . Regarding PA conversion into DAG by lipins, it has been shown that pah1 (yeast lipin1 homolog) phosphatase activity is critical for transforming local pools of PA into DAG at the ER membrane to facilitate membrane fusion events mediated by SNARE complexes [89, 90] . Mammalian lipin1 phosphatase activity is also critical for transforming local pools of PA that accumulate at the surface of mitochondria to promote mitochondrial fission [91] or at the surface of endolysosomes to facilitate autophagy [92] . Thus, lipin1 and probably other members of the lipin family modulate different aspects of intracellular membrane signaling. Given that the function of host factors known to be involved in functional HCV replicase biogenesis, like VAPA, VAPB and OSBP [11] are indirectly regulated by local PA/DAG pools [93] , it is tempting to propose that lipin1 silencing interferes with the function of one or several of these, or other yet uncharacterized cellular factors. In contrast to what has been reported for other host factors required for HCV replicase complex formation [58] , we did not find evidence of lipin1 protein relocalization during HCV infection (S1 Fig). Thus, determining the precise mechanism by which lipin1 regulates HCV replicase formation is challenging, as association of lipin1 with different cell membranes is transient and highly regulated by posttranslational modifications [70] . Moreover, some of the known lipin1 cellular functions may be compensated by other lipins, particularly lipin2 in the liver. Nevertheless, our data clearly indicate that lipin1 participates at early stages of HCV replication and that the aforementioned homeostatic compensations by other lipins in regards to cellular metabolism may constitute an advantage when considering lipin1 as a host target for anti-HCV therapy.",
