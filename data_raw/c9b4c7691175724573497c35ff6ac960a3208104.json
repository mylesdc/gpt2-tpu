The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis. Materials and methods. This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in patients with and without G6PD deficiency. Results. The prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.03). WBCs number and neutrophils percentages in G6PD deficient patients compared with patients without G6PD deficiency were decreased, but were not statistically significant (p=0.77 and p=0.86 respectively). Conclusions. G6PD deficiency is a risk factor of neonatal sepsis and also a justification for more male involvement in this disease. Therefore, newborn screening for this disorder is recommended.",

The early-onset sepsis usually results from organisms acquired intrapartum but lateonset sepsis is usually acquired from the environment [1, 3] . Neonatal sepsis occurs in one to four cases per 1000 live births in the developed countries, while it has been 10 times greater in many developing countries [4] . Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, coagulasenegative Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis [5] . The medical advances in the treatment of sepsis reduce the incidence of mortality from 90% to 15-30%. Diagnosis of neonatal sepsis remains one of the challenges that pediatrics are facing, because clinical findings are nonspecific and vague [4] .",

While a positive blood culture is still a gold standard of sepsis diagnosis, the preparation of results take time and there are possibilities of contamination, false-positive and false-negative results [7] . Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is one of the enzymes of many organisms including humans, which is expressed in all tissues and plays a key role in the process of glucose metabolism [8] . G6PD catalyzes the first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway that converts glucose to pentose carbohydrates. In addition to this reaction, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is produced [4] . One function of NADPH is the reduction of glutathione.

We hypothesized that one of the reasons for the higher prevalence of sepsis among male neonates may be due to G6PD deficiency. Since the G6PD deficiency is the most common genetic defect in the world and its mode of inheritance is x-linked recessive, many male newborns were affected [20] . On the other hand, as this study showed, the frequency of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was higher than in controls. Therefore, we concluded that the G6PD deficiency is one of the reasons for the higher neonates' susceptibility of developing sepsis, so, G6PD deficiency can be considered a risk factor of male neonatal sepsis.",

Cooper and colleagues reported that the G6PD deficiency is associated with the decrease in the production of ROS in WBCs of patients, which increases the overall chance of the infection [22] . The other possible mechanisms that might explain the increased prevalence of sepsis among G6PD-deficient neonates was increased serum iron concentration due to lysis of erythrocytes. Some studies showed a relationship between the elevation of blood iron (hyperferremia) and serious infections. For example, the increased prevalence of sepsis in the meningitis patient as a result of intramuscular injection of iron was reported [23] .",

In general, the number of leukocytes increased during sepsis (leukocytosis), but in some cases, the number of leukocytes is reduced [25] . This study showed that the number of the WBCs in the G6PD deficient patients was lower compared to the patients without enzyme deficiency; however, this decrease was not significant. Hsieh and colleagues demonstrated that the G6PD deficient epithelial cells infected with Staphylococcus aureus compared to normal infected epithelial cells have an accumulation of more oxidants and a higher apoptosis rate during infection [21] . This may be due to the decrease in NADPH production as a result of G6PD deficiency, which prevents the effective neutralization of oxidants. It can be assumed that during the sepsis, neutrophils phagocytosis of bacteria and respiratory burst reactions occur. However, because of G6PD deficiency, not enough NADPH is produced to neutralize all the oxidants produced. Therefore, these oxidants cause damage and apoptosis of neutrophils. However, due to the small sample size and the lack of measurement of NADPH, this conclusion is not conclusive and the repeating of this study with a larger population and measurement of NADPH levels is recommended.",
