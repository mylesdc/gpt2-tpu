            "text": "Heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels. Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models' realism. Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment. Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings. Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with workplace contacts being least assortative. These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model. Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases. This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet available.",

            "text": "Events over the last decade have highlighted the threat posed internationally by contact-transmissible infectious diseases such as hand, foot and mouth disease [1, 2] , MERS-CoV [3] , Ebola [4] , influenza [5] , and Tuberculosis [6] , putting pressure on governments and public health institutes [6] to ensure countries are pandemic-prepared. Research in social networks has shown that transmissibility, and hence the effectiveness of many interventions, is determined by the intensity of human-to-human interactions [12] . Heterogeneities in contact networksin the sense of clustering of contacts within triadic structures and the existence of individuals or groups with many more contacts than average-has been shown in modelling studies (i) to have an effect on determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic [7] [8] [9] or can persist at endemic levels [10] , (ii) to exert selective pressure for low virulence [11] , and (iii) to determine which interventions can possibly mitigate an outbreak [8, [12] [13] [14] or even eradicate a disease from the population [13] . While epidemic models that do not account for contact structure suffice for some research questions, such as prediction [15] or determining minimum vaccine coverage if there are no pockets of high transmission intensity or low coverage [16] [17] [18] [19] , assessing the effectiveness of interventions that specifically target social networks, such as school closure [20] [21] [22] , requires models that explicitly account for such social structure. Determining contact patterns within and between different segments of the population is therefore vital to evidence-based prediction and planning with sufficient realism to inform good policy making.",

The study illuminated the strong assortativity of social contacts with age, with children in particular driving the early period of an epidemic, a finding that has been reproduced in other studies [24] . Similar studies to measure the assortativity of contacts have been conducted in a few other locations: Viet Nam [25] , Taiwan [26] , southern China [27] , Peru [28] South Africa [29] , Kenya [30] , Russia [31] and Thailand [32] . However, the age and social structure of countries with different levels of socioeconomic development, family structure and at different stages of demographic transition differ substantially and contact patterns concomitantly vary across countries. The findings from the POLYMOD and limited number of other countries cannot therefore be directly applied to models of socially-transmitted infections, such as influenza, in other settings [32] . The lack of reliable contact studies in most of the world almost a decade after the original POLYMOD study highlights the logistical challenges of conducting such studies, particularly in low income countries which account for most of the infectious disease burden globally [33] . Although it is preferable for models in such a country to be based on empirical contact data from that country directly, in the absence of such data, modelers have to decide how to modify estimates from another country to fill the gap.",

However, because the POLYMOD survey collected information on where each contact occurred, a more refined projection can be obtained by incorporating data on household structures, labor-force participation rates, and school enrolment, and separately projecting contacts in different locations.

Fig 1 gives an overview of the data sources discussed in the following section, and the major steps of the modelling framework described in the sections that follow that. The countries (n = 152, 95.9% of the world's population) are categorized into (i) POLYMOD, (ii) Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and (iii) Rest of the World (ROW) countries, which are illustrated on the world map. Data availability, as used in our study, varies across the country categories: with POLYMOD having the most data available and the ROW countries having the least. The quality of the data from the same source is consistent across countries. The modelling framework starts with a Bayesian hierarchical model (A) built for the POLYMOD contact data. This model estimates age-and location-specific contact rates for the POLYMOD countries collectively and independently. The ensuing subsections detail the methodology adopted to construct age-structured populations at home, work, and school (B) is combined with the population age structure and the POLYMOD aggregated estimates to get the global projections (C). Internal validation using leave-one-out validation was conducted to verify that the household age matrices describing household structure could be reverse-engineered for countries (POLYMOD and DHS) for which empirical household age matrices were available. Not featured in this flowchart are the external validation and an example application (i.e. age-specific Susceptible-Infected-Removed modelling) that demonstrates the potential utility of these projections.",

For two pandemic influenza scenarios (R 0 = 1.2 and 1.5), the age-specific final epidemic size and the percent reduction in infection were calculated for three scenarios: No intervention (total contacts calculated as a sum of contacts made at home, work, school and other), School closure and social distancing of younger individuals (zero contribution from school contacts and reduction in contacts at other locations with individuals below 20 years and a small increase in contacts made at home) and Workplace distancing (reduction of work contacts by a half). These were obtained by scaling the contact matrices to obtain the scenario's R 0 , setting the removal rate without loss of generality to one. We initialize the SIR model with starting immunity levels derived from age-specific susceptibility data from the study by Miller et al. [40] . More details are in the S1 Text.

A near linear relationship is observed between the household size and the number of contacts, suggesting a frequency dependent relationship, rather than a density dependent one [41] . The age-specific contact patterns at home, including with visitors to the household, for the POLYMOD countries collectively are presented in Fig 2, stratified by household size. A central diagonal is present for all household sizes, indicating assortativity of mixing with age, with secondary diagonals in households with at least 2 Global projected contact matrices members. These secondary diagonals become more prominent with increasing household sizes.",

For all three countries, both the household age matrices (panels d-f) and age-specific contact patterns at home (panels g-i) have similar features: (i) a prominent central diagonal corresponding to interactions with siblings (for younger individuals) and partners (for adults) and (ii) two parallel secondary ridges about one generation distant from the main diagonal, which start around age 25 and reflect parent-child contacts. Together, these suggest that the contacts are dominated by two-generation familial structures for these three countries, although other countries such as India display evidence of three-generational structures. Results for India and 151 other countries are presented in the S1 Text.

Glass and Glass [24] found similar assortativity among younger age groups, and proposed that this assortativity made those in younger age groups the transmission backbone of respiratory epidemics. Simulation studies using the POLYMOD data [23] and others [26, 45, 46 ] support this conclusion and explain why children and teenagers were the major channels for the initial transmission of infection during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic [47] , and why school closure is one of the main non-pharmaceutical interventions considered for pandemic mitigation [20, 48] . Merler et al. found that spatiotemporal spread of the H1N1 2009 pandemic in Europe were influenced by the age-mixing patterns and social structures [49] . While age-mixing patterns shape the transmission of infectious disease [49] , analyses of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [50, 51] suggest that it is crucial to account for age-specific susceptibility to infection.",

            "text": "For most of the countries considered, three pronounced diagonal bands were observed in the contact matrices at home. This is partly a reflection of the structure found in the POLY-MOD survey itself [23] , but is also consistent with the much larger DHS surveys which provide detailed data on household structures directly [52] . For the Asian countries in the DHS samples, noticeable tertiary diagonals, reflecting three generation households, were present, which highlight the limitations of using data from Europe to represent non-European societies without adjustments similar to those performed in this analysis. Interactions between school-going children and the elderly have important public health implications, as the former may have high infection rates while the latter are vulnerable to complications from infections, such as pneumonia [53, 54] . Evidence for the effect of transmission from children to the elderly comes from Japan, where the cessation of the school influenza vaccination program led to a rise in mortality among the elderly [55] . Although we have used contact data only from the POLY-MOD to build the global contact matrices, contact studies in Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (from Viet Nam [25] , Taiwan [26] , Southern China [27] , Peru [28] , South Africa [29] and Kenya [30] , Russia [31] ) found similar evidence of tertiary diagonals in the contact matrices at home. The consistency of their survey-based findings with the emergent properties of our model provides some degree of empirical support to our findings. Synthetic contact matrices have been generated by individual-based model simulations [56] or derived from socio-demographic variables [57, 58] and validated on serological data of H1N1 Influenza [56, 58] , varicella and parvo-virus [57] using age-structured SIR models. Some of these synthetic contact matrices were created for only one country (Hong Kong [56] and Italy [57] ), while Ref. [58] estimated contact matrices for 26 European countries. The Fumanelli estimates [58] in particular did not reproduce the narrowness of the leading diagonal in the contact matrix observed in the POLY-MOD study, in contrast to our approach (more in the S1 Text). Despite the lack of social contact surveys, synthetic contact matrices have only developed for higher-incomed countries [56] [57] [58] [59] , with large proportions lower-and-middle-income countries unrepresented.",

We assumed the number of contacts in each location was Poisson, with over-dispersal accounted for using an individual-level random effect term that was assumed to govern contacts in all four locations, but in principle additional heterogeneities might be present leading to mischaracterization of correlations, dispersion [60] , and the number of zeros. As in the original POLYMOD study, we only quantified age-specific dyadic contacts, as eliciting higher order contacts in a survey is challenging both cognitively and practically. Triadic contacts-where A contacts B contacts C contacts A-are important for disease propagation in contact network models [12, 61] and other methods to measure these, such as radio frequency tagging [61, 62] , or more sophisticated structural models accounting temporal presence within the household [63] , may be needed to characterize higher degrees of contact. However, it remains to be demonstrated empirically that the differences in the patterns of transmission of an infection between two countries can be explained by differences in their contact patterns, although our simulation study in three countries suggested that the effect of interventions can vary substantially based solely on changes in contacts driven by age structure. The short simulation study in this paper made simplistic assumptions about how social distancing measures would translate into a reduction in contact rates, as well as assuming that heterogeneities in contact patterns could be well-described by an age-structured but otherwise mean-field model. In actual usage, the translation of a policy into a specific change in contact rates should be supported by evidence, while individual-based simulation models [64] provide a more flexible framework to capture shared contacts between individuals and allows policies such as reactive school closure to be assessed [65] .",

For households, this involved identifying similarity to countries for which household data were available (using POLYMOD or DHS), using a mixture of indicators on the economy and demography of each country, and applying a mapping from the age pyramids of countries to their household structure. The variables used gave more weight to pairs of countries that for the most part make intuitive sense (for instance, Germany (POLYMOD) is assigned high weight in constructing Austria's (ROW) contact matrices). This approach did, however, mean excluding several small countries with missing information, covering 4.1% of the world's population. The variables were arbitrarily selected to span measures of health and social structure (fertility, mortality, growth, and health expenditure), as well as development (income, internet penetration and urbanization). The scree plot of the eigenvalue decomposition of these variables suggested that beyond 4 or 5 dimensions, additional variables did not add much new information, but alternative measures of distance would have resulted in some differences in the projected matrices. On validation, although there were some systematic discrepancies (for instance, the slightly off-center leading diagonal for some Asian countries, which we suspect might be corrected by accounting for gender in future work), this approach reconstructed the empirical household structures with otherwise high accuracy for both the POLYMOD and DHS countries. We had substantially less data on potential school and work contacts, because direct samples from these environments were not available, even in POLYMOD, and so the approach extrapolated from indirect measures (workforce and school participation rates, teacher to student ratios). This means that the number and age-profile of contacts outside the home are inherently less well projected by our approach than those within the home. It is not clear how this approach could be improved for these location types, or for 'other' locations, however, without collecting substantial amounts of new data. The original POLYMOD study found highly assortative mixing in 'other' locations, and while the study in Russia [31] found a similar pattern, it is not clear whether this would be observed in other, non-European or Eurasian settings.",

            "text": "The second major modelling step was to project from POLYMOD to non-POLYMOD countries the relationship between (i) household structure or workforce/school participation and (ii) contact rates within those locations. This approach implicitly assumes that given a potential contact in a given location (for instance, the existence of a cohabitant), the chance of an actual interaction is the same in POLYMOD and non-POLYMOD countries. The approximate validity of this assumption is supported by the broad similarities between our projections and estimates from the limited number of contact studies conducted outside Europe [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , but some discrepancies were found in this validation. It is unclear to what extent these are due to violations of the assumptions made in this paper, due to differences in study design-such as interviewer-versus self-administered questionnaires, or translation effects-or due to differences between study populations and the country as a whole due to recruitment in a limited geographical area. Further empirical studies in other countries would provide additional validation.",
