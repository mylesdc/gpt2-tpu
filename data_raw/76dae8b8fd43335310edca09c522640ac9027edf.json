Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N-and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol.",

The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N-and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an ''open'' conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a ''closed'' conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment.",

MHV strain A59 is an extensively studied group II coronavirus [4, 5] that causes enteritis, hepatitis, and central nervous system demyelination in susceptible mice [6, 7] . Translation of the MHV-A59 genome yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are encoded by two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF) termed ORF1a and ORF1b. Expression of ORF1b requires a (21) ribosomal frameshift to yield two large polyproteins, pp1a (495 kDa) and pp1ab (803 kDa) [8, 9] . The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are cotranslationally and post-translationally processed by two papainlike proteases domains in nsp3, named PLP1 and PLP2, and the main protease nsp5 (Mpro) into 16 non-structural proteins [10, 11, 12, 13] . These non-structural proteins are proposed to form a membrane-anchored replication complex for RNA replication and transcription [14, 15] .",

Van der Meer and colleagues demonstrated that MHV RNA synthesis and genome replication occur on late endosomal or lysosomal membranes [20] . In contrast, Gosert and coworkers reported that the MHV replication complex is localized to the cellular double membrane vesicles (DMVs); the RNA synthesis, replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription also take place in the cytoplasmic DMVs [21] . It was further demonstrated that the autophagic pathway is required for formation of virus induced double membrane vesicles, and formation of DMVs significantly enhances the efficiency of MHV replication [22] . An electron microscopy study also revealed the involvement of DMVs in formation of the SARS coronavirus replication complex; the DMVs were labeled by several nsps and viral RNA, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was identified as the most likely membrane donor of SARS-CoV induced membrane structures [14] . Thus, it is generally believed that coronavirus replication takes places on the cytoplasmic DMVs, the membranes of which originate from the ER [23] . However, the mechanism of interaction between the replication complex and membranes are unclear and require further investigation.",

Of the 16 coronavirus non-structural proteins, only nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are known to possess trans-membrane domains [2, 8, 24, 25, 26] and are proposed to be involved in the interaction of replication complex with the cytoplasmic membranes, either as membrane anchors or as scaffolds for the replication complex [26, 27] . Membrane topology studies concerning SARS and MHV hydrophobic domains of non-structural proteins have revealed that nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 all have a Nendo/Cendo topology, with both the amino and carboxy terminus exposing to the cytoplasm; furthermore, two of the three hydrophobic domains of nsp3, four hydrophobic domains of nsp4 and six of the seven hydrophobic domains of nsp6 are membrane spanning [26] . These trans-membrane domains comprise of the majority part of the polyprotein pp1a, which are generally believed to mediate the assembly and targeting of replication complex to cytoplasmic membranes [28, 29, 30] , while the ORF1b-encoded proteins (nsp12-nsp16) are directly involved in coronavirus RNA replication and transcription [15, 31] .",

MHV nsp4 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane when expressed alone and recruited to the replication complex in infected cells, its amino and carboxy termini are exposed to the cytosol, while the Nglycosylated region is located between the first and second TM regions and faces the ER luminal side [25] . Substitution of the MHV nsp4 glycosylation site N237 to alanine is lethal for virus replication, while the temperature sensitive mutant N258T virus leads to a dramatic reduction in DMVs assembly at nonpermissive temperature, indicating a critical role for nsp4 in coronavirus DMVs assembly [32] . Further virus recovery analysis of several deletion mutants of MHV nsp4 revealed that it is required for viral replication: the putative TMs1-3 and specific charged residues are essential for productive virus infection, while TM4 and the carboxy terminal amino acids K398-T492 are dispensable [33] . It is evident that nsp4 plays important role in coronavirus replication and DMVs formation, and that the TM regions of nsp4 are involved in association of the coronavirus replication complex with cellular membranes. However, our understanding of the functional role of nsp4 is still at an early stage, and there has been no structural characterization of the coronavirus nsp4 to date.",

The highly conservation of this fragment among all coronavirus species and its involvement in assembly of the DMVs suggests that this cytoplasmic fragment of nsp4 may play an important role in coronavirus replication complex assembly. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59, together with the structure of a C425S site-directed mutant. The structure covers an 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 and is shown to possess a new fold. Two wild-type monomers in one asymmetric unit are linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond to form a dimer, which could be observed and easily dissociate in reducing solution in vitro. Mutagenesis of Cys425 to Ser broke the disulfide bond, but two mutant monomers interact with each other via their cross-linked C-termini to form a strikingly different ''close'' conformation compared to the ''open'' conformation of the wild-type dimer, in which the C-termini of the wild-type monomers are oppositely oriented. Through analysis of these two conformations of the dimer and the cellular localization of nsp4C, we conclude that nsp4C exists as a monomer in the cytosol. This structure may serve as a basis for the functional studies of nsp4 from coronaviruses, thus providing preliminary structural insights into the membrane anchoring of coronavirus nsp4.",

In the WT nsp4C structure, two monomers in one asymmetric unit are linked by a 2.0 \u00c5 Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond to form a dimer (Fig. 1 ). The C-terminal of nsp4 is exposed to the cytosol, suggesting that the nsp4C should bind to the ER membrane via its N-terminal. Notably, the N-termini of the two molecules are not aligned in the WT nsp4C dimer. Instead, they are projected in different orientations, with one molecule rotated by about 150u around the y-axis relative to the other molecule (Fig. 1) . The N-terminal amino acids Cys425, Lys421, Glu422, Lys426, and Asn429 are located in the contact surface between the two monomers. The hydrophobic cavity of WT nsp4C is exposed on the dimer surface, and the C-termini of the two monomers extend in different orientations. We propose that the surface properties of the WT nsp4C dimer are representative of an ''open'' conformation given that its positive, negative and hydrophobic areas are all exposed (Fig. 1 ). This conformation is in conflict with the hypothesis that nsp4C binds to the membrane as a dimer via their N-termini; it is rational only if nsp4C binds the membrane as a monomer.",

The mutant C425S dimer could be obtained by crystallographic symmetry of the WT nsp4C structure (Fig 3D) . In WT nsp4C, a disulfide bond at Cys425 causes the C-termini of the two monomers to extend in different orientations, and thus resulting in flexibility and undetectable electron density differences at the C-termini of the monomers. In the case of the C425S mutant, the disulfide bond is dissociated and the dimer adopts a more stable conformation by crystal packing: the flexible Ctermini of two monomers are stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions between the amino acids in the Ala488-Thr492 (b4) and Ser450-Met452 (b3) loops, which form stable anti-parallel bsheets at the bottom of the dimer, resulting in clear electron density from residues Ser489-Leu495.",

The parallel N-termini of the two monomers are much more convenient for the binding of nsp4C to the membrane as a dimer, but this conformation is formed by mutagenesis and it could also be identified in the crystal packing of WT nsp4C (Fig.3D) .

Both molecules in one asymmetric unit of the WT nsp4C dimer and mutant C425S are shown in three orientations. Fig. 3A and 3B represents molecule A and molecule B of the WT nsp4C dimer respectively; while Fig. 3C represents the monomer of the C425S mutant. Fig. 3D represents the superposition of molecule A (gold) and B (magenta) from WT and the monomer of the C425S mutant (green), Cys425 is shown in stick representation, with the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms colored yellow, blue, red, and green, respectively; and also the crystal packing of WT nsp4C (magenta), symmetry-related molecules are colored in green, and the molecule forming the equivalent of the C425S mutant dimer is colored in blue. Selected amino acids are labeled, and the figure is drawn by PyMol [47] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006217.g003 Residues highlighted in red are identical among the compared proteins; residues highlighted in yellow are conserved.

The cytosol has long been regarded as a reducing cellular compartment in which the reduced state of cysteine in proteins is largely favored; the disulfide bond is generally formed in the more oxidizing ER lumen rather than the reducing cytosol [35, 36] . Furthermore, our results confirm that the nsp4C dimer can readily switch to a monomer in a reducing environment, so it is evident that nsp4C may exist as monomer in the reducing environment of the cytosol when it is expressed alone in uninfected cells. Our crystal structure further revealed that the N-termini of the two monomers in the WT nsp4C dimer are not suitably aligned to bind to the ER membrane. And also the dimer is formed in a non-reducing and highly condensed protein solution, and is therefore not representative of the physiological state. Moreover, from the multiple sequence alignment in Fig. 4B , the Cys425 is not a conserved amino acids among the coronavirus nsp4 proteins, thus the dimer is a specific case to MHV nsp4C. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser prevents formation of the disulfide bond, which does not influence the conformation of monomer, so the conformation of monomer is stable and conserved. Thus, the monomer of nsp4C may be physiologically functional when it is bound to the ER membrane in the cytosol.",

The poliovirus (PV) membrane proteins 2BC and 2C are also dispensable for viral RNA replication, but are exclusively associated with the formation of PV replication vesicles; 2BC recruits the COPII complex to the ER membranes to trigger vesicle formation [37, 38] . Furthermore, topology study revealed that the N-terminal may serve as signal peptide, and that the hydrophilic region between the first and second transmembrane domain is exposed to the ER lumen and is glycosylated in the ER [25] . Other hydrophilic regions of nsp4 are too short to interact with other proteins, and nsp4C was detected on the double membrane vesicles from SARS-CoV infected cells [34] , thus the cytosol exposed C-terminal of nsp4 should be involved in interactions with other viral or host cell proteins in replication.",

In the WT nsp4C structure, the Ser450-Met452 and Ala488-Thr492 loops are the most flexible regions of the molecule, but form more stable elements b3 and b4 respectively in the C425S mutant via interactions with adjacent molecules in the asymmetric unit, suggesting that interaction of these regions with other partner molecules could help to stabilize the nsp4C molecule. SARS coronavirus nsp2 reportedly interacts with nsp4 and nsp6 in vitro [39] . However, our Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based interaction assays of nsp4C with several MHV A59 nsps did not indicate any direct interaction between nsp4C and other nsps (data not shown). Since not all of the MHV ORF-encoded proteins were tested, further interaction studies are required to identify the nsp4C partner protein.",

In particular, the C-terminal hydrophilic region from T408 to Q496 is highly conserved among all the coronaviruses (Fig. 4B) , indicating that nsp4C may play a similar and conserved role in coronavirus replication. In summary, the crystal structure of MHV-A59 nsp4C reported here provides a preliminary structural description of coronavirus non-structural protein nsp4, further functional and structural studies of nsp4, together with its interaction with other virus and host cell proteins, will certainly boost our understanding the role of nsp4 in coronavirus replication.",

The recombinant glutathione transferase (GST) fusion protein, GST2nsp4C, was purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography. The cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The soluble fraction was then applied on a GSTaffinity chromatography column for purification. The GST tag was removed by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare), leading to five additional residues (GPLGS) at the N-terminus. The protein sample purified by affinity chromatography was further purified by anion ion-exchange chromatography on a ResourceQ column with an elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5 and a gradient concentration of NaCl to 1 M. The flow through fraction from Resource Q column was collected for gel filtration purification on a Superdex75 column in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.5 and 150 mM NaCl. A C425S site-directed mutant was constructed by overlapping extension PCR [40] , and was then expressed, and purified using the same protocol.",
