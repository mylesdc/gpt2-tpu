Based on the reference standard process described in the 'Methods' section, patients were assigned to four different diagnosis groups: (i) bacterial; (ii) viral; (iii) no apparent infectious disease or healthy (controls); and (iv) indeterminate. Patients diagnosed by the panel as having mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) were labeled as bacterial because they are managed similarly (e.g. treated with antibiotics) (see 'Methods', Fig. 1A ). In total, 89% of all enrolled patients were assigned a diagnosis, a rate which approaches the literature-documented limit [1-3]. The following sections provide a detailed description of patient characteristics, which includes all the patients with a final diagnosis (n=794): 765 patients included in the study cohort and 29 patients for which the serum samples were depleted during the screening phase (Fig. 1).
