In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span.",

The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions.",

A large number of their binding targets are of clinical significance, including bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, and certain Klebsiela pneumonia strains, as well as virus, such as HIV-1, HIV-2, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus(HCV), Dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus [2] [3] [4] [5] . One difference between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR is that DC-SIGN is expressed primarily on phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas DC-SIGNR expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver, lymph nodes and placental capillaries [6, 7] .",

The neck region connects the CRD from the transmembrane region and assembles the lectin into a tetrameric protein conformation on the cell surface. Thus the neck region is responsible for the homo-oligomerization that brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding [9] . On the other hand, heterozygous expression of DC-SIGNR of different length in the neck region may lead to reduced ligand-binding affinity and loss of the efficient recognition of multivalent ligands [8, 10] . Furthermore, the length variations of this neck region can critically influence the pathogen-binding properties of the CRD of these proteins, as some studies have found associations between length variation of the neck region and susceptibility to various infectious diseases, such as HIV, HCV, and SARS [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , though conflicting results were also found [18] . These infectious diseases affect an individual's life span, since they can be life-threatening and may lead to early death if lacking effective treatments. This is one of the mechanisms for natural selection in a population.",

The homozygote proportion, genotype and allele frequencies of the VNTR were listed in Table 1 . A length variation ranged from 5 repeats to 9 repeats in this VNTR locus were observed in our samples, and these different repeats (alleles) form 11 genotype. The most common genotype in our population is 7/7 (homozygote for the allele of 7repeats), followed by 5/7 and 7/9. The allele 7 has the highest frequency of 66.6%, followed by allele 5 of 15.5%, allele 9 of 14.15% and allele 6 of 3.62%. The allele 8 was fairly rare in Han Chinese population with a frequency of only 0.13%. The genotype frequencies of pericentenarian and control population did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05, by both chisquare and a Markov chain method in GENEPOP). Our results indicated that there was no significant difference in the homozygote proportion, genotype distribution and allele frequencies between the two groups. While, as we know, animals from a broad variety of taxa show sex differences in lifespan, for example, in mammals and insects, females commonly live longer than males [22, 23] , but males outlive females in most bird taxa [24] . To investigate whether there is a potential difference in our samples introduced by gender, we further divided the two groups into four: female peri-centenarian, male peri-centenarian, female control and male control. All groups also followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The result indicated that there was more 6/7 genotype in female peri-centenarian group than that in control group (Table 2 ) with a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041), but this difference was no longer significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It seems that the 6/7 genotype may show a false positive association due to multiple testing. However, we cannot exclude a functional role of 6/7 genotype and the hypothesis that the effect of DC-SIGNR on longevity maybe different between males and females.",

Mitchell et al. estimated a 25% heritability for the life-span in an Amish population in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania [25] , which implied a relatively strong genetic impact on human life-span. However, many genetic factors and signaling pathways involved in ageing process are still unknown [26, 27] . Here we hypothesized that genes which control immune response to infectious disease are likely related with longevity, but immune-related genes usually present a very high polymorphism and thus are prone to be confounded by population stratification in regular case-control studies [28] . For example, our former study suggested that a previously unrecognized population stratification, which was a geographic difference in genotype proportions and allele frequencies of the neck region of DC-SIGNR, existed in the Chinese of different geographic areas [18] . However, in the present study, our peri-centenarian and control groups came from the same community, and were ethnically matched, thus the spurious association caused by population stratification could be ruled out. Furthermore, all participants shared the same living environment and common diet habits, thus non-genetic factors were averted to the greatest extent.",

Although there were reports suggesting a balanced selection could sharpen the alleles frequencies of this locus [30] , the absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population may be caused by various reasons. First, most of the peri-centenarian individuals in this study had lower chance to get infectious diseases, as they were collected from Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, a relative isolated and remote region, i.e. the selection pressure on this locus was relaxed. For example, the sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003 was extensive in China but did not spread to this region [31, 32] . Furthermore, the HIV-1 case was rare in the region we studied. In this case, many infectious diseases could not exert selective pressure on such population. This may be one explanation as to why we could not find an association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity.",
