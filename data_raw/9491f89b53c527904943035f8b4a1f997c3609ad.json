Vitamin D concentrations were found to be higher among both DF and DHF cases as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.005 and P < 0.001). Vitamin D concentrations were not different between DF and DHF cases. When the dengue cases were classified into primary and secondary infections, secondary DHF cases had significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D as compared to secondary DF cases (P < 0.050). MBL concentrations were not significantly different between healthy controls and dengue cases. MBL concentrations were observed to be lower in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P < 0.050). Although MBL levels were not different DF and DHF cases based on immune status, the percentage of primary DHF cases (50%) having MBL levels lower than 500 ng/ml were less compared to primary DF cases (P = 0.038). Conclusions: The present study suggests that higher concentrations of vitamin D might be associated with secondary DHF while deficiency of MBL may be associated with primary DHF.",

Further analysis revealed that the association was more evident in secondary DHF. It has been shown that vitamin D induces expression of dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non integrin (DC-SIGN), the primary receptor for DENV entry into immature dendritic cells [19] . It has also been shown that calcitriol (active form of vitamin D) increases the expression of Fc\u03b3 receptors on human monocytic cell lines and monocyte derived dendritic cells [20, 21] . The increased concentrations of vitamin D, in DENV infected cases with secondary infection, might enhance viral entry through increased expression of Fc\u03b3 receptors leading to higher viral load, uncontrolled inflammatory responses and subsequent development of DHF. Vitamin D is also known to suppress Th1 cytokines and enhance IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to microbial antigens [14] [15] [16] . Since IL-10 is known to play a role in dengue disease pathogenesis [11] , it is possible that vitamin D could also contribute to disease pathogenesis through altered IL-10 response. Since the effect of vitamin D is also dependent on single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VDR gene [29] , the influence of vitamin D on dengue in the context of host genetics needs to be investigated.",

Interaction between complement components and non structural protein 1 (NS1) of flaviviruses has been reported to inhibit classical and lectin pathways of complement activation [33] . The present study revealed significantly lower levels of MBL in DHF cases suggesting that reduced activation of MBL mediated complement pathway might be associated with DHF. MBL is known to interact with N-linked glycans of structural proteins of DENV and neutralize the virus by blocking viral fusion. In experimentally infected mice, MBL dependent intravascular clearance of DENV has also been reported [24] . Therefore, it is possible that MBL deficiency might have led to decreased activation of MBL mediated pathway of complement and reduced intravascular clearance of DENV leading to higher viral load. Higher viral load has been shown to be associated with DHF in several studies [34, 35] .",

The association of MBL deficiency with DHF in primary infection also suggests that the protective effects of MBL and the innate immune responses are more important during primary infection which could be overshadowed by presence of cross reactive complement fixing antibodies during secondary infection [36] . In contrast to the present study, a study from Brazil has reported higher concentrations of MBL among DHF cases [7] . A higher MBL concentration might also lead to increased inflammation through enhancement of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased concentration of factor D and decreased concentration of factor H have been reported in DHF cases suggesting that imbalance in the regulation of factors H and D of the alternative pathway of complement activation is associated with DHF [26] . Since MBL concentrations are dependent on the presence of mutations in the structural and promoter regions of MBL2 gene, it is possible that variant alleles of MBL2 gene polymorphisms might be associated with DHF. A case control study from Brazil has shown the association of wild type alleles of the MBL2 gene with thrombocytopenia in dengue patients [25] . Further case control studies are needed to confirm the phenotypic effects of MBL2 gene polymorphisms in dengue patients with primary infection from India. Although, the present study is sufficiently powered to detect intermediate to large effect size, with regard to MBL, the study is underpowered and further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the preliminary associations.",

Clinical presentations of the patients recorded by the clinicians were used to classify the patients. The patients were classified into those with DF and those with DHF. Patients with fever, headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, and rash were defined as DF. DHF patients were categorized by the presence of at least two of the DHF defining criteria of the WHO [27] : hemorrhagic tendencies/manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of plasma leakage. Samples from 20 apparently healthy blood donors were also used in the study. This study was approved by the National Institute of Virology Human Ethics Committee.
