In only a few cases have the human receptors of pathogenic adhesins been described. A novel strategy-based on the construction of a lectin-glycan interaction (LGI) network-to identify the potential human binding receptors for pathogenic adhesins with lectin activity was developed. The new approach is based on linking glycan array screening results of these adhesins to a human glycoprotein database via the construction of an LGI network. This strategy was used to detect human receptors for virulent Escherichia coli (FimH adhesin), and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans (Als1p and Als3p adhesins) and C. glabrata (Epa1, Epa6, and Epa7 adhesins), which cause candidiasis. This LGI network strategy allows the profiling of potential adhesin binding receptors in the host with prioritization, based on experimental binding data, of the most relevant interactions. New potential targets for the selected adhesins were predicted and experimentally confirmed. This methodology was also used to predict lectin interactions with envelope glycoproteins of human-pathogenic viruses. It was shown that this strategy was successful in revealing that the FimH adhesin has anti-HIV activity.",

            "text": "Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the adhesion of Candida yeast species to host cells. Candida albicans and C. glabrata are commensal yeasts of the human gastrointestinal tract, but they are also the major causes of opportunistic Candida infections in susceptible hosts (14, 15) . The Als (agglutinin-like sequence) family is the best-characterized adhesin family of C. albicans (16) . The binding of Als proteins to human epithelial tissues has been attributed to the N-terminal part of the protein, which contains tandem immunoglobulin-like domains that are able to adhere to host proteins (17, 18) . Among the best-studied Als proteins are Als1p and Als3p, both of which are responsible for the mediation of cellular adhesion to a broad range of ligands, such as fibronectin (FN), laminin, and collagen IV, as well as fibrinogen and gelatin (18) (19) (20) (21) . Recently, we showed that N-Als1p has a lectin-like activity, since it interacts with fucose-containing carbohydrates (22) . Despite the vast amount of information available on Als-mediated adhesion, there is still little data available on the Als molecular binding mechanisms mediated by host carbohydrates. Another prominent yeast adhesin family is the Epa (epithelial adhesin) family, since it has been reported to be mainly responsible for the adherence of C. glabrata to human cells (23) (24) (25) . The N-terminal domains of Epa proteins (N-Epa-p) do not share sequence homology with the adhesins of the Als family, which are not present in C. glabrata. Rather, N-Epa proteins are classified as PA14-like lectins (26) (27) (28) because of their sequence homology and structural similarity to the PA14 fragment of the anthrax toxin protective antigen. They mediate adherence to human epithelial and endothelial cells by recognizing glycans containing terminal galactose residues (25) and show the highest affinity for the Thomsen-Friedenreich (T or TF) antigen (Gal\u2424-1,3-GalNAc), which likely mediates N-Epa-p adherence to highly glycosylated proteins such as mucins (28) . Although we recently demonstrated that wild-type N-Epa1p binds to FN from human plasma (29) , no experimental data on the potential host glycoprotein binding receptors of Epa1p or other C. glabrata adhesins are available.",

A strong feature of lectin CBAs as potential antiviral drugs is their multifarious mechanism of action. They can inhibit viral replication and cell-cell transmission of viral particles and induce partial deletion of the envelope glycan shield, with consequent exposure of immunogenic epitopes to neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, these antiviral compounds do not need to be internalized by host cells to be effective against the virus (32) . Various mannose-specific lectins endowed with potent antiretroviral activity have been discovered. They have been isolated from cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, algae, higher plants, and worms (34) (35) (36) . Antiviral activity of lectin CBAs against viruses other than HIV with high-mannose glycosylated envelope proteins, such as influenza virus, herpesvirus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Marburg virus (MARV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, measles virus, and Ebola virus, has been discovered (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) .",

            "text": "In this report, we present a novel glycan array-based network strategy aimed at identifying the potential biological binding receptors for adhesin lectins. First, the glycan determinants of the lectins are determined from the experimentally evaluated glycanbinding specificities of the lectins by glycan array analysis. Next, the GlycoSuiteDB glycoproteomic database of the UniCarbKB platform (46, 47) is searched for these determinants to obtain a set of human glycoproteins expressing the glycan determinants that are of interest and are considered potential targets for lectin recognition. By performing additional queries of the GlycoSuiteDB database, these potential target glycoproteins can be further linked to the cell types on which they are present, the tissues and body systems, and the disease state (if applicable). Finally, the network is analyzed in order to profile the potential adhesin binding receptors in the host with prioritization, based on experimental binding data, of the most relevant interactions. New potential targets for the selected adhesins were predicted and experimentally confirmed. The constructed networks are referred to as lectin-glycan interaction (LGI) networks. We explored this strategy and constructed LGI networks for two classes of pathogenic microbial adhesins that are characterized by lectin-like properties, i.e., the bacterial UPEC adhesin FimH-LD, as well as the yeast C. albicans and C. glabrata adhesins (i.e., Als1p and Als3p and Epa1p, Epa6p, and Epa7p, respectively). The LGI networks constructed were corroborated by comparison with interaction data available in the literature, and some links in the networks were experimentally confirmed by quantitative lectin-glycan interaction analysis (by surface plasmon resonance [SPR] and atomic force microscopysingle-molecule force spectroscopy [AFM-SMFS]). This networking strategy was also used to predict lectin interactions with envelope glycoproteins of human-pathogenic viruses. It was successful in anticipating the molecular recognition of the HIV gp120 envelope protein by the bacterial adhesin FimH-LD, and it led to the discovery of the anti-HIV activity of FimH.",

An edge connecting the two nodes can represent biochemical interactions, as well as biological and/or hierarchical associations between the nodes. With each node, we associate a node relevance, and with each edge, we associate an edge relevance, which indicates the relevance of the interaction between the connected nodes. The proposed representation allows visualization of the network in multiple ways in order to (i) highlight a set of glycoproteins as promising receptor candidates that were obscured in the huge amount of data in the LGI network and (ii) predict the potential binding receptors for several lectins. In our specific case, the network involved a combination of both experimental data and the data from the publicly available Glyco-SuiteDB database. The binding specificity and strength of microbial lectins (FimH-LD, N-Als, and N-Epa) were experimentally determined by glycan array screening. The measured binding strengths were exported into a spreadsheet, whereas those glycan structures and determinants that are recognized by the adhesins were queried in the GlycoSuiteDB database. The query provided a list of hundreds of potential target proteins (cases of glycan deter-minants not attached to any protein were also taken into account), and they were further linked to cell types, tissues, body systems, and diseases (if available) through additional queries in the same database. The resultant nodes and edges/links (associations) provided the LGI network definition in its initial state, where all of the nodes and edges were considered equally relevant; a relevance quantification stage followed.",

            "text": "The relevance quantification process was achieved in two steps. We first associated each edge with a relevance depending on the type of its connecting nodes (i.e., protein-glycan) according to the proposed weights (see equations 1 to 3 in the supplemental material) as a function of the lectin binding intensity measured via glycan array screenings. In the second step, the node's relevance was estimated by using a network analysis centrality measure (48) that involves both the number of edges (associations) connected to the node and their weights (lectin binding intensity) (see the supplemental material). The influence of the number of edges (or associations) versus the binding intensity is regulated by the parameter (see the supplemental material for a discussion of its influence), and its value can be interactively adjusted during the visualizations to better study the different associations (see Fig. 2 and 5). Determination of the relevance values allowed us to rank or establish priorities among the potential targets, enabling a convenient visualization of the most important proteins (or disease, glycan, etc.) as the bigger nodes and the most important associations (i.e., protein-disease, disease-glycan) as thicker edges/links. In particular, three complementary visualization types were used, namely, hierarchical, circular, and cluster views (11) . This allowed an interactive analysis of the resultant network in great detail, highlighting the most relevant nodes in the overall network, as well as within specific clusters, at the same time (see the supplemental material). The hierarchical view (see Fig. 1 , 3, and 7) allowed linking of the experimentally determined lectin specificities (i.e., the glycan determinants) with the potential receptors (human or viral glycoproteins) and then linking of these glycoproteins to cell types/tissues and body systems. The circular view allowed easy identification of all of the relevant nodes according to their size, and the most important associations were made as the thickest arrows (see Fig. 1 and 4). The cluster view revealed cluster-like visualizations (49) , thus allowing us to explore groups of nodes belonging to the same local cluster (see Fig. 2 and 5). Some glow and shading effects can be (optionally) applied in order to distinguish between the groups of nodes according to their types within the same cluster (see Fig. 2A and B and 5A and B).",

The FimH LGI network ( Fig. 1 ) was generated by using FimH-LD experimental glycan array data that are perfectly consistent with the previously published microarray results (10) and reflect the high specificity of FimH-LD for high-mannose glycans, i.e., the oligomannose 3, oligomannose 5, mannotriose, and mannopentaose structures. A hierarchical view of the network shows the predicted receptors (human glycoproteins) for the FimH adhesin and their classification in terms of body tissues and systems (Fig. 1A) . A circular view of the same LGI network (Fig. 1B) focuses on the glycan determinants that are bound by FimH-LD, the potential glycoprotein ligands, and also lists the diseases correlated with the expression of the glycosylation determinants indicated. Only a few of the predicted glycoprotein binding receptors are associated with specific disease states (mainly malignancies), which is the case for several immunoglobulins (such as, IgE, IgM, and IgA), CG-a, CG-b, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and PSAP (see Table S2 in the supplemental material for a list with abbreviated protein names). Among these, immunoglobulin mu (IgM) and the EGFR are reported by the network to be particularly relevant, while TF is highlighted in the group of non-disease-associated glycoproteins. The latter are all linked to the determinants containing either Man\u2423-1,2-Man or Man\u2423-1,3-Man as terminal moieties. The network displays other human glycoproteins, such as UMOD, CD49e/CD29, C3, t-PA, and PLG, for which a link with FimH or type 1 fimbriae has already been established (see Discussion) and for which any defined relationship with the bacterial adhesin has not been found yet, for example, BACE1, vWF, and gamma interferon.",

The hierarchical view of the overall Epa/Als network (Fig. 3) is extended, since it is based on the glycan specificities of six adhesins. Mucins (several proteins containing the abbreviation MUC) appear as the most relevant human glycoproteins. In the circular view of the Epa network ( Fig. 4A) , mucins are mainly connected to the glycan determinants Gal\u2424-1,3-GalNAc, Gal\u2424-1,4-GlcNAc, and Gal\u2424-1,4-GlcNAc\u2424-1,6[Gal\u2424-1,3-]GalNAc. These three determinants, together with the sialyl-T antigen, are prioritized on the basis of the related lectin binding intensities, especially in the case of the Gal\u2424-1,3-containing moieties (large arrow width), and the number of connections, i.e., for Gal\u2424-1,4-GlcNAc, the largest node size in the network but unlabeled because of the low binding intensity (the label was filtered out in the program for better visualization of the more relevant nodes [see the supplemental material]).

The glycan determinants queried in the UniCarbKB database, the human glycoproteins bearing the glycan determinants, and the related diseases are depicted as blue, green, and red nodes, respectively. Connections between nodes are depicted with blue arrows (to indicate the determinants expressed on each glycoprotein) or green arrows (to indicate the diseases associated with the altered glycosylation of each glycoprotein). A closeup view of the network is shown on the left. The size of each node (and the font size of the node label) in the circular view is proportional to the number of connections with other nodes and the associated lectin binding intensity, which were experimentally determined by glycan array analysis; the arrow thickness is correlated to the lectin binding intensity.

            "text": "LGI network strategy developed pointed out a limited number of human glycoproteins, mainly situated in the urogenital and hemic systems of the human body, as the potential binding receptors for the FimH adhesin. Only a few of the predicted links have been experimentally confirmed in the literature, and these deliver the first proof of the validity of our strategy for the prediction of lectin binding receptors. Type 1 fimbriated E. coli is able to recognize Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, also known as uromodulin (UMOD) (51) . The binding to this protein was confirmed by the network strategy (Fig. 1) . UMOD is a urinary defense factor, since it can prevent the interaction of bacterial fimbriae with the uroplakin receptors through its single glycan chain. FimH is also involved in the invasion of uroepithelial cells because of its direct binding to highmannose glycans of integrins \u24241 and \u24233 (52). Other integrin subunits could also be involved in the entry of FimH-expressing bacteria into host cells (52) . One of these subunits could be the \u24235 integrin, which was also predicted in the network, together with the \u24241 integrin as a \u24235/\u24241 heterodimer (CD49e/CD29) (Fig. 1 ) that was already reported to mediate host cell invasion through the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (53) . Type 1 fimbriae also have a role in complement-dependent bacterial internalization (54) . Synergy between the expression of FimH on bacterial fimbriae and binding of the C3 complement protein increased E. coli internalization through epithelial cells of the urinary tract. This effect was abrogated by mannose or in the absence of the mannose-specific adhesin on the bacterial fimbriae. The same synergistic effect could not be correlated with the expression of P fimbriae, which would be carrying the PapG adhesin. These data and the presence of C3 in the FimH LGI network suggest that the glycosylated complement protein, scavenged by and directly associated with the FimH LDs, could facilitate bacterial entry into uroepithelial host cells. A genetically engineered Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that expresses type 1 fimbriae can specifically adhere to breast cancer cells overexpressing the EGFR and block the EGFR signaling pathway (55) . The effect of fimbriae on receptor signaling has been described as mannose sensitive. Indeed, the LGI network suggests the recognition by FimH-LD of the EGFR from carcinoma cells. We can thus hypothesize that FimH-LD may also mediate bacterial adhesion and have the same effect on growth factor receptor signaling. The FimH-LD LGI network displays several immunoglobulin families that are associated with different malignant diseases, including IgA from myeloma cells (Fig. 1) . Immunoglobulin preparations containing secretory IgA or IgA from myeloma cells can induce mannose-dependent agglutination of type 1 fimbria-expressing E. coli (56) . Weaker agglutination of these cells can also be achieved through certain IgM isotypes and prevented by the presence of D-mannose. Other connections are established in the network between the fimbrial adhesin and disease states affecting protein glycosylation. For example, a link with diabetes mellitus is corroborated by the observation that female patients with this disease are more susceptible to UTIs than are healthy patients because of the greater adherence of type 1 fimbriated E. coli to bladder cells (57) .",

            "text": "The LGI network of Candida Als and Epa adhesins N-Als1p has been shown to interact with fucose-containing glycans that are present in blood group antigens and preferentially with antigen H type 2 (22) . Therefore, we performed glycan array screening to also determine the carbohydrate-binding specificity of N-Als3p (see Fig. S2A to D in the supplemental material). Among the strongest binders, we found long chains of repeated LacNAc (Gal\u2424-1,4-GlcNAc), and a micromolar affinity was determined for the interaction of the adhesin with BSA-GlcNAc. GlcNAc constitutes of a part of the type 1 LacNAc (Gal\u2424-1,3-GlcNAc) and type 2 LacNAc (Gal\u2424-1,4-GlcNAc) structures that build the scaffold for blood group H and Lewis-type units (58) . Some human pathogens use the GlcNAc residue as a binding receptor; e.g., the fimbrial adhesin F17-G of enterotoxigenic E. coli binds to N-acetylglucosamine-presenting receptors on the microvilli of the intestinal epithelium of ruminants (59) . Our N-Als3p glycan array data, together with data related to N-Als1p and the Epa adhesins, were used for the generation of LGI networks (Fig. 3 to 5) . These networks revealed that a large set of potential binding receptors that may be recognized by these adhesins through their interaction with carbohydrates are displayed on human cells or present in body fluids. The most interesting ones are summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Several glycan determinants are linked to mucins ( Fig. 3 and 4) . Mucins are the main constituents of the extracellular secreted mucus and cell surface glycocalyx, which is rich in the GalNAc-containing structures commonly used by many pathogens for adhesion. C. albicans adhesion to human cells has been previously linked to mucins (60, 61) . The binding of Epa adhesins to mucin-type O-glycans has also been described, especially the ability of Epa1p, Epa6p, and Epa7p to recognize the T antigen (25, 27, 28) . This disaccharide constitutes of the core 1 structure of mucin-type O-glycans, and it is mainly exposed on the surface of colon cancer tissues in a truncated form. The T and sialyl-T antigens are also found on breast cancer cells (62) . The three Epa proteins are linked in the network to the mucins found in several tissues or fluids, such as saliva, lung tissue, stomach tissue, mammary gland tissue, milk, colon tissue, and uterine tissue. A consistent fraction of these mucins is associated with diseased states, i.e., colon adenocarcinoma (MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5A/B/C), breast and uterine cancers (MUC1), and lung diseases, which may cause bronchiectasis (MUC) (Fig. 5) . These mucins carry the T antigen, the sialyl-T antigen, or both. A link between Epa adhesins and the colon mucosa has been demonstrated by showing adhesion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing Epa1p and Epa6p to human colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2) cells (28) . A connection between the Epa proteins and CD43 (leukosialin)/CD45 (receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C) is also present in the LGI network (Fig. 4) , and this is justified by the presence of the T antigen that is linked to leukemia-and HIV-associated CD45 and to WAS-associated CD43, as well as other glycans related to a healthy condition. CD43 and CD45 receptors are commonly expressed on leukocytes (63) . They are involved in lymphocyte activation and may present altered glycosylation in HIV-infected cells (64) (65) (66) or in diseases such as leukemia and WAS. Lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins 1 and 2 (LAMP1, LAMP2), which are as well predicted, are expressed in macrophages and are essential for the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes during phagocytosis (67) . They may also present altered glycosylation in leukemia cells. Epa1p is able to mediate yeast adhesion to human leukemic macrophages and healthy PBMCs, in order to trigger cytokine expression and induce phagocytosis (68) . The inhibitory effect of phagocytosed C. glabrata on the fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes in macrophages is an efficient immune evasion strategy (69) . Possibly, Epa1p adhesion to human PBMCs is mediated by CD43/45. This is consistent with CD43/45-mediated adherence of Actinomyces naeslundii, expressing Gal\u2424-1,3-Gal(NAc)-specific adhesins, to polymorphonuclear leukocytes or promyelocytic leukemia cells (70) and the involvement of CD45 in the induction of cytokine production, as for the T-antigen-specific jacalin (plant lectin) that recognizes CD45 on T lymphocytes and induces cytokine secretion (71) .",

The link of N-Epa1p with FN is corroborated by our recent results (29) , which show that the adhesin domain is able to bind FN with submicromolar affinity in a carbohydrate-sensitive manner.

The first two are blood plasma glycoproteins, while the latter is present in different exocrine secretions. All of them are involved in iron metabolism. C. albicans is able to acquire iron from TF (72) . Thus, C. albicans iron acquisition from host TF may be Als mediated, as is iron acquisition from human ferritin (73) . Inhibitory effects of TF, IgM, and another components of Cohn fraction IV (most probably ceruloplasmin) on the growth of C. glabrata have been discussed (74) , as has the capacity of a special LTF formulation to impair yeast adherence to vaginal epithelial cells (75) . The EGFR and cadherin-5 (CD144) are also indicated in the network as potential ligands of both Als proteins (Fig. 4) . For the first glycoprotein, there is agreement with a study describing the EGFR and HER2 as interaction receptors for Als3p (76) . The interaction of Als3p with these receptors triggers their autophosphorylation, which leads to endocytosis of C. albicans by host cells. It has also been demonstrated previously that Als3p binds to N-and E-cadherins, which are present on endothelial and epithelial cells, respectively (77) . As shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material, additional reported experimental results confirmed some Als LGI network nodes, such as for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, -casein, and CG-a/b. FN, laminin, and mucin recognition by Candida adhesins. Using SPR, we characterized the interaction of N-Epa1p with mucin (Fig. 6B) . A comparable K D value was found for the N-Epa1p-FN interaction (29) . The specific binding inhibition by lactose corroborated the specificity of glycan recognition by N-Epa1p. These data confirmed, for the first time, the ability of N-Epa1p to bind mucins. As shown in the LGI network, adhesion of Epa adhesins to mucins is extremely relevant in the context of host adherence and is mediated by multiple O-glycan determinants.",

Also, the N-Als3p-laminin dissociation constant was higher than that previously determined for N-Als1p. The fulllength Als1 and Als3 adhesins showed significant binding to FN and laminin (18) . It seems that the interaction of Als proteins with FN is determined mainly by the protein-protein interactions. Indeed, fucose failed to inhibit N-Als1p binding to the glycoprotein, while glucose and galactose only partially inhibited it (22) . Additionally, we could not find a connection between Als adhesins and FN in the LGI network. Recently, it was shown that NT-Als9-2p recognizes the C-terminal sequence of the fibrinogen \u2425 peptide (78) . These results indicate that protein-protein interactions may dominate the binding of N-Alsp to FN.",

To predict interactions of FimH-LD with viral envelope glycoproteins, we generated a viral LGI network by employing FimH-LD glycan array data and the viral glycoproteomic data available in the Gly-cosuiteDB database. The network suggested the recognition of different viruses, including three human-pathogenic viruses (Fig. 7) .

Accordingly, the resulting equilibrium constants for the same interactions were much higher than the K D of the best-characterized lectins CVN and GRFT, but they are still in the nanomolar range. This affinity of FimH-LD for the viral envelope protein justifies the moderate in vitro antiviral activity of the lectin.

We developed and successfully employed a novel LGI network in which the carbohydrate-binding properties of the E. coli adhesin FimH and Candida adhesins from the Epa and Als adhesin families were explored. This LGI network strategy, based on glycan array screening results and a glycoprotein database inquiry, allowed the profiling of potential glycoprotein binding targets for the selected adhesins. We confirmed some of these potential targets either experimentally or by reference to the literature. Additionally, this strategy was adapted for the prediction of adhesin-viral glycoprotein interactions, validated by the discovery of anti-HIV activity of FimH. This study shows the potential of the new strategy for the study of some microbial and viral interactions.",

Experimental data could also be extracted from other databases (such as the Glycosciences Laboratory Database, Imperial College London). Care should be taken to check the quality of the extracted data. Although the Glycosuite database of UniCarbKB used is a curated glycoproteomic database, it has some limitations, since it is not exhaustive. We expect future improvements in the content of this database and, consequently, an enhancement of the LGI network's prediction quality and accuracy. The LGI network strategy could be connected to additional bioinformatic resources that could support the validation of the LGI network generated, for example, the SugarBind database (http://sugarbind.expasy.org), which provides information on known carbohydrate sequences to which pathogenic organisms or substances (bacteria, toxins, and viruses) specifically adhere to. The network strategy developed could also be easily extended to other lectin-glycan interactions, where-besides human or viral interactions-other mammalian, plant, or protozoan glycan interactions could be explored, and also used, for example, for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the strategy could be used to predict the binding of viral proteins to human glycoproteins or carbohydrate structures, with the aim to facilitate the design of novel antiviral drug compounds, especially in the case of emerging viral pathogens.",

The results were filtered by removing the data of three times the standard error of the mean (SEM) and using a signal-to-noise ratio cutoff value that was larger than the average number of relative fluorescence units (RFU). The signal-to-noise ratio cutoff value was visually selected on the glycan array screening graphs. The RFU values were normalized by dividing the values by the maximal RFU value of the screening. The mean RFU value was used when more than one value was detected in different screenings for the same glycan interaction. Glycanbinding protein binding sites may accommodate glycan determinants made up of two to six linear monosaccharides together with their potential side chains containing other sugars and modifications (4) . Therefore, glycan determinant structures containing oligosaccharides composed of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbohydrate residues present at the nonreducing end were submitted to the GlycoSuiteDB database in the UniCarbKB platform (46, 47) .",

Glycan determinant data and their connections with human glycoproteins and related diseases are depicted for C. glabrata N-Epa-p (A), and C. albicans N-Als-p (B). Closeup views of the networks are shown on the right. The nodes dimensions and arrow thickness/label size depend on the number of connections, and the glycan-binding strength, respectively (see the legend toFig. 1). Notably, the determinants Gal(\u24241-4)GlcNAc (A) and Fuc(\u24231-2)Gal (B) are both characterized by a high number of connections (large node, i.e., several human glycoproteins are characterized by the presence of these glycan determinant) but a low relevance. No label is shown; i.e., the Epa/Als intensities of binding to the glycans that contains these determinants are lower than the other determinants. The program filters out the node labels on the basis of the lectin binding intensity and displays only the labels of the most relevant glycan determinants (see the supplemental material).cell assays(Fig. 8B). The lectin activity (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ]) against X4 HIV-1 NL4.3 was 54.5 g/ml in the MT-4 cell line, as evaluated by the induction of a CPE and subsequently by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-phenazine ethosulfate (PES) method. In addition, when the protein was evaluated against X4 HIV-1 NL4.3 and R5 HIV-1 BaL replication (measured by P-24 HIV-1 antigen [Ag] enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; obtained from healthy donors), the EC 50 s obtained were 34.3 \u03ee 6.1 (n \u03ed 8) and 74.5 \u03ee 19.2 (n \u03ed 6) g/ml, respectively. These anti-HIV-1 data show a consistent anti-HIV-1 activity profile, although the FIG 5 Cluster views of the global Als/Epa LGI network. This representation is focused on the human glycoproteins, tissues, systems, and diseases associated with the glycan determinants recognized by the Als/Epa adhesins. Tissue and disease clusters are highlighted in panels A and B, respectively. The tissue clusters are represented with a pink glow (A), the protein clusters are shown with a green glow (B), and the disease clusters are shown with a red glow (B). The most relevant elements of the four main network clusters are shown in detail as closeup views of panel B (four lower subpanels). In panel A, the nodes related to the tissues are important, since they are the most connected ones (the larger the number of connections, the larger the node and font size). In panel B, the disease and protein nodes are most important, since the node (and font) sizes are proportional to the lectin binding intensities, and they are the most connected ones. The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the associated lectin binding intensity.peptide was somewhat less active (~2-fold) against R5 HIV-1 replication. The 50% cytotoxic concentration was \u03fe500 g/ml, and there was no cytotoxicity observed at all at 500 g/ml in MT-4 cells and in PBMC, which provided a selectivity index of at least \u03fe10 for X4 HIV-1. As a control, broadly neutralizing anti-gp120 carbohydrate monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2G12 was included in these experiments. When evaluated in the same PBMC HIV replication assay in our experiments, it showed EC 50 s of 0.14 g/ml for HIV-1 NL4.3 and 3.71 g/ml for HIV-1 BaL. So, the slight decrease in anti-HIV activity of FimH-LD against R5 HIV-1 BaL is FIG 6 Binding characterization of N-Als3p and N-Epa1p.

The antiviral activity of FimH-LD was also assessed with the TZM-bl-HIV-1 luminescence assay. The infectivity of the TZM-bl cell line with X4 HIV-1 NL4.3 was inhibited with an IC 50 of 54.3 g/ml, while the inhibition of R5 HIV-1 BaL infectivity generated an EC 50 of 162 g/ml.
