All women had a clinically indicated amniocentesis to rule out intra-amniotic infection. A proteomic fingerprint (MR score) was generated from fresh samples of amniotic fluid using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Presence or absence of the biomarkers of the MR score was interpreted in relationship to the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval, placental inflammation, and early-onset neonatal sepsis for all neonates admitted to the Newborn Special Care Unit (n \u00bc 104). Women with ''severe'' amniotic fluid inflammation (MR score of 3 or 4) had shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery intervals than women with ''no'' (MR score of 0) inflammation or even ''minimal'' (MR score of 1 or 2) inflammation (median [ Nonetheless, a ''minimal'' degree of inflammation was also associated with preterm birth regardless of membrane status. There was a significant association between the MR score and severity of histological chorioamnionitis (r \u00bc 0.599, p , 0.001). Furthermore, neonatal hematological indices and early-onset sepsis significantly correlated with the MR score even after adjusting for gestational age at birth (OR for MR 3-4: 3.3 [95% CI, 1.1 to 9.2], p \u00bc 0.03). When compared with other laboratory tests routinely used to diagnose amniotic fluid inflammation and infection, the MR score had the highest accuracy to detect inflammation (white blood cell count . 100 cells/mm 3 ), whereas the combination of Gram stain and MR score was best for rapid prediction of intra-amniotic infection (positive amniotic fluid culture).",

The MR score ranges from 0 to 4, depending upon the presence or absence of each of the four protein biomarkers [14] .

However, in the current investigation, we also stratified the study population based on the ''severity'' of inflammation (MR \u00bc 0 indicates ''no'' inflammation; MR \u00bc 1-2 indicates ''minimal'' inflammation; and MR \u00bc 3-4 indicates ''severe'' inflammation). One investigator (author IAB) performed all the protein chip array readings and scored all the samples ''blindly,'' being unaware of either clinical presentation or outcome. The MR score results were not used for clinical management.

Three histological stages of chorioamnionitis [23] (stage I: intervillositis, stage II: chorionic inflammation, and stage III: full thickness inflammation of both chorion and amnion) were complemented by the histological grading system devised by Salafia et al. which includes four grades of inflammation of the amnion, chorion-decidua, and umbilical cord [24] .",

All neonates under-went clinical and laboratory evaluations of sepsis. Clinical indications for early-onset neonatal sepsis included lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, and shock. Earlyonset neonatal sepsis was defined as the presence of confirmed or suspected sepsis at less than 3 d after birth. Confirmed sepsis was established when either the blood and/ or cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive. Suspected sepsis was diagnosed in the presence of clinical suspicion of sepsis with support from other laboratory results. Early-onset neonatal sepsis was dichotomized into present (when sepsis was either confirmed or suspected) or absent, and coefficients of associations with other binary variables were calculated. Laboratory criteria were based on modification of the criteria of Rodwell et al. [25] when two or more of the following were observed: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 7,500/ml or greater than 14,500/ml, absolute band count (ABC) greater than 1,500/ml, immature/total neutrophil ratio (I:T ratio) geater than 0.16, platelet count less than 150,000 cells/mm 3 , or an abnormal spinal tap [26] .

To avoid introducing spectrum bias [27] , no patient or AF sample was excluded from the final analysis; a search for intra-amniotic inflammation/infection was made in each sample and a clinical decision taken independently following review of the laboratory results for each amniocentesis procedure. Test accuracy (cases correctly classified divided by total number of cases), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were measured for each assay by examining the distribution of individual AF tests on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. Because amniocenteses were performed across a wide range of gestation periods, the times from the amniocentesis to birth for the 169 patients were normalized to reflect pregnancy prolongation after amniocentesis as previously described [28] . The percent prolongation of pregnancy was calculated by dividing the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval by the number of days gestation at amniocentesis times 100. Kaplan-Meier probability plots were generated based on the duration from amniocentesis to delivery and their differences tested with the log-rank test (GraphPad Software, http://www. graphpad.com). Continuous data were compared with the Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls tests (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis on ranks followed by the Dunn tests (nonparametric) to adjust for multiple comparisons as appropriate. Comparisons between proportions were done with the Chi-square test or Chi-square test for trend (MedCalc). Twoby-two contingency tables were constructed and Chi-square analysis of independence was used to identify significant differences among test performances. The phi-coefficient of correlation (U), an index of association for binary data, was also calculated [29] . Variables (glucose, LDH, gram stain, IL-6, and MMP-8) were dichotomized based on the defined clinical thresholds. Multiple stepwise linear and logistic regression analyses were used to adjust p-values and odds ratios (ORs), respectively, for potential influences of gestational age or other parameters. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to indicate significance.",

An MR score of 3-4 had the strongest association with inflammation (Chi-square \u00bc 105.3, U \u00bc 0.822, p , 0.001), followed by LDH (Chi-square \u00bc 71.5, U \u00bc 0.754, p , 0.001). The MR score was originally designed to predict intraamniotic inflammation (WBC . 100 cells/mm 3 ) [14] , but not to determine the number of WBCs that must be present for the MR score to change from a negative to a positive score. Using ROC analysis, we now find that a WBC cutoff of greater than 38 cells/mm 3 predicts an MR score of 3-4. Thus, the MR score is actually more precise for the identification of intraamniotic inflammation compared to the recommended WBC cutoffs. [16] . We next tested the utility of each test to predict a positive AF culture result ( Table 6 ). The Gram stain had the highest specificity and accuracy for prediction of a positive AF culture.

Contrary to our initial investigation, we found that the interpretation of the MR score in the real world is not binary (''disease present'' or ''disease absent''), rather it is a gradient progressing from the absence of disease to ''minimal'' and then to ''severe'' inflammation. We demonstrated that the WBC count (one of the tests used for diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation) fails to effectively separate groups by their risk of preterm birth until the WBC level is very high. One does not need to be an obstetrician to understand how difficult it is in our current practice to interpret the results of the clinical tests routinely ordered to rule out infection and inflammation. Not only are the results often discordant, but their subjective interpretation based on previously reported diagnostic cutoffs for intra-amniotic inflammation frequently leads to iatrogenic preterm delivery in the absence of relevant confirmatory information [20] . Our concordance analysis clearly demonstrates the superiority and ease of interpretation of the MR score in comparison with any other clinical test judged alone or as a group. Proteomic profiling alone was able to correctly confirm or exclude inflammation in over 90% of our samples, whereas the other five tests taken together performed much less accurately. For clinical relevance, we compared the diagnostic performance of the MR score against glucose, WBC count, LDH, IL-6, and MMP-8 by using the clinical laboratory cutoffs previously reported in the literature [18, 19, 21, 22] . Due to the retrospective nature of most of the previous reports, further studies need to be done to reevaluate prospectively the cutoffs currently used by the clinicians to best diagnose intra-amniotic inflammation and infection, histological chorioamnionitis, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. Furthermore, such new cutoffs should be compared in a prospective fashion against the MR score.",

We found that the components of a given MR score are not random, but recurrent and sequential. The current results suggest that the initial phase of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response is characterized by the appearance of defensins. Recognizing that the neutrophil count does not necessarily reflect functional responsiveness [34] and that neutrophil activation is a complex sequential event, it is reasonable to suggest that the generation of a proteomic fingerprint like the MR score provides a unique tool to monitor the degree of activation. The median WBC count for the group of women with ''minimal'' inflammation (an MR score of 1 or 2) was extremely low (six cells/mm 3 ). Currently, no clinical intervention can be recommended based on such a low WBC count. This argues for the clinical utility of performing proteomic analysis and not an AF WBC count. In addition, the results of our study seem to suggest that the MR score (one to two biomarkers present) can identify women at risk of premature delivery, when no clinical test other than proteomic profiling can do it. Thus, it is critical that at this stage, in women with ''minimal'' inflammation, we initiate as soon as possible prospective randomized trials to determine whether drugs with well-recognized anti-inflammatory properties (i.e., N-acetylcysteine) can halt the progress of diseases and prolong pregnancy [8] . Furthermore, several women with ''severe'' inflammation (an MR score 3-4) showed a full inflammatory response even when WBC counts were well below the currently recommended cutoffs for inflammation. This observation suggests that the concept of maternal and fetal inflammation needs revision, because the degree of neutrophil activation as reflected by the MR score may be more clinically relevant than the absolute WBC count.",

A preterm delivery, or premature birth, is normally defined as one that occurs before 37 weeks after the last menstrual cycle (an average pregnancy lasts around 40 weeks). Premature birth is fairly common, with around 12% of births in the US fitting this definition. However, it has serious consequences, being responsible for around 70% of infant deaths and other adverse outcomes for the baby. It is not clear in all cases what directly causes premature birth or how to identify cases in which mother and child are at greater risk of serious outcomes. Evidence from case-control and other studies strongly suggests that infections of the uterus, placenta, or genital tract are associated with, and are likely to directly cause, premature deliveries. Such infections, even if they are ''subclinical'' (that is, they do not directly cause signs or symptoms that the doctor or patient would notice) cause inflammation in the affected tissues. Hence, it's possible that particular proteins or other molecules could provide a ''signature'' that would allow the inflammation to be picked up at an early stage.",

If inflammation could be picked up early, this might help identify mothers at risk of having a preterm delivery, and even to pinpoint cases of very severe inflammation where the baby is more at risk of poor outcomes. The researchers involved in this study had already done previous work looking at protein profiles in the amniotic fluid (the liquid directly surrounding the developing fetus). They identified a set of four protein ''markers'' that were closely associated with inflammation in the amniotic fluid, and developed a score based on those proteins, which they termed the ''Mass Restricted'' (MR) score. The researchers showed that this score could accurately identify women at risk of preterm delivery. However, before using the protein marker score in clinical practice it is very important to really be sure it is a reliable diagnostic test for preterm birth and adverse outcomes resulting from preterm birth. Therefore the researchers wanted to find out whether MR scores were associated with the outcome of pregnancy; the presence of infection in the placenta, as detected through microscopic analysis of tissue; and sepsis (severe infection) in the newborn baby.",

In all cases the decisions about how to manage the pregnancy (for example, whether to deliver the baby or attempt to delay birth) were made by the woman and her physician, not by any procedures laid out in the research study. A total of 169 women were recruited into the study and had a sample of amniotic fluid taken as part of their routine clinical management. The researchers then analyzed this fluid to calculate the protein MR score, to look for evidence of bacterial infection, and also carried out standard laboratory tests. After childbirth the placenta was examined under the microscope to look for any evidence of inflammation. Finally, all babies were checked for any evidence of sepsis. The researchers found that, in line with findings from their previous studies, women with a higher MR score gave birth sooner. There also seemed to be a close agreement between the MR score and evidence of inflammation in the placenta, once it was analyzed under the microscope after birth. Furthermore, mothers with a high MR score were more likely to give birth to babies with suspected or confirmed sepsis. The researchers then compared the usefulness of the MR score against other potential tests for inflammation. Of all the tests compared, the MR score seemed to be the most accurate in predicting inflammation.",

Five microliters of diluted AF (1:10) was placed in duplicate on spots of H4 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, California, United States) and incubated for 1 h. After 1 h, the AF samples were aspirated, and the spots were individually washed three times with 25% acetonitrile solution, air dried, and then overlaid with matrix solution (1 ll of 20% saturated solution of a-cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid [CHCA] on one array and two overlays of 1 ll of 50% saturated solution of sinnapinic acid [SPA] on the other array). The chips were air dried and then read in a Protein Biology System IIC (PBS IIC) SELDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Ciphergen Biosystems) using the ProteinChip software v3.1.1. The CHCA chip allows for the identification of defensins 2 (P1: 3,377.01 Da) and 1 (P2: 3,448.09 Da).
