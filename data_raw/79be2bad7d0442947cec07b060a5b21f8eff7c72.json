            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a recognized progressive neurodegenerative disorder which is caused by a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra (1, 2) . Although the etiology of the disease remains unknown, postmortem studies have indicated that dying cells not only bear signs of necrosis, but also of apoptosis, in particular chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation (3, 4) . 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP + ) is commonly used in vitro and in vivo to produce models of PD (5, 6) . Similar to other dopaminergic toxins, MPP + causes oxidative stress and the selective death of dopaminerigic neuronal cells, such as PC12 (7) and SH-SY5Y cells (8) .",

Our data revealed that GA attenuated MPP + -induced cell death, the high apoptotic rate, the intracellular Ca 2+ overload, the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Further experiments indicated that the activation of ERK contributes to the GA-mediated neuroprotection of dopaminergic neuronal cells. (19) .

The present study clearly confirms that GA exerts marked neuroprotective effects, as evidenced by our results: GA greatly ameliorated the MPP + -induced reduction in cell viability, the increased apoptotic rate, the intracellular Ca 2+ overload and the dissipation in MMP in the DPC12 cells. GA also exerted suppressive effects on the overproduction of intracellular LDH caused by MPP + . Consistent with the results of previous studies (25, 26) , this suppressive effect on the LDH level is a consequence of the protective effects of GA against neurotoxicity. PARP is a family of proteins involved in a number of cellular processes, including DNA repair and programmed cell death (27) .
