            "text": "Failure to incorporate the beliefs and attitudes of the public into theoretical models of preparedness has been identified as a weakness in strategies to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks. We administered a cross-sectional telephone survey to a representative sample (n = 443) of the Swedish adult population to examine whether self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks could be explained by trust in official information, self-reported health (SF-8), sociodemographic factors, and determinants postulated in protection motivation theory, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The interviewees were asked to make their appraisals for two scenarios: a) an influenza with low case fatality and mild lifestyle impact; b) severe influenza with high case fatality and serious disturbances of societal functions. Every second respondent (50.0%) reported high trust in official information about influenza. The proportion that reported intentions to take deliberate actions to improve personal hygiene during outbreaks ranged between 45-85%, while less than 25% said that they intended to increase social distancing. Multiple logistic regression models with coping appraisal as the explanatory factor most frequently contributing to the explanation of the variance in intentions showed strong discriminatory performance for staying home while not ill (mild outbreaks: Area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.82;0.89), severe outbreaks AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77;0.85)) and acceptable performance with regard to avoiding public transportation (AUC 0.78 (0.74;0.82), AUC 0.77 (0.72;0.82)), using handwash products (AUC 0.70 (0.65;0.75), AUC 0.76 (0.71;0.80)), and frequently washing hands (AUC 0.71 (0.66;0.76), AUC 0.75 (0.71;0.80)). We conclude that coping appraisal was the explanatory factor most frequently included in statistical models explaining self-reported intentions to carry out non-pharmaceutical health actions in the Swedish outlined context, and that variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite scientific uncertainties surrounding a recent mass vaccination campaign.

            "text": "Although encouraging the public to undertake specific protective behaviors has proved useful in containing outbreaks of infectious disease [1] , more research has been called for examining the social, demographic, and cultural factors that influence these efforts [2] . This is particularly important to understanding people's hesitations to heed official advice, particularly in the absence of clear scientific evidence regarding the disease outbreak [3] . The AS03-adjuvanted PandemrixH was the most commonly used vaccine in response to the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in Europe [4] ; Finland and Sweden recommended this vaccine to their entire populations. In August 2010 reports of a possible association between exposure to the vaccine and occurrence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents emerged in both the latter countries, which led to a review of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Subsequently, increased narcolepsy diagnoses associated with the start of the campaign have been confirmed [5] . In Sweden, scientific uncertainty regarding the safety of this mass vaccination was both publicly discussed [6] and questioned by researchers [7] .",

It has also been pointed out that behavioral research in epidemics should not only identify determinants of individual and population behavioral responses, but also clarify the mechanisms underpinning these [11] . Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) [12, 13] posits that an intention to perform protective activities is determined by perceptions of threat and the ability to cope. In addition to intentions and preceptions, a recent review concluded that protective behavior needs to be investigated with regard to sociodemiograpic characteristics in order to identify the ''contagious'' effect and contextual nature of perceptions and mediating mechanisms [14] . For instance, coping appraisals are made in interaction with environmental resources, which vary in availability across population subgroups. Protective behavior associated with influenza outbreaks has also been investigated with regard to general estimates of health status [15] , but few studies have used validated measures of self-rated health as a means for the sub categorization. At present, several such measures are available for use in population-based research [16] .",

In this model, protective behaviors during outbreaks are restricted to two categories: increased personal hygiene (use of disinfectants and other handwash products; frequent washing of hands when having touched common objects, such as door knobs) and social distancing (staying home from work or school; avoiding use of public transportation). The intentions to carry out a protective behavior are assessed by asking whether the respondent would try to perform the behavior during a mild and severe influenza outbreak, respectively. Both outbreak scenarios described personal risk of infection as high (i.e., 1 in 3 people infected). The mild influenza description details moderate health consequences (less than 1 in 1000 infected people dying) and a minor lifestyle impact (services mainly operating normally). The severe scenario describes serious health consequences (1 in 50-100 infected people dying) and services no longer being able to operate normally.",

Based on the notion of subjective expected utility [18] , which postulates that people's choices are a product of assessments of probability and utility of options, healthrelated methodologies such as the PMT and the Health Belief Model [19] have included formally quantified models of subjective health risk perceptions, i.e., as the likelihood of contracting a disease multiplied by disease severity. Together with different types of cost-benefit valuations and self-efficacy expectations, these perceptions of risk are presumed to determine health-protective behaviors. In the present study, the collection and analysis of data on protection motivation in relation to influenza outbreaks are structured according to the PMT. This theory suggests that threat appraisal will generate an intention to act, while coping appraisal determines the type of action. Threat appraisal is in this study characterized in its three dimensions [11, [20] [21] :",

The primary end points for the ensuing analyses were intentions to increase social distancing (staying home while not ill; avoid public transportation), and enhance personal hygiene (use of handwash; frequent washing of hands after touching common objects) during mild and severe influenza outbreaks, respectively. The theoretical model of potential explanatory factors was used as the basis for the analysis. For each endpoint, logistic regression analyses were applied using the items in the model as explanatory variables. These included trust in official information; variables corresponding to PMT items (the threat appraisal items of perceived personal risk, emotional response (worry), perceived severity; and the coping appraisal items of general response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs); variables representing the SF-8 summary items (PCS and MCS); and sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, educational level, living with partner, living with child, and employment). When used as response variables, ordinal variables were dichotomized (agree/do not agree). To contrast expected perceptions against other perceptions, the variables were converted with the agreement scores in the expected extreme as one category. For threat appraisal, agreement scores in the low extreme were contrasted against other opinions, except for the estimates of the severity of the consequences of getting infected where the scores in the high extreme were contrasted against the other opinions.

While the proportion of persons reporting intentions to improve personal hygiene during influenza outbreaks ranged between 45-85%, the proportion reporting intentions to increase social distancing did not exceed 25%. This pattern can generally be explained by the notion that the initial behavioral changes during an influenza outbreak are more likely to resemble familiar reactions and well-known routines [27] , such as increasing personal hygiene, rather than changes that require deductive planning, such as increasing social distancing.",

            "text": "The explanatory models developed in this study showed statistical associations ranging from strong (staying home without being ill) to acceptable (avoiding public transportation and increasing personal hygiene). Among the explanatory factors considered, coping appraisal was the factor most frequently showing associations (as displayed by odds ratios) with the reported intentions. In a validation analysis (data not shown), we fitted each model fully (including all terms in the five explanatory factors categories trust of information, threat appraisal, coping appraisal, sociodemographic factors, and self-rated health) and calculated the proportion of correctly classified cases for these full models for all eight scenarios. Then we left the terms from one of the five categories out separately, and calculated the proportion of correctly classified cases for each of these subset models. We found that the proportion of correctly classified cases without coping appraisal was lower than the corresponding proportion for all full models and lower or equal to the corresponding proportion for 28 of the 32 models excluding one of the other four categories. We interpret these observations combined as indicative evidence that of the explanatory factors considered, coping appraisal was the factor strongest associated with the reported intentions. Analogous to our results, a recent British web-based survey of university employees found that coping appraisal was the principal predictor of variability in protective intentions during pandemics [21] , and response costs have been reported as the largest predictor for emergency nurses not reporting to work during an influenza pandemic [28] . A contributing influence to the lesser relative importance of threat appraisal suggested by our results may be a Scandinavian tendency to perceive risks lower than in other countries [29] [30] [31] . One of the explanations for this tendency is that the media in Scandinavia appear to report more about risks abroad with less attention to risk inside the country [29] . In contrast to our results, self-efficacy during the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in Hong Kong was found to be only weakly associated with social distancing [25] . However, Hong Kong residents are limited in their ability to avoid crowds, and the relatively mild impact of the outbreak could have led to the notion that people saw no reason to jeopardize their economic well-being and curtail other social activities. A socio-geographic theory of protective behaviors during infectious disease outbreaks suggested that efficacy beliefs of Chinese living in the UK and the Netherlands were comparable to those of native UK and Dutch residents during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [32] , indicating that country of residence is more important than ethnicity or country and culture of origin in determination of protective behaviors. However, with coordinated regional disease control efforts and increasing influence from social media, this may change.",

As also found in a Norwegian study from the same time Table 4 . Simple and multiple logistic regression models of explanatory factors for the intention to avoid using public transport displayed by influenza outbreak scenario. period [33] , the Swedish women in this study were more disposed to enhance their protective behaviors related to personal hygiene than were men. One explanation of this finding could be an interaction with concerns about the consequences of getting infected. A recent study from the U.S. reported that women were more worried than men about getting seriously ill or even dying during a severe influenza outbreak [34] . However, no gender differences with regard to threat appraisal were reported from the Norwegian study [33] . Originally, we did not include interaction terms in our statistical analyses. A secondary analysis (data not shown) did not reveal any statistically significant interaction between gender and any threat or coping appraisal item such that omitting the interaction from the model would disturb the estimation of the main effects. Therefore, an alternative explanation of our findings is that the female respondents were more disposed to enhance their protective behaviors related to personal hygiene than the male respondents because Swedish women purchase and use hygiene products more often than men [35] , and, in consequence, were more confident about the practical handling of handwash and liquid soap. Conversely, men were more inclined to stay home without being ill during influenza outbreaks. This could be explained by the fact that fewer of the employed Swedish men (12%) than women (46%) were at the time of the study working in caring or educational occupations that require physical presence at the workplace, such as nursing, child care, and teaching [36] . In other words, a larger proportion of men could consider the possibility of staying home while continuing to work during an ongoing influenza outbreak, which was not an option for many women. These findings indicate that more research is needed to understand gender-related differences in protective behavior during influenza outbreaks.",

However, the study has also important limitations that must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. The demographic characteristics available may not be the most important factors biasing the results. For instance, it is possible that individuals with low trust in official information about influenza were under-represented, and anxious individuals worrying about disease risks were over-represented, among the participants. Moreover, interpreting cross-sectional data on protective behaviors is difficult because they confound the motivation and accuracy-associated aspects regarding the causaltemporal relationship between perception and behavior [37] . The motivational hypothesis assumes that high perceived risk leads people's intention to adopt protective behaviors, while the accuracy hypothesis suggests that people who act in a more risky way should also feel more at risk. As an example, individuals having physical contact with many people through their occupation may have been aware of that daily routines are associated with a higher risk for getting infected. Accordingly, a negative correlation may indicate accurate relative risk perceptions, i.e. that people are aware of their risk status [20, 37] . Further longitudinal studies of protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks are thereby warranted [38] .",

            "text": "Another limitation is that we assessed self-reported intentions rather than objectively measured behavior. Nevertheless, intentions are a well-validated proxy for behavior predicting a moderate amount (30-42%) of the variance in actual behavior across a wide range of contexts [39, 40] . Moreover, proponents of dual-process health behavior models have suggested that analytic central and emotional-heuristic processes work in concert to select decisions [14] , and under certain circumstances emotions may even be the dominant force [41] . While the PMT used in this study does include an emotional component, it still represents a cognitive appraisal model in assuming that cognitive risk assessment determines experience of fear. Such a model is naturally applicable for the study of behaviors aimed at fending off long-term disease, where fear is likely to be less imminent and therefore secondary to more rational reflections about gains and losses related to protective behavior. However, in an acute threat situation, like a severe influenza outbreak, emotional aspects might gain more immediate importance. This would even be more likely during periods of scientific uncertainty, when fewer facts are available. It is in this context interesting to note that coping appraisal in this study was found to be the motivation factor that contributed most to the discriminatory performance despite the fact that threataffect was included in the general model, although indirectly through cognitive assessment. However, what role affect-or emotion-based judgments play in interaction with threat and coping appraisals is still an issue in need of clarification. Finally, it should be noted that there were relatively small differences between the reported intended behaviors associated to the mild and severe scenarios, respectively. One explanation of this observation can be the fact that the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was relatively mild in Sweden, and that the respondents, wrongfully, related the severe scenario to their recent personal experience rather than the scenario description. However, the lack Table 6 . Simple and multiple logistic regression models of explanatory factors for the intention to wash hands after touching common objects displayed by influenza outbreak scenario. of difference can also be seen as a sign of its own, i.e. that the Swedish population may not be fully aware of the seriousness of a full influenza pandemic. Failure to monitor the beliefs and attitudes of the public has recently been identified as a weakness in preparedness strategies against infectious disease outbreaks [42] . We examined how items in a general explanatory model of intended health behavior were associated with personal hygiene and social distancing practices following a questioned mass vaccination campaign against influenza in the Swedish population. We observed a relatively high trust in official recommendations and a higher proportion of intentions to improve personal hygiene than those used to increase social distancing. Among the explanatory factors considered, coping appraisal was the factor most frequently included in models explaining self-reported intentions. Variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite the uncertainties surrounding the mass vaccination during the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak. The results also show that not just from a third world perspective [43] it is necessary to consider that not all population sub groups have the same predispositions to enact specific behaviors to protect their health. For instance, they suggest that further studies are needed of gender differences in protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks. We conclude that developing interventions that support the general population's efforts to perform self-protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks and longitudinal studies of such interventions across several influenza seasons are warranted also in European countries.",
