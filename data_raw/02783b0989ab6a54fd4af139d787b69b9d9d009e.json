            "text": "For more than four decades the cause of most type A influenza virus infections of humans has been attributed to only two viral subtypes, A/H1N1 or A/H3N2. In contrast, avian and other vertebrate species are a reservoir of type A influenza virus genome diversity, hosting strains representing at least 120 of 144 combinations of 16 viral hemagglutinin and 9 viral neuraminidase subtypes. Viral genome segment reassortments and mutations emerging within this reservoir may spawn new influenza virus strains as imminent epidemic or pandemic threats to human health and poultry production. Traditional methods to detect and differentiate influenza virus subtypes are either time-consuming and labor-intensive (culture-based) or remarkably insensitive (antibody-based). Molecular diagnostic assays based upon reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have short assay cycle time, and high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, none of these diagnostic tests determine viral gene nucleotide sequences to distinguish strains and variants of a detected pathogen from one specimen to the next. Decision-quality, strain-and variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information may be critical for public health, infection control, surveillance, epidemiology, or medical/veterinary treatment planning. The Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM-Flu) is a robust, highly multiplexed and target gene sequencing-based alternative to both traditional culture-or biomarker-based diagnostic tests. RPM-Flu is a single, simultaneous differential diagnostic assay for all subtype combinations of type A influenza viruses and for 30 other viral and bacterial pathogens that may cause influenzalike illness. These other pathogen targets of RPM-Flu may co-infect and compound the morbidity and/or mortality of patients with influenza. The informative specificity of a single RPM-Flu test represents specimen-specific viral gene sequences as determinants of virus type, A/HN subtype, virulence, host-range, and resistance to antiviral agents.",

Four pandemic outbreaks in the last century, one catastrophic, appear to have introduced the subsequently prevalent seasonal human influenza virus subtypes A/H1N1 (Spanish flu, 1918), A/H2N2 (Asian flu, 1957), A/H3N2 (Hong Kong flu, 1968), and A/H1N1 again (Swine flu, 1976; Russian flu, 1977).

In distinct contrast, wildfowl species are natural hosts and a global reservoir for the majority of possible influenza A/HN subtypes. Many of these variant strains appear to be associated with endemic infections, often asymptomatic in avian hosts [1] . Fortunately, infectious transmission of such avian influenza virus strains between humans continues to be limited. However, history suggests that further evolution of these or other type A influenza strains could emerge as a next pandemic strain. Similarly, variant type A influenza virus strains have emerged from time to time, imposing serious costs and burdens upon poultry and livestock production.",

This result is achieved even for instances (HA3, NA2, B-HA, B-NA and both the type A and type B M genes) where the RPM-Flu detector tile sequences and actual vaccine gene sequences do not precisely match. This reflects the robust capability of the RPM-Flu resequencing microarray to determine accurately the match or alternative mismatch of each target gene nucleotide relative to corresponding nucleotide of the detector sequence.

The subjects were evaluated at the time of specimen collection and associated with one of three cohorts: apparently healthy and afebrile individuals; those diagnosed with febrile respiratory illness (FRI); and those diagnosed with pneumonia (confirmed by chest x-ray). A group of 298 specimens were analyzed using both the RPM-Flu assay and a validated benchmark RT-PCR assay for type A influenza virus described by Freed et al. [10] . Thirty specimens were identified as positive for type A influenza virus by both assays, and only 1 specimen was found to be negative by RPM-Flu and positive by RT-PCR. The remaining 267 specimens were found to be negative for influenza virus by both assays. All of the influenza-positive specimens were from participants that had been assigned to the FRI cohort. Table 3 shows the calculation of high clinical sensitivity (97%) and even higher clinical specificity (100%) of RPM-Flu for detection and identification of type A human influenza virus, compared with results from testing the same specimens with the benchmark RT-PCR-based assay. Similarly high clinical sensitivity and high clinical specificity of RPM-Flu have been demonstrated with in the same ensemble of clinical specimens with respect to other simultaneously targeted pathogens of the assay, when similarly robust RT-PCR test panels were used for benchmark testing of matched specimens (e.g. human adenoviruses of subgroups B1, B2 and E; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; results not shown).",

The single specimen single aliquot RPM-Flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria, and these were each selected as a respiratory pathogens reported to cause ''flu-like'' symptoms at some stage of human infection. Implementation of a highly multiplexed differential diagnostic assay as RPM-Flu would be of great advantage in anticipation of highly likely future influenza outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. For many decades, leaders in the area of influenza epidemic and pandemic risk assessment and outbreak management have reviewed the pathology of influenza with respect to rapid deterioration and patient deaths attributable to secondary bacterial infections and pneumonia [23, 24] .",

Such a traditional regulatory clearance timeline may assure safety and efficacy of diagnostic devices beyond imaginable limits of liability, but it also assures that best practice standards for clinical diagnostics are constrained to technologies that perform with nearly obsolete capabilities and specifications. Within the last decade resequencing microarrays have been introduced for research applications and clinical research [26, 27, 28] . It would be disappointing to anticipate that another decade or more may pass before benefits from diagnostic implementations of RPM or other highly multiplexed sequencing-based platforms can be realized in routine clinical diagnostics.

Recent outbreaks of ''bird flu'' may foreshadow an eventual pandemic outbreak, in the emergence of strains and variants with enhanced pathogenicity, virulence and transmissibility in human hosts. Examples of such outbreaks include A/H5N1 Hong Kong, 1997; H9N2 Hong Kong, 1999; A/H7N7 Netherlands, 2003; A/ H5N1 Southeast Asia, 2004. Some avian A/H5 and A/H7 strains of influenza virus are recognized as highly pathogenic (HP) in domestic poultry and concerns arise that this phenotype may carry over to infections of humans. Since 1997, human infections associated with the Eurasian-African lineage of A/H5N1 HP avian influenza virus have been associated with 467 documented cases in 15 countries with high mortality (282 deaths) [2; updated 30 December 2009].",

            "text": "Similar analytical sensitivity for seasonal influenza virus detection using RPM-Flu and rRT-PCR panel assays. The Limit of Detection (LoD) for seasonal A/H1N1 and seasonal A/H3N2 influenza viruses are presented as the number of tissue culture (TCID 50 ) or egg culture (EID 50 ) infectious units used for each assay that are demonstrated to result in .95% positive assay outcomes. The relation of tissue culture and egg culture infectious units typically vary with respect to specific influenza virus strain and inoculum. For this table an estimated ratio of 16 EID 50 : 1 TCID 50 is based upon results of testing the same A/Hawaii/15/2001 (H1N1) strain by both the JBAIDS and CDC rRT-PCR panels. The recently FDA-cleared 510(k)080570 the ''CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel'' is a test designed to specifically detect contemporary A/H1, A/H3 and A/H5 (Asian Lineage) influenza viruses in humans, as accessed 02 Oct 2009 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf8/ k080570.pdf. In characterizations of analytical sensitivity of this test panel, the CDC has reported analytical LoD in terms of egg culture infectivity titers (EID 50 /ml). The Department of Defense Joint Biological Agent Identification & Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) has implemented the same RT-PCR test and reported LoD in TCID 50 units of cell culture infectivity, as accessed 02 Oct 2009 at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/UCM180067.pdf. We estimate CDC rRT-PCR LoD results shown in Table 7 using TCID 50 units based on the results of both CDC and JBAIDS for A/Hawaii/15/2001(H1N1). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.t007pairs). While this RT-PCR panel may infer influenza virus subtype, not even testing for the NA component, the assay result is only based on a pattern of signals from a small panel of RT-PCR primer-probes.Some RT-PCR protocols require serial analysis with hierarchical panels of primer-probes in order to expand the practical multiplicity of pathogen targets or variants. This is the case with the benchmark PCR testing used in this report -a type A influenza virus-positive specimen may be identified in a first round RT-PCR panel, followed by testing with another panel to distinguish A/H1 from A/H3. Failure to establish subtype A/H1 or A/H3 in the follow-on test is a first tier screening results forpossible identification of the 2009 Novel A/H1N1 influenza virus outbreak strain. According to the FACT SHEET FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS: INTERPRETING CDC HUMAN INFLUENZA VIRUS REAL-TIME RT-PCR DETECTION AND CHARACTER-IZATION PANEL FOR RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS (NPS, NS, TS, NPS/TS, NA1) AND VIRAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS (Authorized by FDA 02 May 2009), ''The rRT-PCR Flu Panel (NPS, NS, TS, NPS/TS, NA) should be ordered to diagnose influenza A infections caused by influenza A or B and subtype determination of seasonal human influenza A virus (seasonal A/H1 or A/H3) to be used as a first tier test for the in vitro qualitative detection of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in patients suspected of having novel influenza A (H1N1) infection. If the test result is positive for influenza A and negative for seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes, the laboratory should test the specimen with the Swine Influenza Real-time RT-PCR Detection Panel (rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel) for the presumptive detection of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection.''",
