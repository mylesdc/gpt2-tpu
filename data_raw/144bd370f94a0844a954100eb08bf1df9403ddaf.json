Beside vaccination, the discovery of new anti-viral agents represents an important strategy to encounter seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains. The bacterial extra-cellular ribonuclease binase is a well-studied RNase from Bacillus pumilus. Treatment with binase was shown to improve survival of laboratory animals infected with different RNA viruses. Although binase reduced IAV titer in vitro and in vivo, the mode of action (MOA) of binase against IAV at the molecular level has yet not been studied in depth and remains elusive.",

Despite their seasonal character, influenza epidemics are unpredictable and have been recognized as a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality [1] . Influenza virus infection leads to a disease that results in 0.25-0.5 million deaths annually worldwide [2] . Currently, two classes of anti-virals are available for the treatment of seasonal human influenza: neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) and M2channel blockers (rimantadine and amantadine) acting on viral spread and entry, respectively [3] . Nevertheless, vaccination is still the most effective preventive measure, regardless to the constant changes of the viral antigenic epitopes (antigen drift), demanding the annual renewal of the selected vaccine strains [4, 5] . Furthermore, based on the segmented nature of IAV genome, co-infections can lead to reassortants with completely new antigenic characteristics (antigen shift) that can cause pandemic outbreaks [6, 7] . Thus, the efficacy of currently approved control strategies is limited because IAVs frequently escape the immune response via antigen drift and shift [8] . Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy that is effective irrespective of viral subtype by directly attacking the genetic material of the virus would be beneficial.",

Additionally, we found that the anti-viral activity of binase was not related to a direct interaction with viral RNA within intact viral particles. Envelope-and viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP)-protected viral RNA genome of H1N1pdm09 was not affected by binase following 30 min of incubation of intact viral particles with binase at the concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 5 U/ml. As analyzed by RT-PCR at different cycle numbers (20, 25, 30 cycles), the protected full length viral RNA remained unaffected by binase, suggesting that binase did not reduce the virus titer by affecting the cell free virus particles.

(Fig. 2b, c) , we investigated the intra-cellular effect of binase on H1N1pdm09 during a single replication cycle (12 h p.i.) and multiple replication cycles (24 h p.i.). MDCK-II cells were treated with binase 4 h before infection. Cells were then washed before adding the inoculum that was subsequently replaced by binase-containing media for up to 8 h after infection. The binase-containing media was then replaced with fresh binase-free media and virus titers were determined 12 (single-cycle) and 24 h a b (multi-cycle) later. This way we intended to avoid any extra-cellular effect of binase on the virus particles before initial infection, as binase was absent during the infection process. Washing the cells twice after removing the binasecontaining media before adding the fresh media without binase, removed all remaining extra-cellular binase from the cell monolayers. This had been verified by immunofluorescent microscopy using an anti-binase primary antibody (data not shown). By analyzing H1N1pdm09 viral titers, collected 12 h p.i., we found that binase could significantly reduce viral propagation in MDCK-II cells by 22%. However, this virus reduction effect was potentiated at 24 h p.i. to reach 87% (Fig. 3a) .",

RT-PCR analysis of the virus particle-protected vRNA, using specific segment primers to amplify full-length PB2 segment for different number of cycles (20, 25, 30, 35) , showed that binase does not affect protected H1N1pdm09 vRNA. b Internalization of binase (10 5 U/ml) into MDCK-II cells was detected by Western blot analysis 8 h post incubation (lane 2).

These few licensed viral-protein-dependent antiviral therapies are challenged by the continuous genomic evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to overcome the selective pressure due to their overuse [35] . Consequently, new viralindependent anti-viral strategies are urgently needed and represent excellent alternative anti-influenza remedies. The effect of binase on viral NP production was analyzed by Western blotting using a NP-specific antibody and calculated by setting the percentage of untreated cells at 100%. NP-specific signals were quantified and normalized to beta-actin expression (loading control) and calculated relative to the values obtained from cells without binase treatment (arbitrarily set to 100%). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test and two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001) detail to further evaluate the applicability of binase as a potential anti-influenza agent. The current influenza anti-viral drugs target the function of the variable surface glycoproteins, NA and M2. This anti-influenza activity of NA-inhibitors and M2blockers can be easily subverted and resisted via acquisition of distinct single or multiple amino acid (aa) residues in the corresponding viral proteins [7] . In contrast, the genome of IAV (vRNAs) has highly conserved regions, which can provide a constant site for targeting by different ribonucleases. However, some natural ribonucleases may be challenged with their high molecular weight (Mwt), existence of natural RNAase inhibitors and possible immunogenicity [36] .",

            "text": "In this study, the results obtained from the first set experiments, including HAI and RT-PCR analysis of binase-treated virions, could exclude a detectable effect of binase on the ability of free virus particles to infect MDCK-II cells. This finding restricts the MOA of binase to an activity directly within the infected cell. Yet, previous studies [13, 21, 22] observed an anti-viral effect after pre-incubation of the virus with binase prior to infection. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the binase added to the virions before infection was still present during infection. Therefore, binase might have entered through the interaction of the cationic binase protein with the negative charge of the cell surface [13] . The receptors of the IAV hemagglutinin on the host cell surface carry a negative charge provided by In the control, binase was absent. Statistical significance was investigated using the Student's t-test. ***P < 0.001 the sialic acid [37, 38] allowing the binase to contact the cell surface via electrostatic interaction and to be internalized via endocytosis independently of the virus [39] . Since the IAV enter the cells in a similar way, binase could further utilize such endosomes for efficient uptake. Interestingly, binase seems to have the ability to penetrate into cultured mammalian cells. In addition to the MDCK-II cells used for this study, binase was previously reported to be detected in A549 cells [23] . Next we assessed the ability of binase to impair H1N1pdm09 propagation at a non-toxic anti-viral concentration, while preventing direct interaction of virus particles with binase prior to initial infection. Compared to its anti-H1N1pdm09 activity at 24 h p.i., binase showed a significant anti-viral effect at 12 h p.i., which was not very strong probably due to the restricted uptake and accumulation of the binase into the host cells during the single replication cycle. This was overcome after multicycle replication assayed after 24 h p.i.. This significant anti-viral effect was also shown for a H3N2vict strain indicating that binase is efficiently working at 24 h p.i., regardless of the strain subtype. Based on these aforementioned observations, we advanced to test the idea of an intra-cellular MOA by investigating the effect of binase on the accumulation of viral NP, viral RNAs, mRNA of cellular housekeeping genes and on the expression activity of a mini-genome system. The quantification of viral RNAs and of viral NP in binase-treated cells, as well as of the amount of cellular mRNA encoding housekeeping genes and the expression of a reporter gene by the viral mini-genome are all showing an inhibitory effect of binase. In a similar way, it was recently shown that the cellular double-stranded-RNAactivated RNase L, a critical component of interferonregulated anti-viral host responses, exerts its anti-viral activity during influenza virus infection by targeting specific sites in viral RNAs [40] . Unlike the cellular RNase L which has the tendency to target also the same specific sites in host cell RNAs, no significant impact on the expression of cellular housekeeping genes was observed. This has further supported the hypothesis that the IAV genome within the infected cell is the main target of binase.",

Here we show that the bacterial ribonuclease binase inhibits H1N1pdm09 propagation by degrading viral RNAs and thereby impairing the viral gene expression within infected MDCK-II cells, resulting in reduced intra-cellular viral protein accumulation. Assuming that the mode of action of binase is directed against the viral RNAs within the infected cell it should be indiscriminative and effective, regardless of the IAV subtype. This supports the idea of binase as a promising anti viral that might allow a targeted anti-influenza approach.",
