The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.",

The CFR can be defined as the probability that a case dies from the infection. Several variations of the definition of \"case\" are used for different infections, as discussed in Box 1. Under all these definitions, the CFR characterizes the severity of an infection and is useful for planning and determining the intensity of a response to an outbreak [1, 2] . Moreover, the CFR may be compared between cases who do and do not receive particular treatments as a way of trying to estimate the causal impact of these treatments on survival. Such causal inference might ideally be done in a randomized trial in which individuals are randomly assigned to treatments, but this is often not possible during an outbreak for logistical, ethical, and other reasons [3] . Therefore, observational estimates of CFR under different treatment conditions may be the only available means to assess the impact of various treatments.",

Such factors are \"unchangeable\" in the sense that they are not candidates for intervention in the setting of the outbreak, though some could, of course, change over longer timescales. The goal of estimating the CFR in groups defined by such unchangeable factors is not to understand the causal role of these factors in mortality, but to develop a predictive model for mortality that might be used to improve prognostic accuracy or identify disparities.

Such individuals may or may not be symptomatic, though asymptomatic ones may go undetected. The symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR) defines a case as someone who is infected and shows certain symptoms. Infection in many outbreaks is given several gradations, including confirmed (definitive laboratory confirmation), probable (high degree of suspicion, by various clinical and epidemiologic criteria, without laboratory confirmation), and possible or suspected (lower degree of suspicion).

Therefore, the CFR will typically be higher among detected cases than among the entire population of cases, given that the latter may include individuals with mild, subclinical, and (under some definitions of \"case\") asymptomatic presentations. Laboratory confirmation as an inclusion criterion may reduce this bias if it is able to detect a wider spectrum of presentations, or may exacerbate it if the probability of receiving a laboratory test is higher for more severe cases and/or if test sensitivity is higher for more severe cases. The magnitude of this bias may be uncertain for a long period because the spectrum of clinical presentations is itself uncertain at the start of an outbreak of a new disease [12, 26] . All proposed approaches to estimate and correct for this bias (Table 1 ) require auxiliary data sources to estimate how the reported subset of cases compares with the overall population of cases. The availability of such auxiliary data sources will depend on the context of the outbreak.",

Therefore, at any moment in time, the list of cases includes people who will die and whose death has not yet occurred, or has occurred but not yet been reported. Thus dividing the cumulative number of reported deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases at any moment will underestimate the true CFR. The key determinants of the magnitude of the bias are the epidemic growth rate and the distribution of delays from case-reporting to death-reporting; the longer the delays and the faster the growth rate, the greater the bias. Heuristically, the underestimate will be proportionate to the expansion of the epidemic during the delay between the time a case enters the database to the time the death of that case enters the database (if it occurs). Fig 1 illustrates an example where the delay is 3 weeks, the epidemic doubling time is 2 weeks, and the underestimate is by a factor of 2 3/2 2.8.",

If some individuals die before they can be admitted to a hospital, they will by definition not become hospitalized. Therefore, even in the absence of any effect of hospitalization on the risk of death, there will be fewer deaths among those hospitalized than among those not hospitalized. We will refer to this bias as \"survivorship bias.\" In an ongoing epidemic, there will typically be a delay between the reporting of a case and the reporting of the death of that case, if the infected person dies. Thus, at any moment, there will be some cases reported who will die of the infection but who have not yet died, or whose deaths have not yet been reported. Simple division of the number of deaths reported by week w (green), by the number of cases reported by week w (blue) will underestimate the CFR because the numerator does not include all those cases in the denominator who will eventually die. With a reporting delay of 3 weeks for deaths compared to cases, the reported deaths curve will be shifted 3 weeks to the right, relative to the curve of the total number of cases reported by week w who will die (red). If the epidemic doubling time is 2 weeks, as shown here, the underestimate of CFR will be by a factor of about 2 3/2 2.8, with the exponent being the number of epidemic doubling times that pass between case reporting and death reporting. In reality, there will be a distribution of reporting delays rather than a fixed delay, making this a heuristic rather than exact approach. The problem is ameliorated in an epidemic that grows more slowly or less than exponentially. For more details, see references in Table 1 . This bias can be eliminated using data on the time d since the person became a case. The analysis would then compare the risk of death between those individuals who became Table 2 .

Selection bias in this setting occurs because the exposure and the outcome both affect the probability of inclusion in the database. Follow-up of a cohort of contacts ascertained before becoming cases could eliminate hospitalization and mortality as predictors of inclusion in the database, thus eliminating the form of selection bias we have discussed. It would provide an opportunity for Subscript P represents the population values, while subscript D represents the values measured for those cases included in the data base; selection bias produces the discrepancy. The extent of selection bias may be measured as OR s \u00bc S 00 S 11 S 01 S 10 , where S ij is the probability a case with exposure (hospitalization at day 8) i and outcome (mortality) j appears in the database. In this example, selection bias spuriously enhances the negative association between hospitalization on day 8 and death, on all scales: RR, OR, and RD. gathering data on severity and other predictors of exposure and outcome, which would facilitate control of confounding, though not guarantee to eliminate it. Such a cohort would also provide a natural setting for analyses that avoid survivorship bias. The cost of such improvements in inference would be the need to ascertain such contacts and maintain surveillance of those individuals, following them to obtain data on relevant covariates. Such a strategy-which has been followed in cases of exposed health-care workers in settings with high resources and few cases-would likely have benefits for the individuals followed (e.g., increasing the probability they receive care if infected) and for reducing transmission (if such individuals were promptly isolated upon evidence of infection). However, it has not been possible so far in the large Ebola outbreaks in West Africa to do this routinely.",

            "text": "It is often of interest to predict the probability of mortality for an individual case of an infectious disease based on that individual's demographic and clinical data, without placing any causal interpretation on the factors used to predict outcome. For example, in 2009, there was much interest in whether morbid obesity (or obesity in general) was predictive of worse outcome in infection with the novel pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1 [34] .The primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. Similarly, observations of disparate rates of severe outcomes by geography within New York City did not initially involve causal judgments about why certain areas had worse outcomes, although they could be used to guide enhancement of services in areas with worse outcomes [35] . Even for a well-understood disease like polio, it may be necessary to identify unusual demographic patterns of mortality in order to understand and respond effectively to an outbreak [36] . Prognostic exercises such as these cannot suffer from confounding bias because no causal interpretation is attached to the conclusions. They can, however, suffer from selection bias. Returning to the Ebola context, one might wish to know whether pregnant women infected with Ebola are at greater risk of death from Ebola infection than other cases [37] , for example, in order to give them greater supportive care. If the probability of entering the database depends on whether an Ebola patient is pregnant and on whether she ultimately dies of the infection, then the probability of death given pregnancy will likely differ in the database from the value in the population of direct interest for a clinical or public health decision maker. If the goal of analysis is to inform public health decision makers on the value of efforts to prevent infection in pregnant women, then the population-wide CFR among pregnant women is the value of direct interest. If, on the other hand, the goal of analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them, the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter-those admitted to the treatment center.

It will also differ from that in the overall population. The general point is that selection bias can be operative if the population on which analysis is performed is not a representative sample of the population for which the value of the CFR is sought, and selection bias of this form can lead to spurious conclusions in prognostic estimates as well as in causal ones. As in the case of causal inference, prognostic estimates will avoid selection bias to the extent they can be performed on a randomly chosen cohort of cases, identified via tracing of healthy contacts, for example.",

Moreover, treatment facilities might be evaluated by the proportion of their patients who survive; here the relative CFR calculated would be for treatment in one facility versus treatment in another. There will be a temptation to conclude that treatment facilities with higher CFR are doing a worse job-that is, to apply a causal interpretation to observed differences in the CFR. Even in settings with more resources to measure covariates, methods of risk-adjustment of comparative outcomes to account for the mix of patients seen are complex and controversial [38] . In an emergency setting, with few covariates available to characterize the \"case mix\" of a health care provider, causal interpretation of differences in CFR would be particularly prone to error, potentially producing conclusions that mislead and thereby damage control efforts. For instance, if through confounding, larger referral treatment centers primarily receive patients who have survived infection for some time and are therefore less likely to die, independently of treatment, this may be erroneously interpreted as more effective treatment in these centers. Similarly, if certain treatment centers preferentially admit the most symptomatic patients, they may falsely appear to be less effective or even harmful to patient outcome. With at least five separate sources of bias in CFR or relative CFR estimates, and only imperfect solutions typically available for most due to lack of data, separating causal from non-causal factors in relative CFR estimation seems extremely risky. This is not to deny that data should be gathered or analyzed; on the contrary, the biases here suggest that more thorough data gathering is necessary before analyses of such quantities as relative CFR are relied upon for any decision.",

Such studies-in which a key endpoint will be mortality-will be vulnerable to the sorts of biases described in this article, particularly in cases in which the true effect size of the treatment is limited. The biases described here should be kept in mind when evaluating the conclusions of such studies, and wherever possible, studies should be designed to minimize them. Small studies conducted using systematic approaches to enrollment and follow-up of patients may be more precise and less biased than studies with larger sample sizes that use databases collected for other reasons. Similarly, there may be situations in which efforts are made to administer scarce therapeutic agents to those most likely to benefit from them.

This estimate might be expected to differ for different values of d if, for example, early hospitalization was more beneficial than late hospitalization. If not different, the estimates of the causal effect of hospitalization for several values of d could be combined. Restriction to those alive at the time from which we want to estimate the effect of hospitalization would eliminate survivorship bias. However, two other biases, described below, could still affect the inference.",
