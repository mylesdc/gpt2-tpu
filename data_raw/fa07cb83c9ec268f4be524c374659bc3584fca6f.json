Because of various limitations in current laboratory animal models, it is essential to develop new alternative animal models for influenza virus research aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human. Method: We investigated the replicative efficiency of influenza H1N1 virus (classic strain (Influenza A/PR/8/34), seasonal influenza isolate (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/02/09) and swine-origin human influenza virus (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/ 07/09)) at Day1,2,4,6 and 9 p.i. using TCID 50 and qPCR assay in tree shrew model. Body temperature was monitored in the morning and evening for 3 days before infection and for 14 days. Seroconversion was detected by determining the neutralizing antibody titers against the challenge viruses in the pre-and exposure serum samples collected before infection and at 14 days p.i., respectively. Lungs and tracheas of tree shews were collected at day 14 post p.i. for histopathological analysis. Lectinhistochemistry analysis was conducted to identify the distribution of SA\u03b12,3 Gal and SA\u03b12,6 Gal receptors in the lung and trachea. Results: The infected tree shrew displayed mild or moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms and pathological changes in respiratory tracts. The human H1N1 influenza virus may replicate in the upper respiratory tract of tree shrews. Analysis of the receptors distribution in the respiratory tract of tree shrews by lectinhistochemistry showed that sialic acid (SA)\u03b12,6-Gal receptors were widely distributed in the trachea and nasal mucosa, whereas (SA)\u03b12,3-Gal receptor was the main receptor in the lung tissue.",

Generally, mice, guinea pigs and hamsters models are widely used for influenza virus research. However, they do not exhibit some of the clinical symptoms detected in humans such as nasal exudates, fever, sneezing, and coughing, and only display hypothermia and weight loss. Additionally mice, unlike other rodents like guinea pigs, cotton rats and hamsters, cannot be infected with primary human virus clinical isolates readily, and thus are in mostly used in the research of mouse-adapted strains [9] . Therefore, the pathogenesis of influenza virus could not be studied adequately in rodent models as generally recognized. It is well-known that ferrets and non-human primates (e.g. macaques) are excellent mammalian animal models for studies of influenza virus pathogenicity and host immunity, and moreover, the clinical signs of influenza virus infection in ferrets resemble those in humans [10, 11] . Although these species provide useful models for influenza virus pathogenesis studies, some disadvantages of those such as availability, cost, husbandry demands and ethical constraints limit the use of them for such research [12] . Until recently, more efforts have been focused on development of animal models in attempt to provide more alternative animal models for study of influenza virus pathogenesis and antivirals.",

Currently, tree shrew models are mainly used for research into the nervous, digestive and urinary systems, among others [15, 16] . In the 1980s, tree shrews were already being used for animal models for Epstein-Barr virus [17] and rotavirus [18] infection.

Control animals were inoculated with an equal volume of uninfected allantoic fluid. We examined all clinical symptoms during the course of infection to characterize the disease caused by virus infection. All tree shrews were observed to be clinically normal signs on day 0. Clinical signs of infection were initially observed on day 1 post-infection (p.i.), with most animals exhibiting signs by day 3 or 4 p.i. and gradually disappeared by day 9 p.i. Clinical signs observed in three infected groups included hypoactivity, and increasing nasopharyngeal secretion (Table 1 ). There was no obvious change in average body weight in animals inoculated with the viruses compared with the control group (Table 1) .We observed slight fevers in all three strains of influenza viruses on day 2 and 3 p.i.

Evidence of acute bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia were observed in the lungs of all tree shrews infected with A/PR8/34 virus (Figure 2A ). Groups of GZ/02/09 and S-OIV/GZ/07/09 showed evidence of interstitial pneumonia, mild bronchiolitis ( Figures 2B and C) . Also, extensive interstitial edema and hyperemia were characterized in all virus challenge groups (Figures 2A, B , and C). Moreover, pathological change in trachea of GZ/02/09 group exhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells ( Figure 2E ). In comparison, the tracheal and lung tissue from a control tree shrew had no apparent histological changes ( Figure 2D and F). Nasal washes from the tree shrews were collected on days 1,2,4,6 and 9 p.i. and subjected to TCID 50 and qPCR assays. The data showed that tested viruses grew to peak titers on day 1 or day2 p.i., with infectious virus titres ranging from 10 4.24 to 10 2.94 TCID 50 /ml, and dropped to undetectable levels by day 4 p.i. using TCID 50 assay ( Figure 3 ). This viral growth kinetics was consistent with that observed from outcome of qPCR assay for each strain tested ( Figure 3 ). However viral shedding ended by around day 4 to 9 p.i., probably due to superior sensitivity of qPCR assay. The titer of S-OIV/GZ/07/09 was highest among all strains tested. Moreover, we detected infectious virus in homogenate of nasal mucosa with logTCID50/mL value ranging from 1.89 to 2.17, while no virus was found in trachea and lung (Table 1) .

In the nasal mucosa, SA \u03b12,6 Gal receptors were widely expressed on the squamous epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and the epithelial cells of the gland, only a few SA\u03b12,3 Gal receptor were detected on squamous epithelial cells, (Figure 4A , B). The SA \u03b12,6 Gal receptor was mostly detected in the pseudostratified ciliated cells of the trachea, whereas only a few SA\u03b12,3 Gal were found in the same area ( Figure 4D ,E). In the mixed glands of the submucosa layer, both receptors in endothelial cells of blood vessels were detected ( Figure 4D ,E). In lung tissue, the non-ciliated cuboidal epithelium of the terminal bron-chioles mainly expressed SA\u03b12,6 Gal ( Figure 4G ), whereas alveolar epithelial cells mainly expressed SA\u03b12,3 Gal, and alveolar macrophages also expressed SA\u03b12,3 Gal ( Figure 4H ). Treatment with neuraminidase prior to lectin staining resulted in absence of staining and thus confirmed the specificity for both SNA and MAA II ( Figure 4C ,F,I). The distribution of SA\u03b12,6 Gal was mainly detected in the trachea and bronchus and to a lesser degree in the alveolar cells. In contrast, SA\u03b12,3Gal receptor was more regularly observed in respiratory bronchiolar and lung alveolar cells, and only sporadic expression of SA\u03b12,3Gal was observed in the tracheal, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells.",

Although sneezing occurred occasionally, it was more frequently associated with the common cold than with influenza. Tree shrews usually had fever after inoculation with high challenge dose of influenza virus, and dropped to undetectable levels by around one week, which was similar to human infection timeline [1] . Because both of systemic and respiratory symptoms were characteristically observed in tree shrews infected, indeed the symptomatology found in tree shrews was partly similar to human influenza infections without complication [1] . Additionally, the disease manifestations of influenza virus infection in tree shrews also partly resembled those in an excellent mammalian animal model (eg. ferret) [7] . However, loss appetite, congested eyes and otologic manifestation were not observed in tree shrews, but in ferrets [33, 34] . The mouse model can manifest no obvious clinical signs of influenza-like illness, but develop severe pneumonia. Thus far, the tree shrews seem not superior to the ferret model, but have the advantage over the rodent model in the clinical similarity. The serological data showed that tree shrews readily seroconvert in response to intranasal inoculation of virus, and serum neutralizing antibody titers of infected animals range from 80 to 640. Con-sidering the clinical symptoms and antibody immune response observed in tree shrews, it is reasonable to presume this model is potential to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral agents and vaccine for the prevention of influenza infection. However, the tree shrew infected with human influenza model didn't result in lethality, thereby detection of increasing nasal wash titers can serve as endpoints for determination of vaccine efficacy.",

Histopathological analysis indicated that clinical isolate influenza H1N1 virus infection caused exudative and interstitial pneumonia, moderate bronchitis, mild bronchiolitis, interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltrates, which showed considerable similarities to influenza virus pneumonia in human [35] and this also suggested that damage to the ciliated epithelium may be caused by the inflammatory response.",

The hemagglutinin of influenza viruses initiates infection by binding sialic acid (SA) that is bound to glycans through SA \u03b12,3 Gal or SA\u03b12,6 Gal linkage [37] . Therefore, the lectinhistochemistry data are important to evaluate the tree shrew as a model for influenza virus. We established that both human influenza (SA a2,6-Gal, SNA) and avian (SA a2,3-Gal, MAA II specific) receptor types were present in tree shrew respiratory tract, with each tissue showing distinctive anatomical distribution of the two receptors. This suggested that the respiratory tracts may be permissive to viral entry or infection. In tree shrews, the SA \u03b12,6 Gal receptor that is more frequently associated with human influenza viruses was restricted primarily to the trachea and some bronchus, whereas the SA\u03b12,3 Gal receptor preferentially bound by avian viruses was more abundantly present in the pulmonary alveoli and respiratory epithelium, which was similar to humans and ferrets [36, 37] . Considering the anatomical receptor distribution in upper and lower respiratory tract in tree shrew, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the tree shrew can be infected with human influenza viruses, but also potentially be infected with high pathogenic avian influenza virus, even resulting in a lethal pneumonia model.

However, tree shrews, used as experimental animals, need a suitable source for this study. Many countries now carry out laboratory research on tree shrews, such as in the German Primate Center [38] , and tree shrews have also been bred successfully. In China, Kunming Medical University has already achieved local standards for experimental tree shrews, which provides comprehensive quality assurance for artificial propagation and experimental studies of tree shrews [39, 40] . In addition, although ferret is possibly the best model for influenza in humans, the use of this species for routine research purposes is prohibitively expensive [12, 37] . However, compared to ferrets, tree shrews can be bred more easily and are relatively inexpensive to maintain for study.",

The main advantages of tree shrews as an experimental model are phylogenetically close to primates [41] , susceptible to influenza without prior adaptation, small size, low expense and husbandry, which make the model more accessible to the researchers. Although the tree shrews mimic well the disease in humans, the absence of severe infection and possible differences in drug pharmacokinetics in tree shrews and humans may limit the study of antiviral treatment. Further efforts are needed to determine its pathogenesis in tree shrew model such as viral replication in the extra pulmonary organs as well as its application of assessments of antiviral agents and vaccine. To this end, the tree shrew model will be useful for assessment of circulating strains that could challenge human public health.",

To evaluate the ability of different viral strains to replicate in tree shrews,~10 5 TCID 50 was administered to each animal intranasally in each group of six tree shrews; three control animals were inoculated with an equal volume of uninfected allantoic fluid. Clinical signs of infection and bodyweight and temperature were recorded daily. In order to measure their body temperatures accurately, animals were quiet after 10 min when captured. To detect viral titer in respiratory tracts, three animals in each group were euthanized at day 2 p.i.. Samples of nasal mucosa, trachea and all lobes of the lung were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The tissues were weighed and subsequently homogenized to make a 10% weight by volume (w/v) suspension for virus titration on MDCK cells using TCID 50 assay. Nasal wash samples containing 0.3 mL PBS with antibiotic were collected from all tree shrews on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 for viral titer determination using the TCID 50 assay. Also, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection of virus in nasal wash samples by use of an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500 system,as described [44] . Nasal wash samples were made into aliquots and placed on dry ice immediately after collection. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.
