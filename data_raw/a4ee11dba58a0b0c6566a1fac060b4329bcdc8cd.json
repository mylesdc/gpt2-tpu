Although the sensitivity of different types of upper respiratory tract samples seems to be correlated to the number of sampled cells, this link remains largely unexplored. Methods: Our study included 800 upper respiratory tract specimens of which 400 negative and 400 positive for viral detection in multiplex PCR. All samples were selected and matched for age in these 2 groups. For the positive group, samples were selected for the detected viral species. Results: Among the factors influencing the cellularity were the type of sample (p < 0.0001); patient age (p < 0.001); viral positive or negative nature of the sample (p = 0.002); and, for the positive samples, the number of viral targets detected (0.004 < p < 0.049) and viral species. Conclusion: The cellular load of upper respiratory samples is multifactorial and occurs for many in the sensitivity of molecular detection. However it was not possible to determine a minimum cellularity threshold allowing molecular viral detection. The differences according to the type of virus remain to be studied on a larger scale.",

Cell quantification standard (QS1: 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/PCR and QS2: 5 \u00d7 10 3 cells/PCR) was ready to use in the kit. An external standard curve was performed using these two standards and 2 additional dilutions, respectively containing 5 \u00d7 10 2 and 50 cells/PCR. The reading of the results was carried out directly from the PLC software, which displays the Ct values (cycle threshold) obtained and the corresponding number of cells/PCR-reaction (i.e. 10 \u03bcl of extract). This number was converted to \"cells/ml\" and the final results were expressed in logarithmic scale (log10/ml). The quantification kit performances were verified in our laboratory by quantifying MRC5 cells (human embryonic fibroblasts) of known concentration (RD-Biothech, Besancon, France). A range of 11 2-fold serial dilutions was made from initial MRC5 cell suspension in viral transport medium (UTM). The nucleic acids were extracted from these 12 cell suspensions, and cell quantification reaction was carried out under the same conditions as for the respiratory samples.",

We have very powerful molecular tools, ensuring a quality respiratory viral diagnosis, available for all clinicians supporting hospitalized patients. One factor limiting this diagnosis is represented by the collected respiratory specimens. The main objectives of this work have been to study the cellularity of these clinical respiratory specimens, to propose a possible definition of what is commonly called \"cellular richness,\" and to measure the impact of this marker on the molecular viral diagnosis. Very few published studies have been completed in this area. However, a number of facts are commonly accepted within the medical community: respiratory specimen should be \"rich\" to allow for \"good\" viral diagnosis, the \"good\" samples are obtained almost exclusively in infants and children. In total we identified 7 studies published in international journals between 2003 and 2014, whose objective was to compare the various upper respiratory samples, in terms of sampling equipment (flocked swabs versus rayon swab), in terms of sampling site (nasal, oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, combining sites), and sampling modality (swab, wash, aspiration) [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The number of target cells and/or the number of extracellular viral particles collected could define the respiratory sample quality during sampling. It is not unreasonable to consider that the majority of the viral sequences detected by molecular techniques are mainly located in the intracellular compartment. However, several factors could modulate this distribution: the viral species, the cytopathic effect induced in vivo, the inflammatory responses, and the sampling delay from the onset of the symptoms. This study is retrospective; it was therefore not possible to collect data from the time between sampling and clinical symptoms in a standardized way. This matter is nonetheless very interesting and remains to be explored. For this study, we considered cell quantification, or cellular richness, as the main marker of diagnostic efficacy for a sample.",

We therefore used previously characterized and stored frozen (-80\u00b0C) respiratory samples. The definition of cellular richness is not affected by freezing or thawing samples since it theoretically does not change the amount of HPRT1 nucleic acid, i.e. 2 copy per haploid cell, whether or not lysed.

We have clearly demonstrated that nasal aspirates allowed us to collect more cells than with nasal swabs and this only in the age group under 15 years old. This result must be tempered by the fact that 90 % (173/196) of the nasal aspirations of the study were from children under 9 years of age, since the distribution was random at inclusion of samples in the study. This reflects a common practice of sampling methods in clinical departments: nasal aspirates are rarely performed in adults and the elderly over 65 years old.

The reasons for this lack of cellularity in respiratory samples from Adults remain obscure. Regarding the influence of cellularity on the result of viral detection, it should be noted that negative samples present, all age groups combined, an average cellularity lower than that obtained for the positive samples, even though it has not been possible to establish a predictive relationship. This difference was tenuous for the Children group. This observation leads to two possible explanations: either in the Positive group the infection increases the sample cellularity by promoting epithelial desquamation and, to a lesser extent, the mucus capture, containing free viral particles; or, in the Negative group, there are false-negatives in virus detection, induced by a lack of cells in the sample. This result was obtained from all samples (aspirates and swabs). Insofar as aspirates are evenly distributed in both Positive and Negative groups, we think that the result of comparison is not biased given that aspirates are richer samples. Considering viral detection in its entirety, without analysis of the viral species detected, it is interesting to note that the two factors, \"cellularity\" and \"viral codetection\" (detection of 2 or 3 viruses) are associated positively. This suggests that the detection of several viruses is facilitated in the context of a rich sample. In cases of viral co-detection, the question of whether these are the same cells that are infected or not is not resolved, even if it is conventionally accepted that an already infected cell is less permissive to a second viral infection. It should also be noted that viral co-detection can be either a co-infection, or two or more sequential infections.",
