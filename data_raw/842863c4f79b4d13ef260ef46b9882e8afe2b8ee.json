            "text": "Current technologies for targeted characterization and manipulation of viral RNA primarily involve amplification or ultracentrifugation with isopycnic gradients of viral particles to decrease host RNA background. The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. To address this, we developed a novel application of current nucleic acid hybridization technologies for direct characterization of RNA. In particular, we modified a current enrichment protocol to capture whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays to circumvent the abovementioned problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. RT-qPCR was used as the primary proof of concept that capture-based purification indeed removes host background. Subsequently, capture-based purification was applied to direct RNA sequencing as proof of concept that capture-based purification can be coupled with downstream RNA assays. We report that this protocol was able to successfully purify viral RNA by 561-to 791-fold. We also report that application of this protocol to direct RNA sequencing yielded a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580-fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15\u00d7 coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120\u00d7. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-based purification method for assays that involve direct manipulation or characterisation of native RNA. This report also describes a successful application of capture-based purification as a direct RNA sequencing strategy that addresses certain limitations of current strategies in sequencing RNA viral genomes. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

            "text": "To deal with this issue, two main strategies are employed. Firstly, extracted viral RNA can be reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to suit the sensitivities of the downstream assays (Ozsolak and Milos 2011) . Following conversion to cDNA and amplification, in vitro transcription is then performed to retrieve genetic information in its RNA form, since both RNA-RNA interactions and RNA intramolecular structure can only be observed whilst in this form (Peattie 1979) . Indeed, both Romero-L\u00f3pez and Berzal-Herranz (2009) and Witteveldt et al. (2014) amplified viral RNA obtained from cell culture via PCR amplification of viral cDNA clones followed by in vitro transcription. It has been shown, however, that such indirect methods for probing inherent properties of RNA increases experimental throughput at the expense of introducing PCR-induced artifacts and biases (Acinas et al. 2005) , potentially clouding our understanding of these properties (Ozsolak et al. 2009 ). Secondly, isopycnic ultracentrifugation can be used to retrieve high purity samples of viral particles containing viral RNA, which can be subsequently extracted for downstream RNA assays. One example is the use of a sucrose density gradient to purify DENV2 RNA for RNA tertiary structure analysis (Dethoff et al. 2018) . While the use of isopycnic centrifugation allows for a high purity of viral RNA, only RNA from encapsulated viruses are obtained (Liu et al. 2011) , making this technique unfeasible for the study of unassembled viral genomes, which have also been shown to be crucial to our understanding of viral replication machinery (Manokaran et al. 2015; Moon et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "With the advent of 3rd generation nanopore sequencing, direct RNA sequencing of native RNA strands is heralded as a PCR and cDNA-bias free sequencing technology (Garalde et al. 2018) . However, the direct RNA sequencing of RNA viral genomes is similarly affected by high amounts of host RNA background in viral cultures. The only method to date which addresses this issue is the use of custom sequencing adapters which has been demonstrated to yield high sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. Keller et al. (2018) utilized a custom sequencing adapter complimentary to the 3\u2032 end of influenza A viral genome to selectively sequence only the viral RNA. However, this strategy is unviable for samples with diverse viral strains or genotypes where the 3\u2032 sequence is unknown or non-conserved. An appropriate example is the wide diversity in hepatitis C virus genotypes, which has caused issues in PCR primer design for target enrichment strategies due to sequence ambiguity (Thomson et al. 2016) . Similarly, Cowan et al. (2005) noted that PCR-based enrichment techniques where a priori knowledge of target sequences is required for PCR primer design render the enrichment strategies ineffective in the characterization of novel viruses. It follows that the same sequence ambiguity in viral genomes would pose a problem for using customized sequencing adapters during direct RNA sequencing.",

This novel method is able to isolate native viral RNA molecules from a high host RNA background without the use of PCR amplification or cDNA synthesis whilst retaining genetic information. Our capture-based purification method is distinguished from conventional hybridization-based or PCR-based enrichment techniques explored in the review paper by Mamanova et al.

This was corroborated by our direct RNA sequencing results. Indeed, unpurified viral RNA represented by the pre-capture group did not produce sufficient throughput for any meaningful downstream analysis due to the indiscriminate nature of the sequencing of both host and viral RNA. However, after treatment with our capture method, the amount of host RNA background has decreased greatly as seen from the 272-fold increase in mapping rates to target viral RNA. In comparison, even with the incorporation of PCR amplification for shotgun sequencing of enterovirus, Jensen et al. (2015) reported only a 2-to 13-fold increase in mapping rates to enterovirus. Moreover, Wongsurawat et al. (2019) observed only a 36-fold increase in mapping rates to Zika virus (ZIKV). This suggests that our capture-based purification method is highly successful in the removal of host RNA background. The minimum coverage required for variant calling was, as described above, benchmarked to that of Illumina reads so that the effectiveness of our capture-based purification method could be more accurately evaluated based on the higher error read rates of direct RNA sequencing technology.

The robustness of this capture-based purification method therefore not only broadens the applicability of direct RNA sequencing on studying unknown viruses but also the applicability of a diverse range of direct RNA probing technologies. Another major advantage to our capture-based purification method is that large machinery like an ultracentrifuge is not required. To perform our capture method, only a thermocycler and a heat block is required. This is especially applicable to research environments where an ultracentrifuge is not readily available. More fundamentally, our capture-based purification method allows for the capture of both unassembled and assembled viruses, which any method leveraging on the differential physiochemical properties of encapsulated viral RNAs cannot. This would be important in studies of unassembled RNA segments, which have been demonstrated to be of great biological importance. Indeed, in the case of DENV1, subgenomic flaviviral particles have been shown to underlie mosquito immunity and viral transmission (Pompon et al. 2017) . If so, a method which can remove host background and capture unassembled viruses would be useful for characterising inherent RNA properties of unassembled viruses.",

While there is a significant loss of viral RNA post capture, we also note that our capture method is scalable. Multiple captures can be performed and purified RNA pooled together before re-concentrating in the final bead clean-up step. The concentrated post-capture group was a demonstration of how our capture-based purification method was appropriately scaled to suit the sensitivity of direct RNA sequencing. Indeed, after comparison of the postcapture and concentrated post-capture sequencing runs (Table 2) , the 2.5-fold increase in the percentage of reads mapping to DENV1 suggests that scaling our method greatly improved the signal-to-noise ratio of this particular downstream RNA assay. While it was opined that this improvement would similarly be observed in other downstream RNA assays, further experimental verification is required.",

Currently, four strategies may be employed for direct RNA sequencing of RNA viruses. Firstly, as described by Keller et al. (2018) , a custom adapter can be used during library preparation. The second strategy is the use of the conventional poly(T) adapter supplied in the kit by polyadenylation of RNA prior to library preparation and sequencing.

This strategy allows sequencing of RNA viruses with or without an inherent poly(A) tail since the conventional poly(T) adapter was substituted with a custom sequencing adapter specific to the target. However, one drawback of this strategy is that foreknowledge of the 3\u2032 end of RNA targets is required. This entails that sequencing of unknown, novel, or mutant viruses would be difficult. Another limitation is that this strategy may be ineffective in cases where the RNA sample is fragmented since the 3\u2032 end of each fragment of viral RNA is distinct.",

Indeed, foreknowledge of target 3\u2032 sequences is still required. On the other hand, attempts at using multiple adapters at different locations on the target genome cannot address the problem of RNA fragmentation. Custom adapters must be specific to the 3\u2032 end of each fragment for ligation. In most laboratory samples, however, RNA is stochastically fragmented.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the second and third strategies, which make use of the conventional poly(T) adapter. This was done using DENV1, a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail. The protocol used to generate the pre-capture group sequencing results employ the second strategy while that for the post-capture and concentrated post-capture results employ the third. The polyadenylation of RNA and subsequent use of the conventional poly(T) adapter has several advantages. First, the polyadenylation of RNA prior to library preparation and sequencing allows for sequencing of RNA viruses with or without an inherent poly(A) tail. Second, usage of the conventional poly(T) adapter removes the need for any foreknowledge of the target sequence. Third, all RNA fragments would be ligated with adapters since the adapters are not sequence specific, circumventing the problem of fragmented RNA. However, the main disadvantage strategies involving polyadenylation of RNA is that sequencing specificity is greatly reduced as host mRNA transcripts include a poly(A) tail and will also be sequenced. Wongsurawat et al. (2019) independently replicated our pre-capture group results but with ZIKV, which is also a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail in the family Flaviviridae. The authors observed 0.11% of reads mapping to ZIKV, which corroborates the low 0.63% of reads mapping to DENV1 in our pre-capture sequencing run. The authors also reported 3.89% of reads mapping to ZIKV whilst employing the fourth strategy. The low percentage of target reads underscores this main disadvantage of sequencing specificity. The issue of low sequencing specificity is, however, less pronounced in the third strategy. Comparing the second strategy (pre-capture) and third strategy (post-capture), there is a 50-fold increase in percentage of reads mapping to DENV1. Furthermore, a comparison of pre-capture and concentrated post-capture results yields a 123-fold increase in mapping rates to DENV1. This suggests that while simply polyadenylating RNA samples leads to low sequencing specificity, applying our capture-based purification prior allows us to reap the advantages of using the conventional poly(T) adapter whilst having a significantly higher sequence specificity. Additionally, coupling capture-based purification with polyadenylation yields a higher target mapping rate of 31.31% with regard to the 3.98% observed when the fourth strategy was employed (Wongsurawat et al. 2019) . This suggests that the third strategy is superior with respect to sequencing specificity when compared to the fourth strategy. It is noted, however, that the sequencing specificity of the third strategy was still lower than that of the first strategy. Moreover, applying capture-based purification in the third strategy significantly increases the turnaround time as compared to the first, second and fourth strategy. Therefore, it is suggested that the third strategy should only be employed where foreknowledge of the viral sequence at hand is limited, or where RNA integrity is low. It is also suggested that the second and fourth strategy be used in cases where detection rather than characterisation of RNA viruses is required due to significantly lower sequencing specificity.",
