In particular, Cs 2 K 4 Na[SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ].H 2 O 1 shows low toxicity and high activity against HBV. The preclinical pharmacokinetics of Compound 1 in rats were characterized by establishing and applying inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry method to determine the concentration of W in plasma, urine, feces, bile and organ samples. The quantitative ICP-MS method demonstrated good sensitivity and application in the pharmacokinetics study of polyoxometalates. The pharmacokinetic behavior of Compound 1 after intravenous or oral administration fit a two-compartment model. T max ranges from 0.1 h to 3 h and the T 1/2 of Compound 1 is between 20 h and 30 h. The absolute bioavailability of Compound 1 at 45, 180 and 720 mg/kg groups were 23.68%, 14.67% and 11.93%, respectively. The rates of plasma protein binding of Compound 1 at 9, 18 and 36 mg/ml of Compound 1 are 62.1369.41%, 71.20624.98% and 49.00625.59%, respectively. Compound 1 was widely distributed throughout the body, and high levels of compound 1 were found in the kidney and liver. The level of Compound 1 in excretion was lower: 30% for urine, 0.28% for feces and 0.42% for bile, respectively. For elaborate pharmacokinetic characteristics to be fully understood, the metabolism of Compound 1 needs to be studied further.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is chronic and difficult to cure, clinical treatment, continues to be a major public health problem. In China, the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier rate accounts for 9.8 percent of the population, and one third of the worldwide carrier [1] . HBV is the prototype of hepadnaviridae, a family of small, enveloped hepatotropic DNA viruses that can infect the liver of humans [2] . Infection by the virus results in a series of clinical symptoms ranging from minor flu-like symptoms to acute, fulminant or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver carcinoma, and can even result in death [3] . HBV is estimated to be responsible for 500,000-700,000 deaths each year [4] . There are a number of drugs available to treat hepatitis B viral infection, including interferon (IFN), Thymosin a (Ta), famciclovir (FCV), adefovir (ADV), lamivudine (LAM) et al. However, none of these therapies are completely safe and effective, and clinical exploration of promising antiviral agents like nucleoside analogues is hampered by their significant side effects, especially the development of resistant viruses [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, it is crucial to explore the safer, more efficacious and less expensive anti-HBV agents.",

These complexes are versatile and can be used in catalytic processes [8] , magnetic materials [9] , nanotechnology [10] and medical procedures. Several POMs are especially useful in medicinal chemistry, serving as new kinds of inorganic medicinal candidates that possess antiviral, antitumor, and antibiotic activities [11] [12] [13] [14] . Because of their extremely small (sub 5 nm) dimensions, they exhibit low toxicity, are stable in biological media, are liable to be cleared by the renal system, and can be engineered for various applications, especially as antiviral agents [15] . POMs have been widely researched in recent years, and they have been proven to be active against a wide range of viruses, including both RNA viruses and DNA viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency RNA virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome RNA virus (SARS), influenza RNA virus and herpes simplex DNA virus (HSV) [16] [17] [18] [19] . The mechanism of antiviral action may occur through the prevention of viral adsorption and penetration by inhibiting the activity of retroviridase [20] [21] [22] . The advantage of POMs in antiviral activity inspired us to find effective anti-HBV drug candidates in this field.",

Polyoxometalates, as non-nucleoside analogs, have been proven to exhibit broad inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus and SARS virus [27] . In our previous study, the treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with Compound 1 effectively suppressed the secretion of HBV antigens and HBV DNA. [24] Therefore, the pharmacokinetics study of Compound 1 is critical to fighting viral atntigens.",

The highest deposition at 0.25 h was found in the stomach and intestine, but these concentrations decreased as time passed, which indicates that the main route of absorption is through the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to the gastrointestinal tract, Compound 1 also deposits in the liver, kidney, lungs and spleen, which have more blood flow. In contrast, Compound 1 deposits less in fat and skeletal muscle, which have little blood. The low concentration of Compound 1 in the testis, epididymis, ovary and uterus is consistent with the results in reproductive toxicity experiments, which found no obvious reproductive toxicity of Compound 1 [28] . Much lower contents in the heart suggest that the cardiovascular system is not prone to being impaired by Compound 1. Less deposition was found in the brain, suggesting that Compound 1 cannot go through the blood brain barrier easily. The content of Compound 1 in the kidney and liver was as high as 10-70 times the content in the other tissues, which implied that kidney and liver were the main metabolism and elimination positions, and that they may the possible toxic sites. The high content in liver is also in favor of the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The clearance from tissues is rather quick; the content in tissues is less than 10% of the peak content at 96 h.",

The results indicate that most of Compound 1 exists in a combined form with plasma protein in systemic circulation; however, the binding force may be weak, and therefore it is likely to be out-competed by other high-binding drugs. The accumulative excretion results indicated that the main route of excretion of Compound 1 was through feces, which contained about 30% of the drug tested, while urine contained about 0.28% and bile contained about 0.42%. At 72 h, approximately 31.1% of the total amount of administered Compound 1 had been excreted. The results also indicated that Compound 1 can be easily accumulated in vivo, so the further study of Compound 1 and metabolites from excretion is also essential.",
