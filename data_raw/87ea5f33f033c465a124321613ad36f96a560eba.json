However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-\u03b3 following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality. These results demonstrate that in contrast to other respiratory viruses, RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can induce lethal immunopathology despite mediating enhanced viral clearance.",

There is currently no licensed vaccine for RSV. During a primary RSV infection, the CD8 T cell response is crucial for mediating viral clearance [12, 13] . Depletion of CD8 T cells in mice prior to RSV challenge leads to elevated viral loads, but also ameliorates morbidity [12] . Thus, CD8 T cells contribute to both viral clearance and immunopathology following an acute RSV infection. RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells also contribute to protection from a secondary infection [12] . Antibody-mediated depletion of memory CD8 T cells in RSVimmune mice impairs viral clearance following re-infection as compared to non-treated controls [12] . Thus, vaccines that elicit robust memory CD8 T cell responses may help promote long-lived immunity against RSV.",

In contrast, studies have demonstrated that robust memory CD4 T cell responses can mediate vaccine-enhanced disease following RSV infection [18, 19] . Adoptive transfer of activated effector RSV-specific CD8 T cells, in vitro stimulated T cell lines, or in vitro propagated T cell clones leads to enhanced RSV clearance from the lung following RSV challenge. These effector CD8 T cell transfers were also associated with increased weight loss, indicating that infusion of effector CD8 T cells can induce increased systemic disease [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, the role of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against RSV infection remains unclear. Evaluating the capacity of memory CD8 T cells to mediate protection against RSV infection is critically important because high neutralizing antibody titers alone are insufficient to prevent RSVinduced disease in every individual [14, 24] .",

We employed a dendritic cell-Listeria monocytogenes (DC-LM) prime-boost immunization regimen to induce high magnitude, RSV epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses in naive mice. A similar prime-boost immunization strategy has been shown to elicit protection against other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [25, 26] . DC-LM immunization induced robust memory CD8 T cell responses that reduced viral titers following RSV challenge. However, despite enhanced viral clearance, immunized mice experienced increased pulmonary disease, weight loss, and mortality. Exacerbated disease and mortality was unique to the context of an RSV infection as immunized mice were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of a recombinant IAV expressing an RSVderived CD8 T cell epitope. The lethal immunopathology observed in immunized mice was caused by rapid and excessive IFN-\u03b3 production by memory CD8 T cells in the airways. Our studies reveal that memory CD8 T cells enhance RSV clearance similar to other viral infections, but are unique in that they mediate severe immunopathology caused by the overproduction of IFN-\u03b3.",

A control group without RSV-specific CD8 T cell memory was generated by immunizing mice with DCs not exposed to peptide followed by a boost with an LM that did not express an RSV-derived epitope. DC-LM immunization led to a significant (p<0.001) increase in M2 82 -specific CD8 T cell frequencies following the LM booster inoculation within the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) compartment as compared to the control group ( Fig  1A) . Approximately 20% of all CD8 T cells in the PBL were M2 82 -specific at day 42 post-boost ( Fig 1A) . Immunized mice challenged with RSV exhibited a significant (p<0.001) reduction in lung viral titers by day 4 post-infection (p.i.) compared to the control group undergoing a primary RSV infection ( Fig 1B) . As expected, immunized mice exhibited an increased number of total and M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells in the lung by day 5 p.i. as compared to non-infected M2 82 -immunized controls (Fig 1C and 1D ).

Approximately 40% of fatalities were due to M2 82 -immunized mice naturally succumbing to RSV infection, while 60% were euthanized upon reaching a humane weight loss endpoint. This outcome was both unexpected and unusual since an acute RSV infection is rarely fatal in adult BALB/c mice. M2 82 -immunized mice also exhibited significantly (p<0.05) increased weight loss ( Fig 2B) and reduced pulmonary function (Fig 2C  Fig 1. DC-LM immunization induces robust memory CD8 T cell responses that mediate clearance following RSV infection. Naive BALB/c mice were primed with mature DCs coated in M2 82 peptide and boosted 7 days later with recombinant LM expressing the M2 82 epitope. Control mice received mature DCs not coated in peptide and were inoculated with LM that did not express an RSV-derived epitope. (A) M2 82 -tetramer + CD8 T cell response was assessed in the PBL following DC-LM prime-boost immunization. (B) RSV titers at day 4 p.i. were determined via plaque assay in the lung.

Additionally, we evaluated lungs by histology for evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), an acute form of lung injury [30, 31] . If severe and extensive enough, DAD is the foundational lesion in the clinical syndrome known as acute respiratory distress syndrome. M2 82immunized mice revealed increased (p<0.001) histopathological evidence of characteristics associated with early stages of DAD including cellular sloughing and necrosis, alveolar hemorrhage, early cellular infiltrates, and hyaline membrane formation (Fig 2E and 2F and S2 and S3 Figs) .",

            "text": "Previous work has demonstrated that the M2 82 -specific CD8 T cell response contributes to the immunopathology associated with an acute RSV infection [32] . Thus, it was unclear if the increased disease severity observed in M2 82 -immunized mice was unique to the M2 82-90 epitope. To address this possibility, we evaluated mice immunized against the F 85-93 (F 85 ) CD8 T cell epitope following RSV infection [33] . Similar to M2 82 -immunized mice, F 85 DC-LM immunization induced a high frequency of RSV F 85 -specific memory CD8 T cells that mediated a decrease in lung viral titers at day 4 following RSV challenge (S4A and S4B Fig) . In addition, F 85 -immunized mice exhibited increased mortality, weight loss, and pulmonary dysfunction as compared to controls (S4C- S4F Fig) . Thus, the severe immunopathology induced by memory CD8 T cells was not specific to either a particular epitope or an RSV protein. We next determined if RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells would also cause increased disease in C57BL/6 mice, as an acute RSV infection in this mouse strain typically causes only mild disease [34] . Therefore, we immunized C57BL/6 mice against the immunodominant M 187-195 (M 187 ) CD8 T cell epitope [35] . DC-LM immunization targeting the M 187 epitope resulted in approximately 33% M 187 -specific CD8 T cells in the PBL by day 28 post-boost (S5A Fig) . Similar to M 82 -immunized BALB/c mice, M 187 -immunized C57BL/6 mice exhibited significantly reduced lung virus titers (p<0.001), decreased pulmonary function, and increased weight loss following RSV infection (S5B- S5E Fig) . However, in contrast to M2 82 -immunized BALB/c mice, all of the M 187 -immunized C57BL/6 mice survived following RSV infection. This data indicates that M 187 -specific CD8 T cells also contribute to immunopathogenic responses in the C57BL/6 genetic background.",

Slutter et al. recently used a similar DC-LM prime-boost strategy to elicit IAV-specific memory CD8 T cells and demonstrated protection against a subsequent IAV infection [25] . Similar to RSV challenge, immunized mice infected with IAV-M2 82 exhibited a significant increase in the number of total and M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells in the lung by day CD4 T cell, Treg, neutrophil, and NK cell numbers were not significantly altered in IAV-M2 82 challenged mice (S7 Fig). As anticipated, all control mice, which do not have virus-specific memory CD8 T cells, succumbed to a lethal IAV-M2 82 challenge. However, in contrast to the significant (p<0.001) mortality observed in M2 82 -immunized mice following RSV challenge, M2 82 -immunized mice were protected against a lethal IAV-M2 82 infection ( Fig 3A) . Pre-existing M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells also prevented the prolonged weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction observed in control mice following IAV-M2 82 infection (Fig 3B-3D) . Furthermore, weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction following RSV challenge were significantly (p<0.05) increased at early timepoints compared to IAV-M2 82 infected mice ( Fig  3B-3D ). In addition, M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells induced a significant (p<0.001) reduction in IAV titers at both day 4 and day 6 p.i. (Fig 3E) . These data indicate that pre-existing RSV M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells mediate enhanced IAV-M2 82 clearance and promote increased survival of mice by preventing prolonged disease. To confirm that memory CD8 T cells would also provide protection without extensive immunopathology to a lower viral inoculum, we challenged M2 82 -immunized mice with a sublethal dose of IAV-M2 82 . Similar to a lethal dose of IAV-M2 82 , M2 82 -immunized mice experienced significantly (p<0.05) improved pulmonary function and less weight loss as compared to the control group following a sublethal infection (S8 Fig) . Thus, memory CD8 T cells do not promote distinct patterns of disease severity between sublethal and lethal IAV infections. These results indicate that lethal immunopathology associated with a high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell response is unique to the context of an RSV infection.",

To evaluate the effects of local immunization, DC-M2 82 -primed mice were either not boosted, given a systemic LM-M2 82 boost intravenously (i.v.), or given a local IAV-M2 82 boost intransally (i.n.). Administration of an IAV-M2 82 boost induced a significant (p<0.001) increase in the total number of M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to RSV challenge as compared to a systemic LM-M2 82 boost (S9A and S9B Fig) . We next utilized intravascular staining to determine the localization of cells within the lung following immunization [37, 38] . The majority of M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells in the lung of DC-M2 82primed mice that were either not boosted or boosted systemically with LM-M2 82 were located within the pulmonary vasculature (S9C Fig). In contrast, greater than 85% of M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells were localized within the lung tissue in IAV-M2 82 -boosted mice, resulting in a significant (p<0.001) increase in total number as compared to LM-M2 82 -boosted mice (S9C and S9D Fig) . In addition, local boost in the lung with IAV-M2 82 induced a large frequency of RSV-specific CD8 T cells within the lung tissue expressing both CD69 and CD103, which represent the canonical markers of resident memory CD8 T cells. In contrast, systemic LM-M2 82 immunization failed to elicit resident memory CD8 T cells within the lung tissue (S9E and S9F Fig) .",

Leukocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 in vivo were readily identified using this previously established method (S14A Fig). Upon evaluation of the primary leukocyte populations present in the lung following RSV infection, only lymphocytes had produced IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice at day 2 p.i. (Fig 4C) . Only a small frequency of CD4 T cells and NK cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were observed at day 2 p.i., whereas approximately 45% of CD8 T cells were producing IFN-\u03b3 ( Fig 4C) . These data also correlate with the rapid and transient increase in the amount of IFN-\u03b3 protein we observed in the lung and serum at day 2 p.i., as virtually no IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were recovered on day 5 p.i. (S14B Fig). The IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD8 T cells were largely CD11a hi , indicating that the majority were antigen-experienced T cells ( Fig  4D) [44] . When comparing M2 82 -specific T lymphocytes to all other CD8 T cells in the lung at day 2 p.i., half of M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3, whereas almost 30% of the remaining CD8 T cells were also producing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 4E) . These results indicate that both M2 82 -specific and bystander antigen-experienced CD8 T cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice early following RSV infection. Lastly, we assessed IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells in the respiratory tract (lung and BAL), mediastinal lymph node (mLN), and periphery (spleen and PBL). The majority of CD8 T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were localized to the lung and BAL ( Fig  4F) . In contrast, a relatively low frequency of CD8 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 in the spleen and PBL, and virtually no IFN-\u03b3 production was observed in the mLN (Fig 4F) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that antigen-experienced CD8 T cells in the airways of immunized mice secrete IFN-\u03b3 early following RSV infection leading to increased IFN-\u03b3 levels in both the lung and the periphery.",

To evaluate the role of IFN-\u03b3, we treated M2 82 -immunized mice with either control IgG or anti-IFN-\u03b3 neutralizing antibody administered i.n at the time of RSV challenge. While high mortality was observed in the IgG-treated group, neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 led to the survival of all immunized mice (Fig 5A) . In addition, weight loss and respiratory dysfunction were significantly (p<0.05) reduced in immunized mice following IFN-\u03b3 neutralization as compared to the IgG-treated mice (Fig 5B-5D ). Neutralization of IFN\u03b3 did not significantly impact virus titers in the lung at day 4 p.i., suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 does not contribute to pathogen clearance in this prime-boost immunization model (Fig 5E) . Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in significantly (p<0.001) decreased TNF levels in the lung at day 2 p.i. compared to IgG-treated controls (Fig 5F) . Overall, our results suggest that antigen-experienced CD8 T cells rapidly secrete IFN-\u03b3, which mediates lethal immunopathology following RSV infection in DC-LM-immunized mice by promoting the production of TNF by other cell populations.",

Our results demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells, in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cell memory or antibodies, promote enhanced viral clearance following RSV challenge.

Memory CD8 T cells are protective and do not exacerbate disease severity with other respiratory viral infections such as IAV or SARS-CoV [25, 26] . Consistent with memory CD8 T cells being able to provide protection against IAV infection [25] , we show that RSV M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells mediate protection following a lethal IAV-M2 82 infection. A systemic increase of IFN-\u03b3 was seen in immunized mice early 2 days following RSV infection. Antigen-experienced CD8 T cells in the airways were the primary source of IFN-\u03b3. The presence of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells only in the airways suggests that production was in response to antigen stimulation given the strong tropism of RSV to the epithelium and alveolar cells of the respiratory tract [47] [48] [49] . Interestingly, peak IFN-\u03b3 production occurred prior to the significant accumulation and/or expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the lung by day 5 p.i. This observation is similar to work by Liu et al. showing IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells prior to expansion of the CD8 T cell response following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection [43] . Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 prevented all mortality and reduced disease severity in immunized mice without impacting RSV titers. These data indicate that IFN-\u03b3 promotes the severe immunopathology, but does not contribute to viral clearance.",

Antibody-mediated neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 does not impact RSV viral titers during an acute infection indicating a minor role in viral clearance [42] . Induction of a Th1-biased immune response is important to prevent the pathology associated with a Th2-skewed response [42, [50] [51] [52] . Nonetheless, IFN-\u03b3 still contributes to minimal immunopathology associated with an acute RSV infection [42, 52] . However, treatment of mice with recombinant IFN-\u03b3 at early timepoints has been shown to protect against lethal IAV infection with no difference in viral clearance [53] . This result is consistent with our study showing that DC-LM immunized mice receiving a lethal IAV infection have significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in the lung at early time points as compared to RSV challenged mice. Together, these results suggest that supplemental IFN-\u03b3 limits the severe pathology associated with a lethal IAV infection without contributing to viral clearance. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 can play distinct roles by either contributing to immunopathology or ameliorating disease dependent upon the respiratory virus infection.",

Immunized mice deficient in perforin exhibited similar disease severity as WT controls following RSV challenge. In addition, all perforin-deficient mice eventually succumbed to infection whereas typically 10-20% of WT immunized mice survive. It has been previously demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 and TNF levels in perforin-deficient mice are elevated following an acute RSV infection, which likely contributes to the accelerated mortality we observed in M2 82 -immunized perforin-deficient mice [42] . A role for regulating CD8 T cell expansion and cytokine production by perforin to prevent mortality has also been demonstrated for secondary CD8 T cell responses against LCMV [54, 55] . Lastly, the neutralization of TNF also improved survival and ameliorated disease in immunized mice following RSV infection. The cytokine TNF is known to contribute to both weight loss and inflammation during acute RSV infection [42] . Therefore, TNF plays a critical role in mediating immunopathology during both primary and secondary RSV infections.",

This disparity in RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell numbers prior to RSV challenge may account for the observed difference in outcome between our studies. It remains controversial whether a strong CD8 T cell response is desirable during RSV infection in humans. Experimental RSV infection of adult humans revealed that greater frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the BAL correlated with reduced clinical disease symptoms [57] .

In adult volunteers experimentally infected with RSV, Jozwik et al. found that a higher baseline frequency of RSVspecific CD8 T cells in the airways correlated with a lower cumulative symptom score following RSV challenge [57] . Our results obtained by administration of a local IAV-M2 82 boost are consistent with this notion. Our data suggest that systemic RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are more prone to causing immunopathology, possibly in part due to their delay in reaching the lungs. However, the use of the human RSV challenge model cannot evaluate the protective capacity of memory CD8 T cells in the absence of RSV-specific memory CD4 T cells and antibodies as we have done here using our animal model. Thus, we believe our results are applicable to humans in cases where vaccination of an RSV seronegative individual would primarily elicit a CD8 T cell response.",

These data highlight how complex and unique the RSV-induced immune response is in contrast to other respiratory viral infections. Our results indicate that epitope-based cellular vaccines against RSV may have detrimental consequences.
