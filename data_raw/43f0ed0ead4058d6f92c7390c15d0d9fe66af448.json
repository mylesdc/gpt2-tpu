It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to central nervous system disorders as well as disordered enteric motility and associated wasting. For almost 40 years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected, but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the disease.",

Ultra high throughput sequencing was utilized to recover the complete viral genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a bornavirus-like genome organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence divergence from all prior bornavirus isolates. We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Further specific ABV PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection rate among PDD cases (71%, n = 7) compared to controls (0%, n = 14) (P = 0.01; Fisher's Exact Test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates we have now recovered from these and an additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups.",

This disease has been documented in multiple continents in over 50 different species of psittacines as well as captive and free-ranging species in at least 5 other orders of birds [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Most, if not all major psittacine collections throughout the world have experienced cases of PDD. It has been particularly devastating in countries like Canada and northern areas of the United States where parrots are housed primarily indoors. However, it is also problematic in warmer regions where birds are typically bred in outdoor aviaries. Moreover, captive breeding efforts for at least one psittacine which is thought to be extinct in the wild, the Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), have been severely impacted by PDD.",

PDD primarily affects the autonomic nerves of the upper and middle digestive tract, including the esophagus, crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and duodenum. Microscopically, the disease is recognized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates within myenteric ganglia and nerves. Similar infiltrates may also be present in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, conductive tissue of the heart, smooth and cardiac muscle, and adrenal glands. Non-suppurative leiomyositis and/or myocarditis may accompany the neural lesions [6] [7] [8] [9] . Clinically, PDD cases present with GI tract dysfunction (dysphagia, regurgitation, and passage of undigested food in feces), neurologic symptoms (e.g. ataxia, abnormal gait, proprioceptive defects), or both [3] . Although the clinical course of the disease can vary, it is generally fatal in untreated animals [3] .",

Evidence for an infectious etiology stems from the initial outbreaks of Macaw Wasting Disease, and other subsequent outbreaks of PDD [2, 10] . Reports of pleomorphic virus-like particles of variable size (30-250 nm) observed in tissues of PDD affected birds [8] led to the proposal that paramyxovirus (PMV) may cause the disease; however, serological data has shown that PDD affected birds lack detectable antibodies against PMV of serotypes 1-4, 6, and 7, as well as against avian herpes viruses, polyomavirus, and avian encephalitis virus [3] . Similarly, a proposed role for equine encephalitis virus in PDD has been ruled out [11] . Enveloped virus-like particles of approximately 80 nm in diameter derived from the feces of affected birds have been shown to produce cytopathic effect in monolayers of macaw embryonic cells [12] , but to date no reports confirming these results or identifying this possible agent have been published. Like-wise, adeno-like viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and reoviruses have also been sporadically documented in tissues or excretions of affected birds [3, 13, 14] yet in each case, follow-up evidence for reproducible isolation specifically from PDD cases or identification of these candidate agents has not been reported. Thus, the etiology of PDD has remained an open question.",

Although experimental transmission of BDV to many species (including chicks [16] ) has been described, there is little information on natural avian infection, and existing BDV isolates are remarkable for their relative sequence homogeneity. The agent reported here, which we designate avian bornavirus (ABV) is highly diverged from all previously identified members of the Bornaviridae family and represents the first fulllength bornavirus genome cloned directly from avian tissue. Subsequent PCR screening for similar ABVs confirmed a detection rate of approximately 70% among PDD cases and none among the controls. Sequence analysis of a single complete genome and all of the additional partial sequences that we have recovered directly from the PDD case specimens suggests that the viruses detected in cases of PDD form a new, genetically diverse clade of the Bornaviridae.",

An additional set of 21 samples derived from upper GI tract specimens (crop, proventriculus or ventriculus) from PDD cases and controls were screened for ABV sequences in a blinded fashion (Materials and Methods). For this analysis, we targeted three regions of the genome: 1) the L gene region of the genome that we used for PCR confirmation of the microarray results, (Figure 2 , PCR probes track), 2) a subregion within the N gene and 3) a subregion within the M gene (Materials and Methods). PCR for glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was performed in parallel with the ABV PCR on all specimens to control for integrity of RNA provided from each specimen. Of the 21 specimens analyzed, 5 were positive for ABV by PCR and confirmed by sequence recovery. Unmasking the clinical status of these samples revealed that 7 of the samples were derived from confirmed PDD cases and 14 samples were derived from PDD controls. Among the PDD cases, we found 71% (5/ 7) to be positive by ABV PCR (Table 3 ). In contrast, all PDD controls were negative by ABV PCR, and positive only for GAPDH mRNA. This PCR analysis provides an independent test of the statistical significance of the association between the presence of ABV and histologically confirmed PDD (P = 0.01, Fisher's Exact Test). Although we do not observe ABV in 100% of PDD cases in this series (see Discussion), our results nonetheless indicate a significant association of ABV with PDD.",

By contrast, the ABV isolates reported here are quite diverged from their mammalian counterparts, and show substantial heterogeneity among themselves. We note with interest that a single earlier report suggesting a potential avian reservoir for borna- viruses has been presented [26] . In that study, RT-PCR based on mammalian BDV sequences was used to recover partial sequences from stool collected near duck ponds where wild waterfowl congregate. However, the resulting sequences shared ca. 98% amino acid sequence homology to the mammalian BDVs, raising the possibility that these putative avian sequences might have resulted from possible environmental or laboratory contamination [15] . Our ABV isolates, which are unequivocally of avian origin, are clearly very different from these sequences; it remains to be seen if other wild birds can indeed harbor BDV-like agents. The expanded sequence diversity of the bornaviruses discovered here should facilitate design of PCR primers that will enable expanded detection of diverse bornaviral types in future epidemiological studies.",

However, despite our success in ABV detection in PDD, we did not observe ABV in every PDD case analyzed. There are several possible explanations for this result. First, we do not know the tissue distribution (tropism) of ABV infection, or how viral copy number may vary at different sites as a function of the stage of the disease. By weighting our sample collection towards clinically overt PDD, we may have biased specimen accrual towards advanced disease. At this stage, where destruction of myenteric ganglial elements is often extensive, loss of infected cells may have contributed to detection difficulties (We note with interest in this context that in one of our case collections from Israel, virus detection occurred preferentially in CNS rather than in GI specimens). There are many precedents for such temporal variation in clinical virology -for example, in chronic hepatitis B viral loads typically decline by several orders of magnitude over the long natural history of the infection [27] . It is also possible that our detection rate may merely reflect suboptimal selection of PCR primers employed for screening; after all, our consensus primer selection was based on sequences we had recovered (L gene consensus primers) or sequence homology between the first fully sequenced ABV genome we recovered and a set of highly related mammalian BDV genome sequences (N and M gene consensus primers). We now recognize that there is substantial sequence variation within the ABVs (see Fig. 3 ); as more sequence diversity is recognized, better choices for more highly conserved primers will become apparent and could impact upon these prevalence estimates.",

The resulting aRNA was next used as input for a modified version of Genomic DNA sample preparation protocol for ultra high-throughput Solexa sequencing (Illumina, Hayward, CA). 400 ng of the input aRNA was reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) using a random nonamer tailed with 19 bp of the Solexa Long (5'-CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNNNNN-3') primer sequence (Illumina, Hayward CA).

To filter reads from our analysis potentially derived from psittacine host tissue, the working set of reads were aligned to a database of all Aves sequences from NCBI (n = 918,511) using ELAND, which tolerates no more than 2 base mismatches, and discards both low quality reads and reads with low sequence complexity.

To identify reads with some homology to Bornaviridae sequences in the resulting set of 322,790 host-filtered reads, we re-implemented the ELAND/iterative blastn analysis strategy (down to \u2265 15 nucleotides identity) using a database of all NCBI BDV sequences (n = 207) augmented by our previously recovered ABV sequences (n = 5).
