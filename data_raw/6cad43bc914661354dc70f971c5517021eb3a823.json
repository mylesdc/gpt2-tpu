LT-ARI was defined as any acute lower respiratory tract infection of sufficient severity to warrant admission to hospital. All types of LT-ARI were included, from bronchiolitis to pneumonia, with or without wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea or respiratory distress. A nasopharyngeal sample (aspirate/wash or swab) was obtained during admission in patients recruited between January 2011 and January 2013. A comparison cohort of 97 UK children admitted with LT-ARI, aged over 1 month, and sick enough to warrant blood tests, was recruited between 2009 and 2012 as part of the Immunopathology of Respiratory Infection Study (IRIS) at St Mary's Hospital, London. These cohorts allowed for comparison of North and South European data from two regions with different climate and healthcare systems, as well as permitting validation of the Spanish findings on coinfection rate,and overall virus frequency. In both cohorts, recruited patients were admitted to PICU or ward. The Spanish cohort study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical ",

No differences in findings were observed in relation to the method used for sample collection (data not shown). Molecular diagnostics identified at least one pathogen in 187 samples. Of these PCR positive samples, 73 had previously yielded negative results using conventional methodology-immunufluorescence assays and/or rapid techniques. Five samples (2.5%) were negative for both PCR and the initial diagnostic work-up. In 12 cases (5.9%) where the referring hospital had established a diagnosis, PCR was negative (RSV, n = 8; IV H1N1, n = 2; Mycoplasma, n = 1; and Influenza C, n = 1). By PCR multiplex assay, a single pathogen was detected in 95 (46.6%) children and two or more pathogens were detected in 92 (45.1%) patients, giving an overall detection rate of 91.7%. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 108), followed by hRV (n = 68), hBoV (n = 48), AdV (n = 39), HMPV (n = 27), IV (n = 12), hPIV and hCoV (both n = 5) ( Table 2 ). In co-infected samples, the most frequent combination of pathogens was RSV + hRV (n = 23) followed by RSV + hBoV (n = 10) and RSV + AdV (n = 7) (see Table 3 ). The virus most frequently found in dual infection was RSV (n = 42), followed by hRV (n = 35) ( Table 2) . RSV was observed with the same frequency as a single infection (n = 53) and as a co-infection agent (n = 55) (see Fig 1) . However, hRV, IV, hBoV, AdV and hMPV were more frequently found in co-infections (Fig 1) .",

We observed that co-infection rates were lower in older children in both cohorts, despite this group being prone to greater LT-ARI exposure through increased participation in shared childcare groups. This finding is inconsistent with two previous reports. In particular, Chorazy et al. [23] reported a non-significant increase in co-infection in children aged 6-12 months, and co-infection decreased after one year with increasing age. Peng et al.

            "text": "In young children, hMPV is an important cause of bronchiolitis, accounting for 5-15% of all cases [4, 41, 42] . In our study we found 27 (13.2%) hMPV-positive samples in the GENDRES cohort. Of these, 66.7% of hMPV were detected as a co-infection with another respiratory virus, and 33.3% were found as a mono-infection. In the UK cohort four (4.1%) samples were hMPV-positive, including two with co-infection. Co-infection with hMPV has been proposed to increase disease severity in some studies [5, 43, 44] , but not in others [45] . Dual infection with RSV is reportedly common, reflecting the overlapping seasonal distributions. One study reported that 70% of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis were co-infected with hMPV, suggesting that the disease caused by RSV may be augmented by a concurrent hMPV infection [44] . However, population-based and case control studies of hospitalized children have found that hMPV and RSV co-infections are uncommon [42, 43] . In our study, the low proportion of mono-infected patients suggests that hMPV rarely produces clinically significant infection by itself, but co-infection of hMPV with RSV was also uncommon (only two cases).",

The study considered only children admitted with LT-ARI, and did not include milder or asymptomatic infections. Several studies have shown that viruses can be found in children with no ARIs [22, 48] , and further research is needed to understand the respiratory viral carriage and infection. Although quantification of the virus load by PCR is possible, respiratory samples are heterogeneous, and different extractions of the same patient can lead to diverse results depending on chance variation in the amount of virus present in the aliquots extracted. Whilst the robustness of our findings is supported by the broad similarity between the two independent cohorts analyzed in the present study, its applicability to other populations is likely to be influenced by local epidemiological and host genetic factors.",
