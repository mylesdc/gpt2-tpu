            "text": "Influenza virus infection is a prevalent disease in humans. Antibodies against hemagglutinin have been shown to prevent infection and hence hemagglutinin is the major constituent of current vaccines. Antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of M2 have also been shown to mediate protection against Influenza A infection in various animal models. Active vaccination is generally considered the best approach to combat viral diseases. However, passive immunization is an attractive alternative, particularly in acutely exposed or immune compromized individuals, young children and the elderly. We recently described a novel method for the rapid isolation of natural human antibodies by mammalian cell display. Here we used this approach to isolate human monoclonal antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of the Influenza A M2 protein. The identified antibodies bound M2 peptide with high affinities, recognized native cell-surface expressed M2 and protected mice from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Moreover, therapeutic treatment up to 2 days after infection was effective, suggesting that M2-specific monoclonals have a great potential as immunotherapeutic agents against Influenza infection.",

Efficient influenza A vaccines are available, which induce antibodies predominantly against the two major components of the virus membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuramidase (NA). Protection is mediated primarily by neutralizing antibodies against HA [2, 3] . Since HA undergoes continuous change due to mutations (antigenic drift), new antigenic variants of influenza A arise every year requiring constant update of the vaccines. Effective vaccination is further complicated by the occasional reassortment of the segmented viral genome leading to the replacement of HA or NA from one subtype by another subtype, a processs called antigenic shift [4] . Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HA is very efficient [5] [6] [7] , however, suffers the same disadvantages as the current vaccines due to antigenic shift and drift.",

The matrix protein 2 (M2) fits the bill and has received considerable attention as a potential target against influenza infection over the past decades [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . M2 is a tetrameric ion channel [24] [25] [26] which is involved in virus uncoating in the endosome and in virus maturation in the trans-Golgi network [27] [28] [29] . Its 23 amino acid extracellular domain has remained remarkably conserved in human influenza A virus isolates over the last hundred years [30] , at least in part due to the fact that the M2 protein is cotranscribed with the matrix protein 1 (M1) [31, 32] . Whereas M2 is abundantly expressed on infected cells, only very few M2 molecules are present in Influenza A virus membranes [23, 26] . In accordance with this, current seasonal influenza vaccines do not induce a significant humoral resonse against M2, and M2 specific antibodies (administered intravenously or induced by active immunization) mediate protection not by neutralizing virions, but by eliminating infected cells by ADCC [15, 22] .",

In particular, it allows treating people which poorly respond to vaccines, such as the elderly, young children or immune compromised individuals. In addition, passive immunisation is the treatment option of choice in situations where rapid protection is crucial, such as for post-exposure treatment or prophylaxis for the acutely exposed. A number of M2 ectodomain (M2e)-specific mAbs have been reported to protect mice from a lethal challenge in a prophylactic setting [12, 17, [21] [22] [23] . While these mAbs include fully human antibodies derived from transchromosomic mice [22] , no natural human M2e-specific antibodies have been reported to date. However, for application in human subjects, natural human antibodies are the preferred choice. In contrast to humanized and fully human antibodies derived from phage display or transchromosomic mice, natural human antibodies combine the advantage of minimal immunogenicity with the smallest possible off-target reactivity and toxicity. Furthermore, human derived antibodies have the advantage of having gone through the affinity maturation process, resulting in high affinity antibodies.",

First, 334 M2e-specific B cells were isolated by FACS from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an individual with high M2e titers, using the M2e consensus peptide (M2e-cons) ( Table  1 ) conjugated to the virus-like particle Q\u03b2 as a bait. The immunoglobulin variable regions (VRs) of the heavy chains (HCs) and light chains (LCs) were then amplified by RT-PCR and assembled to single-chain antibody (scFv) coding regions. Two separate libraries, one encoding scFv antibodies with \u03ba, the other with \u03bb LCVRs, were cloned in the Sindbis cell surface display vector pDel-SP-TM [33] . The resulting scFv-\u03ba and scFv-\u03bb sublibraries consisted of 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 and 1.1 \u00d7 10 6 independent transformants, respectively. Since the library was derived from 334 cells, it may be expected that every possible combination of heavy and light chain is covered multiple times by the 2 million clones and, accordingly, that screening is likely to yield antibodies containing the natural heavy and light chain pairs. Recombinant Sindbis virus libraries were then generated with titers of 3.4 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/ml and 5.7 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/ ml, respectively, and used to infect BHK cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), to ascertain expression of a single antibody species per infected cell.",

No M2e-specific antibodies could be found on the surface of BHK cells infected with the scFv-\u03bb sublibrary. In contrast, BHK cells infected with the scFv-\u03ba sublibrary contained a substantial fraction of M2e-reactive cells (typically about 0.3% of infected cells). Three sorts were carried out with the scFv-\u03ba library, two using Q\u03b2-M2e-cons (not shown) and one using RNase-M2e-cons as bait ( Figure 1A ), leading to the isolation of 255 BHK cells each displaying an M2e-specific antibody. Single cells were sorted into wells containing BHK feeder cells and incubated for 2 to 3 days to allow for amplification of the corresponding Sindbis virus clone. In total, 201 of the 255 wells showed signs of viral infection and were reanalyzed for M2e binding, using RNase-M2e-cons as a bait ( Figure 1B ). 130 cells showing varying degrees of M2e binding were identified. Supernatants from wells containing infected BHK cells displaying highly M2e-reac-tive scFv were used to clone the corresponding scFv coding region by RT-PCR. The large number of specific antibodies isolated in a single screen not only illustrates the utility of mammalian cell display [33] , but also makes it an attractive alternative to other methods, typically based on cloning of antibodies from single or amplified B cell clones [34, 35] , or from EBV-immortalized memory B cells [36] .",

Thus, ELISA plates were coated with M2e-cons or M2e-VN peptide conjugated to RNAse A, and serial dilutions of the different scFv-msFc-\u03b32c antibodies were applied.

Thus, D005 was protective both as a scFv-msFc-\u03b32c fusion protein and as a fully human IgG1, indicating that the human antibody was able to recruit effector functions in the mouse system and that IgG-D005 may be used as a valuable prophylactic or therapeutic agent in humans.",
