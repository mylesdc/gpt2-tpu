The 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses and minimal sequence similarity with host proteins; therefore, the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) belongs to the Picornavidea family and is a major threat to the poultry industry. To date, little is known about the roles of the DHAV 3C protease plays during infection.",

The optimization of the cleavage assay conditions and the kinetic analysis for DHAV 3C protease were done by in vitro cleavage assays with a fluorogenic peptide respectively.

We used fluorimetric based kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters, and V max and K m values were determined to be 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 \u03bcM, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease. Using polyclonal antibody and an indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA), it was determined that the DHAV 3C protease was found in the nucleus during infection.

In contrast, adult ducks infected with DHAV do not become clinically ill, however, infection induces the egg drop syndrome [2] . DHAV was first described in the United States and isolated from chick embryos in 1949 [3] . Subsequently, outbreaks of duck viral hepatitis in other parts of the world including China, South Korea, and Japan were reported [4] [5] [6] . Birds are a well-known reservoir of infectious diseases. Due to the high mortality associated with the disease, DHAV causes significant financial losses, while no public health concern has been identified [3] . A previous study showed that natural infection occurs in domestic ducks [3] . DHAV infection was recently identified in mallards, goslings and pigeons [7] . A goose embryonated epithelial cell line efficiently assists with the replication of DHAV, which shows a higher virus titer compared to other duck cell lines [8] . Based on phylogenetic and neutralization assays, DHAV has been divided into three distinct genotypes: DHAV-1, DHAV-2, and DHAV-3 [1, 9] . DHAV-1 is the most common type and has spread worldwide, and the development of accurate detection methods is essential [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

            "text": "According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) report, DHAV belongs to the genus Avihepatovirus, as a member of the family Picornaviridae [15] . DHAV is a small, simple, nonenveloped, spherical icosahedral virus that is approximately 30 nm in diameter and contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.7 kb. The viral genome contains one open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a single polyprotein including structural proteins, P1 region (VP4/VP2/VP3/VP1), and nonstructural proteins, P2 (2A1/2A2/2A3/2B/2C) and P3 (3A/3B/3C/3D) regions, as well as two untranslated regions (5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR) [16] . The DHAV 3D protein was confirmed to recognize and bind the 3\u2032 UTR as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [17] . The processing of the polyprotein depends on viral proteases to produce functional and mature proteins. In general, the leader protease in aphthovirus, 2A protease in enteroviruses, and 3C protease in most picornaviruses contribute to the processing of the polyprotein [18, 19] . In contrast to the highly nonconserved 2A proteins in the family Picornaviridae, the 3C protease is a conserved chymotrypsin-like serine protease with a conserved catalytic triad of His-Asp-Cys. Furthermore, due to its structural conservation, the 3C protease is an important antiviral target for the development of inhibitors [20] [21] [22] [23] . Regarding DHAV, it does not possess an L protein but has three 2A proteins. Specifically, DHAV possesses an NPG/P autocleavage motif in 2A1, avrRpt2-induced gene 1 (AIG1) domain in 2A2, and H-NC motif in 2A3 protein [24, 25] . It is likely that the 3C protease is an important putative protease in DHAV for polyprotein processing [26] (Table 1) .",

For instance, the 3C protease could mediate the cleavage of cellular proteins such as cAMP response element-binding protein-1(CREB-1), polyadenylation factor (CstF-64), and TATA box binding protein (TBP), which are associated with the blockage of host genome transcription [27] [28] [29] . Furthermore, the 3C protease is capable of disrupting intrinsic immune responses by inhibiting the functions of some immune factors. During enterovirus infection, the 3C protease induces cleavage of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to escape host antiviral signaling [30] [31] [32] . In coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection, the 3C protease cleaves TRIF and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to suppress host immunity [33] . In DHAV infection, it has been reported that activation of the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pathway is involved in the immune response and viral clearance [34] . To date, some epidemiological, pathogenic and immunological mechanisms of DHAV have been reported [35] [36] [37] . It is likely that different picornaviruses adopt various strategies to interfere with cellular resources.",

Figure 6 shows the localization of the 3C protease in DEF cells infected with DHAV at 3, 6, and 9 h postinfection (hpi). This 3C antibody could not react with mock-infected cells, and the signal in infected cells colocalized with a FITC-UTP stain that was added to mark the localization of the 3C protease. The 3C protease was observed in the cytoplasm as early as 3 hpi. At 6 hpi, strong fluorescence corresponding to the 3C protease was detected in the nucleus. It seemed that the DHAV 3C protease had the ability to potentially target the nucleus. To confirm whether the 3C protease entered into the nucleus directly or through a 3C-containing precursor, we cloned the 3C sequence and 3C variants into a pEGFP-N1 vector. The nucleotide sequences of the 3C variants encoding for H38 and C144 were mutated into sequences encoding alanine residues to create single variants of the 3C protease. Then, the N-terminally GFP-tagged 3C protease and variants were expressed as in DEF cells. As shown in Fig. 8A , it was observed that the fluorescence of EGFP-3C and its variants were distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. An indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) assay was carried out to verify that the fluorescence came from the 3C fusion proteins instead of free GFP. The results showed that the 3C fusion proteins were correctly expressed in DEF cells (Fig. 7a) . Notably, some fluorescent signals were generated in the cytoplasm of cells expressing EGFP-3C-H38A and EGFP-3C-C144A. Untagged 3C was located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that the ability to enter into the nucleus was not the result of GFP expression (Fig. 7b) .

            "text": "Many picornaviruses are significant human and animal pathogens that cause considerable economic burdens. Viral proteases (2A protease and 3C protease) have been attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs [44, 45] . Proteases in the Caliciviridae family (3C-like protease, 3CL protease) and Coronaviridae family (3CL protease, papain-like protease) were shown to function similarly in proteolytic processing [46, 47] . Conserved viral genes, including those encoding a 3C protease or 3CL protease, characterize the viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster. Possessing common characteristics, for example, conserved active sites, the 3C proteases and 3CL proteases serve as conducive targets for the design of broad-spectrum and safe antiviral drugs [48] [49] [50] . Sequence alignment suggests that the DHAV 3C protein possesses a 3C cysteine protease domain and a typical Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad. In this study, we applied FRET-based assays to determine the activity of DHAV 3C protease. When the peptide bond was cleaved by the 3C protease, it caused the separation of the fluorescence quencher moiety and fluorophore. Due to the disappearance of the FRET effect, the fluorescence of the fluorophore was detected. Hence, FRET-based assays have been applied successfully to monitor protease activity, and substrates that are recognized and cleaved are required for this assay. By testing autoprocessing sites (VP2-VP3, VP3-VP1, 2A-2C, 3A-3B, 3B-3C and 3C-3D), EV71 showed the most efficient enzyme activity towards the 3B-3C junction site. The EV71 3C protease showed the activity (K m = 30 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM, V max = 85 \u00b1 1.4 nM min \u2212 1 ) against the 3B-3C junction site [38] . The 2C-3A junction could be rapidly hydrolyzed in poliovirus (PV)-infected HeLa cells. Based on the HPLC assay, the 2C-3A junction was the most efficient substrate for 3C protease of EV71 and CVA16. Subsequently, using FRET peptides confirmed that peptide containing 2A-3C junction was most efficiently cleaved with a K m of 63.2 \u00b1 3.6 \u03bcM [44] . Therefore, the 2C-3A junction in the polyprotein of DHAV was used to design the fluorescence peptide. The DHAV 3C protease demonstrated the activity against the 2C-3A junction (K m = 50.78 \u03bcM, V max = 16.52 nmol/min). Here, we have report for the first time the substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of the DHAV 3C protease, which could provide basic information for antiviral development in the future. In addition, we have evaluated the inhibitory activity of AG7088 for the DHAV 3C protease. Further experiments are needed to detect other efficient substrates.",

This result is consistent with the observations of the 3C protease in other picornaviruses. The wild-type (WT) 3C protease sequence was altered with a histidine-or cysteine-to-alanine base substitution to create 3C protease mutants with greatly reduced catalytic activity. We observed fusion protease distribution throughout the cell except for some fluorescent signals in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with EGFP-3C-H38A and EGFP-3C-C144A. It was reported that when HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP-3C [containing a PV 3C gene sequence], EGFP expression was detected throughout the entire cells. Due to the generation of high quantities of free GFP in cells transfected with EGFP-3C, whether the 3C protease could localize to the nucleus was inconclusive [51] . In a previous report, it was confirmed that 3D and 3CD precursor proteins could enter the nucleus in PV-infected cells. However, these proteins localized to the cytoplasm of uninfected cells [51] . Furthermore, 2A pro of PV was demonstrated to be responsible for the redistribution of 3CD to the nucleus [52] . Subsequently, the HRV 3C protease was demonstrated to have a nuclear-targeting ability by causing the degradation of nuclear pore components [53] . The localization of the 3C protease in the nucleus is important for host cell transcription shut-off induced by picornaviruses. Hence, this has significant implications for future research.",

More research on the protease activity of the viral 3C protease is still ongoing. For example, the 69th residue (Asp) of EV 3C has been identified as a novel and important site that is involved in protease activity and is a virulence determinant [55] . Furthermore, the 3C protease of PV lost protease activity when the 70th residue (Leu) was mutated to proline [56] . In this study, the 3C protease was obtained by prokaryotic expression, and its enzymatic activity was detected with a cleavage assay in vitro. Our results demonstrated the localization of the 3C protease in DHAV infected cells and transfected cells and its ability to move into the nucleus. These findings provide us with an important starting point to determine the function of the DHAV 3C protease.",
