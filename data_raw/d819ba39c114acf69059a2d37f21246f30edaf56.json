The proteolytic cleavage site was added to allow the specific removal of the tag for structural studies. We avoided the use of cysteine proteases (like Prescission, TEV or 3C proteases) which, although are very specific, require a reducing agent for activity, which could also reduce some of the exposed disulfides of the glycoprotein. We instead engineered an enterokinase (EK) cleavage site, which is a serine-protease relatively specific for the sequence (Asp) 4 Lys\u2193X, cleaving at the site indicated by the arrow with a cleavage efficiency between 60 and 80 % (X being any amino acid) [4] . This resulted in the following amino acid sequence downstream of the ApaI and BstBI sites ...DDDDKAGWSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGGSWSHPQFEK-COOH. All synthetic HCV glycoprotein genes were purchased from GeneCust (Dudelange, Luxemburg) and amplified by PCR using strain specific 5'-oligonucleotides containing Bgl II, which allows insertion immediately downstream of the BiP secretion signal, and strain specific 3'-oligonucleotides containing Apa I.",

Thus trypsin cleavage prediction in this region resulted in one peptide containing 4 cysteines, aligned sequentially in a way that the first two cysteines and the last two each have a proline residue in between. Analysis of peak 33-2 revealed only peptide H4, which corresponds to the predicted peptide containing 4 cysteines (positions 564, 569, 581 and 585, respectively). Mass spectrometry revealed a peak matching the predicted mass of this peptide containing two intrapeptidic disulfide bridges (Fig.   S3G , 2504.50 Da). Under non-reducing conditions two minor peaks could be observed, which are shifted by exactly 2 Da and thus likely correspond to partially reduced peptides in the original HPLC peak. Since we had already identified the disulfide bond between Cys581 and Cys585 in UKN2b_2.8 E2, this result strongly indicates the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys564 and Cys569.",

Cells were subsequently washed and infected with 7x10 3 FFU of HCVcc in the presence of identical concentrations of the respective viral glycoproteins. After a 5h adsorption period at 37\u00b0C, the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh medium. At 3 days post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and subsequently processed for core detection by indirect immunofluorescence using 0.5 \u00b5g/mL of anti-core monoclonal antibody 1851 (Abcys, Paris, France) and Alexafluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution. Coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) allowing counterstaining of 6 cell nuclei. Virus titers were determined by counting labeled foci following acquisition of mosaic images spanning the entire surface of each coverslip using an Axioplan2i microscope (Zeiss) with a Wide Field ApoTome (Zeiss) and the Axiovision software (Zeiss). The mean value of all three concentrations (0.5\u00b5M, 1\u00b5M and 2\u00b5M) of both control proteins was taken as 100%.

CD spectra were obtained with an AVIV CD spectropolarimeter model 215 using a 0.02cm path length cell at room temperature. Five successive scans were averaged and the background spectrum of the sample buffer, acquired under identical conditions, was subtracted.
