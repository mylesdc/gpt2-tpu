            "text": "Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti-influenza compound, ZBMD-1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell-based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD-1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC 50 ranging from 0.41-1.14 lM. Furthermore, ZBMD-1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD-1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD-1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/ 8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD-1 is a promising anti-influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.",

Vaccines are currently available to control infections in humans. However, mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of circulating viruses easily escape the surveillance by the host immune system [4] . Specific antiviral drugs are available for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment for individuals infected with IAV. Two classes of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-influenza drugs are currently used in the treatment of IAV infections including NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir [5] , and matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors such as amantadine and rimantadine [6, 7] . However, resistance development is a serious problem for antiviral drugs, particularly when the target viral proteins continuously undergo a high frequency of antigenic drift [8] [9] [10] . Most human influenza viruses, including pandemic 2009 H1N1 and H7N9, are currently resistant to amantadine/rimantadine or oseltamivir [11] [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, identification of novel antiviral targets and development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infections are imperative.",

During the late stage of infection, NP, nuclear export protein (NEP) and matrix protein (M1) mediate the transport of the newly assembled vRNP complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. [21] . Overall, NP has several conformations and activities that are conserved among all influenza A viruses and has no cellular equivalent [15] . Thus, NP is an ideal target for the development of commercial anti-influenza drugs.",

We then performed a dose-response assay among the hit compounds and identified seven compounds that exerted an inhibitory effect by more than 50% at a concentration of 10 lM. Among the anti-influenza hits, compound ZBMD-1 showed the highest potency against influenza A virus in a plaque reduction assay (PRA) on MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The chemical structure of compound ZBMD-1 was shown in Figure 1A . Using a plaque assay, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of ZBMD-1 against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in MDCK cells was lower than 2 lM (Fig. 1B) . ZBMD-1 showed a similar level of antiviral activity against different IAV subtypes including A/Guangdong/1/2009 (H1N1) virus (IC 50 = 1.14 AE 0.21 lM) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus (IC 50 = 0.41 AE 0.09 lM) (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, ZBMD-1 had low toxicity in MDCK, A549 and 293T cells. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of the compound was >100 lM (Fig. 1B) . Together, these results show that compound ZBMD-1 significantly inhibits the replication of IAVs. ",

To further confirm the inhibitory effect of ZBMD-1 on the viral polymerase activity of infected cells, we performed an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to examine whether ZBMD-1 affects the nuclear transport of vRNP. Because influenza virus NP is the major component of the vRNP complex, the location of NP in infected cells represents the location of vRNP complex [1, 21] . Accordingly, a reduction in viral NP protein expression was also detected by IFA assay (Fig. 2E) . We found that NP in the cells treated with DMSO (negative control) was predominantly located in the cytoplasm at 12 hrs p.i.. However, after treated with ZBMD-1, most of NP was located in the nucleus (Fig. 2E) , indicating that in the presence of ZBMD-1, the vRNP complex was able to enter the nucleus but was not exported to the cytoplasm afterwards. The retention of NP in the nucleus was more obvious with higher doses of ZBMD-1.

To exclude the possibility that ZBMD-1 is an LMB-like CRM1 inhibitor, we examined the effect of ZBMD-1 on the nuclear export of activation-induced deaminase (AID), a well-known host protein that is exported from the nucleus via the CRM-1 nuclear export pathway [38] . Figure 4C shows that ZBMD-1 did not inhibit the nuclear export of AID-GFP, whereas LMB treatment did. AID-GFP is unstable in the nucleus [39] , and LMB treatment resulted in the degradation of AID-GFP (Fig. 4D) . However, ZBMD-1 treatment did not affect the expression of AID-GFP. Together, these results suggest that ZBMD-1 specifically targets on NP, but not on the CRM1 transport system. ",

For unbiased predictive docking analysis, we searched for potential docking sites within the entire NP monomer. Five potential binding sites were identified (Fig. 5A) . Based on the highest binding free energy, binding site 1 of ZBMD-1 within NP was selected for further analysis. The configuration with the best binding score (DG of \u00c048.37 kcal/mol) was also identified and used in further studies (Fig. 5B) . Two amino acid residues (F338 and R267, hydrogen bond) play a major role in ZBMD-1 binding to NP (Fig. 5B) . To further confirm the accuracy of this binding model, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment was utilized to examine whether ZBMD-1 binds to wild-type and mutant NP proteins harbouring alanine substitutions within potential binding sites (from R267 to 267A and F338 to 338A mutant). The SPR assay indicated that ZBMD-1 dose-dependently bound to the wild-type NP-His or mutant NP-His with Kd values of 10.6 or 131.6 lmol/l, respectively ( Fig. 5C and D) . Although ZBMD-1 remained bind to His-tagged mutant NP protein, its binding affinity was significantly lower than that to wild-type NP protein, thereby indicating that these two residues play critical roles in the interaction between ZBMD-1 and NP. These results suggest that ZBMD-1 binds to NP mainly through amino acid residues, R267 and F338, which were predicted by in silico docking analysis.",

A previous study has shown that the nuclear export mediated by NES1 or NES2 is CRM1-independent, whereas that by NES3 is CRM1-dependent [40] . To further investigate whether the inhibitory effect of ZBMD-1 on the nuclear export of NP depends on the CRM1 nuclear transport pathway, we examined the binding of endogenous CRM1 to NP in the presence or absence of ZBMD-1. The binding between NP and CRM1 was inhibited by ZBMD-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5E ). This result indicates that ZBMD-1 inhibits the binding between NP and CRM1 through interacting with NES domain of NP.",

Mice were inoculated with 10 LD 50 of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and intraperitoneally injected daily with different doses of ZBMD-1 (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg twice per day) for five days beginning at 6 hrs after infection, respectively (Fig. 6A) . ZBMD-1 treatment apparently protected the mice from influenza-induced morbidity and lethality ( Fig. 6B and  C) . In a parallel experiment, mice were killed from each group at 3d p.i., and the lungs were isolated and used in the determination of virus titre by plaque assay (Fig. 6D and E) . The virus load in lungs of ZBMD-1-treated mice was significantly lower than that of control group. Moreover, ZBMD-1 and oseltamivir phosphate were co-administrated to investigate the antiviral activity of ZBMD-1 treated together with oseltamivir phosphate. Although ZBMD-1 was less effectively protected the mice from influenza in vivo compared to that of oseltamivir phosphate, the co-administration of ZBMD-1 and oseltamivir phosphate resulted in an even lower degree of weight loss and a higher survival rate (up to 75%) than those treated with ZBMD-1 or oseltamivir phosphate alone (Fig. 6F and G) . These results further support the hypothesis that the mechanisms of ZBMD-1 and oseltamivir phosphate are highly variable and better in vivo effect is observed when administered in combination. Co-administration of ZBMD-1 and oseltamivir phosphate also significantly reduced the viral load in lung (Fig. 6H) .

Arrow a, infiltration of inflammatory cells; arrow b, alveolar wall thickening. Scale bars, 200 lM. alleviated the inflammation and interstitial epithelium thickening that was induced by the IAV infection (Fig. 7C-H) . These observations imply that ZBMD-1 probably limits further spread of the virus in the lungs, thereby alleviating inflammation. In line with Figure 7 , these results also indicate that ZBMD-1 inhibits the replication of IAV in vivo, which in turn alleviates the inflammatory levels and pathology induced by IAV. Our overall findings suggest that ZBMD-1 has potent anti-inflammatory effects against the host intense immune response induced by IAV.",

ZBMD-1 efficiently protected cells against different subtypes of influenza A virus. In particular, ZBMD-1 was able to inhibit the replication of A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus with a relatively low concentration (IC 50 = 0.41 AE 0.09 nM) in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo data indicated that ZBMD-1 reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and alleviates the infiltration of inflammation in lungs that is caused by IAV infection. It also increased the survival rate of mice and prevented body weight loss due to IAV infection. These results suggest that ZBMD-1 effectively inhibits IAV replication and reduces the viral titres in vitro and in vivo, which in turn further alleviates the pathology induced by IAV. These findings suggest that ZBMD-1 has potent anti-inflammatory effects against the host intense immune response induced by IAV, thereby rendering it as a promising lead compound for the treatment of severe influenza.",

Further investigation indicated that ZBMD-1 blocks the nuclear transport of vRNP complex from the nucleus through targeting the nuclear export of NP. Three NESs were identified within the NP. Export via NES1 and NES2 is independent on the CRM1 transport pathway, whereas export via NES3 is dependent on CRM1 binding [40] . Therefore, the nuclear retention of NP that was induced by ZBDM-1 may be due to the disruption of the following pathways: (i) ZBMD-1 targets the NES1 or NES2 within NP; (ii) ZBMD-1 targets the NES3 within NP that further blocks the interaction between NP and CRM1; and (iii) ZBMD-1 targets the CRM1 or its associated proteins. To exclude that CRM1 is the direct target of ZBMD-1, we utilized an AID-GFP-expressing plasmid in our experiments because AID is a classic host protein that is transported from the nucleus and is mainly mediated by the CRM1 pathway [21] . The distribution of AID-GFP was not affected by ZBMD-1, whereas the classical small molecule inhibitor LMB blocked the nuclear export of AID. Therefore, ZBMD-1 did not directly inhibit the CRM1 transport pathway as LMB did. To further explore the particular binding sites of ZBMD-1 within NP, docking analysis that incorporated the structure of ZBMD-1 within NP was performed. This result showed that the potential binding site of ZBMD-1 within NP is a small pocket that included NES3. In line with the binding model, further investigation proved that ZBMD-1 directly binds to NP and disrupts the interaction between NP and CRM1. Moreover, the docking analysis and SPR assay indicated that aa F338 of NP was another important binding site for ZBMD-1. In line with these results, ZBMD-1 inhibited the NP-NP interaction, which further reduced the polymerase activity and impaired the protein synthesis of IAV. Taken together, these results strongly support our theory that NP is the target of ZBMD-1.",

The discovery of new target has thus been the focus on the development of new anti-influenza therapeutics. Sequence analysis has indicated that NP is a well-conserved protein among different strains of IAV [15] . Furthermore, the target sites of ZBMD-1 within the NP (R267 and F338) were highly conserved (>99% conservation) [15] , thereby indicating that ZBMD-1 has a broadly inhibitory potency against various IAV strains, including the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes and the polymerase activity of H7N9 subtype. An alternative challenge for drug design and development is to avoid the occurrence of serious side effects. Influenza NP protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. The activity, assembly, stability and nuclear transport of vRNP complex all rely on the function of NP [1] . Therefore, NP is a highly conserved and functionally restricted protein, thus rendering it a promising specific target for anti-influenza drug design.",

The pocket targeted by this compound was reported to be surrounded by three different domains, namely the RNA binding groove, the NP dimer interface and NES3. In the present study, the binding pocket of ZBMD-1 within NP in our study was similar to that of RK424. Based on similar function and different chemical structures, we concluded that the binding pocket of ZBMD-1 is an indispensable pocket of NP, which would be an ideal antiviral target sides. In our studies, ZBMD-1 was shown to inhibit IAV replication in vitro and in vivo efficiently. Because ZBMD-1 is one of the first-generation hit compounds identified via high-throughput screening, it could be further optimized to become more potent inhibitors.",

(A) The potential binding sites (highlighted by yellow circles) of ZBMD-1 on the influenza A NP crystal structure as predicted by in silico docking analysis. Red, negative charge; blue, positive charge; light grey, neutral charge. (B) Close-up view of the indicated small pocket. Two predictive binding residues (R267 and F338) within NP are shown. The nuclear export signal 3 (NES) domain (amino acid [aa] 256-266) is shown as yellow; RNA binding grove (aa 1-180) is shown as orange; NP dimer interface (aa 482-489) is shown as purple; the binding pocket of ZBMD-1 within NP surrounding F338 is shown as green, and pocket surrounding R267 is blue. (C and D) The binding of ZBMD-1 to influenza NP (C) or its mutant (D) was evaluated using a SPR assay. The sensorgrams were obtained by injecting a series of concentrations of ZBMD-1 over the immobilized NP or mutant NP chip. BIA evaluation software was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). The binding affinity of ZBMD-1 with wild-type NP-His or mutant NP-His with Kd values of 10.6 (C) or 131.6 lmol/l (D), respectively. Two independent experiments were performed and one representative result is shown, respectively. (E) The effect of ZBMD-1 on the interaction between NP and CRM1. Human 293T cells were transfected with NP-HA-expressing plasmid and treated with different amounts of ZBMD-1 at 12 hrs p.t. The cells were collected and lysed for immunoprecipitation using anti-HA agarose. The associated CRM1 was determined by Western blotting with an anti-CRM1 antibody. (F) Effect of ZBMD-1 on NP-NP interaction. Human 293T cells were transfected with NP-HA-and NP-FLAG-expressing plasmids and treated with different amounts of ZBMD-1 at 12 hrs p.t. The cells were collected and lysed for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA agarose. The associated NP-FLAG was determined by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. \u00aa 2017 The Authors.
