The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. Methods: We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. Results: Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles. SEC61G, IL17RA, HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The CpG islands of all 3 genes were hypomethylated compared to controls. This suggests that dysregulation of these genes involved in immunological response could be a common mechanism in BEN pathogenesis in both endemic regions and in both genders. Conclusion: Our data propose a new hypothesis that immunologic dysregulation has a place in BEN etiopathogenesis.",

The disease shows familial clustering with affected individuals in several subsequent generations [3] . BEN has a slow progression leading often to terminal kidney failure. The disease has a striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract -about 30-40% of the affected BEN individuals develop such a type of tumour [4, 5] .

Various chemical elements, organic and non-organic compounds, viruses and microorganisms are implicated in BEN development. Statistically significant differences in soil concentration of heavy metals such as Mg, Mo, Cd, Pb As, Se, Ca, Cu are observed between endemic and non-endemic regions [6] , although there is no direct link of a toxic effect of any heavy metal to the disease development. Since BEN has similarities in pathomorphological characteristics with Chinese herbal nephropathy, a common etiology (toxic effect of the aristolochic acid) of both disorders was proposed. There is no irrefutable evidence supporting the effect of aristolochic acid on BEN development. Nevertheless there is a link between aristolochic acid and malignancies in BEN patients [7] . The mycotoxin ochratoxin A is supposed to have a synergic effect with other agents in BEN development [8] . Although there are different papers reporting on numerous viruses (Picorna virus, Polyoma virus, Herpes simplex 1 and 2, Adenovirus, Hepatitis B, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) found in kidney samples of BEN patients [9, 10] , there is no substantial evidence supporting viral etiopathogenesis of BEN.",

There is evidence that the share of rapid debrisoquine metabolizers is higher in BEN patients than in healthy controls [13] , thus polymorphic variants in CYP2D6 causing sensitivity to various chemical agents are suspected in BEN pathogenesis. Partial LCAT deficiency was also studied in the context of BEN, since LCAT deficient individuals show evidence of renal tubular injury [14] .

The epigenetic characteristics are maintained by specific mechanisms that firstly ensure the epigenetic profile through cell generations and secondly allow the cell to perform specific functions (differentiation) and to adapt according to different stimuli [17] . The major epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA interference [18] . The dynamics of epigenetic processes allow the cells to respond reversibly and in a precise way to environmental stimuli, but also preserve cell type specific gene programmes. When alteration of epigenetic pattern occurs, diseases such as cancer could occur through pathological gene expression. Epigenetic changes over time display familial clustering [19] . This could explain the clustering of some common diseases in families and actually the epigenetic pattern could be implicated in transmitting a \"predisposition\" over generations.",

CpG islands are defined as DNA sequences sizing at least 200 bp; the GC content is more than 50%, and with an observed-to-expected CpG ratio greater than 60% [21] . More than 50% of human genes contain a CpG island in their promoter region [20, 22] . DNA methylation in promoter regions is mostly associated with gene silencing and lower gene expression levels. CpG island methylation is involved physiologically in genomic imprinting, X inactivation and cell differentiation. As well as a fundament for physiological regulation, DNA methylation processes can be involved in disease. An aberrant methylation profile is observed in different cancers [20, 22] .",

In the present study we aimed to investigate the methylation status across the whole-genome in different patient groups, based on gender and endemic region, in comparison to healthy controls from non-endemic regions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in different patient-control pairs and after compiling the DMRs data from all pairs the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN.

The methylated DNA sample was labelled with Cy5 (Cyanine5-red channel) and the reference sample was labelled with Cy3 (Cyanine3-green channel) using Agilent Genomic DNA enzymatic labelling kit (Agilent inc.). Concentration and dye incorporation were measured by Nanodrop2000c. Over 5 \u03bcg was considered a good yield. Dye incorporation was considered satisfactory if Cy3 incorporation was between 18-25 pmol/\u03bcg and Cy5 incorporation 7-20 pmol/\u03bcg. Hybridization was performed on Agilent methylation DNA array (1x244k), conditions were according to Agilent protocol (20 RPM for 40 hrs). The washing procedure was performed by Agilent washing solutions. Slides were immediately scanned on Agilent scanner G2505. Data were extracted by Agilent Feature extraction software (v.11.0.1.1) and raw data analysis was performed by Agilent Genomic Workbench Lite (v6.5.0.18). The probe methylation status was assessed by BATMAN assay (Bayesian tool for methylation analysis). Bayesian deconvolution strategy takes into account the estimated distribution of DNA fragment lengths, so that it can discover the most likely configurations of methylated and unmethylated CpGs in a sequence that explains the observed MeDIP signals. This allows estimation of absolute methylation levels. Results were generated in Excel table. We developed our own software for data mining. We designed software to scan through preliminary data to assess the methylation status of all 27 000 CpG islands. When over 60% of probes were methylated (according to BATMAN call) a CpG-island was defined as \"methylated\", and when over 60% of probes were unmethylated (according to BATMAN call) the CpGislands were considered \"unmethylated\" [25] . CpG islands with methylated or unmethylated probes in the range 40-60% were considered \"intermediate methylation\" and since an unequivocal call of methylation status for these CpG islands was not possible we excluded them from further analysis. Thus we were able to determine the absolute methylation status of all CpG-islands.",

The percentage of DMRs throughout the DMR is the same in the last 3 pairs -3.4%. The only significant disparity is the Bulgarian female group (patients/controls) -1%. This can be attributed to the number of samples in the pool, which is twice as large as the others. This can smooth out the difference in methylation status between patients and controls. As in every pool analysis, in this design also large sample sizes render out small changes in small subsets of patients that can contribute to the disease, but since we are looking for more prominent alterations affecting the greater part of the affected individuals we can classify that as a small drawback.",

So far this method has been applied to the study of large scale of disorders varying from different types of cancers [26] to diabetes [27] , chronic kidney disease [18, 28] , rheumatoid arthritis [29] and atherosclerosis [30] . Epigenetics unravels new possible pathogenic mechanisms to common diseases.",

The separate analysis of the DMRs according to gene function in Bulgarian and Serbian patients revealed several processes to be affected to a similar extent in both groups -cell cycle/cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization, oncogenesis and metastasis, immune response and transcription regulation. These processes, if deregulated, most likely contribute to a molecular pathogenesis of BEN and a predisposition to uroepithelial tumours. Making a smaller DMRs contribution are miRNA, signal transduction, mRNA processing and DNA replication. It appears that these processes may be deregulated in BEN. Of great interest is the fact that genes involved in innate immune response, inflammation and antiviral immunity seem to be involved in BEN. This is in accordance with the hypothesis of an abnormal immune response to viral and other external stimuli. In our 3rd level analysis, by comparing the DMRs between all patient-control pairs we discovered 3 genes that are differentially methylated in patients/controls -HDAC11, IL17RA, SEC61G These genes represent our most prominent candidate-genes based on the screening we performed.",

            "text": "The CpG island in the promotor area of HDAC11 is hypomethylated in all four patient groups and hypermethylated in all healthy controls groups. HDAC11 encodes a class IV histone deacetylase. This is responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Histone deacetylation tags for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases do not act autonomously but as components of large multiprotein complexes that mediate important transcription regulatory pathways HDACs have a role in cell growth arrest, differentiation and death. The exact biological function is still to be clarified. HDAC11 is suggested to have a role not only in normal human tissue processes, but also in the development and progression of human neoplasia [31] . Preliminary studies suggest that the aberrant expression is not due to gene amplification, but rather a result of dysregulation of HDAC11 gene expression [32] , which is consistent with our hypothesis of aberrant hypomethylation leading to excessive activity of HDAC11 and may be involved in the pathogenesis of BEN. HDAC11 is suggested to exist in a protein complex different from the known co-repressor complexes, that participate in other processes apart from strictly modulating chromatin composition [31] . Dysregulation of HDAC11 activity could be a cofactor in tumourogenesis. Inhibition of HDAC11 transcripts is proved to stimulate the production of tumour necrosis-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-17 in the supernatants of HL ( Hodgkin lymphoma) cells, suggesting invlovement of HDAC11 in immune response modulation. Furthermore, considering the high incidence of urothelial malignancies, we could speculate that HDAC11 deregulation can contribute to a disproportionate immune response and immunological tolerance to malignant cells in BEN patients.",

It codes a receptor for Il-17 family. The effect of IL-17 family cytokines is mediated by members of the IL-17 receptor family, IL-17 R/IL-17 RA, IL-17 B R/IL-17 RB, IL-17 RC, IL-17 RD, and IL-17 RE. Activation of these receptors triggers intracellular pathways that induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-17A, IL-17 F, and IL-17A/F are produced primarily by activated T cells and signal through an oligomerized receptor complex consisting of IL-17 RA and IL-17 RC. Ligand binding to this complex leads to recruitment of the intracellular adaptor proteins and activation of the transcription factors, NF kappa B, AP-1, and C/EBP. Overexpression of IL-17RA can lead to overstimulation of the immune response towards certain peptides by the magnified effect of IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-17C and could facilitate an abnormal inflammation response leading to nephritis. IL-17RA dysregualtion is implicated in major immunemediated inflammatory disease such as Chron's disease [33] and psoriatic arthritis [34] .",

Little is known about the role of SEC61 complex in health and disease. According to MOPED data [36] SEC61 complex is expressed in T-lymphocytes and HEK-293 cell line. The fact that SEC61G is overexpressed in T-lymphocytes is also in line with our hypothesis of immunological involvement in BEN. SEC61G is strongly expressed in HEK293 cell line and bearing in mind that HEK-293 is an embryonic kidney cell line, this may imply that SEC61 is an important factor for early stage kidney cell growth and development. The exact function of this pathway in the adult kidney still remains to be investigated.",
