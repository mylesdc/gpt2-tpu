The nature of the innate immune response to hMPV in naturally occurring infections in children is largely undescribed, and it is unknown if inflammasome activation is implicated in disease pathogenesis. We examined nasopharynx aspirates and blood samples from hMPV-infected children without detectable co-infections. The expression of inflammatory and antiviral genes were measured in nasal airway secretions by relative mRNA quantification while blood plasma proteins were determined by a multiplex immunoassay. Several genes were significantly up-regulated at mRNA and protein level in the hMPV infected children. Most apparent was the expression of the chemokine IP-10, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 in addition to the interferon inducible gene ISG54. Interestingly, children experiencing more severe disease, as indicated by a severity index, had significantly more often up-regulation of the inflammasome-associated genes IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3. Overall, our data point to cytokines, particularly inflammasome-associated, that might be important in hMPV mediated lung disease and the antiviral response in children with severe infection. Our study is the first to demonstrate that inflammasome components are associated with increased illness severity in hMPV-infected children.",

For the purpose of the present study, 30 children satisfying all of these criteria were recruited: an NPA was sampled less than one week after onset of symptoms and within one day after admittance, either hMPV genotypes A2 or B2 were detected in NPA, no viral co-infections detected in NPA, and serum levels of CRP <100 mg/L. Clinical data were recorded prospectively or retracted from medical records. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was diagnosed when rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and/or otitis media (serous, simplex or purulent) was found without signs of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). LRTI was diagnosed in children with signs and symptoms of respiratory difficulty such as tachypnea, retractions and nasal flaring, signs of lower airway obstruction (wheezing, prolonged expiration, rhonchi), focal findings (crepitations) and/or a positive chest x-ray (infiltrates, atelectasis, air trapping). LRTI was divided in bronchiolitis (age <2 years, tachypnea, retractions, wheezing, crepitations), obstructive bronchitis (age >2 years, signs of lower airway obstruction), asthma exacerbation with signs of lower airway obstruction, and pneumonia (cough, tachypnea, localized crepitations, x-ray infiltrates). A clinical severity score previously used to determine hMPV/RSV disease severity in children [7, 8] was calculated for each infected child as the sum of these variables 1) length of hospital stay 5 days (1 point), 2) oxygen demand (1 point), 3) ventilatory support by continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (1 point), and 4) ventilatory support by endotracheal intubation and overpressure ventilation (2 points).",

As shown in Fig 1B, the mRNA levels of the type II IFN-\u03b3 was not elevated in any of the patient groups relative to the controls. In correspondence with this, IFN-\u03b3 protein was not detected in the blood samples from any of the investigated children (data not shown). Finally we evaluated the mRNA expression of the type III IFN IL-28. Fig 1C shows that both the A2 and B2 positive patients had significantly increased levels of IL-28 expression. Next, we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of NF-\u03baB and inflammasome-associated genes in response to hMPV infection. Fig 2 shows the mRNA expression of A) I\u03baB\u03b1, a repressor gene induced by NF-\u03baB activation [19] , B) IL-1\u03b2, C) IL-18 and D) NLRP3 in hMPV infected children and controls.

However, for the other genes investigated their expression was not significantly increased compared to the controls.",

We performed an analysis of NPAs and blood samples collected from children hospitalized with RTI. Herein, we identify specific cytokines, such as IP-10, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, and ISG54, that are elevated in hMPV mediated lung disease. Of noteworthy interest is the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 in samples from children with the most severe respiratory tract infection. This suggests that the inflammasome is involved in the innate immune response to hMPV in these patients, either as a protective mechanism or as a response to lung damage. Type I and III IFNs are responsible for the induction of an antiviral state in cells immediately after infection [20] . While type I IFNs are produced by many different cell types, type III IFNs seems to be mostly produced by plasmacytoid dendritic and epithelial cells where the epithelial cells are the main targets for activity [21] . Due to their powerful and potentially harmful effects, the production of these cytokines is tightly regulated [22] . Our results showed that the type I IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in NPA was marginally up-regulated for the A2 infected patients, but the protein concentrations in plasma were markedly increased for both A2 and B2 positive patients. This inconsistency could be explained by the protein being produced by tissue resident cells in e.g. the lung or lymph nodes. Another explanation could be a lag in the induction of protein synthesis in the epithelial cells after the elevation of mRNA transcription, since it is assumed that cytokines are able to enter the bloodstream from lung tissue during inflammation. For type III IFN IL-28 we observed increased mRNA expression both for A2 and B2 infected children. However, IL-28 protein was not significantly elevated in blood plasma. IL-28 is prominently expressed in lung epithelial cells, and suggested to prevent viral invasion through skin and mucosal surfaces [23] . Hence, the lack of increased IL-28 protein in blood could, similar as suggested for IFN-\u03b2, be explained by a lag in the induction of protein synthesis.",

Further, elevated levels of IP-10 protein, and also of the chemokines Gro-\u03b1 and Gro-\u03b2 were found in blood plasma. IP-10 has previously been shown to be significantly elevated seven days post infection with hMPV A2 in mice [27] . The expression of IP-10 may be induced by IFN-\u03b3 [28] , IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [29] or TNF-\u03b1 [30] secreted by different immune-cells. In our study, despite elevated IP-10, we did not measure any increased expression of the type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 at mRNA or plasma protein levels. The lack of IFN-\u03b3 detection in NPAs from hMPV infected children has also recently been reported elsewhere [31] . Our data suggests that IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, which was significantly detectable in plasma, might be responsible for induction of IP-10. In addition, IFN-\u03b3-independent induction of IP-10 has been demonstrated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [32] . In this setting the type III interferon IL-29, which is closely related to IL-28 that was shown to be upregulated herein, was correlated to IP-10 induction. Of note, when infecting human epithelial cells with hMPV in vitro, we observed that IL-28 mRNA was induced and that IL-29 showed a similar trend (data not shown), as also suggested elsewhere [24] . Hence, IL-28/29 could mediate IFN-\u03b3 independent IP-10 induction in hMPV infection. IFN-\u03b3-independent IP-10 expression has also previously been reported in BAL samples from patients during respiratory tract virus infection [33] .",

An explanation for this could be different expression kinetics for mRNA and protein. TNF-\u03b1 induces NF-\u03baB [34] and, among other functions, it is involved in the recruitment of neutrophilic cells to the lungs [35] . TNF-\u03b1 production has previously been shown to be at high levels in nasopharyngeal secretions from RSor influenza-virus infected children [36] . When comparing the patients with a severity index of 0 and those with an index of 1-4, TNF-\u03b1 had significantly higher levels of expression (P<0.001, Student's t-test). This could indicate that the presence of TNF-\u03b1 in the respiratory tract directly or indirectly affects the severity of disease in hMPV infected children. It is worth mentioning that the hMPV C t value was similar for the patients with severity index 0 and higher (S1 Table) , suggesting similar extent of viral replication in these patients.",

The mRNA expression was up-regulated for both hMPV A2-and B2-positive NPA samples. ISG54 is known to be induced by viruses downstream of pattern recognition receptors and IFNs [37] . The expression of ISGs is initiated by type I and type III interferons such as IFN-\u03b2 and IL-28. We did indeed find that these IFNs were up-regulated at mRNA and/or protein level in hMPV infected children. The functional effects and clinical involvement of ISG54 are largely unknown. Nevertheless, ISG54 has been shown to inhibit viral replication in vitro and in vivo [38] . Interestingly, mice lacking ISG54 have recently been shown to be subject to high mortality when infected with the mouse respiratory tract pathogen Sendai virus-a negative sense, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus [39] . This suggests that ISG54 has a protective function and limits pathogenesis in mice. However, in our study, we were not able to identify any differences with respect to length of hospitalization or severity index when comparing the groups of patients expressing ISG54 or not (P>0.05, Student's ttest), suggesting a general protective function of this cytokine in children.",

Interestingly, some patients showed distinct expression profiles with elevated levels of several genes involved in the inflammasome mediated immune-response. More specific, approximately 1/4 of the patients showed increased expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3. As mentioned earlier, the repressor gene I\u03baB\u03b1 expression is induced by NF-\u03baB activation [19] . NF-\u03baB induces mRNA expression of the potent proinflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 [40] . Further, increased level of NLRP3 mRNA expression is the initial essential step in activating the NLRP3-inflammasome. Taken together, the increased levels of NLRP3 mRNA in this group of children along with enhanced IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 mRNA expression and protein secretion could suggest that the NLRP3-inflammasome is activated to produce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the respiratory tract of these patients. Previously, it has been shown that influenza virus is able to activate the NLRP3-inflammasome in mice [14] . This was found to be critical for survival and reduction of viral titers in mice lung. Further, RSV was recently shown to activate the NLRP3-inflammasome in vitro using primary human lung epithelial cells [15] . Our results show that the hMPV infected children with a severity score exceeding zero more frequently exhibited elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 than children with severity score zero. This suggests a possible involvement of these genes in hMPV infected children with severe disease.",

These might experience different immune responses. To address this we compared children less than one year of age with older children. We found no differences in gene expression profiles (data not shown). In addition, the average age of children with severity score 1-4 was not significantly different from those with severity score zero (P = 0.28, Student's t-test), indicating that the youngest children where not more disposed to severe disease compared to the older. Of note, there was a difference in age distribution between hMPV-infected and control children. The controls were symptom-free and screened for the same airway pathogens as the patient samples, and no pathogens were detected. Hence, we would not anticipate that the inflammatory genes are expressed above a basal level in the controls. Further, to our knowledge, no studies so far have shown that basal expression is significantly different in children less than one year and older.",

For studies aimed to examine immune responses to a particular viral infection in vivo it is a challenge, especially in children, to obtain sufficient number of samples collected at similar conditions. In particular, interfering viral and bacterial co-infections are common. In our study population extensive viral analyses of each sample revealed that nearly half of the population had viral co-infections and were excluded from further analysis. In addition, bacterial infections were unlikely because most children had received one or more conjugated pneumococcal vaccinations, and only patients with maximal CRP levels less than 100 mg/L were included. Furthermore, we only included samples that were collected within the first week after onset of symptoms. Finally, separating the samples based on the two most frequent hMPV genotypes enabled us to see if there was a genotype-specific cytokine gene expression profile or differences in disease severity. This allowed us to study the initial host immune response towards particular hMPV genotypes, which extends current literature. However, our selection criteria limited the total number of patients that were eligible for our study. Consequently, it will be necessary to confirm our findings in other cohorts, in particular with respect to inflammasome-associated genes in children with severe RTI.",
