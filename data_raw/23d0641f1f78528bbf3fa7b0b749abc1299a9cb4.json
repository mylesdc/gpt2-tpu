            "text": "As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decisionmaking in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population. misinformation from the \"anti-vaxxer\" movement [8, [11] [12] [13] . Recently, there have been calls for a special government commission on vaccine safety, despite overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are both safe and effective [12, [14] [15] [16] .",

Following [37, 38] , we refer to this indirect protection as a herd effect. Although previously equated to the reduction in incidence in the unimmunized population [38], we quantify the herd effect of an intervention effort by estimating the number of infections averted per vaccine administered (or per individual social distancing action). The general phenomenon in which individual intervention actions reduce the risk of infection to others has also been called vaccination efficiency, vaccination effectiveness, herd immunity, and indirect protection [37] [38] [39] [40] .",

Depending on the decision model, they estimate either overall disease prevalence, their number of infected social contacts, or their fraction of infected social contacts. When the perceived threat is sufficiently high, they take a measure that immediately affords full protection for the duration of the epidemic. We compare the efficacy of these three different paradigms across a range of diseases in a realistically heterogeneous network, and show that the most naive model-simply counting one's infected contacts-affords the most epidemiological protection using the least amount of resources (e.g., vaccinations or economic costs associated with social distancing).",

However, such measures require population adherence and are often hindered by failure to take recommended actions [5] . Around the globe, for example, seasonal influenza vaccine coverage falls significantly below the 75% baseline recommended by the World Health Organization, but varies widely between countries and across age groups [6] . In the USA, 2015-2016 uptake was only 59.3% in children and 41.7% in adults [7] . For measles, routine childhood vaccination is declining in Texas and other areas of the United States where personal belief and other nonmedical vaccination exemptions are allowed [8] [9] [10] .

In all three models, we assume that individuals will vaccinate with a probability equal to their perceived real-time probability of being infected. For example, if an individual's perception of infection in the immediate future is 25%, then a precautionary measure will be taken with probability 0.25. The local count model comes closest to estimating actual risk of infection. Specifically, v lc is the probability that any currently infected contact will transmit disease to the focal node at some point during his or her infections period. This exactly estimates risk if all infected contacts were just infected and at the beginning of their infectious period, but overestimates risk if some are nearing recovery.

An H near one indicates that approximately one infection is averted for every vaccine given.

As disease begins to spread, individuals perceive increasing risks and vaccinate according to the decision model, thereby protecting themselves and interrupting potential chains of transmission to others. While all three strategies reduce the total number of infections, the local count strategy affords the greatest and most efficient protection of the three. Under the global prevalence strategy, perceived risk is homogeneous. As cases mount, the vaccination rate rises synchronously throughout the population, arguably resulting in too much too late vaccine coverage. The local strategies avert more infections with fewer vaccinations than the global strategy. As epidemics unfold, risk is both heterogeneous and dynamic, with some portions of the network experiencing greater forces of infection than others. Local decision-making allows earlier detection and response to increasing personal risk, and prevents unnecessary vaccination in lower risk settings, both prior to and following epidemic waves. The local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. By tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts, individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection. For example, compare a solitary individual with just two social contacts and a gregarious individual with 20. If they both have two infected contacts, then their risk of infection will be similar (assuming that time spent with each contact is sufficient for transmission). Under local count, their perceived risk and consequent vaccination probability will be identical; under local prevalence, the solitary individual will perceive higher risk (i.e., 100% of contacts infected) than the gregarious individual. Under all models, overall vaccine coverage increases as R 0 increases, with the global prevalence achieving near universal coverage by R 0 = 5.",

In general, the higher the degree of a node, the higher their risk for becoming infected and infecting others, and the greater the number of local infections they could potentially perceive when making vaccination decisions. Indeed, across all decision models, higher degree individuals vaccinate earlier, in terms of the fraction of the population infected at time of vaccination (Fig 4A, bottom) . However, the fraction of individuals vaccinated in each degree class does not necessarily increase with degree (Fig 4A, top) . Local count is the only strategy under which vaccination coverage monotonically increases with degree. Under global decision-making, coverage is inversely related to degree, and under local prevalence, coverage peaks for moderately connected individuals. By the time individuals choose to vaccinate under either of the two suboptimal strategies, their local risk of infection is already quite high (Fig 4A, middle) , particularly for more gregarious individuals. Although the vaccinating individuals are immediately protected, comparable individuals (of the same degree class and local risk) who stochastically fail to make the same low probability vaccination decision are likely to become infected. Consequently, the risk of infection increases steeply with degree under all models except local count (Fig 4B) . In a sensitivity analysis, we find that these qualitative results are robust to our assumptions about the efficacy of the vaccine, the time lag between an individual deciding to vaccinate and becoming protected against infection, the size of the network and the duration of the infectious period (S3 Fig). Finally, we consider the impact of the underlying contact network on the interplay between transmission and vaccination dynamics (Fig 5) . We compare our focal exponential network to a uniform random network in which all nodes have the same degree and a Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free network. The local count strategy robustly affords the most efficient population-level protection, averting the maximum number of infections (or nearly maximum in the case of the scale-free network and low R 0 ) with the fewest vaccines.

While such limitations should be formally analyzed, our simple analysis suggests that the best paradigm for averting infections also requires the fewest resources. For example, for a flu-like R 0 of two, compare the local count strategy, where individuals protect themselves as their number of infected friends and family climb, to the global strategy, where decisions are based on population prevalence. For every individual that takes action, almost two infections are averted under the local strategy whereas less than one infection is averted under the global strategy.

We assume that resources are unlimited, protection is immediate and complete, and adherence probabilities perfectly mirror perceived risks. Furthermore, depending on the decision paradigm, individuals fairly accurately estimate the infectiousness of the disease, their number or fraction of infected social contacts, or the population average risk of infection. The model also assumes that individuals are short-sighted and make reactive decisions to avert immediate threat. We conjecture that the qualitative results of our analysis-the optimality of assessing risk based on the numbers of infected friends and family-are robust for a large class of 'on-the-fly' interventions that afford relatively rapid protection in the heat of an epidemic, but may not apply to preventative measures taken early in an outbreak or those with long efficacy lags.

In reality, contacts can be highly heterogeneous, with household and health care contacts far more likely to transmit disease than casual social acquaintances. Our results should be robust when such heterogeneity is distributed randomly throughout the network. However, if individuals with more contacts tend to spend less time with each one, then epidemiological risk may be more homogeneous throughout the network and the advantage of the local decision strategies reduced. Although we do not model this scenario directly, we considered a homogeneous network where all individuals have the same number of contacts. This is roughly equivalent to mass action models that assume homogeneous contact rates and complete mixing [54] . The local strategies still prevail, but their relative efficiency is reduced, with far more vaccines required to achieve the same benefit ( Fig 5) . Conversely, in a network with greater heterogeneity (scale-free), the advantages of the local strategies are magnified.",

Perhaps individuals fall nicely into one of these three decision-making camps. More likely, individual risk assessments are constrained by historical inertia [21, 24, 34, 46, 72] , influenced by decisions of friends and family [1, 3, 10, 26, 28, 46] , and integrate information from a combination of local and global data sources of variable reliability. Realistic decision models, driven by sociological survey data, can elucidate vaccine campaign failures and identify key pressure points for increasing uptake. Second, how can we streamline intervention campaigns to achieve efficient, rather than universal, adherence? This study reminds us that more intervention is not necessarily better intervention. The decision paradigm that most reduced transmission also required the least resources. Given the simplicity of our model, we do not suggest that public health agencies should promote 'infection-counting'. Rather, we conclude that public health agencies should prioritize local disease surveillance and risk communications efforts and believe that data-driven models can be instrumental in designing effective outbreak information campaigns.",

Individuals decide to vaccinate based on one of three risk measures: The number of infected contacts (local count), the fraction of infected contacts (local prevalence), or the overall fraction infected (global prevalence). In this example, six of the 24 nodes are infected, yielding a global prevalence of 0.25. The white node towards the top has a single contact that happens to be infected; the white node towards the bottom has two of its five contacts infected.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225576.g001 Local risk perception enhances epidemic control PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225576 December 3, 2019 Global decision strategy.

(A) The proportion of individuals that are infected increases and then declines slightly as R 0 increases, across all three decision strategies.

            "text": "Vaccination decisions vary with degree. (A) For each degree class, we graph the proportion of individuals that vaccinate (top) along with the epidemiological situation at the time a node chooses to vaccinate in terms of the number of its infected neighbors (middle) and the overall disease prevalence in the population (bottom). Epidemiological risks-the chances of both becoming infected and infecting others-generally increase with degree. The local count strategy (light blue) is the only strategy for which the probability of vaccinating consistently increases with risk. Compared to the two other strategies, high degree individuals vaccinate earlier in terms of both local and global disease prevalence and, consequently, are less likely to become infected. (B) The number of individuals infected in each degree class under each decision strategy. The top of the curve indicates the number of individuals in each degree class (i.e., the underlying degree distribution) on a log scale. For each degree class, the stacked values indicate the expected number of individuals infected under the various strategies. The top of the gray area indicates the expected number of infections in the baseline scenario without vaccines; red indicates individuals expected to remain uninfected.Generally, local count has the lowest expected attack rate (light blue), followed by local prevalence (dark blue), and finally global prevalence. This ranking does not hold for the lowest degree individuals; instead, local prevalence has a lower expected attack rate than local count, as indicated by the dark blue line cutting through the light blue region.

Individuals determine their infection risk according to the original local count, local prevalence or global prevalence equations. However, they vaccinate if and when their perceived risk crosses a specified vaccination threshold, rather than vaccinating probabilistically according to risk. This decision threshold (x-axes) impacts the proportion of the population that (A) vaccinates (and are not infected), (B) becomes infected (with or without vaccination), and (C) remains susceptible, under the three different decision models. Y-axes values are means across 500 stochastic simulations, assuming R 0 = 5.

In both sets of graphs, the columns correspond to the three different strategies. Each point indicates a mean over 500 stochastic simulations that assume R 0 = 5. (A) The x-axes indicate the delay between an individual deciding to vaccinate and becoming immune to infection. Each simulation assumes an exponential network with N = 10000 individuals and that 80% of vaccinated individuals become protected against infection (the remaining 20% remain fully susceptible).
