Antigenic and genomic characterizations of the virus (isolate PHEV-JLsp09) were based on multiplex PCR and negative staining electron microscopy and sequence analysis of the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene. These piglets were diagnosed with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). Necropsy was performed on the piglets. Major pathological changes included meningeal hyperemia, meningeal hemorrhage and cortical hemorrhage. Minor changes were also observed in other organs. Histopathological changes included satellitosis and neuronophagia in the cerebral cortex. Mice were infected with the isolated virus. Their histopathological changes were similar to those symptoms observed in the piglets, exhibiting typical changes for non-suppurative encephalitis. Thus, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus mainly causes damage to the nervous system but also impacts other organs.",

PHEV predominantly affects 1-3 week-old piglets [1] , with clinical piglets vomiting, exhaustion and obvious neurological symptoms as the main feature. The mortality rate is up to 20-100% [2] . Since 1958, when the disease broke out in the Canadian province of Ontario for the first time [3] , many countries have reported about it. Serological test results proved that it is common for the pigs to be infected by PHEV [4, 5] , and the disease may have spread worldwide. In August 2006, the disease broke out in part of the pig farms in Argentina, resulting to 1226 deaths, with the morbidity rate up to 52.6% [1] . In China, an PHEV infection has been reported occurring in a pig farm in Beijing as early as in 1985, followed with reports from Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Taiwan, etc. The large-scale epidemics of HEV occurred in Taiwan in 1994 had a fatality rate of almost 100% [6] , resulting to serious economic losses. Serological survey conducted by foreign scholars revealed that PHEV infection in pigs is very common, with a worldwide distribution [4, 5] .",

Sick piglets often stayed together, had arched backs and did not like to walk. During late stages of the disease, they suffered from physical deterioration. Piglets with poor resistance would suffer from severe dehydration. Exhibiting difficulty in breathing and cyanosis, they would sink into comas and die. Piglets with better resistance would lose their appetite and soon became emaciated and died. In the current study, 28 piglets died within 20 days of birth. The only 10 surviving piglets were sent to the animal facility of our lab to be raised separately. Their clinical signs were significant increase of body temperature, lethargy, crowding together, eyes half-closed or lying on the ground showing sleepiness and loss of appetite. Nervous system signs of the diseased pigs included nervous whole body muscle convulsions, taking a dog-sitting position and weakness/fainting. During the late stage, diseased pigs wobbled and could not stand, their noses and feet were cyanotic and they discharged watery feces. Some of them lost their eyesight or had opisthotonos and nystagmus. Finally, they experienced breathing problems, lay on their sides exhausted and vomited. The only 10 surviving pigs sent to our lab for examination died within 3 days; the death rate of the piglets was 100%.",

Furthermore, this strain is closely related to BCoV and HCoV-OC43 from the group 2 coronaviruses. Influenza C virus is least similar to this virus ( Figure 4) .

            "text": "Results from the sequence alignment are consistent with the evolution process of the HE gene. The HE gene of coronavirus initially evolved from the HEF gene of influenza C virus [10] . During this process, the HE was transformed from a trimer into a dimer but maintained its acetylcholine esterase domain [10] . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of genes and antigens, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from the group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) are derived from a common ancestor [8] . Their HE genes continue to evolve in the three different hosts. PHEV independently evolved in North American and European regions. The viral strain found in the Siping area of Jilin Province in China is evolutionally closest to the HEV-67N stain (North American strain), indicating that this viral strain evolved from the PHEV from North America. In 1984, in a pig farm on the outskirts of Beijing, an HEV infection in the hybrid progenies of imported Landrace, Duroc, and Hampshire pigs was the first case reported in mainland China [11] . In 1985, an HEV infection in the progenies of American Duroc and Hampshire lean pigs occurred at a pig farm in Jilin Province. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics reported in that case were very similar to the HEV cases reported in Canada and United States in the 1980 s [12] . Therefore, we speculate that the viral strain isolated may be a mutated strain of HEV-67N, which was brought by the imported pigs and then spread and mutated in native pigs. The replication of vomiting and wasting type encephalomyelitis virus initially occurs in nasal mucosa, tonsil, lung, and in some cases, in small intestine. From these invasive sites, the virus reaches the medulla oblongata through the peripheral nervous system, subsequently extends to the entire brain stem and finally reaches the cerebrum and cerebellum. Vomiting is caused by viral replication in the vagal sensory ganglia, whereas wasting occurs because of the vomiting and the delayed stomach emptying. The porcine vomiting and wasting type hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis damages the pig nervous system, as indicated by non-suppurative encephalitis and edema. The pathological changes appear as neuron degeneration, nuclear dissolution and perivascular edema; there are also some instances of satellitosis and neuronophagia.",
