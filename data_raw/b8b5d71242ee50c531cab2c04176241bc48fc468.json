Although the DC-targeting strategy has attracted more attention, relevant studies on chicken are rare. Here, specific chicken bone marrow DC-binding peptides were selected using a phage display peptide library and confirmed through ELISA, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy. The peptide candidate SPHLHTSSPWER, named SP, was fused to the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) structural protein and protective antigen VP2. In vitro, the expression of DC markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, DEC205, and MHCII) and some cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and CXCLi1) by VP2-SP-stimulated DCs was significantly higher than that by DCs treated with the VP2-control peptide at 4 h (p < 0.001). In addition, an oral vaccine targeting DCs was generated using chicken-borne Lactobacillus saerimneri M11 (L. sae M11) to deliver VP2 fused with SP. Anti-IBDV mucosal and humoral immune responses were induced efficiently via oral administration, resulting in higher protective efficacy in the VP2-SP group than the VP2 group. Therefore, chicken DC targeting of IBDV protective antigen VP2 delivered by L. sae provides effective immune protection in chicken. Our study may promote research on the DC-targeting strategy to enhance the effectiveness of chicken vaccines.",

New and improved vaccines for avian diseases are urgently needed. Infectious bursal disease (IBD), an immunosuppressive disease, caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has always been a major concern for poultry farmers. IBDV can infect immature B-lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius (1) and result in vaccination failure and susceptibility of chickens to pathogens (2) . Both maternal immunity and active immunity can protect chicks against IBDV infection. Currently, live-attenuated and genetically engineered viral vectors that express the IBDV surface protein VP2 can be used to produce active immunity in chicks (3) . VP2 protein is a structural component of the capsid and protective antigen containing neutralizing epitopes. In addition, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, virus-like particle vaccines, and lactic acid bacteria vaccines are constantly evolving as vaccine candidates (4, 5) .",

            "text": "In the search for more effective candidates for treatment and prevention of diseases, dendritic cell (DC) targeting strategies have been proposed. DCs are specialized antigen-presenting cells that can capture, process, and present antigens to native T cells to initiate primary immune responses (6) . Because of the unique capacity mentioned above, DCs are usually utilized as the target of the antigen for generating efficient and strong immune responses, especially in the mammalian antitumor field (7) . One approach involves autologous DCs loaded with antigens ex vivo being re-injected into patients, and the other one targets DCs in situ by conjugating the vaccine with DC receptorspecific monoclonal antibodies (8, 9) . There is also an in situ approach of targeting antigens to DCs using nanoparticles to encapsulate antigens and adjuvants (10, 11) . A decade ago, specific DC-binding peptides screened by a phage display peptide library were identified (12) . Subsequently, oral mucosal vaccines targeting DCs were proposed, involving Lactobacillus delivering protective antigens fused with specific DC-targeting peptides to DCs (13) . The serum anti-antigen IgG titers, neutralizing antibodies, and the levels of IgA were all comparable with the historical adjuvanted vaccine administered subcutaneously (s.c.) (14) (15) (16) . Additionally, the Lactobacillus vaccine has tremendous advantages such as weak immunogenicity, similar to the immune-stimulating adjuvant, initiating both mucosal, and systemic immune responses, improving practicality for mass vaccination, and ease of production and administration (17) (18) (19) .",

Many immunity genes such as chemokines, chemokine receptors, and Toll-like receptors are different between the chicken and mammals. The chicken lacks lymph nodes, but has the bursa of Fabricius and cecum tonsil, which are absent in mammals (21, 22) .

For further verification, we observed the fluorescence of peptides binding to chBM-DCs and monocytes by fluorescence microscopy. Figures 2A,B show that the peptides hardly bound to the monocytes, as expected, and SP, AP, and AH showed better effects. SP can attach to the cell membrane dyed by DIL or be engulfed by chBM-DCs and be shown as yellow when merged ( Figure 2C ).

First, we constructed recombinant pCold plasmid in E coli. Figures 3A,B show that recombinant protein (about 90 kD) can be detected by western blotting and that it was mainly soluble. Purified VP2-SP and VP2ctrl were used for stimulating chBM-DCs in vitro. Nonstimulated chBM-DCs at the same point were used as calibrator, and \u03b2-actin was chosen as the reference gene (data not Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org shown). The up-regulation of chBM-DCs marker genes such as costimulatory molecules and MHCII indicates the maturation of DCs. Figure 3C shows that CD80, CD83, CD86, DEC205, and MHCII expressed by VP2-SP-stimulated chBM-DCs were significantly higher than in the VP2-ctrl group at 4 h (p < 0.001). However, with the prolongation of incubation time, at 6 and 8 h, there was almost no difference between the VP2-SP group and VP2-ctrl group (p > 0.05), except for CD80 (6 h). The cytokines released by DCs are involved in immune responses and have a critical effect on differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into Th1 and Th2. Figure 3D shows that the mRNA levels of Th1-associated cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12), were significantly higher in the VP2-SP groups than in the VP2ctrl groups at 4 h. IFN-\u03b3 has antiviral activities and can upregulate the expression of MHC antigens. IL-12 plays an important role in the activities of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), and chemokines (CXCLi1) mRNA levels were also higher in the VP2-SP groups than in the VP2-ctrl groups at 4 h. However, at 8 h for IL-12 and at 6 h for IL-1\u03b2, the levels of VP2-control groups were higher than those of the VP2-SP groups. Based on these results, we conclude that SP can direct the antigen VP2 to chBM-DCs, at least at the time point of 4 h.",

Therefore, L. sae M-11 with good colonization, especially in chicken cecum, which is close to the cecum tonsil, was applied as the delivery vector. Theoretically, recombinant L. sae M-11 can adhere to the intestinal epithelium to compete with pathogenic bacteria for binding epitopes and propagate in the chicken intestine. In fact, only a small quantity of immunogen of interest can penetrate the gut wall to be taken up by APCs (35) . To increase the bioavailability of the immunogen in chickens, the DC-targeting peptide was screened in this study. Binding peptides were obtained through the phage display library, which has been used in screening the binding peptides of proteins, cells, or organs in vivo (36) (37) (38) . However, there was no obvious enrichment after four rounds of screening because of the complex components of the cell surface. Although peptides are displayed randomly in the original phage library, the frequency of each amino acid is different. For these reasons, we used various experiments to verify that the peptide named SP has more potential for targeting chBM-DCs. Of these, antigen fused with SP can regulate markers of chBM-DCs and some cytokines at early times in vitro, and this implied that SP can direct VP2 to DCs. Then, a live recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine with SP was constructed to detect whether the targeting peptide can work in the chicken intestinal tract.",

Antigens can be processed and presented by DCs to lymphocytes directly or migrate into other lymphoid tissue for antigen presentation.

T and B cells activated by DCs then move to the periphery to trigger a specific immune response against the pathogen challenge (40). This study indicated that compared with that induced by the pPG-VP2 group, recombinant Lactobacillus with chBM-DC-targeting peptide can promote more rapid immunity at both mucosal and systemic levels. With the challenge of very virulent IBDV, higher Th1/Th2-associated IL-2, Th2-associated IL-4, and Th1associated IFN-\u03b3 in vaccine groups than those in the control group revealed that cellular immunity was initiated.

Our study showed that the peptide named SP derived from a phage display peptide library can bind to chBM-DCs in vitro and assist antigens with promoting systemic and mucosal immune responses via fused expression in a Lactobacillus system. Further research should identify which receptor on the DCs was targeted and relevant mechanisms of initiating desired immune responses.
