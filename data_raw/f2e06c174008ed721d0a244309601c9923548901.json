Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus.",

Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV.",

MARV belongs to family Filoviridae, which also includes the highly pathogenic Ebola virus (EBOV). The first documented evidence of MARV was in 1967 in laboratory workers and scientists at facilities in Germany and the former Yugoslavia via infected monkeys that were imported from north-western Uganda [1] . MARV is a zoonotic virus and has been detected in both infected and healthy Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in endemic areas in Africa; therefore, R. aegyptiacus are considered as its natural host. This is most likely the reason that MARV outbreaks have been mostly associated with individuals such as mine workers or tourists in the regions that these bats inhabit [2] . The typical symptoms include general malaise, acute fever, abdominal cramping, bleeding disorders, and shock [3] . Similar to its highly pathogenic cousin EBOV that is the cause of a recent ongoing outbreak, MARV also causes fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates with a fatality rate of up to 90 %. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed understanding of replication and evolution of this virus [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "It is known that the genetic code shows redundancy and most of the amino acids can be translated by more than one codon. This redundancy represents a key step in modulating the efficiency and accuracy of protein production while maintaining the same amino acid sequence of the protein. Alternative codons within the same group that codes for the same amino acid are often termed 'synonymous' codons, although their corresponding tRNAs might differ in relative abundance in cells and in the speed by which they are recognized by the ribosome. However, the synonymous codons are not randomly chosen within and between genomes, which is referred to as codon usage bias [6, 7] . This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and viruses. Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that could influence codon usage patterns, including mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein, and the external environment [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Moreover, considering the virus's genome size and other viral features, such as dependence on host's machinery for key processes, including replication, protein synthesis, and transmission, compared with prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect overall viral survival, fitness, evasion from host's immune system, and evolution [11, 14] . Therefore, knowledge of codon usage in viruses can reveal information about molecular evolution as well as improve our understanding of the regulation of viral gene expression and aid in vaccine design, where efficient expression of viral proteins may be required to generate immunity.",

Non-synonymous codons and termination codons were excluded from the calculation. The reference datasets for H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus were obtained from the Codon Usage Database [29] . The correlation analysis between CAI and ENC values was performed to determine the relative influence of mutation and selection. If selection is preferred over mutation, the correlation (r) between the two quantities should be very high (r \u2192 \u22121). In contrast, if mutation force is more important, r should approach 0 (no correlation) [30, 31] .",

In the plot, the regression coefficient against P 3 is regarded as the mutation-selection equilibrium coefficient and the evolutionary speed of the mutation pressure and natural selection pressure is expressed as the slope of a regression line. If all of the points lie along the diagonal distribution, no significant difference exists at the three codon positions, and there is no or weak external selection pressure.

It has previously been shown that codon usage bias, or preference for one type of codon over another, can be greatly influenced by overall genomic composition [42] . Nucleotide composition analysis showed that A and U nucleotides constitute the majority of overall nucleotide composition in MARV genomes ( Table 1) . The RSCU analysis also showed that MARV genomes exhibit greater codon usage bias toward A-and U-ended codons (Table 2) . Therefore, once it is established that there is codon bias toward A-and U-ended codons in MARV genomes, we next determined the extent of this bias within and in between different MARV isolates. This was accomplished by ENC analyses. In the case of MARV, the mean ENC value was found to be 54.2 in MARV coding sequences, which indicates slightly biased, relatively stable and conserved ARO aromaticity; NS non-significant (P > 0.05) *represents 0.01 < P < 0.05 **represents P < 0.01 Table 6 Summary of correlation analysis between the first two principal axes and relative abundance of dinucleotides in MARV genomes [46] , and West Nile virus (ENC: 53.81) [11] . A possible explanation given for this is that the low codon bias of RNA viruses might be advantageous for efficient replication in host cells by reducing the synthesis machinery competition between the virus and host with potentially distinct codon preferences. Whether the same holds true for MARVs as well, warrants further investigations. However, this can be attributed to the fact that MARVs maintain low yet surviving replication rate within in its natural host, R. aegyptiacus without causing any disease conditions [47] . Therefore, it seems that evolution of low codon bias within MARV coding sequences have enabled it to successfully maintain its survival cycle within both of its hosts each of which possess distinct codon usage preferences from that of MARV (Table 2) .",

Moreover, MARV isolates formed three separate PCA clusters following distribution on principal axes. The clustering of diverse MARV lineages that are separated by thousands of miles within a single cluster as well as clustering of closely related lineages into different clusters highlights an important role of the mobility of MARV's natural host, R. aegyptiacus. This also indicates that the isolates of MARV might have independently evolved in three clusters after diverging from a common ancestor that potentially originated from DRC, based on inclusion of DRC isolates in all three clusters. Moreover, it appears that the geographical diversity and associated factors, such as presence of natural host within region of infection, climatic features, and host susceptibility, have contributed to shaping codon usage in MARV genomes.",

However, it has previously been shown that, although overall RSCU could reveal the codon usage pattern for genomes, it may hide the codon usage variation among different genes in a genome [48] , thereby indicating that composition frequencies of nucleotides are not always the only factor associated with codon usage patterns. The ENC plot is widely used to determine codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. It has been postulated that the ENC-plot of genes for which codon choice is constrained only by compositional constraints or mutation pressure will lie on the continuous curve of the predicted ENC values [32] . When the ENC and GC 3S values of MARVs were plotted, it was found that although none of the isolates fell on the expected continuous curve but clustered closely below the curve, thereby showing major influence of mutation pressure on MARV codon usage patterns and of natural selection to some extent. Besides that, it has also been reported previously that both mutation pressure and natural selection can influence the overall ENC and it might not be a robust index to show the relative contribution of mutation and selection on structuring codon usage patterns. Moreover, the codon usage bias of base composition of the genes of a species with A/U biased genomes will behave differentially than those species with G/C biased genomes, as such, ENC-GC 3S plot might be potentially misleading. In contrast, CAI is suggested as the most robust index for showing the influence of natural selection on codon usage patterns of such genes [27, 30, 31, 49] . CAI is regarded as a measure of gene expression and can be used to assess the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts. It has been postulated that the highly expressed genes exhibit a stronger bias for particular codons compared with genes that are less expressed. Compared with ENC, which is another way of calculating codon usage bias and measures deviation from a uniform bias (null hypothesis), CAI measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of genes [27] . If CAI value is high, then codon usage bias is extremely high and the influence of natural selection is prevailing. CAI values were calculated for MARV genes separately for both of its hosts. MARV genes showed higher CAI values for H. sapiens (0.712) as compared to R. aegyptiacus (0.534) indicating that natural selection from both hosts have influenced the codon usage patterns of MARV. Furthermore, comparative analysis of CAI values between MARV and its hosts suggests that MARV genes have optimized their codon usage patterns to utilize the translational resources of H. sapiens more efficiently than that of R. aegyptiacus. A higher CAI values of MARV genes for H. sapiens represents an interesting evolutionary step which might have supported MARV to turn out to be a highly pathogenic virus for H. sapiens and at the same time remaining completely harmless for its natural host, R. aegyptiacus.",

            "text": "Among multiple influencing factors, mutation pressure and natural selection are considered the two major factors that shape codon usage patterns [50] . A general mutation pressure that affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage among certain RNA viruses [42] . The ENC and CAI analyses highlighted the influence of both mutation pressure and natural selection on codon usage patterns of MARV genes. In order to determine the share of each factor on evolution of MARV codon usage patterns, a neutrality plot analysis was performed which showed that influence of mutation pressure dominates over natural selection. Furthermore, we also examined the influence of mutation pressure on MARV codon usage via correlation and linear regression analyses between different nucleotide compositional constraints, ENC, and principal axes. Strong and significant correlations were observed, which indicates a dominant influence of mutation pressure. This was further supported when these indices were plotted against the first two principal axes via PCA, and significant strong correlations were observed. However, in the case of MARV genomes, involvement of factors other than mutation pressure such as natural selection cannot be ignored because nucleotide base compositions showed variation, distribution of MARV isolates were although close to but still below the expected curve on ENC plot, and there was a weak codon bias. A weak codon usage bias may be caused by natural selection when the viruses try to adapt to the host cell [51] [52] [53] . It has been suggested that, if synonymous codon usage bias is affected by mutation pressure alone, then the frequency of nucleotides A and U/T should be equal to that of C and G at the synonymous codon third position [53] . To test this phenomena in MARV, PR2 biasness plot analysis was performed on four fold degenerate codons. The occurrence frequency of AU and GC nucleotides at the synonymous codon third position was not found to be equal and AU biased preference was observed in four fold degenerate codons of MARV genes which indicates the potential influence of natural selection on codon usage patterns of MARV genes. In addition to this, correlation analysis between principal axes and GRAVY and ARO also revealed that, although natural selection has influenced MARV codon usage patterns to some extent, it is much weaker compared with mutation pressure.",

            "text": "Dinucleotide abundance has been reported to influence overall codon usage bias in several organisms, including DNA and RNA viruses [37, 54, 55] . Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which is a type of intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR), recognizes unmethylated CpGs, which leads to activation of several immune response pathways [56] . The vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a signature of infection, and CpG underrepresentation in RNA viruses is exclusively observed in vertebrate viruses; therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system that recognizes CpGs when in an RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) and triggers immune responses [57] . In contrast to the CpG usage of + ssRNA viruses that are greatly influenced by their hosts and because of which + ssRNA viruses mimic their hosts' CpG usage, -ssRNA viruses do not produce DNA intermediates during the replication of their genome. As a result, CpGs are under-represented, independent of the infected host or their phylogenetic relationship. The under-representation of CpG in -ssRNA viruses is therefore due to the U/A mutation bias in overall genomic composition that further indicates a dominating effect of mutation pressure [54, 58] . In the case of MARV, none of the dinucleotides were found at the expected frequencies and were also markedly underrepresented. As inferred from the RSCU analysis, codons containing CpG and UpA dinucleotides were also underrepresented and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids within MARV genomes. These results collectively indicate that, although dinucleotide representation has some influence over the codon usage of MARVs, the overall influence is not strong because of exceptions among dinucleotide frequencies and selection of preferred codons in MARV genomes.",

            "text": "It has been previously shown that, among many other factors, the codon usage patterns of viruses are also affected by its hosts [59] . For example, the codon usage pattern of poliovirus is reported to be mostly coincident with that of its host [60] , whereas the codon usage pattern of hepatitis A was reported to be antagonistic to that of its host [61] . Alternatively, some viruses exhibit a mix of both coincidence and antagonism, such as the HCV [46] , enterovirus 71 [9] , and CHIKV [44] . However, MARV showed almost complete antagonism to both of its hosts, as inferred from the RSCU analysis with the exception for a common preferred codon for arginine between MARV and H. sapiens (Table 2) . A recent codon usage analysis in the EBOV, which is also from the same family as MARV and spread via bats, reported similar antagonism of RSCU toward its host, H. sapiens [43] . It has been proposed that the coincident portions of codon usage among viruses and their hosts could enable the corresponding amino acids to be efficiently translated, whereas the antagonistic portions of codon usage may enable viral proteins to be properly folded, although the translation efficiency of the corresponding amino acids might decrease [46] . Whether the same holds true for MARV warrants further investigations. In addition to the RSCU comparison analysis, we also performed a similarity index analysis to determine which of the MARV hosts have a dominant influence over its RSCU patterns. Evidence of selection pressure from both hosts was detected which is in agreement to the CAI analysis; however, level of pressure was significantly different. Compared with H. sapiens, R. aegyptiacus have a more profound effect on shaping MARV RSCU patterns, as inferred from the similarity index analysis. As R. aegyptiacus is consider as the natural reservoir and host for MARV, it makes sense that virus has evolved its genomic features to a stable level in order to better adapt to its primary host's environment. It has also been recently suggested that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this hostvirus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts [47] .",
