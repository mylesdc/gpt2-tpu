The freeze-thaw technique was used for virus harvesting. EBOV titers were calculated using tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays done in a microtiter format using four replicates at 10-fold serial dilutions (10 -2 to 10 -8 ). After an 11-day incubation period at 37 \u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin overnight, and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 15 min. Virus titers were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. All work with filoviruses was performed in the biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility of the Galveston National Laboratory.",

RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples of purified RNA were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. One microgram of each RNA sample was reverse transcribed using the iScript reverse transcription supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with an RNase inhibitor and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's instruction. Detection of EBOV was performed using a qPCR TaqMan assay that amplified an 80-bp fragment of the receptor binding and fusion glycoprotein gene fragment of EBOV-Zaire. The primers used were: 5\u02b9-TTT TCA ATC CTC AAC CGT AAG GC-3\u02b9 (forward) and 5\u02b9-CAG TCC GGT CCC AGA ATG TG-3\u02b9 (reverse), and probe FAM-CAT GTG CCG CCC CAT CGC TGC-BHQ1. cDNA samples were run on the Stratagene Mx3000P thermal cycler in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL containing 1x TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix, 1 \u03bcmol of each primer, 0.1 \u03bcmol probe, and 100 ng template. The thermal profile for the reaction was: 50 \u00b0C for 15 min, 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 s, 60 \u00b0C for 20 s, then 1 cycle of 40 \u00b0C for 30 s. In each qPCR run, 10-fold serial dilutions of a standard (60,000 EBOV-Zaire Mayinga particles/\u03bcL of RNA) were included to confirm the sensitivity of the qPCR method, and noninfected cells (mock) were used as a negative control. A standard curve was used to convert the threshold cycle value (Cq) to the number of RNA copies per milliliter of sample. For Marburg virus (MARV) detection, primers MN FP and MN RP, and probe MN P were used as previously described [2] .
