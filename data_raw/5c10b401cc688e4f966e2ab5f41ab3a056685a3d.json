The latter is formed by three subunits named PB1, PB2 and PA for influenza A and B viruses and PB1, PB2 and P3 for influenza C virus, respectively. In the nucleus of infected cells, viral messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is initiated with capped RNA primers that are cleaved from host cell mRNAs (capsnatching mechanism), and terminates 17 to 22 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the genomic vRNA template 5' end at a stretch of five to seven uridine residues used as a polyadenylation signal. Genomic vRNA replication requires a full-length positive-sense RNA template (complementary RNA or cRNA), and both cRNA and vRNA syntheses are primer-independent [2] .",

In a type A backbone (Figure 1 ), no virus harbouring the type C 5'end (5'C/3'C and 5'C/3'A) was rescued. Only viruses with a type A 5' end (5'A/3'A and 5'A/3'C) could be rescued, but a C-to-U mutation in the 3'C proximal sequence was systematically observed at nucleotide 5 (5'A/3'C(C5U)). Introduction of this reverse substitution into the wild-type 5'A/3'A construct (to generate 5'A/3'A(U5C)) systematically led to a wild-type uracil reversion, confirming the importance of this position. Minigenome experiments previously showed that this position did not modify the transcription/replication processes [10] . Interestingly, this mutation in 5'A/3'C, leading to 5'A/3'C(C5U), restored a proximal panhandle sequence identical to that of the wild-type 5'A/3'A. To demonstrate the necessity of the type specific proximal panhandles to recover viruses, chimeric heterotypic ends were created to include proximal panhandles homotypic of the reverse genetics backbone. Both type A and C viruses with 5' and 3' modified NS ends (5'C/3'C-proxA and 5'A/3'A-proxC, respectively) were rescued as efficiently as wild-type viruses (Figure 1 ). The fact that the proximal panhandle of the unsuccessful constructs is not homotypic strongly suggested that a homotypic proximal panhandle is required.",

Levels of mRNA and vRNA were analyzed by RT-qPCR [23] at 6 hours post infection (h.p.i.) at high m.o.i., using RT primers specific for mRNA or vRNA ( Figure 3A ). Crossing point values were used to evaluate the relative level of both processes, by calculating an mRNA/vRNA ratio. Compared to wild-type 5'A/ 3'A, significant differences (p<0.05) were found only for 5'A/ 3'C(C5U), but not for 5'C/3'C-proxA. Interestingly, the CpmRNA/CpvRNA ratio for 5'A/3'C(C5U) was higher than for wild-type 5'A/3'A for all segments, meaning that either more vRNA or less mRNA was synthesized for 5'A/3'C(C5U). The sole difference between 5'A/3'C(C5U) and wild-type 5'A/3'A viruses being the 3' distal extremity of the NS segment suggested that the level of NS encoded proteins (i.e. NS1 or/and NS2/NEP) was affected at early stages of infection for this virus (5'A/3'C(C5U)). Western-blot was used to evaluate the amount of NS encoded proteins two hours before the observed effect. The amount of NP protein was used to normalize the results. At 4 h.p.i. at high m.o.i., only 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) showed a clear increase in the production of NS1 protein, as indicated by a higher NS1/NP ratio ( Figure 3B ). The putative roles of the proteins encoded by the NS segment in viral transcription and replication have been documented: (i) inactivation of NS1 protein reduces the amount of all vRNAs without affecting the amount of mRNAs [27] ; (ii) NS1 protein counteracts the effect of a polymerase regulating factor, possibly hnRNP-F [28] , that inhibits influenza virus full-length RNA synthesis [29] ; and (iii) NS2/NEP protein reduces transcription and increases replication [30] . The latter role of NS2/NEP could be indirect by stimulating the synthesis of virus-derived small viral RNAs, whose depletion was shown to reduce vRNA synthesis [31] . Thus, the decreased mRNA/ vRNA ratio observed at 6 h.p.i. at high m.o.i. could reflect an increase in replication, which would be consistent with the higher viral titer for 5'A/3'C(C5U) we observed at that time point (5x10 5 vs 1.6x10 7 PFU/ml for wild-type and 5'A/3'C(C5U), respectively).",

Such a trend, but no significant difference, in NS mRNA quantification after normalization relative to GAPDH was indeed observed between two and four h.p.i. (data not shown). The difference in the base-pairing strength of the distal panhandle formed by the heterotypic extremities in 5'A/3'C(C5U) compared to wild-type, evaluated by scores calculated based on the number and nature of the base-pairs (Figure 1) , could favour the attachment of the polymerase. The stability of the duplex formed by the 5' and 3' ends was indeed shown to be an important parameter for polymerase binding [32] . A weaker distal panhandle for 5'A/ 3'C(C5U) (score 7.39 vs 10.74 for wild-type) could facilitate polymerase binding and/or transcription initiation, resulting in slightly more NS mRNA synthesized. This is further supported by the results for the 5'C/3'C-proxA virus, whose distal panhandle base-pairing score is identical to that of wild-type 5'A/3'A (Figure 1) , and for which NS1 expression levels ( Figure   3B ) and mRNA/vRNA ratios ( Figure 3A ) were similar to those obtained for wild-type.",

Results were expressed as the mean of mRNA/vRNA Cp (crossing-point) ratios calculated on data obtained from 12 independent qPCRs (corresponding to two infections, two independent cDNA syntheses per infection and three independent qPCRs for each cDNA). Statistics were performed using the ANOVA test. Black bars: wild-type 5'A/3'A; hatched bars: 5'A/3'C(C5U); grey bars: 5'C/ 3'C-proxA. (B) Levels of NP and NS1 proteins after infection with the rescued influenza A viruses. Four hours after MDCK infection at a high m.o.i. (2 PFU/cell), cell lysates were analyzed by Western-blot for viral NS1 and NP proteins and for \u03b2-actin as cellular control. Following chemiluminescence acquisition with a G. Box (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK), band densities for viral proteins were determined using GeneTools software (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK), and were used to calculate NS1/NP ratios for each virus. Due to the high levels of viral protein expression during infection, protein extracts were diluted in uninfected cellular extracts prior to electrophoresis. Results are from one representative assay out of three independent infections. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081550.g003 segments. It is interesting to note that comparison of the distal panhandles formed by the extremities of each segment for a given virus shows differences in base-pairing scores (data not shown). In particular, regardless of the influenza A virus subtype, the distal panhandle of the HA segment was systematically the weakest one. It would be interesting to determine to what extent the distal panhandle base-pairing strength may have an impact on HA expression levels and consequently influence the HA/NA molecule ratio found at the virion surface [33] .",
