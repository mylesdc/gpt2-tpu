It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA. Here, we identified ANXA2 as a RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds IBV (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot RNA. We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an antiviral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs.",

Programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting is the most widely used translational recoding mechanism of many viruses [1] . Many viruses employ frameshifting during replication and generate the frameshifted protein critical for efficient viral replication [2, 3, 4] . In the case of retroviruses such as HIV-1, ribosomal frameshifting is required for the expression of protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase. For most other viruses, including coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), frameshifting generates RNA dependent RNA polymerases. Since translation is a complex process involving many regulatory factors in addition to the ribosome, binding of RNA binding protein (RBP) at a nearby RNA signal could affect RNA conformation and somehow redirect the translational machinery [5, 6] . Therefore, the identification of RBPs involved in frameshifting is important in elucidating the regulatory mechanism for RNA translation.",

RNA pseudoknots are structural elements found in almost all classes of RNA, which are now recognized as a widespread motif with diverse biological functions [2] . For example, viral pseudoknots in non-coding regions act in the regulation of translation initiation and in template recognition by viral replicase. In contrast, when pseudoknots are present in coding regions, they regulate translation elongation and termination, leading to ribosomal frameshifting [10] . It is not clear whether ribosomal frameshifting occurs through the interaction of ribosome or any RBPs, or due to the intrinsic nature of the pseudoknot RNA.",

Recently, its potential role in RNA metabolism was proposed because it was found to bind some mRNA transcripts, such as c-myc, collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylasea (I) and its own mRNA [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . Since ANXA2 binds 39untranslated region (UTR) of these mRNAs, it was suggested to be involved in mRNA localization and translational regulation [15, 17] . Interestingly, ANXA2 is reported to be the most abundant proteins in cytoskeleton bound polyribosome fraction and also associated with mRNAs [17] . These findings led to the suggestion that ANXA2 may bind to some RNA elements involved in translational regulation. In fact, aberrant expression of ANXA2 is somehow related to the carcinogenesis of human cancers, because it has been shown to be clearly absent in some prostate cancers and highly overexpressed in other human cancers [18, 19, 20] .",

In addition, RNA was in vitro transcribed in the presence of 4-thio UTP that could serve as crosslinker for directly interacting proteins. IBV pseudoknot RNA was incubated with cell extracts from human lung fibroblast IMR90, which is a natural host cell for the infection of IBV. The complex was irradiated with 365 nm UV light to directly crosslink interacting proteins to 4-thio UTP incorporated IBV pseudoknot RNA.

Comparison of the bands from wild-type pseudoknot RNA bound to those from the mutant demonstrated that most of the bound proteins were common for two RNA molecules ( Figure 2A ).

Moreover, wild-type IBV pseudoknot RNA tended to bind more than mutant IBV RNA did ( Figure 3A ). We tested whether such binding was dependent on the presence of calcium, given that ANXA2 is a calcium binding protein. However, calcium did not cause any change in the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA (data not shown). We performed a RNA-EMSA to analyze the ANXA2 binding pattern ( Figure 3B ). RNA-protein complexes were resolved using native polyacrylamide gels. Only a single shifted band was generated in the presence of ANXA2 protein but not with the same amount of the GST protein ( Figure 3B ). We also confirmed whether ANXA2 bound to wild-type IBV pseudoknot RNA in the cells. Through the RNA-immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that ANXA2 specifically interacted with wild-type IBV pseudoknot RNA but not with mutant IBV RNA in LNCaP and HEK293T cells ( Figure 3C and 3D).

We constructed dual luciferase reporters controlled by IBV frameshifting sequences with or without pseudoknot RNA ( Figure 4A ). Frameshifting of the dual luciferase reporter expressed firefly luciferase as well as Renilla luciferase ( Figure 4B ), so the frameshifting could be assessed by the ratio between these two proteins as well as by control reporters. Control reporters with either in frame or no expression of firefly luciferase used as positive or negative controls, respectively. To test how ANXA2 regulates the frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA, we first overexpressed ANXA2 protein in the presence of the reporters and measured the luciferase activities. Transfection of FLAGtagged ANXA2 in HEK293T cells reduced the relative frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA up to 40% ( Figure 5A ). Since HEK293T cells possess an endogenous protein, overexpression of FLAG-ANXA2 might generate additional exogenous ANXA2 protein. To assess more definitively the inhibitory effect of ANXA2 on the frameshifting of IBV pseudoknot RNA, we used a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which does not express endogenous ANXA2 protein in the cells. More significant reduction of the relative frameshifting efficiency was shown in LNCaP cells, which likely resulted from the overexpression of ANXA2 without any basal level expression of the protein ( Figure 5B ). Conversely, we showed that the downregulation of the ANXA2 by three independent knockdown greatly increased the relative frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA in HEK293T cells ( Figure 5D and 5E). Targeting sequences of shRNA and siRNA in ANXA2 mRNA were diagrammed in Figure 5C . By independent experiments either with shRNA expression vector or with siRNA duplex, we clearly demonstrated that frameshifting efficiency was dramatically increased by ANXA2 knockdown. These data clearly indicated that ANXA2 controls the frameshifting efficiency in the cells, which could act as the cellular inhibitor against the frameshifting of viral RNA translation.",

Here, we identify ANXA2 as the regulator of ribosomal frameshifting. Since it was previously reported that ANXA2 binds RNA and regulates RNA localization [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] , our proteomic identification of ANXA2 as an IBV pseudoknot RNA binding protein leads us to propose that it might regulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA translation. As shown in Figure 5 , knockdown of ANXA2 increased the frameshifting efficiency up to seven times, whereas overexpression of ANXA2 significantly down-regulated the frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA. These results clearly show that ANXA2 reduces IBV viral frameshifting in some way, probably by binding to pseudoknot RNA. Since the frameshifting of IBV generates RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is critical for successful viral replication, the protein that inhibits frameshifting must be a major antiviral regulator in eukaryotic cells. However, many questions remain to be answered. These include the exact mechanism of ANXA2 action on IBV frameshifting, possible involvement of ANXA2 on frameshifting of other viral RNA and unexplored functions of RNA metabolism on many other pseudoknot containing cellular RNA.",

Since the first discovery of pseudoknot structure in 39-UTR of Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV), numerous viruses have been reported to contain pseudoknot RNA [7, 8, 9] . Many other cellular RNAs, such as rRNA, mRNA, tmRNA, catalytic RNA, telomerase RNA, RNA components of ribonucleoprotein complex and many artificially selected RNA aptamers also form pseudoknot structures [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] . A pseudoknot is not only a structural element of RNA, but also a functional regulator of RNA. As mentioned previously, RNA pseudoknot located in the coding region of virus is involved in the -1 ribosomal frameshifting of viral RNA translation, and pseudoknot in 59-UTR in some cases regulates the initiation of viral RNA replication [28] . Since mutational analysis revealed drastic changes of ribosomal frameshifting efficiency upon disruption of pseudoknot structure, this structure is likely to be kept intact in addition to the slippery site and spacer region for efficient frameshifting [29] . Recent advances in RNA bioinformatics broaden the possibility of finding pseudoknot structure from RNA sequences and predicting threedimensional structures of the RNA molecules [30, 31, 32] .",

            "text": "The detailed mechanism of pseudoknot function on frameshifting is being intensively studied. Recent data suggests that the mechanical strength of the pseudoknot structure is correlated with ribosomal frameshifting, with pausing of ribosome itself is not sufficient for frameshifting [33, 34, 35, 36] . While still contentious, several reports describe pseudoknot binding protein factors. For example, 102-kDa RNA binding protein and eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eEF1) bind RNA pseudoknot of 39-UTR in the Tobacco Mosaic Virus genome [37, 38] . Recently, it was also reported that replicase gene product of mouse coronavirus interacts with its own RNA pseudoknot [29] . Also, we present data showing that ANXA2 ; Lanes 4-7 contain GST-ANXA2 protein (0.5, 2, 5 and 10 mM, respectively). (C) RNA immunoprecipitation assay. LNCaP cells were cotransfected with reporters (wild-type or mutant IBV pseudoknot plasmid Wild-type or mutant) and ANXA2 expression plasmids (Flag-vector or Flag-ANXA2). After formaldehyde fixation, immunoprecipitations were performed with FLAG-M2 agarose beads. Bound RNA was extracted from the immune complexes and analyzed by RT-PCR (left panel) and qRT-PCR (right panel). PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. ANXA2 mRNA and IBV PK RNA were also shown as an expression and input controls. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-ANXA2 was confirmed by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-Flag antibody. In the qRT-PCR data, wild-type PK RNA (WT) in binds pseudoknot RNA and inhibits ribosomal frameshifting of IBV. Even though it is necessary to determine the exact mode of action for ANXA2 on ribosomal frameshifting, evidence is accumulating concerning the role of ANXA2 in translational regulation. For example, ANXA2 is associated with active and inactive mRNAs, polyribosomes and many ribosomal subunit proteins [12, 19] . In addition, the receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK1), which resides in ribosome acting as the signal regulator of translation, also interacts with ANXA2 [39] .",
