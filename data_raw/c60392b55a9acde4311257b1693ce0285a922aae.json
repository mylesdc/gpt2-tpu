            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) was first discovered in 1947 in Africa. Since then, sporadic ZIKV infections of humans have been reported in Africa and Asia. For a long time, this virus was mostly unnoticed due to its mild symptoms and low fatality rates. However, during the 2015-2016 epidemic in Central and South America, when millions of people were infected, it was discovered that ZIKV causes microcephaly in the babies of mothers infected during pregnancy. An examination of the M and C proteins of the ZIKV shell using the disorder predictor PONDR VLXT revealed that the M protein contains relatively high disorder levels comparable only to those of the yellow fever virus (YFV). On the other hand, the disorder levels in the C protein are relatively low, which can account for the low case fatality rate (CFR) of this virus in contrast to the more virulent YFV, which is characterized by high disorder in its C protein. A larger variation was found in the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the C protein of various ZIKV strains. Strains of African lineage are characterized by higher PIDs. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, laboratories have also previously shown that strains of African origin have a greater potential to inflict higher fetal morbidity than do strains of Asian lineage, with dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) having the least potential. Strong correlations were found between the potential to inflict fetal morbidity and shell disorder in ZIKV (r 2 = 0.9) and DENV-2 (DENV-2 + ZIKV, r 2 = 0.8). A strong correlation between CFR and PID was also observed when ZIKV was included in an analysis of sets of shell proteins from a variety of flaviviruses (r 2 = 0.8). These observations have potential implications for antiviral vaccine development and for the design of cancer therapeutics in terms of developing therapeutic viruses that penetrate hard-to-reach organs.",

This was followed by a full-blown epidemic in Latin and Central America in 2015/2016, with approximately 1.5 million estimated cases in Brazil alone [3, 4] . With such a large number of infections, physicians were able to notice exceptionally large numbers of microcephaly cases among the babies of women who were infected by ZIKV during their pregnancies [1, 3, 5, 6] . Microcephaly refers to a condition in which a baby is born with a smaller than usual brain and head. Further studies of ZIKV in laboratories using animal models confirmed the ability of ZIKV to penetrate both the placenta and the brain [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Similarly to YFV and DENV, ZIKV is also spread by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti [2,6,14]. A flavivirus genome encodes a polyprotein that includes 10 proteins, three structural proteins (capsid (C), precursor membrane (PrM), and envelope (E) proteins), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) [14, 15] . The immature virion contains an abundance of PrM protein, which is cleaved during maturation, and only M remains in a mature virion [16, 17] . In a mature virion, the outermost shell contains E protein, which is followed by a shell containing M and C proteins. In an immature virion, however, both E and PrM are contained in the outer shell [16, 17] .",

Furthermore, previous studies have found correlations between virulence and the shell disorder of DENV and flaviviruses, although the sets used in those studies did not include ZIKV proteins [2, 14] . The shell proteins examined were M and C proteins, and the highly pathogenic YFV was found to contain the highest levels of shell disorder among the fairly large variety of flaviviruses looked at. Although ZIKV shell disorder has also been inspected in other studies, a comparative analysis between flaviviruses and ZIKV strains with respect to shell disorder and virulence has not been conducted as of yet. Intriguingly, while ZIKV is not known for its virulence [5] , there are distinct disparities in the levels of potential to cause fetal morbidity between various ZIKV strains of different lineages [38, 39] . However, no attempt has been made to correlate fetal morbidity and shell disorder until now. The research conducted in this paper demonstrates not only that ZIKV fits well within the previously observed correlations between flavivirus virulence and shell disorder, but that the uniqueness of the ZIKV shell disorder pattern is consistent with the varying levels of fetal morbidity caused by strains of different lineages.",

The corresponding protein sequences in FASTA format were fed into the PONDR VLXT neural network (http://www.pondr.com). The results were given as scores from 0 to 1. Residues with scores of 0.5 and over represent disordered residues [41, 42] . An important ratio used in this and previous studies is the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered in a protein chain divided by the total number of residues in the chain. The PID can range from 0% (perfectly ordered) to 100% (totally disordered).",

PONDR represents a suite of computational tools for sequence-only predictions of the intrinsic disorder predisposition of query in proteins. PONDR VLXT was the earliest predictor created at the end of the last century [41, 42] . It involves the use of neural networks that are trained to recognize protein sequences that are ordered and those that are not [53] . Statistical methods, including regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to analyze the PONDR VLXT results along with data on virulence and morbidity. The statistical package R version 3.6.0. [54] was used to obtain the results. Before obtaining the necessary results, the respective codes had to be written in R.",

ZIKV strains are generally categorized as of African or Asian lineage, and the epidemic that occurred in 2015-2016 involved Asian strains that had crossed the Pacific Ocean to reach the Americas. At least two laboratories have found that ZIKV strains of African lineage are more dangerous to fetuses than those of Asian lineage [38, 55] . The classical isolate for the strains of African lineage is MR-766, which was discovered in Uganda in 1947 [1, 56] . A PID-based wide selection of ZIKV strains and isolates allowed us to see that the strains can be divided into four groups that are consistent with their lineages but that are independent of the dates of the isolates ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ). Interestingly, our results show that there are at least two MR-766 isolates from Uganda-1947 with distinct shell disorder features (Table 1) . Furthermore, DENV-2 has also been shown to cause microcephaly in fetuses and newborns, but to a lesser extent when compared to ZIKV [38, 39, 55] . This has been observed in several laboratories using in vivo and in vitro methods. Chicken liver cells, human nerve cells, and mouse models were used, and the levels of destruction by ZIKV and DENV-2 were observed according to the amount of cells destroyed [38, 39, 55] . The PIDs of DENV-2 and ZIKV are compared in Figure 1 and Table 1 .",

According to our research on other viruses, the capsid association with virulence involves a mechanism of protein promiscuity, whereby intrinsic disorder allows the capsid protein (the C protein, in the case of flaviviruses) to bind to a greater number of proteins, thereby allowing the virus to multiply more rapidly before the host immune system can take action [2, 14, 51] . The matrix protein (the M protein in flaviviruses), on the other hand, is likely to play a somewhat different role. A more disordered matrix allows the virus to penetrate organs, namely vital organs, as in the case of HIV-1, but still be able to evade the host immune systems via matrix and surface glycoprotein motions [14, 46, 52] .",

As in previous studies, the PID of the C protein, as the sole independent variable, provided a weaker correlation with flavivirus CFR that was of statistical significance (r 2 = 0.3, F = 6, p < 0.05). Similarly, the PID of the M protein, as the sole independent variable, also did not provide a very strong correlation with flavivirus CFR, even if this correlation was statistically significant (r 2 = 0.4, F = 9, p < 0.05). The use of PIDs of both M and C proteins as independent variables, on the other hand, gave a strong correlation with flavivirus CFR that was definitely stronger than the PIDs of C or M proteins alone (r 2 = 0.38, F = 14, p < 0.01, Figure 1B ). Obviously, both M and C proteins complement each other in their combined contributions to virulence, which can be seen in both Figure 1B and Table 2 . There was also a statistically significant interaction between the two factors (p < 0.01). Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that ZIKV is a peculiar virus, since it has a relatively disordered M protein but also a relatively ordered C protein. This accounts for the ZIKV characteristics of low mortality rates and yet high fetal morbidity rates. However, the use of PID values is inadequate in providing a closer look at the differences in the disordered regions among the various viruses. Figures 2 and 3 provide us with the opportunity for a detailed look at the disorder differences by region of the proteins among several flaviviruses. Figure 2A shows that disordered regions of the M proteins of ZIKV and YFV are relatively large and overlap. With the disordered regions being found mostly around the N-termini of the M proteins of the three flaviviruses shown, a much shorter disordered region is found in the DENV-2 M protein.",

As mentioned, studies have shown that disorder in the inner shells of viruses in general tend to be associated with greater virulence because of the ability of proteins to bind more promiscuously, thus providing the viruses with greater ability to replicate more rapidly. Similarly, Figure 1B and Table 2 suggest that the reason that the ZIKV's CFR is extremely low has to do with the relatively low mean PID of its C protein (35 \u00b1 6%, CFR~0). While these results tell us about the differences with regard to the mean C PIDs among the various flaviviruses, they do pinpoint the disorder differences among the various flaviviruses along the entire stretch of the various flavivirus C proteins, especially with respect to ZIKV. Figure 2B attempts to address this problem by showing that the disorder differences between C proteins from ZIKV and other flaviviruses lie in two areas near the N-and C-termini, respectively.",

Figure 4A shows that the M protein is relatively more disordered (in red) than in DENV-1 ( Figure 4B ). As with the PONDR VLXT plots in Figure 2 , the disordered regions of both ZIKV and DENV-1 are restricted to segments near the N-termini. While we have seen that the M proteins of ZIKV and YFV are relatively disordered, the same cannot be said about Pr. The Pr proteins for YFV and ZIKV are quite ordered, as seen in Figure 4C -E. The Pr disorder levels are relatively low for most flaviviruses [2, 25] , as seen in the cases of ZIKV, DENV, and WNV. With Pr being mostly ordered for most flaviviruses and M being the same for most flaviviruses (with the exception of YFV and ZIKV), one can conclude that both Pr and M contribute to the order of the PrM proteins for most flaviviruses, and this is especially important with respect to protecting the immature virion.",

A hint to the answer to this question lies in the PID of their Pr proteins. As we can see in Figure 4C -E, the Pr proteins of both ZIKV and YFV are quite ordered, well within the range of most flaviviruses. As a result, fairly ordered PrM proteins are seen in both ZIKV and YFV. The study therefore shows that the immature virions of ZIKV and YFV are more protected against environmental insults than are their corresponding mature virions, which could suggest a slightly different life cycle for YFV and ZIKV. While mature viruses are of course infectious, experimental evidence has suggested that fully immature flaviviruses are generally not infectious, even if they may become infectious upon interactions with antibodies [61] . Partially mature viruses are likely more infectious than fully immature ones [62] . ZIKV and YFV could therefore rely more on lesser mature viruses for their spread, given our evidence showing that their virions become more delicate upon maturation.",

HIV-1 patients are known to have much greater viral loads in their bloodstream than patients with HIV-2. Without the help of retroviral drugs, over 90% of HIV-1 patients would die within 10 years of the infection, whereas those infected with HIV-2 take a much longer time to succumb to the disease, if at all [46, 63] . The roles of the matrix protein in virulence have to do with viral ability to evade the host immune system and also the ability to bind promiscuously to more host proteins [18, 19, 21, 22] . An important characteristic of HIV is its ability to penetrate vital organs, including the brain, with ease [14] . Apparently, the promiscuous binding potential arising from the disordered matrix shell allows HIV to have easier access to specialized cells.

It is likely that the highly disordered C protein allows for more rapid replication via its promiscuity in protein binding. As a result of the rapid replication, greater viral loads are more attainable, leading to greater virulence. A higher disorder in the M protein, however, allows the virus to more easily penetrate different organs, including vital organs such as the liver [2, 15] .

The \"Trojan horse\" theory tells us that the higher C disorder allows for more efficient proliferation of the virus in the larger variety of organs that it is able to penetrate [2, 49] .",

Inspection of the PONDR VLXT plot shows that the disordered regions lie in both the N-and C-termini even if the ZIKV C mutations arise entirely within the N-terminus (Figure 3 ). This provides clues to the evolution of ZIKV with respect to its ability to cause fetal morbidity in its hosts. It is likely that ZIKV had to evolve with the primate species that it most commonly infects. For certain primate hosts, it finds greater fitness when a greater viral load is necessary for it to infect a larger number of hosts because of the peculiarities found in the hosts' immune system: having a more disordered C protein does the trick. It is therefore likely that the different PIDs of C proteins from the various ZIKV strains and lineages are the result of the types of primates that the peculiar ZIKV strain primarily infects and its ability to fine-tune its C disorder to meet the optimal viral load necessary for more efficient transmission of the virus in a given host, as seen in the case of other viruses and other flaviviruses [2, 14, 25, 39, 49, 50] .",

Flavivirus protein C, along with other viral proteins, assists in the assembly and packaging of viral particles during replication, in addition to assisting the protein M to move to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Additionally, the C protein is trafficked to the nucleus through binding with importin [64] . Upon doing so, it interacts with histones to force the cell to stay longer in the G1 stage of the cell cycle so as to buy more time for viral replication [65] . In the cytoplasm, protein C binds to the Sec3 protein in order to inhibit Sec3 proteasomal antiviral activity [66] .",

The other reason is that PrM prevents E from being so embedded in the host membrane that it cannot be removed in the later stages of the virion replication process. While the Pr segment is ordered to protect E from the proteases, the greater flexibility of M in many flaviviruses is likely needed to ensure greater efficiency in its binding to the ER.",

Figure 3 reiterates the minimum requirements necessary in the development of a ZIKV vaccine: the PID of the C protein has to be as low as possible. Figure 2B , on the other hand, suggests ways that a ZIKV can be used for a ZIKV vaccine developed by comparing the PONDR VLXT plots of the ZIKV C protein to those of other flaviviruses. More specifically, it shows a region near the C-terminus that is ordered in WNV but disordered in ZIKV. This region could be a good target for the development of an attenuated ZIKV, as it indicates a region that is not necessarily disordered but is still tolerated by a cousin, WNV.",

Since the M protein of DENV has a much shorter disordered region ( Figures 2B and 4A ,B), Figure 2A identifies an area that is ordered in DENV and would be a good target of mutations during the development of an attenuated ZIKV.

The other is the somewhat large variation in the disorder of ZIKV depending on the strain and lineage of the virus. These oddities are consistent with what we now know as characteristics of ZIKV. Just as other viruses (such as WNV and HIV-1) that have high outer shell (matrix/membrane) PIDs are able to penetrate vital organs, ZIKV can also penetrate the placenta and brain [12] . Furthermore, scientists have discovered that strains of the African lineage possess a greater potential to cause fetal morbidity. This fact correlates with the variations in the disorder levels of the ZIKV C protein. Disorder in the inner shell has already been associated with virulence and higher viral loads in other flaviviruses and other unrelated viruses, such as in the Ebola and Nipah viruses.",

The results presented here could lead to the development of a new vaccine through the creation of attenuated strains resulting from more ordered C and M proteins. The regions for potential vaccine targets are disordered regions of the ZIKV M and C proteins that are ordered in other flavivirus species. Exploration of a ZIKV vaccine could include mutations in these areas. Other applications could include building a more comprehensive model that could anticipate the behaviors of new or little-known viruses. Lastly, the ability of ZIKV and YFV to penetrate vital organs as a result of shell disorder adds to a growing body of knowledge that encompasses a variety of viruses, such as HIV, that use such strategies to enter or to hide in hard-to-reach organs. An important potential application of this is in the field of cancer oncolysis, which involves the use of viruses to \"attack\" tumors, since both share the same pathways [68, 69] . Viruses could be engineered to evade host immune systems that impede the effectiveness of therapeutic viruses. Moreover, since cancers in hard-to-reach organs such as the brain are often problematic for virotherapies and chemotherapies [14, 70] , a better understanding of the roles of shell disorder in the viral penetration of such organs will lead to improved therapies.
