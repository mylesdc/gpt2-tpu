However, closely related coronaviruses, such as WIV1, currently circulate in bat reservoirs and are capable of utilizing human receptors to enter cells 2 and there are no vaccines or virus-specific treatments available for human use. The more recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 1 and the likelihood of future zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses to humans from animal reservoirs makes robust reagent development for the display of neutralizing epitopes of great importance to human health.

The S1 subunit is responsible for host-receptor binding while the S2 subunit contains the membrane-fusion machinery. During viral entry, the S1 subunit binds host receptors in an interaction thought to expose a secondary cleavage site within S2 (S2\u2032) adjacent to the fusion peptide for cleavage by host proteases 4-7 . This S2\u2032 proteolysis has been hypothesized to facilitate insertion of the fusion peptide into host membranes after the first heptad repeat region (HR1) of the S2 subunit rearranges into an extended \u03b1-helix 8-10 .

Initial examination of HCoV-HKU1 S showed that the receptor-binding site on the S1 RBD was occluded when the RBD was in a 'down' conformation and it was hypothesized that conformational changes were required to access this site 16 . Subsequent studies of the highly pathogenic human coronavirus S proteins of SARS-CoV 15, 22 and MERS-CoV 17, 22 showed that these viral S1 RBD do indeed sample an 'up' conformation where the receptor-binding site is accessible. These structural studies also located the positions of the S1/ S2 and S2\u2032 cleavage sites on the prefusion spike. The S1/S2 site lies within a surface exposed loop in the second subdomain of S1 16 .

The instability of the prefusion state presents a significant challenge for the production of protein antigens for antigenic presentation of the prefusion antibody epitopes that are most likely to lead to neutralizing responses. Recently, we presented the design of two proline mutations (2P) for the prefusion stabilization of coronavirus S proteins 17 . The stabilized MERS-CoV S 2P ectodomain was shown to maintain the prefusion spike conformation, have similar antibody recognition as wild-type S and possess higher immunogenicity. Here, we have used single-particle cryo-EM to determine structures of prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain in uncleaved, S1/S2 cleaved and ACE2-bound states. Three-dimensional classification of the S1 RBD positions and corresponding atomic protein models revealed that neither ACE2-binding nor trypsin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary induced substantial conformational changes in the prefusion stabilized S protein.",

To examine any potential conformational differences in SARS-CoV S 2P compared to unstabilized wild-type S ectodomains 15, 22 , we determined structures of the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain. This included a 3.2 \u00c5 resolution C3-symmetric reconstruction and several asymmetric reconstructions (3.9-4.5 \u00c5, see below) ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S4 and Figs S1, S2). The S1 NTD and some of the S1 RBD, while clearly present, appear poorly resolved in the cryo-EM maps, precluding a de novo build of these regions. For this reason, available SARS-CoV S crystal structures 22,23 of corresponding domains were placed into these densities. Overall, the SARS-CoV S 2P structure resembles that of other coronaviruses, particularly those of the betacoronavirus genus 16, 17, 19, 22 and the previously published SARS-CoV wild-type prefusion ectodomains 15, 22 . The S1 domains surround the helical S2 subunits and interdigitate at the 22 (5X58.pdb, dark green) and the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain (6CRV.pdb light green) adopt identical conformations near the 2P mutation site. Coordinate models derived from C3 symmetry cryo-EM reconstructions are shown. (c) There is highly featured density in the region containing the 2P mutation site.

S1 regions are shown in blue and S2 regions are shown in green. membrane-distal apex of the trimeric spike. The structure of the S2 subunit appears to be highly conserved across coronavirus genera 18, 20, 21 .

Gui et al. 15 , however, observed a gradient of conformations in wild-type SARS-CoV S, which has not been observed in other structural studies of coronavirus spikes nor the work presented here. Some possibilities for these different observations may be the differences in spike expression system yielding alternate glycosylation patterns or alternate protein constructs, but the true source remains unclear. The 'down' conformation caps the S2 helices and makes extensive contacts with the S1 NTD. The 'up' conformation of the S1 RBD exposes the S1 RBD receptor-binding site. It has been previously reported that for wild-type SARS-CoV S, 56% of the particles contained three 'down' RBD conformations while 44% contained a single 'up' S1 RBD conformation 22 . To examine the conformation of the S1 RBD among our SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomains, we used a local masking, image sutraction and 3-D sorting strategy 17 to more accurately classify the conformations as being either 'down' or 'up' at each of the three S1 RBD positions within the trimer. This analysis revealed that the majority of the S 2P proteins were in the single-'up' conformation (58%) with lesser amounts of double-and triple-'up' conformations (39% and 3% respectively) and with no all-'down' conformation observed. The increased propensity to adopt the 'up' S1 RBD conformation may indicate a difference in the coronavirus S containing the 2P mutations, however other differences in sample preparation cannot be fully ruled out.",

This strongly suggests that binding of a single ACE2 receptor does not induce adjacent S1 RBDs to transition from a 'down' to 'up' conformation within the context of the stabilized S. Hence, ACE2 is more likely to bind to an already 'up' S1 RBD rather than inducing the conformational changes that are required for the S1 RBD to become accessible to ACE2. Though the proportion of 'up' S1 RBD in the ACE2 dataset (58%) is similar to the proportion of 'up' S1 RBD in the SARS S 2P ectodomain dataset (48%), there is a large difference in the distributions of one 'up' and two 'up' conformational states between these datasets.

In contrast, isolated recombinant S1 RBD easily binds ACE2 and is capable saturating ACE2 on target cells to block S-mediated entry 14 . Our observed sub-stoichiometric ACE2 binding to trimeric spikes is consistent with the difficulty in using soluble ACE2 receptor to neutralize SARS-CoV S pseudotyped onto VSV 25 .

This difference is likely due to poor density in the hinge regions between the S1 RBD and subdomain 1 (SD-1) in these previous reconstructions 15, 22 rather than the presentation of a unique receptor-bound conformation or the influence of the stabilizing mutations. Indeed, the bound ACE2 receptor and S1 RBD for all reconstructions here show poorer density quality than the less mobile regions of the SARS-CoV S (Fig. 4) . To improve the density for ACE2-bound S1 RBD, we used focused refinement with image subtraction on this region to overcome the flexibility of these domains relative to the rest of SARS-CoV S 2P. This yielded a 7.9 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction with improved local density quality (Fig. 4b,c) . We successfully placed the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S1 RBD bound to ACE2 (2AJF.pdb 23 ) into this density as a rigid body indicating that the previously determined crystal structure accurately recapitulates the conformation between the ACE2-bound S1 RBD in the prefusion stabilized trimeric spike. Given that the S1 RBD in its 'up' conformation is well separated in space and sequence from the 2P stabilizing mutations, we do not anticipate that the introduction of these prefusion stabilizing mutations influences the molecular interactions between the S1 RBD and ACE2 beyond perhaps increasing the prevalence of the S1 RBD 'up' conformations as noted above. Indeed, both the wild-type and 2P-stabilized SARS-CoV S ectodomains demonstrate similar affinities for ACE2 by SPR (185 and 150 nM respectively, Supplementary Fig. S7) .",

The absence of conformational changes includes regions near the S2\u2032 cleavage site, fusion peptide and S2 heptad repeat 1 (HR1). However, fine examination of the ACE2-bound S structure revealed a modest conformational change in the S2 central helix where the S2 had been uncapped by a receptor-bound RBD. In both the wild-type 15, 22 and 2P unbound structures, the central helix presents as an \u03b1-helix in each protomer of the trimer. However, in the ACE2-bound structure, the upper portion of the S2 helix uncapped by the ACE2-bound S1 RBD has transitioned to a 3 10 -helix (Fig. 4d,e) . The \u03b1to 3 10 -helix transition is unique to the S2 protomer uncapped by the ACE2-bound S1 RBD and is not observed in the other two copies of the trimeric spike. This subtle transition may indicate that conformational changes towards fusion are initiated in the central helix. N-terminal to the central helix are the 2P mutations that stabilize the spike in its prefusion conformation.

Nearing the end of the time course additional lower molecular weight bands are observed which we interpret to be degradation of the S1 subunit. Regardless of whether wild-type or prefusion-stabilized S was used or whether ACE2 was bound to the S ectodomains, there is no prominent band that corresponds to a S2\u2032 cleavage product (approximately 52 kDa).",

The short loop containing the S1/S2 cleavage site is disordered in the uncleaved S 2P reconstruction and remains disordered in the S 2P trypsin cleaved reconstruction. Moreover, examination of the structure models indicates no significant differences between the trypsin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV S 2P (Fig. 5b) . Fine sorting of S1 RBD positions of the trypsin-cleaved S reveals a very similar distribution of 'up' S1 RBD conformations available for receptor binding as in the uncleaved samples, although we additionally observe a small proportion of S1 RBD in the all-'down' conformation (Fig. 5c) . These results indicate that trypsin-cleavage at S1/S2 does not impart large conformational changes on the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P and justifies the removal of S1/S2 cleavage sites for the production of more homogeneous material as vaccine immunogens.",

Our structures of the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain bound to a soluble form of human ACE2 receptor show that any conformational changes induced in S by receptor binding are more likely to be due to the disruption of protein-protein interactions rather than the formation of additional contacts between the S1 RBD and other regions of S (Supplementary Fig. S8 ). The only conformational change that we observe in the ACE2-SARS-CoV S 2P structures is the transition to a short 3 10 -helix at the top of the S2 central \u03b1-helix when uncapped by receptor-bound S1 RBD suggesting that more extensive conformational changes may be initiated here. 3 10 -helices have been hypothesized to act as intermediates in coil-to-\u03b1-helix transitions 32 . Transitions between 3 10 -helices and \u03b1-helices has also been hypothesized for the voltage sensing domains of potassium channels where it has been proposed that the transition plays a role in changing from a resting or activated state to a relaxed state 33 . Though more extensive changes are likely to drive conformational rearrangements accompanying membrane fusion, the 2P prefusion stabilizing mutations adjacent to the short 3 10 -helix may block these changes from occurring. However, both wild-type and 2P SARS-CoV S ectodomains bound to ACE2 were cleaved equally by trypsin, indicating that at least at the level of trypsin protease susceptibility, these two receptor-bound complexes appear equivalent. Strategies similar to those we have used have been employed to stabilize HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers in prefusion conformation 34, 35 . HIV Env, which, like SARS CoV S also engages a protein receptor, CD4, undergoes a large conformational change on the viral surface upon binding 36 . Similarly, the soluble, stabilized versions of Env undergo large conformational changes upon CD4 binding [37] [38] [39] . Conversely, the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) undergoes only modest conformational changes upon binding its receptor, NPC-1 40, 41 . Thus, these class I fusion machines likely have fundamental differences in the fusion process that requires further study.",
