The authors contend that all-hazards, or capabilities-based planning, in which a set of core capabilities applicable to numerous types of events is developed, is a more efficient way to achieve general health care system emergency preparedness than scenario-based planning. Essentially, the core of what is necessary to plan for and respond to one kind of disaster (e.g. a biologic event) is also necessary for planning and responding to other types of disasters, allowing for improvements in planning and maximizing efficiencies. While Adini, et al. have advanced the science of health care emergency preparedness through their consideration of 490 measures to assess preparedness, a shorter set of validated preparedness measures would support the dual goals of accountability and improved outcomes and could provide the basis for determining which actions in the name of preparedness really matter.",

The empirical evidence for much of health emergency preparedness is scant. As a result, it is challenging to define what it means to be \"fully prepared.\" Collectively, the world has dealt with numerous disasters, but only a handful of nations have confronted many. This has made it challenging to convincingly link the structures and processes for health preparedness to outcomes, particularly mitigation of morbidity and mortality.",

They contend that allhazards, or capabilities-based planning is a more efficient way to achieve general health care system preparedness than scenario-based planning. The authors describe a systematic investigation of the components of their preparedness system that impact hospital preparedness. The paper represents an important advance on several fronts. First, it describes a system of measurement which is consistently applied to assess and improve the preparedness of hospitals. Second, it uses thoughtful analytic methods to answer the question of whether an all-hazards approach is an appropriate methodology for preparedness. Supporting this, the authors found moderate to strong correlations between preparedness measures for various kinds of disasters-including mass casualty, toxicologic, and biological events. In other words, the core of what is necessary to plan for and respond to one kind of disaster (e.g. biologic event) assists with for planning and responding to other types of disasters. This finding allows for improvements and greater efficiencies in planning and time-consuming and expensive drills and exercises; an important consideration given the current fiscal climate in countries worldwide. Third, the authors found that SOPs, training and drills made more of a contribution to overall preparedness than equipment and preparedness knowledge of personnel-an important observation that facilitates effective resource allocation.",

While Adini, et al., initially considered 490 measures to assess preparedness, we recognize that countries and systems may not be capable of consistently deploying and analyzing such a large volume of measures. Interestingly, the findings by Adini, et al., support a shift to an all-hazards approach which, enables a reduction in the number of measures. Future work should examine the correlations between measures, and could make use of techniques such as factor analysis to identify a short set of measures, or even scales, that could serve as proxys for a longer, more complex measurement set.",
