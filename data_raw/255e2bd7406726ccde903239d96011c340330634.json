The aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and to investigate co-infections with other infectious organisms. Findings: Samples of 168 aborted foetuses or mummified foetuses from five farrow-to-finish swine farms known to be infected with PCV2 and located in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo were tested for PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were additionally tested for porcine parvovirus (PPV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. by PCR. PCV2 was detected in 18 of the samples (10.7%). PPV, Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp were found in 2, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. Eleven PCV2 strains were sequenced and determined to be either genotype 2a (n = 1) or 2b (n = 10).",

Tissue pools were analysed for PCV2 by PCR using the primer pair Fa/Ra, which amplifies a 476 bp fragment [4] . PCV2 positive samples were additionally tested for Brucella spp, Leptospira spp. and. porcine parvovirus (PPV) by PCR. Brucella spp. DNA was detected using the genus specific primer pair ITS66/ITS279 [7] . The PCR assay for the detection of Leptospira spp. was conducted using the primer pair Lep1/Lep2, which amplifies a 331 bp fragment from the 16S rRNA gene of Leptospira spp [8] . Finally, PPV DNA amplification was achieved using a pair of primers directed to the VP2 sense/antisense template that amplifies a 197 bp fragment [9] . To avoid false-negative PCR results due to failures during DNA isolation or the presence of PCR inhibitors, the extracted DNA was tested in parallel for the amplification of \u03b2-actin as a PCR control [10] . Positive controls (PCV2, PPV, Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. templates) and negative controls (sterilised MilliQ water) were used in each reaction. McNemar's test for the comparison of paired proportions was used to determine the significance of differences (P < 0.05) between PCV2 positive samples and presence of the other organisms.",

Most field reports are based on accidental findings by diagnostic laboratories. Although the samples studied here were collected in PCV2 positive swine herds that had other clinical signs of PCVAD than reproductive failure, PCV2 was detected as a mono-infection in only 3.57% of the samples. The prevalence of dual or triple infections including PCV2 was higher (7.2%). Previous studies performed in Brazil have failed to detect PCV2 in samples from incidents of reproductive failures or only detected PCV2 at similar low levels (5.74%) [14] [15] [16] . The low rate of PCV2 detection in the cases studied here is similar to rates found in other studies [17] . However, the importance of the virus in some incidents of reproductive failure has been demonstrated by Lyoo et al. [18] , who detected mono-infection with PCV2 in 4/16 aborted foetuses in Korea. The role for PCV2 in reproductive failure was also reported from the Czech Republic, where the frequency of PCV2 isolation in association with reproductive failure increased from 2005 to 2007 [19] . The discrepancies between studies may be associated with the PCV2 load in the herds and the time of infection of gilts as demonstrated by Hansen et al [14] . Occurrence of PCV2 associated reproductive disorders is more common in gilts or in new herds that have recently been exposed to the virus [5] .",

A number of studies have reported co-infections with PCV2 and PPV, and PPV has been established as an important virus involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure [17, 18] . Coinfections between PCV2 and Brucella spp. has not been reported previously. Despite a national control program for brucellosis in Brazil, the organism was detected in 10/18 PCV2 positive samples. Because of the importance of Brucella spp. as a zoonotic agent, farmers with herds that were positive for brucellosis were notified of their status to improve brucellosis control.",

AMMGC and KLF set up the PCV2 PCR and sequencing. LRJ critically revised the manuscript and gave the final approval for publication. TFC and TMK set up the PPV PCR and sequencing and helped with the writing of that part. VRS set up the Brucella spp PCR and sequencing and helped with the writing of that part. JPAJr drew the PPV PCR and sequencing and helped with the results interpretation of that part. PEB helped with the sequencing PCV2 analyses and helped with the results interpretation of that part.
