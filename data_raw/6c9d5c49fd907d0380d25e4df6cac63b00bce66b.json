There are currently no licensed vaccines for CHIKV and current anti-inflammatory drug treatment is often inadequate. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two human monoclonal antibodies, C9 and E8, from CHIKV infected and recovered individuals. C9 was determined to be a potent virus neutralizing antibody and a biosensor antibody binding study demonstrated it recognized residues on intact CHIKV VLPs. Shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning of 98 percent of the residues in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV envelope showed that the epitope bound by C9 included amino-acid 162 in the acid-sensitive region (ASR) of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. The ASR is critical for the rearrangement of CHIKV E2 during fusion and viral entry into host cells, and we predict that C9 prevents these events from occurring. When used prophylactically in a CHIKV mouse model, C9 completely protected against CHIKV viremia and arthritis. We also observed that when administered therapeutically at 8 or 18 hours post-CHIKV challenge, C9 gave 100% protection in a pathogenic mouse model. Given that targeting this novel neutralizing epitope in E2 can potently protect both in vitro and in vivo, it is likely to be an important region both for future antibody and vaccine-based interventions against CHIKV.",

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus first isolated in Tanzania in 1952 [1] that has caused sporadic outbreaks of predominantly rheumatic disease every 2-50 years, primarily in Africa and Asia. The largest epidemic of CHIKV disease ever recorded took place during 2004-2011, and involved an estimated 1.4 to 6.5 million cases and the first autochthonous CHIKV infections in Europe (Italy in 2007 and France in 2010) [2, 3] . Imported cases were also reported in nearly 40 countries, including European countries, Japan, and the USA. The epidemic was associated with the emergence of a new clade of viruses, which were efficiently transmitted by Aedes albopictus, a mosquito vector that has seen a dramatic global expansion in its geographic distribution [4] [5] [6] . CHIKV disease is characterized by acute and chronic polyarthritis/polyarthralgia, which is usually symmetric and often incapacitating and occasionally protracted [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Other symptoms, such as fever, rash, myalgia, and/or fatigue, are often also present during the acute phase. The recent epidemic was also associated with atypical and severe clinical forms of CHIKV disease and some fatalities, which appeared to be restricted to the very young and elderly patients with comorbidities [8, 9] . CHIKV virions contain three major structural proteins: glycosylated El and E2 envelope (env) proteins embedded in the viral membrane, and a non-glycosylated nucleocapsid protein.",

The folding, transport to the surface and function of these glycoproteins relies on their correct interactions with each other. E1 consists of three b-sheet domains, termed I, II and III, while E2 contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (A, B and C, with A being at the N-terminus). In the complex, domain B lies at the membrane distal end and contacts E3, domain C is closest to the viral membrane and domain A is in the center. E1 interacts laterally with E2 all along domain II, along with additional points of contact from other regions of E1. E1 contains an internal fusion loop at the tip of domain II, which in the mature structure exists as a b-hairpin lodged in a groove between domains A and B of E2 [15] . E3 also plays a role in protecting the fusion loop from premature exposure.",

Currently there are no FDA-approved vaccines or specific antiviral treatments for CHIKV. We thus identified and characterized human monoclonal antibodies directed against CHIKV that could be utilized in prophylactic and immediate post-exposure settings. Such patient derived monoclonal antibodies could also provide useful information on critical antigens and epitopes for development of future vaccines and other biologics. We describe here the identification of two monoclonal antibodies (C9 and E8) isolated from recovered patients. C9 potently inhibited CHIKV infection in cells and prevented viremia and arthritis in a mouse model of CHIKV disease. The epitope for this antibody includes an amino-acid residue in a key acidsensitive region of the E2 glycoprotein of CHIKV. Rearrangement of this region following exposure to low pH is critical for uncovering portions of the companion E1 glycoprotein, required for successful entry of CHIKV into cells. We hypothesize that binding of antibodies to this region stabilizes the native complex and thus prevents such rearrangements.",

In total, 910 CHIKV Env mutants were generated (98.5% coverage), sequence confirmed, and arrayed into 384-well plates.

The E2-A162 residue is in the acid-sensitive region (ASR), sandwiched in a critical pocket between CHIKV E1, E2 and E3, as determined by the CHIKV envelope crystal structure [15, 40] . Interestingly, the ASR, along with the E2 domain B, was also recently described for alphaviruses as being unstructured following acid pH triggering [40] . In our study we found that residue E2-A162, when mutated to serine, reacted at 12% of WT reactivity against C9 but reacted at greater than 70% of WT reactivity against other anti-CHIKV antibodies, strongly suggesting that the E2-A162S mutant is properly folded and involved in the C9/envelope binding interaction ( Figure 4A ).

We performed in vivo antibody titration experiments and dosed neonates immediately before CHIKV challenge via intraperitoneal injection with C9 mAb at 100, 20, 10, 4, 1 and 0.1 mg/mouse (or approximately equaling 25, 5, 2.5, 1.0, 0.25 and 0.025 mg/kg respectively).

Mice that were given 0.025 mg/kg of C9 mAb succumbed to CHIKV-driven lethality similarly to control groups. Our results demonstrate that with a potent neutralizing antibody such as C9 (IC 90 of 0.3 mg/ml) we can protect 100% of mice with 1 mg/kg of C9 mAb and about half of all neonatal mice with only 0.25 mg/kg of C9.",

We previously developed a CHIKV pseudovirus assay [28] that we found amenable in our current study for high-throughput screening and selection of B-cell clones expressing CHIKV neutralizing antibodies. C9 neutralizes both CHIKV pseudoviruses and replication-competent viruses with high potency. The E8 monoclonal antibody shows less dramatic neutralization of pseudovirus and does not neutralize live virus at the highest concentration tested (20 mg/ml). This suggests that although CHIKV antibody selection can be carried out using the high-throughput pseudovirus assays for greater convenience, a live virus-PRNT assay is the more reliable confirmatory assay for CHIKV neutralization.",

E8 recognized 6 spatially proximal residues (Y69, F84, V113, G114, T116A and D117) in E2 domain A, however the nonneutralizing nature of the E8 antibody suggests that the residues are not easily accessible on the native CHIKV envelope on live virus, and indeed the epitope appears to be partially occluded when visualized on the native trimer crystal structure. The sitedirected mutagenesis mapping studies, confirmed by neutralization escape mutant studies, revealed that E2-A162 is a critical All mice were infected with CHIKV at hour 0. Data on CHIKV infected mice without antibody treatment and mice treated with control or C9 antibody at hour 0 are also shown in Figure 6 . residue required for C9 mAb recognition. Interestingly, based on the crystal structure of the CHIKV envelope, the E2-A162 residue is located in the ASR of E2 that encompasses amino acids 159-171 and 231-258 [15] . The ASR in E2, along with domain B, is a highly conserved functional region among alphaviruses and is involved in the conformational rearrangements triggered by acid pH that lead to the exposure of the fusion loop in E1 and finally results in membrane fusion [15, 40] . It is possible that neutralizing antibodies such as C9 that bind to the ASR region could fully or partially prevent the disordering and dissociation of E2 from E1 following pH triggering, thereby reducing fusion efficiency and CHIKV entry. Residues within the ASR have previously been reported to be critical for efficient particle formation and stability [44] , highlighting the delicate conformational balance that this region brings to E2. The critical E2-A162 residue is highly conserved among different CHIKV strains and is represented in the 1950's West African isolates 37997 and S27, as well as in the more recently circulating LR2006 OPY-1 strain. However, a previous study described a strain (Ag41855) isolated from Uganda during a 1982 outbreak that has a valine at the E2-162 position [41] . Mutating E2-A162 to valine did not result in a loss of C9 potency, suggesting C9 should be active against most currently circulating strains of CHIKV and other strains that arise in the future with that particular amino-acid. The fact that E2 proteins bearing the aliphatic, hydrophobic amino-acids alanine or valine did not prevent C9 neutralization, while E2 with a polar serine residue at position 162 escaped neutralization, suggests that C9 forms a critical hydrophobic interaction with that sidechain position.",

While, the isolation and epitope characterization of C9 antibody and demonstration of its potent neutralization in vitro and in vivo are invaluable to future studies aimed at identification of neutralization epitopes in order to produce effective antigens for vaccines, we hypothesize that the epitope recognized by the C9 antibody is also an important region to target for antibody-based intervention in future anti-CHIKV strategies. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of combinations of mAbs is advantageous for in vivo protection by limiting development of resistance [26] and different mechanisms of viral spread [24] .
