Indeed, an increasing number of new cases have been reported in this region (Madagascar, Mauritius, R\u00e9union (France), and Seychelles, except Comoros and Mayotte (France)), and are described in this review. Our review clearly points out that further studies are needed in order to investigate the real incidence and burden of melioidosis in the western Indian Ocean and especially Madagascar, since it is likely to be higher than currently reported. Thus, research and surveillance priorities were recommended (i) to improve awareness of melioidosis in the population and among clinicians; (ii) to improve diagnostics, in order to provide rapid and effective treatment; (iii) to implement a surveillance and reporting system in the western Indian Ocean; and (iv) to investigate the presence of B. pseudomallei in environmental samples, since we have demonstrated its presence in soil samples originating from the yard of a Madagascan case.",

The first human case of melioidosis in the region was detected in May 2004 in a 60-year-old Frenchman living in Mahajanga, a city on the northwestern coast of Madagascar, along the Mozambique Channel, who had been transferred to a hospital in R\u00e9union Island. He was admitted to an intensive care unit for management of respiratory distress and septic shock. About 20 or 30 years before the onset of the disease, he had lived for an unknown period of time in Vietnam, where melioidosis is endemic. He was a heavy drinker and smoker with cachexia. Four blood cultures and one bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, taken the first day after admission, were positive for B. pseudomallei [9] . The initial treatment was a combination of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin (the initial identification was 'Pseudomonas sp.'), followed by ceftazidime when B. pseudomallei was recognized. Interestingly, two secondary cases (cases #2 and #3), acquired 150 and 180 days after the initial case and transmitted by a fiberoptic bronchoscope, were detected. A manufacturing defect rendered the decontamination processes of the bronchoscope insufficiently effective, and culture with subsequent DNA restriction analysis confirmed the secondary transmissions. These nosocomial transmissions concerned an 81-year-old man suffering from a chronic pulmonary disease, and a woman undergoing glucocorticoid therapy for lupus. Both secondary cases were also treated with ceftazidime (120 mg/kg/day) until recovery, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 20 weeks.",

The patient, a retired manager, had spent most of his life in France, and he had traveled for short periods in Tunisia, Turkey, and Mauritius (six years previously). His first symptoms (high fever with cough) appeared during a two-week holiday trip to Mahajanga in March 2005. He was initially admitted to a hospital in Antananarivo, where he was treated for ten days with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin after a chest X-ray showed a patchy infiltrate of the right upper and middle lobes. His sputum acid-fast stain was negative. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged, but five days later he became feverish again, and was referred to a hospital in R\u00e9union Island for further management. Although four blood cultures were negative, B. pseudomallei was isolated from his bronchoalveolar lavage. He responded to treatment, which firstly comprised imipenem for two weeks, followed by oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. He was discharged at day 20 on eradication treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for a further five months.",

They were both suffering from diabetes mellitus, and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were detected by abdominal ultrasound examination during their hospitalization. The diagnosis of B. pseudomallei was possible thanks to a specific research study on melioidosis that was being conducted in this hospital during the period 2012-2013, which supported the purchase of consumables, such as blood culture bottles and culture media (chocolate, blood and Ashdown agars).

[2] , and concerned a 63-year-old Frenchman, with no significant past medical history, who lived in Madagascar and made frequent trips to Mayotte, an island between Madagascar and Mozambique. After his admission to Mahajanga Hospital, where he was treated with ofloxacin for cough and fever lasting one week, his condition worsened (vomiting, dehydration, deterioration of consciousness) and he was transferred to an ICU at Saint Denis Hospital, R\u00e9union Island, with septic shock and coma on admission. Briefly, a total body-computed tomography (TB-CT) scan showed multiple bilateral lung abscesses, a liver abscess, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Despite immediate antimicrobial treatment (meropenem, colistin, amikacin), the evolution was marked by multiple organ failure and the patient died on day one. Blood cultures and respiratory samples were positive for a Burkholderia identified as B. thailandensis by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Biotyper, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) but confirmed later as B. pseudomallei by qPCR targeting three genetic markers of the type III secretion system (orf1, orf13, and BsSCU2). It is noteworthy that B. pseudomallei was not at that time included in the IVD MALDI Biotyper database but in a separate database (SR: security-relevant) which was not available at the hospital. The strain was susceptible in vitro to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ceftazidime, and was resistant to meropenem and levofloxacin. The meropenem resistance (MIC = 12 mL/L) was unusual, and the presence of a possible metallo \u03b2-lactamase (MBL) was investigated with the RUO Etest MBL MP/MPI US 8/2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, La Balme-Les-Grottes, France), but failed. The higher MIC values to different antibiotics suggested that this resistance could be due to a non-specific mechanism, such as efflux or impermeability.",

Of historical importance are the postulated links between animal cases in Paris and R\u00e9union Island and the presence of B. pseudomallei in the Antananarivo zoo in the 1970s [6, 8] , which are thought to illustrate the potential for B. pseudomallei to be disseminated across large geographic distances via infected animals or manure. It was previously reported that B. pseudomallei was transported from France to R\u00e9union Island in the 1970s via an infected horse, which became ill with melioidosis after its arrival [6] . Although it has long been assumed that this horse contracted melioidosis in France, molecular characterization of this isolate would help to establish whether the horse in fact acquired B. pseudomallei from the environment in the Indian Ocean. In another instance, MLST characterization of B. pseudomallei isolates has enabled us to identify ST-27 isolates from both the Paris zoo outbreak and a 1977 soil isolate obtained from a zoo in Antananarivo. This previously unreported ST overlap suggests the possibility of transmission of B. pseudomallei between these two regions. However, it is not known whether ST-27 was introduced into France via Madagascar, or vice versa. Another possibility that should be considered is that of laboratory cross-contamination. On a contemporary level, molecular fingerprinting of B. pseudomallei from the western Indian Ocean island region will enhance surveillance measures, public health, and veterinary awareness of the disease, and epidemiological investigation to identify B. pseudomallei 'hotspots'. * Cases #2 and #3 were two nosocomial cases acquired from an endoscope used for Case 1. ** Cases #11 and #12 were two cooks from the same facility, hospitalized at the same time.",

Using WGS data for phylogenomic analyses has also been instrumental in unravelling the early origins of B. pseudomallei in Australia, and its subsequent dissemination to tropical regions across the globe, including the western Indian Ocean region. Three studies to date have used WGS to investigate B. pseudomallei strains from western Indian Ocean islands [19] [20] [21] . Sarovich and colleagues [19] were the first to identify an Asian origin for the Madagascan B. pseudomallei strains included in the phylogenetic analysis. Their study showed that the introduction of this bacterium into Madagascar was likely associated with the migration of Austronesian peoples (or their animals) from Indonesian Borneo approximately 2000 years ago [19] . B. pseudomallei was subsequently transmitted from the western Indian Ocean region to mainland Africa, and then the Americas, during the Atlantic slave trade [19, 20] . The mechanism/s of B. pseudomallei dissemination to other western Indian Ocean islands is not yet well understood, but it is likely that it has also been anthropogenically driven. It is also unknown how many of the Indian Ocean islands harbor B. pseudomallei, with confirmed cases found only in the most populous islands (Madagascar, Mauritius, R\u00e9union Island, and Seychelles). Table 2 presents the ST and alleles for 8/13 cases identified in the western Indian Ocean, as well as for the two soil isolates from the garden of case#10 from Mahajanga, Madagascar. MLST analyses have shown that there is no ST overlap between islands, and the STs identified on these islands are not found elsewhere, with the exception of ST-1053, which has been located in both Madagascar [19] and in an imported American case thought to have originated in Ghana [21] , although the possibility that this patient had travelled to Madagascar cannot be ruled out. It is also important to stress that the ST of case #13 (hospitalized in Saint Denis, La R\u00e9union, but originally from Mahajanga, Madagascar) and E1 (soil from Mahajanga, Madagascar) are identical (ST-1430), indicating the possibility that the Mahajanga environment was the source of infection in case #13.",

Doctors and laboratory staff should know how to confirm the diagnosis and treat the disease. Indeed, the association between rainfall and melioidosis has been well demonstrated in hyperendemic regions, with 75% and 85% of cases occurring during the wet season in northeastern Thailand and northern Australia [22, 23] . The contaminated soil in the garden of case #10 highlights the risk of occupational or recreational exposure to B. pseudomallei, and predisposing risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung or renal diseases, hazardous alcohol use, or thalassaemia, should be considered when gardening or cultivating in endemic zones. Additionally, B. pseudomallei has been reported to infect a wide range of animals, such as horses, sheep, goats, cattle, pigs or cats, with anecdotal reports of transmission from animals to humans [22] . Contaminated secretions and excreta represent a possible source of exposure or environmental contamination. As the bacterium typically enters the body through pre-existing cutaneous lesions, including minor trauma such as insect bites, and develops in the wound, contact with contaminated waste may represent an underestimated source of infection.",

However, healthy people can also get the disease if they are infected with a high bacterial load, such as contact with muddy soil without good hand and foot protection. Clinical manifestations are broad, and range from subclinical infection to localized abscess formation, pneumonia, and systemic sepsis. Pneumonia is the most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain [25] . Melioidosis could easily be confused with tuberculosis or even plague, particularly in Madagascar, where this disease is prevalent, or with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe form of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with underlying risk factors, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving soft tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen. Blood culture is an effective way to diagnose many melioidosis cases, as 50% or more of infections have bacteremia [26] .",

Ten ml of supernatant were removed and were placed into 30 mL of modified Ashdown's broth (+colistin 50 mg/L). After 48 h, 10 \u00b5L of supernatant were spread on modified Ashdown's medium (+gentamicin at 8 mg/L). The plates were examined on a daily basis. Colonies with morphology typical for B. pseudomallei were subcultured onto chocolate agar.B. pseudomallei colonies were identified by basic screening tests (Gram stain, oxidase test), rapid detection of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) produced by B. pseudomallei (Active Melioidosis Detect TM (AMD) rapid test (InBios)) [27] , MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and molecular identification based on the amplification of the B. pseudomallei specific target TTS1 (see below).Water: Sample A10 comprised 1 liter of water from the artesian well. The water was filtered through a membrane (pore size 0.45 \u00b5m, diameter 47 mm) on a filtration ramp (Combisart Multi-Branch Systems Manifolds, Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). The membrane was subsequently placed in Ashdown broth (supplemented with colistin 50 mg/L). After incubation for 48 h, the membrane was transferred onto an Ashdown agar plate (containing gentamicin at 8 mg/L) and incubated for 48 h. No suspicious colonies of B. pseudomallei were detected.",

DNA was eluted in 100 \u00b5L of 10mM Tris HCl. B. pseudomallei DNA was detected by conventional PCR targeting a 115 bp stretch of the B. pseudomallei specific orf2 of type III secretion system (TTS1) as described below. Briefly, 4 \u00b5L of DNA were amplified in duplicates in 25 \u00b5L volumes.",
