It is the etiological agent of several diseases, among which viral arthritis and malabsorption syndrome are the most commercially important, causing considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Although a small but increasing number of reports have characterized some aspects of ARV infection, global changes in protein expression in ARV-infected host cells have not been examined. The current study used a proteomics approach to obtain a comprehensive view of changes in protein levels in host cells upon infection by ARV.",

The majority of protein expression changes ($1.5 fold, p,0.05) occurred at 72 h post-infection. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identified 51 proteins with differential expression levels, including 25 that were upregulated during ARV infection and 26 that were downregulated. These proteins were divided into eight groups according to biological function: signal transduction, stress response, RNA processing, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization. They were further examined by immunoblotting to validate the observed alterations in protein expression.",

In addition, other differentially expressed proteins were linked with the cytoskeleton, metabolism, redox regulation, and stress response. These proteomics data provide valuable information about host cell responses to ARV infection and will facilitate further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying ARV pathogenesis.",

The primary method to control ARV infection in chickens is vaccination, but the vaccines do not protect animals from all antigenic subtypes [2] . The ARV genome contains ten segments of double-stranded RNA that encode at least eight structural proteins (lA, lB, lC, mA, mB, sA, sB, and sC) and four non-structural proteins (mNS, P10, P17, and sNS) [3] . The roles of some of these viral proteins in ARV replication and pathogenesis have been characterized. For instance, outer capsid protein mB is involved in viral entry [4] . Outer capsid protein sC is a cell attachment protein [5] , and overexpression of sC in cultured cells can induce apoptosis [6] . Other studies have shown that the non-structural protein p10 is a multifunctional protein that not only causes syncytium formation in transfected cells [7] , but also enhances membrane permeability [8] . More recent studies have reported a connection between ARV proteins and cellular signaling pathways. For example, non-structural protein p17 triggers autophagy, enhancing viral replication through the PKR/eIF2alpha signaling pathway [9] , and capsid protein sC induces apoptosis via the DNA damage signaling pathway [10] .",

In this study, actin (cytoplasmic type 5) and syndesmos (SDOS) were upregulated in ARV-infected cells, whereas vinculin, vimentin, microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1 (MAPRE1), F-actin-capping protein subunit b isoform 1 and 2 (CAPZB), and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) were downregulated. ARV genomic segment S4 encodes a fusionassociated small transmembrane protein that mediates cell-cell fusion, and this cell fusion activity requires active cellular actin remodeling [32] . Similarly, our immunofluorescence analysis showed that the cellular actin cytoskeleton of DF-1 cells was dramatically restructured/disordered at 48 and 72 h after ARV infection (Fig. 2) . Thus, the rearrangement of actin filament structure may play an important role in facilitating ARV infection processes.",

These results are similar to what has been observed in HIVinfected T cells [40] , although the metabolism-related proteins involved are not identical. Upregulation of energy-associated proteins may promote ARV replication and other energydependent biological processes [41] .

An earlier study found a gradual increase in ROS during ARV S1133 infection of DF1 cells [10] .

GAPDH also contributes to various other non-glycolytic processes, including nuclear membrane fusion [45] , microtubule binding [46] , RNA transport, and apoptosis [47] . GAPDH may also play a direct role in the viral life cycle. GAPDH has been shown to physically interact with RNA from Japanese encephalitis [48] , hepatitis A [49] and parainfluenza viruses [50] .

This result suggests that ARV turns off the host cell translation apparatus and initiates viral translation, consistent with the recent report that ARV non-structural protein p17 inactivation of host cell protein translation involves eIF2a and eEF2 [25] . Moreover, upregulation of RPSA has also been observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-and IBDV-infected cells, suggesting that it may play a role in the viral multiplication process in host cells.

The host UPP also appears to be required for virion development, progeny release, and effective replication of some viruses [54] . In our study, three UPP-related proteins were downregulated by ARV infection: proteasome activator complex subunit (PSME3), proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit a type 3 (PSMA3), and 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (PSMD13). ARV infection has previously been shown to cause apoptosis and enhance p53 expression [55] . In addition, PSME3 inhibits apoptosis and promotes MDM2-mediated p53 degradation [56] . The downregulation of PSME3 that we observed suggests that ARV infection likely reduces MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 in DF-1 cells and promotes apoptosis. Decreases in PSME3 have also been observed in IBDV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts [12] and H1N1 influenza virus2infected porcine alveolar macrophages [57] . In addition, PSMA3 and PSMD13 appear to physically interact in human cells [58] . Our data suggest that ARV infection causes functional impairment of the cellular UPP to facilitate viral progeny release.",

In our study, downregulated peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) and upregulated peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) were observed during ARV infection. Previous study indicated that transient transfection of liver cells with PRDX6 siRNA resulted in a rise in peroxide-induced cytotoxicity by apoptosis, implying that suppression of PRDX6 promotes apoptosis [60] . Therefore, the downregulation of PRDX6 here we observed suggests that ARV infection decreases the anti-apoptotic function for PRDX6. On the other hand, upregulation of PRDX4 has been detected in respiratory syncytial virus-infected human pulmonary epithelial cells, suggesting that PRDX4 may play an important role to protect nuclear proteins against respiratory syncytial virus-induced oxidative stress [61] .",

ANXA5 is anticipated in many cellular processes, such as signaling transduction, membrane trafficking, blood coagulation regulation, and shielding exposed phospholipids (REF15576370). SUMOylation is a post-translational modification, which covalent conjugated with ubiquitin-like proteins named SUMO-1, -2, and -3 to target proteins (12672486). Previous study has indicated that MDM2 can promote SUMO-2 and -3 modification of P53 to both activate and repress some P53-target genes (PMC3218624). To our knowledge, decreased expression levels of ANXA5 and SUMO3 proteins have not been reported in virus-infected cells. The reason of downregulated ANXA5 and SUMO3 at late stage of ARV infection is still unclear. Our data suggest that decrease in SUMO3 reduces the conjugation of P53 and promotes apoptosis in ARV infected DF-1 cells.",

ARV sC is known to induce apoptosis in cultured cells [17] through p53 and the mitochondria-mediated pathway [62] . Upregulation of sC in this study suggests that it also promotes apoptosis in DF-1 cells. HSPD1 is a mitochondrial chaperonin that promotes pro-caspase-3 maturation and regulates apoptosis [63] . HSPD1 is also upregulated in cells infected with H1N1 influenza virus [57] . Moreover, the pro-apoptotic protein VDAC2 is a mitochondrial porin [64] that regulates cell permeability and appears to cause swelling of the mitochondrial matrix in Nipah virus2infected cells [65] . A viral protein from another chicken dsRNA virus, IBDV, has also been shown to induce apoptosis in DF-1 cells through interaction with VDAC2 [66] , but a specific interaction between ARV proteins and VDAC2 has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic protein YWHAB, which was downregulated by ARV in our study, is thought to play a crucial role in the anti-viral innate immune response [67] . These ARV-induced changes in apoptosis regulating proteins are similar to those observed in HIV-infected T cells [40] .",
