Present stochastic strategies are mainly evaluated based on classical network models, such as scale-free networks and small-world networks, and thus are insufficient. Three frequently referred stochastic immunization strategies-acquaintance immunization, community-bridge immunization, and ring vaccination-were analyzed in this work. The optimal immunization ratios for acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization strategies were investigated, and the effectiveness of these three strategies in controlling the spreading of epidemics were analyzed based on realistic social contact networks. The results show all the strategies have decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to baseline scenario (no control measures). However the effectiveness of acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization are very limited, with acquaintance immunization slightly outperforming community-bridge immunization. Ring vaccination significantly outperforms acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization, and the sensitivity analysis shows it could be applied to controlling the epidemics with a wide infectivity spectrum. The effectiveness of several classical stochastic immunization strategies was evaluated based on realistic contact networks for the first time in this study. These results could have important significance for epidemic control research and practice.",

In recent years, newly emerging diseases have been identified with an unprecedented rate of one or more per year [1] . Meanwhile, highly developed transportation systems have intensified the large-scale spreading trend of the epidemics thus highlights the urgent demand for the research on effective control strategies. For many directly person-to-person transmitted diseases, such as HIV/ AIDS, SARS and the influenza, network models could capture the specific contact patterns which could possibly lead to a successful transmission of the diseases between individuals and thus provide an effective way to forecast the potential epidemic dynamics and explore the intervention measures. In network models, the individuals are described as nodes (vertices) and the contacts between these individuals are described as edges (links). Seeded in a random selected node, the epidemic can be spread along the interconnections among vertices. The initial infected nodes will proceed to the infectious period after a short time after being infected, during when they could spread the infection to their contact nodes, and the newly infected nodes could then infect their linked vertices, and so on.",

            "text": "Effective control of infectious diseases requires quantitative comparisons of several interventions, such as quarantine, infection control precautions, case identification and isolation, and immunization. The success of an intervention depends on the infectivity of the diseases and the contact patterns of the population [2] . Network models define the detailed contact structure of the population, which would be conducive to the effectiveness assessment of different interventions, therefore they are widely applied to the study of immunization strategies. Several immunization strategies have been proposed based on network models. These strategies include both deterministic algorithms based on global network information, such as maximum-degree node immunization [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , maximum-betweenness node immunization [8, 9] and long-range travelers immunization [10, 11] , and stochastic algorithms based on local network information, such as ring vaccination [12] [13] [14] , acquaintance immunization [15] and community-bridge immunization [16] . Although studies have shown that deterministic immunization strategies regularly outperform stochastic immunization strategies in controlling the epidemics [16] , the realistic global network information is usually or even constantly unavailable in the infectious diseases control practice. Therefore the stochastic immunization strategies and their optimizations have long been the research hotspots. However, the effectiveness assessment of the stochastic immunization strategies mentioned above is almost entirely made based on classical network models, such as scale-free networks [17] and small-world networks [18] . Although these network models have partly described the characteristics of realistic networks, there are still many differences among them, thus the real effectiveness of stochastic immunization strategies mentioned above has not been performed clearly.",

AI strategy is defined as follows: first, selecting n random nodes from the network; second, for each chosen node, immunizing a random neighbor. A node with k connections will be targeted as the immunization node with the probability q~kP k \u00f0 \u00de= NSkT \u00f0 \u00de [15] , where SkT~P k kP k \u00f0 \u00de is the average degree. Therefore, for any susceptible individual, it will enter into the controlled set and proceed to class V with the probability q. For each infectious individual, it will enter into the controlled set and proceed to class D with the probability q 1{r \u00f0 \u00de (second-order detection). Notice that the probability of direct detection is r, so class I individual will proceed to class D with the total probability rzq 1{r \u00f0 \u00de. For individuals in other states (V, R and D), no influences were demonstrated on the spreading of the epidemics, so no processing was made.",

R 0 is one of the most important contributions of mathematics to epidemiology and it has provided a metric to evaluate the risk of the outbreaks of the epidemics in the population. Only infectious diseases with R 0 w1could possibly lead to a potential outbreak. The infectivity levels of infectious diseases may differ considerably.

This difference is understandable because of the report of the respondents might miss some regular contacts and most random contacts. The comparison to the social networks from Facebook [16] shows that their average degree is close. The average clustering coefficient [18] is C~0:54 and the modularity [31] is Q~0:82. High heterogeneity was observed when taking the individual contact frequency (degree) into consideration, shown in Figure 2a .

However, for CBI, the immunized individuals are those targeted as community-bridge nodes by community-bridge find algorithm, which might be finite in the network. Take the sub network in Figure 3c as an example, according to the community-bridge find algorithm, node 1 and 5 are community-bridge nodes, i.e., potential immunization targets, while node 2, 3 and 4 are impossible to be targeted as immunization nodes. Therefore for any specific social contact network, there will be a ceiling immunization ratio f c for CBI. f~f c implies all the communitybridge nodes will be immunized. The realistic immunization ratio will always be less than f c . Figure 3a and Figure 3b show the convergent trajectories of the optimal immunization ratio obtained by binary search method.

All these three immuniza-tion strategies were demonstrated to have successfully decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to the scenario with no control measures (no control measures) in Figure 5a . A further comparative analysis of the difference in the fraction of susceptible individuals with respect to time steps between each pair of strategies were made in Figure 5b . Take the comparison between AI and NO as an example, the intersections between the horizontal line related to (AI -NO) and the contour lines show that (AI -NO) is negative in the early stage of the epidemics because of the dramatic decrease of the susceptible individuals resulting from the immunization after the outbreak of the diseases for AI. This phenomenon could also be observed in the scenario for CBI. With the evolution of the epidemics, the susceptible individuals will decrease more rapidly for NO than for AI, so (AI -NO) will become positive. The difference peaked around t~150 and then decreased, and was eventually positive, indicating that AI had decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to NO. Similar analytics could be applied to other pair strategies (CBI -AI), (RV -CBI) and (RV -AI). Figure 5b shows AI outperforms CBI and RV significantly outperforms CBI and AI under the definition of the objective function T~RzV .",

All the contour lines slope downwards, indicating the coverage of the epidemics increases with the increase of R 0 for all the three strategies. For RV, the declining rate of the contour lines decreases, indicating the number of susceptible individuals decreases more slowly. Therefore, RV is more effective compared to AI and CBI. More straightforward comparisons of the effectiveness of these three strategies with different R 0 were given in Figure 8d to Figure 8h . With the increase of R 0 , the affected individuals will increase for all the strategies, however, the decrease of susceptible individuals for RV is significantly slower than for AI and CBI, i.e., RV notably outperforms AI and CBI.

We found that there exists an optimal immunization ratio for AI and CBI for a specific r which leads to a minimum number of individuals infected and immunized. This optimal immunization ratio decreases with the increase of r and could be determined by the binary search method. For RV, the case detection rate, the contact trace escape rate and the contact trace lag are three most important factors. The effectiveness of RV improves with the increase of the case detection rate, while decreases with the increase of the contact escape rate and the contact trace lag. The comparison of the effectiveness of these three strategies shows AI, CBI and RV have decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to a baseline scenario (no control measures, NO), however the effectiveness of AI and CBI are very limited, between which AI outperforms CBI. RV is very effective in controlling the epidemics and its effectiveness significantly outperforms AI and CBI.",

With the increase of the basic reproductive number R 0 , the coverage of the epidemics will increase for all these three strategies, however the increase of the number of class R and class V individuals for RV is much less than for AI and CBI, indicating that RV notably outperforms AI and CBI. Even when R 0 reaches 6.0, the effectiveness of RV is prominent, implying that RV could be applied to controlling the epidemics with a wide infectivity spectrum. We found that RV is a newly confirmed case-triggered and locally controlled strategy, so RV is more acceptable in infectious disease control practice, which will improve the effectiveness of RV in return. However, AI and CBI are epidemic-triggered and global controlled strategies. These control strategies call for large control resources due to a relatively high immunization ratio as analyzed in the main text, also the allocation and the logistics of the resources might be a problem. Moreover, the global control strategies might encounter the resistance of the public, so the effectiveness could be worse. Although the social contact network used in this research is just one instance for Portland urban population, it is the first time the effectiveness of several classical immunization stochastic immunization strategies are evaluated based on realistic contact networks. These results could have significant importance for epidemic control research and practice.",
