Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies against PEDV is an effective prevention measure. In this study, single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against PEDV were screened from the porcine scFv phage display library. After four rounds of biopanning, scFvs that showed higher affinity to the PEDV antigen were selected for further study. The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection. virulent variants emphasizes the importance of developing an effective method to control their spread and infection.",

The S protein can be cleaved into S1 (residues 1-789) and S2 subunits (residues 790-1386) by host protease [16] . The S1 subunit contains the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-233) that shows sialic acid binding activity and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 253-638) that attaches to the cell surface receptor (e.g., aminopeptidase N (APN)) [17]. The S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [16] . S protein is an excellent target for vaccine development for the induction of protective immunity against PEDV. Several studies have confirmed that antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies stimulated by the vaccine expressing spike protein, are able to protect the host from PEDV infection [18, 19] . Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against PEDV can be developed as candidates for passive protection. Lee et al. reported that egg yolk antibody (IgY) against S1 domain of spike protein efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, supporting the potential of antibody reagents as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to protect piglets against PEDV infection [20] .",

The single chain fragment variable (ScFv), also called single-chain antibody, is one of the most popular types of genetically engineered antibodies [21, 22] . The scFv consists of a variable light chain (V L ) and heavy chain (V H ) that are connected by a short peptide linker [23] . The advantages of scFv are its small size, low immunogenicity, high specificity, and ability to be genetically engineered. The scFv can be produced in bacterial expression systems for large-scale production. Although scFv is smaller than full-length IgG, it retains the complete antigen binding site [24] . Several scFvs have been produced to control virus infection, including scFvs against chicken infectious bursal disease virus, scFvs targeting human influenza virus H5N1, and scFvs against the phosphoprotein of Newcastle disease virus [25] [26] [27] [28] .

The qPCR reaction was carried on an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 58 \u2022 C for 30 min, followed by an initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 60 \u2022 C for 1 min. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1 . The detection limit of the assay was determined by generating standard curves from serial 10-fold dilutions of known amounts of in vitro-transcribed RNA (1 \u00d7 10 12 ) for the qPCR. The standard curve for PEDV qPCR has a slope of \u22123.462, indicating that the amplification efficiency was 94.47%. The detection limit was calculated as 1000 RNA copies per mL. The viral genome copy numbers per mL were determined, and each sample was assessed in triplicate.",

Since PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 showed neutralizing effects on PEDV infection, we further clarified whether these scFvs could specifically recognize the spike protein. Our lab has previously constructed the eukaryotic expressing vector harboring full-length spike protein (pCDNA3.1-PEDV-S). However, pCDNA3.1-PEDV-S transfected cells showed weak fluorescence, as observed by IFA. To solve this problem, we constructed pCDNA3.1-PEDV-S1 and pCDNA3.1-PEDV-S2 expressing the S1 domain and S2 domain of spike protein, respectively. The expression of these plasmids was confirmed by the IFA assay using anti-PEDV polyclonal antibody. As shown in Figure 2 , all scFvs reacted with S1 protein but not with S2 protein or pCDNA3.1 (+) empty vector. These results indicated that PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 specifically bound to the S1 domain of S protein to neutralize viral infection (Figure 2 ). and S2 domain of spike protein, respectively. The expression of these plasmids was confirmed by the IFA assay using anti-PEDV polyclonal antibody. As shown in Figure 2 , all scFvs reacted with S1 protein but not with S2 protein or pCDNA3.1 (+) empty vector.

Even though many swine populations have been immunized with the classical vaccine CV777, it could only provide limited cross-neutralizing activity in swine populations against new variant strains, thus leading to immunity failure [38] . The strain used in the present study was isolated from piglets showing typical PED clinical symptoms. It belongs to the genotype of new variant strains, representing epidemic and pandemic field strains in China.

            "text": "The traditional strategy to protect piglets from PEDV infection is to immunize pregnant sows with inactivated or attenuated vaccines [39] . Neutralizing antibodies are produced in the colostrum or milk of sows, and newborn piglets are passively protected from PEDV when they suckle immune dams (lactogenic immunity) [3, 40] . Although these vaccines are widely used and considered to be effective, not all sows develop solid lactogenic immunity due to the immunization route of the vaccine, and sucking pigs are still vulnerable to infection unless they obtain adequate maternal antibodies from the milk [19, 41] . Additionally, this method does not provide protection to postweaned piglets. PEDV-specific antibodies are rapidly lost in postweaned piglets, and they become susceptible to PEDV. Moreover, amino acid sequence mutations in the new variant strains will cause immunization failure of commercial vaccines [42] . Based on these aspects, feeding foreign antibodies (passive immunization) to piglets is more suitable than vaccination to prevent neonatal diarrheal diseases. Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) from chickens immunized with PEDV antigen has been administered to piglets, and the results showed that IgY is able to reduce mortality in piglets after challenge exposures [20] . Although IgY prepared from immunized chickens has the characteristics of high affinity, a large yield, and a simple isolation process, the production cost of high-quality IgY for large-scale applications still remains higher than that of commercial antibiotics or vaccine [43] . Since IgY is of chicken origin, it might cause immunogenic side effects in the host.",

Since the host immune system was stimulated by the specific pathogen in PEDV-induced pigs, the abundant and mature antibodies were biased against PEDV [44] . After four rounds of biopanning, three scFvs with high affinity to PEDV were successfully screened. The predicted amino acid sequences of these two scFvs were aligned and analyzed. The results showed that the variation in the complementary determining regions (CDRs) were significantly greater than in the framework regions (FRs). The lengths of CDR3 in the V L and V H were not equal among the three scFvs, indicating the presence of amino acid insertions or deletions in these regions. Since CDRs contribute to the specificity of binding to a specific epitope, differences in the diversity of CDRs in the V L and V H domains may reflect the different binding epitopes of these scFvs.",

This procedure may not be feasible in many cases where a single epitope is recognized, but it can be achieved when more than one epitope is recognized on the viral surface. In this study, we mixed three scFv in a cocktail to investigate whether the combination of these scFvs would have a better effect on the neutralization of viral infection compared with their use alone. The results showed that virus neutralization titer of a cocktail of scFvs was 3.125 \u00b5g/mL and neutralization titer of the individual scFv was 6.25 \u00b5g/mL or 12.5 \u00b5g/mL.

We analyzed whether PZZ 21, PZZ 24 and PZZ 35 bind to PEDV spike protein to inhibit viral infection. The IFA assay and additive ELISA confirmed that all three scFvs reacted with different epitopes of S1 the domain but not the S2 domain. Previous reports have shown that the main neutralizing epitopes of S protein are located in the S1 domain [47, 48] , and two neutralizing domains have been identified in the S1 region, including NTD/S0 [49] , COE (aa 499-636) [50] , and S1D (aa 636-789) [48] . The exact epitopes recognized by these scFvs need further elucidation by pepscan ELISAs. Previous studies have reported that the major genetic variations of PEDV are concentrated in the S1 portion of the S gene, especially in the N-terminus of the S1 gene [51] . Even a single amino acid mutation in this region can change the structure of the spike protein, which may explain why current vaccine strains fail to protect piglets from new emerging variant strains [52] . Our study has confirmed that these scFvs neutralize PEDV by targeting to the S1 domain. Whether these three scFvs also influence PEDV CV777 replication, or just specifically recognize unique epitope on the variant strain, this still need further study.",

Piglets inoculated with a cocktail of scFvs survived after challenge with virulent PEDV, and piglets treated with PBS followed by PEDV infection showed 100% mortality, suggesting that scFvs provides effective passive immunity to viral infection. Piglets treated with scFvs showed no to moderate diarrhea, and the intestinal mucosa remained intact under histological examination, indicating the scFvs could block the virus from invading the small intestine. The effect of scFvs is slightly influenced by the low pH and enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration. To solve these problems, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticulates such as chitosan and its derivatives that can protect proteins from degradation may be a prospective strategy for oral delivery [53] . Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of chitosan-based nanoparticle as carriers for the oral delivery of antimicrobial peptide [54] , bacteriophages [55] , antigens [56] and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [57] . Currently, we are focusing on the selection of suitable chitosan derivatives to protect scFvs from enzymatic degradation and modulate scFvs pharmacokinetics to improve their efficacy.",
