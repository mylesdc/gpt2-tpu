            "text": "In the present study, anti-IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) activities of (-)pinenes were studied by MTT assay, as well as docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The CC 50 values of (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene were above 10 mM. And the maximum noncytotoxic concentrations (TD 0 ) of (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene were determined as 7.88 \u00b1 0.06 and 6.09 \u00b1 0.31 mM, respectively. The two compounds were found to inhibit IBV with an IC 50 of 0.98 \u00b1 0.25 and 1.32 \u00b1 0.11 mM. The MTT assay showed that the inhibitions of (-)-pinenes against IBV appear to occur moderately before entering the cell but are much stronger occur after penetration of the virus into the cell. Molecular simulations indicated that (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene specifically interact with the active site which is located at the N terminus of phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, with the former being more potent than the latter. The binding energies of them are \u221236.83 and \u221235.59 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively. Results presented here may suggest that (-)-\u03b1pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene possess anti-IBV properties, and therefore are a potential source of anti-IBV ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.",

Two thirds of the coronavirus genome encodes the replicase activity, including a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and viral proteinases. The remaining one third of the genome encodes the structural proteins and small group-specific ORFs [1] .

The E and M proteins are localized in ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and considered to play critical roles in viral budding [6, 7] . N proteins, which interact with viral genomic RNA, forming ribonucleocapsid (RNP) complexes, have been associated with replication and transcription [8] [9] [10] . It is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein also implicated in viral genome replication and in modulating cell signaling pathways. The N-terminal of N-protein (NTD) serves as a functional unit critical for the specific interaction with RNA, where exhibits a U-shaped structure, with two arms rich in basic residues [11] . Additionally, the key functional residues of NTD are highly conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups [12] [13] [14] .

            "text": "To identify at which step replication might be inhibited, cells were infected with IBV after preincubation of the cells with ribavirin as positive control or pinenes, pretreatment of the virus with ribavirin or pinenes prior to infection, addition of the synthetic antiviral drug or pinenes during adsorption or after adsorption during the intracellular replication period. In all experiments cells infected with untreated virus were used as control. The percent reduction was calculated relative to the amount of virus produced in the absence of the drug. As shown in Figure 2 , ribavirin showed the maximum antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 0.78 \u00b1 0.15 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 90.18 \u00b1 2.80% for IBV. As is commonly known, ribavirin interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication [23] . However, no significant effect was detected when ribavirin was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when ribavirin was only added during the adsorption phase. Unlike ribavirin, (-)-\u03b1-pinene showed the maximum noncytotoxic antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 7.88 \u00b1 0.06 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 86.98 \u00b1 3.04% for IBV, whereas, it also showed inhibition of 67.64 \u00b1 2.31% in the pretreatment virus phase. Similarly to (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene also showed significant anti-IBV inhibition during the replication period and pretreatment virus phase, with the inhibition of 81.02 \u00b1 1.48% and 55.41 \u00b1 1.64%. These results suggested that the inhibitions of (-)-pinenes against IBV appear to moderately occur before entering the cell but much stronger occur after penetration of the virus into the cell. Additionally, biochemical studies indicated that the bioactivity of N protein is an important target for the replication of IBV virus [11, 13, 16] . Hence, we infer that N protein may be suppressed by (-)-pinenes. Cells were pretreated with (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene or ribavirin prior to virus infection (pretreatment cells), viruses were pretreated prior to infection (pretreatment virus), and (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene or ribavirin was added during the adsorption period (adsorption) or after penetration of the viruses into cells (replication). Experiments were repeated independently three times and data presented are the average of 3 experiments. The symbols * and # indicated very significant difference p < 0.01 with respect to positive control (ribavirin).",

Further studies on the anti-IBV mechanism are needed to support this point of view.

            "text": "As shown in Figure 3 , total energies and backbone-atom RMSDs indicated that the two docked complexes reached equilibrium after about 1,000 ps and remained rather stable afterwards. Accordingly, the geometric and energetic analyses were performed on the average structures of 1,000~5,000 ps MD trajectories. The superposed structures in Figure 4 showed that (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene occupy the proximity space at the RNA binding site of NTD, which is mapped to the loop region on the top of the \u03b2-sheet within the protein [11, 14] . However, their binding modes differed from each other. The interaction energy (E inter ) of (-)-\u03b1-pinene with NTD was calculated to be -36.83 kcal mol -1 . Van der Waals interactions rather than electrostatic interactions played a dominant role for the binding process, contributing to almost 86%. As Figure 4 shows, the cyclohexene ring of (-)-\u03b1-pinene was sandwiched between residues TyrA92 and ProA134 and exerted strong interactions with them. The values (E sum ) amounted to \u22126.32 and \u22122.65 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively (Table 2) . Besides, (-)-\u03b1-pinene had strong van der Waals interactions (E vdW ) with residues SerA34, GlnA37, PheA137, AspA138, GlnA139, GlyB147 and ProB149, especially residues PheA137 and ProB149, where the values were equaling \u22122.66 and \u22122.30 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). As these fully or partially conserved residues are key for the RNA bindings [11, 14, 16] , it commendably support a viewpoint that (-)-\u03b1-pinene hindered the binding of RNA with NTD, which is in good agreement with the inhibition occurred strongly after penetration of the virus into the host cells. Similarly, the binding of (-)-\u03b2-pinene was mainly stabilized by van der Waals interactions. The interaction energy (E inter ) of (-)-\u03b2-pinene with NTD was slightly reduced to \u221235.59 kcal mol \u22121 , with van der Waals energy (E vdW ) owning 98% of it. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 , the strong van der Waals effects were also observed between cyclohexane ring of (-)-\u03b2-pinene and the residues TyrA92 and ProA134 (Figure 4 ). Table 2 . The vdW, electrostatic and sum interaction energies (E vdW , E ele and E sum ) involving (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene with the active-site residues of nucleocapsid (N) protein a . The van der Waals contributions (E vdW ) of the two residues were calculated to be \u22123.45 and \u22122.96 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively ( Table 2 ). The maximal binding difference between (-)-\u03b1-pinene-NTD and (-)\u03b2-pinene-NTD is in that the methylene group (=CH 2 ) of (-)-\u03b2-pinene was oriented towards residue AlaA33. As a result of this situation, the van der Waals contributions (E vdW ) of residues PheA137 and ProB149 sharply reduced to \u22122.00 and \u22120.63 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively. It indicated that the binding of RNA may interfer with (-)-\u03b2-pinene and this effect is lower than that of (-)-\u03b1-pinene, consistent with the above experimental data.",

After 1h of adsorption at 37 \u00b0C, the inoculum was removed and DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS were added to the cells. The effect of (-)-\u03b1-pinene or (-)-\u03b2-pinene (or ribavirin) against IBV was also tested during the replication period by adding it after adsorption, as typical performed in anti-IBV susceptibility studies. Each assay was run in eight replicates. Ribavirin was used as a positive control.",

For convenience, it is named as NTD throughout this work. The geometries and partial atomic charges of (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene ( Figure 1 ) were taken by applying the BFGS algorithm (Discover 3.0 module) [26] , with the consistent-valence force-field (CVFF). The convergence criterion was set to 0.01 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22121 . Demonstrated by previous literatures [14, [27] [28] [29] , the explicitly solvated flexible docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by the general and popular protocols in the InsightII 2005 software packages [30] on Linux workstations. The MD trajectories were generated using a 1.0-fs time step for a total of 5,000 ps, saved at 5.0-ps intervals. The interaction energies of the compounds with NTD and the respective residues at the NTD active site were calculated by the Docking module [31] , over the 1,000~5,000 ps MD trajectories. More calculated details are referred elsewhere [27, 29] .",
