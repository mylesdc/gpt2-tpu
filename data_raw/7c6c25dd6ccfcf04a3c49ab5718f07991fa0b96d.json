The onset of cachexia is associated with reduced tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatments, eventually leading to clinical conditions that are not compatible with survival. Among the mechanisms underlying cachexia, protein and energy dysmetabolism play a major role. In this regard, several potential treatments have been proposed, mainly on the basis of promising results obtained in preclinical models. However, at present, no treatment yet reached validation to be used in the clinical practice, although several drugs are currently tested in clinical trials for their ability to improve muscle metabolism in cancer patients. Along this line, the results obtained in both experimental and clinical studies clearly show that cachexia can be effectively approached by a multidirectional strategy targeting nutrition, inflammation, catabolism, and inactivity at the same time. In the present study, approaches aimed to modulate muscle metabolism in cachexia will be reviewed.",

Two main reasons account for such delay: (i) autophagy was not considered as typically operated by the skeletal muscle as a response to stress conditions. Such belief was definitely abandoned when autophagy was clearly demonstrated in fasted mice overexpressing green fluorescent protein- labeled LC3 [13] . (ii) The study and detection of autophagy was not easy since the ATG genes were not discovered [14] . A number of studies reported that the autophagic system was overactivated, without reaching complete cargo degradation, in the muscle of both tumor-bearing animals and cancer patients [6, [15] [16] [17] . In particular, despite autophagic flux was enhanced in mice bearing the C26 tumor, autophagosomes accumulated, likely due to exhaustion of the lysosomal compartment [15] . A similar pattern could also be observed in cancer patients, as suggested by LC3B-II and p62 accumulation [16, 17] . Both proteasome and lysosomes, however, cannot directly degrade intact myofilaments. In this regard, a preliminary cleavage was proposed to be operated by other proteolytic systems, such as those dependent on caspases or calpains. These latter are Ca 2+ -dependent cysteine proteases, normally inactive and localized in the cytosolic compartment. When intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations increase, inactive calpains translocate to the cell membrane and become activated by autoproteolysis [18] . The system also includes calpastatin, a physiological inhibitor, which is a substrate of active calpain itself. Increased calpain expression was reported in the muscle of tumor-bearing animals [19] , while rats transplanted with the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma showed a progressive reduction of calpastatin levels and increased in vitro cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates [20] . More recently, calpain activation was also demonstrated in mice bearing the C26 colon carcinoma [21] . Both increased or unchanged muscle calpain expression were reported in cancer patients [12, 22] .",

The other way round, excessive stimulation of muscle autophagy, experimentally obtained by the overexpression of TP53INP2/ DOR, exacerbated muscle atrophy in tumor-bearing mice (unpublished data), while activation of autophagy by means of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was shown to positively affect the skeletal muscle in the C26 hosts [16] .

Due to the rapid development of cachexia, tumor-bearing animals frequently show reduced protein synthesis rates, although this is not a general finding. Indeed, rats bearing the AH-130 hepatoma, that usually die about 10 days after tumor transplantation, showed muscle protein synthesis rates comparable to those of healthy animals [38] . The situation is more complex when studying human pathology. Reduced muscle protein synthesis was reported many years ago in patients affected by different types of tumors [39] and more recently in prostate cancer patients [40] . On the contrary, van Dijk et al. [41] reported that baseline protein synthesis rates were higher than control values in cachectic patients affected by pancreatic cancer. Also, intermediate results are available in the literature: myofibrillar protein synthesis rates were analyzed in healthy people and weight-stable and weight-losing gastrointestinal cancer patients and found comparable among the different groups. Similarly, no changes in whole body protein synthesis were reported in NSCLC patients [42] .",

Inhibition of mTOR signaling in cancer cachexia is enforced by proinflammatory cytokines [1] . Reduced amino acid uptake in the muscle was also reported to derive from altered amino acid transport. Indeed, in the soleus muscle of tumor-bearing rats, the activity of system A was decreased, while no changes were observed for systems L and ASC [54] . Of interest, TNF\u03b1 was shown to impair amino acid transport in tumor-bearing rats [55] .

A central point in this regard is played by muscle mitochondria compartment, which is markedly affected in tumor hosts. Indeed, both morphological [72, 73] and functional alterations [74, 75] were reported in experimental tumor-bearing animals. In particular, mitochondrial uncoupling and reduced oxidative capacity were associated with myofiber shift from oxidative to glycolytic fibers [73] . Impairment of the mitochondrial compartment results in decreased ATP production, leading to an energy deficit that becomes even worse since it is coupled with steadily increased REE. Consistently, reduced ATP levels and increased activity of the energy sensor AMPK were shown in the muscle of tumor-bearing animals [72, 73] . The lack of an appropriate energy supply results in compromised cell function and reduced contractile force generation, leading to loss of muscle mass and strength.",

Similar observations were reported when other inflammation-driven pathways such as the IL-6/STAT3 or TGF\u03b2/Smad3 are activated above physiological levels [76] . In addition to proinflammatory mediators, also oxidative stress, due to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels exceeding the compensative capacity of the intracellular antioxidant systems, contributes to mitochondrial function impairment.

In this regard, the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, was shown to be reduced in the skeletal muscle of tumorbearing mice [78] , although this is not a constant finding [73, 79] . Mitochondria dynamics, representing the balance between fission and fusion processes, was shown to be altered in both experimental cancer cachexia and in cancer patients [78, 80] . In this regard, impaired mitochondrial dynamics could drive the hyperactivation of muscle protein breakdown, likely through pathways depending on AMPK and FoxO, eventually leading to muscle wasting [81, 82] .",

The first and perhaps simplest one, in theory at least, is exercise training, in particular a combination of both resistance and endurance exercise. These two types of training affect different but complementary targets, being able to improve force production and metabolic adaptations, respectively. Of particular relevance is the observation that endurance training was reported to increase the number of mitochondria and to drive myofiber-type shift from glycolytic to oxidative, thus specifically targeting alterations that characteristically occur in the skeletal muscle of tumor hosts. However, these potentially favorable effects can be exploited just systematically practicing exercise, even if at a moderate level. This may not be an easy task in cancer patients that frequently present with chronic fatigue and comorbidities eventually leading to exercise intolerance. This point is supported by the observation that C26-bearing mice did not benefit from exercise training, suggesting that the effort to exercise in already compromised animals was damaging rather than protective [73] . Consistently, excessive endurance exercise was associated with increased mitochondrial fission in the absence of mitophagy induction [83] .",

This drug also revealed able to activate autophagy and to improve muscle phenotype in both dystrophic mdx mice and animals bearing the C26 tumor [16, 90] . Metformin administration was shown to improve sarcopenia of aging and muscle wasting in severely burned patients [91, 92] and was proposed to be useful to treat muscle wasting in cancer cachexia [93] . AMPK activation can also be induced by resveratrol, as demonstrated by the observation that AMPK\u03b1 1 -or AMPK\u03b1 2 -deficient mice were refractory to resveratrol-induced increase of both mitochondrial biogenesis and endurance exercise capacity [94] . Consistently, obese men receiving resveratrol showed improved inflammation, AMPK activation, and increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and SIRT1 protein levels [95] . Finally, an AMPK-stabilizing peptide was reported to improve white adipose tissue wasting in tumor hosts [96] . SIRT1 belongs to a class of deacetylases deregulated in aging and in different chronic diseases, including cancer. SIRT1 is also involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis; its expression is induced in response to caloric restriction [97] and can be activated in the skeletal muscle by AMPK [98] . Specific overexpression of SIRT1 in the muscle resulted in a fast-to-slow myofiber type transition, producing an oxidative phenotype. Consistently, muscle-specific SIRT1 transgenic mice exposed to fasting or denervation showed a reduced expression of atrogenes in comparison with wildtype littermates [99] . Finally, improved muscle phenotype was reported in mdx/SIRT1 double transgenic mice [100] . In addition to AMPK, resveratrol also activates SIRT1. In this regard, part of the above-described effects exerted by resveratrol derive from SIRT1-dependent modulations of PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation state [101] . Synthetic selective SIRT1 activators such as SRT2104 are also available [102, 103] . Plasma lipid profile and insulin sensitivity were improved in healthy volunteers by administration of SRT2104 [102, 104] . Very few studies are actually available about SRT2104 action on both muscle mass and function. In this regard, SRT2104 appeared to reduce the depletion of muscle mass due to fasting or inactivity [105] , at least in part by increasing PGC-1\u03b1 expression [105] .",

Indeed, ATP synthesis through fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation requires more oxygen than glucose oxidation [106] . Along this line, the shift to glucose oxidation improves the use of the available oxygen, possibly increasing metabolic efficiency and skeletal muscle function. TMZ was shown to increase the size of cultured myotubes [107] and to improve both heart metabolism and exercise capacity in patients suffering from chronic stable angina [108] . When administered to aged animals, TMZ resulted in increased muscle strength [109] . Finally, treatment of C26-bearing mice with TMZ resembled some of the benefits triggered by exercise, among which fast-to-slow myofiber phenotype shift, PGC-1\u03b1 upregulation, oxidative metabolism enhancement, and grip strength increase (Molinari et al., unpublished). The relevance of fatty acid oxidation to cachexia is also supported by a recent study showing that several tumor cell lines are able to release proinflammatory mediators, resulting in enhanced fatty acid oxidation and activation of p38-dependent signaling in the skeletal muscle, well before tissue wasting occurs. In addition, the same study also showed that treatment of tumor-bearing animals with etomoxir, an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, rescued both muscle mass and body weight [110] .",

In this regard, the view of a multidirectional approach, selectively tailored and, whenever possible, personalized, is gaining a growing consensus. Such an approach should not just rely on nutritional counseling and pharmacologic treatment with anti-inflammatory and anticatabolic drugs but also include exercise training and/or exercisemimicking agents. In this regard, exercise mimetics could not only merely replace exercise training in depleted patients but also improve exercise tolerance and effectiveness in precachectic individuals, thus amplifying the beneficial action of exercise itself. Last but not least, treatments aimed at preventing/correcting the metabolic alterations underlying cancer-induced muscle wasting might also impinge on tumor-targeted therapies improving their effectiveness and/ or enhancing patient tolerance to chemotherapy. In addition, metabolic modulators could also directly affect tumor growth. This is the case, for example, of exercise, that was shown to prevent or at least delay tumor growth [112] .",
