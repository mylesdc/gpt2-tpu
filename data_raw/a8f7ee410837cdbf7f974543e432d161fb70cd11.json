            "text": "Human Enterovirus 71 (EV71) commonly causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in young children, and occasional occurrences of neurological complications can be fatal. In this study, a high-throughput cell-based screening on the serine/threonine kinase siRNA library was performed to identify potential antiviral agents against EV71 replication. Among the hits, Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) was selected for detailed analysis due to its strong inhibitory profile and novelty. In the investigation of the stage at which MINK is involved in EV71 replication, virus RNA transfection in MINK siRNA-treated cells continued to cause virus inhibition despite bypassing the normal entry pathway, suggesting its involvement at the post-entry stage. We have also shown that viral RNA and protein expression level was significantly reduced upon MINK silencing, suggesting its involvement in viral protein synthesis which feeds into viral RNA replication process. Through proteomic analysis and infection inhibition assay, we found that the activation of MINK was triggered by early replication events, instead of the binding and entry of the virus. Proteomic analysis on the activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was stimulated by EV71 infection upon MINK activation. Luciferase reporter assay further revealed that the translation efficiency of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was reduced after blocking the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway. Further investigation on the effect of MINK silencing on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) localisation demonstrated that cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 upon EV71 infection may be facilitated via the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway which then positively regulates the translation of viral RNA transcripts. These novel findings hence suggest that MINK plays a functional role in the IRES-mediated translation of EV71 viral RNA and may provide a potential target for the development of specific antiviral strategies against EV71 infection.",

In the recent years, outbreaks within the Asia-Pacific region have caused significant deaths, making EV71 a major public health risk. Despite the growing threat from the spread of EV71 and increased research in this area, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available against EV71. Cellular signalling and host kinases have been reported to play significant roles in the replication and propagation of many different pathogens. In this paper, we show that a serine/threonine kinase, Misshapen NIK-related kinase (MINK), plays a role in the replication of EV71 by stimulating the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway which in turns promotes the translation efficiency of EV71 viral protein synthesis. As the synthesis of viral proteins is crucial for the replication of the virus during infection, discovery of a crucial host kinase in this process may provide insights on the replication of EV71. With deeper understanding of the functions and regulation of MINK, this kinase may serve as a promising target for the development of antiviral therapy.

            "text": "EV71 is a small (33-35nm) , single-stranded, positive-sense, non-enveloped RNA virus with a viral genome of approximately 7.5kb. The virions consist of an icosahedral capsid of 60 protomers surrounding viral genomic RNA [10] that contains a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the 3' UTR. The ORF encodes four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4) that make up the viral capsid and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D) which are involved in viral replication. Viral 2A and 3C proteases are involved in the cleavage of the polyprotein precursor to release the mature viral proteins while viral protein 3D is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays a major role in the synthesis of negative-and positive-sense viral RNA [11] . Upon EV71 infection, the viral genome is translated into the viral polyprotein and the 3D protein participates in the transcription of the positive-sense genomic viral RNA into the complementary negative-sense viral RNA, which serves as a template for the synthesis of more positive-sense genomic viral RNA. The genomic RNA is then translated into more viral polyproteins in a cap-independent manner and the polyproteins are subsequently processed into the structural capsid proteins and non-structural proteins [11] . The 5' UTR of the EV71 genomic RNA contains a cloverleaf structure involved in viral RNA replication and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which directs viral protein translation in a cap-independent manner [12, 13] . The picornavirus IRES have been classified into three types based on its structure and enteroviruses (and rhinoviruses) have the type 1 IRES which requires certain eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and IRES-specific transacting factors (ITAFs) to initiate viral protein translation. In contrast to cellular capdependent translation, the host 40S ribosomal subunit is recruited at the IRES without the need for eIF4E to initiate viral polyprotein translation [14] . A number of ITAFs have been identified to interact with picornavirus IRES and mediate translation initiation of the viral polyprotein. These ITAFs include polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) [15, 16, 17] , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E (hnRNP E) [18] , far-upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1) and FBP2 [19] . Among these ITAFs, hnRNP A1 [20] ,and FBPs [19] have been reported to interact with EV71 IRES.",

            "text": "Given the small genome size of EV71, the virus depends on several cellular proteins and machineries in the host cell to complete its replication. In search for host cellular factors that play a role in EV71 replication, an understanding of the cellular proteins involved in different stages of viral replication would be useful for the identification of potential targets for the development of antiviral strategies. In this study, an immunofluorescence cell-based virus infection assay was set-up to screen the human serine/threonine kinase siRNA library using a set of validated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the host serine/threonine kinases. Several candidate kinases that showed significant inhibition of EV71 replication upon gene knockdown were identified and among the hits, Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK), a novel sterile 20 (Ste20) family kinase, was chosen for further evaluations. MINK, also known as MAP4K6, is a germinal center kinase (GCK) from the Ste20 family of kinases that includes more than 30 serine/threonine kinases with catalytic domains that are homologous to the yeast Ste20 kinases. MINK is structurally similar to the Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) which has previously been proposed to link the protein tyrosine kinase signals to the activation of c-Jun N-terminus kinases (JNK) pathway via the SH2-SH3 domain of Nck [21] . As a member of the GCK class of kinases, MINK has an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The intermediate domain consists of multiple proline rich motifs that are putative SRC homology 3 (SH3) binding sites [22] . The MINK1 gene encodes a polypeptide of 1312 amino acids and is expressed in most tissues in at least five alternatively spliced isoforms [22] . Studies on cells under environmental stress [23] revealed that MINK activates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathway, which are important signalling pathways involved in various cellular functions such as apoptosis, protein translation and cell differentiation [24] . Apart from cellular functions, p38 MAPK pathway has also been reported to play a role in the IRES-mediated viral protein translation of Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) viral RNA [25] .

The top three targets identified, PAK1, MINK and MAP4K2, were first analysed. PAK1 was observed to cause the highest level of virus inhibition but closer analysis led to the removal of this target from further downstream studies due in part to the large standard error in the results obtained and lower cell density observed in all the PAK1 replicate wells.

Western blotting was carried out to verify the gene knockdown efficiency. Dose-dependent reduction in the protein expression level of MINK was observed upon MINK siRNA treatment, suggesting that the range of siRNA concentration used in this study was effective in silencing the MINK gene ( Fig. 2C panel i and Fig. 2D ). This was further verified by the scrambled siRNA treatment, as Human serine/threonine kinase siRNA library screen. Effect of gene knockdown by siRNA on EV71 replication analysed from primary screen. 40% reduction in viral antigen positive cells was considered as the acceptable level of virus inhibition and positive hits are genes which resulted in a percentage of viral antigen positive cells of less than 60% upon the knockdown of these genes. As such, 6 genes have been identified as positive hits from the primary screen. First 6 bars represent siRNA controls used while the other bars represent the host serine/threonine kinases targeted in the screening. siRNA controls utilised included non-targeting siRNAs as well as siRNAs targeting several housekeeping genes. Values obtained in the graph were normalised against the mean of the transfection control (EV71-infected cells treated with only the transfection reagent). there was no reduction in MINK protein levels observed across the siRNA concentration range used in the study (Fig. 2C panel ii, and Fig. 2D ). To further validate the specificity of the MINK SMARTpool siRNAs, deconvolution assay was performed with 45nM concentrations of each specific individual siRNA of the SMARTpool (four specific siRNAs). This approach would help to ensure that inhibitory effects of the targeting siRNAs on EV71 infection observed in the secondary assay was specific and not due to off-target gene effects. Before a viral plaque assay was performed to determine the virus titre upon gene knockdown using the individual siRNAs within the SMARTpool, gene knockdown efficiency of each individual siRNAs was assessed. From the Western blot analysis, it was observed that all four individual siRNAs directed against MINK were effective in reducing MINK protein levels at a concentration of 45nM ( Fig. 2E and Fig. 2F ). Coinciding with the knockdown efficiency of individual siRNA, viral plaque assay results showed that all four individual siRNAs resulted in significant reduction in virus titre of at least 1.3 log at 45nM concentration (Fig. 2G) . Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the inhibition on EV71 propagation was a result of the targeted siRNA knockdown of MINK and thus, MINK is essential for the replication of EV71.",

The dose-dependent reduction in infectious virus titres upon the siRNA knockdown of MINK was reproduced with all three viruses as demonstrated in Fig. 2H . As shown in Fig. 2H , the knockdown of MINK resulted in the reduction of infectious virus titre by approximately 2.3 log units. 1.5 log unit and 1.5 log unit respectively for EV71 strain 41, Echovirus 7 and CA6 relative to the scrambled siRNA controls (Scr).

Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test (Graphpad software) against scrambled control (Scr). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.0001 (n = 3) versus scrambled control. MINK plays an essential role in EV71 viral protein synthesis. (A) EV71 viral RNA was transfected into RD cells pre-treated with MINK siRNA and supernatant was harvested from cells at 12h post-infection (hpi) for viral plaque assay. Silencing of MINK with targeting siRNA continued to cause inhibition of virus replication. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test (Graphpad software). *** P < 0.0001 (n = 3) versus untreated control (0nM). (B) EV71 RNA synthesis was sensitive to silencing efficiencies of MINK. Quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed significant reduction in levels of EV71 RNA across increasing siRNA concentration in MINK siRNA-treated cells. Total RNA was extracted for all samples at 0, 8 and 10hpi and EV71 RNA levels were measured. C T values were normalised against actin and relative quantification of viral RNA level was determined. The \u0394\u0394Ct data were calculated from three independent experiments and error bars represent standard deviation for triplicate data sets. Fold difference of viral RNA for all samples was calculated relative to the RNA level in the transfection control (PTC) at 0hpi. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test (Graphpad software). *P<0.05 and *** P < 0.0001 (n = 3) vs the respective PTC at each time-point. (C) Time course study of EV71 structural protein expression via Western blot analysis. Upper band (36kDa) represents VP0 while lower band (28 kDa) represents VP2. \u03b2-actin was used as the the virus release process upon the silencing of MINK, but was due to a decrease in the total production of virus particles.",

Since phospho-MINK antibodies are not available commercially, a phosphate-binding tag (Phos-Tag) [27] was used to separate the phosphorylated proteins from the unphosphorylated proteins. 6h and 8h were selected as the time-points for harvest of cell lysates due to the significant increase in phospho-MINK levels at these time-points after infection (S1 Fig). As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B , cells transfected with viral RNA displayed similar phospho-MINK levels at 6h and 8h as the infection control (EV71-infected), suggesting that initial binding and entry processes of the virus was not required for the activation of MINK upon EV71 infection.",

Viral plaque assay was first conducted to confirm the efficacy of the anti-SCARB2 antibody in blocking EV71 infection. A corresponding control IgG antibody that does not bind specifically to any proteins was used as a negative control. Results from the infection inhibition assay showed that pre-treatment of RD cells with the anti-SCARB2 antibody blocked EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner as the virus titre was significantly reduced by~1.5 log at the highest concentration of anti-SCARB2 antibody used (Fig. 4C ). On the other hand, treatment with the control IgG antibody did not affect the binding and entry of virus into the cells (Fig. 4C ) as the virus titres remained constant across increasing concentrations of IgG antibody.",

As such, virus binding was unlikely to be the triggering event of the phosphorylation of MINK.

It has been reported that MINK activates the p38 MAPK pathway [23] , a signalling pathway that has also been shown to play a role in the replication of Encephalomyelitis virus (EMCV), a member of the Picornaviridae family [25] . As such, we examined the activation profile of p38 MAPK upon EV71 infection to assess whether the p38 MAPK signalling pathway is activated during EV71 replication. As serum has also been reported to induce phosphorylation of certain proteins [29] , fecal calf serum (FCS) was removed from the virus stock and growth media in the course of this experiment to reduce the additional activation of p38 MAPK by the serum. Cell lysates were analysed at indicated time-points post-infection for 12h by Western blotting to examine the changes in the phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38). Constant and basal phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed in mock-infected cells throughout the 12h time course (Fig. 5B and 5D). In contrast, the EV71-infected cells showed an increase in the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK between 6 to 8h post-infection ( Fig. 5A and 5D ), followed by a subsequent decrease from 8 to 12h post-infection. To demonstrate the dependency of p38 MAPK phosphorylation on EV71 replication, we also examined the phospho-p38 MAPK profile in RD cells infected with UV-inactivated EV71 ( Fig. 5C and 5D ). Similar to the mock-infected control, cells exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 showed constant phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK throughout the 12h time course, indicating that attachment of the virions to cell surface receptors or virus entry process were not sufficient to trigger the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Total p38 MAPK was also assessed to ensure that the changes in phospho-p38 MAPK levels were not due to differences in p38 MAPK expression levels. Phospho-p38 MAPK levels at 0h post-infection appears higher in Fig. 5A in EV71-infected samples than that in the mockinfected samples (Fig. 5B ) and samples exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 (Fig. 5C ) probably due to more total proteins loaded as seen from the total p38 and \u03b2-actin levels. However, it is evident in the trend of p38 MAPK activation profile that phospho-p38 MAPK levels were significantly increased upon EV71 infection (Fig. 5D) . Hence, these results suggested that activation of p38 MAPK signalling pathway requires the active replication of EV71.",

In addition, cell viability of SB203580-treated cells was assessed to rule out the possibility of reduced viral growth due to cytotoxicity after treatment with SB203580. Our results from the alamarBlue cytotoxicity assay indicated that the concentration range of SB203580 used in this study did not lead to significant reductions in cell viability and hence, the dose-dependent reduction of EV71 virus titre by SB203580 was not complicated by its cytotoxic effects (Fig. 6C ). Together, these results indicated that blockage of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway can significantly reduce viral growth and hence, p38 MAPK pathway is essential for EV71 propagation.",

All cell culture supernatants were collected for viral plaque assay at 12h post-infection. From the results in Fig. 6D , pre-treatment of cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor for 2h prior to EV71 infection showed minimal inhibitory effect against viral infection. A significant reduction in EV71 titres was observed when SB203580 was added at 6h post-infection. At 10h post-infection, the antiviral activity of SB203580 was reduced. This suggested that the blocking of p38 MAPK signalling pathway inhibits EV71 replication during the early phase after viral entry, between 0h and 8h post-infection. A co-treatment assay was conducted to complement data from the pre-treatment assay to determine if SB203580 affected viral binding and entry into the cells. Co-treatment of EV71 with SB203580 failed to inhibit viral infection, further confirming the involvement of p38 MAPK signalling pathway in the post-entry stage in EV71 replication cycle.",

Comparison of the relative RNA level was made between the samples treated the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and the respective DMSO control at each time-point. Similar to what was observed for the siRNA knockdown of MINK (Fig. 3B) , there was increase in viral RNA level between time-points and viral RNA level in SB203580treated cells was significantly lower than that in the DMSO control at both 8h and 10h post-infection, with fold reductions of 12.4 and 9.0 at 8h and 10h post-infection at 100\u03bcM concentration, respectively (Fig. 6E) .

Significant reduction in the Fig. 6F and 6G ) and non-structural protein levels (3D protein, S2D and S2E Fig) were also observed with increasing concentrations of SB203580. The extent of the reduction in 3D protein level upon SB203580 treatment corresponded to the decrease in the viral RNA levels. Hence, we have shown that p38 MAPK signalling pathway is involved in the viral protein synthesis stage.",

Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is predominantly a nuclear protein but shuttles back and forth between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It has been reported that hnRNP A1 act as an ITAF that relocalises in the cytoplasm where it interacts with the EV71 IRES upon infection, promoting its translation efficiency [20] . As previous study has also shown that p38 MAPK signalling is implicated in the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 in uninfected cells [35] , we were interested to know whether MINK/p38 MAPK signalling modulate the EV71 IRES activity by altering the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1. Fig. 8A shows the immunofluorescence staining of hnRNP A1 in EV71-infected cells at 8h post-infection. The degree of colocalisation between the hnRNP A1 protein (stained with rhodamine) and the cell nucleus (stained with DAPI) was quantified using Manders RD cells were pre-treated with MINK or scrambled siRNA. Three days after transfection, the bicistronic construct was then transfected into the cells. Luciferase activity was measured 24h after transfection. Amantadine, an inhibitor of EV71 IRES [33] , was added to untreated cells to serve as negative control for IRES activity. Untreated cells that were transfected with the bicistronic construct were used as positive control. The FLuc/RLuc ratio for each sample were normalised to the FLuc/RLuc ratio of untreated control. Dose-dependent reduction in relative translation efficiency of the IRES was observed in MINK siRNA-treated cells. Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicate data sets. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test (Graphpad software). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and *** P < 0.0001 versus untreated control.

Relative translation efficiency was determined as the ratio of FLuc to RLuc for each sample and the FLuc/ RLuc ratio for each sample were normalised to the FLuc/RLuc ratio of coefficient [36] . The level of the hnRNP A1 in the nucleus increased significantly upon the siRNA-knockdown of MINK (74.8% colocalisation, Fig. 8A xiii-xvi) compared to the scrambled control (37.2% colocalisation, Fig. 8A ix-xii) , resembling the state of hnRNP A1 in mockinfected cells (80.1% colocalisation, Fig. 8A i-iv) . These data demonstrated that the silencing of MINK reduced the hnRNP A1 signals in the cytoplasm as the degree of colocalisation between the hnRNP A1 signals and DAPI signals in the nucleus increased upon the siRNA knockdown of MINK.",

Fig. 8B shows the immunofluorescence staining of hnRNP A1 in EV71-infected cells at 8h post-infection. The level of the hnRNP A1 in the nucleus increased significantly upon SB203580 treatment at 50\u03bcM (81.3% colocalisation, Fig. 8B ix-xii) compared to the DMSO control (52.9% colocalisation, Fig. 8B v-viii). In addition, the level of hnRNP A1 in the nucleus was even higher in cells treated with 100\u03bcM of SB203580 (92% colocalisation, Fig. 8B xiii-xvi), resembling the state of hnRNP A1 in mock-infected cells (94.5% colocalisation, Fig. 8B i-iv). These data demonstrated that the inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced the hnRNP A1 signals in the cytoplasm as the degree of colocalisation between the hnRNP A1 signals and DAPI signals in the nucleus increased upon SB203580 treatment. Together, we have shown in our study that it is likely that hnRNP A1 was one of the targets downstream of MINK/p38 MAPK signalling which is involved in promoting the translation efficiency of EV71 IRES as the relocalisation of hnRNP A1 to the cytoplasm where it binds to the IRES of EV71 RNA is required to facilitate translation initiation of viral RNA.",

To determine if Mnk1 phosphorylation was triggered by the replication of the virus, RD cells were exposed to UV-inactivated EV71. Cells exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 showed constant phosphorylation level of Mnk1 throughout the 12h time course (S4A and S4B Fig) . This indicated that attachment of the virions to cell surface receptors or virus entry process was not sufficient to trigger the phosphorylation of Mnk1, which corresponded to what was observed previously for the activation of MINK and p38 MAPK upon EV71 infection ( Fig. 4 and 5) .",

Activation profiles of MINK and entry assays have revealed that virus attachment and clathrin-mediated entry was not sufficient in triggering the activation of MINK. Instead, active replication of the virus and the accumulation of viral RNA or proteins might be potential inducers of MINK phosphorylation.

            "text": "Investigation into the stage of involvement of MINK in EV71 replication has also revealed interesting findings on the functional role of MINK in the propagation of EV71. Prior to our work, MINK has been suggested to play a role in the reorganisation of cytoskeleton such as actin filaments [22] which have been implicated in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles in endocytosis pathways [45, 46] . Since EV71 is known to enter RD cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [26] , we first hypothesised that actin rearrangement induced by the activation of MINK may play a role during the clathrin-mediated entry of EV71. However, results from the viral entry study via viral RNA transfection were contrary to this hypothesis as silencing of MINK continued to cause inhibition of progeny virus production despite bypassing the normal entry pathway. Results from the real time RT-PCR analysis have also indicated that the silencing of MINK has an effect on the viral RNA levels. During EV71 replication, protein translation of the viral genomic RNA has to precede viral RNA replication as the production of non-structural proteins such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Protein 3D) is essential for the synthesis of viral RNA. As such, synthesis of viral proteins was also investigated upon the silencing of MINK, structural viral protein (VP0 and VP2) and non-structural protein (3D) levels was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with increasing MINK siRNA concentrations. However, since VP0 and VP2 are both products of proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein, there is a possibility that the siRNA knockdown of MINK affected the proteolytic cleavage efficiency which led to the reduction in VP0 and VP2 levels. The VP2 antibody (MAB979) used in this study recognizes a specific epitope on the VP2 protein [47] , hence, larger incomplete processed viral polyproteins containing the VP2 epitope can also be detected. In this study, we have demonstrated that the protein levels of larger incomplete processed viral polyproteins (sizes coincided to that of P1 and VP4+VP3+VP2) [48] also showed similar trend to that of VP0 and VP2 protein levels where a dose-dependent reduction in the incomplete processed viral polyproteins levels was observed with the siRNA knockdown of MINK but not in the scrambled control. This narrowed down the potential target event of MINK involvement in the process of viral protein synthesis and not the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein. In addition, siRNA knockdown of MINK did not lead to an accumulation of intracellular virus, but instead, resulted in a global decrease in both extracellular and intracellular virus titres. This demonstrated that the silencing of MINK suppressed the production of progeny virus and not virus release.",

As shown previously by Hirasawa and his colleagues (2003), p38 MAPK signalling pathway promotes viral protein synthesis but not viral RNA synthesis in EMCV, which also belongs to the same family as EV71. Their study has demonstrated that p38 MAPK signalling pathway facilitates EMCV protein synthesis by promoting the translation efficiency of the IRES in EMCV. Supporting this hypothesis, our study has demonstrated the crucial role of p38 MAPK in the propagation of EV71 and that the activation of the MINK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway promotes the translation efficiency of EV71 IRES during EV71 replication. Time-of-addition assay conducted in our study verified that p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, was effective in inhibiting the early events of EV71 replication cycle post-infection and not late events such as virus release. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signalling also demonstrated an inhibition in the synthesis of EV71 viral proteins (3D, VP0 and VP2) and viral RNA replication which were in agreement with the results observed upon the silencing of MINK. Contrary to what was observed with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) [31] , the inhibition of p38 MAPK did not block the release of the virus. Hence, this further supported the relationship between MINK and p38 MAPK signalling and the involvement of MINK/p38 MAPK in EV71 protein synthesis which resulted in a global decrease in the progeny virus production.",

Previous study on a poliovirus/rhinovirus chimera (PSRIPO) [34] has shown that signal transduction to Mnk1, a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK can favour viral, cap-independent translation via eIF4E phosphorylation and expression. Contrary to this finding, our data showed a down-regulation in the protein expression of eIF4E which led to a consequent reduction in its phosphorylation levels, suggesting that eIF4E phosphorylation and expression may not be crucial for EV71 replication. This finding was supported by another study [53] that has demonstrated that induction of miRNA-141 during EV71 infection down-regulated eIF4E in an attempt to suppress cap-dependent translation and promote the switch to cap-independent translation.",

            "text": "Apart from factor eIF4E, other canonical translation factor such as eIF2\u03b1 has also been reported to play a role in Picornavirus replication [54] . Factor eIF2\u03b1 is a 36kDa protein that contains a serine residue (Ser-51) which can be phosphorylated under nutrient deprivation or cellular stresses such as virus infection or heat-shock. GCN2, PKR, PERK and HRI have been shown to phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in response to amino acid starvation, double-stranded RNA, protein misfolding at the endoplasmic reticulum and the absence of HEME, respectively [55] . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits the GDP-GTP recycling catalysed by eIF2B, hindering the generation of the ternary complex Met-tRNAi-eiF2-GTP and binding of this complex to the 40S ribosome to initiate translation [56] . Although eIF2\u03b1 is required for both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated protein translation, studies have shown that some viral IRES elements can translate independent of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [57, 58] . Consistent with studies on enteroviruses [32] , we observed an increasing level of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 at late times post-infection (S3A and S3B Fig). Published studies on poliovirus have also demonstrated that resistance to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation increases as enteroviral infection progresses due to the cleavage of initiation factor eIF5B by the viral 3C protease. As such, the induction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at the late time-points of EV71 infection may also serve to promote the viral protein synthesis indirectly by suppressing cellular cap-dependent protein synthesis [59] . Although p38 MAPK signalling has not been implicated in the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and significant reduction in cap-dependent protein translation was not observed in our luciferase data, we have conducted brief experiments to investigate the relationship between MINK expression and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (S3C and S3D Fig) . From the suppression of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation upon the silencing of MINK, it is tempting to speculate that the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 may be a minor side effect of the activation of MINK that serve to promote EV71 protein synthesis. Future downstream studies have to be performed to elucidate the role and involvement of eIF2\u03b1 in EV71 replication in relation to MINK. Nonetheless, our findings on these canonical translation initiation factors suggested that the increased EV71 IRES translation efficiency observed in our study might have resulted from the activation of ITAFs downstream of MINK/ p38 MAPK signalling instead of the phosphorylation status of the eIFs.",

            "text": "Members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) classes have been identified as trans-acting factors that control translation initiation of various cellular and viral mRNAs at the IRES [60] . Among the hnRNP family, hnRNP A1 has been reported to modulate the IRES-mediated viral protein translation of various viruses such as the human rhinovirus (HRV) [61] and EV71 [20] . Although, hnRNP A1 localises predominantly in the nucleus, it is able to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a regulated manner [62] . Infection of cells with HRV and EV71 has shown to result in the cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 where it interacts directly with the viral IRES sequences [20] . Apart from picornaviruses, cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 has also been reported to play a role in the positive regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [63] and Sindbis virus (SINV) [20] viral RNA translation. In uninfected cells, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway upon osmotic shock or UV irradiation has been revealed to result in a phosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 [35] . Furthermore, a separate study has also demonstrated that the p38 MAPK interacts and regulates the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1 in a Mnk1-dependent manner in senescent cells [37] . The cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 after EV71 infection may therefore also be dependent on the p38 MAPK pathway and its downstream substrate Mnk1 as in uninfected cells. In our study, subcellular localisation studies unravelled the relationship between MINK protein expression and hnRNP A1 localisation in the cells. Interestingly, we have found that the silencing of MINK upon EV71 infection did not result in the cytoplasmic accummulation of hnRNP A1 which was usually observed in infected cells. The nuclear retention of hnRNP A1 could be due to either lower levels of EV71 replication as a result of MINK silencing or a block in nuclear export signal [64] brought about by the siRNA knockdown of MINK. Similarly, the inhibition of p38 MAPK with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) also resulted in the accumulation of hnRNP A1 signals in the nucleus. Although we have demonstrated that inhibition of the MINK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway reduced the hnRNP A1 signals in the cytoplasm that was observed in control EV71-infected cells, we have no direct evidence suggesting that MINK plays a direct role on the cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 where it binds directly to the IRES sequences of the viral genome to promote the IRES-mediated translation of the EV71 viral RNA. In addition, we have also shown that despite its activation during EV71, p38 MAPK substrate Mnk1 was not involved in the regulation of EV71 protein synthesis and the cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1. Hence, the exact mechanism of how MINK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway affected the cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 during EV71 infection and the p38 MAPK substrates involved needs to be further established. Nonetheless, we have shown in this study that a novel host kinase (MINK) mediates the cap-independent translation of EV71 RNA, possibly by modulating the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1, which further supports its propagation (Fig. 9 ). As such, MINK can be further explored as potential antiviral target for the inhibition of EV71 viral replication at the viral protein translation stage.",
