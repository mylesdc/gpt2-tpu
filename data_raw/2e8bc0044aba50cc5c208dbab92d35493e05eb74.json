Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. Methods: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection.",

H9N2 viruses have been isolated from pigs and humans with influenza-like illness in Hong Kong and Mainland China [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , demonstrating that the H9N2 influenza virus could cross species barriers and expand its host range from birds to mammalians. Recently, a research showed that H9N2 viruses and pandemic H1N1 viruses have high genetic compatibility and they can produce higher pathogenic reassortment in experimental condition [10] . In addition, H9N2 viruses provide their six inner genes to contribute to the evolution of the H7N9, H10N8 and H5N6 viruses that cause severe human respiratory infections in China [11] [12] [13] . All these features indicate that H9N2 virus has a considerable public health threat. Thus, it is valuable to reveal the pathogenesis of H9N2 influenza virus infection and the innate immune responses of host to the H9N2 viruses.",

            "text": "Pathogen invasion could be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and results in production of interferon [14] . The type I interferon binds to interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors and activates JAK-STAT signaling pathway, resulting in the expression of hundreds of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) [15] . Products of these genes are mostly antiviral proteins which are essential for mediating the antiviral state of the host. Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) were identified nearly 30 years ago, and although other functions have been proposed, the primary role of IFITM proteins seems to be antiviral. IFITM proteins are a family of small transmembrane proteins that are induced strongly by interferon, but that are also expressed basally in several cell types and lines [16, 17] . To date, three IFITM proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have been identified to display broad spectrum antiviral activity in human and mice [18, 19] . Especially, the IFITM1 and IFITM3 were proven to be more effective in resisting influenza virus infection [20, 21] . The siRNA-mediated depletion of IFITMs significantly increased H1N1 virus titers in primary lung fibroblasts and in HeLa cells, while overexpression of IFITM1, 2, 3 could improve resistance to the H3N2 influenza in A549 and MDCK cell lines [22] . Although the antiviral activity of IFITMs has been identified in multiple types of cells, the antiviral activity of IFITM1 has not been reported in endothelial cells infected with H9N2 virus or inoculated with inactivated viral particle.",

But the more and more evidences indicated that endothelial cells might play an important role in response to influenza virus infection. Most endothelial cells are also showed to express two kinds of influenza virus receptors which provide potential possibility for influenza virus infection in endothelial cells [26] . H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses have been proven to directly infect human lung microvascular endothelial cells and replicate in endothelial cell lines [27, 28] . Several studies indicated that endothelial cells might be the source of the cytokines and involved in lung injury during influenza virus infection [29] [30] [31] [32] . So, it is important to understand the cellular responses in endothelial cell during influenza virus infection. Our previous study revealed that H9N2 virus could infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and induce high level expression of several ISGs, especially IFITM1 [33] . The microarray results showed that both H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increase the expression of IFITM1 at transcription level, and the viral particle inoculation induces a higher level (44.75 folds) of IFITM1 than that (8.53 folds) induced by virus infection. However, the level of IFITM1 needs to be quantified by Real-Time PCR and western blot, and little is known about the antiviral activity of IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus and viral particle in HUVECs. The present study aimed to quantify the expression of IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus and viral particle and investigate the antiviral state mediated by IFITM1 in HUVECs. And the results showed that both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation significantly increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels, and the IFITM1 protein induced by viral particle inoculation significantly enhanced the antiviral state of HUVECs against H9N2 virus infection.",

            "text": "The expression of ISGs is an early response of host to virus infection, and their products confers host the antiviral state which inhibits the entry process or replication of invading virus. To date, multiple proteins translated by ISGs have been validated as antiviral proteins, such as protein kinase R (PKR), myxovirus-resistance proteins, ISG15, Schlafen 11 and so on. IFITM proteins are recently identified antiviral factors that play critical roles in the intrinsic and interferon-mediated control of virus infection [20, 22] . Since initially identified by a siRNA screen for factors that restrict influenza virus replication, more and more researches revealed the inhibition effect of IFITMs on enveloped viruses through affecting the interaction between virus envelope proteins and endosomal or lysosomal [43] . Recently, a study demonstrated that depletion of IFITM1 with siRNA increased titers of H1N1 virus in primary lung fibroblast cells and in HeLa cell line, overexpression of IFITM1 resisted H3N2 virus infection in A549 and MDCK cell lines [22] . In this study, our results showed that overexpression of IFITM1 significantly reduced the virus titers in HUVECs and BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 8) . The present data reaffirmed the restriction effect of IFITM1 on influenza virus infection. To investigate whether IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation mediated the antiviral response in HUVECs, we detected the virus titers in HUVECs transfected with IFITM1 specific siRNA or control siRNA. The results showed that IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus infection could not enhanced the antiviral state in HUVECs.

Virus titer of each group was detected by plaque assay at 36 h postinfection.

Taking into account the above results, we hypothesized that virus replication preceded the expression of IFITM1 in initially infected cells. A previous study demonstrated that IFITM3 efficiently restricted influenza virus and IFITM1 modestly restricted influenza virus, and the expression patterns of IFITMs are likely to be an independent determinant of viral tropism [20] . Our previous microarray results showed that H9N2 virus and viral particle do not induce the expression of IFITM3 in HUVECs [33] . We speculated that this might be a unique response of HUVECs to H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation. Taken together, our data may offer further insight into the innate immune response of endothelial cells to influenza virus infection.",

The observation differed to what we generally expected, so it is worthy of thinking the sense of IFITM1 expression upregulated by viral particle. Moreover, a recent study indicated that H9N2 influenza virus infection induces the expression of IFITM1 in lung, heart and liver in BALB/c mice [44] . In vivo, the basal lamina with an average thickness of 1 \u03bcm is the only structure which separates epithelial cells and endothelial cells [45] . Death of infected epithelial cells creates gaps and the released virus particles readily access to endothelial cells [46, 47] . Thus, the released virus particles may stimulate the antiviral response in endothelial cells. In addition, cytokines produced by epithelial cells could further activate neighboring endothelial cells during influenza virus infection [48] . So it is conceivable that interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 released by infected epithelial cells could readily induce the expression of IFITM proteins in endothelial cells. Taken together, we may consider to enhance the antiviral state of host by stimulating the respiratory tract with inactivated viral particles.",

However, our results showed that expression of IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus and viral particle independently of interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 in HUVECs (Fig. 2) . Although a recent study demonstrated that human IFITM3 and mouse IFITM3 are induced by cytokines of the gp130 family (such as IL-6) [50] , we failed to find a possible mechanism involved in IFITM1 expression. Thus, we investigated the effects of HA and NA proteins on the expression of IFITM1 in HUVECs. The results showed that treatment with HA or NA could not upregulate the levels of interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFITM1 (Figs. 3, 4) . Virus RNA activates the cellular antiviral response has been widely reported. In the present study, we did not investigate the effect of RNA of H9N2 virus on the antiviral response in endothelial cells. However, our results showed that H9N2 virus could infect and replicate in HUVECs with invalid effect on antiviral response of HUVECs. The results indicated that RNA of H9N2 virus may play an insignificant role in the expression of IFITM1 induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation. We speculated that the induction of IFITM1 expression may depend on the interaction between viral particles and cellular factors. Moreover, a previous study demonstrated that interactions between cellular factors and envelope glycoprotein B of replication defective human cytomegalovirus may induce ISGs expression [51] . Then we verified whether the viral particles were taken up by cells using immunofluorescence. The results showed that viral particles could enter the HUVECs (Fig. 5) , suggesting that cellular interaction might be involved in the induction of IFITM1 in HUVECs. Obviously, more work needs to be done to explore this induction mechanism, and data of the present study might considerably narrow the range of possible mechanisms.",

To investigate whether these phenomena were unique responses to H9N2 virus and viral particle in HUVECs, we performed the same experiments on epithelial cells synchronously. Our results showed that endothelial cells and epithelial cells shared different features. Consistent with a previous study [52] , H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation elevated the levels of type I interferon in BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 2 ). In addition, contrary to endothelial cells, H9N2 virus infection induced a higher level of IFITM1 in BEAS-2Bs (Fig. 1) .
