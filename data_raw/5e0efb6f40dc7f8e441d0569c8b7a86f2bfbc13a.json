Antibiotic In temperate countries, predictable winter epidemics occur, but transmission dynamics in tropical settings are more irregular. For many decades, influenza was thought not to be a disease of importance in tropical countries. This has changed considerably in the last 10 years. 3 Research efforts are ongoing to increase knowledge and understanding of how tropical transmission influences global influenza transmission. Vietnam, as one of the most populous countries in the tropics, is a potentially globally important site for influenza dynamics, both for its possible contribution to global virus evolution 4,5 and as a high-risk environment for the emergence of potentially pandemic strains such as highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1.",

As national surveillance programmes 6, 7 have focused largely on hospital sites, estimates from these studies are likely to underestimate true clinical burden and attack rates in the community. Seasonal influenza vaccine is not currently provided through public health services in Vietnam and there is minimal, although increasing, use in the private sector. 13 The optimal vaccination strategy for seasonal influenza in Vietnam is still to be established. 14 The objectives of this study were to describe the dynamics and demographic/clinical characteristics of ILI presenting to primary care services within an urban setting in Vietnam over a 27-month period and to estimate the proportion of ILI caused by influenza A and influenza B.",

This was consistent with previous national hospital-based surveillance which demonstrated asynchronous peaks and co-circulation of different strains. 6, 8 Our surveillance results were also consistent with data showing that the northern subtropical regions of Vietnam have a more predictable seasonality than the tropical central and southern regions. 23 Heterogeneity in transmission patterns within tropical region is increasingly being recognised. 24 Vietnam has one the longest and lowest \"peaks\" when considered nationally, and the results of this study suggest that much of this is driven by the transmission dynamics in the south of the country. This study reports higher rates of influenza positivity in ILI than are generally described globally and fewer periods where no influenza was detected. [24] [25] [26] Attack rates measured through clinical settings are vulnerable to differences in healthcare seeking behaviour. 27 Primary care surveillance relies heavily on syndromic presentations. The ability of current ILI definitions to discriminate between influenza and non-influenza causes of upper respiratory tract infection in tropical settings has previously been called into question. 37 The clinics in this study also participated in a trial of mobile phone reporting of ILI which demonstrated that ILI symptoms are much more consistent through the year compared to temperate countries and that peaks in ILI activity do not always correlate with peaks in influenza activity. 11 The results of our study demonstrated that although fever, cough and rhinorrhoea were reported more commonly in those who had influenza, such symptoms also occurred in more than 70% of patients with non-influenza ILI confirming their poor discriminating ability.",

Molecular testing for influenza A and influenza B and 12 other respiratory viruses was performed.

All clinics had limited recruitment over the weekend period. These restrictions are likely to have impacted on the patient group which was recruited.The heterogeneity in subject demographics is important to consider when interpreting healthcare surveillance figures. In systems where patients have a relative choice regarding healthcare providers (rather than single providers like the NHS in the UK), it is important to consider alternative sources of surveillance.31,36",

However, only a single individual who reported having received vaccination had a recommended indication. The increase in vaccination rates detected through this study confirms the importance of defining the appropriate vaccination strategy for tropical Vietnam.38 Antibiotic use prior to enrolment was high in all groups. Antibiotics can easily be purchased in pharmacies across Vietnam without prescription.39 Most ILI have a viral aetiology and given the short time before presentation in this study, it is unlikely that individuals have developed a secondary bacterial infection; ILI may be a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use in this setting. Antibiotic resistance in Vietnam is an issue, as it is globally, education of medical professionals, pharmacists and the public about the appropriate use of antibiotics is urgently required. 40 A number of limitations are present in the study design. By recruiting individuals who attended for clinical review, we will have missed those with subclinical disease. At the other end of the clinical spectrum, individuals with severe disease have been excluded. By recruiting from a variety of clinics, we attempted to recruit a representative sample of the HCMC population. Improving and broadening surveillance from hospital to the community in tropical settings is important for understanding the global spread and evolution of the virus. Mild respiratory disease is normally thought of as a single syndromic entity. Our study shows that this is an over-simplification and that understanding the interactions between the different influenza types and subtypes, and other viral respiratory infections is critical if we are to improve prevention and management strategies for influenza and influenza-like illness. Influenza in southern Vietnam has complex transmission dynamics including periods of intense influenza activity of alternating types and subtypes. Broadening surveillance from hospital to the community in tropical settings is feasible and valuable for improving our understanding of the global spread and evolution of the virus.
