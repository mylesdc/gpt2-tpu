While the role of T FH -cells has been studied in blood and lymph nodes of HIV-1 infected individuals, its role in the mucosal tissues has not been investigated. We show that the gut and female reproductive tract (FRT) of humanized DRAG mice have a high level of human lymphocytes and a high frequency of T FH (CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ ) and precursor-T FH (CXCR5 + PD-1 + ) cells. The majority of T FH -cells expressed CCR5 and CXCR3 and are the most permissive to HIV-1 infection. A single low-dose intravaginal HIV-1 challenge of humanized DRAG mice results in 100% infectivity with accumulation of T FH -cells mainly in the Peyer's patches and FRT. The novel finding of T FH -cells in the FRT may contribute to the high susceptibility of DRAG mice to HIV-1 infection. This mouse model thus provides new opportunities to study T FH -cells and to evaluate HIV-1 vaccines.",

T FH cells reside within the follicles of secondary lymphoid tissue and are characterized by the expression of CXCR5, ICOS, and PD-1 as well as the transcription factor B cell lymphoma-6 (BCL-6) 1,2 . In the germinal centers (GC), T FH cells undergo a tight interaction with B cells and provide important signals for the induction and affinity maturation of antibody responses through the ligation with co-receptors such as ICOS, SLAM, and CD40L as well as cytokines including the signature T FH cell cytokine IL-21 [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, T FH cells have been shown to be critically involved in immunoglobulin class switch recombination and maturation of B cell responses into memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Previous studies have demonstrated that T FH cells are susceptible to HIV and SIV infection, expand during chronic infection, and can serve as a reservoir for latent HIV infection 9, 10 . Despite the predominant location of T FH cells within lymphoid follicles, many studies of human T FH cells have characterized cells in the peripheral blood 3,10-14 . Therefore, understanding the function and regulation of T FH cells within lymphoid tissues, and the interaction between T FH and B cells during chronic HIV infection, could be helpful in improving vaccine development strategies.",

Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the expression of CXCR3, PD-1, CCR5, and the permissiveness to HIV-1 infection.

To assess the level of reconstitution of human cells in DRAG mice, we harvested the gut (PP, IEL, LPL), FRT, LN, and SP. The presence of PP in DRAG mice, in contrast to other humanized mice, allowed us to characterize the lymphocytes in this tissue. Human cells were identified by the expression of human hematopoietic cell marker CD45 ( Fig. 1a left panel, representative dot plot). All lymphoid and mucosal tissues investigated were reconstituted with human cells (Fig. 1a left panel, Fig. 1b , average percentage with standard error of mean from 5-8 separate experiments, and Supplementary Fig. 1a , representative dot plot). Furthermore, the reconstitution of human cells in the gut of DRAG mice was high, compared to other humanized mouse strains 23 . The frequency of T cells was 60-85% of the human CD45 + cells (Fig. 1c) , while B cells constituted 10-35% of human CD45 + cells ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). There were no significant differences in the frequency of CD4 + T cells among the various tissues investigated (Fig. 1e) . Among T cells, the percentage of CD4 + T cells was much higher than CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1a second panel and Fig. 1e ), which is similar to what has been observed in humans. A subpopulation of T cells that expresses both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (CD4 + CD8 + or double positive) were mainly present in LPL (about 20%) and IEL (15.8%), and also in the PP (7%), SP (6%), FRT (5.3%), and LN (6%), albeit at a lower frequency ( Fig. 1a second panel, Fig. 1e , and Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The frequency of CD4 + CD8 + T cells in LPL and IEL was significantly higher compared to SP and LN (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively).",

However, the distribution of T FH cells in the gut and FRT has not been investigated. Analysis of single cell suspensions from mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), IEL, LPL, and PP of humanized DRAG mice revealed CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T FH cells (Fig. 3a) . T FH cells were largely present in the mLN (8.4%), and PP (7%), and at lower frequencies in IEL (0.8%), LPL (2.1%) Human B cell subsets in lymphoid tissue, gut, and FRT. A substantial advantage of humanized DRAG mice is the reconstitution of functional human B cells with the ability to perform class switch recombination and elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies upon vaccination 21 . As this model may be suitable for testing future vaccines, we investigated the distribution of B cell subsets in various tissues. In our study, we found that the largest population of B cells had a naive phenotype (CD38 \u2212 IgD + ) in all tissues examined except in LPL (Fig. 3b) . A substantial population of B cells in all of the tissues was in the early (CD38 + IgD \u2212 ) and late (CD38 \u2212 IgD \u2212 ) memory phase, while a small subset of B cells had a GC phenotype (CD38 ++ IgD \u2212 ) (Fig. 3b ).",

While the majority of CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ (red histogram) and CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 ++ (green histogram) CD4 + T cells expressed ICOS, a small proportion of CXCR5 + PD-1 + cells (orange histogram) also displayed this receptor on their surface (Fig. 4b ). BCL-6 is a transcription factor required for the differentiation of T FH cells 4 . We found that CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells also expressed high levels of BCL-6 with CXCR5 + PD-1 + CD4 + T cells expressing intermediate levels of BCL-6 ( Fig. 4c ). These results ) and (c) Flow cytometry histograms from a representative experiment (n = 2) from LPL show ICOS (b) and BCL-6 expression (c) on CD4 + T cells. Cells were gated for hCD45 and Aqua LIVE/DEAD. Cells were then gated for CD3 and CD4. CD4 + T cells were gated for PD-1 and CXCR5 then for ICOS (b) and BCL-6 (c). (d) A representative dot plot from two independent experiments shows the cytokine production by T FH cells from FRT and LPL. Cells were stained for hCD45, Aqua LIVE/DEAD, CD3, CD19, CD8, IgD, CD38, and then sorted for CD4 + T cells and B cells. In a second sort, CD4 + T cells were stained for PD-1 and CXCR5 to sort for CXCR5 + PD-1 + and CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells. B cells were sorted for memory cells expressing CD38 + IgD \u2212 cells. CXCR5 + PD-1 + and CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells were cultured with autologous memory B cells obtained from the same tissue. A schematic diagram of the sorting is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 . Stimulated FRT and LPL CD4 + T cells were stained for intracellular IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3 . (e) Endo-and ectocervix of human FRT were extracted from the muscular tissues and were digested with collagenase. The gating strategy is shown. Cells were gated for hCD45 and for Agua LIVE/DEAD followed by CD3 and CD4. CD4 + T cells were gated for PD-1 and CXCR5. CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cells were unstained (left panel) or stained for CXCR3 and BCL-6 (right panel). A representative dot plot from two independent human cervical tissues is shown. indicate that the CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells are T FH cells while the CXCR5 + PD-1 + CD4 + T cells are likely to be precursor T FH (pre-T FH ) cells.",

To investigate the ability of T FH cells to activate memory B cells, we sorted CXCR5 + PD-1 + and CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells from FRT and LPL of humanized DRAG mice. In parallel, we sorted autologous memory B cells from the same tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and incubated them with sorted CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ or CXCR5 + PD-1 + CD4 + T cells. After stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, cells were stained for CXCR3 and for intracellular IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4d) . Our data show that in both FRT and LPL, IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3 were mainly expressed by CXCR3 + CD4 + T cells, which were either CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ or CXCR5 + PD-1 + . However, the proportion of intracellular IL-21 + cells was low in PD-1 ++ CXCR3 \u2212 and PD-1 + CXCR3 \u2212 CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4d) . The presence of T FH cells in the FRT of humanized DRAG mice was unexpected, therefore, to confirm the presence of T FH cells in human FRT, we obtained cervical tissue from routine hysterectomy and extracted the endocervix and ectocervix. The ecto-and endocervix were treated with collagenase to obtain the cellular fractions and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The endo-and ectocervix contained approximately 1-3% CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4e) . The majority of these cells (about 72%) expressed BCL-6 confirming the presence of human T FH cells (Fig. 4e) , and then cultured for 48 hours as described in the Materials and Methods Section. Cells were stained for CD3, intracellular p24, for intracellular and extracellular CD4, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5a) . Cells from the gut mucosal tissues and FRT were infected with HIV-1 to varying degrees. CD4 + T cells from LPL were the most permissive (63%) to infection (Fig. 5a) . The proportion of CD4 + CD8 + T cells from LPL that were infected with HIV-1 was higher than CD4 + T cells (geometric mean fluorescent intensity = 689 vs. 530 respectively) obtained from the same tissue (Fig. 5b) . The productivity of HIV-1 infection was confirmed by analyzing the culture supernatants for p24. Approximately 94-250 ng ml \u22121 of p24 was detected in the culture supernatants of HIV-1 infected FRT and gut cells (data not shown).",

To test the in vitro HIV-1 infectivity of CD4 + T cell subsets in IEL, LPL, and PP, cells were stimulated, either uninfected or infected with HIV-1, and then cultured. After culture, cells were stained and analyzed as mentioned above. Uninfected LPL are shown in Fig. 6a first row. CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells were the most susceptible to HIV-1 infection (81%) compared to other subsets (Fig. 6a, second row, far right panel) . Other CD4 + T cell subsets, CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 + , CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 ++ , CXCR5 + PD-1 \u2212 , and CXCR5 + PD-1 + cells were also infected albeit at a lower frequency (36-55%) (Fig. 6a, second row) . The CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 \u2212 CD4 + T cells appeared to be more resistant to infection (Fig. 6a, second row, far left panel) . The fraction of cells expressing CXCR3 was the largest among CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T cells (Fig. 6a, third row, far right panel) , and intermediate among the other subsets, except for CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 \u2212 cells, which displayed low expression of this receptor on the surface (Fig. 6a third row far left panel) . The expression of CCR5 was high in the gut and FRT CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Among CD4 + T cell subsets, CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ and CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 ++ cells predominantly expressed CCR5 (65-76%), while CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 + , CXCR5 + PD-1 \u2212 and CXCR5 + PD-1 + cells were intermediate for CCR5 expression (Fig. 6a fourth row) . CCR5 receptor was detectable on a small subset (4%) of CXCR5 \u2212 PD-1 \u2212 CD4 + T cells. We also found a strong correlation between CCR5 and CXCR3 expression ( Figure 4) . The sorted hCD45 + CD4 + CXCR5-PD \u2212 1 \u2212 cells were then infected in duplicate with primary HIV-1 as described in the Methods Section, washed, and then cultured for three days. We found that 7% (Supplementary Figure 4B , upper panel) and 10% (Supplementary Figure 4B , lower panel) of the cells were infected and remained negative for PD-1 expression. Based on these data, we conclude that HIV-1 infection does not upregulate the expression of PD-1 in the first 3 days of infection.",

The percentage of CXCR5 + PD1 ++ CD4 + T cells expressing BCL-6 was highest in PP (96%) and LPL (96%) followed by FRT (68%) and IEL (62%) (Fig. 7e) . Among this population, the frequency of T FH cells that expressed CXCR3 varied from 30% to 71% (Fig. 7e) .",

            "text": "B cell subsets were largely diminished in the gut tissues of humanized DRAG mice at 75 days post infection, (Fig. 7g) . The highest frequency of naive B cells was seen in FRT, IEL, and LPL (43-65%), while it was lower in PP (11%). GC B cells were largely present in LPL (14%) and PP (29%) but at a reduced level in the FRT (7%), and rarely found in the IEL (1%) (Fig. 7g) . A higher frequency of early memory B cells was found in PP (40%), FRT (27%), and LPL (26%). In contrast, the frequency of late memory B cells was greatly diminished in PP, LPL, IEL, and FRT. facilitates HIV-1 infection of mucosal CD4 + T cells 27, 28, 37 . Our study demonstrates a high frequency of \u03b1 4\u03b2 7 + and CCR5 + CD4 + T cell memory phenotype in LPL, IEL, and FRT, which likely increased their susceptibility to HIV-1. Furthermore, the expression of \u03b1 4\u03b2 7 and CCR5 was not restricted to CD4 + T cells but was also seen at much higher levels on CD4 + CD8 + T cells, which has not been previously reported. The high expression of CCR5 and \u03b1 4\u03b2 7 on IEL and LPL CD4 + CD8 + T cells compared to CD4 + T cells, suggests that the CD4 + CD8 + T cells are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection. In fact, our study shows that acquisition of HIV-1 by CD4 + CD8 + T cells was greater than CD4 + (single positive) T cells obtained from the same tissue. Since the distribution and the frequency of memory phenotype were similar in CD4 + T cells and CD4 + CD8 + T cells, this indicates that in addition to their memory phenotype, the high expression of HIV-1 coreceptors also plays a crucial role in HIV-1 acquisition. It has been shown that CD4 + CD8 + T cells are highly susceptible to SIV in the gut 38 and HIV in the periphery 39 . It has been demonstrated that CD4 + CD8 + T cells are higher in the gut of healthy individuals and animals than in lymphoid organs [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] indicating that our findings in the gut of humanized DRAG mice are consistent with published data in humans. We are currently investigating the function of CD4 + CD8 + T cells in relation to HIV-1 infection. During the early stages of HIV-1 infection, T FH cells are functional and provide adequate B cell help. However in the chronic phase, although T FH cells have increased in number, their support for B cells is largely diminished due to exhaustion of CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cells 31, [47] [48] [49] [50] . The molecular basis for the exhaustion of T FH cells has not been fully understood. It has been reported that CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cells have a high content of HIV-1 DNA and express the cell division marker Ki-67 10 . Therefore, the increase in the number of CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cells is probably due to the activation caused by HIV-1 infection, which leads to their proliferation. It has also been shown that blocking PD-1-PDL interaction in vitro partially restored anti-HIV-1 antibody production 31, 51 . Similarly, in the SIV model, CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cell exhaustion was related to excessive signaling of PD-1, while disruption of PD-1-PDL interaction increased SIV-specific antibody responses 52, 53 .",

Although, the role of T FH cells in the LN and in the blood of HIV-1 infected individuals has been explored 10, 12, 14, 31 , their contribution to HIV-1 infection in the gut mucosal tissues has not been investigated despite the fact that the gut and FRT are the initial sites of HIV entry and early pathogenesis. While the human endocervix and uterus have been shown to contain organized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and large lymphoid aggregates, which are similar to gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) [18] [19] [20] , the presence of T FH cells in FRT has not been previously described. In our study, we identified T FH cells and pre-T FH cells in the FRT and gut of humanized DRAG mice. After HIV-1 infection, the frequency of T FH cells in FRT and PP increased. We also confirmed the presence of T FH cells in human cervical tissue. The identification of T FH cells in the FRT may therefore contribute to the early seeding of HIV-1 infection.",

            "text": "The identification of CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ T FH cells in the gut and FRT of humanized DRAG mice prompted us to evaluate this mouse as an in vivo model for HIV-1 infection. Our data show that DRAG mice are highly susceptible to intravaginal infection with HIV-1. A single low dose intravaginal inoculation with primary HIV-1 (2.54 ng p24) was sufficient to infect 100% of humanized DRAG mice. Therefore the high susceptibility of humanized DRAG mice to HIV-1 infection after intravaginal inoculation is likely related to (i) the high reconstitution of human cells in the female reproductive tract; (ii) the dominance of CD4 + T cell memory phenotype in gut tissues and FRT, (iii) the high levels of expression of HIV-1 coreceptors, and (iv) the accumulation of T FH cells in the gut and FRT. Thus, the humanized DRAG mice represent a suitable model to investigate HIV-1 pathogenesis and opens new opportunities to use this mouse model to study T FH cells in the gut and FRT and to evaluate the efficacy of potential candidate HIV-1 vaccines. Isolation of Lymphocyte from gut, FRT, and SP. The spleen (SP), lymph nodes (LN), mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), entire gut, and the entire female reproductive tract (FRT) were isolated from humanized DRAG mice. Single cell suspensions of SP and mLN were prepared. Peyer's patches (PP) were obtained by locating white patches and plucking off with forceps. Fecal matter and mucus were removed from the mouse gut and FRT, tissues were cut into small fragments, and rinsed with cold PBS. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were extracted by adding IEL extraction buffer (1x HBSS, 1x HEPES, 10% FBS, 5 mM EDTA) to gut tissue. Lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) and FRT cells were obtained using digestion buffer (RPMI, 1x HEPES, 10% FBS, Collagenase VIII (100 du ml \u22121 = 100x) and DNAse Type I (0.1 mg ml \u22121 ). Cells from IEL, LPL, PP, SP, LN, mLN, and FRT from individual humanized DRAG mice were layered on top of a discontinuous percoll gradient (40% and 70%), and centrifuged at 850 g for 20 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were retrieved from the intermediate density fraction, washed in cold PBS, and processed for flow cytometry and/or for cell cultures. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (6-11 color panel) and AQUA LIVE/DEAD stain, and were acquired on a 4-laser LSRII flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Electronic compensation was performed with antibody capture beads (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo Version 9.7.6 (TreeStar).",

Similarly, there was a strong correlation between HIV-1 infectivity (p24), CXCR3 (Fig. 6b middle panel; P = 0.003, R = 0.95) and CCR5 expression (Fig. 6b right panel; P = 0.02, R = 0.90). These results suggest that HIV-1 infectivity is correlated with CCR5 and CXCR3 expression on T FH cells. To confirm that HIV-1 infection for 3 days did not contribute to the upregulation of PD-1 on CD4 + T cells, we sorted LPL cells from uninfected HIV-1 humanized DRAG mice using a BD FACS Aria cell sorter (Supplementary",
