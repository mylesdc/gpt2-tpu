A lack of approved vaccine or drugs currently constitutes a roadblock in controlling disease outbreak and spread. In this study, we generated MERS-CoV VLPs using the baculovirus expression system. Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy results demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs are structurally similar to the native virus. Rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV VLPs and Alum adjuvant induced virus-neutralizing antibodies titers up to 1:40 and induced specific IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD), with endpoint titers reaching 1:1,280. MERS-CoV VLPs also elicited T-helper 1 cell (Th1)mediated immunity, as measured by ELISpot. These data demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs have excellent immunogenicity in rhesus macaques, and represent a promising vaccine candidate.",

Rather, MERS-CoV infection is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as disease is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, MERS-CoV infection can result in kidney failure, ultimately leading to death [1] [2] [3] . As of 29 October 2015, 628 deaths from 1635 cases of MERS-CoV had been identified worldwide, a case fatality rate of 39.02% [4] . Human infections with MERS-CoV typically occur in countries located in the Middle East, but in May 2015 an outbreak was reported in South Korea, in which three superspreaders were found to be responsible for the majority of infections, as well as evidence of tertiary human-to-human transmission [5] . As such, there is an urgent need for the development of an efficacious vaccine against MERS-CoV.",

Inactivated vaccines are safe for use, but typically only induce humoural immunity and very low levels of cell-Research Paper mediated responses. There are no reports of inactivated MERS-CoV being tested as a vaccine, but an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine appears to have little effect in mice and domestic ferrets [6] [7] [8] . Recently, candidate vaccines are genetically engineered to be replication-deficient or avirulent before use, therefore eliminating the concern that live-attenuated vaccines could revert to virulence. A recombinant MERS-CoV lacking the E structural protein was previously developed as a candidate vaccine; however, its protective efficacy has not yet been demonstrated [9] .",

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are protein-only subunit vaccines that emulate the morphology of the native virus. Compared with inactivated or live-attenuated virus vaccines, VLPs are able to induce robust humoural and cellular immune responses without the risk of reversion to virulence [13, 14] . Furthermore, VLPs for any pathogen can be generated under BSL-2 conditions.",

However, in our study co-infection of the MERS-CoV S and M recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells did not result in VLPs formation, as assessed by TEM (data not shown). Rather, we demonstrated that VLPs consisting three structural envelope proteins (S, E, M) can be generated in insect cells with similar morphology to MERS-CoV virions. The expression of S protein from insect cells was slightly larger than that from mammalian cells, suggesting that the glycosylation of our VLPs is complete.

Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 48 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the primary antibodies (mouse polyclonal antibodies against MERS-CoV S, E and M protein, respectively) that contained 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05%Tween 20 (PBST), secondary antibodies (FITC-labeled goat against mouse IgG) and 0.3% Evans blue were added for 50 minutes at room temperature. The cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope after washing.",
