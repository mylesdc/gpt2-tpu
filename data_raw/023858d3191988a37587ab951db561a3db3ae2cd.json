Multiplex real time RT-PCR helps in simultaneous detection of multiple viruses saving cost, time and labour. Commercially available multiplex real time RT-PCR kits are very expensive. Therefore the aim of the present study was to develop a cost effective multiplex real time RT-PCR for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses and compare it with an in-vitro diagnostics approved Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21 Kit (FTD). Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swabs were collected and processed for extraction of nucleic acid using an automated extraction system and multiplex real time RT-PCR was performed using the FTD kit and a custom assay on 356 samples.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are one of the major causes of illness and death worldwide and are the third most common cause of death among children [1] . Acute respiratory infections (ARI) cause more deaths in children < 5 years with most cases reported from India (43 million), China (21 million), Pakistan (10 million), Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria (56 million) [2] . Respiratory infections can be caused by many viruses, both DNA and RNA. These include the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV), Influenza A Virus (Flu A), Influenza B Virus (Flu B), human Adenovirus (HAdV), human Coronavirus (HCoV), human Rhinovirus (HRV), human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human Bocavirus (HBoV) [3] . A new wave of viral diagnosis was established with the development of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques in the 1990s [4] . PCR is more sensitive and rapid than conventional methods for detection of respiratory viruses. Different respiratory viruses present with similar signs and symptoms and can't be differentiated symptomatically or clinically. Tests capable of rapid simultaneous identification of various viruses at the same time can help expedite initiation of appropriate therapy. Uniplex RT-PCR requires individual amplification of each virus under study which is expensive, time consuming and laborious [5] . To overcome this, multiplex real-time PCRs targeting the detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously have been developed commercially but they are very expensive. There is a need to develop cheaper systems for rapid simultaneous identification of various viruses. The present study compares custom real-time multiplex PCR primers and probes for the simultaneous detection of 18 respiratory viruses with an in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) approved fast track diagnostics (FTD) kit.",

The discrepancy in 18 samples which were over detected by the custom assay was resolved by RSV A and RSV B typing. The RSV typing results for the discrepant samples showed that all 18 samples were RSV B. Further all samples positive for RSV A/B by the FTD assay were also subjected to RSV typing which indicated RSV A in 13 (19. During the process of standardisation of the custom assay 3 \u03bcl of viral nucleic acid (positive control) was used for each virus including 4 picomoles of primers and 2 picomoles of probes. Each panel consisted of 3 viruses. In total 9 \u03bcl of viral nucleic acid was used for each panel. While the FTD assay used 10ul of nucleic acid in each tube with primers and probes for 4 viruses, the concentration of primer and probe was not disclosed by FTD. In total 4 \u03bcl more of viral nucleic acid was used in the custom assay compared to the FTD assay which may have increased the sensitivity/detection of different viruses in the custom assay.",

Accordingly, a Ct value of <35 was considered as positive for both assays as per the FTD kit. With the custom assay being run for 40 cycles this reduces the custom assay run time by 8 min, thereby making it only 21 min longer than the FTD assay.",

Similar comparisons were also done in an earlier study [21] where three multiplex PCRs were compared. The turn-around time of the custom assay was 29 min more as compared to the FTD assay. But both the assays reported the results on the same day. The excess time of 29 min taken by the custom assay as compared to the FTD assay may not greatly interfere with the treatment process. However, the custom assay was much more economical costing INR 1500/-per sample for screening 18 respiratory viruses compared to the commercial FTD assay which was expensive costing INR 4300/-per sample. This assay may prove to be highly cost effective in resource limited settings like ours. However the limitation of our study was that some of the viruses showed low positivity as a result it is difficult to assess the concordance accurately. Larger numbers of positive samples need to be tested to evaluate the concordance of these less prevalent viruses.",

The multiplex real time RT-PCR thermal profile for the FTD kit was as follows; 50\u00b0C for 15 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 8 s, 60\u00b0C for 34 s, whereas the thermal profile for the custom assay was set at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s. Standardisation of uniplex real-time PCR (Custom assay) Initial standardisations were done for uniplex real-time PCR using the FTD positive samples as controls. These positive samples included the following viruses namely, HRV, HAdV, Flu A, Pandemic H1N1, Flu B, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4, RSVA/B, HMPV A/B, HPeV, EV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV 229E, HCoV HKU1, (HBoV). AgPath (Ambion) one step RT-PCR master mix was used for the amplification and detection of viral nucleic acid. Briefly, each reaction was performed in a 20 \u03bcl volume which consisted of 12.5 \u03bcl of buffer, 1 \u03bcl of enzyme, 2 picomoles of each primer (corresponding to each virus), 2 picomoles of probe (corresponding to each virus) (synthesised by Life Technologies)",
