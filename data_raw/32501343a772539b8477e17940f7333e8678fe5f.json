The present study compares the kinetics of [ 18 F]FDG and three other PET tracers with relevance for infection imaging. Methods. A juvenile porcine osteomyelitis model was used. Eleven pigs underwent PET/CT with 60-minute dynamic PET imaging of [ 18 F]FDG, [ 68 Ga]Ga-citrate, [ 11 C]methionine, and/or [ 11 C]donepezil, along with blood sampling. For infectious lesions, kinetic modelling with one-and two-tissue-compartment models was conducted for each tracer. Results. Irreversible uptake was found for [ 18 F]FDG and [ 68 Ga]Ga-citrate; reversible uptake was found for [ 11 C]methionine (two-tissue model) and [ 11 C]donepezil (one-tissue model). The uptake rate for [ 68 Ga]Ga-citrate was slow and diffusion-limited. For the other tracers, the uptake rate was primarily determined by perfusion (flow-limited uptake). Net uptake rate for [ 18 F]FDG and distribution volume for [ 11 C]methionine were significantly higher for infectious lesions than for correspondingly noninfected tissue. For [ 11 C]donepezil in pigs, labelled metabolite products appeared to be important for the analysis. Conclusions. The kinetics of the four studied tracers in infection was characterized. For clinical applications, [ 18 F]FDG remains the first-choice PET tracer. [ 11 C]methionine may have a potential for detecting soft tissue infections. [ 68 Ga]Ga-citrate and [ 11 C]donepezil were not found useful for imaging of osteomyelitis.",

Methionine (natural or labelled) is transported into cells via the Ltype amino acid transporter 1. It is crucial for the formation of proteins and is involved in the synthesis of phospholipids. The accumulation of methionine therefore reflects amino acid transport and protein synthesis. During cell replication, the demand for essential amino acids increases, as do protein and phospholipid synthesis. Although primarily used to detect malignant tumours [11] , methionine is known from brain studies to accumulate in inflammatory tissue [12, 13] . Furthermore, a high uptake of [ 11 C]methionine has been observed after acute myocardial infarction, indicating that this tracer may be a good marker of inflammatory reactions during the phase of tissue repair [14] .",

It was recently shown that the AChE ligand [ 11 C]donepezil accumulates at sites of bacterial infection, suggesting that cholinergic PET imaging may have potential in the detection of inflammation and infections [18] . Therefore, we investigated the uptake processes of these PET tracers in order to determine their clinical potential in infection imaging in relation to both osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection. We hypothesized that (1) categorization of tracers into those having either reversible or irreversible uptake in infectious lesions is possible and (2) perfusion effects on tracer accumulation can be estimated.

Briefly, osteomyelitis was induced in the right hind limb of juvenile Danish Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire female pigs by intra-arterial injection of S. aureus (porcine strain S54F9). The injection was performed into the right femoral artery, allowing for selective infection of this hind limb while leaving the contralateral left hind limb as a noninfected control. Osteomyelitis was allowed to develop for one week, after which the pig was scanned and then euthanized. If a pig reached predefined humane endpoints, it was then euthanized (and not scanned). A refinement of the model, combining reduced body weight of the pigs (from 40 kg to 20 kg) with administration of penicillin at the onset of the first clinical signs of disease, proved effective in reducing systemic infection [21] .",

Using full FOV data ensures that the statistical noise is low. Restricting this fit to the early data has several advantages. First, this focuses on the part of the study where the input function changes fast and the delay therefore is important. Second, this means that physiological differences in uptake (e.g., bladder versus nonbladder, infection versus noninfection) will only have had little time to manifest; thus the full FOV data will be dominated by the bolus passage in this anatomical part of the animal, rather than by a mix of physiologies.

Therefore, some level of pragmatism is needed when setting up or choosing a model. Strictly irreversible uptake (in the sense of the molecules staying in the body for life) is rare, but the efflux level from a compartment may be practically zero relative to the length of the PET acquisition. In the present study, we attempted to find a level that makes the models useful for providing information about the uptake process while accepting a level of pragmatism to distinguish \"practically irreversible\" from \"practically reversible\" uptake.",

Relative to infection, the kinetic modelling of [ 18 F]FDG uptake appears only to have been performed in lung studies (reviewed in [38] ) and in a single study of an acute viral infection [39] .

Uptake will either require extravasation of the large [ 68 Ga]Ga-transferrin complex or require a twostep process, such as the release of 68 Ga from the protein before the uptake or the uptake of [ 68 Ga]Ga-transferrin by leukocytes which then enter tissue [44] . Therefore, even though bacteria may show increased uptake of gallium due to its chemical similarities with iron [43] , the overall uptake mechanism appears to be quite slow. For static imaging, slow uptake favours late imaging. Physically, the half-life of 68 Ga restricts imaging to a few hours after injection. In a study of lung lesions, Vorster et al.

[48] who saw only minor metabolism of [ 11 C]donepezil (>85% remaining after 30 minutes) and therefore did not need metabolite correction. Also, Hiraoka et al. found the rev2TCM to be unequivocally better than the 1TCM, while our study finds the distinction less clear.
