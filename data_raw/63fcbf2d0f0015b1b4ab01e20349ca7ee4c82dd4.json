Members of this family include both human pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) 1 , and animal pathogens, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 2 . Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes four genera in the Coronaviridae family: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. While the reservoirs of the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera are believed to be bats, the Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genera have been shown to spread primarily through birds 3 . The first three species of the Deltacoronavirus genus were discovered in 2009 4 and recent work has vastly expanded the Deltacoronavirus genus, adding seven additional species 3 .",

There are currently two recognized species in the Gammacoronavirus genus: avian coronavirus (ACoV) and beluga whale coronavirus SW1 (SW1). ACoVs infect multiple avian hosts and include several important poultry pathogens, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) 5 . IBV was first described in the United States 6 but has since been described around the globe 7 . Turkey Coronavirus is the cause of acute enteritis in domestic turkeys 8 . The second species in the Gammacornavirus genus SW1 was first discovered in beluga whales 9 but has since been detected in other cetaceans, such as Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins 10 . Despite IBV being the first discovered coronavirus and the impact it has on the poultry industry 11 , the number of identified species within the Gammacoronavirus genus remains small in comparison to the other coronavirus genera. Coronaviruses from several other avian hosts for which partial sequences are available suggest relatedness to IBV and TCoV. These viruses, which include goose coronavirus (GCoV), were tentatively classified as part of the ACoV species. An approximately 3 kb region, including the nucleocapsid gene and several accessory genes, of GCoV were previously sequenced from a greylag goose in Norway 12 .",

            "text": "Due to the remote location of the die off, samples from the dead birds were not collected immediately and sent to a diagnostic laboratory until severe predation and decomposition had occurred. The poor sample quality, in addition to the difficulty of coronavirus isolation, led to the failure to isolate infectious virus using standard methods. However, the complete genome of a novel gammacoronavirus was assembled from high throughput sequencing reads derived from the cloacal swab of a single Canada goose. The assembled genome of the novel Canada goose coronavirus (CGCoV) is 28,539 nts in length (excluding the poly(A) tail) and has 38.4% GC-content. The genome of CGCoV is approximately 1000 nts longer than the reference genomes for ACoV available in GenBank. The genome organization of CGCoV is presented in Fig. 1 . The 5\u2032 UTR of CGCoV is 553 nt in length and contains a higher GC content (48.3%) relative to the genome as a whole. The 5\u2032 UTR of CGCoV shares only 68% pairwise identity with that of duck coronavirus (DCoV) and 47.5% pairwise identity to that of SW1. Like all coronavirus genomes reported to date, CGCoV's genome is dominated by the coding regions for the large polyproteins 1a and 1ab, followed by the structural and accessory genes. The heptanucleotide slippery sequence UUUAAAC, associated with the ribosomal slippage that produces polyprotein 1ab, was present at nt positon 11,995. CGCoV's genome contains genes for all four structural proteins common to coronaviruses; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition, CGCoV contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs) predicted to encode accessory proteins. The order of the structural and accessory protein-coding ORFs in CGCoV resembles that of ACoV, but there are notable differences. The general genome organization of ACoV is 1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b 13 . However, there is some variance in the genome organization within the ACoV species. For example, Australian IBV strains lack ORFs 4a, 4b and 5b 14 . Overall, CGCoV contains a larger number (n = 14) of ORFs coding for predicted accessory and structural proteins downstream of the polyprotein 1ab coding region. Two additional ORFs (7a and 7b) are found between the CGCoV M and N ORFs. There are also two additional ORFs (10 and 11) following the N gene. While some ACoVs do have ORFs following the N gene, ORFs 10 and 11 in CGCoV do not share obvious homology to those of IBV and TCoV. The 3\u2032 UTR of CGCoV is 301 nucleotides in length and contains the stem loop-like motif 113 bp upstream from the poly(A) tail. This stem loop-like motif was first identified in astroviruses 15 but is also present in ACoVs and SARS-CoV 13 . Further downstream in the 3\u2032 UTR, the octanucleotide motif (GGAAGAGC) is found 71 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. The 3\u2032 UTR of CGCoV shares 98% pairwise identity to the partially sequenced GCoV and 84% pairwise identity to IBV.",

The TRS of CGCoV is identical to that identified by Cao et al. (2008) as the TRS of TCoV (CTTAACAAA). Body TRS's regulate viral gene expression by forming a complex with the leader TRS, causing discontinuous transcription of mRNA 16 . Ten putative body TRSs were found in the 3\u2032 end of the CGCoV genome (Fig. 1) . Four of the ten putative TRSs (4, 6, 8, 9) were exact matches to the canonical leader TRS. Three TRSs (2, 7, 11) contained one mismatch and the remaining three TRSs (3, 5, 10) contained two mismatches to the leader TRS. The functionality of these TRSs would need to be experimentally determined; however, previous studies have shown that TRSs of ACoVs are subject to some variation 13, 17 . CGCoV contains twice the number of TRS's as ACoVs and a similar number compared to the nine contained in SW1 9 . Table 1 demonstrates the nucleotide distances between the TRS and the start codon of ORFs found in CGCoV's, which are comparable to those of TCoV 13 .",

For example, there are no homologues to ACoV's 3a or 3b accessory proteins in CGCoV, a trait shared with SW1. Furthermore, CGCoV has a number of ORFs that do not appear to have homologues in other sequenced Gammacoronavirus species, such as the ORFs for putative proteins 3 and 4a (Fig. 1) . These two ORFs are found in CGCoV in the corresponding location of ACoV's 3a and 3b ORFs (between the S and E ORFs) and are also similar in size to ACoV's 3a and 3b proteins. However, they share no obvious sequence similarity with any 3a or 3b gene, or any other entry in NCBI (Table 1) . ACoV's 3a and 3b proteins have been shown to be unnecessary for replication 20 , however knock-out mutants for these accessory genes are attenuated 21 . The IBV's 3 gene is functionally tricistronic, meaning the 3a, 3b and E proteins are under the control of a single TRS 22, 23 . This is not the case www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in CGCoV, as the E ORF of CGCoV shares a TRS with only the 4a ORF in CGCoV and 3 ORF is preceded by a separate TRS (Fig. 1 ).",

Two of these ORFs (5b and 7a) are ACoV 4b homologues, likely the result of gene duplication. This area in IBV has been identified as a hotspot for recombination 24 . The region between the ACoV M and 5 gene was formally called the intergenic region because of the lack of a TRS. However, it was later shown that gene 4 is expressed using an alternative TRS in IBV 17 . Notably, one of the 4b homologs (i.e. 5b) in CGCoV does have a TRS (Fig. 1) . The use of template switching at TRSs is thought to lend to recombination in coronaviruses 25 . The two CGCoV 4b homologs are not identical to each other (Table 1) . Amino acid sequence identity to other 4b proteins is low for both CGCoV 4b homologues, 41% to IBV and 23% to DCoV respectively.

In addition, ORFs 10 and 11, which are preceded by the nucleocapsid gene, also share high amino acid identity with graylag GCoV proteins, 92% and 81% respectively. It should be noted that, among full and partial genomes of gammacoronaviruses sequenced to date, ORFs 10 and 11 seem to be unique to CGCoV and GCoV and are both preceded by a TRS, suggesting that these ORFs are very likely expressed.
