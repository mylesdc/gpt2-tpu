The set of all such feasible D may be a subset of the D that satisfy equation (S6) because variance-covariance matrices have additional constraints on their elements. Of course, if the decay rate of the autocorrelation is what will be used to determine the distance to the threshold, it is important for the autocorrelation of i to be close to the reference function at multiple lags. In general, one could find the D that ensures this by calculating the set of suitable D at each of several lags and finding the intersection of those sets. In the case of a two dimensional system, there is a single lag at which any deviation in the autocorrelation of variable i from that of the reference function is maximized. To see this, observe that in this case b has one component that is 0 and two other components which include the factor |e \u03bb1\u03c4 \u2212 e \u03bb2\u03c4 |.

This magnitude is proportional to the angles between the vector pointing from \u00b1 a to b and the vector pointing from \u00b1 a to \u2213 a. Those vectors are the normal vectors of the planes that bound the region in which the autocorrelation is within of the reference function. As the magnitude of b approaches zero, the vectors approach being negatives of each other and almost all possible D result in an error less than . This result is consistent with the intuition that for sufficiently large or small lags, all exponentially decaying functions of the lag with the same initial value will be close to each other. As the magnitude of b grows, the boundary plane normal vectors both rotate toward each other and the region of suitable D contracts into itself. Therefore, to ensure that the autocorrelation of variable i is within of the reference function for all lags, it suffices to find suitable D when |b| is maximal, which corresponds to \u03c4 = (log |\u03bb 2 | \u2212 log |\u03bb 1 |)/(\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb 2 ).",

Figure S1 shows that we found the sensitivity of the accuracy to depend on R 0 . In small populations, stochastic elimination of the disease occured frequently, which made the autocorrelation function much different from the prediction made for large populations. Consequently, the distance was consistently overestimated for populations less than 10 5 when R 0 = 16 ( fig. S1 ). On the other hand, accuracy was similar across all population sizes when R 0 = 0.1. It seems that the Gaussian solution based on large population sizes can still provide a good approximation to the autocorrelation when the population size is fairly small. In short, it seems that in some cases our methods may be reliable with data from population sizes as small as 100. Figure S1 : The sensitivity of the accuracy of distance estimates to population size depends on R 0 . The true value is marked with an 'x'.

            "text": "Although we found that observation of the number infected could provide accurate distance estimates when the system is subject to intrinsic noise only, figure 2 indicates that deviations from intrinsic noise can change the situation. Thus we next examined the distance estimates with increasing amounts of environmental noise in the death rate. As expected, the R 0 = 0.1 panel of figure S2 shows that for sufficiently large amounts environmental noise, the estimates of distance based on Y become inaccurate. However, the amount of noise required to seriously compromise accuracy is large. Figure S3 shows that environmental noise is slow to change the decay of the autocorrelation at short lags, and thus the robustness of the accuracy is a consequence of our distance estimates being sensitive to the rapid decay at short lags. Note that a typical approach when calculating early warning indicators is to look for trends in the autocorrelation at a single lag, and for large enough lags trends in such indicators could mistakenly identify increasing noise in the death rate for an approach to an epidemic threshold. However, we have also noticed that for 20 year time series the increases in the autocorrelation due to environmental noise are typically below their long-term expected value ( figure S4) , which serves to reduce the effect relative to that expected from figure S3 and also contributes to the robustness of our distance estimates. If the estimated autocorrelations from the 20 year time series looked like those in figure S3 , the estimates based on Y would be much more similar to those based on X when the standard deviation in the death rate was 1 and the population size was 10 9 . From the definition of the m terms in equation (2.9), it can be seen that environmental noise in the death rate increases the covariance of perturbations of X and Y . In contrast, environmental noise in the force of infection makes that covariance more negative. To more thoroughly examine the effects of deviations from pure intrinsic noise we also evaluated distance estimates from simulations with environmental noise in the force of infection. Estimates in He et al. [1] for the standard deviation of such noise from measles case reports range from 0.038 to 0.096. Estimates from the analysis of polio case reports in Martinez-Bakker et al. [2] for the standard deviation of noise in the force of infection range from 1.6 \u00b7 10 \u22123 to 0.68 (personal communication with P. Rohani). Figure S5 plots distance to threshold estimates from simulations having noise levels that bracket these noise parameter estimates. In contrast to the case of noise in the death rate, distance estimates are not affected by high levels of noise when R 0 = 0.1, but they are affected when R 0 is equal to 2 or 16. We inspected the time series in these cases and noticed that the variation in the force of infection leads to frequent interruption of the regular cycles that characterize the dynamics in the presence of intrinsic noise. Bret\u00f3 et al. [3] have noted that environmental noise in the transmission rate can cause such irregularities. Although one could certainly attempt to adapt the distance estimation procedure to such dynamics, our goal was simply to describe a basic procedure and identify some of its limitations.",

            "text": "Having a method to estimate the distance to the threshold opens up the possibility of estimating whether the distance to the threshold is changing over time. A simple way to do this is to look at the change in distance estimates between two windows of a time series. Figure S6 shows some results using this simple approach. As one might expect from the variance of the distance estimates apparent in figure 3 , the estimated changes in distance were also highly variable ( figure S6, bottom) . However, the distribution of estimates is dense in the neighborhood of the true value, and estimates with the wrong sign are relatively infrequent. Thus it seems one may be able to be much more confident about statements of whether or not the threshold is getting closer than about estimates of how fast the distance is changing. Population size, N 0 10 7 10 9 Figure S2 : The accuracy of distance estimates is not affected by environmental noise in the death rate parameter until the variation becomes extreme, which is apparent in the case that R 0 = 0.1 and N 0 = 10 9 . The true distance is marked with an '\u00d7'. Parameter \u03b7 was fixed to 1/(3 \u221a 10 7 ). Other parameters were in table 1. Parameter \u03b2 was set to R 0 (\u03b3 + \u00b5). The color of the plotted points indicates the state variable on which the estimates were based. Example of data used to estimate the change in distance. A distance estimate was obtained using the data in each window. (Bottom) The distribution of the estimates of change in distance from 1000 replicates. The gray line marks the change in the true distance between the middle of the windows. We consider this line to mark the true value for the estimated change in distance.
