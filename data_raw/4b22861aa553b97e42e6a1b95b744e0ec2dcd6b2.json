Thirty participants at a Midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios: 3 mask designs (n = 10), 2 gown designs (n = 10), or 2 glove designs (n = 10). Participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. Their performances were video-recorded and reviewed with participants. Semistructured interviews about their doffing approaches were conducted and audio-recorded, then transcribed and thematically analyzed.",

Doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off). Cognitive processes during doffing largely pertained to tracking contaminated PPE surfaces, examining PPE design cues (eg, straps), or improvising based on prior experience from training or similar PPE designs. Doffing barriers and facilitators typically related to PPE design, such as PPE fit (or lack of it) and fastener type. Some participants also described personal barriers (eg, glasses, long hair); however, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers.",

When HCWs doff complex PPE for a high-risk scenario such as EVD, they often make errors during key \"vulnerable processes, \" including when reaching for equipment during the doffing process and when removing respirators and hoods [8] [9] [10] . During more routine contact precautions, HCWs often selfcontaminate when removing gloves [2, 12] and gowns [7, 13] . Several factors may contribute to self-contamination, including poorly fitting or \"universally sized\" PPE [14] [15] [16] , difficulty distinguishing between dirty (outside) and clean (inside) surfaces while doffing [14] , and forceful or rushed movements [14, 17] . HCWs may use incorrect doffing sequences or methods that do not work well with the PPE design [17] . Furthermore, doffing protocols are often not standardized [15] , and HCWs may receive suboptimal and inconsistent PPE training [18] , leading to further confusion regarding appropriate doffing approaches.",

After the codebook was finalized, J. B. coded the remaining transcripts. To further enhance reliability, a second coder (J. P. S.) randomly selected and coded 2 transcripts from each simulation scenario (6 total, or 20% of all transcripts). The 2 coders met to compare the coded content and found that the codebook did not need to be revised. They discussed coding differences until they reached agreement. After coding the overarching themes, J. B. examined the coded content within each theme to identify and enumerate the most prominent response patterns, which he compared and grouped together into subthemes using comparative analyses [23] . Finally, to identify any systematic differences, we determined whether occurrence of subthemes varied across PPE types and designs and by HCW type. Table 1 . We identified 3 overarching interview themes: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies focused on how participants generally approached doffing PPE. Cognitive processes focused on what participants thought about or paid attention to while doffing PPE, chiefly reflecting how they carried out the strategies or how they overcame unanticipated issues and doffing barriers. Barriers and facilitators addressed factors that helped or hindered doffing (eg, PPE design, personal factors). Table 2 includes exemplar quotes to illustrate each theme.",

About half of the participants (n = 17) also described doffing expediently, which involved approaches to doffing PPE quickly and with minimal burden (eg, ripping PPE off) or using shortcuts and work-arounds (often initiated at donning; eg, not fastening gown straps).

However, most participants described using both strategies to doff gowns and typically did not see much conflict or tension between them. While ripping gowns was not perceived as inherently unsafe, some participants described difficulties ripping gowns off in a controlled manner or described other barriers (see Cognitive Processes and Barriers and Facilitators).

For example, a common barrier was the (perceived) need to untie certain mask and gown designs (n = 14). Knots were often behind participants' heads or backs, making them hard to find or hard to reach (particularly for HCWs with mobility issues). Sometimes knots were also hard to untie. Furthermore, when untied, the loose fasteners or the PPE itself could be hard to control and could pose a contamination risk. Several participants described workarounds that prevented or minimized the problem of untying PPE (n = 5), such as tying just 1 knot, not tying the fasteners while donning, or simply ripping the PPE off rather than untying the fasteners. However, ripping off PPE was not easy with certain designs (n = 7), particularly the masks with bands and the gowns with thicker belts. Some participants also found the gown with the tape-tab neck closure harder to rip off in a predictable and controlled way. While gloves were not associated with the barriers described above, several participants (n = 6) described difficulty safely doffing the glove on the second hand (because the other hand was exposed). PPE fit was also a barrier to doffing all types of PPE (n = 10), typically when PPE fit too tightly. However, while 2 participants found tighter-fitting gowns harder to doff, 2 participants found looser-fitting gowns harder to doff. Participants also identified personal barriers (n = 10), such as wearing personal items (glasses, watches), having long hair, and having mobility issues. However, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. For example, procedure masks with ear loops were the easiest to doff for participants who wore glasses. Some participants also admitted that they struggled to recall the correct doffing approach, but they generally described remembering or \"figuring out\" how to doff correctly. Finally, 3 participants explicitly commented on the benefit of using familiar PPE designs because it allowed them to rely on their doffing habits.",

Physicians were less likely to report doffing expediently, which could either mean they are less likely to acknowledge during an in-person interview that they doff expediently or that doffing expediently is less salient to them. The difference in salience could be due to differences in clinical practice workflows. For example, Harrod et al found that during routine care, physicians (and physical therapists) don and doff PPE much less frequently than nurses [26] . This suggests that different HCWs groups have unique PPE needs and challenges and that each group may require a training program tailored to their clinical practice. We also found that students were more likely to report tracking potentially contaminated PPE surfaces and looking for PPE design cues. While other HCW types may have simply omitted this information from their responses (eg, it may be self-evident to them that one would do those things while doffing), it may also suggest that more experienced HCWs have internalized cognitive processes associated with specific tasks and, thus, may perform tasks such as PPE doffing without consciously processing relevant information, relying rather on muscle memory and habits.",

Design cues could help HCWs envision and execute appropriate doffing methods; for example, color-coding PPE surfaces to differentiate \"dirty\" outside surfaces from \"clean\" inside surfaces could help HCWs track where these surfaces are at each step of the doffing process [16, 27] . Fasteners (eg, straps, belts) that do not require untying and are easy to undo (or rip) quickly would facilitate speed and ease of doffing [16, 27] . PPE also must fit people of different sizes and physical abilities and should be either adjustable or available in several sizes [14, 27] . In addition, new doffing methods and additional training may be required to optimize HCWs' doffing of redesigned PPE. The new PPE designs and doffing methods also must be rigorously tested, not only for efficacy in \"ideal\" and controlled settings but also for effectiveness in practice. If HCWs use work-arounds to avoid doffing PPE with cumbersome but safe methods, it may be prudent to design PPE that leads to fewer work-arounds and allows for better compliance with doffing methods in practice, even if such designs and methods are shown to be somewhat less safe in controlled settings. In addition to efficacy and effectiveness studies, well-designed ethnographic and human factors approaches can help us better understand the variety of factors that influence HCWs' ability to doff in routine clinical practice, where and why critical errors occur, and how to improve usability of PPE and doffing methods.",

Our findings indicate that HCWs draw on prior training experiences when encountering new PPE designs or facing doffing barriers, suggesting that PPE training should cover the range of PPE types and designs HCWs may encounter in clinical practice and the most appropriate doffing methods for each. HCWs should also be given just-in-time training if their standard PPE is replaced with a new style during shortages or vendor changes. Furthermore, HCWs could benefit from training that would help them assess how to doff unfamiliar PPE or improvise solutions when they encounter doffing barriers or PPE failures (eg, if the gown shreds into multiple pieces). New training approaches must be tested for effectiveness [18] . While computerized training may be prevalent [18] , HCWs may prefer hands-on practical training [24] , which would also allow for feedback on self-contamination with fluorescent markers [2] and would allow HCWs to develop muscle memory. HCWs at different stages (eg, in-school vs on-the-job training) may also need different training approaches. Thus, training protocols should accommodate HCWs' level of experience and the work they perform.",

Hospitals should consider assembling interdisciplinary teams to periodically review and revise their PPE protocols [16] . PPE protocols must be clear and unambiguous in order to provide guidance for key processes, from PPE selection to its use in practice. After carefully examining their PPE needs, hospitals could eliminate unnecessary variation in PPE designs to minimize the likelihood that HCWs would encounter unfamiliar PPE, and they could procure PPE that is safe and expedient to use and doff. Furthermore, hospitals could tailor their PPE training approaches for the PPE available at their institution in order to increase the likelihood that HCWs use appropriate doffing methods. HCWs may require refresher training, particularly if new PPE designs are introduced into practice or they start working in new settings that use different PPE designs. To maintain or improve performance over time, hospitals should monitor compliance with PPE use and doffing protocols and investigate reasons for poor performance.",

Common influences (eg, institutional policies and procedures, training, available PPE) may have limited the range of perspectives we identified in the study. However, participants' work experience (in years) varied substantially. Thus, participants likely were initially trained at different times, in different institutions, and with different PPE designs, which should mitigate this limitation. Second, the simulation context of our study (eg, presence of observers, simulation room, recording, fluorescent marker, other prompts) may have influenced participants to pay closer attention to doffing and particularly to avoiding self-contamination, leading them to adopt different doffing approaches than they use in practice, or bias their interview responses. Furthermore, in a simulation study, we could not account for the range of tasks and circumstances that HCWs encounter in day-to-day practice but may influence doffing performance (eg, carrying objects while doffing [17] ). Thus, we may have not explored the full range of factors that influence HCWs' PPE doffing practice.",

(nurse)\u2022 [I'm] trying to have the least amount of contact with the exterior of either mask\u2026just hold it away and get it off without touching. (respiratory therapist)\u2022 I just start pulling it, the gown, because I always take the gown off first. But, that leaves for splashing, because it splashed my face\u2026. So maybe next time I need to actually untie it, instead of just ripping it. (nurse)\u2022 I think I was a little bit more careful than when you're just exiting the room, you kind of just rip it off. (student)\u2022 I had trouble undoing the knot, I was just going to tear it, but I got it out finally. I would normally tear it off\u2026.I get frustrated and, you know, I'm kind of busy, so I don't want to sit there futzing with it. (physician) This is the knot that I can't see, but I tied it the same way as the other one, with the single pull to release. (nurse)\u2022 I usually don't use them [gown straps] because then--, well, I'm trying to stay clean, and pulling them off is more of a process, to try and stay clean\u2026 I feel like it's, like, trying to untie it would be more apt to contaminate the backside. (nurse)\u2022 Try to figure out a way to get it to not splash.[I: Mm-hmm.] But it's so hard to when you have to rip it. So the force of it can make something fly off the gown. (nurse) \u2022 It's the most difficult part for me\u2026. You try not to contaminate, but then your glasses are there and you don' know what to do. (physician) \u2022 If I get my arms in there [inside the gown] it gives me a little bit more mobility\u2026.If it's on there, you can almost grip it from the inside, cause they're so big. They're big on everybody, they're not going to fit me. (student)",
