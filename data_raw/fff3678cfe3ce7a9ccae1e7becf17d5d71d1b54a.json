Non uniform usage of synonymous codons for a specific amino acid during translation of protein known as codon usage bias (CUB) is a unique property of the genome and shows species specific deviation. Analysis of codon usage bias with compositional dynamics of coding sequences has contributed to the better understanding of the molecular mechanism and the evolution of a particular gene. In this study, the complete nucleotide coding sequences of TP53 gene from eight different mammalian species were used for CUB analysis. Our results showed that the codon usage patterns in TP53 gene across different mammalian species has been influenced by GC bias particularly GC 3 and a moderate bias exists in the codon usage of TP53 gene. Moreover, we observed that nature has highly favored the most over represented codon CTG for leucine amino acid but selected against the ATA codon for isoleucine in TP53 gene across all mammalian species during the course of evolution.",

Many genomic factors such as gene length, GC-content, recombination rate, gene expression level, or modulation in the genetic code are associated with CUB in different organisms [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In general, compositional constraints under natural selection or mutation pressure are considered as major factors in the codon usage variation among different organisms [8, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, studies revealed that mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment play a major role in the codon usage pattern of organisms [26] . In unicellular and multicellular organisms it was observed that, preferred synonymous codons/optimal codons with abundant tRNA gene copy number rise with gene expression level within the genome that supports selection on high codon bias confirmed by positive correlation between optimal codons and tRNA abundance [18, 22, 27] . Urrutia and Hurst (2003) reported weak correlation between gene expression level and codon usage bias within human genome though not related with tRNA abundance [19] . However, Comeron (2004) observed that in human genome, highly expressed genes have preference towards codon bias favoring codons with most abundant tRNA gene copy number compared to less highly expressed genes [28] .",

Codon usage bias may be superimposed on the effect of natural selection. The amount of protein produced from the mRNA transcript may vary significantly since the translational properties of alternate synonymous codons are not equivalent [31] . Several studies have further shown that codon usage bias is associated with highly expressed genes as some codons are used more often than others in the coding sequences [32] . Moreover, literature suggested that a gene can be epitomized not only by the sequence of its amino acid but also by its codon usage patterns shaped by the balance between mutational bias and natural selection [33] . As a consequence of selection pressure within a gene, differentiation in codon bias may arise between species of the same genus.",

In our analysis, nearly all codons ending with G/C base showed positive correlation with GC bias and nearly all A/T-ending codons showed negative correlation with GC bias. But, 8 G/C-ending codons (ATC, ACG, TAC, TTG, TCC, CAC, GTG, GGG) showed negative correlation with GC bias whereas 6 A/T-ending codons (AAT, ATT, TGT, CGA, GTA, GGA) showed positive correlation with AT bias although statistically not significant (p>0.05). Two G-ending codons i.e. TCG for serine and CTG for leucine amino acid showed strong positive correlation (p<0.01) with GC 3s , indicating that codon usage has been influenced by GC bias due to GC 3s . Interestingly, we observed that the codon ATA encoding isoleucine amino acid was not favored by natural selection in TP53 genes across mammalian species during the course of evolution. Thus, scanning the codon usage pattern provides the basis of the mechanism for synonymous codon usage bias and has both practical as well as theoretical significance in gaining clues of understanding molecular biology [34] .",

The mean percentage of GC and AT compositions was 57.3% and 42.7% respectively. Thus, the overall nucleotide composition suggested that the nucleotide C and G occurred more frequently compared to A and T in the coding sequences of TP53 gene across the mammalian species. The nucleotide composition at the third position of codon (A 3 ,T 3 ,G 3 ,C 3 ) showed that the mean values of C 3 and G 3 were the highest followed by T 3 and A 3 . The GC 3 values (ranged from 58.7%-70.6%, mean = 65.1%, SD = 0.040) was compared with that of AT 3 values (ranged from 29.4%-41.3%, mean = 34.9%, SD = 0.040) in the coding sequences of TP53 genes. The average percentage of GC contents at the first and second codon positions (GC 12 ) was found in the range of 52.6% to 54.9% with a mean value of 53.4% and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.008. Therefore, nucleotide composition analysis suggested that GC-ending codons might be preferred over AT-ending codons in the coding sequences of TP53 genes across the selected mammalian species. Further, we calculated the occurrence of frequently used optimal codons (Fop) for each amino acid as suggested by Lavner and Kotler (2005) [14] . The frequency was allied with statistical analysis to find out the highest and lowest frequently used codon. Our results showed that the most frequently used codons were G/C-ending for the corresponding amino acid (Fig. 2) in TP53 genes across mammalian species.",

The RSCU value greater than 1.6 indicates over represented codon for the corresponding amino acid. The overall RSCU values in the selected coding sequences of TP53 gene revealed that 25 codons were most frequently used among the 59 codons and the most predominantly used codons were G/C-ending compared to A/T-ending (Table 2) . Besides, it was observed that C-ending codon was mostly favored compared to G-ending codon in the coding sequence of TP53 gene among the selected mammalian species. Our results showed marked similarities as reported by Dass et al., (2012) in serotonin receptor gene family from different mammalian species [35] . Further, clustering analysis of RSCU values (Fig. 3) depicted that the codon GCC, CGC (except Rattus norvegicus), ATC (except Tupaia chinensis), CTG, ACC (except Rattus norvegicus, Macaca mulatta), GTG (except Felis catus) were displayed as the over represented codons (RSCU>1.6). The highest RSCU value was found for the codon CTG for leucine amino acid in all TP53 genes across mammalian species. The codon ATA showed the RSCU value zero because natural selection has not favored this codon in TP53 gene across mammalian species.",

Nabiyouni et al., (2013) reported that eukaryotic organisms with very high GC-contents have high GC 3 -composition while organisms with low GC-content have low GC 3 -composition in the genome [37] . We also calculated GC 3 skew values which ranged from 0.000 to -0.094, indicating that GC 3 composition at the third position of codon might have played an important role in the codon usage bias [38] . Negative GC skew was observed in all the coding sequences of TP53 gene which revealed that the abundance of C over G [39] . In addition, lower values of the frequency of optimal codons (FOP) and the effective number of codons (ENC) along with higher GC contents suggested that a moderate bias exists in the usage of synonymous codons [33] for TP53 gene in different mammalian species. Predominant codon usage bias was observed in TP53 gene of M.unguiculatus compared to other mammalian species (Table 3) . RCBS value of a gene can be used as an effective measure of predicting gene expression and its value depends on the patterns of codon usage along with nucleotide compositional bias of a gene [20] . The distribution of RCBS values for TP53 gene across eight mammalian species is shown in figure below (Fig. 6) . The RCBS values ranged from 0.006 to 0.065 with a mean value of 0.039 and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.021.

The majority of frequently used codons were G/C ending in which C-ending codons were mostly favored compared to G-ending codons for the corresponding amino acid. The most over-represented codon was CTG encoding the amino acid leucine in the TP53 gene of all the selected mammalian species. We further observed that the codon ATA encoding isoleucine was selected against by nature in TP53 genes across the mammalian species under study during the course of evolution. The codon usage pattern for TP53 in H. sapiens showed resemblance to that of M. mulatta; similarly, F. catus to C. lupus and M. unguiculatus to R. norvigicus. Moderate codon bias was observed for the TP53 gene in different mammalian species. The codon usage patterns in the coding sequence of TP53 gene across different mammalian species showed significant similarities, suggesting that the evolutionary pattern might be similar. According to Yang and Nielsen (2008) , codon bias in mammals is mainly influenced by mutation bias and the selection on codon bias is weak for nearly neutral synonymous mutations [40] . From the outstanding work of Grantham et al., (1980 Grantham et al., ( -1981 on \"genome hypothesis\" it was evident that species specific genes share similar spectrum of codon usage frequency [41, 42] . The present study revealed that specific gene of closely related species with similar functions exhibit similar patterns of codon bias across different mammals as evident from the previous work of Dass et al., (2012) [35] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the codon usage pattern in TP53 gene across the mammalian species. Since our analysis has given better insights into the codon usage, it may have theoretical value in further understanding the molecular evolution of TP53gene.",

The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 8 cds sequences.
