            "text": "A new application of antibodies is to use them as macromolecular chaperones. Protein antigens usually have multiple epitopes, thus, there may be a plurality of antibodies binding to one antigen. However, not all antibodies that bind to one antigen could act as a chaperone. Experiments show that some screened anti-human creatine kinase single chain antibodies (scFV) could assist in the folding and stabilizing of the enzyme, while others could not. We built the model of the single chain antibody (scFv-A4) that increased the stability of human creatine kinase (HCK) by the homology modeling method. Epitopes of human creatine kinase were predicted by computer and then the binding of scFv-A4 and HCK was modeled with computer. The calculation results were further combined with the peptide array membrane experiment results to obtain reliable models for the scFv-A4-HCK complex. Based on the above study we gave an explanation about how scFv-A4 could act as a macromolecular chaperone assisting the folding of HCK. This study provides an approach for predicting antigen-antibody binding mode and also a useful theoretical guidance for the study of antibodies' chaperone-like function.

            "text": "In recent years, a number of human diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases, were reported to be related to the misfolding and aggregation of proteins [1, 2] . Molecular chaperones are a kind of protein that are capable of assisting nascent peptides in correctly folding to functional proteins by binding to the folding intermediate to avoid kinetic traps, suppressing aggregation of the substrate [3, 4] . Traditional molecular chaperones could be classified according to their molecular weights and sequences to families such as HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and nucleoplasmin. They have low specificity and react with many kinds of proteins. The low specificity of conventional molecular chaperones enables them to help many house-keeping proteins simultaneously. But a protein-misfolding disease might be caused by only one specie of protein which carries point mutants while most other housekeeping proteins are normal [5] . Thus the use of traditional molecular chaperones as therapeutic molecules for misfolding diseases may have problems such as low efficiency and undesired side-effects. A new field in development is to design or screen specific macromolecules which could be used as chaperones for target proteins, inhibiting their misfolding or coagulation to cure the related protein-misfolding diseases [6] [7] [8] . Antibodies are the most common macromolecules that can bind specifically to target proteins. Previous researches had shown that some antibodies could excert a chaperone-like function on their antigens [9] .",

According to existing researches in the folding of HCK, the dysfunction of HCK could be a highly possible pathogenic factor of many serious diseases [11, 12] . Our previous studies [13] indicate that HCK expressed in E. coli existed as inclusion bodies. Antibodies produced by using HCK expressed by E. coli as antigen could be used to study the renaturation of inclusion bodies, such as capturing the intermediates during the folding process of HCK to study the structural characteristics of the intermediates. An scFv is a fragment of a conventional antibody which is constructed by connecting the variable domains of the antibody heavy chain and the light chain by a segment of linker peptide. ScFvs with high affinity and specificity to their antigens had been isolated from phage display libraries by many groups [14] [15] [16] [17] . Schlattner [18] have successfully isolated several scFv clones from a human antibody phage display library that recognize cytosolic BB-CK.",

The number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein interactions was so large that no docking program nowadays can search the conformational space thoroughly even at the classical mechanics level of theory. Therefore, no current software is able to correctly dock two proteins ab initio.

Many bioinformatics software tools had been developed to predict epitopes. B-cell epitopes typically belong to one of the two classes: linear (continuous) epitopes or conformational (discontinuous) epitopes. At present the prediction methods for linear epitopes had been extensively studied and the prediction accuracy had been improved to be as high as 73.37% [26] . Thus linear epitopes prediction programs could be used to predict the potential binding sites of HCK. One technique recently developed to screen potential linear epitopes was the peptide array membrane technique [27] . Peptide fragments covering the whole sequence of a protein antigen were synthesized and spotted on the membrane, the membrane was then treated with antibodies. After washing away the unbound antibodies and labeling the bound antibodies with secondary chromogenic antibodies, the peptide segments of potential epitopes could be identified. Such identified peptides were only potential epitopes because when they were fixed on the membrane their conformation might not be the same as when they were parts of a protein. But we expected more reliable results could be deduced by combining the two methods.",

The chaperone-like function of the antibody was explained by investigating their interactions. The steps of this research were summarized as below. First, the three-dimensional structure of scFv-A4 was constructed by the homology modeling method. Then potential epitopes of HCK were predicted by software tools and the peptide array membrane experiment. The 3D models of scFv-A4-HCK complex were built by orientational docking. Finally, we analyzed the interaction between HCK and scFv-A4 and speculated the mechanism underlying the chaperone-like function of the scFv-A4.

The model of the antibody was constructed by the Modeller 9v7 program as shown in Figure 2a . The distributions of W-Y dihedral angles of the backbone were checked by the Procheck program [28] . A Ramachandran map was used to describe the dihedral angles of the low-energy conformation ( Figure 2b ). It showed that 87.4% of the residues fell into the best area, 12.1% of the residues into the other license area, 0.5% of the residues into the permitted area, 0.0% of the residues into the not allowed area. Therefore, dihedral angles of the structure of the model were reasonable. For 87.65% residues the 3D-1D compatibility score is greater than 0.2 by Verify-3D [29] (A high score indicated the compatibility of the sequence and the tertiary structure is good). The amino acids with scores less than 0.2 were GLY112-LYS142 which belonged to the linker segment ( Figure 2c ). Since no template was used for modeling the linker the poorer model result of this area was expected. The above evaluations verified that the three-dimensional model of scFv-A4 was reasonable.",

ZDOCK did not generate any reasonable models for four of the six peptides (SER129-LYS138, GLU248-LEU257, THR313-THR322, ASN5-TYR14). It was interesting because it agreed with the bioinformatics prediction that they were not epitopes. To look into the details of the six peptides, we investigated their structure feature. As shown in Figure 4 , the first three peptides were embedded inside the HCK monomers, thus they were not accessible by scFv-A4. For peptide ASN5-TYR14, it was buried between the dimerization interfaces of the two HCK monomers therefore it was also inaccessible for scFv-A4.

More researches need to be done to elucidate the mechanism of antibodies' chaperone-like function. A protein antigen usually carries more than one epitope, therefore an antigen can interact with several different types of antibodies. Obviously the different types of antibodies have different impacts on the antigen's properties. We had previously screened out several scFvs for HCK and one of them named scFv-A4 showed strong chaperone-like activity.

The prediction of protein-protein interactions by computer is still a challenging subject, and it is inappropriate to rely entirely on the energy scoring function to filter the results directly. Thus, we used the orientational docking method followed by redocking, the cumulated results were then sorted by the scoring function to get reliable protein-protein binding models. First the binding sites of the antigen and the antibody were predicted respectively. After that the two proteins were orientationally docked according to the predicted binding sites. Sequence based epitope prediction was still difficult especially for the conformational epitopes. We combined the prediction results of two different software tools, and only those epitopes reported by both methods were considered as potential epitopes. The accuracy of each method was 73% (FBCPred) and 84% (Ellipro) respectively, so the accuracy of the prediction of the two methods combined could reach 95%. The number of predicted epitopes was further reduced by comparing them with the peptide array membrane experiment results. The epitopes we studied were linear epitopes, and for linear peptide epitopes, the binding solely depends on amino acid sequences. If an antibody could bind to a linear peptide epitope, it will bind to the peptide irrespective of whether the peptide was on the protein, on the folding intermediate or on the membrane. Consequently only the epitopes which were positive in peptide array membrane experiment were selected for further modeling. Two antigenantibody model complexes were screened out as the final result.",

            "text": "There are two major entry points for scFv-A4 to exert its chaperone-like function on HCK, on the HCK folding intermediate or on the folded HCK. Yan et al found that the C-terminal domain of HCK was more likely to be the binding site during rabbit muscle CK (RMCK) aggregation [33] and the linker played a crucial role in RMCK folding [34, 35] . After further investigate, they found that the linker act as a lid to protect the hydrophobic side chains of PHE250 and VAL347 against exposure to solvent [36] . In complex model-I, scFv-A4 bound to the opposite site of HCK thus has not impact on these residues (Figure 5a ). In complex model-II, the binding position of scFV-A4 was close to the two hydrophobic residues and actually formed a bulky protrusion (Figure 5b) , therefore for complex model-II, scFv-A4 bound to HCK would hinder the aggregation of HCK by steric effects.Webb [37] found that the C-terminal portion of the chick CK (GLY215 to LYS380) was much more resistant to digestion than the N-terminal portion (PRO1 to GLY133), and the middle of the HCK sequence (ARG134 to ARG214) was most sensitive to proteolysis. They proposed that the folding intermediate consisted of a folded C-terminal domain and a partially folded N-terminal domain separated by an unfolded central linker. Gross et al.'s studies suggested that the C-terminal fragment (168-380) of mitochondrial CK represented an autonomous folding unit, and that the folding of the C-terminal domain might precede the conformational stabilization of the N-terminal moiety in vivo [38] . The binding site of complex model-I was located between these two terminal domains, which indicated that in complex model-I, scFv-A4 would not significantly interfere with the major folding path ways of the two domains. It may stabilize the folded C-terminal domain and assist in the folding of the Nterminal domain. There was a V8 endoproteinase sensitive fragment in the chick CK intermediate. When the chick CK had been resurrected, this fragment resisted to the proteinase, since it became less exposed in the folded kinase [39] . Therefore, this fragment can be regarded as a characteristic part of the creatine kinase intermediate. This fragment identified by V8 endoproteinase was IFKKAG [37] , the corresponding sequence of HCK was ILE263-GLY268. It is interesting that in complex model-II, scFv-A4 also bound to this segment which indicated that scFv-A4 could bind with the intermediate and participate in HCK folding or resurrecting process. To summarize, in complex model-II scFv-A4 can exhibit a chaperone-like function either by hindering the aggregation by the steric effects or by assisting the folding of HCK and stabilizing the folded conformation. In complex model-I, scFv-A4 exhibits chaperone-like function by assisting the folding of HCK and stabilizing the whole structure. In this study we combined computer modeling and the peptide array membrane method to investigate the interaction between scFv-A4 and HCK. The mechanisms underlying scFv-A4's chaperone-like function were discussed. The traditional method of studying antigen-antibody interactions is by constructing many antigen mutants and observing the changes of the binding activity. The whole process is tedious and time consuming. Epitopescanning by Peptide array membrane method has been made cheap and fast nowadays, our work demonstrated that the combination of the peptide array membrane technique with bioinfomatics methods could be a more efficient approach for epitope mapping. For the two complex models we proposed, further study can be done to verify the models by engineering point mutants on the predicted epitopes of HCK and investigating the change of the system's behaviors.",

A scFv sequence (ID: ACZ28696.1) [40] which had the highest score and the lowest E value was picked out to be used as reference. The sequences of ACZ28696.1 and scFv-A4 were aligned by Clustalx1.81 [41] and each area of the scFv-A4 sequence was appointed by comparing the sequence with ACZ28696.1. (2) Homology modeling templates preparation. Since linker peptides of the single chain antibody were often absent in the PDB database [42] , the sequence of the linker peptide would be excluded when aligned with the template antibody. The sequence of scFv-A4 without linker was used to search the PDB database. The light chain and the heavy chain were processed separately. We obtained a template (2DD8 [43] ) with a higher identity which was a Fab antibody fragment. The sequence identity of the light chain of the Fab was 100%, while that of the heavy chain was 93%. Both chains of the Fab were used as templates for building the 3D model of scFv-A4 by Modeller 9v7 [44] . (3) Optimization of the model. Since the linker was modeled without an appropriate template, optimization work was focused on the linker. The DOPE-based loop modeling protocol [44] was used to optimize the linker structure.",
