However, its function in the regulation of antiviral innate immune signaling pathway remains unclear. Here we reported a novel role of IFI204 that specifically inhibits the IRF7mediated type I interferons response during viral infection. IFI204 and other p200 family proteins are highly expressed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. The abundant IFI204 could significantly interact with IRF7 in nucleus by its HIN domain and prevent the binding of IRF7 with its corresponding promoter. Moreover, other p200 family proteins that possess HIN domain could also inhibit the IRF7-mediated type I interferons. These results reveal that, besides the positive regulation function in type I interferon response at the early stage of DNA virus infection, the interferon-inducible p200 family proteins such as IFI204 could also negatively regulate the IRF7-mediated type I interferon response after RNA virus infection to avoid unnecessary host damage from hyperinflammatory responses.",

The precise regulation mechanisms of the innate immune signaling pathway are still worth studying. Here, we found a novel role of the interferon-inducible p200 family protein IFI204 that specifically inhibits the IRF7-mediated type I interferon production by negative control of the transcriptional activity of IRF7 in the nucleus at the late stage of RNA virus infection. Previous studies showed that IFI204 is involved in DNA sensing during DNA virus infection to initiate antiviral immune responses. We demonstrate that IFI204 can inhibit IRF7-mediated activation of type I IFN responses induced by RNA virus infection, which is in contrast with its role in IRF3 activation in cGAS-PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.",

RLRs, including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, mainly recognize viral dsRNA or ssRNA, and ultimately lead to MAVS-IRF3-mediated transcription of target genes and the production of type I IFNs [7] [8] [9] . There are more than ten TLRs, three of which can recognize viral RNAs in endosome [10] [11] [12] [13] . TLR3 recognizes dsRNA and recruits the adaptor molecule TRIF to promote IRF3/7 import into the nucleus to activate the expression of type I IFNs and ISGs [14, 15] ; TLR7/8 detect ssRNA and recruit the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primaryresponse protein 88 (MyD88) to activate IRF7 to trigger the expression of type I IFNs [16, 17] . Both of the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and ALRs, including AIM2, IFI16 and IFI204, can activate the STING-IRF3 signaling pathway to induce the type I IFNs [4, [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Among the p200 family proteins, IFI16, AIM2 and MNDA are from humans, and IFI204, IFI205, IFI209, AIM2, MNDA and MNDAL are from mice. In addition to their functions in DNA sensing pathways [21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , the p200 family proteins can also act as modulators of many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair [23, 31] . In addition, IFI16 has been identified as an ISG that triggers proinflammatory mediators and therefore plays an important role in autoimmune diseases [26, 32] . However, Gray and colleagues have reported that ALRs including 13 PYHIN proteins are dispensable for interferon response to viral DNA in mice [33] . Therefore, the functions of p200 family proteins in antiviral responses need to be further clarified.",

Interestingly, we found that the IFI204 can specifically interact with IRF7 with its HIN domain and therefore hijack IRF7 in nucleus, consequently blocking the binding of IRF7 with its cognate transcriptional promoters. Moreover, other p200 family proteins that harbor a HIN domain could also bind with IRF7 and specifically down regulate the downstream transcription. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of negative regulation of type I IFNs response by p200 family proteins during RNA virus infection, which may prevent the host innate immune system from over-activation. This indicates that ALRs play two opposite roles during the infection of DNA and RNA viruses.",

            "text": "To identify the function of various cell factors induced by RNA virus infection, we adopted a BMDC infection model by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is typical RNA virus with positive single stranded RNA. As shown in Fig 1A, bone marrow cells were harvested from 8-week-old mice (C57BL/6) and induced with GM-CSF for 7-8 days. BMDCs were infected by MHV and collected at 18 hours (hrs) post infection (hpi). The differential expression level of host factors was measured by analyzing the transcriptome and proteome before and after MHV infection. We found that over 1000 genes at mRNA level and 200 at protein level were changed, among which 100 cellular factors were up-regulated or down-regulated both at mRNA and protein levels ( Fig 1A) . In this model, the transcription of Ifnb, Ifna1, Ifna4, Ifna6, Tnf and Il6 were significantly activated (S1 Fig), indicating that the IFN response and proinflammatory cytokines were apparently induced. Notably, the p200 family proteins, including IFI204, IFI205, IFI209 and MNDA were expressed at higher level after MHV infection ( Fig  1A) . Interestingly, IFI204, which is previously reported to initiate type I IFNs in DNA virusinfected cells, obtained high scores as up-regulated factor both at mRNA and protein levels ( Fig 1B) . Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed that the MHV infection induced a 5-fold upregulation of the mRNA of Ifi204 at 18 hpi ( Fig 1B) . Moreover, the transcriptional regulation of Ifi204 is consistent with viral growth curve in MHV-infected BMDCs ( Fig 1C) . However, Ifi204 was not stimulated in IFN-associated receptor-deficient (Ifnar -/-) BMDCs (Fig 1D) , indicating that the upregulation is interferon-dependent. Furthermore, the similar phenomena were observed in wt BMDCs and Ifnar -/-BMDCs infected by a DNA virus (HSV-1) (S2 Fig). These data indicate that the expression of IFI204 is induced by type I IFNs during the infections of DNA or RNA viruses.",

To further clarify the function of IFI204 during the infection of DNA virus, we infected NIH3T3 cells with HSV-1. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that knockdown of IFI204 and double knockdown of IFI204-STING or IFI204-cGAS significantly inhibited HSV-1-induced transcription of Ifnb to different degrees in NIH3T3 cells (S5A Fig) . Moreover, we also observed consistent phenomena in HSV-1-infected A549 cells with IFI16 -/-, IFI16 -/-STING knockdown or IFI16 -/-cGAS knockdown (S5B Fig), indicating that IFI204 might facilitate cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway that leads to IRF3 activation during the infection of HSV-1. These data collectively suggest that IFI204 inhibits RNA virus-triggered type I IFNs, while promotes DNA virus-triggered type I IFNs. ",

            "text": "As is known, RNA viruses trigger IRF3-and IRF7-mediated activation of type I IFNs, while DNA viruses activate STING-IRF3 signaling pathway [24] . In our MHV-induced BMDCs model, a set of host factors in both IRF3 and IRF7 signaling pathway were stimulated (S6 Fig) . Therefore, to find out which signaling pathway is inhibited by IFI204, IRF3 or IRF7 were cotransfected with IFI204 into Irf3 \u2212/\u2212 Irf7 \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which were infected by HSV-1 or SeV as the model of DNA or RNA virus, respectively. As shown in Fig 3A, in IRF3-transfected Irf3 \u2212/\u2212 Irf7 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs, the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 could be activated by either HSV-1 or SeV infection. However, IFI204 can only enhance the transcription of Ifnb induced by the infection of HSV-1 in the presence of IRF3 as previously reported. In contrast, in IRF7-transfected Irf3 \u2212/\u2212 Irf7 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs, the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 could only be activated by SeV infection or by the self-activating IRF7 mutant IRF7-\u0394247-467 [36] ( Fig 3A) . Intriguingly, IFI204 significantly inhibited the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 in SeV-infected IRF7-rescuing MEFs or IRF7-\u0394247-467-rescuing MEFs (Fig 3A) . In addition, the ELISA analysis showed that the production of IFN\u03b1 was also remarkably inhibited by IFI204 in SeV-infected IRF7-transfected Irf3 \u2212/\u2212 Irf7 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( Fig 3B) . Consistent with Fig 3A, the infection of HSV-1 could not effectively induce the expression of IFN\u03b1 in IRF7-rescuing MEFs. However, IFI204 could still inhibit the expression of IFN\u03b1 induced by the self-activating IRF7-\u0394247-467 mutant in the context of HSV-1 infection (Fig 3B) . To confirm the above observed results, we further evaluated the transcriptional activation of Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters through more sensitive luciferase assay in Irf3 \u2212/\u2212 Irf7 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs. As shown in Fig 3C, IFI204 inhibited the transcriptional activation of Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters in SeV-infected IRF7-rescuing and IRF7-\u0394247-467-rescuing MEFs but not IRF3-rescuing MEFs. Furthermore, IFI204 could repress the transcriptional activation of Ifna4 promoters induced by overexpression of IRF7 with or without SeV-infection in HEK293T cells (Fig 3D) , indicating that the inhibition takes place at the downstream of IRF7 activation. Together, these results indicate that IFI204 can significantly inhibit IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses, and this inhibition event only occurs in RNA virus-infected cells, which could effectively induce the IRF7-mediated signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Because the IFI204 and IRF7 were co-localized in the nucleus of RNA virus-infected cells, we hypothesized that IFI204 would hijack the imported IRF7, leading to suppression of the downstream transcription. The nucleo-cytoplasmic separation analysis revealed that knockdown of IFI204 could remarkably reduce the phosphorylation level of IRF7 and decrease the amount of nuclear IRF7 in SeV-, poly(I:C)-or ssPolyU-induced NIH3T3 cells (Fig 5A and 5B ). Confocal fluorescence microscopy also confirmed this observation, indicating that IFI204 could interact with IRF7 and increase the amount of nuclear IRF7 ( Fig 5C) . These results suggest that negative regulation of IRF7-mediated IFN responses by IFI204 was not due to the inhibition of the phosphorylation and nuclear import of IRF7, but due to blocking a downstream step, such as DNA-binding. Therefore, we adopted the CHIP and EMSA analysis to investigate the binding efficiency of IRF7 and its cognate promoter DNA. As shown in Fig 6, the CHIP analysis demonstrated that IFI204 remarkably inhibits the binding of IRF7 and its promoter DNA. In contrast, the IFI204 mutant (IFI204-\u0394225-239) had significantly less inhibition on the binding of IRF7 with its specific promoter DNA ( Fig 6A) . The EMSA analysis showed that the IRF7 could bind to PRDI region on the promoter of IFN-\u03b2 gene as previously reported [36] , while IFI204 could not bind with the IRF7-specific promoter ( Fig 6B) . This result excludes the possibility that IFI204 directly binds to PRDI promoter to inhibit its transcription. As shown in Fig 6C, the binding of IRF7 and PRDI was remarkably attenuated by the IFI204 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 6C) . Together, the results indicate that the interaction of IFI204 and IRF7 prevents IRF7 from binding to IRF7-specific promoter DNA.",

Nuclear lysates were tested by western blotting using anti-IRF7 and anti-lamin b1 antibodies. Levels of IRF7 was quantified by densitometry and normalized to lamin b1 protein levels. (C) Intracellular localization of endogenous IRF7 assessed by immunostaining followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (left panel). NIH3T3 cells infected by lentivirus-mediated shIFI204 (NIH3T3-shIFI204) or shNC (NIH3T3-WT) were infected with SeV for 12 hrs. Then cells were washed with PBS and harvested for immunofluorescence analysis. Rabbit anti-IRF7 antibody was used as primary antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect IRF7 as shown in green fluorescence. DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is used for nuclei staining as shown in blue fluorescence. The white arrow indicates the different protein levels of IRF7 in perinuclear region. Relative level of IRF7 in the nucleus was quantified by densitometry (right panel). \ufffd P < 0.05, \ufffd\ufffd P < 0.01 and \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd P < 0.001. Data are representative of two independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD in A-C).",

            "text": "IFI204/IFI16, known as ALRs and expressed constitutively in host cells, are involved in the sensing of intracellular DNA derived from pathogens and subsequent induction of the production of type I IFNs as well as proinflammatory mediators via STING-IRF3 pathway [19, 24] . However, Gray and colleagues demonstrated that ALRs, including IFI204, are dispensable for the interferon response to intracellular DNA in mice with knockout of all PYHIN proteins [33] . Two later studies reported that IFI16 cooperates with cGAS-STING pathway to promote the type I IFNs during the DNA virus infection [28, 29] . In this study, we showed that IFI204 could promote the expression of IFN\u03b2 via IRF3-mediated signaling pathway (S5 Fig and Fig 3) but down regulate the IRF7-mediated IFN response. Why inconsistent results were obtained from different studies is still one unanswered question. We propose that PYHIN proteins may not be essential in DNA sensing (as shown by Gray et al.) but involved in the regulation of interferon responses (as shown in this study and by different laboratories). The regulatory function of p200 family members may involve more than one PYHIN protein, and when all PYHIN proteins are knocked out, such regulation could not be observed and, instead, the regulation of interferon response is compensated by other regulation system. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy may be due to the use of different inducers (or viruses) and cell types. More studies are needed to clarify these issues in the future but they are already beyond the range of current work, which focuses to reveal the negative regulatory function of p200 family proteins in IRF7-mediated type I IFN responses (Figs 2, 3 and 7) . P200 family proteins are IFN-inducible proteins, belonging to the category of ISGs [37] . Many ISGs were reported to positively regulate the IFN responses. However, only a few ISGs are known to negatively regulate type I IFN responses and proinflammatory mediators. Here, we demonstrated that the IFI204 and several other p200 family proteins were highly induced in both DNA and RNA virus infection (Fig 1 and S2 Fig) . Intriguingly, IFI204 specifically inhibits the IRF7-mediated type I IFNs response in RNA virus infection (Figs 2, 3 and 7) . The infection of DNA virus HSV-1 could not effectively stimulate the IRF7-mediated signaling pathway as shown in Fig 3 and in previous studies [19, 24] . However, in the absence of IRF3, IFI204 could still inhibit type I IFN responses initiated by the self-activating IRF7-\u0394247-467 mutant in the context of HSV-1 infection (Fig 3B and 3A) . Such results suggest a specific function of IFI204 in suppression of IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses in whatever way IRF7 is activated.",

However, the whole signaling pathway should be tightly regulated to avoid overproduction of IFNs and inflammatory factors that can cause tissue damage and even autoimmune diseases [38] . For example, the acute coronaviral infection such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and overdosed IFN\u03b1 in antiviral treatment can cause tissue damage due to the hyper-inflammatory responses [39] . Here we use MHV that belongs to the same genus betacoronavirus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to mimic the acute RNA virus infection. In our MHV-infected BMDC model, both IRF3-and IRF7-mediated pathways of type I IFNs and some subsequent proinflammatory mediators were stimulated (Figs 1 and 3, S1 and S6 Figs) . Notably, IRF7-mediated pathway of type I IFN responses is mainly initiated by ssRNA sensor TLR7, and previous studies reported that the over-expression or activation of TLR7 is associated with autoimmune diseases [40] [41] [42] . The over-expression and activation of TLR7 as well as the stimulation of IFN\u03b1 were also observed in our MHV-infection BMDCs model (Figs 2 and 3, S6 Fig) , which is consistent with clinical symptoms. Our current study revealed a novel negative regulation mechanism in the RNA virusinduced IRF7-mediated IFN responses.",

(B) qRT-PCR analysis of Ifnb, Ifna4, Ifit1 and ELISA analysis of IFN\u03b1 in NIH3T3 cells transfected with si-Ifi205 and siNC as negative control. The cells were unstimulated (US) or stimulated by SeV or poly(I:C) for 8 hrs as indicated. \ufffd P < 0.05, \ufffd\ufffd P < 0.01 and \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd P < 0.001. Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD in A and B). (TIF) S1",
