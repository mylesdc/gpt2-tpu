Specifically, the DSN Initiative aimed to build individual and institutional capacity to conduct disease surveillance and response efficiently and effectively; build bridges between disease surveillance networks and international agencies to increase the effectiveness of global response systems; and strengthen connections between animal health, human health, and environmental health through a ''One Health'' approach.",

Outcome 2: Capacity: Disease surveillance practitioners and their institutions strengthen, apply, and distribute technical and communication skills in disease surveillance to more effectively address disease threats. Outcome 3: Tools: Disease surveillance practitioners have access to \u00c1 and use \u00c1improved tools and methods to effectively and efficiently monitor, share and report information; and respond to disease threats. Outcome 4: Transdisciplinary Leadership in One Health: Policy makers, human health and veterinary practitioners take a trans-disciplinary approach to policy and practice in animal and human health while emphasizing ''One Health'' principles at global, regional and local levels. In commissioning the independent evaluation, the Foundation was interested in knowing whether the Foundation's work in disease surveillance was relevant to current global and regional trends and challenges in disease surveillance; whether it was efficiently and effectively used to improve skills and capacity for early detection and response; whether it was helpful to containing infectious disease outbreaks, thereby saving lives and livelihoods; and whether it is sustainable in the longer term.",

Field visit and interview data indicate that networks supported by the Rockefeller Foundation DSN Initiative work have demonstrated effectiveness in reporting and containing outbreaks such as dengue, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and influenza. Stakeholders on every level validated the relevance and utility of the networked approach to disease surveillance. The regional network structure is seen as one that promotes the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices and thereby improves country-level efficiency in adopting effective surveillance and response systems. Network structures are also seen as a way of distributing capacity and assuring timely access to technical capacity in resource poor settings. Finally, they are seen as a way to build deeper and more extensive global, regional, and local ties between disease surveillance organizations and countries. These ties not only increase access to knowledge sharing, but they also create new pathways for the flow of critical information. Major factors driving the success of regional DSNs in Asia and Africa include: trust; transparency; a cooperative spirit; and partners with a sustained vision of a strong informal network. Government ownership, leadership and political will are also essential for success.",

Specifically, the Initiative supported the provision and, with local partners, development of training, thought leadership, curricula, tools, technical support, and forums for learning, sharing, and developing knowledge and best practices. Additionally, Initiative support has facilitated substantial interaction not only among different networks, but also among different sectors (e.g., animal and human health, livestock, agriculture, transportation, security, immigration). For example, MBDS is cited by network participants, peers, and partners as being fundamental in promoting the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices to improve the Mekong countries' surveillance and response systems.

The Initiative has ensured its continued relevance at both regional and global levels not only by being an early adopter of the One Health perspective, but also by listening to its partners and network members, shifting its focus over time in response to changing needs and trends in human/animal health, and embracing the growing need for health diplomacy.",

Second, Foundation information systems were unable to provide timely and complete information on grantee outputs. Third, efficiency and sustainability would be enhanced by coordination with other large funders and partners. For example, the simultaneous growth of networks such as WHO's Global Outreach Alert and Response Network, the Global Laboratories Directory and Network, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were not planned to interoperate with the DSN grantees, limiting opportunities to efficiently work and grow together. Fourth, a formal exit strategy to guide the Foundation when concluding the work of the Initiative was not put into place early enough.
