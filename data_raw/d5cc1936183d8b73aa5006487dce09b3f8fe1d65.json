            "text": "White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the most devastating virosis threatening the shrimp culture industry worldwide. Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp with a certain amount of WSSV cultured at 18uC and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25uC. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn't suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies.",

The causative agent, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), is an enveloped virus with a circular double strand DNA of about 300 kb, belonging to a new virus family Nimaviridae [2, 3] . The virus mainly infects animals of Decapoda and causes high lethality to shrimp [4] . Its outbreak depends on the interactions among the pathogen, host and environment. The interaction between WSSV and the hosts has been a research focus in recent years. Many host membrane proteins such as Rab7, b-integrin and chitin-binding protein showed interactions with WSSV envelope proteins in vitro and were proposed as possible WSSV receptors [5] [6] [7] . Shrimp STAT, Relish and Dorsal were annexed by WSSV to enhance viral immediate-early genes [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, these studies are far from enough to illustrate the mechanisms of WSSV pathogenesis.",

GO analysis of the DEGs related to positive regulation of cell death and anti-apoptosis. glycometabolism (File S5). Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase which were involved in glycosis, were all up-regulated in Group WT, suggesting that the glycosis was enhanced (Table 4 ). Pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme were downregulated in Group WT, suggesting that a reduced glycometabolism level through the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway (TCA) ( Table 4 ). However the isocitrate dehydrogenase with NADP as the coenzyme was up-regulated in Group WT, which may be the compensatory expression for the inhibited expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme. The expression profiles of ATP-citrate synthase (CL4068.Contig2_All) and triosephosphate isomerase B (Unigene3409_All) in the three groups were analyzed by real-time PCR to check whether the changes in glycometabolism were caused by temperature variation or WSSV proliferation (Fig. 3) . The expression of ATP-citrate synthase showed no significant difference between Group T and Group W at 12 hptr (P.0.05), but its expression in Group WT at the same time was significantly lower than those in Group T and Group W. As for triosephosphate isomerase B, its expression in Group WT was remarkably higher than those in Group W and Group T (P,0.05) at both 12 hptr and 24 hptr. These data suggested that the TCA pathway was possibly weakened and the glycosis was enhanced due to the rapid replication of WSSV. It was reported that the normal flux in TCA cycle was disrupted by the infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) in shrimp at least temporally and it was reckoned that the interruption of the Krebs cycle may favor the inducement of a higher lipogenic and cholesterogenic activity, which may ultimately be essential for the virus replication [30] . Metabolic changes resembling the Warburg effect in shrimp hemocytes were detected in the early stage of WSSV infection and it was proposed that the enhanced aerobic glycosis and ATP energy production favored the virus during the earlier phases of its replication cycle [31] .",

GO analysis showed that DEGs related to positive regulation of cell death were down-regulated and DEGs related to anti-apoptosis were up-regulated in Group WT, implying that the virus inhibited the host cell death to benefit its own propagation (Table 5 ). Apoptosis has been regarded as a nonspecific defense mechanism against virus infection in eukaryotic cells, aborting virus multiplication by a premature lysis of infected cells [32] [33] [34] . Viruses have evolved various strategies to escape apoptosis of the host through viral antiapoptosis genes to guarantee the production of enough viral progeny [35, 36] . Apoptotic-related proteins showed a high expression level in the virus resistant shrimp, suggesting that apoptosis might play important roles in shrimp immunity against WSSV infection [37, 38] . The enhancement of apoptotic activity effectively inhibited the WSSV infection in shrimp, resulting in decreased shrimp mortality, while apoptosis inhibitor increased the mortality of shrimp infected by WSSV [39] . WSSV showed the ability to modulate apoptosis of shrimp cell. Two WSSV antiapoptosis proteins AAP-1 and WSSV222 were identified [40] [41] [42] [43] . AAP-1 is a direct caspase inhibitor and WSSV222 functions through ubiquitin-mediated degradation and blocks apoptosis induced by the tumor suppressor-like protein [36] . In the present study, AAP-1 (Unigene30118_All) and WSSV222 (Unige-ne30290_All) were all remarkably up-regulated in Group WT at 12 hptr suggesting that they might be responsible for the inhibited apoptosis at the initial stage of WSSV acute replication. Most DEGs with annotation to E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (9/10, File S6) were down-regulated. Among them, two E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase genes (CL1901.Contig1_All and Unigene37574_All) were further confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 4) . Ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases were regarded as key regulators of cell death, which controlled many pro-and anti-apoptotic molecules at the protein level by Ub-dependent degradation or non-degradative ubiquity- Table 6 .

The cell cycle consists of four phases, gap 1 (G1), synthesis (S), gap 2 (G2) and mitosis (M) in succession. In order to carry through this vital process orderly, a series of mechanisms have been developed and cyclins are a family of controller proteins. In the present study, 10 DEGs were annotated as cyclins, which were all down-regulated (File S7). The expression profiles of two cyclin genes (Unigene42832_All and CL2571.Contig1_All) in the three groups were further confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 5 ). The expression of both genes in Group WT at 12 hpi was nearly completely repressed, compared with that in Group T and Group W. These data further indicated that the inhibition of host cell proliferation was caused by WSSV; and the arrested state started at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection and lasted until 24 hptr at least when shrimp death began to occur. Some viruses were reported to be able to arrest host cells at certain cell phases with different mechanisms [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Autographa californica Nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) arrested host cell at G2/M phase due to a virus-coded protein with cdc2associated kinase activity [46] . Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activated cell cycle inhibitor p21/ Waf1/Cip1, causing cellular arrest in G2/M phase [47] . Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induced a state of late G1 arrest and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection resulted in an arrest at the G0/G1 phase [45, 48] . It was reported that alterations in cell cycle transit during virus infection might be very important for the virulence difference between Malignant fibroma virus (MV) and Shope fibroma virus (SFV) [50] . This may be also one of the causes of the high virulence of WSSV. The molecular mechanisms underlying the alteration in cell cycle transit needs to be further clarified to find a target for controlling the WSSV disease.",

The expression profiles of Unigene83_All (a DNA primase), Unigene20038_All (a DNA polymerase) and CL2500.Contig1_All (a DNA topoisomerase) in the three groups at 6, 12 and 24 hptr were further detected by real-time PCR (Fig. 6) . The expression of these three genes in Group WT at 12 hptr was significantly lower than that in Group T and Group W at 12 hptr (P,0.05), indicating that their expression had been repressed due to the rapid replication of WSSV. And as for Unigene83_All and Unigene20038_All, the repressed state lasted till 24 hptr at least when shrimp death began to occur. All these data indicated that WSSV proliferation inhibited the cellular DNA replication process and WSSV may rely on its own polymerase and helicase for DNA replication. The adverse effect on the cellular DNA synthesis in the infection course of other viruses such as frog virus 3, herpes simplex virus, HCMV and AcMNPV were also reported and the repressed state of cellular DNA replication ensures that the virus will have unrivalled access to precursors of DNA synthesis [45, [51] [52] [53] . The decline of cellular DNA synthesis during the infection of frog virus 3 and herpes simplex virus might be caused by the infecting particles themselves and does not require the synthesis of new RNA or protein [51, 52] . The mechanisms of the repressed cellular DNA synthesis during WSSV infection still need further study.",

In the present study, DEGs annotated as actin binding or inhibiting protein and a DEG annotated as ADAM9 were all down-regulated at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection (File S9). ADMA9 were reported to be able to bind to integrin [55, 56] . Thus, these genes might compete with WSSV for the binding to actin or disintegrin. It was guessed that the down-regulation of these DEGs was possibly resulted from temperature rising and their down-regulation was responsible for the breakout of WSSV acute infection. Therefore, the expression profiles of two actin binding genes (Unigene7524_All, and Unigene42358_All) and the ADMA9 (Unigene37466_All) in the three groups at the sampling time were detected by real-time PCR to analyze whether the down-regulation of these genes was an inducement or a result of WSSV acute proliferation.",

It was supposed that the down-regulation of ADMA9 after temperature rising resulted in the release of WSSV receptor integrin, bringing about the acute proliferation of WSSV and the expression of ADMA9 was further completely interdicted for the need of more integrin receptors in WSSV acute infection.

When we detected the expression of Unigenes37705 by real-time PCR, we found that its expression was completely inhibited in Group WT at 12 hptr, the initial stage of WSSV acute infection. By contrast, it was significantly upregulated in Group W at 6 hptr and 12 hptr, when the shrimp of this group were still at the stage of latent infection (Fig. 9 ). Crustin is a widely distributed family of antimicrobial peptide within decapod of crustaceans and was regarded as an important component of the innate immune system [57] . Most reports about crustins focused on their anti-bacterial function and little is known about their interaction with virus. A significant down-regulation of the crustin-like AMP was noted post WSSV challenge in Penaeus monodon. After administrating immunostimulants, such as the marine yeast Candida haemulonii, the expression of crustin-like AMP was enhanced, and the shrimp showed increased viability against WSSV infection [58] . In Macrobrachium rosenbergii, which has much stronger resistance to WSSV than penaeid shrimp, the expression of crustin remained up-regulation during WSSV infection [59] . Together with this study, it could be indicated that crustin may function as a WSSV-resistant gene and was possibly a responsible factor for the slowed infection pace of Group W. The virulence of viruses is partially related to their ability to suppress the host anti-viral defense [29] , and the results demonstrated that WSSV is highly pathogenic.",

            "text": "It is also very interesting to note that HSP70, HSP90 and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) genes were all up-regulated in Group WT at 12 hptr (File S11). Heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) of shrimp was a binding partner of WSSV envelop protein VP28 during infection and their association was specific, ATPdependent and Hsc70 concentration dependent [60] . Hsp70 could inhibit WSSV replication at high temperature [20] . Thus the roles of these heat shock proteins during WSSV infection deserve much attention. The expression profile of one GRP78 gene (Unige-ne9162_All) was detected in the three groups at the sampling time ( Fig. 10) . At 6 hptr, the expression of GRP78 in GroupWT was significantly higher than that in Group T (P,0.05) and its high expression level in Group WT remained thereafter. This result was consistent with previous report that GRP78 kept a high expression level in hepatopancreas all through the WSSV infection course [61] . At 24 hptr, its expression in Group WT and Group W were all significantly higher than that in Group T (P,0.05). These results implied that the up-regulated expression of this GRP78 gene was due to WSSV infection. GRP78 functions not only in unfolded protein response and oxidative stress, but also in antiapoptosis process [62, 63] . The up-regulation of GRP78 was induced by the infection of many other viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus, HCMV, rotavirus and Dengue virus (DENV) [64] [65] [66] [67] . However it exhibits distinct functions in different virus infections. GRP78 acts as an endogenous antiviral factor against HBV [65] , whereas it could be annexed by other viruses to facilitate the infection. GRP78 may be utilized as a chaperone for viral-protein production by DENV, for virion release by HMCV and for infectious virion maturation by rotavirus [66] . The GRP78 was activated during WSSV infection but further study is needed to clarify whether it was involved in WSSV pathogenesis or in shrimp immunity against the virus.",

At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection after temperature rising from 18uC to 25uC, WSSV exploited the cellular machinery for the seek of its own proliferation and the shrimp went through a lot of biological changes as this study demonstrated. For more information about the inducing mechanisms of WSSV acute infection after temperature change, sampling had better be carried out earlier when the infection of Group WT was at the end of the latent stage and the virus hasn't undertaken rapid replication.
