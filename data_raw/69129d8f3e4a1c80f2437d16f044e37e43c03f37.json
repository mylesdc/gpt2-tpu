The innate immune system utilizes pattern-recognition receptors at cell surfaces, in endosomal compartments, and in the cytoplasm to detect immunostimulatory molecules and induce antimicrobial activities 2 . In the cytoplasm, RNA species are detected by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and cytosolic DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) 3, 4 . While signalling stimulated by RNA proceeds through a pathway dependent on the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signalling (MAVS) protein, DNA-stimulated signalling relies on stimulator of interferon genes (STING) 5 . Upon DNA recognition, cGAS produces 2'3' cGAMP, which binds STING to induce a conformational change. This allows activation of the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) (refs 6,7) , which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF3 leading to expression of type I interferons (interferon, interferon-a/-b) [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

STING-deficient murine embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit increased viral growth when infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and decreased interferon-b production in response to Sendai virus (SeV). The importance of STING in the innate immune defence against RNA viruses was further supported by the identification of RNA viruses that antagonize STING-dependent signalling [10] [11] [12] . In contrast to the well-documented role for STING in innate responses to DNA viruses, the basis for the involvement of STING in controlling RNA viruses has not been identified. Here we describe a cGAS-independent STING pathway triggered by enveloped RNA viruses to evoke innate immune responses and demonstrate that this pathway is targeted by influenza A virus (IAV).",

However, STING is also necessary for full responsiveness to-and control of-RNA viruses 9 . Work by us and others has recently proposed alternative and DNA-independent means for activating STING-dependent innate antiviral immune responses 14, 15 . In line with this, RNA viruses have been demonstrated to target the STING pathway [10] [11] [12] . In order to evaluate the role of STING in the stimulation of interferon production by RNA viruses, and to explore the potential involvement of cGAS, we infected wild-type (WT), STING-and cGAS-deficient MEFs with the two paramyxoviruses Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and SeV and measured the accumulation of type I interferon in the culture supernatant. Interestingly, lack of STING, but not cGAS, significantly reduced the production of type I interferons by cells infected with these viruses (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. 1a) . In contrast to this, the stimulation of interferon expression by synthetic RNA (poly(I:C)) was not affected in cells lacking STING or cGAS but was completely abolished in MAVS-deficient cells ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b) . To examine whether STING but not cGAS contributed to control of RNA viruses, we infected MEFs from WT, cGAS-and STING-deficient mice with the rhabdovirus VSV and measured accumulation of progeny virus in the supernatant. Consistent with the data on interferon production by RNA viruses, lack of STING but not cGAS led to elevated VSV replication (Fig. 1d) .",

CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to generate cells deficient for cGAS and STING or b2microglobulin (B2M) as control. The deletion of cGAS and STING was confirmed by western blotting ( Supplementary  Fig. 1c ). As expected, the loss of cGAS or STING abolished the ability to produce type I interferon in response to transfection with DNA, whereas dsRNA-induced type I interferon production was unaffected ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The cells were infected with IAV, and accumulation of interferon in the supernatant was measured after 20 h. Similar to what was observed with NDV and SeV in MEFs, we observed that IAV-induced interferon production was reduced in cells lacking STING expression, but not in cGAS-deficient THP1 cells (Fig. 1e) .",

Consistent with this, the majority of the interferon responses evoked by infection with NDV or SeV were dependent on MAVS ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) . However, we observed a significant residual response in MAVS-deficient cells infected with RNA viruses, which we did not observe when transfecting with synthetic RNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Fig. 1c) . The MAVS-independent nature of interferon responses was also observed for IAV, when measuring the ISG CXCL10 in BMDCs infected with high multiplicity of infection (MOI) ( Supplementary Fig. 2c ). To further explore whether RNA viruses induced a MAVS-independent but STING-dependent pathway, we examined for the ability of SeV, NDV and IAV to stimulate STING dimer formation in THP1 cells lacking MAVS, and therefore unable to respond to RNA ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, infection with either of the three RNA viruses induced elevated levels of STING dimers in the lysates (Fig. 1f) , and consistent with this, the residual induction of interferon-b and CXCL10 expression by IAV in MAVS-deficient cells was ablated when STING but not cGAS was knocked down by shRNA ( Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2d ). Poly(I:C) did not stimulate CXCL10 expression in MAVS-deficient cells (Fig. 1g) .

Interestingly, co-staining of cells with antibodies against the IAV surface protein hemagglutinin and STING revealed that hemagglutinin co-localized with a small pool of cellular STING (Fig. 1h) . The observed specks staining positive for both STING and hemagglutinin, was observed in the majority of cells with positive hemagglutinin staining. Among the STING-hemagglutinin double-positive specks, many were also positive for the early endosome antigen 1 ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , potentially suggesting the co-localization to occur in early endosomal compartments. Moreover, STING co-immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin in lysates from infected cells (Fig. 1i) . Hemagglutinin is involved in viral entry, and the N-terminal region of HA2, termed the fusion peptide (FP), penetrates the cellular membrane during fusion 18 . FP is highly conserved among IAV strains and also in influenza B virus 18, 19 (Fig. 1j) , and was recently shown to have immunosuppressive properties in a monocytic cell line 20 .

By contrast, FP largely abrogated type I interferon production induced by fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 2c,d) , without affecting fusion between liposomes and cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a ). Furthermore, as we have also demonstrated previously 14 , fusogenic liposomes stimulated STING speck formation ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) , and as observed with IAV the production of type I interferon stimulated by fusogenic liposomes was STING-dependent but cGAS-independent ( Fig. 2e ,f). FP did not affect the MAVS-dependent response to synthetic RNA, as the response to transfection with poly(I:C) was unchanged (Fig. 2g,h) . Moreover, by introducing a single aminoacid deletion to FP (FPDI6) the ability to block type I interferon production was abrogated ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Thus, IAV FP specifically inhibits the cGAS-independent STING pathway induced by lipid membrane fusion but does not affect interferon induction by cytosolic delivery of synthetic DNA, cGAMP or RNA.",

Stimulation through the cGAS-STING pathway is reported to initiate and depend on relocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi 5 . Similar to DNA stimulation, treatment with fusogenic liposomes triggered translocation of STING to the Golgi (Fig. 3a) , and Brefeldin A inhibited interferon-b expression in response to either fusogenic liposomes or DNA ( Supplementary Fig. 5a) , thus supporting the importance of STING translocation from ER to the Golgi. Treatment with FP did not interfere with translocation of STING from ER to the Golgi (Fig. 3a) . STING forms covalent homodimers in response to stimulation with cyclic di-nucleotides, and dimerization of STING is sufficient for induction of type I interferon 21 . When examining for STING dimer formation using non-reducing gels, we found that treatment with fusogenic liposomes induced the formation of a reducible STING dimer ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Interestingly, FP pretreatment abolished STING dimerization, subsequent TBK1 phosphorylation and IRF-dependent transcription in response to fusogenic liposomes ( Fig. 3b-d) but not in response to cGAMP irrespective of delivery method (Fig. 3e ,f and Supplementary  Fig. 6b ). These data demonstrate that stimulation of STINGdependent pathways results in formation of stable STING homodimers and phosphorylation of TBK1, and that the IAV FP specifically inhibits this in response to fusogenic liposomes.",

By contrast, expression of WT but not R168A restored responsiveness to fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 5f ). The opposite was observed when we tested STING-deficient cells reconstituted with R231A ( Supplementary  Fig. 7) , which like R232 in human STING is essential for responsiveness to cyclic-di-nucleotides 22 . Thus, the fusion-STING and the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathways can be functionally separated by the two mutants tested, and the R168A mutant provided a tool that enabled us to functionally study the fusion-STING pathway. Interestingly, when infected with VSV, production of progeny virus was reduced B10-fold in cells expressing WT STING compared with R168A and eGFPexpressing cells (Fig. 5g) . Moreover, type I interferon production in response to NDV was augmented by expression of WT but not R168A STING (Fig. 5h) . VSV and NDV are both enveloped viruses. To determine whether R168A was also important for control of a naked RNA virus, we evaluated replication and interferon-b mRNA expression during infection with the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus in these cell lines. Interestingly, expression of neither WT nor R168A STING affected the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus (Fig. 5i) , and the modest induction of interferon-b expression was independent of STING ( Fig. 5j) . Finally, we wanted to examine whether the IAV FP could antagonize the STING-dependent antiviral response against VSV. STING-deficient MEFs transduced with eGFP or WT STING were treated with vehicle or FP during infection. Interestingly, treatment with FP led to elevated viral replication in cells expressing STING but not in cells lacking STING expression (Fig. 5k) . Collectively, these data show that sensing of lipid membrane fusion contributes to the antiviral response against enveloped RNA viruses and identifies the IAV FP as a viral strategy to counteract this defence mechanism.",

For RNA viruses, it is known that RIG-I and MDA5 detect viral genomic material to stimulate signalling via MAVS to the TBK1-IRF3-interferon pathway 13 . However, after infections at higher MOI, residual RLR-MAVS-independent interferon production has been observed [25] [26] [27] . Moreover, full protection against RNA viruses also relies on STING 9 , and many RNA viruses have developed mechanisms to block STING-dependent signalling [10] [11] [12] . Despite this, there is no knowledge on the nature of STING-dependent pathway that is important for innate responses to RNA viruses [10] [11] [12] . Here we identify a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent pathway, which is stimulated by lipid membrane fusion, and is important for type I interferon expression in response to enveloped RNA viruses, including IAV.

In contrast, DNA stimulates the same response through a pathway dependent on both cGAS and STING. These data suggest that the process of virus-cell membrane fusion is responsible for stimulation of STING-dependent signalling by enveloped RNA viruses. We previously reported that herpes simplex virus-like particles induce low-grade interferon-b expression through fusion with the cell plasma membrane 14 , and the present data suggests that this mechanism is involved in mounting antiviral responses against enveloped but not naked RNA viruses. It still remains unresolved how the fusion of viral membranes with the cell is detected to initiate signalling.",

To this end, our identification of Arg168 (Arg169 in human STING) as being important for stimulation of interferon expression by liposomes but not cGAMP, demonstrates that activation by these two stimuli can be mechanistically separated. Importantly, the STING R168A mutant exhibited impaired ability to evoke full interferon and antiviral responses during infection with RNA viruses. Arg168 is located just outside the STING dimerization surface, is facing away from the cGAMP-binding pocket and is surface exposed 4,6,7 . Therefore, it is possible that this positively charged and highly conserved residue is involved in protein-protein interactions with yet unknown partner(s), which are recruited upon membrane fusion and are involved in stimulating STING-dependent signalling. With respect to the existence of mechanisms of STING activation independent of DNA stimulation and cGAMP engagement, patients with gain-offunctions mutations in STING and constitutive activation of the pathway were recently reported 28 .",

This suggests that the pathway is of importance for defence against IAV infections. hemagglutinin is essential for the fusion of IAV with the host cell, and FP is engaged in the membranous region during fusion 18 . We found that hemagglutinin did co-localize with a small pool of STING early during infection, and STING was precipitated with hemagglutinin in cell lysates from infected cells. The observation that most STING did not co-localize with hemagglutinin could suggest that the STING-hemagglutinin interaction is very transient in nature or that only the pool of STING engaged in sensing of fusion is targeted by hemagglutinin. Since STING needs to be activated to stimulate signalling, and the cGAS-STING pathway is not activated by RNA viruses, our data could suggest that hemagglutinin selectively targets the pool of STING recruited to endosomes, thus preventing fusion-stimulated signalling.",

FP interacted directly with STING in the region between the residues 162 and 172 on mSTING and antagonized dimerization, thus preventing TBK1 phosphorylation and interferon expression. The HA2 FP is highly conserved between IAV strains 20 , and future work should seek to mechanistically dissect the action of FP in viral entry versus STING interaction. This could potentially allow studies with viruses able to enter into cells but unable to evade the ARTICLE STING pathway, and would also lead to better prediction of pathogenicity of emerging IAV strains. It is known that IAV targets the RIG-I pathway. The non-structural protein 1 interacts with RIG-I and antagonizes downstream signalling via MAVS by inhibiting the TRIM25 E3 ligases responsible for RIG-I CARD ubiquitination 17 . Thus, together with the data presented in this work, there is now evidence to support that IAV has evolved means to evade signalling through both MAVS-and STINGdriven pathways. Collectively, this work establishes a novel cGAS-independent mechanism of STING activation, which is involved in achieving full antiviral responses against enveloped RNA viruses. A key question now emerging is what might be the mechanisms governing the non-canonical mechanism of cGAS-independent STING activation.",

XT Sample buffer and reducing agent was also purchased from Biorad. For STING dimerization blotting of STING was performed using a mRabbit antibody (D2P2F, dilution 1:1,000) from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for pTBK1 was purchased also from Cell Signaling Technology (dilution 1:1,000). hemagglutinin (dilution 1:1,000) and Giantin (dilution 1:1,000) antibodies were purchased from Abcam. Secondary antibodies for confocal imaging and western blotting were purchased from Invitrogen (dilution 1:500) and Jackson ImmunoResearch (dilution 1:10,000), respectively. Uncropped immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9 . For confocal imaging cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stained with respective antibodies, with DAPI for nuclear staining, mounted in proLong Gold (Molecular probes) and vizualised using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning microscope.",
