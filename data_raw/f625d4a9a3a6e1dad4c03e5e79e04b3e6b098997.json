In addition, monthly repeated sampling was performed on 430 dromedaries from four herds in two different countries (Isiolo and Nakuru) for a period of 7 months (from April to October 2017). In total, n = 2175 nasal swab samples were collected. All samples were stored frozen in TRIzol buffer at \u221280\u00b0C.

For 2/7 samples, which had very low MERS-CoV RNA concentrations (<2 x 10 4 copies/ml), confirmatory RT-PCR testing and sequencing were unsuccessful. The mean viral load for 5/7 samples was 1.1 x 10 7 (range 1.2 x 10 5 -5.0 x 10 7 ) RNA copies per ml buffer. Four of the five MERS-CoV RNA-positive animals were female and <1 year old, consistent with previous observations that juvenile dromedaries and possibly females may be the main sources for MERS-CoV excretion 9 . The MERS-CoV RNA-positive animals belonged to two different dromedary camel herds in Dabel and Lombolio, which are both located within Isiolo country. However, the herds neighbor each other and share common pastures and water sources. introduced into the two herds. The dromedaries were sampled on the same day, suggesting simultaneous cocirculation of two different MERS-CoV strains and perhaps an unexplored infection dynamic in Isiolo, which is a camel congregation location. To experimentally confirm the presence of two independently circulating MERS-CoV strains and to rule out sample cross-contamination, we generated complete MERS-CoV genome sequences using a previously established protocol 10 . Full genome sequences were generated for one specimen of each of the two positive herds using the samples with the highest MERS-CoV RNA concentrations (5.0 x 10 7 and 3.7 x 10 6 copies/ml). Other confirmed MERS-CoVpositive samples were assigned to two different MERS-CoV isolates (\"Dabel\" or \"Lombolio\") by amplifying and sequencing single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the spike gene and the open reading frame 3 (Supplementary Table) . All three viruses from Dabel and both viruses from Lombolio shared the same polymorphism patterns.",

As the mutation was not among the 14 amino-acid residues that directly interact with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptor 12 , phenotypic traits of these new clade C MERS-CoV strains may be comparable to epidemic MERS-CoV strains as described previously 4 .

We provide independent evidence that MERS-CoV from Eastern African dromedaries encode a complete ORF4a/b. The observation that MERS-CoV strains in different parts of Eastern Africa have a complete ORF4a/b suggests the predominance of these strains on the African continent and emphasizes that the ORF4a/b deletion is most likely geographically restricted to Western Africa.",

The putative absence of clades A and B MERS-CoVs on the African continent may be explained by a lack of surveillance and testing and/or by the genetic drift of MERS-CoV on the Arabian Peninsula. The unidirectional export routes from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula may prevent the reintroduction opportunities of clades A and B MERS-CoVs into African dromedary herds. Interestingly, to date, no clade C MERS-CoV strains from Africa have been detected on the Arabian Peninsula, which is rather surprising, given the continuous and extensive export of African dromedaries to the Arabian Peninsula. An explanation for this observation may again be a lack of testing of imported animals and/or the fact that previous clade A/B MERS-CoV infections may have established herd immunity in the Arabian dromedary populations. As CoV infections do not elicit long-lasting (mucosal) immunity, the introduction of clade CMERS-CoV strains on the Arabian Peninsula may be possible in the future and should therefore be monitored.",

The early detection and characterization of emerging MERS-CoV strains with new phenotypic features will be highly relevant for future vaccination strategies and the prediction of epidemics in humans.
