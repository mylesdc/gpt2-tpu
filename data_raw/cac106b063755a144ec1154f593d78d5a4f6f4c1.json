            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection causes acute enteritis in swine of all ages, and especially in suckling piglets. Small intestinal inflammation is considered a central event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infections, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is a key transcription factor in the inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether NF-\u03baB is crucial for inducing inflammation during a TGEV infection. Our results show that NF-\u03baB was activated in swine testicular (ST) cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) cells infected with TGEV, which is consistent with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of TGEV-infected ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor caused the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but did not significantly affect TGEV replication. Individual TGEV protein screening results demonstrated that Nsp2 exhibited a high potential for activating NF-\u03baB and enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functional domain analyzes indicated that the first 120 amino acid residues of Nsp2 were essential for NF-\u03baB activation. Taken together, these data suggested that NF-\u03baB activation was a major contributor to TGEV infection-induced inflammation, and that Nsp2 was the key viral protein involved in the regulation of inflammation, with amino acids 1-120 playing a critical role in activating NF-\u03baB.

It is an enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a length of approximately 28.6 kb, with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [2] . The TGEV genome contains at least nine open reading frames (ORFs), including two large ORFs in the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome (ORF1a and ORF1b), which encode the viral replicase [2] , while one-third of the genome encodes the four structural proteins, S, M, N, and E, and the three accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, and 7 [2] . Various breeds of pigs, regardless of age, could be infected by TGEV, with suckling piglets under two weeks of age being the most susceptible. Infected animals present with vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea, with the mortality rate possibly reaching up to 100% [3] . TGEV replicates in enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine, resulting in severe gastroenteritis in diseased piglets [4] , which suggests that the inflammation of the small intestine might be an important event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infections.",

In mammals, the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors consists of five members, p65/RelA, RelB, cRel, p50, and p52. All NF-\u03baB transcription factors possess a structurally conserved amino-terminal Relhomology domain that contains the dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA-binding domains [11] . In unstimulated cells, NF-\u03baB dimers are mainly retained in the cytosol in an inactive form that results from interactions with inhibitor proteins of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (I\u03baB) family. Various signals, including cytokines, growth factors, microbial products, stress-inducing stimuli, and T cell receptor engagement could induce canonical NF-\u03baB signaling [12] . Upon activation, the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates I\u03baB proteins, resulting in their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby releasing NF-\u03baB dimers from the cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB-I\u03baB complex and allowing them to translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of target genes [13] .",

In the current study, we found that TGEV infection induced the inflammatory response through NF-\u03baB signal activation, but that NF-\u03baB inhibition did not significantly affect TGEV replication. Screening of TEGV-encoded proteins demonstrated that Nsp2 acted as a major component that was responsible for inducing an inflammatory response, and that the N-terminal 120-amino-acid region formed a critical domain involved in NF-\u03baB activation.",

After 12 h, cells were mock-infected or infected with TGEV or UV-TGEV. At various times post-infection, the luciferase activity of TGEV-infected cells was significantly higher than that of the UV-TGEV-infected group and the mock-infected group (Figure 1(a) ). To confirm whether there was a direct link between the viral-infection dose and NF-\u03baB activity, ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells transfected with pNF-\u03baB-Luc and pRL-TK were infected with TGEV at different titers. We found that TGEV infection enhanced NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1(b) ). To further confirm the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway during TGEV infection, the translocation of p65 was monitored in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV by fluorescence microscopy.

Although TGEV-induced inflammation has been well-established, its exact underlying molecular mechanism is not understood. Previous studies show that NF-\u03baB was activated in TGEV-infected ST and porcine kidney (PK)-15 cells [7, 8] . Considering that the small intestine was the main target organ attacked by TGEV and that IPEC-J2 cells, a spontaneously immortalized cell line from the porcine intestine, are likely much more representative of porcine physiology and the true state of virus infection in animals [25, 26] , IPEC-J2 cells were used in current study in addition to ST cells. Previous studies showed that IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV displayed increased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 [27, 28] . The current study further demonstrated that TGEV could activate NF-\u03baB in IPEC-J2 cells, by using a luciferase reporter gene assay and IFA. In addition, the expression of pro-inflammatory genes induced by the TGEV infection was associated with NF-\u03baB activation. In another similar phenomenon, treatment with the NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor significantly decreased TGEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production, as described in Ding's study [29] . The above results suggested that intestinal inflammation during TGEV infection resulted mainly because of NF-\u03baB activation.",

            "text": "Inflammation is an innate immune defense mechanism that is induced in response to physical, physiological, and/or oxidative stresses, and NF-\u03baB functions as a crucial coordinator of inflammatory and immune response [10] . In addition, NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation [30] . Some viruses utilize NF-\u03baB modulation to evade the innate immune response of the host that limit replication by killing infected cells, as well as to enhance viral replication and exploit the anti-apoptotic properties of NF-\u03baB, or trigger apoptosis for increasing the spread of viruses [31] . To explore whether NF-\u03baB activation influences TGEV replication, we used the NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitors to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in cells infected with TGEV. To improve the accuracy of the results, two NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitors, Bay 11-7082 and QNZ, were used in this study. TGEV exhibited a slightly faster growth rate in NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor-treated cells than in DMSO-treated cells, but it did not reach a significant level. Consistent results were obtained in the different inhibitor-treated groups. These results suggested NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation had no remarkable effects on TGEV replication, which was consistent with the results of the previous study [29] . Conversely, other researchers reported that NF-\u03baB inhibition leads to the suppression of TGEV replication [7] . It should be noted that Yang et al [7] and our group employed different NF-\u03baB inhibitors that inhibited NF-\u03baB activation through different pathways. Multiple associations between signaling pathways or networks might have orchestrated NF-\u03baB activation [32] ; a previous study showed that TGEV induced NF-\u03baB activation through RLR-mediated signaling in (a) ST cells were co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-Luc, pRL-TK, and the indicated expression plasmid encoding the TGEV protein, or truncated segments. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by western blotting using the anti-HA antibody and cell extracts were prepared for luciferase reporter gene assays. P values < 0.05 (*) and < 0.01 (**) were considered to be statistically significant and highly significant, respectively.(b) Increasing quantities of Nsp2 expression plasmids (0 \u03bcg, 0.5 \u03bcg, 1 \u03bcg, and 1.5 \u03bcg) were co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-Luc and pRL-TK into ST cells. Cells were harvested and analyzed by western blotting using the anti-HA antibody and luciferase activity measurement at 36 h post-transfection. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD values. P values < 0.05 (*) and < 0.01 (**) were considered statistically significant and highly significant, respectively.",

The total amount of transfected DNA was kept equal by adding appropriate amounts of the empty vector. At 36 h post-transfection, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody, antibodies specific for endogenous I\u03baB\u03b1, p65, and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65), using \u03b2-actin and histone H as the controls. The right panel represents the quantification of the bands by densitometry, corrected by the amount of \u03b2-actin or histone H3.(b) Nsp2-HA was transiently expressed in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells\uff0crespectively. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies to HA and endogenous p65, followed by TRITCconjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (red) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope. NF-\u03baB [33] , while the absence of the SARS E protein results in a reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [6] . In addition, the accessory proteins 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 of SARS are capable of activating both NF-\u03baB and JNK, and significantly enhance IL-8 promoter activity [9] . Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) encodes an accessory protein ns12.9, which is involved in the inflammatory response during an HCoV-OC43 infection [34] . PEDV-encoded N and S proteins are responsible for the up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 expression [35, 36] . In the current study, results obtained after screening TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that Nsp2 was the most potent NF-\u03baB activator and that it induced pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 production, mainly by the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Nsp3, Nsp6, Nsp14, and ORF7 were also found to be potential NF-\u03baB activators, in addition to Nsp2. Nsp14 has been identified as a key inducer of IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK-293T cells and PK-15 cells and has been found to act through the activation of NF-\u03baB [8] ; in addition, a specific mutation within Nsp14 led to a reduction in the expression of IFN-\u03b2, TNF, and interferon-stimulated genes [37] . According to our results, 4NF-\u03baB activation was also observed in Nsp14-transfected ST cells. However, the potential of Nsp14 in inducing NF-\u03baB activation in ST cells is weaker than that of Nsp2. Additionally, the potential of Nsp2 in inducing NF-\u03baB activation in IPEC-J2 cells was also be confirmed in this study. There are multiple possible reasons for the discrepancies, the different kinds of cells were probably the main reason. Relatively fewer studies have investigated the effects of other TGEV-encoded proteins.",

They are implicated in the regulation of several cellular processes, including replication, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [38, 39] . Interestingly, the ZnF of TGEV Nsp14 is reported to potentially play a role in modulating the expression of IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and interferon-stimulated genes in ST cells [37] . However, it is still unclear whether the ZnF of TGEV Nsp2 is associated with NF-\u03baB activation. Our data suggest that the ZnF of TGEV Nsp2 was unrelated to the activation of NF-\u03baB. Even with the uncertainty regarding the effect of the ZnF, our analyzes, which were performed using truncated mutants allowed us to map the key domain responsible for activating NF-\u03baB to the 120 amino acids of the N-terminal end of the Nsp2 protein. Although the above experiments were conducted in vitro, IPEC-J2 cells are morphologically differentiated cells derived from the small intestine of young piglets, which can be used as a well-defined in vitro model with comparable intestinal physiology [25] [26] [27] [28] . Based on these results, we predicted that Nsp2 could promote intestinal inflammation in TGEV-infected piglets, and the Nsp2-induced inflammation may cause damage of intestine barrier which would benefit the spread of TGEV to deeper intestine tissue.",
