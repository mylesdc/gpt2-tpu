Furthermore, the precursor report (Del'Guidice et al. 2018) seems to have committed the same error. Instead, it is appropriate to use the equation 100 x (1-(1-(b+c) / (a+b+c))^(1/2), where a is the intensity of undigested PCR product, and b and c are the intensities of the cleaved products (see Guschin et al.

In Figure 5 , referring to the peptide as simply \"shuttle\" is counter-productive and confusing, especially since other figures use the term \"peptide\". I propose the text \"shuttle\" in the figure be replaced with \"CM18-PTD4 peptide\". An analogous improvement could be made to Supplemental Figure 4 (specify the peptide identity in the figure itself). Generally, the reader should be able to know which cargo and which peptide is being specified. In this sense Figure 4 (Cas9 delivered via S10) is an improvement over Figure 6 (Cas12a can be inferred if the reader really tries; no mention of the peptide).",

Building off of a previous report from Feldan Therapeutics that established the CM18-PTD4 shuttle peptide, the present work details the ability of shuttle variant sequences to perform transduction of macromolecular cargo including enzymes such as Cas9 and Cas12a. The results are encouraging and indeed demonstrate that shuttle-driven genome editing can induce clinically-relevant levels of genome editing in airway epithelia in mice without causing marked short-term toxicity. This paper is well written, the data are clearly presented, and the conclusions are in accordance with the results. This work represents a substantial advance for the field of non-viral macromolecular delivery (especially that of genome editing enzymes), which has great clinical promise.",
