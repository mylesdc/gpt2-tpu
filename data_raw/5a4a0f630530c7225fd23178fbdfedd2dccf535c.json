We investigated the antimicrobial effect of glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) and its derivatives against 50 clinical S. aureus strains, including 18 methicillin-resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GRA, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate (GR-SU), stearyl glycyrrhetinate and glycyrrhetinyl stearate were evaluated against various S. aureus strains. Additionally, we investigated the bactericidal effects of GRA and GR-SU against two specific S. aureus strains. DNA microarray analysis was also performed to clarify the mechanism underlying the antibacterial activity of GR-SU. We detected the antimicrobial activities of five agents against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU showed strong antibacterial activities compared to the other three agents tested. At a higher concentration (above 2x MIC), GRA and GR-SU showed bactericidal activity, whereas at a concentration of 1x MIC, they showed a bacteriostatic effect. Additionally, GRA and GR-SU exhibited a synergistic effect with gentamicin. The expression of a large number of genes (including transporters) and metabolic factors (carbohydrates and amino acids) was altered by the addition of GR-SU, suggesting that the inhibition of these metabolic processes may influence the degree of the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids. In fact, the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids was increased in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU exhibited strong antibacterial activity against several S. aureus strains, including MRSA. This activity may be partly due to the inhibition of several pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.",

The fluorescently labeled cDNAs were purified using the FairPlay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies) The Cy3-labeled and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized onto an array using the Hi-RPM Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies). The arrays were scanned with an Agilent scanner, and data extraction, filtering and normalization were conducted using the Agilent Feature Extraction software according to the manufacturer's instructions.

As summarized in Fig 4, more than 200 genes exhibited altered expression levels in response to GR-SU. Among these, 39 phage-related genes were increased by the addition of GR-SU. In the S. aureus MW2 genome, two phage-related operons (MW1380-MW1451 and MW1882-MW1952) were found. Specifically, in the operon of MW1380-MW1451 (72 genes), the expression of 31 genes was increased. Many genes responsible for metabolic and biosynthetic pathways also exhibited altered expression patterns (S3-S6 Tables). The expression levels of 6 genes involved in protein synthesis, 10 genes in RNA synthesis and 2 genes in amino acid metabolism were increased, whereas the levels of 8 genes for RNA synthesis, 12 genes for carbohydrate metabolism and 8 genes for amino acid metabolism were decreased. In addition, the expression levels of 2 transporter and substrate-binding protein genes were increased, and 16 genes were decreased after GR-SU treatment. Regarding pathogenic factors, the expression of 3 factors was increased while that of 8 factors was decreased. Effect of GRA and GR-SU on virulence factor expression As we found in the microarray analysis, the expression levels of several virulence-related genes were altered in response to GR-SU. We analyzed the gene expression of RNAIII, which is a key factor involved in the expression of many virulence genes, in more detail by quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig 5A and 5B , RNAIII expression was significantly increased during the exponential phase in the absence of GRA or GR-SU, whereas GRA and GR-SU both fully suppressed RNAIII expression at 1/4 MIC. The expression of seh, which is a RNAIII-dependent virulence factor, exhibited a pattern similar to that of RNAIII in response to GRA and GR-SU added to the medium. The growth and colony counts were monitored. Three independent experiments were performed, and the mean \u00b1 SD was calculated. The data were analyzed for statistically significant differences compared to untreated control by a two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc tests. *P<0.05. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165831.g002 (Fig 5C and 5D) . These results suggest that the repression of RNAIII by GR-SU may explain the alterations in gene expression of several virulence-related genes, which were observed in the microarray analysis (Fig 4) . Three independent experiments were performed, and the mean \u00b1 SD was calculated. The data were analyzed for statistically significant differences compared to the untreated control by a two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. Significant differences were not observed. Therefore, we investigated the expression levels of 12 virulence factors and found that several toxins such as sea, clfAB and hlgC were downregulated by GRA, whereas the cell surface factors fnbA and ica were upregulated (Fig 6) . The effect of GR-SU on virulence factor expression was similar to that of GRA.",

Therefore, we investigated sugar and amino acid requirements in the presence of GRA, GR-SU or GRA-K (1/2 MIC or 1/4 MIC at the final concentration for each agent). As shown in Table 4 , the minimum concentrations of each sugar for the growth of S. aureus MW2 in CDM containing glucose, sucrose, lactose or trehalose was increased by 2-or 4-fold in the presence of 1/2 MIC of GRA or GR-SU, whereas GRA-K did not increase the sugar requirement. Additionally, we investigated the amino acid requirements. GRA and GR-SU treatment caused a 2-fold higher requirement compared to untreated bacteria. When 1/4 MIC of GRA or GR-SU was used, the minimal concentration of each sugar or amino acids was not altered. ",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the antibacterial activities of GRA and GR-SU against S. aureus strains. These two compounds exhibited strong antibacterial activities, but the antibacterial activities of the other GRA derivatives (GR-S, GR-K and GR-SA) were much weaker than those of GRA and GR-SU. GR-SU is synthesized from GRA by adding a succinic acid moiety to increase water solubility. GR-K (dipotassium glycyrrhizate) is a potassium salt of glycyrrhizin (GRA with two glucuronic acids) and also has high water solubility. Both GR-SU and GR-K have high water solubility, but the antibacterial effect of GR-K is much lower than that of GR-SU. Thus, difference in water solubility is not related to the difference in antibacterial activity among these compounds. Instead, some other structural differences between the two agents (Fig 1) may affect their antibacterial activities against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU have been clinically used as anti-inflammatory agents [21, 32] . Taken together with our findings, GRA and GR-SU are expected to exert two biological activities of clinical importance: antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Although several investigations regarding the antibacterial effects of GRA have been reported [28, 29] , this is the first report of the use of GR-SU as an antibacterial agent. Glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives are known anti-inflammatory drugs [30, 31, 32] . Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, which is the most well-known glycyrrhetinic acid derivative drug, contains 2 mg/ml of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate hydrate at the dose used to clinically treat chronic hepatitis; this dose is approximately 4-to 20-fold higher than the concentration used in this study [26, 27] . Therefore, GRA and GR-SU may have a potential use against S. aureus infectious diseases caused by antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects.",

Moreover, the expression levels of many genes that encoded transporters were also decreased (S6 Table) . These results suggest that GRA and GR-SU-treatments inhibit the uptake of nutrients, which then causes alterations in the expression of genes related to nutrient metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, S. aureus MW2 required a higher concentration of sugars and amino acids in the presence of GRA and GR-SU than in the absence of these compounds (Table 4 ). Based on these findings, we propose that GRA and GR-SU have no specific mechanism for antibacterial activity but induce antimicrobial effects by inhibiting nutrient acquisition and affecting bacterial metabolism. Additionally, the expression of several transporters responsible for the efflux and/or influx of compounds was increased in the microarray analysis. The transporters with altered expression levels in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU included some transporters that might be involved in the high susceptibility to gentamicin in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU had weak synergistic activities with other protein synthesis inhibitors, speculating that transporters specific for gentamicin influx may be influenced by GRA and GR-SU.",
