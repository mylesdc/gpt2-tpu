Previous studies showed that H1N1 virus cannot replicate efficiently in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 knock-out mice whereas H3N2 viruses are able to replicate to the same levels in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 as in wild type (WT) mice. Here, we investigated the sequence requirements for the HA molecule that allow IAV to replicate efficiently in the absence of TMPRSS2. We showed that replacement of the H3 for the H1-loop sequence (amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA 1 ) was not sufficient for equal levels of virus replication or severe pathology in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 knock-out mice compared to WT mice. However, exchange of a distant amino acid from H1 to H3 sequence (E31D) in addition to the HA-loop substitution resulted in virus replication in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 knockout mice that was comparable to WT mice. The higher virus replication and lung damage was associated with increased epithelial damage and higher mortality. Our results provide further evidence and insights into host proteases as a promising target for therapeutic intervention of IAV infections.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV), a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is responsible for a highly contagious respiratory illness that affects millions of people worldwide during seasonal epidemics causing huge mortality and economic loss [1, 2] . H1N1 and H3N2 are the presently circulating virus subtypes that cause yearly epidemics in humans. The receptor-binding surface molecule haemagglutinin (HA) forms homotrimers [3] . It is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule HA 0 and proteolytically processed into the subunits HA 1 and HA 2 that are connected by a disulfide bond. Activation of HA is important for its fusion potential with the endosome including a conformational change to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm (reviewed in [4] [5] [6] [7] ). Depending on the protease recognition motif, several proteases have been identified to cleave HA (reviewed in [5] [6] [7] [8] ). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to cleave H1-and monobasic H7-HA in vitro at the cleavage sites PSIQSR#G and PEIPKR#G, respectively [4, 9] . Furthermore, in mouse knock-out (KO) mutants, it was shown that Tmprss2-deficient (Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) mice are highly resistant to infections with H1N1 and monobasic H7N9, but only weakly to H3N2 [10] [11] [12] . In resistant Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, H1-and H7-HA are not efficiently cleaved and subsequently the virus fails to spread in infected lungs and therefore does not cause pathology [10] [11] [12] . On the other hand, H3N2 is able to replicate in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and cause mortality [10, 13] . In Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 Tmprss4 \u00c0/\u00c0 double KO mice, replication of H3N2 is still occurring although at a strongly reduced level resulting in low mortality [14] . Thus, the H3-HA motif PEKQTR#G is not only processed by TMPRSS2, but also by TMPRSS4 and at least one more, yet unknown protease [14] .",

For this, we generated several reassortants and mutant viruses based on A/ Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (HK). Plasmids were generated by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 to rescue viruses. We first generated two reassorted viruses, HK_HA(PR8) carrying the entire HA segment of H1 on the backbone of HK, and PR8_HA(HK) carrying the entire HA segment of H3 on the backbone of PR8 (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, we generated a recombinant virus [PR8_HA(MVEKT)] in which we replaced the HA cleavage site and neighbouring amino acids of H1-HA with the amino acid sequence of H3-HA (region from amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA 1 , Fig. 1 ). We refer to this HA region as the 'HA-loop' which is predicted to interact with cellular proteases and in which HA cleavage occurs between amino acids R329 and G330 (Fig. 1) . Additionally, we produced a virus in which we also exchanged a more distant amino acid from the H1-HA to the H3-HA sequence that is predicted to interact with amino acids in the loop (see below for more details) either by itself or in combination with the loop exchange. In these viruses, referred to as PR8_HA(D) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), respectively, the glutamate at position 31 was replaced by aspartate from H3 (E31 to D31, Fig. 1 ). Of note, we could not rescue recombinant virus with single amino acid exchange in the H1-HA-loop (predicted protease recognition sequence: H1-PSIQSR to H3-PEKQTR) suggesting that the entire H1-HA-loop or H3-HA-loop sequence is required for a functional HA. The replaced and mutated HA segments (segment 4) were incorporated into viruses with an isogenic PR8 backbone for all other segments (Fig. 1 ).",

PR8, HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK). After infection with PR8 (H1N1), WT mice lost body weight and all infected mice died, whereas Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice lost body weight only slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 2a) . Infection with HK_HA(PR8) resulted in body weight loss in WT similar to infections with PR8 whereas Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice showed a similar resistance phenotype as for infections with PR8 (Fig. 2b) . These results demonstrate that the resistance phenotype to H1N1 virus in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice resides in the H1-HA segment and that other proteins of the HK virus do not have a major impact. Infection of Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT mice with PR8_HA(HK) led to body weight loss in both mouse strains and death of all infected mice (Fig. 2c) . These results are consistent with our previous observations using the entire HK (H3N2) virus [10] . Also, Fig. 1 . Scheme of recombinant viruses. The structure of recombinant viruses with name, origin of segment 4 (HA), origin of the loop, backbone segments (Other proteins) and relevant HA amino acid sequences are illustrated. Differences at the amino acid level are shown for the N-terminal part (amino acids [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and the protease recognition site with its neighbouring region (amino acids 320-329, H3 numbering), which we refer to here as the 'HA-loop' (highlighted in green). HA 1 is highlighted in orange (except the HA-loop) and HA 2 in yellow. Differences in amino acid sequences between HA-HK and HA-PR8 are labelled red. The arrow indicates where cleavage occurs. PR8: A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); HK: A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2). results with the reassorted viruses HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK) were identical to the results from the parental viruses (PR8, HK) in previous studies when the same infection dose was used (2\u00c210 3 f.f.u.; Fig. S1 , available in the online version of this article). Together, our results demonstrate that exchange of the HA segments leads to a phenotype that resembles that of the parental virus (H1N1 or H3N2, respectively) in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT mice. Thus, H3-HA is necessary and sufficient for body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.",

For this, we exchanged the H3 sequence (MRNVPEKQTR) for the HA-loop of H1 (LRNIP-SIQSR) resulting in virus PR8_HA(MVEKT). Infection of WT mice showed that PR8_HA(MVEKT) was not as pathogenic as the parental PR8 virus; only 50 % of the infected WT mice died after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) compared to 100 % lethality of WT mice after infection with PR8 or PR8_HA(HK) (Fig. 3a) . More importantly, after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) virus, Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice only lost body weight slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 3a) .

By this approach, we identified a salt bridge formed by arginine at position 321 and glutamic acid at position 31 which is located in proximity to the HA-loop and thus might play a role for protease recognition (Fig. 4) . Therefore, we also replaced this amino acid in H1 with the equivalent amino acid from the H3 sequence in addition to the HA-loop: aspartic acid at position 31 (mutant E31D). This resulted in virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (Fig. 1 ). Of note, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) could only be rescued after exchange of the codon GAG (encoding for glutamic acid, nucleotide 144-146) to GAU, but not GAC (both encoding for aspartic acid) which might be due to a restriction in the cis-acting specific packaging signal [17] . After infection with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice showed strong body weight loss with a similar kinetic as WT mice (Fig. 3b) . Also, all of the infected WT mice and 40 % of infected Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice died (Fig. 3b) . Thus, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) is able to cause considerable body weight loss and mortality also in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice although to a lesser extent. We confirmed that both exchanges are required for the higher pathogenicity of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) by studying the pathogenicity of the single mutant PR8_HA(D) virus (Figs 1 and S2). This virus exhibits slightly higher pathogenicity (body weight loss similar, one mouse died) in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice than PR8 but was much less virulent than PR8_HA(D-MVEKT).",

At day 4 after infection with HK_HA(PR8) the viral load was lower than at day 2, but still the same for WT and Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 (Fig. 5) . In contrast to this observation, the viral load of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) at 4 days p.i. was lower in Tmprss2 \u00c0/ \u00c0 mice compared to the WT. This is in agreement with the higher survival rate of Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Additionally, viral replication was significantly higher in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) compared to infections with PR8_HA(MVEKT) or PR8 at day 2 and 4 ( Fig. 5) . Thus, the difference in virus virulence (body weight loss and mortality) between PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and PR8_HA (MVEKT) can be explained by differences in viral replication in infected lungs and thus increased tissue damage.",

Yet, two studies showed that replication of H3N2 was only marginally affected and caused pathology in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice [10, 12] . A third study described an H3N2 variant that was not able to replicate in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice [11] . However, after serial passages in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, this virus acquired a mutation in the HA stalk which led to replication and pathology in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice [13] . Moreover, we recently demonstrated that in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 Tmprss4 \u00c0/\u00c0 double knock-out mice, replication and pathology after infection with our H3N2 isolate was strongly diminished and infected mice survived. These observations suggest that H3 viruses are able to replicate in a Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 background whereas H1 viruses cannot. Here, we investigated in detail the differences in the HA sequence that are responsible for the different behaviour of H1 and H3 viruses in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. For this, we generated a series of reassorted and mutated IAV and analysed body weight loss, survival, viral replication in lung, lung epithelial cell damage, and cleavage of the HA protein in WT and Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.",

However, replacement of the HA-loop and additional replacement of a distant amino acid, E31 by aspartic acid from H3-HA, strongly increased mortality of Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice after infection [virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. The increase in pathology was due to a higher viral replication and increased lung epithelial damage which was comparable to WT mice infected with this virus. E31 is predicted to interact with R321 of the HA-loop in H1-HA. The exchange of E31 and accompanied changes of the HA protease recognition site could lead to an altered accessibility of the HAloop for other proteases than TMPRSS2 in [PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. Several in vitro studies also suggested that the exchange of the HA-loop itself does not necessarily lead to productive HA processed by matriptase protease [18] . Furthermore, when the cleavage site of an H1-HA was exchanged by the amino acid sequence RSSR, matriptase was still unable to cleave the HA-loop. Similarly, an H9-HA carrying the minimal furin cleavage motif was not cleaved by furin [19] . Further studies are thus needed to address the role of additional proteases and requirements for a fully functional HA processing. The importance of a distant amino acid on the pathogenicity of an H3 virus had been shown before by exchanging amino acid 8 in HA resulting in the loss of a glycosylation site and increased pathogenicity [13, 20] . In addition, it was shown that cleavage by TMPRSS2 results in a less glycosylated HA 1 compared to cleavage by trypsin or TMPRSS4 [8] . Thus, our in vivo study confirms previous in vitro analyses demonstrating the role of loop and distant amino acids for viral replication.",

Thus, our main conclusions relate to the difference of virus pathogenicity and replication between WT and Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.

In other studies, the degree of the inflammatory response and the resulting immunopathology has also been described as a major contributor to disease severity [21, 23] . In this study, histopathological analysis showed that tissue damage was the major correlate for disease severity. It also correlated well with replication (between WT and mutant mice for a given virus) whereas tissue inflammation was not significantly correlated. We thus hypothesize that virus replication and subsequent tissue damage is the main cause for disease severity. This conclusion is well in line with the interpretation that the absence or presence of specific proteases is the main driver for virus maturation, and subsequently its replication and spread in the infected lung and eventually severity of the disease. A similar result was obtained from patients infected with pandemic 2009 H1N1 or H7N9. Patients whose genome carried a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2 were more severely ill than patients expressing less TMPRSS2 [24] .",

However, Western blot analysis revealed that the HA-loop of both viruses, PR8_HA (MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), was cleaved in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Nevertheless, PR8_HA(MVEKT) was less efficiently cleaved compared to PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). One likely explanation could be that PR8_HA(MVEKT) is cleaved by a protease that recognizes the HA protein at a nearby but markedly different cleavage site than the trypsin-like TMPRSS2. Such a shift by a single or three amino acids is sufficient to cause cleavage but would thus not result in efficiently activated particles as has been reported for cleavage of H3-HA by thermolysin and chymotrypsin Lungs were prepared at day 4 p.i., sectioned and stained with H&E. PR8 and all recombinant viruses caused severe damage of bronchial epithelium (inserts) in the lungs from WT mice. In contrast, in Tmprss2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice regions of severely damaged epithelial layers (inserts) were mainly observed in PR8_HA(HK) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) infected animals, whereas PR8 and PR8_HA(MVEKT) only produced mild or no damage of bronchial epithelium (inserts). Note also the similar degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in all infected mice. Bars, 200 \u00b5m. [25, 26] . A second possibility could be that the respective unknown protease cleaves at the same site as TMPRSS2 but does not generate activated particles, as has been described for hepsin [8] . In both cases, these viruses would not be infectious and do not lead to high titres, tissue damage and death of the animals although the HA protein is cleaved.",

Another candidate may be TMPRSS11D (HAT), which was shown in vitro to cleave H3-HA [27, 28] . Additionally, it was described that H3 can be cleaved in vitro by kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5), tryptase Clara (TPSB2), TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) [6, 29, 30] .

HEK 293T and MDCK cells were co-cultured in a six-well plate and grown 24 h at 37 C in 5 % CO 2 until cells reached confluency. Cells were washed and 800 \u00b5l OptiMEM (Gibco) were added. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio LLC) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 \u00b5g of each plasmid and 15 \u00b5l Lipofectamine or 16 \u00b5l TransIT-LT1, respectively. Within 24 h post transfection medium was exchanged with 2 ml MEM containing 1 % P/S and 1 \u00b5g TPCK-trypsin (tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone treated trypsin) (Sigma). Cells were monitored every day until a cytopathic effect appeared and virus was harvested. After amplification of virus, RNA was extracted and whole virus genome was confirmed using next generation sequencing by Illumina (see Cells and viruses).",

Cell debris was spun down for 10 min with 200 g at 4 C to obtain the supernatant containing virus. Virus titres were determined using f.f.u. assay. For this, viruses were serially tenfold diluted in infection medium [MEM containing 0.1 % BSA, 2.5 \u00b5g ml \u00c01 NAT (N-acetylated trypsin, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 % P/S]. MDCK II cells (6\u00c210 4 cells/well of a 96-well plate, grown for 24 h in MEM supplemented with 1 % P/S) were washed with infection medium.

Cells were stained 24 h p.i. at room temperature. For this, cells were washed with 100 \u00b5l PBS and fixed with 96 % ice-cold ethanol for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with 100 \u00b5l PBS and permeabilized with 0.5 % Triton X-100 and 20 mM glycin in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed with 100 \u00b5l wash buffer (WB) (0.5 % Tween 20 in PBS) and 50 \u00b5l primary antibody were added for 40 min (1 : 1000 in WB, goat antiinfluenza virions 1301, Virostat).

Finally, after two wash steps with 100 \u00b5l WB, 30 \u00b5l of the substrate were added (TrueBlue, KPL) and incubated for 30 min until blue spots appeared. The substrate was then washed with tap water, cells were dried and foci were counted. Titres were calculated as f.f.u. ml \u00c01 (virus stocks) or f.f.u./lung (lung homogenates).",
