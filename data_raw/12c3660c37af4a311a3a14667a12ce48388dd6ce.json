            "text": "Under a traditional paradigm, only those with the expected background knowledge consume academic literature. The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today's fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity.",

For example, statements of \"elevated temperature\" were scored as mentioning \"fever\" so that scoring was offset in favor of credit for mentioning topics. However, sweeping statements were not broadly scored. For example, mentioning EVD spread \"outside of Western Africa\" did not entail credit for specific nations involved. Similarly, statements discussing personal protective equipment were not credited unless the specific item was named. As much as possible, each article was judged as if it each was the only one available to the reader. Therefore, stating that personal protective equipment (PPE) entailed \"gloves, gown, and face mask\" was considered an error of omission given that a reader would not know additional PPE would be needed unless they had read additional sources. Overt errors were statements that were simply untrue, such as claims that the outbreak began in March of 2014 instead of December 2013 [86] (which would not have been erroneous if stated in the early stages of the outbreak, but this information was established by the time of the article's publication). Caveated inaccuracies were those presenting inaccurate statements as uncertainty (such as \"Airborne spread is rare or absent\" [14] when only \"absent\" is correct) or to place an unnecessary qualifier in front of accurate statements that has the potential to cast doubt (such as \"from what we know of the science, Ebola is not an airborne disease\")(Huffington Post 11)). Such qualifiers placed in front of discussion of airborne transmission, but not in front of any other statement could suggest doubt (for example, no article stated 'from what we know, EVD is a viral disease'). The final error category was statements made without citation to a verifiable source.",

Ebola virus is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC) like macrophages and dendritic cells, which then migrate to the lymph nodes where they would normally help amplify the normal immune response. However in EVD, the APC die and spread the virus into the lymphatic system and eventually the spleen. As immune cells become infected, they release inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which attract other immune cells to the infected area that are then also infected. This process amplifies upon itself, cells become infected, die, produce cytokines, bringing in more cells, which become infected, die, etc. This creates an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation known as a \"cytokine storm\" which can damage the patient's own tissues and organs. Furthermore, as Ebola virus kills immune cells, the body is left susceptible to other forms of infection. In fatal cases, infection and tissue damage cause death through shock and multisystem organ failure.",

While experimental therapies, and a handful of vaccination strategies showed promising results during the 2013-2016 outbreak, they did not directly contribute to ultimately controlling the disease. Rather standard public health measures were able to curtail the outbreak such as rapid identification and isolation of confirmed cases followed by tracing all their contacts and daily monitoring and/or quarantining them for the recommended 21-days. While the CDC and WHO supported screening travelers for fever departing from Western African nations and upon final arrival, a blanket travel ban was not advised. Travel bans have been counter-productive in past pandemics, as they blocked needed resources from entering and leaving afflicted nations. While recommendations for handling samples in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility was not fully achievable in the Western African environment, strict and frequent decontamination of sample processing and patient care areas with bleach containing solutions was widely practiced.",

Some confusion may have arisen given that \"droplet spread\" can occur by sneezing, which does transmit 'through air'. However, airborne spread is defined by far greater distances of spread and often a far greater infectivity as measured by an R 0 (R-naught) number. The R 0 for EVD (1.9-4.1) is much closer to other fluid-borne diseases like HIV (4) than airborne disease like measles (>18). Effectively, if you are not within close proximity (approximately two meters, or six feet) [119] of a person who has had active signs of EVD, you do not have to fear catching the disease. This rule was somewhat shaken when it was discovered that female sexual partners of male EVD survivors could contract the disease due to viral persistence in semen for several months. Confusing word choice may be to blame for some of the misconceptions surrounding when a person is contagious. Some outlets stated that you could not contract EVD from a person unless they were symptomatic. This was communicated to assure the public of the fact that travelers that passed fever screenings upon entering the US would not be contagious to any of their fellow passengers. A better phrasing may be that a person is not contagious until they manifest symptoms; this phrasing would capture the potential for survivors to spread the virus via semen after active symptoms had resolved. However, these semantics would not impact the consensus that patients manifesting symptoms of EVD are routinely too sick to perform activities of daily living like shopping, driving, or riding public transportation.",

Burial practices in Western Africa included a tradition of kissing and washing dead bodies as a family; this practice was an important source of EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 outbreak. Many in the Western African regions, especially during the early portion of the outbreak, refused to alert officials to potential EVD cases in their families. Years of mistrust in government and foreigners led to initial conflict between the population and the care providing institutions. Additional population risk factors that made Western Africa susceptible for an EVD outbreak included densely populated cities, porous borders, and the profound poverty and under resourced health care systems of the region. A few sources postulated that food insecurity due to climate-change is also theorized to have spurred the outbreak as it increased the need for reliance on the consumption of 'bush meat' that could have come from infected animals [26, 68] . These authors also implicated deforestation as a possible contributor to the outbreak by increasing the interaction of humans with the newly displaced animal population, particularly bats, which are presumed to be the animal vectors for EVD [26, 68] . However, most articles did not cite these environmental findings as underpinnings of the outbreak.",

Review articles were far more likely to discuss elements needed for treatment and containment after the outbreak. For example, mentioning of contact tracing and isolation, detailing the recommended PPE, and the treatment recommendations were all more likely to appear after 2013. It is worth noting that the treatment and containment topics did not contain new information; this information garnered increased focus but did not differ from pre-2013 manuscripts as to reflect 'lessons learned' during the outbreak. Topics that did appear de novo after 2013 included the increased risk of spontaneous abortion for pregnant females and the established finding that hiccups may be a manifestation of EVD, which was overlooked by the review articles selected. The hiccup finding is not a trivial one; it was reported that MSF received early reports of patients with viral syndromes accompanied by hiccups [17] . While this is not a pathognomonic finding, a clustering of suspicious deaths, which included the presence of hiccups alerted MSF officials that the outbreak potentially represented a serious outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. This was the basis for their early appeals to the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a rapid response to the first EVD outbreak in a densely populated area [17] .",

Evidence against natural airborne spread is even more extensive. There have been no cases of EVD suspected of aerosolized transmission. Individuals cohabitating with EVD patients, even in tight quarters, do not contract the disease without contacting blood or body fluid [1, 18, 23, 45, 78, 83, 92] . Furthermore, the R 0 (R-naught) number for EVD is markedly below that of influenza or other diseases known to have an aerosolized potential for spread [1] . Therefore, the only correct way to discuss airborne spread for EVD is to definitively state that such spread does not occur under natural conditions. Statements of airborne transmission within a context of biological warfare were not present in the literature reviewed, but would not have been scored as erroneous. Statements made within a context of a human outbreak that suggest airborne spread 'cannot be excluded' or 'may be possible' are not consistent with the factual conclusions from the totality of the literature.",

However, there was no significant association between impact factor with either completeness (Fig 2A) or error rate; the articles with impact factors greater than 10 were all error free, however this did not reach statistical significance (Fig 2B) . Similarly, the numbers of authors, number of citations, and whether the journal was open access also had no association with either completeness or error rate (Fig 2C-2G) . Only page numbers correlated with completeness (but not errors) for academic publications (Fig 2H and 2I ; p = 0.003, R 2 = 0.234). However, a low number of printed pages did not preclude complete or accurate articles. In fact, the most complete academic paper [1] (80.6%) had no errors, only one author, and needed only 8 pages (below the average of 8.6) due to use of informative tables. This suggests that stereotypical measures of an academic paper's status would not be a valid means for readers to pre-screen review articles for EVD.",

However, Wikipedia revealed one of the top scores with 77.6% after the outbreak and scored a 56.2% before the outbreak. The academic journals were typically over 8 pages while lay press articles were often less than two. Therefore, adjusted for page length there was only slightly and non-significantly higher for academic press (7% of total topics covered per page) compared to Wikipedia (5.5%), magazines (4.7%), newspapers (6.8%), blogs (6.9%), and alternative sites (4.3%). The lower score for magazines was, in part, due to greater presence of large pictures. As a somewhat unexpected finding however was that academic journals carried a higher error rate than magazines, newspapers, and blogs, but not alternative media (Fig 3B) . Although there was one academic paper with 30 different erroneous statements [68] , if this outlier were excluded the difference with alternative media would become significant but it would not change the significance for other lay press sources. Of note, errors in newspaper writings were associated with anonymous authorship and being a letter to the editor or editorial.",

For example, rather than debate the academic nuances of a recent publication on heart disease, a newspaper may focus on communicating which, if any, life style modifications a reader should make when the new study is viewed in the context of the established review article recommendations. To some extent our findings support a potential synergistic dynamic of academia and the lay press. Had our results supported our initial hypothesis and indicated that comprehensive review articles could serve as a collective source of accurate information, the subsequent recommendations would have been to encourage lay press authors to access these journals for background understanding.

These agencies resources should receive their own evaluation as to whether they could have proved accurate contextualization of academic information for lay press background research. The increased completeness seen in the academic review articles collected was likely a reflection of our study design rather than the authors of the individual manuscripts; general review articles were specifically targeted instead of those that may focus on only vaccine development or diagnostics and thus carried a selection offset in favor of completeness. Therefore comparing lay press articles on the same scale of our selected reviews is somewhat artificial.

As another example, a debate over the potential for EVD to be contracted from a bowling ball may never be settled in academia. Even with a dedicated study looking at bowling balls as EVD fomites, no researcher could test for all possible variables such as ambient temperature, porousness of the bowling ball, length on contact, skin integrity of the bowler, starting inoculum, etc. Communications to the public should stress that any actionable policy trying to curtail airborne EVD would waste resources and that no one should cancel their bowling plans.

No pathogen in the history of known biology has even mutated to change its mechanism of transmission [136, 137] ; therefore there are more publications supporting the position that the universe is a hologram [138] [139] [140] than blood borne viruses spontaneously becoming airborne transmittable. Such modeling would be difficult, but could include the average viral load of EVD patients (roughly 10 million) [141] multiplied by the total documented cases in history (31,079) [142] to get an estimate of the total interactions between an Ebola virion and the human host. This may support the estimate that historically, roughly 300 billion virion-host interactions have occurred without any reported airborne transmission. It is not our intention to proffer this 1 in 300 billion estimate as the definitive pre-test odds calculation, and any posttest assertions would have to account for viral turnover, predictions of undocumented cases, animal carriage, and other factors. While a more Bayesian approach [143, 144] would itself generate debate within the scientific community, a reporter attempting to make a last minute deadline would find more than just the terms \"possible\" or \"cannot be excluded\" as stand ins for every probability between impossible and almost certain. This may better communicate whether the current EVD control measures should be modified to address the chance of airborne spread by enumerating the remoteness of the risk for their readers.",

Data related to aerosolization of Ebola virus within a context of bio-warfare preparation present a different risk of misinterpretation when the context of the discussion shifts to that of outbreak response; efforts must therefore be made to present the actionable implications of the data within the new context.

These finding may also represent a potentially useful addition to news sourcing algorithms, such as those used by Facebook [150] , to preference media outlets with objective track records of accuracy and completeness. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between new and old media for the most popular news outlets. It would be intriguing to hypothesize if popularity of these sources is a reflection of their apparent dedication to accuracy that begets selective advantage in the marketplace, or if their built-brands afford them enough cover to avoid stereotypical 'click-bait' or sordid sensationalism.",

While the standard news pieces mostly erred in not specifically stating that bleeding is not a universal symptom of EVD, the letters and editorials misled by stating travel bans would be a net benefit, airborne spread is an actionable concern, and patients were contagious before being symptomatic (S2 Table) . While the alternative media articles used more apocalyptic verbiage, the basic themes of their errors did not differ from newspaper op-ed and letters.

However, the ease of accessibility of the media included did not predict the content or accuracy; newspaper articles covered in the New York Times did not differ significantly from the completely accessible Wall Street Journal except that the later contained editorials that carried an increased risk of erroneous statements. Furthermore, this study's use of objective mechanisms of collecting the lay press sources excluded some that are specialized for scientific information (such as Science News or Scientific American). An interesting follow up study could be to assess if these sciencefocused outlets were equal or superior to the outlets collected in this investigation. While this would not be conclusive, it does suggest that the large sample examined, while incomplete, was reflective of the whole. An additional major limitation is the inability to combine both qualitative and quantitate analysis in an objective manner. The binary scoring of the CERC system meant that articles that simply mentioned \"community outreach\" were given an equal score as those that detailed the types and benefits of such practices. It could be valuable to perform subsequent analysis re-scoring papers based on depth of each major topic, if this could be done in an objective fashion.",

However, this work may still achieve its goal of comparing the contemporaneous academic reviews available to reporters and policy makers at the time of their background research.

While this study in no suggests that the lay press was superior to academic works, the crux of our conclusions is that modern media access to academia makes it far more likely that a given academic author will be misunderstood. Writing within academia affords the ability to focus on novel findings and forego discussion of background knowledge that the author can safely assume the reader possesses. However, seclusion from the populace also carries a disadvantage of needing to rely upon the lay press to translate one's findings into that which is fit for consumption in the public sphere. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing an academia increasingly pressured to produce publications, combined with the demands of today's fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the traditional paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions.",
