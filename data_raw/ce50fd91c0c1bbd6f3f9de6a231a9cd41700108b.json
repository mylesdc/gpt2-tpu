            "text": "Phagocytes destroy ingested microbes by producing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from chloride ions (Cl \u2212 ) and hydrogen peroxide within phagolysosomes, using the enzyme myeloperoxidase. HOCl, the active ingredient in bleach, has antibacterial/antiviral properties. As myeloperoxidase is needed for HOCl production, non-myeloid cells are considered incapable of producing HOCl. Here, we show that epithelial, fibroblast and hepatic cells have enhanced antiviral activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). Replication of enveloped/non-enveloped, DNA (herpes simplex virus-1, murine gammaherpesvirus 68) and RNA (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, human coronavirus 229E, coxsackievirus B3) viruses are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Whilst treatment with sodium channel inhibitors did not prevent NaCl-mediated virus inhibition, a chloride channel inhibitor reversed inhibition by NaCl, suggesting intracellular chloride is required for antiviral activity. Inhibition is also reversed in the presence of 4-aminobenzoic hydrazide, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor, suggesting epithelial cells have a peroxidase to convert Cl \u2212 to HOCl. A significant increase in intracellular HOCl production is seen early in infection. These data suggest that non-myeloid cells possess an innate antiviral mechanism dependent on the availability of Cl \u2212 to produce HOCl. Antiviral activity against a broad range of viral infections can be augmented by increasing availability of NaCl.",

The NaCl concentrations shown are concentrations additional to the NaCl already present in media (110 mM) and not final concentrations. Cell viability was >70% at all concentrations tested, suggesting that the observed inhibitory effect was not caused by cytotoxicity (Fig. 1b) . To address the possibility of GFP fluorescence being inhibited in the presence of NaCl or by a metabolite, HSV-1 virus production was also measured by plaque forming assays. A clear dose-dependent reduction in plaque forming units was detected (Fig. 2a,b) . This confirms the viral inhibition seen in the GFP fluorescence assay is genuine.",

A reduction in viral replication is seen in the presence of increasing concentrations NaCl for all viruses tested (Fig. 3a-f ). The viability of A549, 3T3, and HuH-7.5 and HuH-7 cells are shown in Fig. 4 . There was a significant dose-dependent reduction of viral replication for HSV-1 (Fig. 3a , 80% reduction, p < 0.00001) and RSV (Fig. 3b , 86% reduction, p = 0.00001) seen at 100 mM NaCl over and above the concentration of NaCl in DMEM (110 mM). This concentration of NaCl is not cytotoxic to HeLa cells (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in replication of both HSV-1 and RSV in the presence of as little as 10 mM NaCl over and above the concentration of NaCl in DMEM. The pattern of inhibition by NaCl appears to be dependent on the virus and/or the cell type. MHV68 replication (3T3 cells) was only significantly inhibited at 100 mM of NaCl over and above the concentration in DMEM (Fig. 3c , p = 0.00006), a concentration that was not cytotoxic to 3T3 cells (Fig. 4b) . HCoV-229E and CV-B3 were both significantly inhibited from 30-50 mM NaCl over and above the concentration in DMEM (p < 0.01; Fig. 3d and e). However, as cell viability was very low at 100 mM NaCl in both HuH7 (HCoV-229E) and HuH7.5 (CV-B3) cells (5% and 37%, respectively; Fig. 4c and d) , inhibition of these viruses by NaCl should only be considered up to 50 mM NaCl. Finally, a dose-dependent reduction in viral replication was also seen for influenza A virus in A549 cells (Fig. 3f) . P-values were not calculated for influenza A virus as the experiment was only done once.",

More recent RNAseq (GTEx database) (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) and SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) (https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/) studies, however, have shown that MPO is also expressed at lower levels Figure 7 . HSV-1 is inhibited in the presence of NaCl by increased production of intracellular hypochlorous acid: HeLa cells were infected with non-GFP labelled HSV-1 at MOI 0.5 for 1 hour before treating with increasing concentrations of NaCl. After 6 hours, cells were washed and stained with 10 \u03bcM HCSe 8 (a BODIPYbased green fluorescent probe which is rapidly and specifically oxidized by HOCl to emit a fluorescence signal) or R-19S (a rhodamine fluorophore) 9 for 30 minutes. Fluorescence was measured after cells were washed twice with PBS. Fluorescence values were normalized to uninfected cells treated with the corresponding NaCl concentration. NaCl (mM) values are over and above that found in DMEM (110 mM). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of three biological replicates. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 when compared to 0 mM NaCl. Another possibility is that other enzymes could have a role similar to that of MPO. NADPH oxidase (Nox) and dual oxidase (Duox) are both members of the Nox and Duox family enzymes 13 . Five Nox and two Duox enzymes have been identified in humans, compared to one Nox and one Duox in Drosophila. Nox help in the production of superoxide anion. Duox have both the NADPH oxidase domain along with an extracellular peroxidase homology domain, a transmembrane domain, and a calcium modulated EF hand domain. Due to the presence of the peroxidase domain, Duox help convert H 2 O 2 to HOCl in the presence of Cl \u2212 in Drosophila and are thought to convert H 2 O 2 to hypothiocyanate (OSCN -) in the presence of thiocyanate anion (SCN -) in mucosal epithelium of mammals 13 . However in both these models, since Duox is only thought to be present on the apical membrane, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced is thought to be extracellular (i.e. into the fluid lining the gut or the respiratory tract) as demonstrated in 3D culture model of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells infected with influenza virus A (H1N1 and H3N2) 14 . Whist there was recovery of barrier integrity in NHBE cells after H1N1 infection, infection with H3N2 was associated with loss of barrier integrity and enhanced cell death 14 . Suppression of H 2 O 2 by catalase or GKT136901 led to increased viral RNA expression and viral particle release 14 . Both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses down regulated Duox 1 and dual oxidase maturation factor A1 (Duox A1). However Duox 2 and dual oxidase maturation factor A 2 (Duox A2) mRNA expression was significantly increased after H1N1 infection (which was less pathogenic in this model) and less so with H3N2 suggesting the conversion of H 2 O 2 to HOCl possibly reduced the pathogenicity of the H1N1 infection 14 . Infection with rhinovirus has also been reported to lead to an increase in Duox 2 expression 15 .",

The authors also reported that a Duox knock down mutant was incapable of producing intracellular HOCl 9 .

It has also been reported that the peroxidase component in Duox 2 is a heme peroxidase which is inhibited in the presence of sodium azide 14 . We used 4ABAH, a known myeloperoxidase inhibitor; and myeloperoxide is also a heme peroxidase 16, 17 . Whether 4ABAH also inhibits the heme peroxidase found in Duox 2 remains to be verified. There are also other mechanisms by which cells can produce HOCl. For example sea-urchins can produce HOCl from H 2 O 2 and NaCl in the presence of copper ions independent of MPO 18 .",

Recently, 214 vertebrate-associated RNA viruses have been identified in fish, amphibians and reptiles adding to the body of evidence 20, 21 . If co-evolution is true, it stands to reason that cells would have evolved to fight viral infections at an early stage (i.e. when life began in the marine environment), and potentially used the most commonly available resource -chlorine 22 . White leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), a euryhaline shrimp that can adapt and survive in a wide range of salinities, is known to get infected with white spot syndrome virus. Outbreaks of white spot syndrome virus are common in shrimp farms during the rainy season, with a possible association with lower salinity and temperatures. It has recently been reported that shrimp are more susceptible to white spot syndrome virus when the water is at a lower salinity, suggesting that chloride ions may have an antiviral effect in marine organisms as well 23 . This potential relationship between virus, eukaryotic co-evolution and antiviral mechanism is interesting and needs further research.",

Hence both sets of data support our view that non-myeloid cells make use of a source of chloride ions to produce HOCl which helps to fight viral infections. Our findings open the field to a new avenue of therapy based on harnessing this host immune defense mechanism. Supplying NaCl locally could also help treat other common illnesses such as the cold sores, genital herpes, and viral gastroenteritis. Upper respiratory tract infections could be cured before they become lower respiratory tract infections or cause exacerbations in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, etc. Even more exciting is the possibility of using this simple intervention as a prophylactic tool.

HeLa cells were seeded in black clear-bottomed 96 well plates at 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in 100 \u00b5l DMEM/5% FCS/1% PS and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C for cells to adhere. The next day, media was removed and cells infected with 25 \u00b5l media or HSV-1 SC16 110 lacZ 28 at MOI 0.5. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, inoculum was removed and replaced with 0, 25, 50, or 100 mM NaCl in phenol red-free medium. At 6 hours post-infection, cells were washed with 100 \u03bcl PBS, and 50 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM HCSe 8 (kindly provided by S. Wu) or R19-S 9 (Futurechem) solution was added per well. After 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark, wells were washed twice with 100 \u03bcl PBS and 50 \u03bcl of PBS added per well before fluorescence measured (excitation wavelength of 510 nm and emission wavelength of 542 nm). Fluorescence values were normalized to uninfected cells in the presence of corresponding concentrations of NaCl.",

Cells were infected with virus for 1 hour before virus was replaced with media containing increasing concentrations of NaCl.
