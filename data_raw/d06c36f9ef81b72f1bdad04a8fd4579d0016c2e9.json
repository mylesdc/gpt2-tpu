Therefore, a better understanding of the signals controlling migration of neutrophils as well as evaluating the role of these cells in demyelination is important to define cellular components that contribute to disease in MS patients. In this study, we examined the functional role of the chemokine CXCL1 in contributing to neuroinflammation and demyelination in EAE. Using transgenic mice in which expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter active within glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, we have shown that sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS increased the severity of clinical and histologic disease that was independent of an increase in the frequency of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Rather, disease was associated with enhanced recruitment of CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils into the spinal cord. Targeting neutrophils resulted in a reduction in demyelination arguing for a role for these cells in myelin damage. Collectively, these findings emphasize that CXCL1-mediated attraction of neutrophils into the CNS augments demyelination suggesting that this signaling pathway may offer new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Among the mechanisms by which myelin-reactive CD4 + T-cells contribute to disease is through localized secretion of cytokines, e.g. IL-17 that increases expression of chemokines that attract myeloid cells into the CNS [8] . Monocytes and macrophages amplify white matter damage through active stripping of the myelin sheath leading to axonal damage, presentation of novel myelin epitopes to T cells and amplifying neuroinflammation through secretion of proinflammatory molecules. In addition, IL-17 secretion increases expression of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2 resulting in recruitment and accumulation of these cells within the CNS [9] .",

            "text": "Given the transient nature of neutrophils in terms of having a short half-life, limited presence within lesions, and tightly regulated expression of chemotactic signals underscores the challenging aspects involved in understanding the role of these cells in autoimmune demyelination. To overcome some of these limitations, we have derived a transgenic mouse whereby expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter that is active within glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes [21] . Recent studies have emphasized an important role for CXCL1 and it is receptor CXCR2 during the effector phase of EAE [9, [22] [23] [24] . Although resident cells of the CNS including microglia and endothelial cells express CXCL1 [24, 25] , astrocytes have been shown to express CXCL1 in EAE as well as in MS lesions [26] [27] [28] and this informed our decision to select astrocytes as our target cell for ectopic expression of CXCL1. Our present study was undertaken to better understand how elevated and sustained neutrophil recruitment into the CNS impacts EAE disease progression and white matter damage. Our findings indicate that increased expression of CXCL1 within the CNS results in more severe EAE as measured by both clinical disease and demyelination. The CXCL1mediated disease enhancement was not dependent on an increase in myelin-reactive Th1 or Th17 cells but correlated with increased numbers of neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord. Indeed, depletion of neutrophils resulted in a reduction in the severity of white matter damage highlighting a role for these cells in demyelination.",

The accumulation of neutrophils in the CNS is rapid yet transient and reflects the expression kinetics of CXCL1 and CXCL2. To better understand how neutrophil infiltration impacts demyelination and disease progression in EAE, transgenic (tg) mice were engineered to express CXCL1 within GFAP-positive astrocytes upon doxycycline administration, as previous studies have shown these cells to be the primary source of CXCL1 in models of neuroinflammation [29, 30] . Doxycyline (Dox) responsive double tg mice (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA) or single tg controls lacking the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) were immunized with MOG peptide and treated daily with Dox (50 mg/kg) i.p. between days 9 through 19 postimmunization (Fig. 1A) . Onset of clinical disease was similar between Dox-treated double tg and single tg mice (day 9 p.i.), but double tg mice exhibited a significant increase in clinical disease severity compared to single tg mice (Fig. 1B) . Examination of mRNA transcripts encoding proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines indicated a selective >twofold increase in CXCL1 in Dox-treated double tg mice versus single tg mice at day 12 postimmunization that represents a time in which there is a separation in clinical disease between double and single tg mice following MOG 35-55 immunization. No differences in expression of transcripts encoding CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17A at day 12 between Doxtreated double tg and single tg mice were observed (Fig. 1C) . A significant (p < 0.05) increase in CXCL1 protein was detected only in the spinal cord (Fig. 1E) and not in the serum (Fig. 1D ) of double tg mice 12 days postimmunization compared to single tg controls. Notably, we also observed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in CXCL1 protein within the spinal cords of Dox-treated na\u00efve mice in which EAE was not induced indicating that disease induction did not selectively enhance transgene expression (Fig. 1E) . We did not detect differences in proteins levels of G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-17 (data not shown) either prior to or following Dox treatment of double tg or single tg EAE mice. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed astrocytes (GFAP+) as the primary cellular source of CXCL1 in Dox-treated double tg EAE mice (Fig. 1F ). Together, these findings indicate that CXCL1 expression was specifically elevated in the CNS of Dox-treated double tg mice that correlated with an increase in clinical disease.",

We next investigated whether Dox-induced overexpression of CXCL1 promotes neutrophil accumulation in double tg mice induced with EAE. Histopathologic examination of spinal cord sections revealed increased localization of inflammatory cells in the anterior median fissure and meninges of the spinal cords of Dox-treated double tg mice compared to single tg EAE mice (Fig. 4A ). The majority of inflammatory cells within spinal cords of double tg mice had a multilobed nucleus characteristic of neutrophils (Fig. 4B ). Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased numbers of cells positive for the neutrophil-associated surface antigen Ly6B.2 within the spinal cords of Dox-treated double tg EAE mice compared to single tg mice treated with Dox (Fig. 4C ). In addition, flow analysis of spinal cords isolated from experimental mice indicated the frequency and numbers of neutrophils (CD45 hi CD11b + Ly6G + ) within the spinal cords of Dox-treated double tg mice were significantly (p < 0.01) increased compared to single tg mice ( Fig. 4D and E) . Importantly, we did not observe an increase in Ly6C+ monocytes in either brain or spinal cords of double tg mice treated with Dox (data not shown). Together, these findings argue that the Dox-induced increase in CXCL1 expression within the CNS enhances the recruitment and accumulation of neutrophils within the spinal cords associated increased clinical disease severity. Using a model of viral-induced demyelination, we have previously shown that Doxinduced CXCL1 expression within the CNS increases the severity of white matter damage and this was correlated with enhanced neutrophil recruitment into the spinal cord [21] . Assessment of spinal cord pathology between Dox-treated single tg and double tg mice was assessed using H&E/LFB staining at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 4F) . We recorded an increase in both meningeal infiltration (p < 0.05) and demyelination (p < 0.05) of double tg compared to single tg was observed (Fig. 4G ). . Dox-induced CXCL1 within the CNS does not increase microglia/macrophage activation. Doxtreated double and single tg mice were sacrificed at day 12 following MOG immunization and spinal cords removed to assess macrophage (CD45 hi F4/80 + ) (A) and microglia (CD45 lo F4/80 + ) (B) activation via flow cytometric staining between double tg (n = 10) or single tg (n = 10) mice. The gating scheme employed is depicted in Supporting Information Fig. S3 . Surface expression of activation markers MHC class II and CD80 was also examined on macrophages (C) or microglia (D) between double tg (n = 7) and single tg (n = 7) mice. Data in panels A and B were pooled from three independent experiments; data in panels C and D from two independent experiments.

Anti-CXCR2 or NRS was administered to Dox-treated double tg mice at defined times following EAE induction (Fig. 5A) . Administration of anti-CXCR2 antisera to Dox-treated double tg mice resulted in a dramatic reduction in clinical disease severity compared to animals treated with NRS alone (Fig. 5B) and this was correlated with reduced numbers of circulating CD45 hi CD11b + Ly6C + Ly6G + neutrophils (Fig. 5C ). The reduction in clinical disease in Dox-treated double tg mice treated with anti-CXCR2 correlated with a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the severity of demyelination compared to NRS-treated mice (Fig. 5D and E) and this was associated with reduced numbers of neutrophils present within the spinal cords ( Fig. 5F and G) . Together, these findings indicate that neutrophils can enhance the severity of demyelination in MOG 35-55 -induced EAE.",

The importance of these cells to disease is highlighted in that FDA-approved disease modifying therapies used in treatment of relapsing remitting MS limit immune cell infiltration and lesion development [34, 35] . Nonetheless, there is increasing interest in the potential role of other cell types, including neutrophils, in participating in demyelination. The diverse functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis, release of toxic granules, and secretion of ROS, nitrogen species, and neutrophil extracellular traps that can lead to bacterial clearance and tissue damage [36] [37] [38] [39] . In addition, neutrophils can produce many different cytokines and chemokines that participate in tailoring the immune response as well as enhancing neuroinflammation [36] [37] [38] [39] . Although there is direct evidence that neutrophils are important in both disease initiation and progression in EAE models only indirect evidence exists showing these cells also play a role in MS pathogenesis [40] . Since neutrophils are typically short-lived and have a half-life in circulation (between 6 and 8 hours in humans) [41] , direct evidence of neutrophils in MS lesions from available autopsy tissue samples has been limited. Nonetheless, recent studies from Segal and colleagues [12] have demonstrated increased systemic levels of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL5 as well as neutrophil elastase that correlated with lesion burden and clinical disability in MS patients arguing for a role for neutrophils in augmenting disease.",

CXCL1 is a member of the ELR (+) family of CXC chemokines and binds with high affinity to the chemokine receptor CXCR2 [11, 42] . Neutrophils express CXCR2 and signaling enhances egress out of the BM and aids in homing to sites of inflammation [36] . In the context of EAE, CXCL1 is detected early in the CNS [24] both prior to and following disease onset [12] . Mice treated with anti-CXCL1 blocking antibody showed a delayed onset of disease and decreased clinical disease correlating with diminished numbers of Ly6G + neutrophils yet CNS T-cell infiltration was not affected arguing for a role for neutrophils in disease [24] . Similarly, a better understanding of molecules, e.g. CXCL1 that influence neutrophil accu-mulation within the CNS also allows insight into the therapeutic relevance of these potential targets. Lira et al. [43] have previously shown that transgenic mice in which CXCL1 was constitutively expressed from oligodendrocytes led to the development of neurologic disease associated with microglia and astrocyte reactivity that correlated with increase in neutrophil accumulation within the brain. Using the animals described in this study in which transgenic Cxcl1 is selectively expressed in astrocytes upon Doxycycline treatment, we recently showed that increased and sustained expression of CXCL1 was associated with increased clinical disease and demyelination in animals infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) [21] . Enhanced clinical and histologic disease correlated with a dramatic increase in neutrophil infiltration into the CNS; targeted ablation of neutrophils resulted in a reduction in the severity of demyelination further supporting an important role for neutrophils in augmenting white matter damage [21] .",

Similar to our previous report using JHMV infection of CXCL1 double transgenic mice [21] , we found that Dox administration resulted in elevated CXCL1 transgene expression within the brains and spinal cords of double tg mice that was restricted to astrocytes and correlated with rapid and robust neutrophil migration to the CNS compared to Dox-treated controls. As a result of CXCL1 transgene expression, MOG 35-55 -immunized double tg mice displayed sustained increase in clinical disease severity. Increased accumulation of neutrophils in the CNS did not affect the expression of proinflammatory factors that could potentially attract inflammatory leukocytes and/or increase numbers of resident glial cells. Indeed, we observed no statistical difference in the frequencies or numbers of either activated macrophages or microglia expressing MHC class II and CD80 between Dox-treated double tg and single tg mice. Furthermore, we did not detect any increase in either frequency or numbers of CNS inflammatory CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in Dox-treated double tg mice compared to Dox-treated single tg mice. In addition, there were no differences in the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and/or IL-17A by CD4 + T-cells between Dox-treated double and single tg mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that the increase in MOG 35-55 -induced clinical disease upon Dox-induced CXCL1 expression is not the result of increased infiltration/activation of either macrophages/microglia or T cells. Of additional interest is our observation that Dox-treatment of na\u00efve double tg mice resulted in increased expression of CXCL1 within the CNS and these findings argue that induction of EAE is dispensable in terms increased expression of this transgene. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are determining if sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS is sufficient to contribute to demyelination mediated by neutrophil accumulation in the absence of MOG immunization.",

This difference in results most likely reflects that the Cxcl1 transgene employed in our study was lacking the 3' UTR resulting in an increase in the half-life of CXCL1 mRNA and therefore sustained CXCL1 production and subsequently neutrophil accumulation whereas Omari et al. was using a transgene containing the 3'UTR and nonsustained expression of CXCL1 [44] . We do not believe CXCL1 had any direct cytotoxic activity on oligodendroglia as we have previous shown that treatment of differentiating mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells with recombinant CXCL1 does not kill these cells [45] . Rather, our findings argue that increased white matter damage is associated with a selective increase in neutrophil accumulation within the CNS and this is consistent with earlier studies from our laboratory using the CXCL1 transgenic animals in a model of viral-induced neurologic disease [21] . Although recent studies suggest that Ly-6C+ myeloid precursor cells play a pathogenic role during autoimmune demyelination [46] , our findings reveal that the increase in tissue damage was not the result of enhanced migration of these cells to the CNS of Dox-treated double tg mice when compared to single tg mice. Molecules that neutrophils are known to possess that potentially could impact cell survival include neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and matrix metalloproteinases [39] . Indeed, neutrophils have clearly been shown to exacerbate brain injury in a model of focal cerebral ischemia [47] . Blocking neutrophil trafficking to the CNS or inhibition of the NAPDH complex in mouse models of ischemic injury results in a dramatic reduction in both the vascular endothelium and brain parenchyma [47, 48] . Moreover, both the generation of ROS and nitric oxide is thought to contribute to vascular damage as well as impact axonal integrity and oligodendrocyte viability [49, 50] . Neutrophils are also implicated in exacerbating lesion development within spinal cords on patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) [51] , and inhibition of neutrophil elastase, a serine protease released from the primary granules of neutrophils, within mouse models of NMO resulted in reduced neuroinflammation and myelin loss [52, 53] . Within the EAE model of chronic neurologic disease, neutrophils have recently been reported to have a role in maturating local APCs within the CNS thus potentially contributing to increased disease severity by increasing numbers of autoreactive T cells [54] . However, we believe it unlikely that the increase in disease severity is the result of enhanced macrophages presenting antigen as we determined there was no increase in either activated macrophage or microglia in the CNS of Dox-treated double tg mice nor were there increases in either Th1 and/or Th17 CD4 + T-cell responses.",

To generate double transgenic (tg) mice, hemizygous pBI-CXCL1 transgenics were crossed to hemizygous GFAP-rtTA*M2 mice (JAX), resulting in double transgenic mice (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA), single tg (rtTA-GFAP or pBI-CXCL1) or WT.

(F) Representative immunofluorescent staining for neutrophils (Ly6B.2) reveals fewer positive cells within the spinal cords of anti-CXCR2-treated mice compared to NRS-treated mice. (G) Quantification of spinal cord Ly6B.2-positive neutrophils reveals reduced numbers in anti-CXCR2-treated mice (n = 3) compared to NRS-treated mice (n = 3); data derived from two independent experiments presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.",
