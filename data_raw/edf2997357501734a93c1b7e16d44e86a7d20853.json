They have demonstrated higher susceptibility to a wider variety of human pathogens than other rodents and are also the animal model of choice for pre-clinical evaluations of some vaccine candidates. However, the genome of cotton rats remains to be fully sequenced, with much fewer genes cloned and characterised compared to other rodent species. Here we report the cloning and characterization of CD40 ligand, whose human and murine counterparts are known to be expressed on a range of cell types including activated T cells and B cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, macrophages and platelets and exerts a broad array of immune responses. The cDNA for cotton rat CD40L we isolated is comprised of 1104 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 783bp coding for a 260 amino acid protein. The recombinant cotton rat CD40L protein was recognized by an antibody against mouse CD40L. Moreover, it demonstrated functional activities on immature bone marrow dendritic cells by upregulating surface maturation markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86), and increasing IL-6 gene and protein expression. The availability of CD40L gene identity could greatly facilitate mechanistic research on pathogen-induced-immunopathogenesis and vaccine-elicited immune responses.",

            "text": "The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) was first used in polio research in the 1930s [1] , and throughout the last century, it has proven to be an excellent model for biomedical research [2, 3, 4] . Historically in biomedical research, the mouse has been exploited as the default animal model. This is in part due to its well defined immunological and genetic information, costeffectiveness, and abundant inbred strains and research reagents. However, the use of mice as models to study infectious diseases has its limitation since mice are not naturally infected by most human pathogens. On the other hand, cotton rat is susceptible to many human pathogens and is the ideal model of choice for measles (paramyxovirus) [5] , herpes simplex (oral a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 and ophthalmic) [6] , influenza (orthomyxovirus) [7, 8] , HIV-1 [9] , RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) [10] , adenovirus [11, 12] , human parainfluenza [13] , and human metapneumovirus [14] . This model has been valuable for adenovirus-based gene replacement therapy research [15, 16] , and was also proven to be indispensable in pre-clinical evaluation of the prophylactic antibodies (RespiGam 1 [17] , and Synagis 1 [18] . Indeed, the cotton rat model was found to be valuable in terms of its biological and immunological relevance, it was deemed unnecessary to test the adenovirus-based gene therapy and the Synagis 1 prophylactic treatment against RSV disease in non-human primate prior to the human trials [19, 20] .",

Moreover, when CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of DCs, it promotes cytokine production, the induction of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules, and facilitates the cross-presentation of antigen by these cells [27] , enabling DCs to mature and effectively induce the activation and differentiation of T cells. When CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of B cells, it promotes germinal center formation, immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching, somatic hypermutation to enhance antigen affinity, and lastly, the formation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells [28] .Various studies have been conducted to utilize gene delivery of CD40L to DCs and tumor cells for tumor immunotherapy. It was found that expression of CD40L in a small proportion of tumor cells was sufficient to generate a long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immune response in mice that was shown to be dependent on cytotoxic T lymphocytes [29, 30] .",

The TNF superfamily is composed of 19 ligands and 29 receptors, in which each has vastly diversified roles in the body and exhibit pro-inflammatory activity, partly via activation of NF-kB [37] . Members of this family generally have an intracellular N-terminal domain, a short transmembrane segment, an extracellular stalk, and a globular TNF-like extracellular domain of about 150 residues [23] . They initiate apoptosis by binding to related receptors, some of which have intracellular death domains [38] . These proteins typically form homo-or hetero-trimeric complexes and bind one elongated receptor molecule along each of three clefts formed by neighboring monomers of the trimer and ligand trimerization is for receptor binding [23, 39] . All seven known conserved residues that constitute the trimer interface on the conserved TNF domain [23, 40] , were mapped to the putative crCD40L protein sequence. Additionally, all six known conserved receptor binding sites on the conserved TNF domain [23, 40] , were mapped to the crCD40L protein sequence.",

The crCD40L construct was designed to carry a secretion signal, histidine tag, and a trimerization motif (Fig 4a) . Selection and purification of the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the CD40L construct was conducted in BHK21 cells. Western blot with anti-histidine antibody (Ab) was used to confirm expression of the CD40L protein construct Fig 4b and S2 Fig. The resulting 36 kDa protein product was found in both the cell lysate and supernatant (faint band-48 hours only). Since the highest expression was found in the cell lysate, it was used for further purification of the protein. It should be noted that the protein was only able to be detected under reducing conditions. Under non-reducing conditions, the protein was unable to be detected by the anti-histidine Ab, even in the cell lysate (data not shown). This indicates that the histidine tag is folded within the trimer and is unavailable in the native form for purification. This is an additional reason for the need to purify the protein from the cell lysate under harsh denaturing conditions followed by protein refolding. The reason we utilized a mammalian expression system to produce the protein rather than a bacterial system is to facilitate its proper folding into its native structure, trimerization, and glycosylation. The aa backbone predicts a protein of 29 kDa, yet initial studies of the CD40L protein suggested a molecular mass of 39 kDa, and on most cell types the molecular mass of CD40L is 32-33kDa, consistent with extensive post-translation modification [36] .",

Uncoated controls were performed in parallel and were negative for CD40L in ELISA. We measured the overall strength of the antigen-antibody complex in the presence of 6M urea [41] . The avidity of the cotton rat CD40L for the anti-mouse CD40L antibody was decreased in the presence of 6M urea at all concentrations. Clearly, as the antibody used was raised against mouse CD40L, the crCD40L is detected by mouse CD40L. crCD40L was expressed in vaccinia virus and purified from infected BHK21 cell lysate on a nickel column. The purified protein was detected by ELISA using a mouse antibody against CD40L in a concentration gradient dependent manner. The avidity of the mouse CD40L antibody to the cotton rat CD40L protein was evaluated in the presence of 6M urea. The difference between the untreated and 6M urea treated for each group was calculated using students t-test \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p<0.001, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p<0.0001 (n = 2).

            "text": "Since the cotton rat CD40L protein sequence shared 82% identity with the mouse CD40L protein sequence with similar functional domains, we evaluated the biological activity of the recombinant crCD40L on immature murine bone marrow DCs. We conducted experiments based on known functional activities of CD40L in other animal species. Specifically, maturation of immature DCs after exposure to antigen is known to play a crucial role in their immunity-stimulating function [36] , while trimeric recombinant CD40L has been shown to stimulate DC immunomodulating functions [42] . When CD40L engages CD40 on the surface of DCs, it promotes cytokine production, the induction of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules, and facilitates the cross-presentation of antigen by these cells [27] . In addition, CD11c is a DC integrin marker and upon stimulation, is down-regulated [43] . Intracellular adhesion marker CD54, along with co-stimulatory markers CD40, CD80, and CD86 are all upregulated upon stimulation with CD40L [44, 45] . Moreover, mouse I-A d major histocompatibility complex is also up-regulated upon stimulation with CD40L [45] . When our recombinant crCD40L was used to stimulate immature murine bone marrow DCs, we observed similar results to that when murine CD40L is used (Tables 1 and 2 ). CD11c was down regulated in both median flouresence intensity (Table 1 ) and the percentage of positive cells ( Table 2 ). The co-stimulatory molecules CD54, CD40, CD80, and CD86 were all up-regulated in both median fluorescence intensity (Table 1 ) and the percentage of positive cells ( Table 2 ). The Mouse I-A d major histocompatibility complex was upregulated in median fluorescence intensity (Table 1) but not up-regulated in terms of the overall percentage of positive cells (Table 2) . We speculate this to be due to the species incompatibility since we are stimulating mouse bone marrow cells with cotton rat CD40L. Nevertheless, the crCD40L was able to promote up-regulation of key co-stimulatory markers on immature DCs promoting DC maturation. The gating strategy used for the flow cytometry analysis is provided in S3 Fig along with overlapping histograms of the intracellular adhesion marker and co-stimulatory markers. CD40-induced activation of cytokine gene expression in DCs by CD40L is an important process in the initiation of primary immune responses and is critical for DC maturation and the generation of antigen-specific T cell responses [46] . IL-6 is a highly pleiotropic cytokine in that it stimulates the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells, and furthermore, modifies DC function and survival [47] [48] [49] [50] . We tested if the recombinant crCD40L could induce IL-6 gene expression (Fig 6a) and production of the cytokine (Fig 6b) by immature murine bone marrow DCs. The results indicate that a significant increase in both IL-6 gene expression and cytokine production in immature murine bone marrow DCs was observed forty hours after stimulation with the crCD40L. Collectively, the observation that both the upregulation of immature DC cell surface maturation markers and increased IL-6 gene expression and cytokine production provide strong evidence of the biological activity of crCD40L.",

Rat (Rattus norvegicus UniProt: Q9Z2V2), Mouse (Mus musculus UniProt: P27548), Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus NCBI Reference Sequence: XM_005084522.3), and Deer Mouse Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii (NCBI Reference Sequence: XP_006992033). An \u00c3 (asterisk) indicates positions which have a single, fully conserved residue. A: (colon) indicates conservation between groups of strongly similar properties-scoring > 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix. A. (period) indicates conservation between groups of weakly similar properties-scoring = < 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix. (B) Alignment tree was produced using Geneosis software and multiple alignment was conducted with phylogenetic analysis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199067.g002 domain (aa 137-260) and a 23 aa putative transmembrane domain (aa 23-45). Amino acids 124, 169, 171, 223, 228, 254, and 258 comprise the putative trimer interface, while amino acids 140, 141, 146, 189, 196, and 200 comprise the putative receptor binding sites.",

The purified protein was detected by ELISA using a mouse antibody against CD40L in a concentration gradient dependent manner. The avidity of the mouse CD40L antibody to the cotton rat CD40L protein was evaluated in the presence of 6M urea. The difference between the untreated and 6M urea treated for each group was calculated using students t-test \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p<0.001, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p<0.0001 (n = 2).
