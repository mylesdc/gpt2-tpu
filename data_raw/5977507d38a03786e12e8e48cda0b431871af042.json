            "text": "Background: Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent in the family Paramyxoviridae that is maintained in nature by bats. Outbreaks have occurred in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh and have been associated with 40 to 75% case fatality rates. There are currently no vaccines or postexposure treatments licensed for combating human NiV infection. Methods and results: Four groups of ferrets received a single vaccination with different recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing: Group 1, control with no glycoprotein; Group 2, the NiV fusion protein (F); Group 3, the NiV attachment protein (G); and Group 4, a combination of the NiV F and G proteins. Animals were challenged intranasally with NiV 28 days after vaccination. Control ferrets in Group 1 showed characteristic clinical signs of NiV disease including respiratory distress, neurological disorders, viral load in blood and tissues, and gross lesions and antigen in target tissues; all animals in this group succumbed to infection by day 8. Importantly, all specifically vaccinated ferrets in Groups 2-4 showed no evidence of clinical illness and survived challenged. All animals in these groups developed anti-NiV F and/or G IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. While NiV RNA was detected in blood at day 6 post challenge in animals from Groups 2-4, the levels were orders of magnitude lower than animals from control Group 1. Conclusions: These data show protective efficacy against NiV in a relevant model of human infection. Further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective single injection vaccines for NiV infection.",

These viruses are categorized as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with disease and the lack of approved vaccines and therapeutics for human use. The primary reservoir for henipaviruses are bats of the genus Pteropus [2] ; however; the viruses can be transmitted to many mammalian species including humans. Currently, there are two distinct strains of NiV: 1) the Malaysia strain (NiV M ) discovered in 1999 during an outbreak on pig farms which resulted in spread to humans [3] ; and 2) the Bangladesh strain (NiV B ), which was discovered in India and Bangladesh during 2001 [4] . NiV B has been linked to direct transmission from bats to humans and evidence suggests human to human transmission is possible [5] .",

To date, there have been four experimental preventive candidate vaccines against henipaviruses evaluated in animal models. Vaccinia and canarypox viruses encoding the NiV M glycoproteins have shown protection against NiV M in hamsters and pigs [7, 8] . A recombinant adeno-associated vaccine expressing the NiV M G protein completely protected hamsters against homologous NiV M challenge and protected 50% of animals against heterologous HeV infection [9] . In addition, a recombinant subunit vaccine based on the HeV G protein (sG HeV ) completely protects small animals against lethal HeV and NiV M infection [10] [11] [12] [13] and more recently was shown to be efficacious in the robust African green monkey model of NiV M infection [14] . Though very promising, the sG HeV vaccine requires a prime-boost strategy to confer protection whereas a single-injection vaccine would be particularly beneficial during outbreaks where there is little time to employ lengthy vaccination regimens.",

            "text": "To investigate the protective efficacy of rVSV NiV B vaccine vectors against heterologous NiV M challenge in ferrets, we first developed and recovered two rVSV\u0394G constructs expressing the NiV B F protein rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B / F-GFP ( Figure 1A , blue) or NiV B G protein rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /G-GFP ( Figure 1A , yellow) using reverse genetics. Propagation of these vectors requires VSV glycoprotein (G Ind ) complementation (G Ind *) of viruses where G Ind is provided in trans during infection [33] . G Ind * complementation allows for single-cycle replication of vectors and results in expression of the NiV B glycoproteins and the production non-infectious virions containing either glycoprotein. As seen previously with similar NiV M rVSV vectors [28] , co-infection with G Ind * rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F-GFP and G Ind * rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /G-GFP produced infectious virions (rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F/G-GFP) containing either genome with the NiV B F and NiV B G proteins incorporated in the virion envelope ( Figure 1A , Group 4 green-spiked virion) as evidenced by the ability of these virus preparations to infect Vero cells ( Figure 1B , *) and the inability of the rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F-GFP and rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /G-GFP to infect cells without G Ind * complementation (negative data not shown). The rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F/G-GFP virus stocks were able to reach titers of up to 3 \u00d7 10 8 PFU/ml and infection of Vero cells with these stocks resulted in syncytia formation ( Figure 1B ). While this vaccine preparation could undergo a single round of replication, it could not be passaged further without G Ind * complementation as was observed with the rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F-GFP and rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /G-GFP vaccine preparations.",

Serum collected from each animal on the day of vaccination (day -28) and just before challenge (day 0) was analyzed for circulating IgG to the NiV F and NiV G proteins by microsphere assay [30] . As expected, we did not detect NiV F-specific Ig in sera before vaccination ( Figure 2B , day -28). We were able to detect Ig directed at NiV F in sera of the Group 2 and 4 vaccinated cohorts 28 days after vaccination but not in the ferrets from Groups 1 and 3 ( Figure 2B , day 0). Similar to the analysis of NiV F-specific circulating IgG in vaccinated ferrets, we were unable to detect IgG directed to NiV G before vaccination ( Figure 2C , day -28) and were able to detect anti-NiV G IgG 28 days post vaccination ( Figure 2C , day -28). Animals in Group 3 had higher levels of circulating anti-NiV G IgG when compared to Group 4 and surprisingly we were able to detect anti-NiV G IgG in Group 2 animals although not to the levels of the NiV B G-specifically vaccinated Group 3 animals ( Figure 2C , day -0). These results suggested that the animals in Groups 2-4 and not Group 1 had generated a humoral immune response to the rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B antigens delivered in a single injection.",

The animals were closely monitored over the course of 22 days post challenge (p.c.) for clinical signs of illness. The specifically vaccinated animals in Groups 2-4 did not lose weight over the course of the study ( Figure 3A ) and were 100% protected against NiV M ( Figure 3B ), while the animals in the non-specifically vaccinated Group 1 succumbed to infection on days 7 or 8 ( Figure 2A ,^), respectively ( Figure 3B , Table 1 ). Clinical scores were recorded each day after challenge for each animal using a scoring system based on coat grooming, social behavior, and provoked behavior. The clinical scores for each animal correlated with the survival data as seen with the mean clinical score for each animal in the vaccinated groups having no score on any day p.c. versus the animals in Group 1 having clinical scores on days 5 to 8 p.c. Clinical signs in response to NiV B infection were more dramatic for the animals in Groups 1 when compared to the animals in the other three groups (Table 1 ). In all animals that succumbed to NiV M infection, the gross pathologic findings included varying severity of dehydration, ventral cervical subcutaneous hemorrhage with edema ( Figure 4A ) and crusting serous nasal discharge ( Figure 4B ). The internal gross pathologic findings from animals in Group 1 included varying severity of heavy, wet, diffusely mottled with dark pin point foci throughout the pulmonary parenchyma, multifocal pin point raised foci throughout the renal parenchyma, mottling of the spleen with diffuse splenomegaly, and diffuse reticulation of the liver. Each animal had diffuse hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia ( Figure 4C ) and splenomegaly with multifocal necrosis (pic 4D, *). Additionally, diffuse reticulation of the liver ( Figure 4D , +) and multifocal renal hemorrhage ( Figure 4D , arrow) were noted. There were no external or internal gross pathologic findings of note in any of the Group 2-4 animals at the study endpoint ( Figure 2A , day 22^).",

However, none of the specifically vaccinated animals had any detectable NiV M RNA in terminal blood samples on day 21 ( Figure 6A ). NiV M RNA was also detected systemically in the tissues of all animals that succumbed to infection in control Group 1 and in the spleen of one animal from Group 4 on the study end date ( Figure 6B ), though no NiV M antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry (data not shown), whereas NiV M RNA was not detected in the tissues of the remaining animals in Groups 2-4. Additionally, we were able to isolate NiV M from all tissues sampled in all animals from control Group 1, with the exception of the liver for animal 1-3 ( Figure 6C ). Overall, the level of detection of NiV M RNA in tissues and blood correlated with outcome gross pathology, and histology ( Figure 4 , Figure 5 , and Table 1 ) for each animal.",

All four groups lacked neutralizing antibody titers before vaccination ( Figure 7A ). On the day of challenge, animals from control Group 1 did not have neutralizing antibody titers against NiV M whereas all ferrets from Groups 2-4 had neutralizing antibodies against NiV M ( Figure 7B ), although it appeared that Groups 2 and 3 had higher titers than Group 4. Neutralizing antibody titers were also assessed for all animals from terminal bleeds on the day of death (day 7 or 8) or at day 21.

            "text": "While significant progress on a veterinary vaccine for one henipavirus, HeV, has been made [34] , the development of effective human vaccines and antiviral drugs for high consequence pathogens such as NiV is a much slower and complicated process. In particular, the restriction of infectious NiV work to BSL-4 containment has hampered progress. Conventional clinical trials with viruses such as NiV are not practical. To address the development of countermeasures for exotic pathogens such as NiV the FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical. Briefly, this rule permits the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data generated from studies performed in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease. There are currently at least eight animal models for NiV including the IFNAR-KO mouse model [35] ; the guinea pig model [36] ; the pig model [8, [37] [38] [39] ; the cat model [10, 11] ; the golden Syrian hamster model [7, [40] [41] [42] ; the ferret model [30, 43] ; and two nonhuman primate models, one in squirrel monkeys [44] and the other in African green monkeys [32] . While each of these models shares at least one or more aspects seen in human pathogenesis and can contribute to vaccine and therapeutic testing, the two animal models which completely emulate the pathogenesis seen in human cases to date are the ferret model and the African green monkey model. These models recapitulate what is seen during human infection with severe respiratory and neurologic disease and a generalized vasculitis.",

Animals in Group 2 vaccinated with G Ind * rVSV-\u0394G-NiV B /F-GFP generated anti-NiV F IgGs (and possible cross-reactive NiV G IgG, Figure 2C ) and neutralizing antibody titers against NiV M and were protected from NiV M -induced disease with one animal (Table 1 , 2-5) having a low-grade fever on day 7 p.c.

While multi-dose vaccine regimens would be feasible for laboratory and healthcare workers and some military personnel in stable settings with defined risk, an outbreak setting or a case of deliberate release would require rapidly conferred protection with a single administration. Here we describe the protection of ferrets from NiV M -induced disease using singleinjection rVSV vaccine vectors expressing the NiV B F and/ or NiV B G proteins. To date, this is the first study to show efficacy of a vaccine against NiV using a single administration in the ferret model. Based on the success of this study, these vectors should be evaluated further in the African green monkey model against NiV B challenge as this strain appears to be the most pathogenic in humans [6] .",
