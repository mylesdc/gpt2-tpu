All individuals are initially susceptible to infection (S). Once infected, they enter a latent incubation stage (E), from which they transition to become infectious, but not yet symptomatic (I 0 ). At the point of developing symptoms (I), their infectiousness increases.

In summary, while these interventions provide modest reductions in the frequency of uncontrolled outbreaks in some scenarios, they confer limited benefit compared to the behavioural interventions (reduction in transmission associated with community contacts and dead bodies) reported in the manuscript. In the absence of any intervention (\"None\"), uncontrolled outbreaks rarely occur if case ascertainment is 50%; the interventions are able to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks in these circumstances. The interventions provide little benefit when case ascertainment is 40%, and provide negligible benefit when case ascertainment is 30% or lower. By sampling the number of secondary cases from a Poisson distribution, the model presented here may under-estimate the actual variation in the number of secondary cases [1] . We can instead sample the number of secondary cases using probability distributions with means defined by the deterministic model equations (presented above) but which are over-dispersed with respect to the Poisson. The negative binomial distribution is frequently used in ecology and epidemiology, because it allows the mean and variance to be controlled independently.",

We re-ran the model simulations for the urban population of Port Moresby, where the force of infection was reduced in the community and/or from dead bodies for these same values: k = 10 (Figure 10 ), k = 1 ( Figure 11 ) and k = 0.1 (Figure 12 ).
