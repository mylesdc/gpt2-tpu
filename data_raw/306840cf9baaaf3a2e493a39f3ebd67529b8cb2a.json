Coronavirus envelope proteins specifically recognized the open APN form, prevented ectodomain progression to the closed form and substrate hydrolysis. In addition, drugs that bind the active site inhibited both coronavirus binding to cell surface APN and infection; the drugs probably hindered APN transition to the virusspecific open form. We conclude that allosteric inhibition of APN functions occurs by ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary for catalysis and virus cell entry, as validated by locking APN with disulfides. Blocking APN dynamics can thus be a valuable approach to development of drugs that target this ectoenzyme.",

It is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that hydrolyzes the N terminus of biological peptides and extracellular matrix proteins. APN-mediated peptide hydrolysis and activation is important for regulation of several physiological processes, such as the control of blood pressure (angiotensins) or cell chemotaxis. In addition, APN is linked to cell motility and tumor metastasis. APN is overexpressed in the neovasculature, including tumor blood vessels; its relevance in angiogenesis was discovered using NGR peptides and was later confirmed in animal models 7,11 . Peptides and inhibitors target APN overexpressed in tumors, and prevent tumor cell growth and invasion 12,13 ; drugs that bind to the active site of this protein have been developed to treat tumors and some are in clinical trials 10 . In addition to its association with angiogenesis and cancer, APN is a major coronavirus (CoV) cell entry receptor 4,5,14 . CoV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated with N-linked glycosylation in the APN protein 15,16 .

They are composed of a short cytoplasmic domain, followed by the transmembrane domain and an extracellular ectodomain with ~930 amino acid residues and several N-linked and O-linked glycosylations 3,18 . The APN ectodomain is composed of four domains, domain I to IV 16, 19 , connected to the membrane by a short linker or stalk 3,18 . The three N-terminal domains I-III are more similar to homologous domains of M1 family members, whereas domain IV is more divergent 3 . Domain II has a thermolysin-like fold and contains the zinc-coordination residues conserved in the active site of gluzincins, two histidines in the HEXXH motif, and a glutamic acid ~24 residues distal from that motif 2, 16, 19 . Several crystal structures of APN in complex with peptides and drugs showed how substrates bind to the active site, providing clues to peptide hydrolysis [19] [20] [21] . The human and pig APN ectodomains share 79% residue identity, domain architecture and dimerization 16, 19 . The C-terminal domain IV is the largest APN domain and, according to the crystal structures, mediates protein dimerization 16, 19 . Porcine CoV recognize a membrane-distal domain IV region, which includes an N-linked glycan in pig APN, as well as a small cavity formed by domain II and IV 16 . The mode by which other CoV recognize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) is distinct from APN 22 , although a glycan N-linked to DPP4 is also involved in the interaction.",

            "text": "The active site accessibility at domain II differed among crystal forms because of interdomain adjustments in the APN. The contacts between domain IV and other domains in the monomers varied among the structures, whereas the domain IV-IV buried surfaces in each monomer at the dimerization interfaces were preserved ( Table 2) . Domain IV contacts with domain I or III changed markedly less (~100-200 \u00c5 2 buried surface) than with domain II (1000 \u00c5 2 ); domain II-IV interaction thus mainly stabilized the closed APN conformation. There were no notable differences in the other interdomain contacts in the distinct APN forms (Table 2) . Domains I-II are distant from domain IV in the open conformation of the APN monomer (Fig. 1a,b) , where the zinc ion at the catalytic site is more accessible to the solvent (Fig. 1c) . The domain I to III module swings 15\u00b0 toward domain IV, closing the active site (Fig. 1b,c) . The hAPN structure adopts an intermediate conformation in the crystals (Fig. 1a) ; the distance between the N terminus of each monomer in the dimer is 116 \u00c5, and the angle difference of Fig. 1a and Table 2 ). On the cell surface, the domain I to III module must swing over domain IV, which is fixed by dimerization (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Video S1). The module movement must be facilitated by the flexible ~30-residue polypeptide that links domain I to the transmembrane domain ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ), although polypeptide length probably limits the interdomain movement shown here with APN (15\u00b0), which is less pronounced than that reported for ERAP-1 (22\u00b0, determined as in Table 2 ). The type of interdomain movement also differs between ERAP-1 and the APN. The domain III-IV module moves together relative to domain I-II in ERAP-1, whereas domain I to III swings over domain IV in the APN. In addition, the ERAP-1 hinge region is at the domain III N terminus, whereas that of APN is in the domain IV N terminus. Domains I, II and III can pivot at the beginning of the first (\u03b1 13) or third (\u03b1 15) domain IV helix, which are perpendicular to the swing angle (Fig. 1b) . These differences in APN motion compared to other aminopeptidases are probably related to dimer formation, which is not observed in other M1 family members. The domain II buried surface increases due to its interaction with domain IV when the conformation changes from open to closed (Table 2) , thus reducing accessibility of the active site cavity (Fig. 1c) . M1 aminopeptidase dynamics is thought necessary for catalysis, and the closed The Met residues of the pAPNeh were replaced by seleno-Met (see Methods). Highest-resolution shell is in parentheses. Favored, allowed and outlier residues (%) in the Ramachandran plot, as well as number of ectodomains in the asymmetric unit (asu) are shown. Statistics for the pAPN-RBD crystal structure discussed here have been reported earlier (PDB code 4F5C) 16 . Structure representations in Supplementary Fig. 1b . (Fig. 2a) . In the closed pAPN, the side chain of a phenylalanine (Phe893) at domain IV was placed at about 4.5 \u00c5 from the hydrolyzable peptide bond, whose carbonyl group is coordinated to the zinc ion. The phenylalanine was located in the loop that connects \u03b1 26 and \u03b1 27 in the single domain IV ARM repeat of human and pig APN (Fig. 2a) ; it penetrated the active site groove in the closed conformation and locked the peptide, ready for hydrolysis. Domain IV residues that precede Phe893 in the \u03b1 26-\u03b1 27 loop contacted domain II in the closed pAPN. A similar loop conformation is seen in a closed hAPN structure (PDB code 4FYS) 19 .",

In flow cytometry, we determined the binding of an RBD-Fc fusion protein to cells that expressed pAPN or an active site mutant (pAPN-HH/AA), alone or with various drugs (Fig. 4a,b) .

We replaced the pAPN domain II Ser464 and domain IV Ser892 and/or Ser929 with cysteine to lock the ectodomain in the closed form with interdomain disulfide bridges. The Ser464 main chain C\u03b1 is ~5 and ~6 \u00c5, respectively, from Ser892 and Ser929 in the closed form, but Ser464 moves ~12 \u00c5 away in the open form ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Disulfide bond formation between pAPN Cys464 and Cys892 or Cys929 should thus prevent ectodomain motion. We expressed the pAPN-cysteine mutants (C2-C4) on the 293T cell surface and compared their catalytic and CoV binding activity with that of the wild type pAPN (Fig. 6) .",

The higher activity of the pAPN C2 than the C3 or C4 mutants suggested that the Cys464-Cys892 disulfide bond was more labile than the Cys464-Cys929 bond, probably because Cys892 is in a flexible loop (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Treatment with a reducing agent restored catalysis and RBD binding in the cysteine mutants and did not affect wild type pAPN binding activity (Fig. 6) . Reducing the disulfide bonds fully restored RBD binding, but catalysis was partially recovered in the pAPN C3 and C4 mutants. Substrate hydrolysis is proposed to close the ectodomain (see above), which would facilitate rebuilding the disulfides. Locking the closed form and the phenylalanine in the domain IV ARM repeat inside the active site probably impeded substrate processing (Fig. 2a) . The pAPN cysteine mutants bound markedly less RBD than the wild type protein, which confirmed that CoV S protein binding to the closed pAPN was sterically hindered (Fig. 2b) , and that CoV recognized the open form. Overall, these results validate the functional relevance of the APN ectodomain conformations and its motion.",

            "text": "APN ectodomain movement is less pronounced and differs from that reported for other M1 aminopeptidases. These differences could be due to the APN dimeric conformation and its linkage to the cell surface. Dimerization only engages the domain IV region, and we found that the dimer is conserved in all APN structures, closed, intermediate and open. APN domain IV thus does not move as described for ERAP-1 or F3 23, 24 , proteins that do not form dimers. The fixed conformation of the APN dimer determines that the domain I to III module swings over domain IV (Supplementary Video S1), with the hinge at the domain IV N-terminal region. The length of this movement is less marked in APN (15\u00b0) than in ERAP-1 (22\u00b0), although the two proteins have very similar closed conformations. Displacement of the APN domains I, II and III must be limited by the length of the flexible polypeptide that links domain I to the transmembrane region, whose movement is restricted by membrane fluidity. The extent of APN movement nonetheless appears to be sufficient for release of the hydrolyzed peptide N-terminal residue, which is not plugged by domain IV in the open or in the intermediate APN conformations (Fig. 2a) . It is not clear how each monomer in the dimer moves, whether their movement is random or synchronized in the same or inverse directions. Experiments with hAPN antibodies 25 and those shown here with the TGEV RBD (Fig. 3) suggest that ~50% of the molecules adopt different forms; these data imply that each APN monomer maintains a distinct conformation (Supplementary Video S1). The crystal structures reported here provide snapshots of APN dynamic conformation, and also guided experiments that demonstrate its role in virus entry into cells and catalysis. The switch between a proteolytic active (closed) and an inactive (open) conformation has been proposed for several M1 aminopeptidases 20, 23, 24, 28 . This dynamics is thought to be important for peptide hydrolysis and release from the aminopeptidase active site. The region that joins \u03b1 26 and \u03b1 27 in the domain IV ARM repeat penetrates the active site groove in closed pig and human APN structures reported here and elsewhere (Fig. 2a) 19 , and a conserved phenylalanine in this region locks the substrate coordinated to the zinc ion, permitting hydrolysis. Further peptide processing likely requires removal of the phenylalanine lock by opening the APN ectodomain, which facilitates N-terminal residue release and peptide translocation, both sterically hindered in the closed conformation (Fig. 2a) . The inherent flexibility in the domain IV ARM repeat that we demonstrate here is linked to interdomain arrangements might also enable substrate processing, and indicate how ectodomain movements participate in peptide hydrolysis. Local changes in a conserved tyrosine (Tyr472 in pAPN) at the active site of M1 aminopeptidases are also suggested to be important 20, 24, 28 . Among APN forms, the absence of conformational switches in active site residues at domain II ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) nonetheless indicates that tyrosine movement is not linked to interdomain motion.",

Cell samples expressing various amounts of pAPN at the membrane were used to normalize the activity of the pAPN cysteine mutants.

A partial structure was obtained by MR using the PHASER program 38 and domains I to III of the tricorn-interacting factor F3 (PDB code 1Z1W), which share ~30% residue identity with pAPN. The PHASER LLG value for the best MR solution was 161, whereas RFZ values were 6.5 and 5.0, and TFZ values of 3.0 and 9.9. We then used the MRSAD protocol in the Auto-Rickshaw server 39 to determine the complete pAPNeh structure, starting from the partial MR structure and using Se-Met pAPNeh crystal diffraction data collected at the selenium peak wavelength. The final structure included the two pAPN molecules of the asymmetric unit, which were adjusted manually and refined with phenix.refine 40 using data extending to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution (for statistics, see Table 1 ).
