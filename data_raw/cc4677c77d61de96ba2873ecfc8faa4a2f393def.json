            "text": "Background: Dicer is a 219-kDa protein that plays key roles in gene regulation, particularly as the ribonuclease III enzyme responsible for cleaving precursor miRNA substrates. Its enzymatic activity is highly regulated by protein factors, and this regulation can impact on the levels of miRNAs and modulate the behavior of a cell. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of regulation, detailed enzymatic and structural characterization of Dicer are needed. However, these types of studies generally require several milligrams of recombinant protein, and efficient preparation of such quantities of pure human Dicer remains a challenge. To prepare large quantities of human Dicer, we have optimized transfection in HEK293-6E cells grown in suspension and streamlined a purification procedure. Results: Transfection conditions were first optimized to achieve expression levels between 10 and 18 mg of recombinant Dicer per liter of culture. A three-step purification protocol was then developed that yields 4-9 mg of purified Dicer per liter of culture in a single day. From SEC-MALS/RI analysis and negative stain TEM, we confirmed that the purified protein is monomerically pure ( \u2265 98%) and folds with the characteristic L-shape geometry. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a dissociation constant (K d ) of 5 nM was measured for Dicer binding to pre-let-7a-1, in agreement with previous reports. However, when probing the cleavage activity of Dicer for pre-let-7a-1, we measured k cat (7.2 \u00b1 0.5 min \u2212 1 ) and K M (1.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM) values that are much higher than previously reported due to experimental conditions that better respect the steady-state assumption.",

            "text": "Dicer is a multi-functional protein that plays a critical role in regulating several fundamental cellular processes, including RNA interference, genome integrity, development, and antiviral immunity (for recent reviews see [1, 2] ). It is a type III endoribonuclease (RNAse) that contributes to RNA interference by processing specific hairpin structures and long double-stranded RNAs into microRNAs (miR-NAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. In the miRNA pathway, Dicer is responsible for cleaving the precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA) into a~22-nucleotide (nt) duplex, from which one strand will be loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to repress mRNA translation. Currently, it is thought that Dicer produces almost all miRNAs in human cells (~2000), which together control over 60% of protein-coding genes [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The pre-miRNA processing activity of Dicer is known to be highly regulated, and this likely contributes to precisely control miRNA levels and thereby determine cell behavior and cell fate. The cleavage activity is regulated by protein cofactors, such as the TAR RNA Binding Protein (TRBP) and the Protein ACTivator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT), as well as by several RNA-binding proteins known to act either as activators or inhibitors (reviewed in [8] ). Moreover, high-throughput studies have identified additional non-coding RNAs that are likely processed by Dicer [9] as well as several pre-miRNA binding proteins that may regulate its cleavage activity [10] [11] [12] . At this time, there is a need to integrate the available data into a coherent and detailed mechanistic understanding of Dicer's activities and regulation via in vitro biochemical, biophysical and structural studies. However, for such research investigations to be carried out effectively, large quantities of highly pure and active recombinant proteins are needed.",

            "text": "Although bacterial overexpression systems generally provide a simple and fast method to obtain significant amount of recombinant proteins, it has not proven practical for human Dicer (219 kDa). Eukaryotic expression systems offer an important alternative for expression of such a large eukaryotic protein because they allow for proper folding and post-translational modifications (reviewed in [13] ). Over the past 15 years, purification of recombinant human Dicer following expression in insect cells (Sf9) infected by baculovirus has been achieved with yields up to 0.5-1 mg/L culture [14] [15] [16] . This has allowed for the in vitro characterization of human Dicer's enzymatic activity [14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and provided the first descriptions of its three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at 20-30 \u00c5-resolution [26] [27] [28] . Subsequently, the production method in insect cells was improved by systematic optimization of the overexpression and purification steps to yield milligram amounts (3-4 mg/L culture) of highly pure Drosophila melanogaster Dicer-2 (dmDicer-2) [29] , which was used for its structure determination by cryo-EM at 7-\u00c5 resolution. More recently, expression in HEK293 cells grown in suspension was reported as part of a cryo-EM study of human Dicer that allowed structural reconstruction at 4.4-\u00c5 resolution [30] . This study provided unprecedented details into Dicer's domain organization as well as its interaction with TRBP and a pre-miRNA substrate. However, the optimization of Dicer production and the yields obtained were not reported. Therefore, it is possible that large-scale expression from mammalian cells grown in suspension could be optimized to provide pure protein at higher yields than currently reported. Such a procedure could be useful for future biochemical and structural investigations as there is still no X-ray or cryo-EM structure of human Dicer at atomic resolution and there are many questions that remain about its mechanism and regulation by protein factors.",

To overcome the challenge of Dicer over-expression, we optimized transfection and expression in an HEK293-EBNA1 cell line. This allowed for purification of up to 9 mg of Dicer per liter of culture. A purification protocol was designed to minimize sample handling as well as to provide maximal recovery, purity and enzymatic activity. Although we noticed that human Dicer forms multimers at high concentration, our final three-step purification yields highly-pure monomeric Dicer. The structure and activity of the purified Dicer were assessed by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light-scattering and refractive index (SEC-MALS/RI), negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM), binding assay and steady-state kinetics. Our kinetic analysis for Dicer cleavage of the pre-let-7a-1 substrate were performed under strict steady state conditions and reveals k cat and K M values that are much higher than previously reported. Overall, this new method will facilitate future biochemical, biophysical and structural characterization of Dicer, including its interaction with RNA substrates and protein regulators.",

This mammalian expression system has been engineered for maximal expression of recombinant His-tagged proteins in serum-free media [34] . Linear polyethyleninime (PEI) was selected as an efficient and cost-effective transfection reagent. For optimization of transfection conditions, small-scale suspension cultures were grown in serum-free media, either as 2-mL cultures in 6-well plates or 20-mL cultures in 20-mL disposable Erlenmeyer flasks. In initial experiments where different quantities of plasmid DNA (1, 1.5 and 2 mg per L of culture) and PEI:DNA ratios (2:1 or 3:1) were tested, we found that optimal transfection efficiency could be reached when transfecting cells diluted to 0.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL 24 h in advance using 1 mg of Dicer-expressing pTT5 plasmid with 2 mg linear PEI per L of culture. To estimate the transfection efficiency, we replaced 5% of the total transfected plasmid by a GFP-expressing plasmid and used fluorescence microscopy to count the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. Transfection efficiencies of 30-40% were typically reached at 48 h post transfection (hpt) (Fig. 1a) . Such transfection efficiencies are considered very good especially when taking into account that they are underestimated compared to a transfection using 100% GFP-expressing plasmid [35] . The cell cultures were monitored up to 96 hpt to assess cell viability and viable cell density as well as the intracellular expression of recombinant Dicer. It was found that cell viability decreases below 75% beyond 72 hpt (Fig. 1b,  green) , whereas viable cell density is maintained at 3.2 \u00d7 10 6 cell/mL (Fig. 1b, black) and Dicer expression levels are not significantly changed (Fig. 1c) . Similar results were obtained with large-scale transfections of up to 1 L. Thus, the optimum time for collecting the cells for protein purification was determined to be 72 hpt, taking into consideration that additional time may lead to protein modifications that would adversely affect its activity. At 72 hpt, volumetric expression of the intracellular Dicer protein was 14 \u00b1 4 mg per L of culture on average (Fig. 1c) .",

For cell lysis, the washed cell pellet was resuspended in a low salt buffer containing 0.1% NP-40, allowing for lysis of the plasma membrane while leaving the nuclei intact. Nuclei and cell debris were then removed by centrifugation and filtering of the resulting supernatant. The first step of purification consisted of an anion-exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose Fast Flow), which helped remove protein and nucleic acid contaminants (Fig. 2c ). The addition of 10% glycerol in the elution buffers was found critical to purify Dicer free of contamination with Hsp70 (~70-kDa intense band in lane 1 of Fig. 2f ), which is one of the most abundant protein in the HEK-293 cell line [36] . The Dicer-containing fractions were pooled and directly loaded on a HisTrap HP column for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC; Fig.  2d ). This step, which was carried out in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl and in the absence of glycerol, allowed for (Fig. 2f ) . The Dicer fractions were then loaded on a size-exclusion column (SEC) to isolate the major monomeric population from multimeric contaminants. When this monomeric population of Dicer was concentrated by ultrafiltration under standard conditions (e.g. 50 mM Tris pH 8.2, 10 mM NaCl/KCl 24:1, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and 0.5 mM TCEP), it resulted in a significant loss of protein via precipitation. In addition, when Dicer was concentrated prior to SEC purification, substantial amounts of Dicer multimers were detected in the SEC elution profile. This led us to identify conditions that would allow for maximum protein recovery following concentration by ultrafiltration. We found that addition of sucrose and the non-ionic detergent n-dodecyl-\u03b2-Dmaltoside (DDM) helped stabilize the monomeric form. Thus, these reagents were added to the mobile phase during SEC (Fig. 2e , f ), and fractions containing monomeric Dicer could be readily concentrated at up to 22.5 \u03bcM (5 mg/mL) without precipitation. Analysis of the purified protein by SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue shows greater than 90% purity (Fig. 2f) , whereas Western blot analysis indicate that~50% of the protein is recovered from the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.  2g ). Yields of 4-9 mg of human Dicer per liter of culture were typically obtained from large-scale preparations.",

Although a small percentage of multimeric protein appears to be present in the void volume of the SEC (elution volume~8 mL), the purified Dicer elutes predominantly as a single peak that corresponds to \u226598% of the total protein in the injected sample. The derived molecular weight for this peak based on light-scattering data is 224 \u00b1 2 kDa, which essentially matches the theoretical molecular weight of the Histagged monomeric protein (221 kDa). The polydispersity index of 1.02 \u00b1 0.01 over the entire eluted peak indicates that the main form of purified Dicer is monodisperse, i.e. homogeneous with respect to molar mass. Moreover, SEC -MALS/RI analysis of a purified Dicer sample stored for 6 months at \u2212 80\u00b0C in sucrose/DDM-containing buffer shows that the purified protein remains almost exclusively monomeric ( \u2265 94%), indicating that the protein is intact after long-term storage (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ).",

To our knowledge this yield is higher than previously reported for human Dicer, and it may be possible to obtain even higher yields by further optimizing transfection conditions, expressing Dicer as a secreted protein, and/or developing an efficient stable transfection clone [31, 35, 39, 40] . The reported purification protocol was designed to prevent protein aggregation and precipitation, since we observed that Dicer tends to form multimers and precipitate at high-concentration or when it contacts metallic surfaces.

Following cell lysis in low-salt buffer, the cytoplasmic fraction was first loaded on an anion-exchange column. The large volume and high salt concentration of the elution fractions from this first purification step is compatible with direct loading onto the HisTrap affinity column. Subsequently, the small elution volume from the second purification step allowed for a single injection on the preparative size-exclusion column without any additional manipulations. Overall, this strategy allows for multi-step purification of milligram amounts of recombinant Dicer in a fast and efficient manner.

Given the k cat /K M of~10 5 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 and the very low k cat value of~0.1 s \u2212 1 , the rate-limiting step may be product release as observed with other RNAse III enzymes [38, 45] or possibly the slow formation and/ or conversion of the enzyme-substrate complex into a catalytically productive conformation. Dicer is a complex and dynamic enzyme that is known to interact with several cellular proteins [46] , and there is increasing evidence that conformational changes may be important for its cleavage activity. Free Dicer is known to adopt different conformations, as confirmed here from negative stain TEM studies, and binding of pre-miRNA or double-stranded RNA substrates is linked to structural rearrangements [18, 23, 27, 37] . Furthermore, singlemolecule fluorescence studies have provided evidence for Dicer adopting two different binding modes with a pre-let-7a-1 substrate [47] . More recently, cryo-EM reconstructions of a pre-miRNA/Dicer/TRBP complex captured two distinct conformations of a pre-dicing state, from which transition to the dicing state would require repositioning of the pre-miRNA in the enzyme processing center [30] . Thus, additional studies are needed to better define the detailed kinetic mechanism of Dicer and characterize the role that conformational changes play along the cleavage reaction pathway.",

To achieve these objectives, we minimized sample manipulation which, in turn, reduced the duration of the purification to a single work day. The purified enzyme adopts the typical L-shape architecture and binds a pre-let-7a-1 substrate in the low nM range, as previously observed. Steady-state kinetic studies yielded higher k cat and K M values than previously reported due to the use of experimental conditions that respected the steady-state assumption.
