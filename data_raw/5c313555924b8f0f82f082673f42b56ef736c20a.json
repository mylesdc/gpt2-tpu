One year after the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated its Zika response, more than 30 variants of preventive behaviors were being promoted. This situation challenged social and behavior change (SBC) programming efforts that require a coordinated response and agreed upon set of focus behaviors to be effective. To support USAID implementing partners in harmonizing prevention efforts to reduce Zika infection, we developed an evidence-based process to identify behaviors with the highest potential to reduce Zika infection and transmission. We compiled a full list of behaviors and selected the most promising for a full evidence review. The review included systematic keyword searches on Google Scholar, extraction of all relevant published articles on Aedes-borne diseases between 2012 and 2018, review of seminal papers, and review of gray literature. We examined articles to determine each behavior's potential effectiveness in preventing Zika transmission or reducing the Aedes aegypti population. We also developed assessment criteria to delineate the ease with which the target population could adopt each behavior, including: (1) required frequency; (2) feasibility of the behavior; and (3) accessibility and cost of the necessary materials in the setting. These behaviors were refined through a consensus-building process with USAID's Zika implementing partners, considering contextual factors. The resulting 7 evidence-based preventive behaviors have high potential to strengthen SBC programming's impact in USAID's Zika response: (1) apply mosquito repellent, (2) use condoms during pregnancy, (3) remove standing water, (4) cover water storage containers, (5) clean/remove mosquito eggs from water containers, (6) seek antenatal care, and (7) seek family planning counseling. This case study documents a flexible process that can be adapted to inform the prioritization of behaviors when there is limited evidence available, as during many emergency responses.",

The first outbreak of Zika detected in the Americas occurred in 2015, with a spike in suspected congenital malformations and other neurological complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 1 By August 3, 2017, there were approximately 217,000 confirmed Zika cases, and about 3,400 cases of associated congenital Zika syndrome. 2 Zika is now considered endemic throughout Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), parts of Africa, and Asia. Between 29% and 82% of Zika infections are asymptomatic according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3 Infection during pregnancy is linked to congenital Zika syndrome in newborns, which is characterized by severe microcephaly (small head size), decreased brain tissue mass, and subcortical calcification. 4 Other health abnormalities, including developmental delays, associated with the Zika virus have been reported. Research on the impact of the virus on mothers and children is ongoing. 4 The outbreak in LAC demanded a concerted regional response, given the wide distribution of the mosquito vector, the lack of population-level immunity, the absence of a vaccine or rapid diagnostic test, uneven access to water due to low quality water and sanitation infrastructure, water shortages, lack of information about the disease, and inadequate health systems to respond to the health impacts. 1 On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 5 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other U.S. government entities and international partners began working together through existing country systems to reduce the risk of new Zika infections, particularly in pregnant women, and to provide care for those affected through interventions in vector control, social and behavior change (SBC), and health service delivery. 6 The focus for this process was SBC for individuals, households, and communities in Zika-affected regions, only.",

            "text": "USAID's SBC programming was comprised mainly of mass and social media, community engagement, and interpersonal communication, with the goal to \"raise awareness, reduce misinformation, and address the barriers that prevent individuals, families, and communities from practicing lifesaving behaviors to improve health outcomes.\" 7 The SBC literature suggests that behavior change is more likely to occur when clear and concise messaging is repeated frequently through multiple channels. [8] [9] When too many preventive behaviors are promoted or messages lack precision, adopting prevention behaviors can be inhibited or done in a way that is either ineffective or counterproductive. 8 Messaging can be particularly challenging during emergency responses when data may be unavailable to inform programming and time constraints inhibit collective planning, leading to the promotion of messages before a concerted and harmonized response can be organized. In a non-systematic, rapid desk review of SBC messages approximately 1 year after the USAID Zika response began, we identified more than 30 variants of prevention behaviors that were being promoted. The prevention messages for these behaviors were not consistently presented, lacked cohesion in their packaging, and offered little specificity regarding how the behavior should be implemented to effectively reduce Zika infection and transmission. Too many behaviors with insufficiently specific instructions in the messages could have resulted in confusion, information overload, and incorrect performance of the behaviors among individuals and communities. The behaviors promoted were also not always based on available evidence around their effectiveness in relation to Zika transmission. Facing an outbreak of a disease new to the Americas, public health institutions and organizations found themselves conducting research while simultaneously launching interventions and programs. At the time programs were rolling out, there were limited data to guide SBC programming and messaging for the most effective preventive actions for individuals and communities. These circumstances often led to a lack of cohesion in promoted behaviors and SBC messages. To more effectively coordinate the Zika response among implementing partners and increase the rate of behavior adoption among target populations, the Breakthrough ACTION \u00fe Research Projects, in collaboration with USAID, developed an evidence-based process to identify priority behaviors with the highest potential for preventing Zika acquisition and transmission. Stakeholders across disciplines and involved in various levels of programming were engaged throughout to ensure buy-in, harmonize priority behaviors and their SBC messages, and ensure a more effective Zika response. Existing research could be leveraged because the transmission dynamics for Zika were similar to other arboviruses and sexually transmitted infections; preventive behaviors targeting the vector (the Aedes aegypti mosquito) and practices to reduce sexual transmission had already been identified in the literature and could be assessed for Zika. Understanding the transmission dynamics was critical to identifying behaviors to consider for prevention. The exercise, referred to as the \"behavior prioritization process,\" focused on a range of individual-and household-level behaviors to reduce the risk of Zika acquisition and transmission. Messages were developed by partners based on the set of behaviors identified and prioritized in this process.",

A team of experts in SBC programming and vector control was enlisted to categorize and refine the behaviors. All of the Zika prevention messages were first grouped together by behavior to create a condensed version of about 15 behaviors. Through an iterative review process including experts and discussions with partners, the list was distilled to 7 key behaviors ( Table 1) .

To narrow down to these 7 behaviors, we used a combination of expert opinion, initial scan of available evidence, and factors such as whether USAID was supporting the behavior by procuring the materials necessary. Two of the final 7 behaviors were considered enabling behaviors and recommended but not included in the evidence review, given the substantial existing evidence on these behaviors. Five behaviors were explored in a full literature review to ascertain their relative effectiveness. During the literature review phase, partners provided additional gray literature where applicable. The full findings were presented at a subsequent SBC Technical Working Group meeting to ensure a consensus on the findings. The initial purpose of presenting the findings was to further narrow down the prioritized behaviors, but after partners expressed significant pushback, the full list of 7 behaviors were agreed upon. Any feedback from implementing partners regarding how behaviors were carried out, contextual challenges, or unpublished effectiveness findings was integrated into the final recommendations, and the results were disseminated to all USAID implementing partners.",

The use of these repellents was also considered safe for use during pregnancy. [11] [12] [13] We did not find program or intervention studies that assessed the impact of mosquito repellent on arbovirus disease transmission, but deduced a strong likelihood of effectiveness because it prevents mosquito bites. Concerning the third criterion-\"easy to do and amenable to change\"-repellent must be applied frequently (multiple times per day) to be effective, particularly if the person is sweating, swimming, or changing clothes. 10, 14 The use of repellent was considered to have medium feasibility because individuals decide whether to use repellent and therefore have control; however, those who have low literacy or limited access to trained antenatal care or pharmacies may have a disadvantage in following the written package instructions. Mosquito repellents are sold on the market in most countries in LAC and generally available in these settings. Contextual information regarding repellents was reported from partners working in the field with local knowledge. USAID also has procured repellents for distribution at antenatal care clinics in a few select countries. The price may be a barrier, particularly for low-income households.",

Although statistical modeling suggests that sexual transmission of Zika is only 4%-5% of total transmission in the general population, 19-20 the attributable risk of exposure among sexually active women may be twice as high.21 This increased risk of exposure, combined with the severity of outcomes in pregnancy, led to the identification of pregnant women and their partners as a target population for messaging about condom use. We found that condom-use behavior had a mixed amenability to change for 3 reasons: first, condoms must be worn consistently and correctly to be effective (on the basis of findings from the sexually transmitted infection literature), including throughout pregnancy 17, 22 ; second, the behavior is complex, requiring negotiation between partners [23] [24] [25] [26] ; and third, since condom use is not considered a normative behavior during pregnancy, it may be challenging to promote and adopt. 24 Condoms are widely available in pharmacies and health centers in LAC, but access may be limited for women of low income. 27",

One study found a greater than 70% reduction in the adult mosquito population following a very strict intervention, involving community campaigns and visits from trained volunteers, to remove stagnant water. 28 However, individuals and households may find it challenging to perform this behavior correctly and consistently. To have an impact on the Aedes mosquito population, and thus Zika transmission, it requires an ongoing, collective effort, [28] [29] including households as well as common areas, such as schools, clinics, cemeteries, and others. To maximize the potential impact, efforts need to focus on the highest-density mosquito-breeding sites as identified by entomological data collection. [30] [31] [32] General clean-up campaigns in which communities receive information to clean their yards or communal areas without specificity on targets for removal often are only effective if they target the most productive breeding sites. 33 In addition, these kinds of interventions are challenging to measure since clean-up campaigns are often conducted in conjunction with other interventions, and studies do not isolate the effect of any one of them. 33 Despite these concerns, when instructions are clear and focused, regular removal of standing water is relatively easy to do and amenable to change; special materials are unnecessary in most cases. However, the feasibility is somewhat complex; the targeting of breeding sites should depend on how productive they are (to identify the highest-density breeding sites), and those sites are often either difficult to access (e.g., in storm drains) or located in communal areas requiring collective effort and engagement to attempt (e.g., in schools or construction sites). In addition, this behavior requires weekly action, based on the life cycle of Aedes mosquitoes. 34 Covering water storage containers at all times with a tight-fitting cover that does not warp or touch the water: Covering longterm water storage containers has moderate potential efficacy in reducing breeding sites if a tight-fitting, long-lasting lid is available. Covering short-term water storage containers has less potential efficacy, as frequent lid use can result in wear and tear and render the lids ineffective or counterproductive.",

A small number of studies suggest that the correct use of lids is associated with a significant reduction in pupal infestation if the containers are used infrequently. 35 However, correct use and adequate lids are critical; if the lid is broken or touches the water in the container, the lid itself can spawn a breeding site for Aedes mosquitoes. 34 The beneficial effect of correctly using a lid is mixed or even reversed if the water-storage container is used very often, constantly opened and closed, or often left open. 34 This behavior, when done correctly, may reduce transmission at the population level, but in most published evidence, it is combined with community mobilization and cleaning of containers, making it challenging to isolate its effect. 35 The behavior itself is relatively easy to implement. For long-term storage containers (from which water is accessed infrequently), the frequency of removing lids is low 34 and relatively feasible, assuming the lids are used correctly. 34 However, as research is ongoing to determine what type of lids are the most effective, access to proper lids was rated low. For short-term water storage, the frequent opening and closing of lids and additional requirement of monitoring the quality of the cover reduces ease of implementation, and therefore, its effectiveness. Long-term water storage containers coupled with correct use of tight-fitting, long-lasting lids, may enable this behavior to have moderate potential efficacy in reducing Aedes breeding sites.",

Partners requested focusing on behaviors that families and communities could do themselves (\"locus of control\" at the household). Points of contention often centered around behaviors that were being promoted already and were perceived by partners to be effective but had mixed evidence. For example, covering water storage containers was found to effective in the literature only for long-term water storage containers, but ultimately short-term containers were included in the guidance based on conversations with partners. This was mainly because partners perceived this behavior (covering water storage containers with a lid) to be effective based on this behavior being implemented already and being received positively. However, for other behaviors, for example use of bed nets, we clarified that although these are effective for malaria, they are not effective for Zika, and this was ultimately agreed upon and the guidance accepted. Through the process, partners were reminded that choices had to be made to prioritize key behaviors; although all of them were potentially effective, we were looking for relative effectiveness to prioritize the most effective ones and focus on them.

This situation often leads to a lack of cohesion in the promoted behaviors and SBC messages. The behavior prioritization process documented in this article was developed to help USAID implementing partners identify focal behaviors for prevention to harmonize SBC programming efforts for greater impact. The process combined available evidence and a consensusbuilding approach to allow for adaptation based on local context. The consensus-building approach was critical for selecting behaviors and necessitated coordination across all stakeholders involved in the response across disciplines (e.g., public health, entomology, medical, and other technical area experts) and across response partners (e.g., those involved in mass media, service delivery, and community engagement). Types of behaviors were selected based on the transmission dynamics of the disease; Zika is transmitted by vector (mosquito) and sexually, highlighting preventive behaviors to consider. Behavior change is complex, and each behavior is comprised of many different behaviors and decisions that have to be addressed to successfully change.

During the West Africa Ebola outbreak, researchers were attempting to understand the behaviors to target to interrupt transmission, while programmers were developing prevention and treatment programs and messages in real-time; research and evidence generation came later. In the case of Zika, the disease was previously known in east Asia and the Pacific but was entirely new to LAC. However, other Aedes aegypti mosquito viruses were prevalent in the region, specifically, dengue, which had been circulating in the region for more than 50 years, and chikungunya had emerged in 2013. Thus, information regarding best practices to prevent transmission could be gleaned from previous mosquito control and behavior change programming from LAC and southeast Asia and could be adapted to Zika prevention efforts.",

First, unlike dengue or chikungunya, Zika is mostly asymptomatic or presents mild symptoms; LAC is the first setting where it has been widely associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome). Second, it was found that Zika can be transmitted sexually, but other arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya, cannot. Although we were able to adapt an extensive evidence base for vector control of the Aedes aegypti population, there were little to no published data available regarding sexual transmission of Zika or its impact on pregnancy outcomes. Sexual transmission and the link with congenital malformations meant we needed to consider specific behaviors and messaging directed to pregnant women and women of reproductive age. To address this gap, evidence was gleaned and adapted",

The third criteria of the process comprised a set of 3 components related to behavior amenability to change in the LAC setting. This step was an important contextual step because the effectiveness of a behavior is largely dependent on whether people are able and willing to perform it and was additionally complicated because Zika was new to the region. Because the behavior prioritization process was started after a year of Zika response, local partners had field experience to advise on which priority behaviors were feasible to implement and which materials were available and affordable. A consensus-building approach with USAID and its implementing partners was developed to categorize the relevant behaviors by criteria. Although the evidence review highlighted behaviors with potential to prevent diseases with the same modes of transmission or reduction of the same vector population as Zika, it was critical for each focal behavior to be assessed through the lens of this third criteria to ensure partner buy-in-that recommendations were realistic and reflected the context on the ground. The result of the process was a set of priority behaviors based on a combination of research evidence and context from partners with local knowledge.",

            "text": "The behavior prioritization process was developed to streamline the Zika response but began mid-implementation, by which time many partners were already deploying various behavior change recommendations. Any suggested changes to SBC programming that stemmed from the findings of this necessitated midcourse corrections. All 5 behaviors were prioritized by the USAID Zika response across 20 countries, and included interventions such as regional mass media campaigns, household and school-based SBC activities, household visits by vector control technicians, community fairs, and health care provider counseling. Several key products were developed and made available to implementing partners to facilitate the incorporation of the findings of the process, including a list of priority behaviors and detailed guidance on how to correctly perform each behavior for maximum effectiveness (through a Behavior Matrix [Supplement 1], Technical Specifications Content Guide [Supplement 2], and a job aid). These products were useful for SBC programs to reconfigure and refine their messages as they continued to implement their SBC interventions. Many partners reported that the guidance provided a basis to focus their limited remaining resources and to attain the needed specificity for each behavior to be effectively implemented. The iterative, collaborative process of defining behaviors across all stakeholders was critical to ensuring a more harmonized and feasible response. This process strives to incorporate evidence where it is available and was refined as the work developed, allowing it to be responsive to new evidence and contextualized based on input and expertise from those on the ground. This process can identify and select behaviors with the most potential to reduce transmission, is designed to be adapted to local contexts, and is flexible and based on consensus building with local and international stakeholders. Our experience developing this process provides a potential model for future public health emergencies, as it highlights a way forward in prioritizing behaviors in evidence in situations where direct evidence is limited or absent, time is constrained, and there are many key stakeholders.",
