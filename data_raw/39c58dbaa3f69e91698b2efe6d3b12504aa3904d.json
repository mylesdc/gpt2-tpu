            "text": "Heterosexual transmission is the most common route of HIV-1 infection in women. 1, 2 A key co-factor in the transmission of HIV-1 in women is the prior existence of bacterial, viral, and parasitic microbes in the cervix that can alter the cervical environment and thereby influence HIV-1 transmission. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Gonorrhoeae caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), a gram-negative diplococci, is one of the most severe and common forms of STI 9,10 that has been shown to increase HIV-1 acquisition. [10] [11] [12] The presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the vaginal fluid of NGinfected women and some cell line-based studies with NG led to the speculation that NG-induced inflammatory cytokines either directly or indirectly could increase HIV-1 transmission. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Additional mechanisms of NG-induced enhanced HIV-1 transmission that have been suggested include recruitment of increased number of endocervical CD4+ T cells in NG-infected women providing more targets for HIV-1, 17 activation of CD4+ T cells by NG, 18 epithelial tight junction disruption, 19 and increased HIV-1 transcription by NG-secreted proteins. 20 The molecular mechanism by which NG enhances HIV-1/transmission in the female genital tract is still uncertain. Part of the uncertainty is due to lack of a suitable ex vivo model that mimics in vivo situation. HIV-1/NG interaction has been mostly studied in in vitro cell culture using CD4+ T cells, endometrial epithelial cells, 15, 18, 21, 22 and immortalized cell lines. 15, 23 However, these cell systems do not accurately reflect situation that occur in human cervix/vaginal tissue. In addition, we do not know the mechanism of HIV-1 transmission through the epithelia of the cervical mucosa, especially when epithelia do not express CD4 and CCR5/ CXCR4. [24] [25] [26] Regardless of how HIV-1 crosses the epithelium, HIV-1 exposure to the epithelial layer or epithelial cells has been shown to induce production of cytokines and chemokines which serve as signaling molecules. 27, 28 These signaling molecules may play an important role in HIV-1 transmission by attracting target immune cells to fuel HIV-1 infection in sub-mucosa and hence transmission. 29, 30 Here we describe use of a primary cervical tissue-based organ culture model of NG infection that provides the natural cervical tissue architecture observed in cervix of NG-infected women.",

The cellular circulation system here is limited; therefore, it does not help study the mechanism of migration of cells to different areas of the body. In spite of this, the system is well equipped to study the basic immediate impact of HIV-1 infection and its transmission across the mucosa along with the migration of cells from the basal to the apical end of the tissue explants. 33 Another limitation of this study is the small sample size. This is primarily because of the low availability of cervical tissues to work with, and thus, we could not use more than 3 tissues for any experiment. There is also a difference in age, race, and the menstrual cycle among different tissues obtained which may affect the susceptibility to infection. This may be the reason why some tissues transmitted more easily and produced more cytokine response than the others when exposed to HIV-1 or NG. Like in our case, one tissue exposed to HIV-1 during the cytokine upregulation study showed very high cytokine response compared to others. This was a more susceptible tissue. The higher sample size (n = 14) in this study ( Table 2 ) helped in determining the significance of the study. ",

            "text": "enhanced HIV-1 transmission is largely unknown because of the unavailability of a suitable in vitro model. We described here a cervical tissue-based organ culture model that mimics several aspects of cervical tissues in vivo. This includes the minimal toxicity of NG to cervical tissue, NG-induced membrane ruffling, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines with the highest being that of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. However, such cytokine responses were not dependent on live NG, therefore could be elicited by the bacterial outer membrane structure.The data reported here affirm previous epidemiological presumptions in NG-infected women that it was not NG per se but NGIS, analogous to cervical/vaginal milieu, that induced expression of the HIV-1 LTR and replication competent HIV-1 from latently infected lymphocytic and pro-monocytic cells. This is in accord with recentdata showing heptose monophosphate (HMP) secreted from NG-infected cells activates the HIV-1 LTR in CD4 + T cells. 20 Most importantly, NGIS enhanced HIV-1 transmission across cervical mucosa, most likely by increasing HIV-1 transcription in the sub-mucosa. All of these data together indicate that this cervical tissue-based organ culture system could be an appropriate model to study NG-induced enhanced HIV-1 transmission in cervical tissues. Another problem in investigating molecular determinants of NG-driven increased HIV-1 acquisition in the female genital tract is due to our lack of a clear understanding of cellular factors that are responsible for HIV-1 transmission through epithelia of the cervical mucosa, especially when cervical epithelia do not express significant amount of CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4. 24,25 The other parts of the female reproductive tract especially the uterine epithelium have however been shown to express HIV-1 receptors/co-receptors. 60 We have reasoned that pro-inflammatory cytokines often present in genital secretions of patients with NG 12-15 interact with cellular factors responsible for HIV-1 transmission and thereby enhance HIV-1 transmission. Here we provided evidence using transcriptome analysis of cervical epithelium exposed to NG or HIV-1, that NG infection induced in cervical epithelia two cellular proteins CXCL10 and IL-8 that were also induced during HIV-1 transmission across cervical mucosa. Furthermore, the role of CXCL10 and IL-8 on HIV-1 transmission has been confirmed by the finding of enhanced HIV-1 transmission with direct addition of CXCL10 and IL8, and inhibition of HIV-1 transmission by inhibitors of CXCL10 and IL-8. To decipher how NG infection might be involved in upregulation of CXCL10 and IL-8, we noticed that IL-1\u03b2 secreted by NG has been shown to induce CXCL10 and IL-8 in intestinal epithelial cells. Our data in cervical tissue also showed that IL-1\u03b2 induced CXCL10 and IL-8 expression with a concomitant increase in HIV-1 transmission across cervical mucosa. In addition, NG infection causes migration of CD3+ T cells toward the intraepithelial region which is in line with known chemo-attractant properties of CXCL10 and IL-8 for CD3+ T cells and macrophages that have been predicted from the IPA analysis of differentially expressed genes in HIV-1-and NG-exposed epithelia. Furthermore, it has been shown that CD4+ cells are the first cells that become infected within 24 hours of infection during HIV-1 transmission across cervical mucosa. 33,61 Altogether these data are consistent with a model (Figure 6) for NG-induced enhancement of HIV-1 transmission: NG infection leads to secretion of IL-1\u03b2, which induces production of epithelial CXCL10 and IL-8. Upon HIV-1 infection, increase of these cytokines causes migration of the CD3+ T cells toward the intraepithelial region which fuels higher HIV-1 replication in the sub-mucosa and consequently enhances HIV-1 transmission. Identification of IL-1\u03b2 and its target cellular proteins in NG-induced enhanced HIV-1 transmission could be useful in development of drugs that impede the HIV-1 transmission. The explant",
