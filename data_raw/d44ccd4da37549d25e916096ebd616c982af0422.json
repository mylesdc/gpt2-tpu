The major potential of IAV to cause seasonal epidemics or pandemics is linked to their genomic variability. A high number of mutations results from the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral RNA replication (antigenic drift). Furthermore, reassortment of genome segments may occur upon co-infection of the same cell by two or more different virus strains, often resulting in viruses with reassorted genomes and profoundly changed antigenic and biological propertie [1] [2] [3] . These genetic changes may cause immune escape from pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, resistance to antiviral drugs as well as changes in host tropism and/or replication efficiency in specific hosts. In addition, \"candidate pandemic influenza viruses\" (CPIV) may emerge from avian reservoirs and evolve into viruses that are efficiently transmitted among humans. Such pandemic strains often carry mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA), the virus glycoprotein that mediates binding to the cellular receptor. In some cases, amino acid (aa) substitutions in the HA cause a change in receptor usage from an avian-type receptor (\u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid, \u03b1 2,3-SA) to a human-type receptor (\u03b1 2,6 linked sialic acid, \u03b1 2,6-SA), resulting in variants that are efficiently transmitted in humans 4, 5 . Furthermore, aa substitutions in the HA cleavage site and/or other viral proteins may enhance the pathogenicity of newly evolved virus strains in specific hosts [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The previous century has seen several major pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu (caused by an IAV H1N1 strain resulting in more than 50 million deaths), the 1957 Asian flu (H2N2, 1.5 million deaths), the 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2, 1 million deaths) and the 2009 Mexican flu (H1N1, 18,000 deaths) 10, 12, 13 . Other IAVs, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype, are transmitted less efficiently in humans but feature extremely high case-fatality ratios of close to 60%. These viruses were first detected in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong, where six fatalities occurred due to infection with avian H5N1-type IAV 14, 15 . After several years with sporadic outbreaks, a second and main wave of infections with H5N1 viruses started in 2003 in some Asian countries, which then spread to Europe, the Middle East and Africa 16, 17 . In 2006, first human infections occurred in Egypt, with sporadic infections being reported in the following years 18 20 .",

These values correspond to the electronion interaction potential (EIIP), which determines electronic properties of amino acids and nucleotides. The signal obtained is then decomposed into a periodical function by Fourier transformation, resulting in a series of frequencies (F) and their amplitudes (A). The obtained frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs with defined physico-chemical characteristics that are responsible for the biological function of the sequence. When comparing proteins that share the same biological or biochemical function(s) this technique allows the detection of code/frequency pairs that are specific for their common biological properties. The method is insensitive to the location of the motifs and, thus, does not require previous alignment of the sequences. The ISM was successfully applied to predict the biological function of novel proteins, in structure/function analyses of different protein and DNA sequences and in de novo design of biologically active peptides (http://www.vin.bg.ac.rs/180/anims/ISMEIIP_Approach.html).",

ISM analysis of H5N1 HA1 sequences of HPAIV circulating between 2006 and 2014 in Egypt suggested that the mutations K153D, S223N and G272S may significantly increase the affinity of these viruses towards the human receptor. This is based on the observed increase in amplitude at the frequency (F) 0.236, representing the interaction with human cells, which is accompanied by a reduction in amplitude at F0.076, representing the interaction with avian cells. To validate our conclusions derived from these in silico studies, we generated replication-incompetent HA-pseudotyped retroviral particles (PRP) expressing H5-HA proteins with the respective codon substitutions (single or combined) and studied the entry of these PRPs into cells overexpressing human HA receptors in vitro. To further corroborate this set of data, recombinant IAV carrying equivalent substitutions in their HA genes were generated and their replication was analyzed in cell culture. As a safety measure, the multibasic HA-cleavage site present in the pathogenic H5-HA was replaced by a monobasic cleavage site in both the wildtype construct (Wt-LP IAV) and the mutants, resulting in viruses that required trypsin for fusion activity. Viruses carrying the specific HA substitutions were found to replicate more efficiently in mammalian cells overexpressing receptors for human HA, when compared to the parental Wt-LP IAV.",

Also, the predictions and hypotheses derived from our in silico analysis combined with our subsequent experimental studies to validate these predictions are in line with the recent natural evolution of IAV in Egypt. Thus, a fairly consistent picture arises with respect to mutations that may play a role in the adaption of avian IAV to the human receptor. The available evidence leads us to suggest that Egyptian H5N1 HPAIV are evolving towards increased human tropism, a prerequisite for increased pandemic potential of these viruses. Our study illustrates the power of bioinformatic approaches in making early predictions on possible adaptation of specific strains to new hosts and the emergence of CPIV. ",

Thus, the amplitude values of F(0.076) and F(0.236) can be used as indicators of the respective viral tropism (bird versus human). A ratio of A(0.236)/A(0.076) < 1 suggests that the virus preferentially infects birds. Conversely, A(0.236)/A(0.076) > 1 suggests that the virus is more likely to infect humans. Therefore, mutations in the H5N1 HA1 that decrease the amplitude F(0.076) and/or increase the amplitude F(0.236) are predicted to improve the recognition of the human receptor, leading to a virus that, most likely, infects humans more efficiently. In other words, increased A(0.236)/A(0.076) ratios indicate that viruses expressing the respective HA1 protein are more likely to infect humans.",

Importantly, the prevalence of a specific G272S replacement (that also occurred in combination with S223N) increased over time. Interestingly, these aa substitutions are highly specific for Egyptian H5N1 viruses and not conserved or very rare in the HA proteins of viruses isolated in other parts of Africa or in Europe and America. To obtain further evidence for a potentially increased pandemic risk associated with H5N1 HPAIV carrying these mutations, we characterized the respective mutations in the structural context of an HA of an IAV strain from another geographical region. To this end, we introduced 10 mutations Table S2) . Among all the mutations tested, K153D, S223(N,I) and G272S were found to increase the amplitude at the frequency F(0.236) most profoundly, the latter representing the frequency determined for human-adapted IAV strains (Fig. 1) . The amplitude increase at F(0.236) was linked to an amplitude reduction at F(0.076), indicating an improved interaction with the avian receptor. The A(0.236)/A(0.076) ratio was found to be increased from 0.77 to 1.26, suggesting an increased pandemic potential for viruses carrying these mutations (see above). As indicated above, the prevalence of the G272S mutation in H5N1-HA sequences isolated from virus strains circulating in Egypt has strongly increased since 2009, particularly in viruses isolated from humans (from 5.6% in 2009 to 95.7% in 2011, see Supplementary  Table S1 ). Furthermore, the (only) two HA sequences determined in 2012 for Egyptian isolates of human HAPIV were shown to carry the double mutation G272S/S223N.",

QT6 is known to primarily express \u03b1 2,3-SA (the avian IAV-type receptor), while MDCK-SIAT1 mainly expresses \u03b1 2,6-SA (the human IAV-type receptor). Expression levels of the two receptors were determined by differential lectin-binding analysis (Fig. 3) . Varying concentrations of biotinylated lectins, MAAII specific for \u03b1 2,3-SA and SNA/EBL specific for \u03b1 2,6-SA, were added to the cells and cell-bound lectins were quantified by FACS analysis using PE-labelled streptavidine. A549 cells, which were used to determine the titers of our PRP stocks, were included as control (Fig. 3) . As expected, both types of lectins were bound by A549 cells at high levels, indicating good expression of both receptor types (Fig. 3a,b) . In contrast, QT6 cells only bound to MAAII lectin, whereas SNA/ EBL binding was not detectable, not even at the highest lectin concentration used (100 ng) (Fig. 3b) . MDCK-SIAT1 cells were shown to bind both types of lectins, indicating the presence of both receptors. However, the amount of \u03b1 2,6-SA was significantly increased compared to A549 control cells (Fig. 3b) . The differential expression of both receptors on these cell lines was confirmed by confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 3c) . Based on these observations, we decided to use QT6 cells (expressing predominantly avian IAV receptors) and MDCK-SIAT1 cells (overexpressing human IAV receptors) in subsequent differential infectivity experiments.",

The fact that the number of human cases in Egypt did not increase more dramatically in recent years might reflect a need for further adaptive requirements, for example in the receptor binding domain. Interestingly, S223N substitutions were only detected in human samples and combinations of the two aa substitutions were detected in both human H5N1 HPAIV HA sequences reported in 2012, further supporting the significance of these aa substitutions in viral adaptation to human hosts and suggesting an increased pandemic potential for H5N1 HPAIV strains currently circulating in Egypt (Supplementary  Table S1 ).",

Amino acid mutations K153R and S223N/G were shown to alter the antigenic properties and/or receptor specificity 34,46-48 . However, it is currently not clear if the recently reported adaptive substitution G272S in the H5-HA protein of Egyptian isolates has similar effects on the receptor specificity 20 . In a recent attempt to establish a model that predicts the evolution of the viral population, the analysis of 3,944 HA sequences from H3N2 IAV revealed that adaptive mutations, which influence biological and immunological properties of these viruses, occur with highest probability within the epitopes A-D 49 . The alterations at the three selected positions (153, 223, 272) investigated here are also located within epitopes A, B and C, suggesting that with high probability such variations can be expected to occur also in H5-type HA of HPAIV as a consequence of natural viral adaptation.",

Notably, ISM analyses of double and triple mutations consistently showed a decrease in amplitude at the frequency for avian receptor usage (0.076) accompanied by an increase at the frequency for human receptor usage (0.236). This was more pronounced for the triple mutation (Supplementary  Table S2 ). Even though the triple mutations substantially decreased the amplitude of the avian frequency compared to wildtype (Supplementary Table S2 ), the results shown in Fig. 7B indicate no decrease of viral replication in QT6 cells. We think that combinations of mutations do not only affect long-range interaction properties of HA1 but may also affect its 3D structure. For this reason, the triple mutation (even though it increases the calculated efficacy of recognition and targeting between HA1 and the human receptor) might not necessarily disturb the chemical binding to the avian receptor.",

Previously, studies into the pandemic potential for humans were largely focused on HPAIV of the H5N1 and H7N3/H7N7 subtypes. While H5N1 HPAIV are known to cause severe disease in humans and many birds, the H7-type is generally associated with mild disease in humans but causes fatal disease in a wide range of birds including economically relevant species (chicken, turkeys, etc.) 52, 53 . However, recent work shows that also specific H7-type HPAIV strains have the potential to replicate in mammalian species 40, 54 . These observations have led to more extensive research and monitoring efforts to better understand the specific pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics of these HPAIV. Additionally, the large group of LPAIV and the recently documented H7N9, H10N8 and H6N1 LPAIV cases in humans extend the list of subtypes potentially causing human disease and thus deserve further studies 55, 56 . The increasing number of cases with IAV subtypes not considered previously to cause disease in humans highlights the need to develop new tools (including in silico methods) that are suitable to closely monitor the biological properties (tropism, pathogenic potential in specific species, etc.) of circulating IAV strains and identify mutations indicative of CPIV. These tools might help the health authorities, healthcare systems, and vaccine manufacturers to plan ahead and respond earlier to newly emerging IAVs with pandemic potential. The bioinformatic method used in the present study to define mutations in H5N1 IAV that indicate viral adaptation to humans and thus increase the pandemic potential of these viruses may be a suitable tool to identify CPIV among circulating influenza viruses in different populations.",
