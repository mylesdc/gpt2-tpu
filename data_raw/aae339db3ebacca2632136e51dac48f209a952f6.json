We demonstrate that chicken tracheal ciliated cells express a2,3-linked SA, while goblet cells mainly express a2,6-linked SA. In addition, the plant lectin MAL-II, but not MAA/MAL-I, is bound to the surface of goblet cells, suggesting that SA2,3-linked oligosaccharides with Galb1-3GalNAc subterminal residues are specifically present on the goblet cells. Moreover, both a2,3and a2,6-linked SAs are detected on single tracheal basal cells. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) avian influenza virus H6N1 is exclusively detected in the ciliated cells, suggesting that the ciliated cell is the major target cell of the H6N1 virus. At a MOI of 1, ciliated, goblet and basal cells are all permissive to the AIV infection. This result clearly elucidates the receptor distribution for the avian influenza virus among chicken tracheal epithelial cells and illustrates a primary cell model for evaluating the cell tropisms of respiratory viruses in poultry.",

Two types of M. amurensis lectins were discovered: one that can agglutinate erythrocytes (hemagglutinin) (MAH, also known as MAL-II) and one that can agglutinate leukocytes (MAL, also known as MAM, MAA, MAL-I). Although both MAL-I and MAL-II recognize the SAa2-3Gal glycan, previous studies [4] and recent glycan microarray data [5] demonstrated that subterminal sugars affect their binding affinity to these two lectins. For example, MAL-I, rather than MAL-II, showed the highest affinity to the SAa2-3Galb1-4GalNAc and did not bind to this oligosaccharide when the subterminal b1,4-linkage was replaced by a b1,3-linkage [6] .",

            "text": "Cell entry by influenza virus depends on the recognition of a terminal SA-capped glycosylated molecules by the viral hemag-glutinin (HA) protein [3] . Generally, human influenza viruses preferentially bind to cell surface oligosaccharides that have the SAa2-6Gal linkage, while avian influenza viruses (AIVs) prefer SAa2-3Gal [3] . Especially, the glycans containing the SAa2-3Galb1-4GalNAc or SAa2-3Galb1-4(6OSO3)GalNAc, show a high affinity to MAA/MAL-I [4] and AIVs [7, 8] . Tracheal/ bronchial epithelium, mainly consisting of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells, is the initially attacked tissue by the invading influenza viruses. The infected chicken trachea shows necrosis and detachment of ciliated cells, suggesting that ciliated cell is one of the cells targeted by AIV [9] . Previous analyses of the expression of SAs in chicken have revealed that a2,3-linked SA was localized on tracheal ciliated cells and a2,6-linked SAs was also present in the tracheal tissues [10, 11, 12] . However, the detailed distribution of SAs among chicken tracheal epithelial (CTE) cells remains unclear. Clarification of the distribution and the expression intensity of influenza receptor on CTE cells will help us to understand the viral tropism, viral spreading and the pathogenesis of avian influenza viruses. Here, the SA distribution on CTE cells were identified by the staining of biotin-labeled plant lectins. A Taiwan-isolated AIV H6N1 was applied to characterize the cell tropism of AIV and the correlation of the cell tropism of AIV to the SA distribution on CTE cells was also explored.",

These results indicate that the ciliated cell, rather than the goblet or the basal cells, is the primary target cell for the AIV.

Our previous study indicated that the replication of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is restricted to ciliated cells and goblet cells, but not basal cells [21] . The tracheal/bronchial basal cells, assumed as multipotent stem cells, are responsible for epithelial recovery and reestablish normal respiratory function after desquamation of the ciliated and goblet cells [14, 15] . In an uncomplicated IBV-infected chick, clinical signs persist for only 1 week and the unaffected basal cells may be responsible for epithelial reconstruction of the injured respiratory tract [22] . In contrast, basal cells are susceptible to the infection of avian influenza virus at a MOI of 1. The susceptibility of basal cells to AIV infection suggests that infection with AIV alone may cause the cell death of basal cells, and consequently affect basal membrane integrity and severe inflammation in the AIV infected trachea.",

In chickens, MAL-I bind to the surface of ciliated cells and basal cells, but not goblet cells. The goblet cells express a MAL-II specific SAa2-3Gal glycan. In addition, both SNA and SNA-I failed to label the btubulin + cells, indicating that SAa2-6Gal is exclusively expressed on non-ciliated cells. In humans, by contrast, both ciliated and goblet cells can be labeled with MAA/MAL-I and SNA [19, 20] , indicating that these two epithelial cells have both types of influenza viral receptors. Moreover, both ciliated and goblet cells cells are permissive to infection by human influenza viruses [19, 20] . Interestingly, using duck influenza A viruses to infect human airway epithelial cells, the viral antigen could only be detected in the ciliated cells, but not in the goblet cells, possibly due to the low SAa2-3Gal expression on the surface of goblet cells and a low MOI infection [19, 20] .",

Especially, this secreted mucin was shown to prevent infection by influenza viruses with a SAa2-3Gal preference in the airway [26] . This false-receptor effect may mask the HA of the AIV, disable the viral access to the goblet cells and also account, at least in part, for the hindrance of AIV infection to human goblet cell [26] . In chicken trachea, goblet cells exhibit high affinity for SNA, suggesting that the mucin may contain SAa2-6Gal glycans. The viral neutralization effect of mucin in humans may be recapitulated in chickens to aid the clearance of the invading influenza viruses with a SAa2-6Gal preference.",

Notably, although AIVs can bind to the terminal SAa2-3Gal, duck and chicken influenza viruses exhibit different affinities for glycans with different subterminal residues [7, 8] . For example, duck influenza viruses prefer Galb1-3GlcNAc or Galb1-3GalNAc, but chicken influenza viruses prefer Galb1-4GlcNAc or Galb1-4(6OSO3)GlcNAc [7, 8] . Our study suggests that SAa2,3-capped oligosaccharides following a Galb1,3-linkage [6] are candidate sugars conjugated to the chicken tracheal mucin protein. Determining the SA composites of chicken mucin protein and the neutralizing effect of chicken mucin on duck influenza viruses will be an interesting task that will provide important information about the innate defense mechanisms in the chicken trachea and about the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses between ducks and chickens.",

In addition, at a low MOI, most H6N1 proteins were detected in the SAa2-3Gal-rich ciliated cells, and few in the goblet and basal cells. These results indicate that the chicken H6N1 virus, even with a Ser228 (using H3 HA numbering) in its HA, still possesses a SAa2-3Gal preference. Similarly, the HA 226 residue, critical to cell tropism in human H3 and H9N2, has been shown to be an insufficient binding site for determining the receptor tropism of the human H1, H2, H5 and the avian H6, H9 and H5N1 viruses [4, 33, 34, 35] .

The procedure for removing epithelial sheets from the tracheas and the detailed culture conditions for the CTE cells have been described previously [21] . Briefly, tracheas were digested with dispase I solution (2.5 U/ml dispase I, Roche) for 2 h at 37uC. The detached cell sheets of tracheal epithelium from the tracheal lumen were harvested and further digested with collagenase I (1 mg/ml, Roche) for 5 min at 37uC. The disrupted tracheal epithelial sheets were gently pippeted and homogenized into small cell clumps. The cell pellets were resuspended in a CTE medium [21] and were seeded on 2% matrigel-coated 24-well plates (Corning). The cells were cultured at 37uC with 5% CO 2 for 3 days. The animal use protocol in this study had been reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in National Chung Hsing University. The approval number is 99-09.",
