            "text": "Viral sewage metagenomics is a novel field of study used for surveillance, epidemiological studies, and evaluation of waste water treatment efficiency. In raw sewage human waste is mixed with household, industrial and drainage water, and virus particles are, therefore, only found in low concentrations. This necessitates a step of sample concentration to allow for sensitive virus detection. Additionally, viruses harbor a large diversity of both surface and genome structures, which makes universal viral genomic extraction difficult. Current studies have tackled these challenges in many different ways employing a wide range of viral concentration and extraction procedures. However, there is limited knowledge of the efficacy and inherent biases associated with these methods in respect to viral sewage metagenomics, hampering the development of this field. By the use of next generation sequencing this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of four commonly applied viral concentrations techniques (precipitation with polyethylene glycol, organic flocculation with skim milk, monolithic adsorption filtration and glass wool filtration) and extraction methods (Nucleospin RNA XS, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, NucliSENS \u00ae miniMAG \u00ae , or PowerViral \u00ae Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit) to determine the viriome in a sewage sample. We found a significant influence of concentration and extraction protocols on the detected viriome. The viral richness was largest in samples extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or PowerViral \u00ae Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit. Highest viral specificity were found in samples concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol or extracted with Nucleospin RNA XS. Detection of viral pathogens depended on the method used. These results contribute to the understanding of method associated biases, within the field of PLOS ONE |",

            "text": "Within raw sewage, feces, urine and other biological fluids from thousands of humans are mixed together with food and household waste, industrial waste, and runoff water. Every individual, who is connected to the drainage system, contributes with his or hers own microbiota [1] , including infecting pathogens [2] . This makes sewage an attractive matrix for epidemiological studies [3] , microbial source tracking [4] , and for controlling the efficacy of pathogen removal in wastewater treatment plants [5, 6] . Sewage has been shown to harbor a diverse viral population including enteric, respiratory and oncogenic viruses [7] . The high viral diversity and the continuous mutation of viral species makes identification with traditional methods difficult and time consuming, therefore many studies have turned to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches instead [7] [8] [9] . Metagenomic sequencing of the virus associated nucleic acids is considered to be an unbiased approach enabling the detection of all known viral species, as well as the discovery of novel and emergent species [10] . Three main challenges exist for viral sewage metagenomics. First, only a small fraction of the total nucleic acids are of known viral origin, hence mechanical and enzymatic viral purification is often needed [9] . Second, the low abundance of viral particles in the samples requires the use of viral concentration methods prior to nucleic acid extraction [11] and is often combined with subsequent random DNA amplification [12] . Third, the nucleic acid extraction procedure has to cover the large variety in viral structures and genome types. To overcome these biases, different methods to concentrate viruses from water samples have been developed, including: polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) [8] , FeCl 3 precipitation [13] , skimmed milk flocculation (SMF) [14] , glass wool filtration (GW) [15] or monolithic adsorption filtration (MAF) [16] . The influence of concentration method on viral recovery has been evaluated on sea water [17] , spiked tap water [15, 18] and raw sewage [19] , cautioning of method associated biases. To our knowledge, no major comparison studies using metagenomics have been performed with sewage water.",

An 80:20 mixture of toluene and tert-buthyl methyl ether was used as porogen to create monoliths with a pore size of ca. 20 \u03bcm. After synthesis, functionalization was performed by recirculating 10% diethylamine in 50% ethanol at 60\u02daC through the monolithic disks for 3 h to create positively charged diethylaminoethyl groups on the pore surface. Afterwards the monoliths were rinsed with ultrapure water and stored at 4\u02daC until further use.

To allow for better visualization of the effect of concentration and extraction on the sewage samples, they were not included in Figs 1 and 2. Sample replicates extracted with NUC clustered away from the samples extracted with the other methods, when concentrated with PEG ( Fig 1D) . This was also true for the concentrates from MAF (Fig 1A) , SMF (Fig 1B) , and GW (Fig 1C) , suggesting that the viral community composition of the NUC extractions differed from the other tested extraction methods. The samples extracted with POW and MIN clustered together, suggesting similar viral community compositions (Fig 1A-1D) . The samples extracted with QIA sometimes clustered separately (Fig 1A and 1C ) and sometimes together with the samples extracted with POW and MIN ( Fig  1B and 1D) .

In this study we included the measure to discern if some methods were better at catching the entire spectrum of viral species. Our results show that the choice of extraction method is of more importance than the choice of concentration method with regard to viral richness. However, samples concentrated with GW had a slightly higher richness compared to the other concentration methods (Fig 4A) . The low mean richness of the samples extracted with NUC can probably be explained by the DNase step, degrading the genomes of DNA viruses and the species rich bacteriophages [44] . Viral specificity, or how large a fraction of the sequencing reads is of viral origin, is important for sensitivity reasons, increasing the chance to detect rare or less abundant species. A high viral specificity also has financial implications, causing large savings on both sequencing, and for subsequent CPU hours used in the bioinformatics analyses. In this study, the PEG protocol was the best concentration method, in respect to viral specificity (Fig 3A) . This might be explained by the initial filtration step, not part of the other evaluated protocols. Pre-filtration might have improved the viral specificity in the other concentration methods, although clotting might become a problem due to the increased volumes processed with these methods. The NUC had a consistent high viral specificity (three times that of POW and QIA), probably due to the effective removal of DNA from other organisms, and contaminants, during the DNase step. Overall, there was a 10-fold difference in viral specificity between the lowest and the highest method combination, highlighting the potential savings associated with choice of method. We observed a generally high viral specificity in this study compared to previous studies [45] . This might be due to the addition of the spiked HAdV, inflating the amount of virus in the sewage matrix, but should not have any influence on the method comparisons.",

In addition, SMF failed to detect the low numbers of reads of polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses observed by the other methods.",

Inhibitors can affect PCR amplification, quality of the prepared library, and subsequent virus detection. This theory was further supported by the qPCR results were extracts obtained from SMF had a high level of inhibition. Extraction with QIA has previously been shown to impair detection of HAdV in samples with high levels of organic matter [23] . This was also the case in our study, where extraction with QIA inhibited HAdV detection in all cases except when combined with PEG concentration which both had the lowest starting volume (0.2 L) and an additional filtration step.",

Virus species specific extraction efficiency biases are well documented in viral metagenomics [54] and should always be considered when interpreting the results.

Samtools [37] were used to remove singletons and filter reads where neither a read nor its mate is mapped. Reads were mapped in bestmode, meaning that mapping was performed against all databases, simultaneously, and later for each read pair the best hit among all alignments is chosen. A pair of reads is considered as a hit only if the sum of the alignment scores (SAS) is higher than any SAS values from other database hits. If a pair of reads has identical SAS values when mapping to several databases, the only one pair, associated with the database that was specified first in the list of reference databases, is kept. In the last, post-processing step, alignments are filtered based on matches/mis-matches threshold. In this analysis, 70% matches/mis-matches threshold needed to be satisfied in order the hit to be considered significant. The metagenomic sequences are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) under accession number PRJEB15242. Viral richness was estimated using the program CatchAll [38] and the non-parametric Chao1 richness index, as a measure of number of viral species in a sample.
