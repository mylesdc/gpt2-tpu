Other emergent viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are responsible for more severe symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome. [6] [7] [8] Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays have been shown to be a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of these viruses. Furthermore, the introduction of multiplex rRT-PCR enables the set-up of assays detecting two or more targets in single clinical specimen. 9, 10 In 2007, the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun (CPC) began implementing sentinel surveillance for influenza in Cameroon. This surveillance system has enabled a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in the country. 11, 12 Even though our recent publication has demonstrated that those respiratory viruses play an important role in patients consulting our sentinel sites, 13 there remains a lack of information regarding patients hospitalized with SARI.",

Testing for influenza A and B viruses were conducted, and influenza A virus-positive specimens were subtyped according to the method developed by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 15 Then, the detection of 14 non-influenza respiratory viruses, including hMPV, hRSV, hPIV (1-4), EV, RV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1, hAdV, and hBoV were performed by 4 duplex rRT-PCR, using a commercially available Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene TM (bioM erieux, Lyon, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications were performed on ABI 7500 Fast (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A patient was considered to have a single viral infection if only one pathogen was detected in the specimens. In case of more than one viral pathogen detected, patients were considered to have viral coinfections.",

            "text": "Of 347 samples tested, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 227 (64\u00c15%). This detection rate is consistent with results of other etiologic studies of hospitalized children conducted in similar settings. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Nonetheless, this proportion appears to vary largely between countries. Kwofie et al. recorded a lower percentage of 25\u00c17% in Ghana 21 and Khor et al. recorded 26\u00c14% in Malaysia. 22 Higher percentages 94\u00c12% in China, 23 91% in France, 24 and 90% in Alaska 25 were reported by Zhang et al., Singleton et al., and Huguenin et al., respectively. Comparison among published studies is always difficult. Possible reasons for these varying outcomes among studies include true differences in epidemiology, differences in the inclusion criteria for study population, diagnostic methods used, panel of viral agents tested, climate, study duration, and patients' ages. Consider that all the above studies included hospitalized children; lower prevalence recorded by Khor et al. might have been due to their 27-year study duration and laboratory methods (direct IF and viral isolation) which are known to be less sensitive than molecular techniques. 25 The most prevalent virus detected in our study was AdV, representing 27\u00c13% of the total number of viruses observed. This value is higher than that (0\u00c18-13\u00c13%) reported in most other similar studies. 16, 17, 22, [26] [27] [28] It is nonetheless similar to what was noted in Alaska 24 particularly. This finding shows that AdV could play a more significant role than originally thought. Accordingly, additional efforts describing our associated serotypes will help to further understand how much this virus contributes to disease severity. Unlike our results, most similar studies showed that hRSV was the most prevalent viral pathogen. 22, [31] [32] [33] In our study, hRSV was the second most frequent pathogen after hAdV with merely 13\u00c12% of 347 hospitalized children testing positive. However, this proportion was similar to that reported in other studies (5\u00c17-15%). 16, 28, 29, 34 Unlike previous similar studies, RV/EV accounted for only 11\u00c15% of positivity in our study. 17, 18, 24, 26, 29 HBoV was the fourth most common virus with a prevalence of 10\u00c16% in all cases. This result is in line with the results of others authors, who have reported a worldwide detection rate of hBoV ranges between 2 and 19% in nasopharyngeal samples. 35 The remaining viral etiologies were identified in 9\u00c18%, 6\u00c16%, 5\u00c17%, and 2\u00c13% for influenza, HPIV, HCoV, and HMPV, respectively. These results correspond with those reported by other authors. 23, 27, 32, 33, 36, 37 As previously shown, we also found that virus-associated hospitalization figures were significantly higher among children (P = 0\u00c103). 27, 28, 38 According to reports, there is always a higher incidence of viral respiratory infection in children than in adults. This may be partially explained by the lower detection rate of respiratory viruses in the elderly due to reduced viral shedding in older age groups. 39 HRSV, the second most commonly virus detected in this study, has been reported to be the leading cause of SARI in young children. 19, 22, 36 Nevertheless, we did not find a significant age-specific prevalence in HRSV detection during this study. This was probably due to the fact that our statistical analysis was hampered by the limited size of study participants older than 5 years. Headaches were negatively associated with positives samples (P = 0\u00c1003). However, as a majority of our study population was made up of children unable to report headaches, only 46 patients (13\u00c13%) were taken into account in the analysis.Multiple viral infections were observed in 29\u00c15% of the patients with positive viral detection. This is a very similar percentage to the one found by others researchers. 22, 26, 37 Bocavirus has been frequently implicated in coinfections. 17, 19, 25 Our results reflect those of other studies in which hBoV was associated (35\u00c18% versus 8\u00c11%, P < 0\u00c1001) with multiple infections. Surprisingly, AdV and picornaviruses were also most frequently involved in coinfections, which probably resulted from the fact that they were detected throughout the year and were among the most prevalent.",

We found that RSV cases were detected mainly during the major rainfalls from September to November, which is consistent with the data in the literature. 22, 23, 31 The seasonality of influenza virus is very uncertain in tropical areas. The current study did not confirm that influenza circulated between September and November, as shown in our previous studies. 13 This fact might have contributed to the reduction in the inclusion rate during the second period due to a true change in the epidemiology of SARI. Indeed, that would have contributed to reduce the numbers eligible patients in the second period of the study. RV/EV and AdV circulated year-round, a finding reported in other studies. 17, 23, 28 For the remaining viruses, no evident temporal patterns were observed.

Firstly, our study was conducted at only one site, which might have underestimated the overall detection rate for selected viruses. Likewise, the enrolled cases may not be generalizable for the entire population of children in Cameroon. Subsequently, as discussed by Broor et al., 38 there is no denial that some respiratory viruses can be detected in asymptomatic children 24, 40, 41 or shed for long periods of time after infection. 24, 42 Hence, the role played by the viruses detected in these SARI cases is less clear considering that we did not evaluate respiratory specimens from asymptomatic children without respiratory symptoms. Otherwise, despite tests for a large panel of respiratory viruses we did not evaluate bacterial etiologies, due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate samples for culture. It has been shown that bacterial pathogens may have been responsible for SARI symptoms 16 ; further studies will thus be required to specify their role in SARI in Cameroon. Lastly, although nurses in charge of recruitment were well trained, they did not systematically record severe symptoms such as convulsion, stridor, chest pain, inability to drink or breastfeed, and outcomes of study participants. This limited our ability to assert the clinical case severity and outcome of our SARI cases. This situation also added a limitation to this study regarding the representativeness of children included.",

In our resource-limited setting, this process is particularly useful for selecting only the major contributors to SARI and thereby enhancing our existing surveillance systems. Additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important to understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease. With this new method, we will also be able to evaluate the role of viral loads in respiratory infections in future research.",
