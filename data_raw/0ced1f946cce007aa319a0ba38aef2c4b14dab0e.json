After its first occurrence, SARS rapidly spread around the world along international airtravel routes, reaching all five continents and resulting in several hundreds of deaths [5] . The most recent epidemic of SARS occurred in Beijing and Anhui, China in April 2004 and originated from laboratory contamination (WHO update 7; see Further Information). Although the outbreaks seem to be over, SARS remains a safety concern because of the possible reintroduction of a SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories [6] [7] [8] . More importantly, a new recombinant virus derived from human [9], swine and/or avian influenza virus, might re-emerge as a new SARS-CoV type, much like the recent emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) in humans. Thus, it is essential to develop various and distinct strategies to combat this highly contagious disease.",

Hence, both humoral and cellular immune responses appear to be crucial for the clearance of SARS-CoV infection. Immune responses can be raised directly against several of the SARS-CoV proteins [13] [14] [15] . Targeting the spike (S) structural glycoprotein [12, [16] [17] [18] in particular induces a robust immune response, suggesting it plays an important role in the systemic clearance of SARS-CoV [10] . The viral surface S protein is involved in host cell receptor recognition, virus attachment and entry [19] ; adaptive evolution of S protein, thus, contributes to SARS-CoV overcoming the species barrier [20] . Hence, many vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV target the S protein [19] . Considering that cytotoxic T-cell responses participate in the clearance of virus from recovered SARS patients and contribute to immunopathology in early stages of the disease [21] , one of the most attractive S protein-based strategies proposes eliciting a SARS-CoV CTL response to clear the infection. To this end, a detailed understanding of the S protein-mediated CTL response is essential.",

The identification of HLA-A*0201-restricted SARS-CoV/S CTL epitopes is an important contribution towards understanding the role of CTLs in SARS-CoV pathogenesis and protection. Currently, several CTL-specific SARS-CoV S protein epitopes have been identified in the context of HLA-A*0201, including S 411-420 , S 787-795 , S 978-986 , S 1042-1050 , S 1167-1175 , S 1203-1211 and SSp-1 [23-26], and the H2 complex, including S 366-374 , S 436-443 , S 525-532 and S 1031-1047 [18, 27] . It is likely that additional S protein CTL epitopes exist.

In turn, this data will provide advances towards understanding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection, and contribute to the development of future SARS-CoV infection intervention strategies.",

Based on a binding affinity-based prediction and a proteosomal cleavage site prediction, we constructed a panel of potential HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL peptides from the S protein. Each candidate peptide was evaluated for its binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules using the T2 cell-peptide binding test. We then evaluated the ability of HLA-A*0201 binding peptides to provoke CTL responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). PBL preparations from major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched healthy donors or HLA-A2.1/ K b transgenic (Tg) mice, were incubated with dendritic cells (DCs) that had been pre-pulsed with the peptides of interest. We identified a novel SARS-CoV S proteinderived CTL epitope S (958-966) (VLNDILSRL) that was capable of priming the S protein-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL response. The effective CTL response was evidenced by cell death of peptide-pulsed T2 and peptide-pulsed Jurkat-A2/K b cells. The findings of this study should provide insight into the immunological characteristics of spike protein and provide an alternative strategy for the future development of SARS-CoV S protein CTL epitope-based vaccines.",

After alignment of the amino acid residues of S protein with eighteen SARS-CoV strains (Figure 1 ), the BJ01 strain S protein was selected to predict the S protein specific, HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes. Based on the presence of HLA-A*0201 binding motifs and the cleavage sites for proteasomes and immunoproteasomes, eight candidate peptides were predicted and synthesized ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ), termed Sp1-8.

T2 cells lack the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), a key factor involved in endogenous antigen processing and presentation, causing the empty HLA-I molecules on the T2 cell surface to be very unstable and to degrade rapidly after cell surface presentation. However, when exogenous epitope peptides bind to the HLA-I molecules on the cell surface, they become stable [28, 29] . Accordingly, the peptide-induced upregulation of HLA-I on TAP-deficient T2 cells is used to monitor peptide binding to class I molecules, which then indicates the binding affinity of peptides to HLA-I molecules. Higheraffinity peptides will induce more HLA-A*0201 expression on the cell surface than will lower-affinity peptides.

Furthermore, the CTL response levels correlate with disease outcome [12] , suggesting CTL response is crucial for the clearance of SARS-CoV. Among all the encoded proteins in the SARS-CoV genome, S protein is currently considered the most important target to prime the host immune response [12, [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that an inflammatory cell influx of airway macrophages and a massive release of cytokines occur during the peak of SARS infection [30] . Thus, it is In this study, we predicted and validated a novel CTL epitope of SARS-CoV S protein. We used two prediction systems to identify candidate CTL epitopes of S protein (i.e., HLA-A2-binding peptide prediction method combined with a proteosomal cleavage site prediction system) to improve prediction accuracy. The eight predicted peptides were then verified via MHC peptide binding assay (Table 1) . Among the eight candidate peptides, Sp5, Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 exhibited the highest capacity to induce more potent CTLs secreting IFN-\u03b3 and to lyse target cells from HLA-A*0201-matched healthy donor PBLs ( Figure  2 ). Further in vivo investigation showed that plasmid encoding the full-length SARS-CoV S gene elicited strong CTL response in HLA-A2.1/K b transgenic mice. These CTLs could produce substantial amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and kill target cells in a peptide-specific and HLA-A*0201-restricted manner (Figure 3 ), suggesting the predicted candidate peptides were native epitopes, capable of priming CTL responses in vivo. We found that candidate peptide Sp8 held the greatest ability to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and kill target cells in vivo (Figure 3 ). Another candidate peptide, Sp7, failed to induce the most potent peptide specific CTLs in Tg mice (Figure 3 ), despite it having had the highest such ability in comparison to the rest of the in vitro stimulation set (Figure 2 [18, 27] . In this study, we predicted and validated a novel CTL epitope of SARS-CoV S protein, Sp8 (S 958 , VLNDILSRL). This may be due to the unique predictive methods used in our study. We combined strategies for prediction (i.e., HLA-A2-binding peptide prediction method combined with a proteosomal cleavage site prediction system). Previous studies used single methods, such as HLA peptide binding prediction or overlapping peptide strategy [18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , suggesting different prediction strategies might lead to different results. In any case, the predicted candidate peptides require additional validation methods to ensure accuracy.",

The predictive algorithm, \"ProPred1\"[31], is a matrix-based method that allows the prediction of MHC binding sites in an antigenic sequence for 47 MHC class-I alleles. We restricted our analysis to the HLA-A2 allele, since it is prevalent in a large percentage of all major ethnicities and it is the most extensively studied HLA class-I antigen [22] . ProPred1 also allows the prediction of the standard proteasomal and immunoproteasomales cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence. The simultaneous prediction of MHC binding and proteasomal cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence leads to the identification of potential T-cell epitopes. The second algorithm, \"SYFPEITHI\", was developed by H. G. Rammensee et al [32] , and ranks peptides according to a score that takes into account the presence of primary and secondary MHC-binding anchor residues.",

Then peptide-pulsed T2 cells and/or J(A2/kb) cells were labeled with 51 Cr sodium chromate (Na 51 CrO 4 , Perkin-Elmer Life Science, Boston, MA) for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. 51 Cr-labeled target cells were washed three times and mixed with graded doses of effectors in 96-well plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours, a total of 100 \u03bcl supernatant was collected from each well and radioactivity was counted with a gamma counter. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Percent specific lysis was determined according to the following formula: percent specific lysis = [(mean experimental cpm -mean spontaneous cpm)/(mean maximum cpm -mean spontaneous cpm)] \u00d7 100%. Spontaneous and maximum releases were determined by incubating the labeled targets with medium alone or 1 M HCl, respectively. Spontaneous release was always < 15% of maximum release.",

Autologous DCs were pulsed with 20 \u03bcg/ml candidate peptides and used as stimulators for HLA-A2.1 + PBLs from the immunized mice. Effector cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 ) and stimulator cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 ) were seeded into 96-well polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-backed microplates pre-coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours, cells were removed and plates processed as described in the instruction. Resulting spots were counted with a stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) under magnifications of \u00d720 to \u00d740. Only brown and/or blue colored spots with fuzzy borders were scored as spot-forming cells (SFCs). As a positive control, S 411-420 -loaded DCs were used as stimulator cells. The HBcAg (131-140) -loaded DCs, DCs alone, and medium were used as negative controls. Negative control values were always < 20 SFC per 10 6 input cells. Results were considered positive when at least 120 SFC/10 6 PBL were detected. Each assay was run in triplicate and results were representative of three experiments.",
