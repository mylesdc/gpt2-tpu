            "text": "An Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa of unprecedented severity resulted in over 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths as of April 2016 (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/previous-case-counts. html). EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) are closely related filoviruses, with a nucleotide identity of 49.5%. They contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a negative orientation that are approximately 19 kb in size and encode seven structural proteins 1 . The natural hosts of filoviruses are presumed to be bats 2 , which may be the origin of the recent EBOV outbreak in West Africa 3 . Rousettus aegyptiacus is the natural reservoir of MARV [4] [5] [6] , and it survives MARV infections without any signs of the disease 7, 8 . However, humans with filovirus infections experience a severe fever and vascular leakage, with high fatality rates 9 . Surprisingly little is known about the response of human cells to EBOV and MARV infections, and the response in bat cells has not been investigated at all. Barrenas et al. 10 used a next-generation sequencing approach to understand the cellular immune response of vaccinated cynomolgus macaques after an EBOV challenge. Microarray-based studies have described the differential expression of several known cellular genes after EBOV infections in mice and rhesus monkeys [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the overall response of human and bat cells to filovirus infections is not yet known. Key proteins in the infection process and their regulatory circuits have not been defined, and the transcriptional landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and alternative mRNA isoforms is unexplored. Cellular targets are an attractive alternative for the development of antiviral drugs because viruses cannot adapt to a change in the host cell as easily as they can develop a resistance to an antiviral drug over the course of treatment 15, 16 . To establish effective antiviral strategies, it is necessary to understand how the infected cells respond to filovirus infections and how this response differs between bats and humans. We explored the cellular regulatory response mechanisms by sequencing the full transcriptomes of immortalized cells of human and bat origin at three different time points post infection (p.i.). We constructed a full de novo transcriptome assembly (see Materials and Methods) based on the RNA-Seq data of R. aegyptiacus.",

            "text": "Cells and RNA extractions. We infected 4 \u00d7 10 5 HuH7 cells 17 (a human hepatoma cell line) and 4 \u00d7 10 5 R06E-J cells 18 (an embryonic cell line from R. aegyptiacus) with EBOV (Ebola virus strain Zaire, Mayinga, GenBank: NC_002549) or MARV (Lake Victoria Marburg virus, Leiden, GenBank: JN408064.1 19 ) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of three (Fig. 1A) . We used HuH7 cells because EBOV infections in humans induce the majority of their histopathological features in the liver, and these cells are highly susceptible to filovirus infections 20 . We used immortalized cells because primary cells from bats (macrophages and dendritic cells) are not available in the large quantities we required for our RNA-Seq analyses (9 samples from each cell type). Our analyses consisted of computational and extensive manual investigations as shown in Fig. 2 . At 3, 7 and 23 h p.i., cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These time points correspond to the different stages of the viral replication cycle (Fig. 3) . Replication and transcription take place after 3 h, proteins are produced at 7 h, which may regulate further transcription, and a complete replication cycle occurs after 23 h. DNaseI digestion was performed. At each time point, RNA was also isolated from non-infected (Mock) control cells. Quality controls were performed to ensure proper infection rates and viral propagation. Real-time PCR was used to detect filovirus RNA (polymerase genes) 21 and to demonstrate the amplification of viral RNA over the time course of the infections (Fig. 1B) . Ct-values are inversely proportional to the amount RNA detected, and these values for the MARV-infected HuH7 cells at 3 and 7 h p.i. were lower than the values for the MARV-infected R06E-J cells. The Ct-values for the EBOV-infected cells showed no clear difference. An immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of the cells was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against nucleoproteins of EBOV (B6C5, 1:20) and MARV (59-9-10, 1:100). An anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled with Alexa 594 (1:500) was used to detect these viral nucleoproteins, and DAPI (4\u2032 ,6\u2032 -diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was used to visualize cell nuclei (1 mg/ml, 1:2000) . IFAs of the MARV and EBOV nucleoproteins revealed that a MOI of 3 was sufficient to initially infect a high percentage of cells (90% of human and bat cells infected with EBOV, 70% of bat cells and 99% of human cells infected with MARV, Fig. 1C /D). The quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Nine samples at different time points were generated from human cells (HuH7-Mock-3h, HuH7-Mock-7h, HuH7-Mock-23h, HuH7-EBOV-3h, HuH7-EBOV-7h, HuH7-EBOV-23h, HuH7-MARV-3h, HuH7-MARV-7h, HuH7-MARV-23h) and bat (R06E-J-Mock-3h, R06E-J-Mock-7h, R06E-J-Mock-23h, R06E-J-EBOV-3h, R06E-J-EBOV-7h, R06E-J-EBOV-23h, R06E-J-MARV-3h, R06E-J-MARV-7h, R06E-J-MARV-23h).",

R06E-J cells were stimulated with interferons, PolyIC or thapsigargin to mimic the induction of the interferon system or a stress response by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cells. Prior to stimulation, R06E-J cells were examined for interferon competence via a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bioassay. The cells secreted cytokines after PolyIC transfection, and those cytokines partially protected R06E-J cells from VSV infection (data not shown). RNA was isolated from these cells, pooled with the 9 previously mentioned R. aegyptiacus cell samples and shipped to GATC Biotech for normalization and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system (2 \u00d7 300 nt mode). This library of longer paired-end reads was used to improve the de novo transcriptome assembly of R. aegyptiacus. All reads were preprocessed based on their Phred quality score.

For the human transcriptome assembly, we found between 93.0% and 98.1% of the expressed transcripts, and for R. aegyptiacus 81.3-94.0%. Therefore, the transcriptome assemblies were of sufficient quality. The results for different transcript subsets are shown in Table S3 . Most of the missing transcripts can be explained by a low read coverage in comparison to the length of the transcript or a non-uniform distribution of reads along the transcript. These transcripts may be assembled as partial contigs (alignment length \u2264 90%).

To accomplish this, 40 scientists with experience in analyzing RNA-Seq data came together to \"Fight against Ebola\" and manually investigated each gene. During this \"hackathon\", we investigated 1,500 genes (7.5% of human protein-coding genes). Each gene was analyzed in detail using the IGV and UCSC browsers. The gene, its synonyms, functional information, screenshots of genomic locations, isoforms, fold changes and maximum read counts can be found in the electronic supplement (http://www.rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/filovirus_human_bat/igo.php).",

Only ~40% (~70%) of the R06E-J cells were infected with EBOV (MARV) in comparison to ~90% (~70%) in the first experiment (Fig. 1C ). The infection rates were only slightly lower for HuH7 cells ( Figure S7E ). RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed with random hexamers. For qRT-PCR analyses of NPC1 and TLR3 gene expression, degenerate primers that amplified both the human and the bat mRNA sequences were used. HAVCR1 gene expression was measured using human-and bat-specific primers. Expression values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. All primer sequences are listed in File ES7A. qPCRs were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System using SYBR Green chemistry (iTaq mix, BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mean values from triplicate analyses were calculated and quantified with the system's built-in software according to standard curves constructed for each amplicon from serial cDNA dilutions. Relative quantification values, melting curves and agarose gel pictures for the three genes are presented in the electronic supplement, Section ES7.",

            "text": "Differences in early viral replication velocities. By comparing viral RNA levels in HuH7 and R06E-J cells, we determined that EBOV and MARV replicate more rapidly in HuH7 than in R06E-J cells between 3 and 7 h p.i. RNA synthesis slowed down in both species in the subsequent 16 h (Fig. 3) , and transcript levels were nearly identical at 23 h p.i. (Table S2 ). The EBOV and MARV viral proteins were more abundant in HuH7 than in R06E-J cells at 7 h p.i. and were present at similar levels at 23 h p.i. (Fig. 1C,D) as determined using IFAs. Early increases in the levels of viral RNA and proteins in HuH7 cells may be attributed to a faster rate of early replication of filoviruses in HuH7 cells compared to the rate in R06E-J cells. The differences in replication velocities may contribute to the different susceptibilities of HuH7 cells and R06E-J cells to filovirus infection. However, it does not explain which differences in the cellular regulatory response mechanisms are responsible for the higher RNA synthesis rate in HuH7 cells. We observed few regulatory effects at 3 and 7 h p.i. However, more than 1,670 genes were up-or down-regulated at 23 h p.i. in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells, whereas only 74 genes showed altered expression patterns in MARV-infected samples (Fig. 4A) . Chemokine ligands (CXCL1 and CXCL5), transcription factors (e.g., FOSL1, FOS, FOSB, ATF3), and genes with diverse functions (e.g., PPP1R15A, dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)) were among the 55 genes that were most strongly regulated after filovirus infections in HuH7 cells (log 2 FC > 5, Figure ES2A ). This finding is supported by previous reports 11, 14 . Each gene can be viewed along with all relevant details at our webtool: www.rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/filovirus_human_bat/igo.php. Differential expression of 2,500 genes. We aimed to answer three questions based on gene transcription levels: (1) What happens during filovirus infections in the host? (2) What are the differences in host-cell responses between EBOV and MARV infections? (3) What are the differences in how HuH7 and R06E-J cells respond after EBOV and MARV infections? Over 2,500 differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in the response to filovirus infections (Tables S4-S10). The most significant differentially expressed genes during the course of both EBOV and MARV infections between HuH7 and R06E-J cells include genes for transcription factors that regulate the expression of kinases and their antagonists and genes involved in ubiquitination processes (Fig. 4B) . Although we confirmed the previously reported dysregulation of genes involved in coagulation 11, 12, 14 , these were not among the most differentially expressed genes. With the exception of a few genes, we confirmed previously observed data based on microarray analyses of EBOV-infected HuH7 cells 12 , human macrophages 14 rhesus monkey cells 13 , and mouse cells 11 .",

            "text": "Regulation of transcription factors. Many transcription factors were found to be among the most differentially expressed genes. Therefore, we assume that they play an important role in the changes observed after filoviral infection. To identify the regulatory factors that are responsible for the observed transcriptional changes after filoviral infection in HuH7 cells, we performed motif activity response analyses with MARA 47 . MARA infers the regulatory impact (also called activity) of a regulatory motif from the changes in expression of the predicted downstream genes (targets) of that motif. For a curated collection of ~190 mammalian transcription factor binding motifs and ~90 miRNA seed families, we found 76 and 38 motifs with a change in activity (z-value > 1.5) aegyptiacus genome or transcriptome assembly are marked with a star. We identified homologous locations (LOC107508087, LOC107515336, LOC107498547) for three genes that were not directly annotated in the R. aegyptiacus genome (EP300, RPS17L, MX1). These locations were identified using our de novo transcriptome assembly (red boxes). We indicated the molecular function of each gene based on the color scheme presented in (D). (C) Highly regulated genes in EBOV-and MARV-infected HuH7 and R06E-J cells. FC -log 2 -fold change based on DESeq normalized read counts. See Supplement (Tables S5 and S6 ) and corresponding entries for detailed information. (D) The PANTHER database (v11.0) 96 was used to assign molecular functions to each of the 64 genes in (B) We further subdivided the dominant group of genes that we identified to have a general binding function. During filovirus infections, the most prominent regulatory effects were observed for genes encoding transcription factors, those regulating the NF\u03baB and MAPK pathways, their DUSP inhibitors and growth factors ( Figure ES2A and Tables S5 and S6, full tables in the electronic supplement). In addition, changes were also observed for genes that regulate protein translation (RPS17, PPP1R15A), ubiquitination (TRAF6, SQSTM1), autophagocytosis (SQSTM1) and cation transport (CHAC1, ATP2B4). We also observed the strong upregulation of genes that are involved in energy transfer (e.g., RASGEF1B). Details can be found in Tables S5-S8. Scientific RepoRts | 6:34589 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34589 in response to EBOV and MARV infections, respectively (see electronic supplement, Section ES5). Genes that are regulated by such motifs are involved in NF\u03baB signaling or cell-cycle regulation (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, we found that the FOS/JUN -motif has significantly increased activity after both EBOV and MARV infections. This result indicates that genes having FOS/JUN -motif binding sites in their promoter region are primarily up-regulated (Fig. 5) . Consistent with this, transcription factors that are associated with this motif (e.g., FOSB) were up-regulated in infected cells (Fig. 4B) . The transcription factor AP1, a homo or heterodimer of differentially expressed FOS and JUN, plays important roles in different viral infections 48, 49 . Other motifs, such as the KLF12-and the NRF1-associated motifs (Fig. 5) , are more specific to EBOV and MARV, respectively, reflecting the differences in the impacts of theses two viruses on the transcriptional landscape of infected cells. In summary, we found various motifs, including the antiviral signaling-associated motif for NF\u03baB, to have significant changes in activity (Fig. 5) . For each motif, we provide associated regulators and target genes (Section ES5).",

Unexpectedly, apart from the effect on transcription factors, the majority of genes and pathways that are relevant for viral infections did not demonstrate significant regulatory changes in response to filoviral infection (Section ES6). The majority of genes involved in innate immune responses (from Kuri et al. 50 ) were either not expressed in the human cell cultures examined here or were only slightly differentially regulated during infection (Table S11) . Consistent with this observation, some of these genes (e.g., IFITM1/2, OAS1-3) are not included in our bat transcriptome assembly, suggesting they were not transcribed. However, we did observe significantly different RNA levels for several bat homologs of innate immune response genes in filovirus-infected R06E-J cells in comparison with their levels in HuH7 cells. For example, DDX58 and ADAR demonstrated lower, and NMI higher, expression levels in EBOV-infected R06E-J cells (Table S11 ). The differences in the mRNA concentrations of these transcripts in infected HuH7 and R06E-J cells may play a role in the defense mechanisms that are active during filovirus infections. Genes encoding for proteins initiating pathways known to respond to viral infections, such as DDX58 ( Figure ES6.8) , NF\u03baB ( Figures  ES6.10 and ES6.17) , and MAPK pathways ( Figures ES6.2-6.7) , were not induced during filovirus infections in our study. Only those genes of the examined pathways that encode proteins that act as key players (see Fig. 4B ,C) were up-regulated in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells relative to their expression in R06E-J cells.",

We inspected the DDX58 pathway, which induces ISRE3, AP1 (FOS and JUN), NF\u03baB and interferon \u03b2 activation in cells 54, 55 (Figure ES6.8) . Although we observed differences between HuH7 and R06E-J cells in the levels of DDX58 and ISYNA1 mRNA, all but one gene (IKK\u03b5) related to the DDX58 pathway were expressed, but they were not differentially affected. We noted an up-regulation of the FOS (38X) and JUN (9X) genes in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells 23 h p.i. (Fig. 4B) . We observed no significant change in the genes specific to the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level. We therefore assume that regulation of the DDX58 pathway at the transcriptomic level is not a driving factor leading to the frequent fatalities observed in humans, which are not observed in bats, subsequent to filoviral infection. We investigated the relationship of the DDX58 protein to other proteins at the mRNA level, such as TRIM25, which interacts with the DDX58 pathway 56 . TRIM-family proteins are induced by interferons and are involved in antiviral cellular responses 57 . We found that several members of the TRIM-family were up-regulated in EBOV-infected cells between 3-7 h p.i. but were down-regulated from 7-23 h p.i. (Table S12 ). The corresponding bat homologs were either not expressed (e.g., TRIM71) or were not significantly differentially expressed between R06E-J and HuH7 cells (e.g., TRIM25).",

We determined that the majority of the host genes reacted in a similar manner in response to EBOV and MARV infections, which may explain the common symptoms caused by these viruses in humans. CYR61 was among the most up-regulated genes in HuH7 cells and was usually highly expressed at 3 and 23 h p.i., which correspond to the periods of inflammation and wound repair, respectively 59 ( Figure ES4C ). The cytokine genes IL8 and IL32 responded in both MARV-and EBOV-infected HuH7 cells, showing a significant up-regulation (Fig. 4B) . IL32 expression can be induced by IL8 and is involved in the apoptosis of T cells in EBOV-infected patients 60, 61 . It is also up-regulated in response to influenza A virus infections. The up-regulation of IL8 results in the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways 62, 63 . We identified NRAV up-regulation 7 h p.i. This long non-coding RNA was recently reported as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity that acts via the suppression of interferon-stimulated gene transcription 64 . We propose that a cellular component exists, in addition to the filoviral inhibition of the innate immune system by VP24 and VP35 [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] , that results in the same inhibition of innate immunity. At 23 h p.i. we identified several highly up-and down-regulated genes, which we were unable to categorize (see Section ES4). We also determined that ANXA3 was markedly up-regulated. Annexin A3 is an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 and possesses anti-coagulant properties 70 . Our data indicate an initial inflammatory response (3 h p.i.) 50 , followed by a repression of antiviral defenses (7 h p.i.) with the majority of up-and down-regulated gene expression occurring at 23 h p.i. in the HuH7 cells (Fig. 6) .",

An up-regulated expression of DUSP1 has been observed for vaccinia virus-infected cells 88 and EBOV-infected human macrophages 14 .

Upon EBOV invasion of the host cells, an antiviral response is induced, including the activation of NF\u03baB and MAPK. Genes of other innate immune response pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT, DDX58) are then suppressed. After EBOV infection, DUSPs are highly up-regulated in HuH7 cells, correlating with the down-regulation of MAPK8, MAPK1/3 and MAPK14 mRNA levels. When translated, these genes are responsible for the innate immune response 89 . PPP1R15A plays a central role by binding to the receptor TGFBR1 and inhibiting additional components of the innate immune system. Compared with HuH7 cells, R06E-J cells demonstrate almost no or only a very slight up-regulation of PPP1R15A and DUSPs, very likely leading to a stable antiviral response. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of all JAK/STAT pathway genes in R06E-J cells remain constant during EBOV-infection compared with the levels in HuH7 cells. The viral protein VP24 inhibits STAT1 activity in humans, blocking signaling into the nucleus. We suggest that a possible feedback loop exists that increases the number of IFNGR2 receptors in HuH7 cells. The robust expression of interferon-stimulated genes could orchestrate the antiviral response of the infected cell 90 .",

TLR3 is expressed at a greater level in R06E-J cells than in the human cell line, but was also not differentially expressed. These results support our RNA-Seq data. Interestingly, we observed differences in the melting curves for TLR3 and HAVCR1 ( Figure ES7B ), which could be due to differences in the amplified sequences of human and bat RNA as identical degenerate primers were used for the amplification of TLR3 from HuH7 and R06E-J cells.

Growth arrest and DNA damage 34 (GADD34, officially known as PPP1R15A) can be rapidly induced by several types of cellular stress. In R06E-J cells, PPP1R15A was slightly up-regulated (2X) due to EBOV infection after 23 h; in HuH7 cells, we observed a strong up-regulation (45X) in EBOV-infected cells and no up-regulation in MARV-infected cells. (C) The DUSP pathway. DUSP1, 8 and 10 demonstrate the highest specificity for MAPKs (MAPK14 and MAPK8). DUSP1 is localized in the nucleus, whereas DUSP8 and DUSP10 are also available in the cytosol. The nuclear DUSPs are thought to be inducible phosphatases 87 , and the implications of DUSPs during viral infections have been demonstrated for DUSP1, which is up-regulated during Epstein-Barr virus 97 and vaccinia virus infections88 . In response to the vaccinia virus, DUSP1 is actively involved in antiviral countermeasures of the host cell via the regulation of MAPK phosphorylation. Legend.

Nearly all of the highly deregulated keyplayers of most significant pathways of this study (e.g. MAPK, NF\u03baB, JAK/STAT and DUSP) are part of this filovirus infection network. We are not able to connect all genes (e.g. SKP2 inhibiting CDKN1B, CYCE and CDKN1A). We found seven members of the DUSP pathway (DUSP1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 16) being highly deregulated and involved in many interactions, mostly repressing MAPK8, MAPK1/MAPK3 and MAPK14.
