At the time of the study, he was a current smoker. He was in the greenhouse building business with a business facility in the Middle East, specifically Bahrain, as well as at a domestic business facility in Asan, Chungnam, Korea. He visited the Middle East region about once every 2 months and stayed for approximately 3 weeks during each visit. The most recent business trip was between April 24, and May 4, 2015, for 11 days. He had business visits to Saudi Arabia (May 1 to 2) and the United Arab Emirates (April 29 to 30) with Bahrain as the base; both departure from and arrival at Korea was via Qatar. During his stay in the Middle East, he had no history of direct contact with camels, consuming camel by products such as milk or meat, or visiting the medical facilities there. In Saudi Arabia, he stayed at his business facility and the hotel in the area of Al Muzahimiyah outside of the capital, Riyadh. During his trips within the Middle East, he had no contact with animals and did not eat or drink outside the hotels where he stayed. While staying in Riyadh, he travelled with a driver, a guide, and the Bahrain business facility manager, none of whom showed the symptoms suspected of MERS. Patient #1 returned to Korea without any abnormal symptoms on May 4 via Flight OZ6888 and went to his domestic business place in Asan on May 11. On May 11, fever broke for the first time, and he visited Asan Seoul Clinic the next day (May 12). At the time of the visit, his body temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, and he complained of febrile sense and myalgia. On May 14, he visited the same place with a persistent high temperature (38.9\u00b0C) and myalgia, and on May 15, he was transferred to Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital for inpatient treatment, because respiratory symptoms such as cough and sputum had developed, his body temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, and the myalgia had worsened. After the transfer, he was in an outpatient exam room, a laboratory room, and a chest radiography room, and was put in a double-occupancy room at approximately 2 pm (Room 8104, 8th floor). Around 7:15 pm, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed on the first underground floor. On the following day (May 16) at approximately 7:15 am, he visited the radiography room on the first underground floor to undergo a chest radiogram. Pneumonia in the right upper lobe was found on the chest CT scan, and infections with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneu monia were confirmed on bacterial culture testing. From the evening of May 15, breathing difficulty and chest pain developed. Symptoms did not improve, and the patient was discharged from the hospital at 10 am on Sunday, May 17; thereafter, his wife drove him for treatment to the 365 Clinic, where he usually went for examination. The 365 Clinic referred him to a high-level medical center. He went to the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul emergency department, but returned home because a patient room was not available. On the following day (May 18) at approximately 10 am, his wife drove him again to the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul emergency department, and he was admitted. From 2 pm, he wore a facial mask. On May 19, he was reported to the KCDC as a case suspected of MERS in consideration of the clinical courses that deteriorated despite the antibiotic therapy and his history of travel to the Middle East within the previous two weeks, which was revealed during a consultation with physician. On May 20, his sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was determined positive, following which he was transferred to the National Medical Center. Patient #1 received antiviral, interferon, and antibiotic treatments, and me chanical ventilation therapy after an endo-tracheal intubation was performed due to worsening respiratory symptoms. On June 30, a sputum PCR test was confirmed negative for MERS virus, and it was decided that he was cured. On September 25, he was discharged after completing treatment for a sacral sore (Figure1).

Depending on the extent of contact, they were classified into either 1) quarantine of a person or a place or 2) active observational surveillance and were closely tracked and observed ( Figure 1 ). During surveillance, when symptoms suspected as MERS occurred, respiratory samples were collected for testing, the suspected cases were transferred to a quarantined hospital, and epidemiological investigations were conducted.",

However, trying to correlate Patient #1's transmission capacity or epidemiological characteristics to the infection rate had limitations because with the spread of MERS, the scope of surveillance of contacted individuals gradually expanded, and the standards were not consistent across different institutions. Nonetheless, based on a study analyzing epidemiological characteristics of the MERS outbreak around Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, the rate of infection was 3.9% overall and was 1.1% among medical staff members; 7.6% among patients; and 3.3% among guardians, caregivers, and visitors [4] . Aside from Patient #1, 3 of 28 individuals, in particular, with a confirmed diagnosis (#14, #15, and #16) individually infected more than 5 individuals whose diagnosis was additionally confirmed, and they were thus labeled as \"super spreaders.\" It is thought that, after contact with Patient #1, they visited different medical facilities and became epidemiologically associated with additional patients with a confirmed diagnosis [5] .",

Thereafter, a \"MERS crisis\" transpired for the first time wherein a total of 186 patients were confirmed with MERS infection; 36 deaths occurred among these patients, and 16,693 individuals were quarantined for prevention. The clinical symptoms in the first patient deteriorated because of a delay in receiving appropriate treatment, and he was assisted with mechanical ventilation.

            "text": "From the epidemiological investigation, the course of transmission to this patient in the Middle East was not clear. It can only be inferred that the first patient became infected while visiting Saudi Arabia, on the basis of a recent study showing that the MERS virus that broke out in Korea is genetically closest to the Qatar strain [5, 6] . However, to uncover the specific course of transmission, we must perform an epidemiological investigation in coordination with Saudi Arabia. Various factors are considered as causes of the widespread outbreak. The first is health care workers' lack of knowledge regarding MERS. Since June 2013, the KCDC had organized a national MERS management team in preparation of a MERS outbreak in Korea, and mockup training had been performed to enhance the capacity to manage outbreaks of novel infectious diseases at quarantine stations and at the level of local government of cities and provinces. However, in cases such as the present case, wherein the symptoms do not manifest themselves when patients enter Korea, preventing an outbreak of a novel infectious disease by imposing quarantine is not practical. In particular, health care workers did not receive sufficient education or communication against MERS in anticipation of a case wherein a MERS-infected individual, on whom quarantine was not imposed, would go to a regional medical facility. Until the diagnosis was confirmed for Patient #1, the first 3 medical facilities that he visited were unable to suspect a MERS case. The doctor at the 3rd medical facility, who examined Patient #1 and subsequently became infected, in an interview with the media after his discharge stated that he had not even heard of MERS. The second factor communication about MERS among travelers to the Middle East was insufficient. Since 2013, when the likelihood of spread of MERS would spread within the Middle East region was indicated, the KCDC persistently promoted MERS awareness among the travelers to that region. However, Patient #1, who frequently visited the region and his family members, had no idea about MERS. Thus, when he visited the general medical facilities with respiratory symptoms, he did not mention about his travel to the Middle East, and only mentioned about his visit to Bahrain when inquired about a travel history involving the Middle East at the medical center where his diagnosis was confirmed. Therefore, MERS could not be diagnosed sooner. A third factor contributing to the rationale behind the outbreak was not kept in check earlier was that quarantine was not thoroughly imposed. After Patient #1's diagnosis was confirmed, thorough quarantine was neither imposed on individuals who had close contact with him nor on those with casual contact (such as those who had a possibly contacted the doctors or the patients or those who were exposed to a space infected by him). Lastly, in this outbreak, most patients were infected via hospital-acquired infection because Korean medical institutions' patient rooms and emergency rooms were very crowded, and infected patients had to visit several hospitals because of the shortcomings of the medical care delivery system, which played a critical role in the spread of MERS from hospital to hospital.",

The MERS outbreak should serve as an opportunity to improve the level of managing hospital-acquired infection in Korea.",
