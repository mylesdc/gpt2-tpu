            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can be treated with direct acting antivirals like acyclovir and foscarnet, but long-term use can lead to drug resistance, which motivates research into broadly-acting antivirals that can provide a greater genetic barrier to resistance. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) employs a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen to create a local burst of reactive oxygen species that inactivate microorganisms. The botanical plant extract Orthoquin TM is a powerful photosensitizer with antimicrobial properties. Here we report that Orthoquin also has antiviral properties. Photoactivated Orthoquin inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner across a broad range of sub-cytotoxic concentrations. HSV inactivation required direct contact between Orthoquin and the inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target cells had no effect. Orthoquin did not cause appreciable damage to viral capsids or premature release of viral genomes, as measured by qPCR for the HSV-1 genome. By contrast, immunoblotting for HSV-1 antigens in purified virion preparations suggested that higher doses of Orthoquin had a physical impact on certain HSV-1 proteins that altered protein mobility or antigen detection. Orthoquin PDI also inhibited the non-enveloped adenovirus (AdV) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Orthoquin-mediated inhibition of the enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was light-independent. Together, these findings suggest that the broad antiviral effects of Orthoquin-mediated PDI may stem from damage to viral attachment proteins. facilitate attachment and entry into host cells. While HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar, they share onl\u1ef9 55% nucleotide identity.",

Fusion of viral and host membranes enables delivery of the viral nucleocapsid and tegument proteins to the cytoplasm. After the HSV nucleocapsid arrives at the nucleus and delivers the viral genome, HSV genes are expressed in an ordered temporal cascade. Viral egress requires primary envelopment of the genome-containing capsid at the inner nuclear membrane, fusion with the outer nuclear membrane and final envelopment at the trans-Golgi network. Mature virions then exit through the cellular secretory system.",

            "text": "All stages of the HSV replication cycle offer potential targets for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, DAAs can be undermined by the emergence of drug resistant mutant viruses. Anti-HSV DAAs acyclovir and foscarnet offer examples of the hazards of drug resistance. These drugs interrupt HSV genome replication by different mechanisms of action. Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that selectively targets HSV infected cells through the action of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme, which efficiently phosphorylates acyclovir and facilitates incorporation into nascent viral DNA genomes by the HSV DNA polymerase enzyme; incorporation of acyclovir into viral DNA terminates genome replication [3] . By contrast, the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet blocks viral genome replication by directly inhibiting HSV DNA polymerase activity [4] . Though resistance to acyclovir occurs at a low prevalence (\u22641%) in immunocompetent patients [5], immunocompromised patients experience much higher rates (4-10%) [6] . Unsurprisingly, resistance to acyclovir, and its derivatives, and to foscarnet, has been mapped to mutations in the viral thymidine kinase and the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit, respectively [7] . Currently, Abreva (n-docosanol) is the only over-the-counter topical antiviral for herpes labialis. Abreva is incorporated into the cellular plasma membrane and prevents fusion steps essential for HSV-1 entry into epithelial cells [8] . However, it must be applied repeatedly throughout the day due to rapid plasma membrane turnover and the subsequent loss of n-docosanol [9] . This host-targeted antiviral mechanism prevents development of viral resistance, but Abreva is only approved for perioral lesions, so there is a still a gap in treatment for lesions in other areas of the body.",

            "text": "Like Abreva, there is potential for more broadly-acting antiviral drugs that exploit the physical structure of the HSV virion and block early stages of infection, such as attachment and penetration. In this study, we explored the potential of the plant-derived photosensitizing agent Orthoquin TM to mediate photodynamic inactivation (PDI) [10] of virions. The clinical utility of Orthoquin PDI of oral biofilms is an area of active investigation and there is clear potential for wider range of clinical applications. The basis of PDI is the photodynamic effect, which has been exploited in photodynamic therapy (PDT) [11, 12] for treatment of cancers [13] and age-related macular degeneration [14] . In PDT, photosensitizer compounds when exposed to visible light react with oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include singlet oxygen [15] . ROS damage proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which can lead to cell death. Some of the most well-known photosensitizing molecules for PDT are based on a tetrapyrrolic core and are found in naturally occurring pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, and bacteriochlorophyll [16] . The accepted phototoxic mechanism for these types of photosensitizers involves the formation of an excited triplet state upon light absorption that can participate in electron (Type 1) or energy (Type 2) transfer processes. Type 1 electron transfer reactions typically lead to the formation of radical species like superoxide or hydroxyl radicals, whereas Type 2 energy transfer produces cytotoxic singlet oxygen. It is possible for a photosensitizer to initiate both Type 1 and 2 photoprocesses simultaneously, depending on the specific chemistry of the photosensitizing agent and its environment [16] . Due to the high reactivities and short lifetimes of oxidizing molecules, it is expected that only viral structures in close proximity to activated photosensitizing compounds will be affected.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex viruses are ubiquitous and cause life-long infections of their human hosts. HSV infections are primarily acquired at mucosal surfaces where initial epithelial cell infections can lead to disease manifestations that include herpes labialis, genital herpes, gingivostomatitis, herpetic whitlow, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, neonatal herpes, and stromal keratitis [1] . HSV-1 and HSV-2 share common structural features, including a large double-stranded DNA genome protected by a nucleocapsid, a tegument layer containing viral proteins that are delivered to the host cell early in infection, and an envelope derived from host membranes studded with viral glycoproteins that Orthoquin has been shown to have bacteriocidal properties and to disrupt bacterial biofilms without causing overt inflammation [17] . In this study we investigated Orthoquin's anti-herpesviral properties and mechanism of action. We showed that sub-cytotoxic doses of Orthoquin reduced HSV-1 and HSV-2 plaque formation in a light-dependent manner, whereas high doses displayed light-independent antiviral effects. Surprisingly, HSV-2 displayed high intrinsic photosensitivity, so we focused primarily on the relatively photo-resistant HSV-1. PDI of HSV-1 required close proximity between Orthoquin and the viral inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target host cells with Orthoquin exposed to light had no effect. High doses of Orthoquin disrupted immunodetection of a subset of HSV-1 structural proteins by a pan-anti-HSV-1 polyclonal antibody, suggesting that PDI may cause physical damage to proteins on the virion exterior that prevents infection. Finally, we demonstrated light-dependent Orthoquin PDI of adenovirus infection and light-independent inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection.",

The ethanolic solution containing the extract was concentrated in vacuo to give the bioactive product, which was further enriched by a proprietary fractionation process. The final product was characterized by HPLC ( Figure 1 ) based on UV-Vis absorption signals at five different wavelengths (254 nm, 306 nm, 320 nm, 435 nm, and 450 nm). The largest identifiable signals based on reference standards were due to polydatin (63 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ), resveratrol (60 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ), anthraglycoside B (12 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ), rhein (5.6 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ), emodin (50 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ), and physcion (10 \u00b5g mg \u22121 ).

Together, these findings indicate that Orthoquin posesses light-dependent anti-HSV properties, as well as light-independent properties that operate at higher concentrations. It is likely that the longer light exposure time used for HSV-1 is enhancing Orthoquin's antiviral effects at the 0.05 \u00b5g/mL dose (relative to the same concentration for HSV-2), but we did not test HSV-2 with Orthoquin for longer than 5 min due to inherent light sensitivity.

Immunoblotting crude HSV-1-infected HeLa cell lysates confirmed detection of diverse HSV-1 antigens, some of which were also clearly evident in the viral particle samples, indicating that they represent structural proteins (Figure 8 ). The pattern of detectable protein species from viral particle samples was unchanged by treatment with 0.1 \u00b5g/mL Orthoquin. By contrast, treatment with the higher 0.1 mg/mL dose of Orthoquin caused a dramatic loss of detection of certain antigens in the 80-135 kDa range, in a light-dependent manner. We do not know whether this loss of antigen detection is due to Orthoquin PDI-mediated degradation of select HSV-1 proteins, or physical disruption of discrete antigenic sites, or other mechanisms, and this 0.1 mg/mL dose far exceeds the effective dose previously established in Figure 3 . Nevertheless, these findings suggest that Orthoquin PDI can physically disrupt HSV-1 structural proteins. Modest physical disruption of HSV-1 structural proteins (i.e., envelope glycoproteins) by treatment with 0.1 \u00b5g/mL Orthoquin may be sufficient to inhibit infectivity without causing gross changes in structural proteins that would be detectable in an immunoblotting experiment. previously established in Figure 3 .

We showed that anti-HSV-1 PDI required co-administration of Orthoquin and light to viral inoculum, whereas pre-exposure of target cell monolayers to Orthoquin and light had no effect at the doses used in this study. This is consistent with known properties of photosensitizing agents that generate short-lived ROS and singlet oxygen that can damage nearby macromolecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids [24] and indicates that PDI requires close proximity to its target for its antiviral effect.",

            "text": "Improved understanding of the properties of Orthoquin will inform future investigations of the mechanism of virion damage. Orthoquin contains two compounds with previously reported antiviral activity, resveratrol and emodin. Resveratrol inhibits multiple enveloped and non-enveloped viruses by modulating signal transduction pathways (reviewed in [25, 26] ) and emodin was observed to inhibit HSV-1 [27] , human cytomegalovirus [28] , hepatitis B virus [29] , influenza A virus (IAV) [30] , and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication [31] . Emodin has also been shown to suppress efficient reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus from latency [32] , poliovirus-induced cytopathic effect [33] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein attachment [34] and HSV-1 alkaline exonuclease activity [35] . One known function of emodin is to act as a competitive inhibitor of casein kinase II [36] , a cellular kinase that plays key supportive roles in many viral infections [37] [38] [39] [40] . Additionally, as a highly hydrophobic anthraquinone, emodin invades phospholipid bilayers and promotes non-lamellar phase transitions [41] . Our data demonstrate that Orthoquin displays maximal inhibitory activity when in close proximity with enveloped virions prior to infection, which raises the possibility of emodin-induced phase changes in the viral envelope concomitant with PDI.",

This antibody detects major HSV-1 glycoprotein antigens, suggesting that Orthoquin PDI-generated ROS may physically disrupt antigens to prevent detection, alter protein mobility in SDS-PAGE, and/or accelerate protein degradation. Indeed, another anthraquinone derivative related to emodin, hypericin, was shown to induce protein cross-linking in vitro through singlet oxygen production following photactivation [42] . While our data does not demonstrate the presence of cross-linked viral proteins in Orthoquin-treated HSV-1 virions, it would nevertheless be of interest to investigate any changes to virion proteins at the molecular level. Our study also suggests that Orthoquin PDI leaves the underlying HSV-1 nucleocapsids intact, as viral dsDNA genome content was unchanged in treated inoculum compared to untreated controls. In an attempt to identify specific glycoproteins disrupted by Orthoquin PDI, we performed additional immunoblotting experiments with antibodies raised against HSV-1 glycoprotein C; however, these experiments were inconclusive because these antibodies were not sensitive enough to detect glycoprotein C in our purified virion preparations.",

VSV was susceptible to Orthoquin in a light-independent manner, suggesting a potentially distinct mechanism of action. By contrast, AdV was susceptible to Orthoquin in a light-and dose-dependent manner, and only slightly less sensitive than HSV-1 and HSV-2. Previous research showed that emodin inactivated enveloped viruses (herpesviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, and IAV) but had no effect on non-enveloped viruses AdV serotype 37 and rhinovirus serotype 1A [43, 44] . However, in the study by Lin, et al. emodin inhibited enterovirus replication by stimulating interferon production [44] . Similarly, resveratrol has been shown to inhibit IAV replication by stimulating interferon production [30] . Because AdV lacks a lipid envelope and was maximally inhibited in the presence of light, we speculate that Orthoquin interferes with the function of surface-exposed viral proteins; however, we cannot exclude a potential role for interferon in Orthoquin antiviral activity at this time.",
