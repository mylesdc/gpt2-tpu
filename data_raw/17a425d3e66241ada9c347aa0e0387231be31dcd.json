Clinically, YPFS has been widely used to regulate immune functions; however, the action mechanism of it is not known. Here, we addressed this issue by providing detail analyses of chemical and biological properties of YPFS. By using rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, fifteen chemicals deriving from different herbs of YPFS were determined, and which served as a control for the standardization of the herbal extract of YPFS. In general, the amounts of chosen chemical markers were higher in a preparation of YPFS as compared to that of single herb or two-herb compositions. In order to reveal the immune functions of YPFS, the standardized extract was applied onto cultured murine macrophages. The treatment of YPFS stimulated the mRNA and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-kB by enhancing IkBa degradation. In contrast, the application of YPFS suppressed the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic inflammation model. In addition, YPFS could up regulate the phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. These results therefore supported the bi-directional immunemodulatory roles of YPFS in regulating the releases of cytokines from macrophages.",

            "text": "Compatibility in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a very specialized methodology having a combination of different herbs as to form a formulated herbal decoction (named as Fu Fang) [1] , [2] . Unfortunately, the complexity of chemical composition avoids the delineation of molecular mechanisms of a herbal decoction. Yu Ping Feng San (YPFS) composes of Astragali Radix (AR; Huangqi; the root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge or Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var. mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR; Baizhu; the rhizomes of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.) and Saposhnikoviae Radix (SR; Fangfeng; the roots of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk.) in a weight ratio of 1:2:1. YPFS was described in Dan Xi Xin Fa by Zhu Danxi in Yuan Dynasty (A.D. 1279-1368) of China. Literally, the name YPFS means Jade Screen, i.e. forming a solid screen to protect our body. AR, called ''the senior of all herbs'' in the Essentials of the Materia Medica (A.D. 1694), is considered the best immune tonic herb in stabilizing and strengthening the protective ''Qi'' [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . AMR is bitter, sweet and warm in nature, and which is beneficial for anti-inflammation, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-ulcer, anti-obesity, anti-cancer and so on [8] [9] [10] [11] . SR is used to expel ''wind'', to relieve exterior syndrome, to eliminate dampness, to relieve convulsion and diarrhea [12] [13] [14] . Having these herbs, YPFS is being used to replenish ''Qi'' and to consolidate the superficies and arrest perspiration, i.e. clinical symptoms having spontaneous sweating, frequent colds, aversion to wind, fatigue and a pale and shiny complexion. Clinically, YPFS has been applied in anti-viral or anti-bacterial effects, which indeed has been shown to prevent viral infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and enhance cellular immunity [15] [16] [17] [18] . In addition, panaxynol was revealed in YPFS as an active ingredient by using splenocyte binding-HPLC analysis [19] . However, the chemical composition and biological efficacy of YPFS are still rather limited.",

Clinically, YPFS was indicated to prevent colds and to treat upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, the biological effects of YPFS were firstly illustrated by inflammatory response and phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor that governs the expressions of a wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines [20] . Interleukin 1b (IL-1b), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) are the key pro-inflammatory cytokines playing critical roles in the process of inflammation. Activation of NF-kB could prevent the attacks from the invaders via initiation of many downstream immune response genes, e.g. IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa, whereas a loss of control leads to pathological conditions, such as severe inflammation, autoimmune disease, and inflammation-associated oncogenesis [21] . In parallel, phagocytosis by macrophages is critical for the uptake and degradation of infectious agents and senescent cells [22] .",

In order to standardize YPFS chemically, a typical HPLC (13) , ononin (4), calycosin (1), astragaloside III (6), astragaloside IV (7), astragaloside II (5), formononetin (3), aesculetin (IS1), Rg1 (IS2) and chrysin (IS3) was made by a MS detector in the negative mode.

Representative chromatograms are shown, n = 3. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0078622.g002 fingerprint of YPFS at absorbance of 210 nm was developed ( Figure 1 ): the fingerprint was used to ensure the detection of the chosen chemical markers from the herbal extracts. More important this fingerprint served as an index for identification of YPFS. As a first step to standardize the extract of YPFS, we developed a rapid LC-MS method to simultaneously identify different chemicals from the three herbs, as a means of quality assessment. In this case, the quantity of these chemicals might be used not only for quality control of YPFS, but also for the elucidation of the compatible principle. Fifteen chemical markers were selected based on their abundant amounts in the herbs and their immune-modulatory effects, as reported in the literatures. These chemicals included: (i) AR-derived flavonoids: calycosin-7-O-b-D-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin; (ii) ARderived saponins: astragaloside IV, III and II; (iii) AMR-derived sesquiterpenoids: atractylenolide I, II and III; (iv) SR-derived chromones prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 5-O-methylvisammioside; and (v) SR-derived coumarins: scopoletin, isopsoralen and psoralen [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

The fragmentor voltage and collision energy values were optimized to obtain the highest value of the chemicals including the internal standards (Table S1 and  Table S2 ). To validate the analytic method, the linearity, sensitivity, precision, repeatability and accuracy of the analytes were determined. For the linearity, the calibration curve of each chemical was constructed using a range of concentrations of working standards, and each line was based on six different concentrations ( Table S3 ). The LOD and LOQ were used to evaluate the sensitivity. The LOD was estimated with a signal 3 times higher than that of the baseline noise while the LOQ was 10 times higher. The assay precision was determined by intra-day and inter-day variations, which were performed by analyzing standard solutions during a single day (n = 6) and on 3 executive days (n = 6), respectively. For repeatability test, five independent samples were prepared. The accuracy was evaluated as the percentage recovery of analytes in the spiked samples. The recoveries were calculated by the following formula: Recovery (%) = 1006 (amount found-original amount)/amount spiked. RSD was used to describe precision, repeatability and recovery (Table S4) . These results were verified in determining the amount of fifteen chemicals with YPFS.",

In order to reveal the herb-to-herb interaction in chemical solubilities, the amounts of chemicals, extracted in the form of single herb, two herbs together and three herbs together (i.e. YPFS extract), were measured. Different compositions of the herbs, based on the herb ratio in YPFS, were boiled together under standardized protocol as to test the variation of chemical solubility. The solubilities of AR-derived flavonoids, including calycosin-7-Ob-D-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin, were much better in YPFS (Fig. 3A) . The increase solublities could also be revealed when AR was boiled together with either AMR or SR. The AR-derived saponins, including astragaloside II, III and IV, showed similar increase in YPFS when AR was boiling with AMR and SR together (Fig. 3B) . Again, the increase solublities were revealed in boiling together with AMR or SR. The AMR-derived sesquiterpenoids, including atractylenolide I, II and III, showed robust increase (at least by 30% increase) in boiling as YPFS (Fig. 3C) . The SR-derived chromones, including prim-Oglucosylcimifugin and 5-O-methylvisammioside were increased in a preparation of YPFS (Fig. 3D ). In contrast, the amount of SR-derived coumarins, including scopoletin, isopsoralen and psoralen were slightly decreased when SR was boiled as in YPFS (Fig. 3E) . The decrease was similar in a case of boiling together with AR or AMR. Thus, the amounts of those chosen chemical markers were higher, in general, in a preparation of YPFS as compared to that of a single herb, which suggested that the herbal mixture indeed could provide better chemical composition. In addition, the chemical analysis could serve a parameter for chemical standardization and repeatability of the decoction preparation. These values served the minimal amount of chemicals for a standardized YPFS being prepared for each time, and which could be used as a quality index for the biological studies.",

The results indicated that all the tested herbal extracts exhibited low toxicity to macrophages, and the maximum dose could be at 3 mg/mL in the following experiments (Fig. S2) . In order to reveal the immune-modulatory functions of YPFS at molecular level, NF-kB pathway and its downstream genes (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) were our targets of investigation. Cultured macrophages were treated with different YPFS, or AR, or AMR, or SR herbal extracts for 24 hours, and then the transcript and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined. Under the treatment of YPFS in cultured macrophages, the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa were stimulated by YPFS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . The maximal induction was achieved at about 2 to 20 folds under the treatment of 1-3 mg/mL of YPFS in all cases (Fig. 4A) . The best induction was under the treatment of SR extract: this extract stimulated the mRNA expressions of cytokines by 8-to 10,000-fold and protein expressions by 20-to 4,000-fold (Fig. 4B) . A robust induction was observed in the expression of IL-6 under the effect of SR extract (Fig. 4B) .

To clarify the activation effects of YPFS on expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a specific NF-kB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 was utilized for this purpose. Pre-treatment with 5 mM BAY 11-7082 to cultured macrophages for 3 hours, the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulated by YPFS, could be significantly suppressed about 2-to 2,000-fold (Fig. 5A) . To identify the potential NF-kB activators from YPFS, a luciferase-reporter construct having the repeats of NF-kB responsive elements (i.e. pNF-kB-Luc) was employed here. In pNF-kB-Luc transfected cells, the herbal extracts were applied. The promoter-driven luciferase activity was induced by application of YPFS in the transfected macrophages: the induction was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B) . The maximal induction could be at over 15-fold. In addition, the activation effects of the extracts of AR, AMR and SR were also determined here. Both AR and SR extracts showed a robust activation of pNF-kB-Luc activity, and the SR-induced activation was at ,25-fold (Fig. 5B) . The control LPS treatment showed an indication of ,40-fold. For the mechanistic aspect, the effect of YPFS on the degradation of NF-kB inhibitory protein IkBa was determined in the present or absent of BAY 11-7082. After 30 min incubation with LPS, about 90% of IkBa was degraded as compared with the original IkBa. Pre-treatment with 5 mM BAY 11-7082 for 3 hours, LPS could only induce 60% degradation of IkBa. More importantly, 3 mg/ mL of YPFS could induce the degradation of IkBa in a timedependent manner (0, 10, 20 and 30 min). By application of Bay 11-7082 for 3 hours, the effects of YPFS in degrading IkBa could be partially blocked (Fig C) . All of the results consistently support the idea that YPFS induces the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-kB through enhancing degradation of IkBa.",

This treatment was a well-known model for studying anti-inflammation [31] . Here, YPFS and other herbal extracts were applied onto cultured macrophages in testing the inhibition effects on the LPSinduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In LPSinduced cytokine expressions, YPFS suppressed the transcript and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 7A) . YPFS suppressed IL-1b protein expression by ,20%, IL-6 protein expression by ,40%, and TNFa protein expression by ,25% in the LPS-induced chronic inflammation model (Fig. 7A) . The extracts from single herb showed the suppression effects as that of YPFS (Fig. 7B) . The suppression effects of AMR extract were stronger than YPFS in LPS-induced cytokine protein expression. Here, dexamethasone (Dex) served as a positive control, which is a potent synthetic member of the glucocorticoid class of steroid drugs that has antiinflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. Ten mM Dex could significantly suppress the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines up to 20%,90% in all cases (Fig. 7B ).",

            "text": "The rational for having specific combination of different herbs in forming a TCM herbal formula is a major stumbling block in the internationalization of Chinese medicine, which hinders the discovery of action mechanisms in using TCM as a therapeutic agent of treating diseases. Here, we disclosed the underlying reasons for the compatibility of different herbs within YPFS by using the analysis of chemical constituents in the extracts. Chemically, YPFS of having 3 different herbs together during the preparation promoted strongly the solubilities of different chemcials, and which was better than single herb or two-herb compositions, i.e. better solubilities of active ingradients in YPFS. Having different herbs together in making a herbal decoction might greatly enhance the pharmaceutical effects by getting more extrable active ingredients in the final decoction. This phenomena of herb compatibility has been revealed similarily in another herbal formula-Danggui Buxue Tang. Having two herbs, Astragali Radix and Angelicae Sinensis Radix, boiling together as Danggui Buxue Tang indeed could enhance the solubilities of the active ingredients [29] . In addition, the decoction showed a robust biological effects in various systems [23] , [28] [29] [30] , [32] : these effects were better than the decoction having only single herb. It is worth mentioning that the identification of chemical composition in a herbal decoction would be a pre-requistic step in revealing the possible therapeutic effects. In parallel, the established chemical criteria could serve as parameters for a well-prepared YPFS.",

Traditionally, the main function of YPFS is enhancing ''Qi'' that includes ''Defensive Qi'' referring to the immune function and ''Nutritive Qi'' referring to nourish blood function. Both of these ''Qi'' functions could be illustrated here by YPFS. Although we have not illustarted the blood function of YPFS here, this function could be predicted by having AR as well as the bioactive flavonoids. The principal herb of YPFS is AR that contains 0.75,1.81% by weight of flavonoids including calycosin and formononetin [33] . These two flavonoids are known to induce the gene expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis of red blood cell production in a dose-dependent manner in cultured fibroblasts [34] , as well as in animals (unpublished data). Here, the amount of flavonoids in YPFS was highly enriched to about 4 mg/g of dried YPFS extract: this conentration of flavonoids is expected to perform the blood stimulating function in our body. In parallel, the absorption of flavonoids could be enhanced in cutlured Caco-2 epidermal cells under the influence of AMR extract (unpublished data). These biological activities are all considered as the function of nutritive ''Qi''. In defensive ''Qi'', the immuno-modulation of YPFS could be in two directions: stimulating and supressing cytokine releases, as shown in this study here.",

The robust immuno-effect of SR extract in either direction could not be beneficency to our body. The functional balance could be a unique character of herbal formula as compared to that of single herbal extract. In order to function effectively, the immune system has to strike a balance between the activities of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines [35] . Here, we have demonstarted that YPFS possessed both pro-and anti-inflammatory effects in cultured macrophages. The YPFS-induced expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines are IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa. In contrast, the YPFS-suppressed expressions of LPS-induced cytokines are IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa. The herbal decoction exerted bi-directional modulating functions are commonly described previously [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] ; however, this property could be hardly found in the western medicine. In YPFS, the glycoprotein derived from AMR was shown to stimulate markedly the production of TNFa in splenocyte, and in contrast AMR-derived atractylenolide I and atractylenolide III were shown to exert anti-inflammation effects via suppressing the expression of LPS-induced TNFa in cultured macrophages [24] , [38] . Although the bi-directional modulating functions of YPFS were demonstrated here, the underlying mechanism was still unknown. ",

Cultured macrophages were seeded on to 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours. After that, the cells were treated with herbal extracts in different concentrations (0.03 mg/ mL-3 mg/mL) for 24 hours. The MTT solution was added to the cell cultures and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a microplate reader.

Then, LPS (1 mg/mL for gene expression, 0.5 mg/mL for protein expression) was applied onto the cultures for 24 hours to mimic the chronic inflammation. The levels of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa were revealed by real time PCR, while GAPDH was served as an internal control for normalization. The protein expressions of proinflammatory cytokines were revealed by multiplexed bead-based immunoassay. Here, 10 mM Dex served as a positive control. Values were normalized to total protein content of each cultured well. Values are expressed as % of the LPS-induced activation, and in Mean 6 SD, where n = 3, each with triplicate samples. *p,0.05; ***p,0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0078622.g007",
