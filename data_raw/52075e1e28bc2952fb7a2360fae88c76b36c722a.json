Partial but incomplete resolution of clinical signs and thoracic radiographic/computed tomographic imaging lesions were noted with use of susceptibility-guided antimicrobials. Additionally, a concern for an infectious nidus led to left cranial lung lobectomy at 9 months of age. Histopathology predominantly revealed polypoid and constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e., small airway disease). Intermittent antimicrobial administration over the next 5 years failed to blunt progressive clinical signs. At 8 years, necropsy confirmed severe airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. This pattern of fibrosis was strongly suggestive of underlying small airway disease as the trigger. In retrospect, post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), a syndrome in young children caused by pulmonary infections but not yet recognized in pet dogs, likely initiated a pathway of fibrosis in this dog. In dogs with risk factors for community-acquired pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, PIBO is a differential diagnosis with development of severe, persistent respiratory signs incompletely responsive to appropriate antimicrobials. Untreated PIBO may lead to airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. Future study is required to determine if targeted therapy of PIBO could alter the course of end-stage pulmonary fibrosis.",

Treatment is generally supportive therapy and frequently includes glucocorticoids (4) (5) (6) . In dogs, while many contagious respiratory pathogens cause tracheobronchitis and pneumonia, bronchiolar diseases including PIBO are not well recognized as spontaneous clinical syndromes. Importantly, severe damage to the lung can lead to end-stage and untreatable fibrosis, with most cases in dogs not having a recognizable trigger and thus being termed \"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\" This report describes a puppy developing PIBO after Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia with histologic evidence of small airway changes strongly supporting development of pulmonary fibrosis. Recognizing addressable triggers of fibrotic lung disease could have important implications for delaying progression of end-stage lung lesions.",

Previously the primary care veterinarian treated it for cough with successive 2-week courses of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and enrofloxacin with no improvement. It had been purchased 2 months prior from a pet store and was not current on vaccines or parasiticides and canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) was a top differential. Upon presentation, the owner reported the puppy had increased respiratory effort, tachypnea, weakness, and hacking cough for 2 days. Physical examination findings included heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min, and pyrexia 103.8 \u2022 F (39.9 \u2022 C). Cardiothoracic auscultation revealed crackles in all lung fields, with absence of murmur or arrhythmia. A blind bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed numerous intra-and extracellular bacteria consistent with septic suppurative pneumonia with light growth of Bordetella bronchiseptica on enrichment broth. The reason for the pure growth of Bordetella bronchiseptica only on enrichment broth could not be determined by the historic medical record; possible explanations could have been a recent unrecorded dose of an antimicrobial or improper sample handling prior to submission. A respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay on an endotracheal tube swab was negative for Bordetella bronchiseptica, Influenza A virus, adenovirus-2, distemper, herpesvirus, parainfluenza, respiratory coronavirus, and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In light of these results and sensitivity testing, the dog was treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (12.5 mg/kg PO q12 h); additionally, fenbendazole (23.4 mg/kg PO q24 h) for 5 days was administered.",

Histopathology of the left cranial lung lobe demonstrated small airway disease consisting of intraluminal plugging of bronchioles with downstream honeycombing, air trapping and subpleural fibrosis ( Figure 3A) ; the upstream bronchiolar lesions strongly supported small airways disease as the cause of the fibrosis. Larger airways (bronchi) were similarly narrowed with epithelial and goblet cell hyperplasia, intraluminal mucus and mucosal and submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration. Special stains failed to identify bacteria/microbes. Interestingly, culture of lung tissue showed heavy growth of Bordetella bronchiseptica. The absence of histologic evidence of infectious bronchopneumonia or positively staining bacterial organisms would strongly argue against Bordetella as a pathogen at the time of biopsy. However, as small airway disease was not recognized as a clinical syndrome in dogs at that time, the positive culture of Bordetella bronchiseptica was treated with marbofloxacin (5.2 mg/kg PO q24 h) for 28 days in accordance with antimicrobial susceptibility.",

The right lung is hyperinflated with the right cranial (RCr) and accessory (RAcc) lobes extending to the left of midline. Mosaic pattern characterized by a well circumscribed hypoattenuating area is seen in the accessory lobe (arrowhead). The parenchyma is otherwise relatively normal. By 8 years of age and after undergoing left cranial lobectomy as a puppy, the entire hyperinflated right lung has developed severe patchy parenchymal lesions consisting of ground-glass opacification (black arrows) and consolidation (*). This latter is most severe surrounding medium-to large-caliber dilated airways. Traction bronchiectasis (black arrowheads) in areas of architectural distortion is seen at the periphery of several of these airways, a common feature seen with pulmonary fibrosis. The mosaic pattern previously recognized in the accessory lobe (white arrowheads) is accentuated. Several cystic air-filled structures (white arrows) of varying size occupy the left caudal lobe.",

Post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans, a syndrome in children that can be caused by adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and less commonly Bordetella pertussis, is treated after resolution of infection with supportive therapies and corticosteroids to target inflammation (1-3). As PIBO is not a recognized syndrome in dogs, this dog failed to receive corticosteroid therapy, likely culminating in end-stage pulmonary fibrosis inclusive and distal to affected airways. Airway-centered interstitial fibrosis in people is one of three distinct patterns of lung fibrosis and emphasizes the site of initial injury is the small airways (8) . Histologic examination as a puppy and as an 8-year-old dog showed similar lesions of bronchiolitis obliterans and downstream fibrosis, with progressive, severe and more widespread lesions (especially fibrosis) from the latter time point. With awareness of PIBO in dogs, an early trigger of pulmonary fibrosis could have potential for targeted therapy. Direct treatment of a trigger causing eventual fibrosis represents a paradigm shift from the current strategy of attempting to treat fibrosis when it is end stage.",

Bordetella bronchiseptica is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in puppies (11) .

Therefore, it is possible the dog in this report was infected with \u22651 respiratory pathogen including adenovirus type 2 and/or Mycoplasma spp. While adenovirus type 2 was included in the initial respiratory PCR panel it is possible it was not identified because the sample was obtained from the endotracheal tube and not from BALF or sampling was performed after the peak shedding (7-10 days) after the initial infection (18) .

The former has not been characterized in pet dogs as it has been in humans and cats (19, 20) while the latter is fairly common. In humans, bronchiolar diseases can be classified as primary or secondary: in the former, pathology is anatomically limited to small airways and in the latter, disease extends either from large airways or from lung interstitium to small airways (19) . Although a similar classification scheme has been adapted to cats, distinction between primary bronchiolar disease leading to pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease culminating in fibrosis with secondary involvement of small airways may be difficult to distinguish (20) .

When cough and wheeze fail to resolve after acute respiratory infection, PIBO is a strong consideration (30) . Supportive criteria for PIBO in lieu of lung biopsy includes history of infectious pneumonia within the first 3 years of life in otherwise healthy children; physical exam or lung function tests supporting airway obstruction; thoracic radiographic and especially thoracic CT compatible features, and exclusion of other chronic lung diseases (4, 33, 34) . The dog in our report had severe Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia as a puppy, with persistent clinical signs despite appropriate antimicrobials. Histopathology confirmed BO, at the time an unrecognized clinical condition, approximately 2 months after initial diagnosis of bronchopneumonia. Honeycombing and subpleural fibrosis downstream of small airway lesions were present at the time of the initial biopsy and suggest a cause and effect relationship.",

Thoracic radiography in children with PIBO classically demonstrate hyperinflation/hyperlucency, atelectasis, patchy consolidation, airway wall thickening and bronchiectasis (4, 6) . As a puppy, radiographic changes reflected some changes reported in children. Thoracic CT is more sensitive than radiography and airflow limitation can be captured with paired inspiratory/expiratory scans (36, 37) . Common CT findings in children with PIBO include a mosaic pattern, bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, atelectasis and/or consolidation (4, 36, 38) . The classic finding diagnostic for air trapping is accentuation of mosaic attenuation on expiratory series which can be missed on inspiratory series alone (36, 37) . The initial CT performed as a puppy occurred prior to a protocol for ventilator-acquired inspiratory and expiratory breath-holds at our facility and thus less well reflected air trapping. Prior to euthanasia, CT lesions were dominated by fibrosis although patchy regions of air trapping were noted. Histopathology of lung tissue approximately 7 years after initial lung biopsy showed marked multifocal chronic constrictive and obliterative BO with multifocal interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect CIRDC endured early in life contributed to chronic BO (i.e., PIBO) and eventual interstitial fibrosis as an end-stage sequela in the dog reported here. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the dog developed BO and interstitial fibrosis for reasons not yet explored in companion animals.",

Surgical excision of bronchiectasis or segmental atelectic lung are performed if conservative therapy fails to achieve clinical improvement (4). Interestingly, our dog clinically improved after removal of the atelectic left cranial lung lobe as a puppy. The dog reported here was treated with numerous courses of various different antimicrobials by the primary care veterinarian over the course of 5 years without clinical improvement. Therapy over this time was not guided by confirmation of pathogenic organisms from airway sampling (e.g., BALF cytology, culture, or PCR). The lack of clinical improvement with multiple types and courses of antimicrobials makes repeated bacterial infections unlikely, but not impossible. Therefore, chronic-intermittent respiratory bacterial infections could not be ruled out as contributory to the development of fibrotic lung disease in this dog.",

The dog in this report strongly suggests PIBO can progress to widespread airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. It is unknown if targeted therapy (e.g., glucocorticoids) could have prevented or slowed fibrosis by diminishing inflammation leading to aberrant repair.
