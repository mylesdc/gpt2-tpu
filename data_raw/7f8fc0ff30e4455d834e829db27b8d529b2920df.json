We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker.",

However patients sharing similar viruses are potentially epidemiologically linked, so local outbreaks within the larger epidemic can be identified by finding transmission clusters. Clusters in epidemiology are broadly described as an unusual aggregation of infection, perceived to be greater than that expected by chance. In networks, clusters are quantitatively defined as a group of nodes having a local clustering coefficient significantly greater than that of a random graph with the same number of vertices and the same mean shortest path [11] . In a phylogenetic tree, clusters contain sequences from different patients which share a recent common ancestor. These clusters are manifest as groupings in the phylogenetic tree in which we have high confidence and which are likely to reflect recent or ongoing transmission. However, defining and detecting meaningful transmission clusters from a population sample in a phylogenetic tree is not straightforward, and various strategies have been proposed and used in the literature.",

For HIV, bootstraps ranging from 70% and up to 99% have been used [5, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , in combination with within-cluster genetic distances from 1% to 4.5% substitutions per site [3, [13] [14] [15] 17, 18] . The method for calculating within cluster genetic distance also varies: the mean of the pairwise genetic distances of clustered sequences has been employed [16] , as well as their median [19] . Another alternative is \"single linkage\", where a sequence is included in a cluster if its distance to just one other sequence in the cluster is below the threshold [20, 21] . If time resolved trees are used (which require knowledge or inference of a molecular clock), clusters can be defined based on time to most recent common ancestor [22] .

Initially, we fixed the bootstrap threshold in the CP at 90% and varied within-cluster maximum genetic distance between 1.5% and 7.5%. Between 4.5% and 7.5%, we found that for the most part, the same clusters were identified ( Figure 1A) . Within this range, the number of clusters stabilized around 128 (ranging from 126 to 131), with 2/3 containing only two sequences. At a genetic distance of 1.5%, only 63 clusters were identified. The proportion of sequences in clusters and average cluster size both increased as the genetic distance threshold was increased (Figure 2A) . At a maximum genetic distance of 4.5%, 25% of sequences clustered, identical to the proportion found after a time-resolved analysis of the same sequences [3] . Beyond 4.5%, the ratio of these two measures became constant, indicating that as the genetic distance cut-off was relaxed sequences were being added equally to all clusters. The effect of varying the cluster bootstrap threshold was different; fixing the genetic distance at 4.5%, the proportion of sequences in clusters decreased gradually as bootstrap thresholds were increased from 70% to 99% (Figures 1B and 2B ).",

The rooted subtype B tree containing 1381 sequences was analyzed in PhyloPart, varying the t-percentile threshold for cluster identification from 1% to 30%. Upon examination of the output, it appeared that this range reflected median genetic distances within clusters from 4.5% to 9% in the data. Once again, cluster distribution was not very much affected by the cut-off ( Figure 1C ), but the proportion of sequences in clusters and average cluster size increased as cluster definition was relaxed ( Figure 2C ). As a t-percentile threshold of 0.01 and 0.05 corresponded to genetic distance cut-offs of 4.5%, and 6.5%, respectively, the CP and PhyloPart output were compared in more depth at each of these two matched thresholds. Each time, the number of clusters and the cluster distributions were near identical (KS test, p = 0.9998 and p = 1 for 4.5% and 6.5% respectively). However, as expected, individual cluster sizes were significantly reduced when maximum within cluster genetic distance was used instead of median ( Figure 4 ; one-sample sign test, p = 6.1*10 -5 and p = 0.03 for genetic distances of 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively).",

Then, sets of 1000 tips were dropped sequentially from the tree to generate trees with variable number of tips (Additional file 2). As PhyloPart does not print time to completion, it was launched from within a python script with an additional function to calculate running time (Additional file 4). Both programs were able to process trees with up to 17,000 sequences in less than an hour on a desktop (Table 1 , Additional File 5), although PhyloPart did not terminate on the largest dataset (n = 18,000 sequences).

The CP is able to rapidly identify clusters in an automated way in large datasets, based on criteria demonstrated previously to accurately delineate epidemiologically relevant clusters [16] . Because in many cases cluster studies seek to combine genetic with epidemiological or clinical data (such as risk group or stage of infection), we have also made available the CM, which links clusters between runs and to epidemiological data. In contrast to some other methods available for the analysis of trait-annotated phylogenies [31, 32] , the CM does not require any assumptions to be made about the heritability of the traits examined, as it does not look for associations between the distribution of traits and the phylogeny, only summarizes their distribution. As an example, we used the tools together to investigate the dynamics of single vs. multiple origin HIV clusters in the UK, as well as conduct preliminary analyses of HCV and influenza clustering.",

We conclude that these clusters represent well-delineated epidemiological units in the UK HIV epidemic. In contrast, when the maximum genetic distance threshold was decreased to 1.5%, only half of the clusters were identified. These clusters defined by such a short distance will reflect recent transmissions and frequent samplings [17] . In contrast, the UK HIVRDB contains mostly sequences from chronically infected patients, many of whom were first sequenced long after infection, and so in order to identify relevant clusters, a threshold of 4.5%, as we have used before [3, 18] , is more appropriate. The effect of the bootstrap threshold was less evident, and so we conclude that genetic distance is the key parameter for epidemiologically relevant clustering. We stress however that the present analysis alone is not sufficient to yield a reusable definition of cluster threshold parameters, as the data set of publicly available sequences was too small for extensive testing. To resolve this issue, we are currently conducting in depth analyses on the UK HIVRDB as a whole (>50,000 sequences). Using the CP many thresholds can be examined very rapidly.",

            "text": "In order to highlight the CP's suitability to other viruses and epidemic patterns, we conducted analyses of HCV and three datasets of influenza sequences (see Additional file 1). The CP was able to pick out meaningful pandemic flu clades consistent with earlier work [33] , and the analysis of ladder-like seasonal influenza demonstrated the CP can accommodate different tree shapes, with sequences from the same year clustering together. At thresholds of 4.5% and 6.5%, PhyloPart (in grey, median GD) and the Cluster Picker (dashed, maximum GD) identified nearly exactly the same number of clusters (numbers above the columns) but PhyloPart clusters were on average larger. GD genetic distance. The CP uses maximum within cluster genetic distance, while PhyloPart, another recently released sequence clustering tool, uses the median. In previous studies, we have identified clusters in trees based on mean within cluster distance [18, 22] . However, we decided to use maximum genetic distance in our tool for three reasons. First, maximum genetic distance (as well as median genetic distance) is less affected by the number of sequences within a cluster (which can be the result of more or less intensive population sampling and contact tracing). When the mean is used, the distance is normalized by the total number of sequences in the cluster, potentially leading to clusters in which most of the sequences are very close together but one sequence is only distantly related to the group. Confirming this prediction, in our longitudinal analysis the genetic distance threshold did not have to be increased in 2007 to capture most 2005 clusters despite the additional of a large number of sequences. Second, maximum genetic distance is a metric more comparable to the time depth used to identify clusters in BEAST [22] . Third, maximum genetic distance is faster to compute, improving program efficiency. We nevertheless plan on adding alternative measures of genetic distance (mean and median) to future releases of the CP. Another difference between the programs is that distances are calculated de-novo from the sequences in the CP, while in PhyloPart, the patristic distances are used. Cluster definition in PhyloPart is a function of the whole tree: a subtree is classified as a cluster if its median genetic distance is smaller than a percentage of the whole tree. However, the user-specified genetic distance threshold in the CP allows external information to be incorporated into the definition, such as the average observed distance within transmission pairs if that is available. We chose this strategy because it is the most widely used definition; in fact, previous studies have demonstrated epidemiologically related viral sequences had less than 4.8% nucleotide substitutions between them [3] . Similarly, because studies vary in the bootstraps they use for support of clusters, we left this as a flexible option for the user to choose.",

Theoretically, PhyloPart will slow down in large datasets, as it calculates all pairwise distances then stores them, so they can be accessed each time they are needed. This is an advantage for smaller datasets and speeds up processing, but for large trees, the time to generate matrices of all pairwise distances increases as a polynomial function of the number of sequences n (n (n-1)/2 computations). The CP calculates pairwise genetic distances within a potential cluster as required even if those distances were already calculated when the parent node was tested (and rejected). Nevertheless, the CP was not slower than PhyloPart on small datasets and in fact completed on average three times more rapidly.",

Such real-time analyses are made possible by the CP and CM. As our purpose here was to demonstrate the functionality of the CP and CM, we chose a simple example. We hope that others will use the tools in more elaborate ways to truly provide insight into the dynamics of HIV transmission, as well as other infectious diseases. The CM, for example, can easily be used to compare clusters between trees built with different methods. Concerning cluster dynamics, we note that new sequences added to clusters do not necessarily reflect new infections: they could reflect new diagnoses within the time frame, and one potential explanation of the observed cluster growth may indeed be referralbased testing.",
