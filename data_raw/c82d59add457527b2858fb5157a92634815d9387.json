The ability of pathogens to cross borders and rapidly spread around the globe requires highly coordinated public health responses that involve the cooperation of local, regional, national, and supranational governments ( Figure  2 ). The understanding of this reality has informed the current International Health Regulations (IHR) revision process.",

Furthermore, the revisions have also outlined recommendations that the World Health Organization (WHO) could issue if an outbreak originating in one country is perceived to be a threat to other countries. The revision of the IHR is both long overdue and eminently necessary to face the challenges of an increasingly globalized world [2] . The practical implementation of these proposals, however, may encounter obstacles. This is particularly true for those WHO member nations that have federal systems of government (federations), and could ultimately threaten their ongoing support of the new regulations.",

Countries with federal governments make up about 40% of the world's population, and include the second most populous country (India) and the world's largest economy (United States) [4] . Federal systems of government offer many advantages, including allowing for the distinctiveness of the regions within a nation to be recognized and for region-specifi c policy approaches to be developed. However, one of the limitations of federations is that the division of powers can create an obstacle to the development of centralized approaches to national challenges. Such scenarios can arise when the country's constitution distributes the key powers in question to the regions. This characteristic of federal systems poses a dilemma when international treaties are signed by a federal government, but the cooperation of regional governments (states, provinces, etc.) is necessary for compliance with the treaty.",

However, there has been variability in the interpretation of this clause, with certain countries claiming that this requires the use of any constitutional power available to adhere to the agreement, and others arguing that this clause should not allow internal Applicability Narrow list of three specifi c diseases All events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, which is any event that: (1) may constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease; and/or (2) that may require a coordinated international response Authorities responsible for communication with WHO Unspecifi ed beyond general reference to a country's health administration (\"the governmental authority responsible over the whole of a territory to which these regulations apply\") Stipulates that each state party: (1) will designate a single National IHR Focal Point, \"which shall be accessible at all times for communications with WHO\" and which will disseminate information to, and consolidate input, from relevant sectors of the administration; and (2) will establish \"the authorities responsible within its respective jurisdiction for the implementation of health measures\" Surveillance system Narrow health and sanitary requirements for international carriers and at borders only Ports of entry and routine inspection and control standards, plus detailed core public health requirements at local and national levels to be met within a specifi c time frame (explicit state obligation to develop, strengthen, and maintain the capacity to detect, report, and respond to public health events) Sources of information Offi cial country notifi cations only All relevant offi cial and unoffi cial info, including from nongovernmental organizations, individual experts, media, and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network Issuance of alerts, advisories and recommendations By the Director-General in an ad hoc manner, and only to national authorities By an emergency committee formed from a roster of experts, according to formal criteria, with joint participation of affected states, to national authorities and to the international community in general; either temporary or standing; subject to scrutiny by a review committee federal structures to be compromised [18, 19] . The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has generated similar challenges to implementation in federal states, and it is notable that two key federations, the US and Australia, have not ratifi ed the treaty [20] . The problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. First, as already mentioned, the necessary powers to ensure compliance with a treaty may not fall within the jurisdiction of the federal level of government. While in many federations, the federal power to sign treaties may permit them to override the jurisdiction of regional governments, this is not necessarily always the case. And in scenarios in which the federal government does have the necessary constitutional authority, they may choose not to exercise it because of political concerns about creating confl ict with regional governments. Even in scenarios in which the federal government has the necessary legislative power and does choose to exercise it, regional governments may not be able to cope with the fi nancial and/or practical burdens of compliance [21] . This latter issue, of unfunded mandates, is not unique to federal states and constitutes a challenge that all WHO member nations will need to address when determining how to implement the surveillance requirements of the new IHR.",

It is primarily incumbent upon federations, as responsible members of the international community, to take every measure available to ensure that they can comply with the new IHR. These measures would include using what constitutional means may be available to centralize necessary public health powers concerning surveillance and outbreak response, making efforts to establish effective collaborative intergovernmental arrangements, and developing appropriate public health capacity at the local level. The intergovernmental acrimony to which federations are susceptible would clearly not be acceptable if, at a time of crisis, it produced a dysfunctional response that resulted in the international spread of disease.",

These efforts could include the provision of guidelines on strategies federal governments can use to address some of the challenges we have described. For example, the constitutions of some federations may have unexploited powers that federal governments could utilize to gain the necessary authority. Constitutions are often interpreted in a fl exible manner by courts, in recognition of the realities of a changing world. The threat of pandemic infections could be taken strongly into consideration when courts are interpreting the use of federal powers. Of course, there are important limitations to this strategy, including the fact that any constitutional interpretation will need to strike a balance between new public health powers and respect for fundamental human rights and traditional allocations of government power, both of which may constrain the expansion of federal authority. Furthermore, heavy-handed, topdown approaches to managing disease outbreaks are not ideal, given the critical importance of local and regional public health activities. Ideally, responses would be a collaborative venture between orders of government.",

The likelihood of adherence to such agreements would be greatly enhanced if conditional funding were provided by the federal government to assist in developing the necessary surveillance and response infrastructure at the local level. This option is particularly important to consider because adequate federal powers will have no effect in the absence of adequate surveillance infrastructure or public health capacity. Governance strategies must go hand in hand with effective surveillance and the development of necessary public health capacity [22] .",
