Some mass gatherings such as outdoor sporting events may involve limited social mixing and are held in settings with ample ventilation. Other mass gatherings, however, can involve significant social mixing over several days such as professional conferences and music festivals [1] [2] [3] [4] . Intensely crowded settings can lead to high secondary attack rates even when a circulating pathogen has a relatively low transmission probability [1] [2] [3] [4] . Travelers to mass gatherings can not only introduce an infectious disease to a previously unaffected area, but can also amplify transmission at the gathering and further disseminate transmission following their return home. This was recently demonstrated by the propagation of the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pdm09H1N1) following a large Easter holiday gathering in Iztapalapa, Mexico [6] . Similar mass gatherings have been linked to the propagation of the Great Pandemic in 1918 and the Asian Flu Pandemic in 1957 [7] [8] .",

More than half (n = 44, 61%) of the 72 identified outbreaks occurred at state or county agricultural fairs ( Table 3 ). All of these fairs were large multiday events ranging between 5 to 12 days with a mean daily attendance of 33,000 persons (personal communication on subset of fairs for which data were available: Marla Calico, International Association of Fairs and Exhibitions). Forty outbreaks were reported between 2011 and 2012 and involved transmission of Influenza A H3N2v at fairs across 9 states. The largest outbreak occurred at an agricultural fair in Indiana and resulted in 73 confirmed and probable cases. In this, as well as other H3N2v outbreaks, the majority of case-patients reported close contact with swine at the agricultural fairs, though additional but limited secondary person-to-person transmission was detected [33] [34] [35] [36] . Children and adolescents less than 18 years of age represented the largest percentage of case-patients (92%) during these outbreaks [36] . Three outbreaks of Influenza A H1N1 (3SIV) occurred at agricultural fairs in 2007 in Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan [20] [21] . The swine barn housed 235 pigs belonging to 133 exhibitors and was closed as a result of the outbreak in Ohio [20] . A single case of Influenza A H3N2 (3SIV) was detected in a 12-year old boy after attending an agricultural fair in Kansas in 2009.",

Each lasted for three days or more and involved either Influenza A (H1N1) (n = 25) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] or mumps (n = 2) [16] [17] [30] [31] . The size of most camp sessions was small, ranging between 100 to 600 campers and staff. Nineteen (76%) of the 25 Influenza A H1N1 (pdm09H1N1) outbreaks were reported from an online survey of 2009 summer camp participants in Maine [25] . In this survey, camp-related outbreaks (defined as having at least three confirmed cases of pdm09H1N1) were statistically associated with having both a larger number of camp participants per session and a larger number of campers per cabin. The six other camp-related pdm09H1N1 outbreaks occurred in North Carolina (n = 3) [22] [23] [27] [28] , Louisiana (n = 1) [24] , Alabama (n = 1) [26] , and Washington State (n = 1) [29] . One outbreak involved 119 cases occurring across two clusters in a multi-camp setting at a North Carolina university with more than 7,900 participants [32] [33] . The authors found that this transmission occurred rapidly during academic camps and was likely due to close and frequent [24] ) closed early due to the large number of participants presenting influenza-like-illness (ILI). Two mumps outbreaks were identified in this review-both occurred at a camp for boys in upstate New York following international importations of infectious mumps cases from the United Kingdom. The first outbreak took place in 2007 and resulted in 31 cases among 541 campers and staff; the staff represented 60% of all case-patients [16] [17] . The second occurred in 2009 and caused 25 cases among 400 campers and staff [30] [31] . In both outbreaks, transmission was associated with prolonged close contact in communal housing and camp activities despite a two-dose MMR vaccination coverage > 85% among school-aged campers. A delay in mumps diagnosis also likely contributed to the 2007 outbreak. During the 2007 outbreak, camp activities were either cancelled or postponed [16] [17] . These outbreaks resulted in substantial community transmission when campers returned home-more than 1,500 community cases (including 19 hospitalizations) occurred in New York and New Jersey in 2009 [30] [31] .",

Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks appeared to be relatively rare during our 10-year project period, but were reported from agricultural fairs (zoonotic transmission) and summer camps where participants had close social contact in communal housing. Though legionellosis outbreaks were more common, none of these water-borne outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering in our analysis. The type and duration (multi-day events with communal housing) of mass gatherings could be important factors in mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. International participation may be a contributing factor for certain diseases. As anticipated, we identified several mass gathering-related pdm09H1N1 outbreaks involving school-aged children [41] . These persons are a high-risk age group for the novel 2009 influenza virus. Compared to other settings, influenza transmission among children and teenagers is more likely to occur within households, school classes, peer groups, and sports teams [42] [43] [44] -all of these social mixing opportunities are prominent at summer camps. Children and adolescents can easily have more than 20 close contacts with other children lasting 5 minutes of more during a typical school day [45] . Both the number and duration of close contacts could be higher in residential camps. This is supported by the outbreaks reported from Maine where the camp size and the number of campers per cabin were associated with influenza outbreaks [25] . Though respiratory disease transmission can occur at summer camps, influenza transmission during the summer (in the United States) outside a pandemic is uncommon; pdm09HIN1 was circulating since early spring and was involved a number of school-based outbreaks in states reporting camp-related influenza outbreaks in summer 2009. No respiratory illnesses were detected from a syndromic surveillance system implemented at a large school-aged summer camp in Virginia in 2005 [40] .",

The syndromic surveillance system using emergency department chief complaint data was analyzed to detect the initial H3N2v outbreak in Indiana (personal communication: Shawn Richards, Indiana State Department of Health). This highlights the usefulness of such systems to rapidly detect temporal or spatial clusters of unusual health events associated with fairs and other mass gatherings. The mumps and measles outbreaks demonstrate the importance of close collaboration between public health officials and mass gathering organizers to assess health risks to participants. As recommended in the articles, camp and sporting event organizers should verify immunization histories of all registered participants and team members [17, 31] . This is particularly important for measles, which is highly contagious through aerosolized viral particles; other control and prevention measures are likely to be ineffective. Organizers should also obtain information on disease transmission in the home countries of participants. These pregathering activities can help with the early case detection and outbreak prevention. The 2007 mumps outbreak, for example, was attributed to the international importation of mumps in a staff member followed by the delayed recognition of suspected mumps cases and prolonged and close contact between campers in communal housing [16] [17] .",

This is consistent with previous assessments of international mass gatherings such as the Olympics that detected only marginal increases above baseline in the incidence of all infectious diseases including influenza with infections primarily limited to competitors and staff [5, 47] . Though we assume that all mass gatherings could increase the transmission of respiratory diseases, this may not be the case for diseases transmitted through infectious droplets where the probability of close and adequate contact (i.e., < 6 feet for influenza) with an infectious person may be too low for efficient transmission [49] . Even at large mass gatherings involving out-of-town visitors such as the May 2009 convocation speech in Arizona (during which no respiratory disease outbreaks were detected) [37] , most participants likely stayed at hotels or at other low-density accommodations rather than in cabins or at campgrounds [5, 49] . In addition, many of these gatherings have well organized and pre-assigned seating. This could further reduce the 'crowdedness' and likelihood of close and prolonged contact with infectious persons [5] . This can be contrasted to the type of communal housing and social mixing associated with camp outbreaks described here. Variability in susceptibility among attendees as well as in the timing of the gathering in relation to local respiratory disease activity also likely play a role in transmission [9] .",

We used a broad database search criteria to minimize this limitation and identify all possible articles describing mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Second, some outbreaks may not be identified as outbreaks. Active or passive surveillance likely influences the number of infectious respiratory disease outbreaks identified and reported. For example, active surveillance for variants of influenza viruses at fairs following the initial H3N2v outbreak in 2011 could have increased the number of outbreaks detected from this setting. In addition, while multiday residential-based mass gatherings can facilitate transmission, these settings may also help identify cases and an emerging outbreak through close monitoring of known participants. In non-residential settings, other non-disease related factors including crowd mood, age, weather, and alcohol and drug use could influence the use of illness-related medical services. These factors could further increase the variability of health event reporting [14] . Third, some respiratory diseases with longer incubation periods and many subclinical infections are unlikely to be identified during the mass gathering. Symptoms could appear once the participants have returned home and are then rarely linked or reported to the appropriate surveillance system [9, 49] .",

In Brazil, for example, a smart phone application was developed allowing persons attending the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide information on their daily health status. This information was automatically aggregated into reports that were reviewed daily to identify potential infectious disease clusters or outbreaks [51] . Monitoring social media including Twitter was used to identify potential health issues and communicate accurate information about disease transmission during the 2012 London Olympics [52] . These approaches can complement other surveillance systems such as collection and analysis of syndromic event data from emergency department visits or onsite medical clinics [37] . Integration of these various platforms through a web-based system could allow public health officials to rapidly detect unusual disease activity [10, 53] even at smaller mass gatherings [54] [55] . Recent research has also focused on the use of radio frequency identification devices [56] [57] as well as video analysis technology [58] to capture social mixing and contact patterns at mass gatherings. These contact data can be used to simulate or model the transmission of various infectious disease pathogens including pandemic influenza. Simulations or mathematical models can help describe the risk of potential outbreaks and highlight where and when enhanced disease transmission mitigation at mass gatherings should be considered.",
