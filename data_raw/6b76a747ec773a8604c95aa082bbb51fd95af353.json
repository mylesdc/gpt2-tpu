Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model's hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the",

In 2013, the first outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in the U.S. shook the industry both economically and socially, and required us to rethink effective disease-prevention strategies (1, 2) . PEDv is now an endemic disease and it is one of the most severe infectious diseases in the hog industry with \u223c80-100% morbidity and 50-90% mortality in suckling piglets (3, 4) . The virus can spread via direct, indirect and possibly airborne transmission mechanisms (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Direct transmission involves animal-to-animal contact while indirect transmission implies exposure to contaminated fomites. Furthermore, both animal and environment can be reservoirs of the virus for long periods, making it difficult to predict the time and place of new outbreaks (13) . There is no single successful control strategy for PEDv, in part because of the complexity and large size of the swine population, but also because of poorly-understood transmission vectors, including inconsistent, and occasionallyirrational behavior by humans in the industry. Thus, one aspect of the problem has become clear: livestock disease spread is not only epidemiological but also a matter of human behavior, specifically the choices producers make to implement biosecurity protocols or not (14) .",

The data also exhibit seasonal cycles with winter seasons generally carrying higher PEDv incidence. While there are likely a number of factors influencing the variability in the data, we became interested in the steady decreasing trend. Since the pathways of virus transmission have stayed the same through time, why has incidence decreased? Likely, this is evidence of a change in the response to disease within the production system. We therefore investigate how shifts in human behaviors and risk mitigation strategies longitudinally affect contagion dynamics.",

Biosecurity practices such as disinfecting footwear, showering and wearing clean clothes before entering production premises, vehicle washing and disinfecting can be employed to mitigate PEDv transmission both within and between farms (15) (16) (17) . Although producers have access to biosecurity information and implementation 1 http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd instructions, their risk attitude can influence the willingness to comply with biosecurity protocols (18, 19) . Hereafter, we refer to this operational willingness to obey the rules as \"compliance\" with biosecurity protocols. Failure to comply with biosecurity practices can lead to infection, increased mortality of pigs of all ages and economic losses for the farm. A second aspect of biosecurity is the willingness by managers and owners to invest in biosecurity, for example purchasing truck-washing equipment or installing air-filtration systems. For this reason, human decision-making factors, in addition to epidemiological factors, are essential pieces needed to understand disease dynamics and their associated economic repercussions (20) .",

However, not everybody perceives disease risk in the same way (20, 22) and biosecurity practices are not applied homogenously and at the same level across farms (23, 24) . Critical research on human decision-making shows that behaviors are not immutable and can be nudged toward standards that are more beneficial both for the individual and the larger community (25) . In the case of disease for example, both the producer and the production system can benefit from improved disease control by shifting individual producers' behaviors toward higher biosecurity engagement (20) . The integration of epidemiological and social disciplines can provide insights (26) on the effect of shifts in human behavior directed at protecting farms from disease incursions.",

ABMs are computational models that attempt to capture the behavior of autonomous agents within their environment. An ABM usually consists of: (1) Agents, which represent actors characterized by attributes and behaviors; (2) Agent relationships and functions for their interactions and; (3) an environment in which the agents are embedded and with which they can interact. Sometimes agents can be part of a population and share characteristics and/or behaviors. Agents can receive information and/or learn and therefore have adaptive capabilities. The strength of ABMs is the ability to model complex systems from the bottom up with agents that have believable and realistic behaviors (33, 34) . In situations characterized by risk as in the onset of a disease outbreak, the heterogeneity of human responses can lead to complex and dynamic outcomes challenging to foresee. Therefore, modeling agents with human-like characteristics including the ability to appraise and respond to events also with non-rational behaviors, is essential for social-ecological studies (18, 35) . An example of the potential of ABMs for epidemiological applications came from the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Studies (MIDAS 2 ). In this collaborative effort, a set of ABMs was developed to investigate avian flu transmission incorporating epidemiological, environmental and social aspects and has been used to analyze outbreaks, model outcomes of interventions involving human behaviors and shape policies to help reduce the impact of avian influenza (34) . Because ABMs allow explicit modeling of decision-making processes, interactions and networks, they represent an effective approach for simulating the system 2 https://www.epimodels.org/drupal-new/ structure of the swine industry, specifically by incorporating both disease dynamics emerging from virus transmission with animal and feed movement, and human decision processes influencing biosecurity and movement interactions.",

The hog production chain simulated for this study is a system mirroring the density, operation types and sizes of production units found in North Carolina with data provided by the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) tool which draws from the USDA Census of Agriculture and aerial images (39) . Feed mills and slaughter plants were initialized at random locations with numbers obtained from public data and expert advising. Hog production in the U.S. is increasing, which has resulted in increased vertical integration. Multiple sites are used in the production flow with specialized sites for sows, weanlings, growers and finishing pigs, or any combination of these growth stages. The ABM production agents are therefore also characterized by one of six holding types (farrow-to-wean, wean-to-feeder, feeder-to-finish, farrow-tofinish, wean-to-finish, and feeder-to-finish), size (total number of animals), and number of pig batches (groups of pigs of the same age). Other structural parameters include the basic functions of the hog production system such as the process of birth and growth. Birth, growth and movements of pigs are modeled at the group level using batches of pigs of the same age. The production system of the hog industry requires transfer of hogs from one holding type to the next and in the end to the slaughter plant. For instance, in a three-site production system a pig batch moves from farrow-to-wean to wean-to-feeder to feederto-finish sites before finally being sent to the slaughter plant. Pig batch movement as well as feed deliveries generate heterogeneous interactions among agents and are included in the ABM using networks of transportation (Supplementary Figure 1) . These networks are modeled with agents having set trading and service areas according to their industry role and characterized by neighborhood structures.",

It is coupled with a stochastic state transition model including Susceptible (S) and Infectious (I) states. Probability functions regulate the transmission of disease in single agent interactions while the network structure of animal and feed movement determine the ultimate pattern of disease spread. Each simulated agent (hog producers, slaughter plants, and feed mills) may become infected (state I) during an interaction with another agent with a probability that depends on the type of interaction, the agent's biosecurity and a seasonality factor. Specifically, each type of movement interaction is associated with an independent probability of infection calculated using a logistic function. The logistic functions describe the infection probability's dependence on the agent's biosecurity with coefficients derived from the estimates provided using expert opinion. The seasonal variability in PEDv infectivity is modeled as a sinusoidal adjustment on the logistic probability function that varies with time and ultimately generates higher infection probabilities in winter and lower in summer. Explicit representation of disease spread mechanisms and functions for our ABM are detailed in the Supplementary Material section titled The agent-based model's epidemiological sub-model.",

In particular, the agents' riskattitude is directly linked to their response to disease by determining the threshold number of neighboring infected production premises necessary for an agent to react and increase its biosecurity with a probability >0.9. We associate risk aversion with higher propensity to adopt biosecurity. For example, risk averse agents almost always increase biosecurity as soon as there are three production premises infected in their veterinarian network. On the opposite side of the risk spectrum, risk tolerant agents increase their biosecurity quasi certainly only when they know that there are nine or more infected production premises in their veterinarian network. In summary, the ABM agent behavior originates from a risk attitude distribution with four categories (risk averse, risk opportunists, risk neutral, and risk tolerant); four forms of disease response, one for each risk attitude category are used to simulate biosecurity response-to-disease strategies; and a utility function for psychological distancing, which simulates the waning of biosecurity compliance since an infection event.

Our outputs demonstrate that the mechanisms and parameterization of the ABM are capable of reproducing decreasing PEDv incidence through time thanks to the dynamics of human behavior where agents could respond to PEDv presence by increasing biosecurity. In other words, the human behavioral assumptions built into our ABM influencing biosecurity and disease transmission probabilities, allowed the realizations of negative incidence trends. Furthermore, the higher propensity to increase biosecurity assigned to risk averse agents did result in lower incidence when there was a sufficient number of risk averse agents in the population. Despite the fact that most of the simulations missed the observed initial high peak of incidence, the shaded areas displaying the averaged Monte Carlo outputs plus and minus one standard deviation demonstrate that the ABM did realize disease outbreaks with high peaks of incidence.",

Our model outputs reproduced a significant decrease in PEDv incidence through time. An important finding from our scenario analysis was that the average decreasing trend is significantly affected by the model's initial state, defining the proportion of the producer agents assigned to two risk categories, risk averse and risk tolerant. An increase as small as 10% more risk averse producer agents resulted in a 19% decrease in the median total PEDv incidence, which is equivalent to 36 fewer PEDv cases over the course of the analysis period (\u223c4 years). To observe a significantly steeper decrease in incidence requires that more than 37.5% of the population be in the risk averse category. The implication is that biosecurity adoption and influencing factors of adoption (for example risk attitude) are a critical consideration when creating strategic plans or policies for disease control. Our modeling analysis reinforces the message found not only in fieldspecific papers but also in general papers such as in (42) who calls for developing more effective approaches for integrating social dynamics of epidemics to build more realistic models. PEDv incidence data are highly variable and reflect the complex social-ecological structure of the swine industry. While the Monte Carlo results capture much of the system variability, different parameter sets appear to more closely align with the observed PEDv data (Figures 3-6) , i.e., the initial conditions allowed us to calculate the fraction of simulation runs whose patterns are statistically close to the recorded incidence patterns. An interesting finding is that a producer-agent population with only 12.5% agents in the risk averse category resulted in statistical indicators where the median is closer to the observed value. In considering potential adjustments for our model, this result suggests to use the risk-attitude distribution from 12.5% averse scenario as a model set-up for realizations closer to the observed PEDv pattern.",

The inter-annual variability for example is visible in the timing of the observed incidence peaks (Figure 6 top panel, example: the 2015-2016 winter peak occurred earlier than in 2014-2015). Our ABM uses a sinusoidal function calibrated to peak in January and therefore produces incidence oscillations that are more regular with time. A variety of reasons can be postulated to explain the complex variability in the observations including weather variability, changes in production components and/or routes and stochastic factors affecting disease spread. Our model simulates a closed production system where all the hog and feed movements are bounded within the region. Even if designed around the North Carolina configuration of production premises, the model does not include the complex network system that extends beyond the state boundary into other U.S. states. These out-of-state movements add potential for disease transmission and may contribute to the higher observed incidence compared to the averaged simulated one.",

By weaving human behavioral components into epidemiological processes, our ABM is a unique tool for evaluating the effects and efficacy of disease control strategies compared to more traditional epidemiological models that lack social dynamics. Our ABM was equipped with two behavioral processes that act in opposition: (1) responsiveness to regional disease incidence with consequent increase in biosecurity and (2) psychological distancing with consequent decrease in biosecurity as time increases since an infection. Model calibration provided the appropriate tension between the two processes to match the observed decreasing trend in PEDv incidence. With these two behavioral processes we were able to capture important features of the PEDv dynamics as shown in our results. We recognize however that there is a variety of interplaying socio-psychological factors that influence decisions, as skillfully illustrated by Mankad (18) . Yet our ABM is a simplified but progressive effort toward more realistic representation of epidemics.",

All industry actors are aware of the devastating consequences of disease incursion. The regular reemergence of PEDv indicates that there is still work to do on the epidemiology and microbiology of the virus but also on the role of humans, which necessitates the investigation of practices carried out in the industry and behaviors that allow the virus to survive and become active. Intensive research efforts in the past 5 years have brought new information about the viability of the virus (5, 7, 12, 30, 40, (45) (46) (47) , and vaccines have been researched in various countries around the world. Vaccine efficacy has shown to be low (48) although a recent study had promising results with a new vaccine that was immunogenic and effective in growing pigs (49) . Prevention of the virus therefore relies on good biosecurity practices with active participation of producers and all industry stakeholders in this complex supply chain network. Crucial for biosecurity to work is the proper training of staff and a culture of compliance with the protocols.",

Our study suggests that shifting producer attitudes toward risk aversion is beneficial for the whole production system because it will result in reduced disease incidence. In balancing cost and benefits of biosecurity, our modeling outputs show that an engaged effort from the population of producers toward more risk averse, biosecure behaviors (e.g., readiness to enhance biosecurity and limiting psychological distancing) is effective in the control and reduction of PEDv spread. Our study points at the substantial opportunity provided by shifting behavior; however, from a production system perspective, altering a substantial proportion of a population's behavior represents a significant challenge.

However, in this research we coded biosecurity investment decisions based on the risk of acquiring a disease. Obviously, disease risk is an important factor when considering biosecurity, but it is not the only factor. A complex array of factors exists that influence biosecurity decisions that differ by individual and further depend upon the objectives of the organization, regional policies, logistical factors, and the array of behaviors by other actors in the swine network (e.g., feed mills, truck drivers, veterinarians, slaughter plants, processors, auction houses, etc.). Yet, research has shown that risk attitude can be an important decision-making factor. Like all models, our \"model is wrong, but hopefully it is useful\" (attributed to George Box 1976) because it provides a quantitative approximation for how human behavior and decisions can influence the spread of disease.",

We geared our epidemiological model with human behavioral processes connected to biosecurity and disease, and demonstrated the opportunity and impact associated with changing biosecurity behavior on PEDv incidence or, with a more positive spin, a healthier animal production systems. If on one side, targeted interventions to critical nodes of a production system may prove important to inhibit disease \"super-spreaders, \" on the other, our study shows that shifts in the overall industry toward a more risk averse culture can yield more biosecure facilities along with consistent and long-term industry-wide protection from disease.",
