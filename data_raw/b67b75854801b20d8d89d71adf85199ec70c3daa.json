Early detection of disease outbreaks enables public health officials to implement disease control and prevention measures at the earliest possible time. For an infectious disease, improvement in detection time by even one day might enable public health officials to control the disease before it becomes widespread. In many cities such as New York City [1] , Washington, D.C. [2] , Boston [3, 4] , Denver, and Minneapolis, real-time, geographic, early outbreak detection system have been implemented. For a well-defined geographical area, standard disease surveillance uses purely temporal methods that seek anomalies in time series data without using spatial information [5] . The increased need for geographical cluster detection has coincided with an increasing availability of spatial data [6] . Investigators ask whether the geographical cluster is unlikely to have arisen by chance given random variations from the background incidence, according for the multiple comparisons inherent in the many possible cluster locations and size evaluated. Scan statistics are tools to answer such questions [7, 8] . Increasingly, there is interest in the prospective surveillance of new data as it becomes available in order to detect a localized disease outbreak as early as possible. Particularly in light of the perceived threat of bioterrorism and newly emerging infectious diseases, there has been a spate of recent interest in the development of geographic surveillance systems that can detect changes in spatial patterns of disease [9] . Recently, a time periodic geographical disease surveillance system based on a cylindrical space-time scan statistic was proposed by Kulldorff and colleagues [10, 11] .",

            "text": "Several different approaches to the statistical assessment of potential geographic clustering in either point-or areabased disease data have been developed [12, 13] . Almost all of these purely spatial approaches are retrospective, in the sense that they describe statistical tests that are designed to be carried out once, on a set of data that has been collected from the recent past [9] . In particular, the circular spatial scan statistic [8] has been used extensively for the detections and evaluation of purely spatial disease clusters along with the SaTScan software [14] . For example, as part of their cancer surveillance initiative, the New York State Department of Health used the spatial scan statistic to look at the geographical variation of breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer incidence in New York State, finding various statistically significant clusters but no local hotspots with greatly elevated risk [15] . However, as the statistic uses a circular scanning window with variable size to define the potential cluster area, it is difficult to correctly detect some non-circular clusters such as those along a river [16] . Recently, spatial scan statistics for irregular shaped clusters have been proposed, using the same likelihood ratio test formulation as before. The spatial scan statistics proposed by Duczmal and Assun\u00e7\u00e3o [17] , Patil and Taillie [18] , Tango and Takahashi [16] , Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. [19] and Kulldorff et al. [20] are aimed at detecting irregularly shaped clusters which may not be detected by the circular spatial scan statistic. Due to the unlimited geometric freedom of cluster shapes, some of these statistics run the risk of detecting quite large and very peculiarly shaped clusters. The flexible spatial scan statistic [16] , which has been used along with the FleXScan software [21] , has a parameter K as the pre-set maximum length of neighbors to be scanned, to avoid detecting clusters with a very peculiar shape.",

The cylindrical spacetime scan statistic uses a cylindrical window in three dimensions where the base of the cylinder represents space and the height represents time. As with the purely spatial scan statistic, the cylindrical space-time scan statistic imposes a circular base Z on each centroid of regions for each of T time intervals. For each of centroids, the radius of the circle is varied from zero up to a pre-set maximum radius, for example, so that the window never includes more than 50% of the total population at risk [8] . In this paper, we use a pre-set maximum number of regions K to be included in the cluster as an upperbound of the radius. If the base contains the centroid of a region, then that whole region is included in the base. In total, a very large number of different but overlapping circular bases are created, each with a different set of neighboring regions and each being a possible candidate area containing a disease outbreak. Let Z ik , k = 1,...,K, denote the base composed by the region i and the (k -1)-nearest neighbors to i. Then, all the cylindrical windows to be scanned by the cylindrical scan statistic are the cylinders with the base in the set which we propose in this paper imposes a three dimensional prismatic window with an arbitrarily shaped base Z. For any given region i, we create the set of arbitrarily shaped bases consisting of k connected regions (1 \u2264 k \u2264 K) including i. To avoid detecting a cluster of unlikely peculiar shape, the connected regions are restricted as the subset of the K-nearest neighbors to the region i, where K = 1 implies the region i itself. Let Z ik(j) , j = 1,...,j ik denote the jth window which is a set of k regions connected starting from the region i, where j ik is the number of j satisfying Z ik(j) \u2286 Z iK for k = 1,...,K. Then, all the windows to be scanned are the prisms whose base is included in the set with height in the set . In other words, for any given region i, the cylindrical scan statistic consider K concentric circles for the base, whereas the flexible scan statistic consider K concentric circles plus all the sets of connected regions including the single region i, whose centroids are located within the K-th largest concentric circle. where LLR v and LLR* is the value of the test statistic for the v-th Monte Carlo replicate and that for the observed data, respectively, and I(\u00b7) is the indicator function.",

For the outbreak in cluster A with a single ZIP code, the cylindrical scan statistic has higher power to detect the cluster with complete accuracy, with P1(l = 1, s = 1, t = 1 | s*, t*) = 697/1000, compared to 315/1000 for the flexible. Moreover, the flexible scan statistic has a heavier tail in the (s, t) = (1, 3) column than the cylindrical one. However the cylindrical scan detected some large clusters including several with l \u2265 15. For outbreaks in the non-circular shaped A5 and Rockaway clusters, the flexible scan statistic has higher power for complete accurate detection. Indeed, the cylindrical scan statistic cannot detect these clusters with complete accuracy since they are not circular, so that the power for complete accuracy is zero. Moreover, note that for cluster A5, the flexible scan statistic is more likely to include all the five areas in the true cluster (797 + 12 = 809/1000 versus 601 + 12 = 613/ 1000), and it is also more likely to avoid including any of the ZIP codes outside the true cluster (12 + 74 + 2 + 287 + 3 = 378/1000 versus 37 + 1 + 301 + 7 = 346/1000). For the Rockaway cluster, the flexible scan statistic is again more likely to include all the five areas in the true cluster (667 + 4 + 1 = 672 versus 1 + 0 + 1 = 1), but the cylindrical scan statistic avoids the ZIP codes outside the cluster more often (2 + 8 + 52 + 1 + 876 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 946/1000 versus 0 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 181 + 1 + 0 + 571 + 2 + 0 = 761/ 1000). Tables 5 and 6 show that the temporal accuracy of the detected cluster is very good for both methods. For example, for cluster A5, the flexible scan has P1(+, +, 3 | s*, t*) = \u2211l \u2211sP1(l, s, 3 | s*, t*) = (15 + 171 + 797)/1000 = 0.983 while the cylindrical scan has P1(+, +, 3 | s*, t*) = (41 + 338 + 601)/1000 = 0.980.",

For the small irregular shaped clusters, A5 and Rockaways, the cylindrical performs better on the first day of the outbreak, but as more data accumulates, the flexible scan statistic has certain advantages in determining the precise size and shape of the outbreak. For the large and narrow Hudson River cluster, the flexible scan statistic performs better than the cylindrical one, with slightly higher standard power, much higher PPV and slightly higher or lower sensitivity depending on the type of cylindrical method used. Results may be different for other types of regular and irregularly shaped disease outbreaks, but the four examples used in this paper gives some sense of the proposed methods performance.",

When monitoring an occurring outbreak, on the other hand, geographical accuracy becomes critical and is then the key objective since we already know the outbreak is there. Our results suggest that we may use both the cylindrical and flexible scan statistic for disease outbreak detection, but for different purposes. Specifically, for detecting new outbreak that, one may want to use the cylindrical scan statistic. That is especially if we expect the outbreak to start locally, within a reasonably small and compact area containing only a few ZIP-codes. On the other hand, once the outbreak has spread to a larger area, and we want to monitor that spread, one may want to use the flexible scan statistic, with its ability to accuratly determine the precise geographical extent of irregular shaped outbreaks. This is especially true ones the outbreak has left its local area of origin.",

Also we applied the profile Q(r | s*) proposed by Takahashi and Tango [26] . This plot gave us a detailed description regarding power of cluster detection tests. Needless to say, it is possible to extend it to space-time version if we could consider the penalties for temporal false negatives and false positives, but we leave this problem for future work. Also, for the profile of the extended power, we chose to use a fixed cost of w -= 1/s* for false negatives and a smaller or equal cost for false positives. For more general situations, we could plot the full bivariate extended power function on the unit square.",

The proposed scan statistic works well for small to moderate sized clusters. Although we set the maximum length of the geographical window to K = 20, this is not large enough to detect the 20 ZIP codes of the Hudson River cluster accurately because this cluster is too long to be the subset of the 20-th nearest neighbors of any region. Computation time depends on the size of the data set and K. Indeed, for the August 11 analysis of respiratory syndrome data in Massachusetts, with 385 ZIP codes, a maximum temporal length of T = 7 days, a maximum spatial size of K = 20, and A limitation of length may also prevent the analysis to present large clusters of unlikely and very peculiar shapes. These undesirable properties produced by maximum likelihood ratio might suggest the use of different criterion for model selection, including some penalized likelihood [20, 29] . Also, for larger cluster seizes, the method is not practically feasible and a more efficient algorithm is needed.",

This does not allow the scanning window to adjust itself as the disease outbreak grows or shrinks geographically over time. Recently, Iyengar has suggested using a square pyramid shape window which can model either growth (or shrinkage) and movement of the disease cluster [30] . For the proposed flexible space-time scan statistic, if we could consider the flexibility in both space and time, that is, evaluating all connected subsets within a cylinder instead of in (4), we can detect more arbitrarily shaped clusters in space-time. For such an expansion, an efficient computational algorithm will be needed for the scanning process, as well as a more sophisticated mechanism for the interpretation of such complicatedly shaped clusters. The implementation and importance of such methods for disease surveillance and monitoring, is an issue for future research.",

The number 100 was chosen to reflect the occurrence rate of certain syndromes common to the NYC emergency department(ED)-based syndromic surveillance system. Under the null model, each person living in NYC is equally likely to contract the disease, and the time of each case is assigned with equal probability to any given day. Thus, each case was randomly assigned to ZIP code i and day d with probability proportional to \u03bc id = pop i , where pop i is the population of ZIP code i. For the alternative models, one or more ZIP codes were assigned an increased risk on Day 31 and, when applicable, on Days 32 and 33 as well. For these ZIP code and day combinations, \u03bc id was multiplied by an assigned relative risk. For all other ZIP code and day combinations, \u03bc id did not change. Each case was then randomly assigned with probability proportional to the new set of \u03bc id to generate data under the alternative models.Eight alternative models were evaluated, based on four different outbreak areas of length s* and total population pop* therein, with either high or medium relative risk (RR)[22] (Figure 2).1.
