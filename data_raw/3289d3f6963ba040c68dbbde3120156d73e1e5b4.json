We propose cluster finding to be a two-step process: first, possible transmission clusters are identified using a cluster algorithm, second, the plausibility that the identified clusters represent genuine transmission clusters is evaluated. Aim: To introduce visual tools to assess automatically identified clusters. Methods: We developed tools to visualise: (i) clusters found in dimensions of time, geographical location and genetic data; (ii) nested sub-clusters within identified clusters; (iii) intra-cluster pairwise dissimilarities per dimension; (iv) intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. We applied our tools to notified mumps cases in the Netherlands with available disease onset date (January 2009 -June 2016), geographical information (location of residence), and pathogen sequence data (n = 112). We compared identified clusters to clusters reported by the Netherlands Early Warning Committee (NEWC). Results: We identified five mumps clusters. Three clusters were considered plausible. One was questionable because, in phylogenetic analysis, genetic sequences related to it segregated in two groups. One was implausible with no smaller nested clusters, high intra-cluster dissimilarities on all dimensions, and low intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. The NEWC reports concurred with our findings: the plausible/questionable clusters corresponded to reported outbreaks; the implausible cluster did not. Conclusion: Our tools for assessing automatically identified clusters allow outbreak investigators to rapidly spot plausible transmission clusters for mumps and other human-to-human transmissible diseases. This fast information processing potentially reduces workload.",

With increasing availability of different types of data (e.g. geographical data, time, genetic sequence), each adding their own dimension, and quantities of data rising, transmissioncluster identification of infectious diseases progressively relies on automated algorithms. A transmission cluster can be defined as several cases of an infectious disease which are connected by transmission of this disease from one person to another. A transmission chain is then defined as a series of cases connected by transmission events. Much work has been done on developing algorithms to identify transmission clusters of cases using large datasets [1] . Existing algorithms focus on cluster identification in time [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , in space or space-time [10] [11] [12] , in genetics [13] [14] [15] , or by combining all three data dimensions [16] [17] [18] .",

If an algorithm lacks specificity, it finds clusters of cases even though there are no transmission events that link them. If it lacks sensitivity, the algorithm does not find genuine transmission chains. To be on the safe side, most algorithms have a high sensitivity at the expense of specificity and as a result also identify clusters of cases that are not genuine transmission clusters. We therefore propose cluster detection using algorithms as a two-step process: (i) detecting possible clusters of infectious diseases with an algorithm and (ii) assessing the plausibility that an identified cluster represents a transmission cluster.",

Currently, identified clusters are usually assessed by epidemiologists who assess information and verify it through communicating with the municipal health services (MHS). This can be quite labour intensive, especially if there are many identified clusters stretching across multiple regions. Only recently, a study has been published that introduced a framework for computing epidemiological concordance of microbial subtyping data of Campylobacter jejuni [19] . Epidemiological cluster cohesion is based on time, geographical location, and environmental source distances with adjustable weights. This method requires the computation of a disease specific source distance matrix, making it difficult to apply generically. To our knowledge no further tools are available for careful plausibility assessment of automatically detected clusters.",

We propose to assess the variation of clusters in their time, geographical location and genetic profile. The variation on these dimensions can be visualised by projecting cases on an epidemic curve, map, and phylogenetic tree, respectively, as well as by estimating the relative distance between clustered cases on these respective dimensions and comparing the distance to the inter-case distances from non-clustered cases. It is assumed that clustered cases will have smaller intercase distances on these respective dimensions than non-clustered cases. However, there are exceptions: an outbreak may show large variation in time between the occurrence of cases (single persistent source, e.g. typhoid [20] ), large variation in geographical distances between cases (initial cases travel large distances, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [21] ), or include large genetic sequence variation in the pathogen causing the outbreak (fast mutating strains, e.g. Ebola [22, 23] ). In order to settle several of these exceptions, intra-cluster correlation between the data dimensions time, geographical location and genetics can be used as another discriminatory characteristic. In genuine transmission clusters, variation on one dimension tends to be correlated with the other dimension. For example, with tuberculosis, cases within a genuine transmission cluster with a larger genetic distance, also tend to have a larger distance in time [24] .",

Moreover if data are available in a timely fashion, this may allow pointing outbreak investigators to the most plausible signals first, which, when time is scarce, may facilitate task prioritisation. Finally, outbreak information, such as what is obtained with various available tools (e.g. typical cluster size, typical inter-case distance and correlate estimates between dimensions for a specific disease), might contribute to our current understanding of transmission model parameters [26, 27] .",

In this study, we used more specifically the latitude and longitude of location of residence of the cases. In the Netherlands, cases' four digit postal code of residence is collected during routine surveillance. We take the centroids of the four digit postal codes and use its latitude and longitude as the input variables for the algorithm. The third required factor consists of the sequences of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene (316 bp), the haemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) gene (1,749 bp), and the fusion (F) gene (1,617 bp). Sequences of these three genes are used in combination to distinguish between different mumps genotypes [35] , and clusters within genotype G [33] .

The relative distances (dissimilarities) for each dimension are calculated, and the combined dissimilarity (d combi ) between every pair of cases is then defined as the product of the separate dimension dissimilarities. Next, the cases are joined to form a hierarchical tree of related cases, based on d combi , using single-linkage clustering.

A sequenced sample of the SH, HN, and F gene was available for 118 (5.8%) of the cases. Of the 118 cases with sequenced data, six had missing geographical data. Therefore, 112 (5.5%) cases were included in the analyses. These cases were mainly male (n = 65; 58.0%) and had a median age of 24 years (IQR: 20-27 years). In this study period, 14 mumps related signals were reported by the NEWC (Table 1) . Figures 1 to 4 represent output from our tool. The algorithm identifies 10 clusters with p < 0.001 of which five are nested (Figure 1 ). After collapsing the nested clusters into their parent clusters, five significant highest unnested clusters remain. Of those five highest unnested clusters clusters, cluster 2 (blue, n = 9), 3 (green, n = 12) and 4 (pink, n = 13) contain smaller clusters which are also significant, whereas cluster 1 (red, n = 3) and 5 (orange, n = 28) are not supported by other significant clusters at a lower nesting level.",

While cluster 4 is relatively concentrated in time and geographical location, it is distributed across two branches of the phylogenetic tree. For mumps this makes it less plausible that all cases belong to the same transmission chain, as the mumps virus is characterised by a very low mutation rate [39] . For each of the two clusters nested within cluster 4 in the hierarchical tree, cases are located on two branches of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that also the nested clusters contain substantial genetic disparity.

Only in cluster 3 the time dimension is significantly correlated with the geographical location (r = 0.4) and genetics (r = 0.5) data dimension, and in cluster 4 and 5 the time dimension is correlated with the genetics dimension only (r = 0.3 and r = 0.2 respectively). When then looking at the contribution of the individual data dimensions to the combined dimension, we can see that in cluster 1, 2 and 3, the dimension of time and geographical location contribute equally and strongly to the combined dimension (r = {0.9, 0.6, 0.9}), and in cluster 4 and 5 the dimension of genetics contributes the most information to the combined dimension (r = {0.8, 0.7}).

However, before 2013 the shapes of the epicurves differ: in the main analysis the large peaks in 2010, 2011 and 2012 cannot be observed. In 2013-16, we identify six clusters using only two dimensions that are similar to those identified using three dimensions, we miss only three minor clusters. In the period before 2013, nine additional clusters are identified in the time-place analysis, of which three are very large (n > 40). The lesser plausible pink (cluster 4) and orange (cluster 5) clusters from the main analysis fall in the less representative period before 2013, so it might be due to unrepresentative sequencing in this period that transmission cluster detection with this algorithm is more difficult.",

Compared with the other clusters, cluster 5 shows a relatively dispersed pattern across time, geographical location, and genetics; contains no nested clusters; shows relatively high intra-cluster dissimilarity on all dimensions; and shows the lowest intra-cluster correlation between all four dimensions.

Human vision supports fast processing of information [25] , allowing for quick decision-making and this can therefore facilitate work for outbreak investigators. Besides fast processing, visualisation also allows for disease-specific characteristics in the assessment of the plausibility. While the first step in cluster detection, which identifies possible transmission clusters, can be done by algorithms, as it is a very generic process, the second step needs diseasespecific considerations which cannot easily be incorporated in an algorithm. For example, in the case study our tools show that cluster 4 (pink) and cluster 5 (orange) span across multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree. A mumps expert knows that the mumps virus mutation rate is very low, which decreases the plausibility that these clusters represent unique transmission clusters.",

            "text": "An important aspect of our study is that only 5.5% of notified mumps cases had sufficient genetic information to be included. There are several reasons for this. First, mumps notification does not require laboratory confirmation in the Netherlands, but can also be based on the presence of an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. For these cases no material is available for testing and sequencing. Second, the obtained material is not always suitable for typing; viral loads can be low, which often result in failed sequencing. Third, we specifically chose to include only cases with an available sequenced sample of the SH, HN and F gene. Instead we could also have included cases with a sequenced sample of the SH gene only, as this would have resulted in a higher number of included cases. Nevertheless an earlier study [33] showed that the SH gene alone did not provide sufficient resolution for finding transmission clusters, whereas the combination of the three genes did. Since we aim to find transmission clusters here, including only sequenced samples of the SH gene was not an option. Because of these reasons, it is highly likely that the identified clusters in this study are actually larger or that some clusters are completely missed by the algorithm, as only one or two cases of a cluster might have a laboratory confirmation. This might explain the clusters reported by the NEWC (report 4, 7, 10 and 11), which were not identified by our tool (Table 1) .",

Complete data analysis is shown in the main text. Further work can focus on extending the algorithm to allow for missing data on one or more dimensions. Especially considering that genetics information will often be missing if sequences are not available, one could replace sequence information by a categorical variable with pathogen subtype or other lower resolution indication of the pathogen type. Cases with a similar pathogen (sub)type would then have a distance of zero vs a distance of > 0 to cases with another (sub)type. The (sub) type information, however, should still have sufficient resolution to be able to contribute to transmission cluster detection. Similarly, if geographical location information is not available on the latitude/longitude level, one can think of lower resolution solutions. In this study, we use the centroids of the four digit postal codes as geographical location information. The information should have sufficient resolution to be informative. The tool is not limited by the number or type of dimensions. The addition or reduction of dimensions only requires small adaptions in our code and it is therefore straightforward to use our tools in combination with other algorithms, for example, space-time algorithms [10] . By increasing or decreasing the number of dimensions in the algorithm, the relative weight of the included dimensions decreases or increases as well, respectively. Depending on the quality of the data from the additional or removed sources, this may not be desirable. We have specifically chosen not to put weights on the separate dimensions, as determining the size of the weights is a very arbitrary decision.",

Indeed, information on place of residence (geographical location) is of questionable accuracy as mumps mainly occur among students who often have more than one living address (near the university and their parents' address). It is then often not clear if the students actually live on the reported address at the time of the outbreak. On the other hand, if we would have had reliable geographical location information, other or more clusters might have been identified that now go undetected. Similarly, for mumps it is very unlikely that a transmission cluster is spread across multiple branches in the phylogenetic tree, so for mumps the genetic dimension might have more relevance than e.g. the geographical one. Instead of putting a weight on this dimension however, we considered cluster 4 and 5 as less plausible. Further work could investigate ways of determining the size of the weights, based either on the quality of the data (as discussed here) or on the type and transmission routes of the disease under investigation. A final issue regarding the internal correlation plots is that they are more useful when cluster sizes are larger. If the algorithm detects very small clusters (n < 4), we suggest to rely on the other tools to determine whether an identified cluster is plausible.",
