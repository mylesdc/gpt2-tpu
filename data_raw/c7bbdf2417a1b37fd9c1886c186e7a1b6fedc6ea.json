            "text": "Although the focus in the area of health research may be shifting from infectious to non-communicable diseases, the infectious diseases of poverty remain a major burden of disease of global health concern. A global platform to communicate and share the research on these diseases is needed to facilitate the translation of knowledge into effective approaches and tools for their elimination. Based on the \"One health, One world\" mission, a new, openaccess journal, Infectious Diseases of Poverty (IDP), was launched by BioMed Central in partnership with the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on October 25, 2012. Its aim is to identify and assess research and information gaps that hinder progress towards new interventions for a particular public health problem in the developing world. From the inaugural IDP issue of October 25, 2012, a total of 256 manuscripts have been published over the following five years. Apart from a small number of editorials, opinions, commentaries and letters to the editor, the predominant types of publications are research articles (69.5%) and scoping reviews (21.5%). A total of 1 081 contributing authors divided between 323 affiliations across 68 countries, territories and regions produced these 256 publications. The journal is indexed in major international biomedical databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. In 2015, it was assigned its first impact factor (4.11), which is now 2.13. During the past five years, IDP has received manuscripts from 90 countries, territories and regions across six continents with an annual acceptance rate of all contributions maintained at less than 40%. Content analysis shows that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), followed by the \"Big Three\" (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) and infectious diseases in general comprise 88% of all publications. In addition, a series of 10 thematic issues, covering 118 publications in all, was published as separate parts of the first five volumes. These publications were cited 975 times, which equals an average of 8.3 times per publication. The current challenge is to identify cutting-edge research topics and attract and to publish first-rate publications leading to increasing importance and impact of the journal in its field.",

Table 4 presents the 10 most highly cited publications, which includes five reviews, two editorials, one opinion article, one research article and one letter to the editor. Interestingly, the most highly cited publication in IDP is an editorial published in 2013 [25] , which may be explained by the fact that it dealt with surveillance and response defining this approach as a research priority during the stage moving towards elimination of tropical diseases, which received much global attention [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The importance and significance of the surveillance and response approach are also highlighted by two other highly cited publications in IDP [26, 31] . We refer here to two reviews, one discussing gap analysis of the Chinese three major tropical diseases (schistosomiasis, malaria and echinococcosis), and the other assessing the morbidity due to schistosomiasis japonica in China [32, 33] . In addition, an editorial opinion focusing on the Chinese schistosomiasis control and health systems and a research article reporting on Babesia microti and Plasmodium co-infections along the China-Myanmar border were also commonly cited [34, 35] . Among three other publications, which have been cited 26 times and more, are two reviews describing global epidemiology: the burden of infectious diseases of poverty [2] and that of clonorchiasis [36] , together with an editorial introducing the mission, aims and scope of IDP [37] .

Two reviews, one on tuberculosis [40] and the other on malaria and other vector-borne protozoan diseases [41] were also often downloaded. Interestingly, the most highly accessed publication is a research article exploring the potential correlation between the emergence of infectious diseases and global climate change, perhaps explained by the currently worldwide focus on a large number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in this context [42, 43] .",

In its first five volumes, the journal published studies from 53 developing economies (34%) and attracted contributions from 61 developing economies (39%); however, there are still more than 60% of the global developing economies that have not yet contributed a paper to the journal. Further work to attract manuscripts from the developing world is urgently needed. In addition, 31% (284/917) of all manuscripts in the first five years were submitted by African scientists; however, even if only slightly more than 33% (95/284) of these were finally published, this indicates a strong African interest in publishing with IDP as well as a trend of improving quality of research conducted in Africa.",

Publication of 'hot' research topics and results changing the direction of research should be strived for and this can be achieved through invited manuscripts and thematic series. In the future, work attracting high-quality papers from Europe and USA in addition to papers from the developing world, should be strengthened.",

Publication of thematic series pertaining to global 'hot' topics in public health, emerging or re-emerging diseases and the outcome of international major projects on infectious diseases; Finally, the question of a paper's true value must be mentioned as it is at the heart of the collaboration between author(s) and journal. That question extends naturally to the question of what the true value of a scientific journal is. This question has been approached in various ways, not the least by awarding impact factors. This first attempt is still the most utilized metric for assessing a journal's merit, but new developments are telling us that a faster and wider range of researchrelated metrics are needed. The number of clicks, downloads and reads are already providing valuable insights into how published content is being used and shared by fellow scientists. A multitude of commercial companies are already active in this field, for example, Altmetric (https://www.altmetric.com/), Plum Analytics (http:// plumanalytics.com/) and ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/). Meta (http://www.meta.com) has gone one step further by using algorithms recognizing the unique features characterizing widely cited papers, and the company claims that this can predict a paper's future impact before its publication. More than 26 million papers and 14 million researchers have already been profiled by the company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Meta) to support this claim.",

However, there is still a long way to go to further advance research and evidence-building based on improved public health interventions in poor settings. It is believed that IDP can significantly facilitate progress towards the elimination of infectious diseases related to poverty. In this process, IDP will not only be judged by the quality of the articles published, but also regarding how it fits into the new world of merit assessment. ",
