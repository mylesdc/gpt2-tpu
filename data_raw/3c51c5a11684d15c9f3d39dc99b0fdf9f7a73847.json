We propose to address the challenge of providing health care both internationally and domestically using a model of networked health care called Cybercare [3] , originally derived from the expression \"Health care in Cyberspace.\" This model shifts health care from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Moving health care provision from a central, hospital-based model to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, and increase patient and provider satisfaction. Cybercare employs technology to deliver services efficiently across a distributed networkfor example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors, and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using IT to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven \"pillars\" of technology to transform medical care delivery: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; AI; the EMR; and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network.",

Section 1 discusses current Fig. 1 How Cybercare will make the health care system evolve over time. 1 . In 2000, the bulk of health care was centered in large hospitals, to which patients were transported often over long distances and at large expense. 2. In 2015, health care has been distributed away from central hospitals, with more care provided in community clinics and at home through telemedicine and wearable sensors. The network helps to integrate the functions of private and public health care and national security (the healthcare network also functions in disasters or acts of war) 3. In 2030, Cybercare will have enabled the bulk of care provision to happen at home, with only \"super hospitals\" remaining for very specialized services. The functions of private and public health care and national security almost completely overlap demographic and epidemiologic trends that challenge the practice of medicine worldwide, today. Section 2 describes how Cybercare could solve these current problems and develop to meet the medical needs of the world we envision in 2030.",

Maternal and childhood illness remain major public health threats in the developing world. In the first world, aging populations suffer a burden of chronic non-communicable illnesses, such as vascular disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. Aside from the global burden of disease, US health care is still too expensive for many patients; physicians are pressed to increase revenue while hospitals and medical centers profit from people's illness; insurance is a headache for patients, lawmakers and doctors, with no clear winners except insurance companies; and the focus of care remains on treatment rather than prevention. The current healthcare system, based on care provision at central, expensive hospitals, is not financially efficient, practical for providers, or accessible to all patients. Efforts to fix the \"broken\" system have involved cutting costs and services, limiting clinicians' ability to practice, or giving patients too much or too little care, without attention to outcomes.",

This excellent system helps us plan how medical resources should be allocated to combat disease. The GBD study classifies worldwide disease into noncommunicable disease and communicable disease. At present, non-communicable diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) are overtaking communicable diseases (such as influenza, Ebola, HIV, etc.) in numbers and costs. Furthermore, the prevalence of diseases associated with famine and malnutrition is now being surpassed by the incidence of diseases associated with being overweight. It is astounding that more people now die from obesity rather than starvation (Maureen Quigley, personal communication). These epidemiological trends correlate with demographic shifts to increase the burden of disease.",

Perhaps the greatest failure of the GBD report is its ignorance of the evolutionary capacity of pathogens to adapt. Pathogens are not static; they exhibit rapid evolution in response to environmental conditions. As Price-Smith has argued, pathogens are constantly evolving to exploit novel ecological conditions that arise from new ecosystems, and many of these pathogens have arisen under conditions of relative prosperity. As such, these \"plagues of affluence\" now afflict people throughout the developed world, radiating throughout the new sanitized environments of technologically sophisticated ecosystems including hospitals and office environments [23] . Examples of pathogens that thrive in these new sanitary ecologies are Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), etc. Thus, the GBD study, which held that infectious diseases would simply be eradicated, did not account for the genetic mutability of pathogens; their ability to colonize novel ecological niches within sanitized societies; or how much they impact health and healthcare cost.",

For more than 40 years researchers have written about applying computer technologies to improve medical care. During this period, government and private agencies have collected and organized vast quantities of scientific data that relate to our health. Many illnesses and injuries are directly caused or significantly influenced by our food, air, water, medications, and environment. This section of the paper will describe and show examples of how information technology, when applied to health care and public health, may help avoid or delay disease, foster prevention and wellness, improve quality of life, minimize healthcare expenses, and predict future epidemics or healthcare crises. The current healthcare system, in the US and most of the world, is still based on a 20th century model in which patients travel, often long distances, to centralized hospitals and pay a high price for treatment. This outdated model concentrates physical resources in centralized hospitals for the convenience and efficiency of healthcare providers. For patients, this design creates access challenges and encourages detrimental cross-pollination like hospital-acquired infections or medication mix-ups. It also produces a system with large critical nodes that are vulnerable (see Fig. 1 ). For instance, a natural disaster or a terrorist event could take down a hospital along with its providers, causing all patients to forfeit care. This happened in Toronto, Canada, in 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. De-centralizing hospitals and moving more sophisticated care into the community and home with Cybercare makes patients better able to access and dictate care, and makes the system more robust during normal operations and when under threat.",

Simulation technology combined with telemedicine empowers the generalist to provide care at the level of the specialist. EMRs, cell phones, and sensors empower the patient provider to care for him-or herself with the help of a nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or family member in their home or local clinic. Artificial intelligence can be designed into laboratory tests that tell the doctor when the test is complete, through the use of intelligent agents assigned to a laboratory test or imaging study. Smart robots exist that could help the patient conduct or interpret lab tests and other tasks in the home [24] , and many more are in development. Emphasis is placed on the prevention of disease and living a healthy lifestyle. The network provides information and tracking that enables better prediction of disease pandemics, so that clinicians can intervene earlier. Patients can be treated remotely during disasters, when they are mobile, or traveling. This new web of care replaces the present system of centralized hospitals that is inefficient, expensive, and forces the patient to travel rather than receiving care in their location.",

Many fewer hospitals will be required, and those remaining will run in a cost-effective and efficient manner (see Fig. 1 ). Like factories, hospitals will be run 24/7 as a limited, expensive resource. This is already happening as radiology runs magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) machines on two or three shifts, the emergency room runs 24 / 7, and some hospital clinics such as dermatology and pediatrics are open nights and weekends.

The family members will also take on an expanded role in the care of the patient. This would be known as the patient provider model of care. Previously, health care was dominated by the patient-provider relationship wherein the patient passively looked to a provider for direction regarding his or her health.

Until recently, genomic sequencing was limited to a rather specific patient Fig. 4 Venn Diagram. Cybercare will help the provider to view all data from a patient's physical, behavioral and genomic traits, through the integration of the Internet and its information technology tools population, as the cost far outweighed the benefits for most patients. That has now changed with Illumina claiming to have the ability to sequence the genome for $1000 and the overall decrease in cost seen since the early 2000s [30, 31] . Due to the falling cost of sequencing and the proliferation of direct-toconsumer tests, such as 23andme.com and ancestry.com, we predict a greater shift towards genomic-based medicine. In order for the patient provider to adequately utilize this information they will need to track their day-to-day activities using wearable technology.

Making health care digital and interoperable rapidly made distance irrelevant to practice. The act is currently in its second iteration of requirements and in 2015 is challenged to demonstrate improved outcomes [33] . The US Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 offers hope for near universal coverage and the emphasis on patient rights, access, affordability, and a coherent funding plan has seen millions of new insurance beneficiaries [34] . If the HITECH initiative made the EMR a prime tool for telemedicine, the ACA created a surge in demand for health care that exceeds capacity. The American Association of Medical Colleges predicts that by 2025, the US will have a shortfall of 25,000 to 50,000 physicians [29] . A shortfall of surgeons is also predicted by the Lancet 2030 article [35] . Task shifting can help to reduce this shortage of physicians by utilizing simulation and augmented reality technologies under Cybercare. The situation in nursing is even more dire. Instead of relying on nurses, a patient's family members, with proper training, could provide the necessary care. That implies no change in the established, long-revered practice pattern (called incident care) whereby a patient recognizes a problem, seeks a medical encounter, gets examined, and treated. Unfortunately we cannot staff medicine in the same way for what now is needed: the long-term management of chronic disease in an aging population.

For example, a dermatologist at a remote site can view a video of the patient's skin and talk to the primary care provider and patient about it on live video. Specialty clinics in dermatology can run a full schedule of consults by store-and-forward technology and direct patient interviews to manage difficult problems with accuracy and unprecedented access.

Absenteeism of students from both private and public schools is then added into this plot to confirm that something (perhaps an outbreak of flu) is happening and where. It is important to note that in this case of syndromic surveillance, none of this data exists in the hospital or an emergency room since most people don't go to either place when they only have initial symptoms.

Anyone who has seen an actual reconstruction of a Greek Trireme with a crew of 200 under sail knows what a powerful visual representation of Cybernetics Weiner was trying to evoke. So too are we trying to use another military analogy to provide our peers with an understanding of \"Cybercare\" in action with the concept of a \"Virtual Valley Forge Hospital.\" Valley Forge General Hospital was opened around the time that Weiner first wrote about Cybernetics. It was a military hospital constructed during World War II, but operated under a uniquely modern model of how health care should be synchronized. Valley Forge was a super hospital that provided the highest level of care possible (tertiary care and above), including specialized plastic surgery, eye surgery, and other specialties for the entire nation. Valley Forge surgeons conceived of procedures never before performed, like transplants of tissues which were performed 10 years later (the first kidney transplant by Joe Murray).",

The Lancet Commission has forecasted a global shortage of surgeons in 2030 [35] unless we begin to shift our policy. This potential shortage can be addressed with task shifting and Cybercare technologies through simulation, teleconsultation, telerobotics, and telementoring using augmented reality.",

As Cybercare evolves, the functions of private health care, public health care, and security will become more integrated. We need a dual-use system that can respond equally to communicable and non-communicable disease, and also to trauma, including acts of terror and war. Just as Eisenhower built the US national highway system, a massive and expensive project, by federal mandatewe see Cybercare II as a national healthcare security system that needs to be funded and put into place as soon as possible to protect us from communicable disease, non-communicable disease, trauma, and war. Similar to the US national highway system, Cybercare would be a dual-use system, capable of responding to daily concerns, and if needed to respond to crises whether natural or man-made. Other governments could join and follow with mandates of their own. This would allow us to sustain our societal goals of freedom and the healthy pursuit of happiness. Health is a cornerstone of our way of life.",
