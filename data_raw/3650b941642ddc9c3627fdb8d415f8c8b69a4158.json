We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318-510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS patient for antibodies complementary to CR3014. A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3. No escape variants could be generated with CR3022. The mixture of both mAbs showed neutralization of SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. Dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 were observed for CR3014 and CR3022, respectively, at 100% neutralization. Because enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by subneutralizing antibody concentrations is of concern, we show here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that spread in 2003 and 2004 from the Guangdong province of southern China to 32 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America, resulting in over 8,000 cases and 774 deaths [1, 2] . The main epidemic was stopped in late 2003 through internationally coordinated public health measures including early isolation of SARS patients and quarantine of contacts, at considerable economic costs to the affected countries [3] [4] [5] . In 2003 and 2004 a number of isolated SARS cases occurred again in China and other Asian countries; some of these cases were linked to laboratory or unknown exposure, but others were community acquired and associated with exposure to the live game animal restaurant trade in Guangdong province [6, 7] . SARS-CoV-like viruses almost identical to a patient's isolate were found in palm civet cats investigated during the same period [7] . Phylogenetic analysis of approximately 100 SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civet cats collected from 2002 to 2004 revealed that SARS is a zoonotic disease that is evolving in palm civet and human hosts [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, presumably asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses has repeatedly occurred in wild animal handlers in Guangdong province several years before the SARS epidemic [9] . Recently, bats have been identified as an important natural reservoir of the virus [10] . It is therefore unlikely that the mass culling of civets cats performed in southern China is sufficient to prevent further spillover of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like viruses to the human population.",

The virus-mAb mixture was incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 , then the virus was removed and the cells were washed twice with medium. Finally, cells were incubated for 2 d in the presence of the above concentrations of mAb in 0.5 ml of medium. Supernatant of cells incubated with highest virus dilution showing CPE, containing the potential escape viruses, was harvested and stored at 4 8C until further use. Virus samples were freeze-thawed once, serial dilutions were prepared in medium and added to wells containing FRhK-4 cells, and the dilutions incubated for 1 h at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 in the presence of mAb. Wells were then overlaid with agarose containing mAbs at the above concentration and incubated for 3-5 d at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 . Individual escape virus plaques were picked using a Pasteur pipette and freezethawed once, and the escape viruses were amplified on FRhK-4 cells. To identify possible mutations in the SARS-CoV spike protein of each of the escape viruses, the nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV S open reading frame (ORF) was determined. Viral RNA of each of the escape viruses and wild-type SARS-CoV virus was isolated and converted into cDNA by standard RT-PCR. Subsequently, the cDNA was used for nucleotide sequencing of the SARS-CoV S ORF in order to identify mutations. Secondly, the neutralization index was determined for each of the escape viruses. Therefore, each escape virus and wild-type SARS-CoV (100 TCID 50 ) was incubated for 1 h at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 with mAb at the above concentration before addition to FRhK-4 cells. The virus was allowed to attach to the cells for 1 h at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 , after which the inoculum was removed and cells were washed twice with medium before being replenished with medium containing mAb. After a 2 d incubation at 37 8C and 5% CO 2 the medium was harvested and the TCID 50 /ml of each virus was determined. The neutralization index was determined by subtracting the number of infectious virus particles (expressed as log TCID 50 /ml) produced in FRhK-4 cell cultures infected with virus in the presence of mAb from the number of infectious virus particles (log TCID 50 /ml) produced in FRhK-4 cell cultures infected with virus alone.

To investigate the effect of subneutralizing doses of anti-SARS Abs on viral infection in macrophages, 300 ll of serially diluted mAb in MM medium, convalescent serum from a SARS-CoV exposed individual, or serum from a healthy individual was mixed with 300 ll of SARS-CoV. MM medium mixed with SARS-CoV served as the virus control. The virus/mAb mixtures and virus/serum mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 8C. Then, 250 ll of the mixtures was added to duplicate wells containing macrophages. After 1 h of virus adsorption at 37 8C, the virus inoculum was removed, infected cells were washed with macrophage SFM culture medium and incubated in macrophage SFM medium supplemented with 0.6 lg/ml penicillin and 60 lg/ml streptomycin. Samples of the culture supernatants were collected at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 postinfection and stored at \u00c070 8C for virus titration experiments. SARS-CoV was titrated and the TCID 50 determined essentially as described. RNA was isolated from infected macrophages at 6 and 24 hours postinfection using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of positiveand negative-strand viral RNA was performed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR targeting the ORF1b gene, as described previously [31] . The SARS-CoV RNA levels were normalized for the levels of b-actin mRNA.",

In the presence of 2.8 3 10 \u00c05 to 2.8 3 10 \u00c03 lg/ml of CR3014 a slight increase in virus uptake into macrophages is suggested by the increased copy number of positive-strand RNA ( Figure 5 ).

Progress has also been made in understanding the target of the neutralizing immune response through immunization with whole killed SARS-CoV and recombinant vectors expressing the S glycoprotein and other structural proteins [11] [12] [13] . Neutralizing antibodies seem to be predominantly directed against a domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein, defined by amino acids 318-510, which is responsible for interaction of the virus with its cellular receptor ACE2 [34] [35] [36] [37] . Mapping of this RBD using a panel of mouse mAbs has led to the identification of six distinct neutralizing epitopes, which are all conformationdependent [38] .

The use of convalescent serum in SARS patients was reported to be associated with possible benefit and in any event was not associated with adverse effects [14, 16] . In consequence, commercial production of SARS antiserum from human donors has been initiated in China [39] . Passive transfer of immune serum generated through immunization of animals with whole killed virus or vector-expressed full-length S or S fragments has reduced viral replication in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection [11, 18] . Human mAbs have been generated through phage display, immortalization of human B-cells from SARSpatients, or immunization of transgenic mice, and were shown to display protective efficacy in the mouse model [17, 19, 20] . In addition, the human mAb CR3014 reduced SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected ferrets, completely prevented the development of lung lesions, and abolished viral shedding in the pharyngeal secretions of the animals [21] . Because SARS-CoV is spread by the respiratory and the fecal-oral route, the observation that passive immunization is successful in controlling outbreaks of hepatitis A virus and protecting against varicella-zoster and respiratory syncytial virus infection argues for the feasibility of an emergency immune prophylaxis during a SARS outbreak [23, 24, 40] .",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibody prophylaxis against SARS must meet certain criteria to be effective. The breadth of protection of a single mAb may not be sufficient to protect against all clinically relevant strains of the virus, and it has been suggested that genotyping of SARS-CoV in case of a new outbreak may be required to select for optimally neutralizing mAbs [19] . A comprehensive analysis of the variability of approximately 100 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV isolates obtained from human patients and civet cats between 2002 and 2004 revealed that the S glycoprotein, especially the RBD, is under strong positive selective pressure during the transition from animal-to-animal to human-to-human transmission, because of differences in the ACE2 receptors of civet cats and humans [7] . The highest variability of the RBD is observed within the group of SARS-CoV-like viruses isolated from animals, with no data as yet available concerning the receptor specificity of the newly discovered bat-CoV [10] . Interestingly, patients infected with SARS-CoV-like viruses had a milder course of disease and did not transmit the viruses to other persons, presumably because of insufficient adaptation of the civet cat virus RBD to human ACE2, which is required for productive infection of human cell lines [19, 41, 42] . The RBD of SARS-CoV isolates from the next SARS epidemic will therefore likely be very similar to the isolates from 2003. The RBD of human SARS-CoV isolates is highly conserved and alignment of 114 sequences published in GenBank revealed only eight different S sequences not identical to the FM1 strain [22] . Of all human isolates SARS-CoV-like isolate GD03T0013, which was obtained from a patient in 2003, shows the highest RBD divergence and closest relatedness to civet cat strains [7] . Human mAb CR3014 binds well to recombinantly expressed RBDs representing seven of the RBD variants, including GD03T0013, but less to a variant with a N479S mutation found in human isolate BJ302 cl.2, and not at all to an RBD derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like isolate SZ3. Antibody CR3022, derived by phage display from a convalescent SARS patient, binds well to the latter two variants in addition to the others. A combination of CR3014 and CR3022 may therefore offer sufficient protection not only against SARS-CoV strains but also against SARS-CoVlike viruses originating from civet cats. Viral replication in the presence of a mAb, especially at subneutralizing concentrations, carries the risk of selecting neutralization escape variants. We therefore analyzed escape variants of SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 generated under selective pressure of CR3014 or CR3022, which was unsuccessful for the latter. All CR3014 escape variants had the same single amino acid exchange in the RBD (P462L), which has not been reported in any SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like virus to date. This variant was successfully neutralized with CR3022, extending the breadth of protection of this antibody combination from naturally occurring variants also to possible CR3014 immune escapes. A similar strategy was previously pursued to develop a mAb product for postexposure prophylaxis of rabies [43] . Because neutralization escape in vitro may not accurately reflect the in vivo situation, the CR3014/CR3022 combination needs to be tested at subneutralizing concentrations in animal models of SARS-CoV infection.",

Synergism of neutralizing mAbs has not yet been reported for SARS-CoV, but was observed for combinations of two, three, or four mAbs directed against different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, leading to a two-to ten-fold increase of neutralization titers [30, 44, 45] . Mechanistically, cooperative binding of mAbs may induce conformational changes in the antigen thereby altering affinities (allosteric effect), lead to intermolecular interaction of bivalent antibodies, or result in interaction of the Fc regions of antibodies brought into close contact [46] . As determined by ELISA, CR3014 and CR3022 bind simultaneously to the RBD of the S1 subunit of the glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV. However, measuring separate, sequential, and simultaneous binding of the mAbs in Biacore did not reveal enhanced affinity of the antibody mixture over the individual affinities, especially for CR3022. Another possible explanation for synergism could be increased breadth of protection against different quasispecies of a viral isolate [30] . Heterogeneous sequences have been detected through direct sequencing of SARS-CoV RNA recovered from single patient samples, and adaptive mutations induced by repeated cell culture passage have been reported [47] [48] [49] . It should therefore be formally investigated whether SARS-CoV quasispecies formation in cell culture may influence the outcome of virus neutralization assays. Lastly, CR3022 could interfere with binding of the S1 subunit to a known or unknown coreceptor of the virus [50] . The mechanism by which the two mAbs neutralize SARS-CoV synergistically therefore remains presently elusive.",

This antibody dose compares well with the required dosage of Palivizumab (15 mg/kg), which protects at-risk infants from infection with respiratory syncytial virus and is currently the only licensed antiviral monoclonal antibody [40] . However, the required amount of CR3014 for protecting a standard 70 kg adult is relatively high, and it would be desirable to use a lower dose for economic reasons. Furthermore, the even lower potency of CR3022 precludes its use as a stand-alone prophylaxis. Therefore, the observed four-to twenty-fold dose reduction of the individual mAbs in the CR3014/CR3022 mixture may hold an attractive option to reduce the total antibody dose required for neutralizing the virus in vivo while at the same time expanding the breadth of protection.",

Both immunization and passive transfer of antibody was shown to mediate this phenomenon and mAbs have been used to map neutralizing and enhancing epitopes on the spike glycoprotein of feline infectious peritonitis virus [25, 51] . There is no direct evidence of ADE linked to SARS-CoV infection in humans to date, and infection of human macrophages with SARS-CoV was previously shown to be abortive [25] . However, it was recently shown, in a viral pseudotype assay expressing the full-length spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoVlike viruses, that these cannot be neutralized with either homologous or heterologous mouse immune sera, and that both the sera and human mAbs neutralizing SARS-CoV enhance infectivity of the pseudotype for the human adenocarcinoma cells used as indicator system [34] . Given that ADE in feline infectious peritonitis virus infection is mediated by increased macrophage uptake of virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody, we performed human macrophage infectivity assays in the presence of CR3014 and human convalescent serum. In this type of assay, ADE of Dengue and Ross River virus infection has previously been demonstrated [52] . The addition of varying concentrations of CR3014 or convalescent SARS serum to SARS CoV did not convert the abortive infection into a productive one, reducing the likelihood that ADE will be observed in vivo after passive immunization.",

            "text": "Why Was This Study Done? The first epidemic of SARS was caused by an animal virus that became adapted to spread between people. There is no reason this process won't be repeated. If it is, stringent quarantine measures could again prevent a global epidemic, but at considerable economic cost. What is needed is a way to prevent SARS developing in healthy people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV and to treat sick people so that they are less infectious and can fight the virus. In this study, researchers have been investigating ''passive immunization'' as a way to limit SARS epidemics. In passive immunization, short-term protection against illness is achieved by injecting antibodies-proteins that recognize specific molecules (called antigens) on foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses and prevent those organisms from causing disease. Antibodies for passive immunization can be isolated from blood taken from people who have had SARS, or they can be manufactured as so-called ''human monoclonal antibodies'' in a laboratory. One of these human monoclonal antibodies-CR3014-had been previously made and shown to prevent lung damage in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV and to stop the infected animals from infecting others. But for effective disease prevention in people, a single monoclonal antibody might not be enough. There are strains of SARS-CoV that CR3014 does not recognize and therefore cannot act against. Also, the virus can alter the antigen recognized by CR3014 when it is grown at a low antibody concentration, producing so-called escape variants; if this happens CR3014 can no longer prevent these escape variants from killing human cells.",

            "text": "What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers tested how well a combination of two monoclonal antibodies controlled SARS-CoV killing of human cells. First, they showed that CR3014 escape variants all had the same small change in a part of the virus surface that interacts with human cells. CR3014 blocked this interaction in the parent SARS-CoV strain but not in the escape variants. They then made a new monoclonal antibody-CR3022-that prevented both the parent SARS-CoV stain and the CR3014 escape viruses from killing human cells. The two antibodies bound to neighboring parts of the virus surface, and both of them could bind at the same time. CR3022 also bound to surfaces of SARS-CoV strains to which CR3014 does not bind. And when they tried, the researchers could not generate any viral escape variants to which CR3022 was unable to bind. Finally, the effect of the two antibodies together on inhibition of SARS-CoV killing of human cells was more than the sum of their individual effects.",

            "text": "What Do These Findings Mean? A combination of two (or more) human monoclonal antibodies that recognize different parts of the SARS-CoV surface that interacts with human cells might be a good way to immunize people passively against SARS-CoV. It might minimize the possibility of escape variants arising, broaden the range of virus strains against which protection is provided, and reduce the amount of antibody needed for effective protection. Before the approach is tried in people, it will have to be tested in animals-results from experiments done on human cells in dishes are not always replicated in whole animals or people. If the approach passes further tests, the hope is that passive immunization of people with SARS and their close contacts might reduce disease severity in infected people and reduce viral spread as effectively as dramatic quarantine measures Additional Information.
