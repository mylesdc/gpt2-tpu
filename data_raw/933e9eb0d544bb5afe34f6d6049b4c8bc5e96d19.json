In a study conducted by the Epidemiologic Reference Institute (InDRE) of Mexico, 11% of the samples collected from different regions of the country between 1995 and 2000 were positive for viruses [7] . In hospitalized children, a respiratory virus was detected in 47% of patients with lower respiratory tract infections in a large referral Hospital in San Luis Potosi [8] , and in 14% in the Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez [9] . In other studies carried out in the community setting, up to 65% of viral detection has been described [10] [11] [12] , and the detection rate in secondary care hospitals has been reported to be between 39 and 60% [8, 11, 13] .",

In contrast, a recent report from Switzerland using molecular tests, described picornavirus as the most prevalent virus in upper respiratory tract infections in children (48%), followed by AdV (16%) and RSV (14%), although the population included in this study was different from those carried out in Mexico since it was performed in children hospitalized in a tertiary care center [15] . In another study carried out in Mexico in children younger than 18 years of age with influenzalike illness, influenza was the most frequent virus found (16.7%), followed by RSV (13.2%) and RV (11.2%) [16] . In this work HMPV was not detected as frequently as in Yucat\u00e1n, in a study carried out in children with influenza-like illness, where 20% of the samples were positive for this virus [17] . Also, 10.5% of children hospitalized in San Luis Potos\u00ed, which had been negative for other respiratory viruses, were reported to be positive for HMPV [12] . In our study HMPV was found in 5.3% of the tested samples.",

Detection of several viruses in a single sample is frequently reported in respiratory infections in which a PCR-based diagnostic method is used, however, the clinical relevance of detection of more than one virus is uncertain [18] [19] [20] [21] . In this study, however, a tendency of correlation between coinfections and the severity of disease was observed. In children with laryngotracheitis and bronchiolitis, viral coinfection was detected in 28 and 18% respectively, compared to 13.8 and 10.5% of rhinopharyngitis and pharyngitis, respectively. This suggests that a viral coinfection could predispose to a more severe disease, although the low number of children in this study with more severe disease limits this conclusion. In addition, whether the detection of virus in nasal swabs reflects the actual pathogen of the clinical disease or reflects only nasopharyngeal carriage or an asymptomatic infection is not known, particularly when highly sensitive molecular methods are employed [22] .",
