This sensing platform relies on graphene oxide (GO) surfaces conjugated with anti-human tau antibody to provide quantitative binding sites for the tau protein. The GO quenches standard fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled tau (tau-FITC) when tau protein and tau-FITC are both present and compete for the binding sites. This change in fluorescence signal can be used to quantitate tau protein.",

Tau protein plays a very important role in the onset of AD-abnormally aggregated tau protein oligomers and paired helical filaments (PHFs) are major elements that confer cellular toxicity [5] [6] [7] [8] .

In these previous works, GO acted as a fluorescence quencher based on the photo-induced electron transfer mechanism or electronic energy transfer mechanism without further modification. The biomolecules were attached on a GO surface through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrophobic interactions but had no specificity, i.e. any protein that had an aromatic ring could be adsorbed by GO. The surface modification of GO by antibodies could provide better specificity through antibody-antigen reactions, but this has rarely been reported.",

            "text": "We recently reported [30] a GO-based biosensor suitable for detecting proteins. We validated this approach with a generic IgG analyte. We showed that the immune reaction had specificity and that energy transfer on the antibody-conjugated GO surface could be used to quantify IgG. Here, we extend this sensing approach to tau protein sensing and demonstrate that the performance metrics are compatible with clinical needs for the diagnosis of AD. Here, the antibody-conjugated GO surface can specifically bind with both regular tau protein (analyte) and fluorescent tau-FITC (standard). Thus, it exhibits competitive binding of the two types of tau proteins. The amount of analyte tau protein controls the adsorption of tau-FITC, and hence the degree of its fluorescence quenching by GO. This change in fluorescence signal is used to measure tau in the samples via a calibration curve. In clinical practice, human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples are usually tested to measure tau concentrations. According to the literature [9, 10] , baseline tau protein in human CSF is usually 0-100 pg ml \u22121 . This increases to hundreds or even thousands of pg ml \u22121 in disease (Oka et al. [31] reported values as high as 6.3 ng ml \u22121 ) which is close to the limit of detection (LOD) achieved in this study (6.4 ng ml \u22121 ). Figure 1a shows that the tau-FITC is adsorbed strongly and is quenched when there is no tau analyte in the solution. When tau is present and competes for the available binding sites, fewer tau-FITC are adsorbed on the remaining sites. They remain free in solution, and this increases the fluorescence signal (figure 1b). Thus, the fluorescence intensity increases with increasing tau. Next, we briefly outline the experimental methods and then present details followed by discussion and concluding remarks.",

This surface provides antibody-mediated specific binding sites, which are superior to other types of surfaces that rely on physical adsorption. The analyte tau441 proteins (i.e. the longest isoform of human tau protein [4] , abbreviated as analyte tau below. This isoform is more representative than others because it contains all microtubule-associated groups related to the formation of PHFs [6] . It was added at increasing concentrations to buffer solutions containing antibody-conjugated GO. After adsorption of analyte tau proteins on some of the binding sites, FITClabelled tau441 (abbreviated as tau-FITC) was also added. The GO surface is not only a nano-scale binding platform, but is also an energy acceptor [32] [33] [34] [35] that quenches the fluorescence of tau-FITC. Because quenching occurs in close proximity, only the tau-FITC adsorbed on the antibody-conjugated GO became quenched [36] [37] [38] [39] . As the number density of binding sites was limited to the modified GO, more adsorbed tau analyte resulted in stronger fluorescence signal from free tau-FITC in the solutions. Essentially, the analyte tau proteins control the fluorescence quenching and determine the fluorescence intensity. ",

Thus, more free tau-FITC will remain in solution and will produce more fluorescence. Therefore, there is a positive and quantitative correlation between analyte tau concentration and the fluorescence intensity of free tau-FITC. The assay relies on the effectiveness of GO as an energy acceptor to provide efficient fluorescence quenching. The modification of the GO surface may change the molecular orbitals of GO and affect quenching efficiency [40] ; i.e. the change in GO's quenching efficiency was determined empirically.

These three types of GO were added to standard samples containing 100 ng ml \u22121 of tau-FITC. As expected, the fluorescence of tau-FITC should decrease when tau-FITC binds to the GO surfaces. Figure 3a shows a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity with increasing amounts of bare GO. This then exhibits a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of GO. The signal change versus GO concentration is plotted in figure 3d . The transfer of energy from the excited FITC to bare GO is actually much easier than that to antibody-conjugated GO because the modification of GO with antibodies changed the electronic properties of GO turning GO into a semiconductor [40] . This implies that the quenching efficiency of antibody-conjugated GO might be lower than bare GO.",

With 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of antibody-conjugated GO, about 30% of the tau-FITC initial fluorescence was quenched (figure 3d). Therefore, with analyte tau in solution, the fluorescence-intensity change in tau-FITC is between 0 and 30% with respect to initial fluorescence with no analyte. In addition, there was a fluorescence peak near 605 nm (figure 3b,c). This could not be seen in figure 3a. The fluorescence peak at 605 nm was due to scattering caused by antibodyconjugated GO as we suspected. The thickness of the antibody-conjugated GO was much larger than bare GO as shown by AFM. This affected the optical properties of the analyte solution and resulted in a scattering peak at 605 nm. One final assay characterization step was to determine if the diminishing fluorescence intensity could originate from other sources. This assay would be useless if the fluorescence of tau-FITC was quenched regardless of its free/bound state. By blocking the GO surface with 2% BSA in buffer, we found that the fluorescence intensity of tau-FITC remains nearly constant with increasing amounts of BSA-blocked GO as clearly shown in figures 3c,d. This confirms that free tau-FITC in solution would not be quenched by the presence of large concentrations (up to 400 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) of inactive GO. Only the tau-FITC adsorbed on the surface of GO could be quenched.",

To make the results directly proportional to analyte concentration, we use the change in intensity ( I) instead of I. Figure 4a shows an assay response curve prepared by this approach. The value of I was calculated by subtracting the final fluorescence intensity at 520 nm and the 'blank' sample without analyte tau. Figure 4a shows that the fluorescence signal increased readily with increasing analyte tau concentrations.

The LOD of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method is better than our work (0.025 fmol ml \u22121 [43] and 1.97 fmol ml \u22121 [44] ). This is because the signal of the tau protein was amplified by the SERS effect. Compared with SERS, the LOD of our method was limited by the intensity of fluorescence emitted by FITC groups on tau protein. Since the molecular weight of tau protein is over 50 kDa [7] , a concentration of tau-FITC ranging 0-100 pg ml \u22121 (the baseline level of tau concentration in human CSF [9, 10] ) means there are about 2 fmol ml \u22121 FITC groups in the solution, which is too low to be detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer. This is the main aspect that limits the current LOD of our method, which is approximately equal to the highest reported concentration of diseased state in human CSF [31] .

To confirm specificity, we performed selectivity assays. We added interfering molecules such as immunoglobulin G (IgG), human serum albumin (HSA) and BSA. These were introduced to test the selectivity. In this parallel testing, the signals from solutions containing analyte tau protein and blank sample without analyte tau were compared. The results (figure 5) clearly show that the three interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal relative to blank. Only analyte tau protein showed a significant positive signal; the fluorescence intensity of other proteins was close to the blank. Analyte tau still had a positive signal even in the sample with analyte tau as well as IgG, HSA and BSA (concentration of the interfering protein is 20-fold higher than tau).

The increase in fluorescence signal (from tau-FITC) correlates directly with increasing tau concentration. The assay based on antibody-conjugated GO does not require any phase separation steps or wash steps to remove unadsorbed antibodies as in commercial ELISA procedures. Thus, our assay benefits from fewer reagents, lower cost, and less systematic and human errors. The LOD is about 0.14 pmol ml \u22121 , which could be improved further.
