However, accurate viral and immunologic markers to predict clinical outcomes of this patient population are still lacking. Droplet digital PCR assays for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were designed and performed in 64 respiratory samples from 23 patients with influenza virus infection and 73 samples from 19 patients with RSV infection. Samples of patients with hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, or sickle cell disease were included. Clinical information from institutional medical records was reviewed to assess disease severity. Samples from patients with fever or respiratory symptoms had a significantly higher viral loads than those from asymptomatic patients. Samples from patients with influenza virus and RSV infection collected at presentation had significantly higher viral loads than those collected from patients after completing a course of oseltamivir or ribavirin, respectively. RSV loads correlated positively with clinical symptoms in patients \ufffd5 years of age, whereas influenza viral loads were associated with clinical symptoms, irrespective of age. Patients receiving antivirals for influenza and RSV had a significant reduction in viral loads after completing therapy. Digital PCR offers an effective method to monitor the efficacy of antiviral treatment for respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children worldwide [1] . Respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and picornavirus play an important role in the etiology of respiratory diseases in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, especially those undergoing myelosuppression and hematopoietic cell transplant [2] . PLOS Considerable advances have been made in predicting clinical outcomes for several systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), and measuring viral load and markers of immune activation have become part of standard clinical care [3] . Unfortunately, this is not the case for influenza, RSV, and other viral respiratory infections. Despite the enormous global health impact of viral respiratory infections [4] , accurate viral and immune markers to predict clinical outcomes for patients are still lacking. Several methods have been used to precisely correlate viral copy number and disease severity [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Molecular quantitative assays have been suggested to detect and monitor clinical viral respiratory disease, particularly in immunosuppressed pediatric patients [10] . However, their results are conflicting and there continues to be a lack of clinical tests to accurately measure viral load [5, 6, 8, 9] . Furthermore, respiratory infections in these patients are associated with prolonged viral shedding and concerns for emergent antiviral resistance (for those in whom the viral infection is treatable). Quantitative determination of viral load may provide an important tool to directly evaluate the efficiency of antiviral therapy, to determine if changes in therapy are necessary and to assess need for further isolation to protect transmission to other highly susceptible hosts. These problems highlight the importance and potential value of developing assays for absolute, precise and reliable quantitative viral detection to improve the accuracy of clinical decision making in immunocompromised children with viral respiratory infections.",

Quantitative determinations by real-time PCR are indirect and provide a relative quantification of viral load [12] . However, the precision of such assays is limited by the nature of cycle threshold (Ct) determination with resulting values having a relative standard deviation that can exceed 50% [13] [14] [15] . In addition, assay workflow and design is complicated by the need for quantitative calibrators, introducing error risk and requirements for consistent supplies of well-characterized, commutable reference material. The latter can be particularly difficult to obtain for less commonly quantified viruses in general, and particularly for RNA viruses, such as those studied here [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Marked variation in assay performance characteristics and in materials used as calibration has been described. The implementation of international standards, such as those that have been made available by the World Health Organization (WHO) has led to reduction of this problem. However, standards are only available for a limited number of pathogens and can vary over time [22, 23] .",

            "text": "Digital PCR (dPCR) is a PCR method for the detection and quantitation of nucleic acids [14, 18, 24] . dPCR offers several advantages over real time methods [21, 25] . Digital PCR differs from real-time methods in the way the sample target is measured, by dividing up the reaction into multiple, smaller endpoint reactions which allows direct absolute quantification of the target [17, 26, 27] . dPCR methods do not depend on calibration curves [19, 25, 28] and are less subject to enzyme inhibition as they employ endpoint amplification [26, 29, 30] . They are more robust in the presence of viral sequence heterogeneity, showing less susceptibility to mismatches between primers-probe patient viral sequence. Such miss-matches are more likely to cause false-negative results or under-quantitation using qPRC, compared to dPCR [11, 31, 32] . This is particularly important for RNA viruses which have high mutation rates and need only a few weeks to escape immune response or to produce drug-resistant mutants [31, [33] [34] [35] [36] . Finally, clinical results generated by dPCR are more precise, reliable and reproducible than those by real-time PCR, thereby highlighting its potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive utility. Although dPCR has been previously used for quantitative detection of systemic viruses [17, 37, 38] , its use has been more limited for localized viral infections such as those in the respiratory tract.",

For RSV, viral load was significantly associated with severity or presence of respiratory illness in children \ufffd5 years of age. An analysis of cycle threshold values and disease severity in 4410 patients by Fuller et al. showed that in those with RSV infection, viral load was associated with disease severity only in patients younger than 2 years of age [15] . DeVincenzo et al. reported that patients intubated because of RSV-induced respiratory distress had higher viral loads than those who were not, and that higher viral loads were associated with longer hospitalization [5] . We could not measure viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples in our study. However, a study showed that viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts are strongly correlated when measured at the same time [41] . In an autopsy study of patients with fatal RSV LTRI, the viral antigen was extensively present in the lung tissue [42]. This points to a possible association between viral load and RSV disease severity. However, many studies have not found this association [6, 7] . Gerna et al. reported a direct relationship between viral loads and clinical symptoms in their patient cohort, but viral loads were not associated with an increased risk of developing bronchiolitis [7] .",

Some studies report higher viral loads in those with more severe viral disease [9, 43, 44] , whereas others do not show this association [6, 8, 45, [47, 48] , whereas others report an association between viral coinfection and increased [49, 50] or decreased [51, 52] disease severity. Our study did not find significant differences between viral load and signs/symptoms in patients with viral coinfections versus those with a single infection. The presence of one or more viruses did not impact RSV or influenza viral load. Pinky et al. showed that fast-growing viruses can impair the replication of remaining viruses during a coinfection, whereas slow-growing viruses can be inhibited in the presence of other viruses [53] . This mechanism of viral competition during coinfections might explain the discrepancies among studies [53] .",

Assays reported to date have been performed using real-time PCR. dPCR provides advantages such as endpoint quantitation without the need for calibration curves, improved precision, and reduced likelihood of quantitative bias based on amplification efficiency or inhibition [17, 26, 27] . From 137 samples that were initially positive by BioFire FilmArray1, 19 were negative by dPCR. All 19 samples were collected after completion of antiviral treatment. This might be anticipated due to subsampling error in patients with very low viral load or due to some degree of sample degradation in similarly low load samples (near the assay LOD). These results are in agreement with previous work from our group and others on cytomegalovirus, showing that although dPCR exhibits increased precision over qPCR at higher viral loads, diminished sensitivity can be seen in samples with low viral load values, potentially attributable to reduced input sample volume in the dPCR system [66] [67] [68] .",

Clinical information was obtained retrospectively by chart review. Given the lack of commercially available quantitative standards it is difficult to develop quantitative real time PCR methods. Therefore, we did not develop a real time assay to perform a direct comparison of quantification between real-time methods and dPCR but rather sought to develop and validate a digital PCR assay that performs well, correlates with clinical disease and can be used to monitor response to antiviral therapy. A highlight of our study was that most patients in our cohort were immunocompromised and represented a population in which respiratory infections can be severe and could therefore potentially benefit from reliable measurement of viral loads.",
