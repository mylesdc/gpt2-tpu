Affecting the upper respiratory system, symptoms like blocked nose, cough and sneezing are most common [1, 2] . The socioeconomic losses associated with viral respiratory tract infections, however, are huge [3, 4] with enormous direct and indirect costs for our health care system [5] . Colds also pose a threat for the very young or old, ailing and/or high risk groups like immunocompromised patients, COPD patients, asthmatics or lung transplant recipients [1, 6] . A wide range of remedies is sold on prescription and over the counter, but evidence-based medicine systematic reviews conclude that there is still no reliable prevention or cure available and potential serious side effects of popular products also have to be considered. Given the multiple causes of common cold, the Cochrane collaboration suggested to focus future research efforts on non virus-specific compounds [7] . Effective formulations containing antiviral agents are needed for the safe and efficacious treatment of common cold symptoms and the containment of viral propagation. Potential side effects should also be minimal due to the usually nonhazardous nature of the indication.",

Spray solutions were clear, colourless, odourless and free of particles. Verum and placebo nasal sprays were identical in shape, size and colour to allow a double-blind design, and were randomized at the CRO. Before administration, the spray was to be shaken and primed until a fine mist was delivered. One spray application of 140 \u03bcl was delivered to each nostril 3 \u00d7/day for 4 days. On day 1, the first application was taken at study entry (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), the next two applications of the spray were equally spaced through remaining waking hours on day 1. Nasal spray applications on days 2/3/4 were administered equally spaced during waking hours. To control compliance with the study protocol, returned spray bottles were weighted and weights compared to weights on dispensing, thereby evaluating the weight of medication taken over the study period. Subject No. 10 (placebo) missed the first dose on day 1 and 4, the third dose on day 2, and therefore took only 75% of planned doses. All other subjects had 100% compliance according to the diary documentation. In total, 99.3% compliance was reached in this study. Dependent on the time point of inclusion in the study, the expected range of difference in weights was between 2.80 g and 3.36 g. Mean difference in the verum group was 3.12 g (\u00b1 0.84 g), and in Eccles et al. Respiratory Research 2010, 11:108 http://respiratory-research.com/content/11/1/108 placebo group 3.84 g (\u00b1 1.85 g) concluding that more placebo than verum doses were administered. This result supports the good compliance reported by the subjects in the diary. Onset of common cold symptoms (days before visit 1) is displayed in Additional file 1: Table S1 .",

Iota-Carrageenan patient 11 reported three AEs -vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain -used ibuprofen as concomitant medication and was therefore excluded from the efficacy analysis of symptoms. The AEs were not considered to be associated with the study medication. Iota-Carrageenan patient 23 reported migraine and puffy eye lids, used ibuprofen and anti-histamine as concomitant medication and was therefore excluded from the efficacy analysis of symptoms. One Iota-Carrageenan patient reported a loss of voice and another Iota-Carrageenan patient reported a dry mouth. Intermittent epistaxis was reported by a placebo patient. A total of 8 AEs were reported, 2 were rated as possibly related to treatment: dry mouth (Iota-Carrageenan, n = 1) in the ITT and PP groups and puffy eye lids (Iota-Carrageenan, n = 1) (Additional file 3: Table S3 ). Since all side effects were resolved, no special actions were necessary. The small number of AE reports supports in particular the good safety-profile of Iota-Carrageenan as an active agent and Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray components in general.",

Independent reviews of randomised controlled clinical trials on upper respiratory tract infection show limited evidence for a benefit of saline nasal irrigation. However, the use of this treatment is widely accepted and some trials obtained satisfactory results [17] [18] [19] . The nasal cavity is the site of choice for inhibition of common cold virus infection and replication.

It is interesting to note that the expression of the majority of the molecules (FGF-2, Fractalkine, GRO, G-CSF, IL-8, IL-1\u03b1, IP-10, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b12) was reduced in the Iota-Carrageenan group upon treatment, while IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-12p40 were increased. IL-1 receptor antagonist is regarded as counter-acting molecule to IL-1. The role of IL-12p40 during a respiratory infection in humans is not fully understood. A recent study suggested suggest that endogenous IL-12p40 is essential for inhibition of airway hyperresponsiveness and peribronchial fibrosis, but not eosinophilic inflammation, in a murine asthma model with prolonged antigen exposures [20] .",
